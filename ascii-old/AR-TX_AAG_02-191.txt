ABSTRACT
In February, March, and April 2014, American Archaeology Group, LLC, performed an
archaeological survey of the proposed City of Sweetwater Landfill Project in Nolan County, Texas,
under the auspices of Texas Antiquities Permit Number 6796 and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA). The original project area consisted of 134 acres of land that will be
impacted by the proposed landfill construction and is located approximately 5 kilometers northeast
of Sweetwater, Nolan County, Texas. The investigation included pedestrian survey of the enti re
area and mechanical trenching was focused within 3 tracts where the actual impacts will occur totaling
89.36 acres. The project area has been severely impacted by erosion, topsoil removal, brush
clearing, demolition of historic component, and utility right-of-way construction. Based on the
results of the investigation, American Archaeology Group, LLC believes that no important cultural
resources will be affected by the project and recommends that construction within the project area
should be allowed to proceed as planned without further archaeological work.
One large prehistoric site (41NL319) was encountered throughout the entire project area on
both sides of an unnamed tributary to Sweetwater Creek. This site appears to consist of a deflated
surface scatter of eroded flint nodules and primary and secondary flakes with some tertiary flakes
and one fragmentary biface observed. Near the edge of the unnamed tributary to Sweetwater
Creek there appears to be some potential intact deposits. At BHT-42, two burned hearthstones
were located at the surface and a matrix sample was recovered from below the stones,
approximately 8 centimeters below the surface. The entire matrix sample was submitted to Beta
Analytic, Inc. (Beta Analytic Number 382139) for radiocarbon dating in order to at least provide a
date for the deflated deposits.
The results of the radiocarbon dating (Appendix IV) yielded a conventional date of 1790+/30BP [2 Sigma Calibration of Cal AD 135 to 265 (Cal BP 1815 to 1685) and Cal AD 275 to 330
(Cal BP 1675 to 1620)], thus dating the remnant prehistoric occupations to at least the Transitional
Archaic time period or younger. This also provides some additional regional data pertaining to
cultural occupations and potential rates of erosion and effects of deflation.
41NL319 also contained an historic component located in the northern-central portion of
Tract 2. The historic component appeared to be late Nineteenth to mid-Twentieth Century ranch/
farmstead that was demolished by bulldozing and the structures destroyed. The historic component
appeared to have a pole barn with galvanized roofing, a root cellar, a residence, and other small
structures. However, the majority of the historic component was subjected to razing in the past with
a bulldozer; barbed wire fencing material and a mixture of debris was pushed into the former cellar.
Site 41NL319 is not considered eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) nor worthy of State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) status, since it contains no intact deposits
within the three tracts. However, the rest of the areas outside of the three identified tracts are set
aside as greenbelt reserves. If future impacts will occur in these areas, archaeological investigations
should be carried out to determine if any intact cultural deposits exist along the creek. No artifacts
were collected, therefore no curation was arranged.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Sweetwater plans to construct a proposed landfill on the south side of the
Sweetwater Creek in Nolan County, Texas (Figure 1). The project area is depicted on the 1981
photorevised Eskota 7.5' U.S.G.S. topographic quadrangle map (Figure 2). The U.T.M.
coordinates for the approximate center of the tract are Northing 3596257 and Easting 3745722.
The project was funded by the City of Sweetwater and conducted under the auspices of Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 6796, and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA). The project area is bounded by Sweetwater Creek on the northwest side by an
unnamed tributary of Sweetwater Creek and on the south by Interstate 20 (Figure 2). The nearest
water source is an unnamed tributary to Sweetwater Creek that transects the project area between
Tracts 1 and 2, and north-south in the western portion of the project area.. Elevations within the
project area range from approximately 2,035 to 2,090 feet above mean sea level (amsl).
The project area was divided into three tracts to be surveyed. Although the original area
to survey consisted of 134 acres, the City of Sweetwater identified three tracts where the proposed
landfill will be excavated (Figure 2). Tract 1 was located in the northeast portion of the overall
project area and consisted of 36.75 acres. Tract 2 consisted of 18.42 acres in the central portion
of the overall project area. Tract 3 consisted of 34.19 acres in the southern portion of the project
area. Additionally, the access to all three tracts is an existing gravel road along the eastern
boundary (and fence) and the existing pipeline right-of-way between Tracts 2 and 3. The
extreme western portions are buffer areas that will not be impacted and will serve as
preserved areas.
Because the property is public land owned by the city, according to provisions of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), all ground-disturbing activities within it must be preceded or
accompanied by archaeological investigations conducted by qualified professional archaeologists.
The rules and regulations of the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC),
which is the state agency which administers the ACT, are also applicable to development of the
property and previous archaeological studies have identified significant prehistoric and historic sites
in Nolan County. Therefore, an archaeological investigation of the project area was required before
construction work could proceed.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
Sellards (1932), compiled a comprehensive regional context for the geology of the Nolan
County area in his publication, Geology of Texas. Interested readers or those unacquainted with the
subject are referred to that excellent treatise for additional information. Briefly, the surface geology
of the area includes an outcrop of Whitehorse Sandstone and Cloud Chief Gypsum formations
from the Permian era. The Whitehorse geological formation is overlaid by the Lingos formation
(Geologic Atlas, Big Spring Sheet, 1974) in Tract 1, which is Quaternary in age but much of it has
been removed by topsoil removal.
Soils
The project area contains three distinct soil types: Acme-Cottonwood complex, 1 to 5 percent
slopes, Quinlan loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes, and Burson-Quinlan association, hilly (Natural
Resources Conservation Service, 2014). The Acme-Cottonwood complex, 1 to 5 percent slopes is a
loamy alluvium on plains. Typical soils profile consists of 0-18 inches of loam with underlying
bedrock (NRCS 2014). The Burson-Quinlan association, hilly is a gravelly, silty, and clayey
residuum located on ridges and hill slopes. Typical soils profile consists of 0-7 inches loam with
underlying bedrock. The Quinlan loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes, is a residuum weathered from
sandstone on hill slopes. Typical soils profile consists of 0-13 inches of loam with underlying
bedrock.

REGIONAL SETTING
This section is adapted from and closely follows McDaniel (2003) and Jackson (2003).
The interested reader may also wish to consult Bradford (1934), Monde (1995), Nolan County
Historical Commission (1985a, 1985b), Sweetwater Reporter (1994), Wade (1960), Wilson
(1932), and Yeats and Shelton (1975) for additional information on these topics.
Located in west central Texas, Nolan County is named for Philip Nolan, an explorer and
mustang trader in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi during the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries who was born in Belfast, Ireland, in 1771. Nolan was a colorful and mysterious
character who achieved notoriety for his political intrigues with the Spanish government at San
Antonio de Bexar and for his famous illicit expedition into Texas in 1800. After journeying
from Natchez, Mississippi, to a location near a tributary of the Brazos River in east Texas, Nolan
and his well-armed cohorts built a small fortress with corrals and began gathering mustangs.
In 1801, he was killed during a conflict with Spanish troops from Nacogdoches and his men
were captured and imprisoned for many years. According to McDaniel (2003), Nolan is seen by
many historians principally as the first of a long line of filibusterers whose challenges to Spanish
and Mexican authority led to the Texas independence.
The counties surrounding Nolan County include Taylor County to the east, Coke and
Runnels Counties to the south, Mitchell County to the west, and Fisher County to the north.
Nolan County is part of the lower plains and the western end of the Callahan Divide extends
through the southern part of the county. Rolling uplands dominate the northern part of the
county. The remainder consists of plateaus traversed by valleys.
Cottonwood, Bitter, Stink, and Sweetwater Creeks drain the northern part of the county
into the Clear Fork of the Brazos River. Silver, Wilson, Fish, and Oak Creeks drain the southern
part into the Colorado River. Soils are principally deep, clayey or loamy sub-soils and
lime accumulations. Hackberry, scrub post oak, cottonwood, and mesquite trees grow in the
riparian zones, and Rocky Mountain junipers or scrub cedars dominate the uplands. Rainfall
averages
22.19 inches per year, and the county has a growing season that averages 221 days. Temperatures
range from an average minimum of 30Â° F in January to an average maximum of 96Â° F in July.
Settlement of the Nolan County area began after the Civil War when buffalo hunters came
to the plains. In 1876, the county was created from the Young-Bexar territory but was initially
administered by the Shackelford County government. Knight's store on Sweetwater Creek was
started in a dugout in 1877 to serve local buffalo hunters. In 1879, the first post office was
opened at Sweet Water, the spelling of which was officially changed to one word in 1918. By
1880, the county economy was dominated by the cattle industry and included 52 ranches that
produced 24,515 cattle and 1,300 sheep. Sixty-four acres were devoted to growing corn, then the
county's most important crop. The 1880 county population was 640. Sweetwater became the
county seat after the election of 1881, when the Texas and Pacific Railway arrived in the area and

5

the countyâs first newspaper, the Sweetwater Advocate, began publication.
During the next few decades, several other towns were built as existing railways grew or
new railroads arrived. These include Roscoe, which was established in 1890 at Vista Station
along the Texas and Pacific Railway; Blackwell, built in 1906 on the Kansas City, Mexico and
Orient Railway; Jamestown; and Maryneal. In 1908, the Roscoe, Snyder and Pacific Shortline
Railway was built from Roscoe to Fluvanna, a distance of about 50 miles, and there were 15 post
offices in the county. The population of the county grew from 2,611 in 1900 to 11,999 by 1910.
By 1910, two-thirds of the land in the county was in agricultural use, much of it worked
by sharecropping tenants. About 16,000 cattle and 7,454 sheep were produced, 33,000 acres were
devoted to cotton growing, and 21,000 acres were planted in sorghum. Cotton production
dominated the local agricultural economy and continued to expand rapidly until the Great
Depression of the 1930s, when nearly a third of the farmers left their land. The number of tenant
farmers in the area dropped from 665 in 1930 to 628 by 1935 and to 440 by 1940, when there
were only 948 farms in Nolan County and the population had declined to 17,309.
The local economy was revived significantly during World War II and by establishment
of the petroleum industry in the area during the late 1930s, but farming continued to decline until
1978, when there were only 472 farms in the county. The petroleum industry began with the first
strikes in 1939, but production was only nominal. By 1948, just 3,353 barrels of crude oil were
produced in the entire county, but production rose to 8,315,000 barrels in 1956, 5,331,000 barrels
in 1960, 4,900,000 barrels in 1974, 2,400,000 barrels in 1978, and 2,873,000 barrels by 1982.
The countyâs petroleum products increased in value from $5,243,000 in 1966 to $92,415,782 by
1984, and remained important to the local economy during the 1990s even though prices and
production both fell gradually after the mid-1980s. Between 1939, when production started, and
early 1991, about 172,176,000 barrels of crude oil were extracted from county lands.
County population rose modestly during the 1970s to a total of 17,359 by 1980, but
slowly dwindled during the 1980s and 1990s. By 1990 it had slumped to 16,594. In recent years,
the countyâs population continues to slowly decline with agriculture and the petroleum industry
continuing to dominate the local economy. Most of the countyâs land has remained as ranches or
farms producing principally cattle, sheep, Angora goats, hogs, cotton, sorghum, wheat, and hay,
or such supplementary items as peaches, pecans, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, and watermelons.
Production of cattle and livestock products accounts for about half of the farming and ranching
economy, and crop production makes up the balance. Petroleum, natural gas, gypsum, rock, sand,
and gravel are also produced.
Major industries in the county include United States Gypsum, begun near Sweetwater in
1924, the various railroads that continue to serve the area and the Trent Mesa Wind Project
recently established by American Electric Power. The latter includes 100 wind-driven turbine
units extending between Abilene and Sweetwater that each generates 1.5 megawatts of
electricity. The Texas State Technical College began operation at Sweetwater in 1970. Lake

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
This section is compiled primarily from information obtained from the Texas Historical
Commissionâs (2014) Texas Sites Atlas (TSA) online database, where detailed data on many
previously recorded archeological sites and cultural resource surveys in Texas is stored.
Nolan County is within the Lower Plains archaeological region (Biessart et. al. 1985:76),
which contains 31 counties. When the overview of the regionâs archaeology was compiled by the
Office of the State Archeologist in 1985, there were no sites recorded in Nolan County. However,
recent work at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory has resulted in an examination of early
reports on sites and the assignment of site numbers based on records and maps.
The culture history of the region spans approximately the last 11,500 years and the
prehistory of the region has been extensively studied at the Lubbock Lake Site (41LU1) in
Lubbock County (Johnson 1987). Prehistoric archaeological sites in much of this region are
preserved in three broad geomorphic contexts: sand dunes, draws, and ancient lake basins, or
playas. Draw sites are often the best preserved of these types and therefore offer the greatest
potential for fruitful research (cf. Holiday 1997; Johnson and Holiday 1995).
The geomorphic setting of much of Nolan County does not conform to this regional
pattern and instead consists of a series of limestone-capped hills and ridges punctuated by broad
slopes and stream valleys. Thin stony clays and clay loams dominate the upland soil assemblages
and in the valley and alluvial terrace zones these soils are mixed with sands, sandy loams, silts,
and sandy silts. Sandstone outcrops are also generally present on slopes and in valleys, and both
limestone and sandstone were used as heating elements in prehistoric hot rock earth ovens and
other hot rock activity features in the area. Such features include isolated, relatively small
hearths, and larger burned rock midden accumulations.
High quality chert is widely available, primarily from uplands sources, but also as
modest-sized nodules in local stream beds. According to descriptions on TSA site forms for the
county, and as observed by AAG archeologists in the field, local cherts occur in a variety of
colors including tan, cream, black, purplish, yellow, and brown, and substantial quartzite of a
cream to off-white color is present in the area. In addition to Edwards-derived cherts, significant
quantities of Tecovas chert are apparently found in lithic procurement or reduction contexts
within the areaâs prehistoric archaeological sites (Harrington 1979).
When accessed in 2014 by the AAG staff, the TSA database listed 318 archaeological
sites that were previously recorded in Nolan County. The database contained abstract references
or other data for 12 cultural resource management investigations that occurred in the county
(Burton 1982; Harrison 1979, 1981; Henderson 1986; Henry 1992; Hunt 1991; Nash et al. 2001;
and State Department of Highways and Public Transportation [subsequently Texas Department
of Transportation] 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985a, 1985b).

Systematic archaeological work in the county was begun during the late 1920s and early
1930s by pioneering Texas and Southwest regional archeologist Edwin B. (âTedâ) Sayles.
During this period, Sayles conducted numerous brief surveys, primarily along stream valleys in
the vicinity of Sweetwater, and recorded the landscape contexts and other characteristics of
several types of prehistoric sites. Although most of these were either rather unremarkable lithic
procurement and testing sites or lithic reduction sites situated in both upland and floodplain
contexts, there were also several isolated, well- preserved hearths, burned rock middens, cairn
and crevice burials, stone circle burials, rock water basins, and even sites that contained
petroglyphs, stone mortar holes, and incised sandstone figurines. Sayles discovered and
documented over two dozen sites in contexts varying from open camps to rockshelters and
terrace deposits during this interval and assigned cultural affiliations to the sites based on the
classifications that must then have been in vogue. His site forms include such categories of
affiliation as Wichita-Sand Dune-Cut, Central Texas Hunting, Valley Creek, and Abilene.
This activity occurred during the formative period for both Saylesâ personal
archaeological career and also for archaeological research in Texas. In the fall of 1928, Sayles
and Dr. Cyrus N. Ray, an osteopathic surgeon who resided and practiced in Abilene, held a
meeting with several other archaeological enthusiasts in Rayâs offices. Many of the participants
were faculty members at McMurry College and Simmons University in Abilene. The Texas
Archaeological and Paleontological Society was founded during the meeting. For several years
during the early 1930s, Sayles served as secretary-treasurer of the society, which was the
predecessor organization of the Texas Archeological Society.
Shortly after he completed his Nolan County surveys and helped found the society, Sayles
was hired by H. R. Gladwin, founder and director of the prestigious Gila Pueblo Research
Institution in Globe, Arizona, to complete a major statewide survey of Texas archaeology. The
landmark research project was completed and published in 1935. Sayles career subsequently
continued to flourish and reached a plateau during the 1940s and 1950s when he served as both
curator and photographer for the Arizona State Museum (cf. Davis 1979:159-194; Reid and
Doyel [eds.] 1992:77, 80, 94, 144, 148, 200, 410).
During his stint at the museum, Sayles participated in excavation of the famous Lehner
Site in southeastern Arizona, which contained 13 Clovis projectile points among the remains of
nine Columbian mammoths and a late-Pleistocene bison, horse, and tapir. Along with such
distinguished colleagues as Emil Haury and Ernst Antevs, Sayles also participated in seminal
investigations into the pre-ceramic Cochise Culture, and the later Anasazi, Mogollon, and
Hohokam cultures of the southwest United States and northern Mexico.
Based on the TSA records, following Sayles investigations in the Sweetwater area during
the 1920s and 1930s, there seems to have been a gap of many decades in the sequence of
archaeological work in Nolan County. Apparently not much work occurred in the county from
the time of Sayles departure to Arizona until the late 1960s, when a few sites began to be
investigated and recorded in conjunction with various public construction projects for which

9

archaeological surveys were required under new federal and state cultural resource protection
statutes and regulations. The principal laws involved included the National Historic Preservation
Act, which took effect in 1966, and the Antiquities of Code of Texas, which was implemented
in 1969. From the time those laws became effective to the present, several cultural resource
surveys, including the current AAG investigation, occurred in Nolan County in order to meet
statutory and regulatory requirements of the National Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
and the Texas Historical Commission.
An exception may be the work of Foy Steadman, who surveyed and recorded several
dozen prehistoric archaeological sites in the county. Although TSA records are not definitive,
apparently Steadman conducted his surveys during the 1990s mostly on private lands and without
backing from any institutional or financial sponsor, simply for the purpose of furthering
knowledge of the countyâs prehistoric cultural resources. He concentrated his efforts on stream
valleys in the northeastern part of the county. He documented and collected many chipped,
ground, and polished stone tools during his surveys, including numerous Paleo-Indian projectile
points, several corner-tang knives, and a hematite pendant, found at the surfaces of the sites he
explored (Texas Historical Commission 2003).
The investigation by Henderson (1986) of portions of prehistoric archaeological site
41NL20, on the south terrace of Sweetwater Creek at County Road 216, for the State Department
of Highways and Public Transportation (now the Texas Department of Transportation), is the
only significant archeological study near the AAG project area. Henderson (1986) tested the site
for significance and determined that it contained only a small quantity of chert debitage and one
partially intact hearth feature. Based on the results of her investigation, Henderson (1986)
concluded that the site was not eligible either for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places or designation as a State Archeological Landmark.
Noteworthy among the other contract archaeological surveys conducted in the county in
recent years are the investigations, performed in seven phases during the late 1990s and early
2000s, for the previously-described Trent Wind Farm Project sponsored by the American Electric
Company (Nash et al. 2001). During these surveys, several dozen prehistoric archaeological sites
were discovered and recorded along the project corridor between Abilene and Sweetwater.
Unfortunately, nearly all of the sites included in the TSA database that might otherwise
have been subjected to additional studies based on the results of recent state-of-the-art surveys
were poorly preserved or otherwise unremarkable and were dismissed from further investigation
after the initial surveys were completed. Those few that were tested for significance yielded only
sparse information about the prehistoric cultures of Nolan County and were deemed ineligible for
designation as State Archeological Landmarks or inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places. Therefore, much work remains to be done toward understanding the countyâs
archeological record and its historic and ancient past.
41NL21 is a prehistoric camp site recorded in 1929 by E.B. Sayles located 8 miles
northeast of Sweetwater on Bitter Creek. This site measured 200x500 feet in size and appeared to
have only 4 inches of cultural deposits. Sayles collected 167 bags of sherds and also noted a
hearth present. This site is approximately 3.66 kilometers northeast of the current project.

10

41NL22 is a prehistoric camp site recorded in 1929 by E.B. Sayles located 5 miles northeast
of Sweetwater on Sweetwater Creek. This site measured approximately 2 acres in size and
appeared to contain 6-8 inches of cultural deposits. Sayles collected 168 bags of sherds. This site
is approximately 1.81 kilometers northeast of the current project. Bradle et. al. (2003) surveyed the
area and defined the site boundaries.
41NL24 is a prehistoric camp site recorded in 1929 by E.B. Sayles located 6 miles east of
Sweetwater on Bitter Creek. This site measured 600x800 feet in size and appeared to have 12-18
inches of cultural deposits. Sayles also reported excavating a cairn burial on an adjoining hill. The
site also contains gravels and flint that covered the hill. It appears that this site is approximately
2.65 kilometers southeast of the current project area.

PROJECT METHODOLOGY
The project was divided into three phases: archival and historical background research, field
survey, and report preparation. The background research consisted of review of the archaeological
site records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and of previous work in the
County, principally through examination data contained in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
online database.
The field investigation was conducted in February, March, and April 2014. Michael R.
Bradle was the Project Archaeologist and Herbert G. Uecker served as the Principal Investigator.
The Principal Investigator and Project Archaeologist led the project with assistance from David
C. Scott, Fred Mims, Leroy Forbes, and David Bradle. The project area was examined utilizing
the pedestrian survey method augmented by backhoe trenching. Fifty-nine backhoe trenches were
excavated. No subsurface cultural deposits were encountered during these tests.
Backhoe trenches were excavated in high probability areas and areas that could be
accessed due to dense vegetation in areas within the project area, concentrated along the edges
of the project area in close proximity to Sweetwater Creek, and all were negative (Appendix
II). Each trench was one meter wide and three meters in length, but depths varied from .22
meter to 3.74 meters. Backdirt was sampled by screening matrix through 1/4-inch hardware
cloth, and excavated column samples from backhoe trench walls.
In addition, all disturbed surfaces were examined for exposures of cultural materials.
Disturbances from previous activities within the project area such as pipeline and utility
construction, erosion and deflation, topsoil removal, trash dumping, water line construction, sewer
line construction, and bulldozing, afforded numerous opportunities to examine subsurface deposits.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
During the AAG study, one archaeological site with an historic and a prehistoric component,
41NL319, was recorded. It was determined that the entire study area was previously impacted by
pipeline and utility construction, topsoil removal, and extensive land clearing (Figure 4). Future
impacts will be possible gypsum mining as evidenced by such activities on adjacent properties and
landfill construction. The entire 134 acres was subjected to a pedestrian surface survey but the only
areas subjected to subsurface testing were the three tracts identified in Figure 2, totaling 89.36
acres. The prehistoric component was found to exist over the entire 134 acres. The area between
Tracts 1 and 2 have been subjected to extensive erosion, and two-wheeled traffic and no significant
deposits were located in that area as well.
The distribution of lithics across the project are was fairly uniform along with chert nodules
that eroded out of the geologic formations. There were some noted differences in select areas. For
example, the area in and around the locality of BHT-6 contained primary and secondary flakes on
the surface. BHT-9 had a higher density of flakes on the surface than other backhoe trenches. Near
BHT-10, a small fragmentary biface with a snap-fracture was observed near the surface in a
disturbed context. It was not a diagnostic artifact and was not collected.
The general area in and around BHT-39, BHT-40, and BHT-41 contained flakes on the
surface. However, the area around BHT-41 had a greater surface density of flakes. No subsurface
deposits were found in any of the backhoe trenches.
During the course of the pedestrian survey, AAG personnel noted the presence of burned
rock and several hearth stones on the surface. This indicated the presence of potential sub-surface
intact cultural deposits. AAG defined the area of high potential for additional subsurface cultural
deposits and this area was set aside as a preserved area (Appendix IIIa). The combined acreage for
the area to be preserved is 5.48 acres located along the east side of an intermittent tributary to
Sweetwater Creek.
The area between BHT-41 and BHT-44 contained a surface scatter of flakes and several
pieces of burned rock. At BHT-42, two burned hearthstones were located at the surface and a
matrix sample was recovered from below the stones, approximately 8 centimeters below the
surface. The entire matrix sample was submitted to Beta Analytic, Inc. (Beta Analytic Number
382139) for radiocarbon dating in order to at least provide a date for the deflated deposits.
The results of the radiocarbon dating (Appendix IV) yielded a conventional date of 1790+/30BP [2 Sigma Calibration of Cal AD 135 to 265 (Cal BP 1815 to 1685) and Cal AD 275 to 330
(Cal BP 1675 to 1620)], thus dating the remnant prehistoric occupations to at least the Transitional
Archaic time period or younger. This also provides some additional regional data pertaining to
cultural occupations and potential rates of erosion and effects of deflation.

Figure 4. Northwest view of Tract 1. Note the extensive soil removal and sub-surface
gypsum deposits now located on the surface.
Throughout the project area, gypsum was found at varying depths (Figure 5). Some of the
soil deposits in a few areas appeared to be much deeper than the soils data reported from the
Natural Resources Conservation Service. It appeared that due to the extensive erosion in the project
area, small ravines and valleys were filled with re-deposited sediments.
Predominately, the project area contained a moderate density of vegetation and brush (Figure
6). The only portion that had any vast open areas was Tract 1 in the northeastern portion of the
project area where extensive topsoil removal had occurred (Figure 4). The entire project area has
been subjected to serious deflation, thus leaving a lithic scatter across the project surface (Figure
7). Figure 8 is an example of a typical profile (BHT-49) of the soil deposits encountered with
gypsum deposits encountered underlying varying depths of soil deposits.

Figure 9. Southwest view of remnant pole barn at historic component of 41NL319.
Due to the extensive impacts to the project area and the razing of the historic component at
41NL319, AAG conducted extensive archival research of the Nolan County Deed Records (Figures 10
and 11). The data in Figures 10 and 11 are a compendium of all deeds involving the project area as
well as adjacent properties in Sections 38 and 39 for future historical research. None of the names
appear to be associated with any significant historical event.
The historic component at 41NL319 consisted of a farmstead or ranching complex located in
the north central portion of Tract 2 approximately 60x38 meters in size (Appendix IIIa). This component
appeared to contain a possible root cellar, possible house mound, and the remnants of a pole barn
(Appendix IIIb). There was also a depression with bulldozed debris located on the northern side of the
pole barn (6x6m). It contained tin, barbed wire, and wood. Shovel probing proved up that it was a hole
excavated to bury the debris after razing this site. Another pile of bulldozed debris was located on the
southeast side of the two-track road that appeared also to contain tin roofing material, barbed wire, and
wood debris.
The only two features at the historic component appeared to be the possible root cellar and
the possible house mound. The root cellar was approximately 4x5 meters facing the northeast and
had an earthen embankment around ti at least a half-meter in height. BHT-59 was excavated into the
root cellar to determine if any intact deposits were present. This was done slowly but the area appeared
to have been impacted in the past. There were no structural elements discovered and it appeared that
when the site was bulldozed, this feature was used to push wood, metal, and barbed wire into it and

17

buried. Soils matrix was screened in an effort to locate any artifacts that might date this feature. None
were found.
The second feature that appeared to be intact or fairly uniform was a possible house mound that
was 3.5x6 meters in size. It was slightly elevated and rectangular in shape. Two shovel tests (ST1
and ST2) were excavated in the northeastern and southeastern ends in an attempt to locate any
subsurface deposits. No artifacts were recovered from this feature (Figure 12).
Overall, the historic component has been severely impacted and destroyed by previous razing
of structures in the past. In the mixture of the bulldozed piles, a few square nails and many wire
nails were observed along with a few brick fragments, including one with âABILENEâ imprinted on
it. This indicated that the site may have had a possible structure present from the 1880-1920 era but the
remainder appears to be from the 1930-1970 era.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the results of the AAG study, it is recommended that the City of Sweetwater
Landfill Project should be allowed to proceed as planned without further archeological work.
However, in the event that previously undocumented archaeological resources are encountered
during construction, all work in the immediate vicinity of such finds should be suspended until
the finds can be examined and evaluated by AAG in consultation with the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission, the City of Sweetwater, and Enprotec/Hibbs & Todd, Inc.
Based on additional surficial inspections, we believe that the site (41NL319) extends
further to the north along Sweetwater Creek and further to the east and west. This site appears
to consist of a deflated surface scatter of eroded flint nodules and primary and secondary flakes
with some tertiary flakes and one fragmentary biface. Near the edge of the unnamed tributary to
Sweetwater Creek there appears to be some potential intact deposits. Site 41NL319 (Only the
portions in Tracts 1, 2, and 3 and the area between Tracts 1 and 2) is not considered eligible for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nor worthy of State
Antiquities Landmark (SAL) status, since it contains no intact deposits within the three tracts.
However, the rest of the areas outside of the identified tracts are set aside as greenbelt reserves.
If future impacts are to occur in these areas, archaeological investigations should be carried
out to determine if any intact cultural deposits exist along the creek and assess those areas for
significance and eligibility for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) designations.
Future investigations in the vicinity of this project area should address the areal extent of
this site. It is recommended that a buffer area as defined by AAG in Appendix IIIc with GPS
coordinates be set aside as a preserved area. In consultation with the City of Sweetwater and
Enprotec/Hibbs & Todd, Inc., all parties agreed that this area would be a greenbelt preserve and
protected from future impacts. If future impacts are proposed, then additional archaeological
surveys are recommended in order to refine any boundaries for 41NL319, and determine the
extents of any subsurface cultural deposits that might be present. This proposed buffer area
along the unnamed tributary to Sweetwater Creek is deemed not worthy of a SAL designation,
and undetermined for inclusion on the NRHP at this time. If future investigations reveal
significant cultural deposits or artifact assemblages, then NRHP nomination should be considered.
No further work is recommended within this project area and monitoring by an
archaeologist is not recommended. Construction for the new landfill should be allowed to
proceed immediately.

APPENDIX I: RESEARCH DESIGN AND SCOPE OF WORK
RESEARCH DESIGN
Records Check
Prior to entering the field, American Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G.) will contact the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, the state repository for site
records on Texas, to determine if previously recorded sites are present in the project area. This task
may be conducted by a personal visit to TARL or by telephone.
The library at A.A.G. is very extensive, especially regarding reports for the project area
region, and much of the archival work can be accomplished in-house. Since A.A.G. has conducted
work in the area, much of the background work has already been accomplished.
Permit Application
No fieldwork will commence until a permit from the Archeology Division (AD) of the Texas
Historical Commission has been issued. An application for an antiquities permit will be submitted to
AD-THC as soon as A.A.G. receives Notice To Proceed. Normally, A.A.G. discusses the project
with AD personnel before beginning any fieldwork. This is done to ensure that both parties are in
agreement as to the level of work required for this project.
Survey Methods
The entire project area will be 100% intensively surveyed utilizing the pedestrian survey
method supported by shovel testing and/or augering and examination of eroded and disturbed areas
where cultural materials may be visible on the surface. Herbert G. Uecker will act as the Principal
Investigator. Shovel testing, augering, and backhoe trenching will meet and exceed the Minimum
Survey Standards For Texas established by the THC.
In areas of poor visibility, and environmental settings that have potential for buried cultural
materials, shovel testing will be required and tests will be concentrated in areas of high site
probability and randomly across the project area. All excavated fill from shovel tests will be screened
through 1/4-inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests will be manually excavated to sterile clay or bedrock
when possible.
The survey crew will be equipped with shovel test forms, notebooks, camera, compass, and a
project area map for accurate plotting of shovel tests, backhoe trenches, and archaeological sites. In
addition to shovel testing as a means of identifying buried sites, select areas in alluvial settings or
areas with some appreciable soil depth will be subjected to backhoe trenching. All sites identified in
the project area will be mapped in the field and plotted on a topographic map. Site locations will also
be determined through the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS). Each site will be recorded
using the official State of Texas Archeological Site Form. In no case will the survey crew work
outside of the project area as depicted on the project area map provided by the client.

25

Only diagnostic artifacts will be collected from the surface. All artifacts recovered through
shovel testing will be collected. These specimens will be bagged and recorded on a field sack log.
They will be analyzed and prepared for eventual curation at TARL, unless a petition to discard is
prepared and accepted.
The draft report will be submitted to AD-THC for review. Once the report has been approved
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), copies will be delivered to AD-THC and the
client. A.A.G. will maintain copies of the notes, photographs, site forms, and any other records
produced from the project deemed to be a work product.
Scope of Work
I.

Conduct background check for previously recorded archaeological sites in the project area
and the vicinity. Review the relevant literature.

II.

Discuss the project with the AD-THC reviewer assigned to this project before entering the
field.

RE: Radiocarbon Dating Result For Sample AAG-191
Dear Mr. Bradle:
Enclosed is the radiocarbon dating result for one sample recently sent to us. As usual, specifics of
the analysis are listed on the report with the result and calibration data is provided where applicable. The
Conventional Radiocarbon Age has been corrected for total fractionation effects and where applicable,
calibration was performed using 2013 calibration databases (cited on the graph pages).
The web directory containing the table of results and PDF download also contains pictures, a cvs
spreadsheet download option and a quality assurance report containing expected vs. measured values for
3-5 working standards analyzed simultaneously with your samples.
The reported result is accredited to ISO-17025 standards and all pretreatments and chemistry
were performed here in our laboratories and counted in our own accelerators here in Miami. Since Beta is
not a teaching laboratory, only graduates trained to strict protocols of the ISO-17025 program participated
in the analysis.
As always Conventional Radiocarbon Ages and sigmas are rounded to the nearest 10 years per
the conventions of the 1977 International Radiocarbon Conference. When counting statistics produce
sigmas lower than +/- 30 years, a conservative +/- 30 BP is cited for the result.
When interpreting the result, please consider any communications you may have had with us
regarding the sample. As always, your inquiries are most welcome. If you have any questions or would
like further details of the analysis, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Thank you for prepaying the analyses. As always, if you have any questions or would like to
discuss the results, donât hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,

Digital signature on file
