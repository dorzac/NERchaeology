Management Summary
In May 2005, the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) entered into a new Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) with the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The new MOU replaced a previous
Memorandum of Agreement that the agencies had entered into in August 1989. As with the previous
agreement document, the new MOU allows the LCRA archaeology department to conduct construction
monitoring, archaeological surface reconnaissance, and intensive cultural resource surveys on new and
existing tracts, facilities, transmission lines, and substations 300 acres or less in size under authorization
of a yearly blanket Texas Antiquities Committee Archeology Permit issued for the calendar year. Such
projects are submitted to THC through interim reports that THC reviews and comments on during a 30day review process. These reports are then finalized and included in the Annual Report.
There are two notable exceptions to these Standard Review and Reporting Procedures. The first is for
small (less than 2 acre in size), negative (no archaeological sites present) field surveys. The results of
such projects are summarized in memo form for LCRA project managers and then compiled in the
Annual Report for ex post facto THC review.
The second is for maintenance projects that involve routine and/or periodic potentially ground-disturbing
activities in areas that have been previously disturbed by initial construction or through a history of
similar activities. These are primarily for transmission line rights-of-way (ROW) but may also include
fence repair and replacement, prescribed burns, and existing fire lane and road maintenance. Such
projects receive at minimum a file review that evaluates previous levels of investigation and locations of
previously identified sites that are potentially eligible or listed as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
If warranted, such projects will also undergo field surveys that will typically focus on high probability
areas where ground disturbance is expected. Recommendations for any site or ground disturbance
avoidance areas are then communicated to LCRA project managers in memo form, and likewise compiled
in the Annual Report for ex post facto THC review.
Additionally, some projects are reviewed by LCRA archaeologists are considered to not require an
archaeological survey, typically because they are in low probability areas, have been previously disturbed,
or have been previously evaluated. In such cases letters are sent to the THC reviewer explaining the
rationale for such recommendations. As with interim reports, THC reviews and comments on these
within a 30-day review period. These letters are also included in the Annual Report.
During 2009, the LCRA’s Archeology Services staff conducted 69 in-house cultural resource assessments
under Antiquities Permit No. 5141. These were in 34 counties in west, west-central, central, and southcentral Texas. Total project acreage totaled approximately 1,911 acres, although a large percentage of
this was from long transmission line projects that were cleared through file searches. Actual on-theground survey projects totaled 1245.1 acres, although 810 of these are from the Double Horn Resource
Area report that summarized several years of inventory and project-related investigations, leaving 735.1
acres actively investigated during 2009. The balance is roughly comparable to the 765 acres investigated
during 2008.
Forty-five previously unrecorded archaeological sites received trinomial designations. These 45 sites
consisted of 43 prehistoric components and six historic components. Of these, 12 were considered to be
potentially eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark and one was felt to be eligible
(41MS87 near Fort Mason).
One hundred and sixty-eight previously recorded archaeological sites were assessed, either in the field or
through file searches. These consisted of 153 historic components and 30 historic components. Of these,
66 were considered potentially eligible, 25 to be eligible, and two were listed as SALs (41BT36 and
i

41BT37 in LCRA’s Double Horn Resource Area). One extensive file review project, Project 5.09 that
had been previously surveyed by others over multiple occasions was not tabulated.
Draft cultural resource survey reports (interim reports) for 11 of these projects were submitted to the
Archeology Division (AD) of the THC throughout the year. These are compiled in Part 1 of the Annual
Report, with sensitive locational information redacted from copies for public distribution. Interim Report
3.09, on the Double Horn Resource Area, was not submitted previously, as it was a summary of numerous
previous investigations, and no project-related concurrence was needed.
The Double Horn Resource Area report is the first of a series on larger LCRA landholdings, mainly along
the Highland Lakes, that have been investigated at various capacities and for various reasons over the past
30 years. This is an effort to summarize what is known about each of these tracts, and also to allow for
the curation of artifacts collected on these properties over the years. At Double Horn alone there are 23
archaeological sites, including prehistoric sites and historic sites associated with the early Double Horn
community, including two listed SALs and 16 sites that are considered either eligible or potentially
eligible for listing.
Other notable projects reported upon included various ongoing projects at LCRA’s new Pedernales River
Nature Park in Johnson City, where at least two prehistoric archaeological sites may have additional
research value. A 110-acre brush clearing project at LCRA’s Cedar Point on Lake Buchanan in Llano
County resulted in the recording six new archaeological sites, two of which are considered potentially
significant. Five new prehistoric sites were recorded and four previously recorded sites were revisited
and flagged for avoidance. A transmission line rebuild project between Llano and Mason, in Llano and
Mason counties resulted in the recording 18 new archaeological sites. Most were minor lithic scatters but
pointed towards aspects of resource use and settlement patterning in the Llano Uplift. This project also
resulted in the recording of multicomponent site 41MS87, which contains two limekilns associated with
the building and/or maintenance of nearby Fort Mason, as well as apparent fortifications or small sentry
posts. The prehistoric component contained an intact sandstone burned rock midden, one of few such
features known in the region.
Forty-five projects were cleared through internal memos. These are compiled in Part 2 of this report.
Many of these were transmission line maintenance projects, and many of those consisted of file and map
reviews. Thirteen of the projects involved field surveys, and the remaining 23 consisted of desktop
reviews. Calendar year 2009 provided an opportunity to visit LCRA’s most distant and remote
transmission line, T-271, which runs across the Delaware Mountains in Culberson County. Five new
archaeological sites were recorded and four previously recorded sites were flagged for avoidance.
In 12 cases letters were sent to THC. Eleven of these letters requested that no survey was needed, and
THC agreed in all cases. One letter was also sent to the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department because of a linear transmission line project that crossed Corps and TPWD
properties on O. H. Ivie Reservoir. This project was likewise allowed to proceed. These projects are all
summarized in Part 3 of this report.
Artifact collections and associated records from three projects were curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin. These were from the Double Horn Resource Area (Project 3.09),
the Pedernales River Nature Park (Project 8.09), and the Cedar Point brush control project (Project
19.09). No collections were made for the remainder of the projects, and no curation is necessary for
them.

Introduction
From January 1 through December 31, 2009, the Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA)
Archaeology Services staff conducted file searches, field reconnaissance, intensive survey-level cultural
resource investigations, and archaeological monitoring for 69 projects within the LCRA’s 11-county
statutory district and broader 42-county service area (Figure 1). Additional electrical transmission-related
projects were also conducted outside of LCRA’s traditional service area. These cultural resource
investigations were conducted by LCRA Archaeology Services staff members Daniel J. Prikryl and
Andrew F. Malof with the aid of contracted archaeologists Charles A. Hixson, Glenn T. Goode, and Pat
Hatten under the authorization of Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5141. Mr. Prikryl, Mr. Malof and
Mr. Hixson were the Principal Investigators under this permit.
The LCRA’s 2009 Annual Report, the nineteenth in a series of yearly reports submitted to the Archeology
Division (AD) at the Texas Historical Commission (THC), summarizes in-house investigations that
include records checks, reconnaissance, intensive surveys, and monitoring of projects that are each 300
acres or less and are located on LCRA’s lands and easements. Investigations for projects of more than
300 acres or involving test excavations or full-scale mitigative excavations are conducted under
authorization of separate Texas Antiquities Permits either by in-house staff or consultants and are not
reported in this document.

Environmental Background
Introduction
From its headwaters on the Llano Estacado near Lamesa, Texas, the Colorado River flows 864 river miles
to its mouth at Matagorda Bay, a watershed that for millennia has been the major source of water for
Central Texas and portions of the Coastal Plain (Figure 2). It has provided prehistoric and historic Native
Americans as well as historic pioneers with the resources necessary to sustain life. The effects of
environmental change on the river and its resources have a concomitant impact on the people who are
dependent on those resources. Subsequent change can be reflected in the settlement patterns or in the
tools prehistoric people used to process the various food resources. Research of the landscape and
cultural evolution along the river is a goal of the LCRA. The information in some areas is more abundant
than in others, the result of differential research. This section provides a brief physiographic background
for the Colorado River within the 11-county LCRA statutory district from San Saba County in the Llano
Uplift Region to Matagorda County on the Gulf Coastal Plain (Figure 1). Subsequent sections focus on
the ancient and modern people who depended on the river for sustenance.
Physiography and Geology
The Colorado River flows in a generally southeasterly direction crosscutting bands of geologic deposits
generally oriented on northeast-southwest lines. Along its course through the LCRA statutory district, it
crosscuts three major physiographic zones: the Llano Uplift, the Hill Country, and the Gulf Coastal Plain
(Sellards et al. 1932: Figures 3 and 4).
The Llano Uplift. As the Colorado River enters San Saba County at the northwest boundary of the LCRA
statutory district, it intersects Paleozoic Era formations of sandstone, limestone and shale of
Pennsylvanian and Misissippian ages (Arbingast et al. 1976:11). Beginning about midway in the county
and into Burnet and Llano counties, the river traverses billion-year-old Precambrian Era igneous and
metamorphic formations of the Llano Uplift region (Fisher 1981). Granite, schist, and gneiss are a few of
the rocks observed in the region. The Llano Uplift region has very rugged topography with elevations
that range from 1,500 ft above mean sea level (MSL) to 825 ft MSL along the river. High points are
Packsaddle Mountain, Backbone Ridge, Long Mountain, and the Riley Mountains. Black (1989:7)
observed that Packsaddle schist and granite were used by prehistoric aboriginal groups in Central Texas.
Grave offerings made from the schist were reported at a cemetery site downstream on the coastal plain in
Austin County along the Brazos River (Hall 1981). Granite cobbles from the river were favored for use as
grinding stones (Johnson 1991) and observed by the authors at sites in the Hill Country and at the
Kingsland Site (41BT215). Gravels deposited during Pleistocene floods cover earlier deposits in some
areas along ancient flood terraces. The gravels provided prehistoric people with cobble chert and
quartzite for stone tools.
The Edwards Plateau/Hill Country. Continuing its meandering course, the river traverses Cretaceous
limestone deposits in Burnet and Travis counties (Fisher 1974 and 1981). The area is classified as the
Hill Country, a subprovince of the Edwards Plateau (Woodruff 1975:4). Woodruff (1975:4) describes the
area as “.... an area of high relief, steep slopes, and high stream dissection that occurs between the
Balcones Escarpment on the east and the contiguous Edwards Plateau farther west”. Elevations do not
change radically from the preceding reaches. The formations can contain nodular and tabular chert. The
prized chert of the Edwards Limestone formation provided highly workable raw material for the
manufacture of prehistoric chipped stone tools. In addition, the gravels deposited during Pleistocene
floods that mantle earlier deposits in some areas along ancient flood terraces provided prehistoric people
with cobble chert and quartzite for stone tools. The Balcones Escarpment marks the southern boundary of
the Edwards Plateau and the southeastern boundary of the Hill Country.

From this point, the limestone dips southeast and under younger sandstones. From the edge of the
escarpment, the river continues its course onto the geologically younger Gulf Coastal Plain. Given the
resistant nature of the geologic formations in the Hill Country and Llano Uplift regions, it is probable that
the river entrenched early in time, forming steep-sided, narrow canyons in some areas (Looney and Baker
1977:323). This is not the case along the lower channel on the Coastal Plain where the river has
frequently meandered and rechanneled in the less resistant formations.
The Gulf Coastal Plain. The Blackland Prairie represents the first surface unit traversed by the river at the
interior end of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Situated at the base of the Balcones Escarpment, the Blackland
Prairie is a northeast-southwest trending geographic province (Arbingast et al. 1976:12). The Blackland
Prairie has relatively flat topography and its surface geology consists of Cretaceous-aged clay and marl.
As the river continues through Bastrop, Fayette, and Colorado counties, it has incised a channel into
Eocene and Miocene age sandstones and clays, leaving behind ancient floodplain terraces (see Caran et
al. 1992). Radiocarbon dating of a volcanic ash zone in one of the older upper floodplain terraces near
the town of Smithville in Bastrop County indicates terrace development prior to the 620,000 BP (before
present) date (Caran et al. 1992:3-4). The ash is a Middle Pleistocene windblown deposit from volcanoes
in the Yellowstone area. The uplands are hilly in places with gentle slopes. Elevations range from 500 ft
MSL in the uplands to 350 ft MSL along the river banks. Gravel deposits along the river in Bastrop and
Fayette counties are millions of years old. The earlier gravels (i.e., deposited during the late Tertiary
Period) were deposited by large ancient river courses transporting gravels in the channel from as far away
as the Rockies. Now these same erosion-resistant gravels mantle river basin and tributary divides.
Referred to in some areas as Uvalde Gravels (Byrd 1971), they provided prehistoric man with a source of
usable chert and quartzite for chipped stone tools.
The outer bands of the Gulf Coastal Plain in Colorado, Wharton and Matagorda counties are composed of
relatively flat clayey Pleistocene surfaces of the Beaumont Formation and other fluviatile terraces. Relief
is minimal with elevations ranging from 10-40 ft MSL in the uplands to 5-10 ft MSL on the flats near the
river channel. Gravel deposits are scarce. Prehistorically, this resulted in an adaptation to other types of
material for tools such as shell and bone. On the outer plain where the Pleistocene Beaumont clays
predominate, a high incidence of megafauna remains ( e.g., mammoth, camel, mastodon, bison, sloth) has
been observed and specimens collected from the clays at places such as the mouth of the Sabine River
(Long 1997). Paleoindian artifacts dating to 12,000 years ago have been found on the nearby beach
(Long 1977).
Soils
Except along the Colorado River floodplain where aggrading alluvium has formed terraces, soils along
the river uplands bespeak the underlying strata or parent material. Numerous Soil Conservation Service
soil series describe the consistency of the various soil groups.
In the Llano Uplift area, upland soils can be formed from decomposing granitic and decomposed organic
material (e.g., leaves, bark, berries, cedar duff). The sandy granitic soils contain particles of mica, quartz
and schists (constituents of the granite). At 41BT215 (The Kingsland Site), some of the sandy granitic
soils have been redeposited down slope by runoff (colluvial redeposition). Near the base of the slope
where the soils have been redeposited, the river has flooded and deposited sediments. The combination
has left alternating bands of alluvial and colluvial deposits.
In the limestone country of the Hill Country, the soils are deep to shallow, and predominantly consist of
stony calcareous clays and clay loams that formed from parent limestone, marl, and organic humic
deposits. In some places where erosion has exposed limestone bedrock, the soils are pocketed on

5

erosional benches. Since these clay and clay loam soils are non-acidic, bone and charcoal are better
preserved in archeological deposits.
On the Gulf Coastal Plain, topsoils are variable and mimic the underlying geologic formations. Beginning
with the Blackland Prairie on the interior edge of the Gulf Coastal Plain, clay and clay loam topsoils are
derived from the underlying limestone, marl, and clay surface geologic formations. Downstream from the
Blackland Prairie, sandy to fine sandy loams occur in areas underlain by various Eocene and Miocene
sandstone bedrock formations. Further southeastward, clay loam and clay topsoils are found adjacent to
the Gulf of Mexico in the Coast Prairies of Wharton and Matagorda counties.
Vegetation
Changes in the vegetation along the Colorado River correspond with changes in soils and bedrock
geology. McMahan et al. (1984) describe the various vegetal classifications. The descriptions presented
by the authors include dominant as well as understory species. To more fully understand the
classifications, two physiognomic classes need definition:
1. Parks - Woody plants mostly equal to or greater than 9 ft tall, generally dominant and growing in
clusters, or as scattered individuals within continuous grass or forbes (11 to 70 percent woody canopy
cover overall).
2. Woods - Woody plants mostly 9 to 30 ft tall with closed crowns or nearly so (71 to 100 percent canopy
cover); midstory usually lacking (McMahan et al. 1984:2).
The Llano Uplift Region is characterized by Live Oak - Mesquite Parks, where overstory species include
post oak, blackjack oak, cedar elm, and black hickory. Understory species include buffalo grass, curly
mesquite, little bluestem and Texas winter grass. These species mainly grow in granitic soils.
In the Hill Country the vegetation ranges from Live Oak - Ashe Juniper Parks to Live Oak - Mesquite Ashe Juniper Parks, where overstory species include live oak, Texas oak, shin oak, and cedar elm with
under story species such as agarito, flameleaf sumac, Texas pricklypear, little bluestem, Texas winter
grass, and curly mesquite. These species are mainly found on level to gently rolling uplands and ridge
tops.
Along the edge of the Balcones Escarpment the vegetation is referred to as Live Oak - Ashe Juniper
Woods. Overstory species are the same as in the preceding categories, with some different understory
species such as evergreen sumac, twistleaf yucca, and escarpment cherry. Species are mainly found in
shallow limestone soils in the hills and escarpment.
On the coastal plain, the original vegetation of the Blackland Prairie was bunch and short grasses
(Arbingast et al. 1976:13) with narrow riparian zones restricted to the flanks of stream channels. Much of
the Blackland Prairie was placed into crop production during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a
result only occasional remnants of the original prairie grasslands have survived. East of the Blackland
Prairie, a Post Oak Woods/Forest with Grassland mosaic is found in the Post Oak Savannah. Overstory in
these areas is post oak, blackjack oak, eastern red cedar, mesquite, black hickory, cedar elm, and
hackberry. Understory species include little bluestem, silver bluestem, dewberry, and yaupon.
Anomalous to the area are stands of loblolly pine mixed with post oak in Bastrop County. Along the
coastal prairies in Wharton and Matagorda counties, the original vegetation consisted of coarse and coarse
bunch grasses and marsh and salt grasses. The development of croplands in the historic period has altered
the vegetation regime in many parts of this region.

Archaeological Background
Introduction
The portion of the LCRA’s 11-county statutory district from its upstream end in San Saba County down
into central Bastrop County falls within a region defined as the Central Texas Culture Area during
prehistoric times (Prewitt 1981). Downstream eastward from the vicinity of Bastrop, Texas to Wharton,
Texas, prehistoric remains show influences from both Central and Coastal Texas during certain
prehistoric periods (Skelton 1977). At least one attempt to define an East-Central Texas prehistoric
culture area within the Post Oak Savannah region has been made (Goode 1984). However, aside from the
fact that burned rock midden sites are restricted to the Hill Country area, prehistoric archeological
materials from the Paleoindian and Archaic periods in East-Central Texas and along the coastal portions
of the Colorado River drainage are generally similar to those found in Central Texas Culture Area. For
this reason, the prehistoric Culture History Section that follows heavily utilizes the well-established
Central Texas chronology. In the Late Prehistoric section, however, the cultural remains along the coast
are discussed separately from those inland since a distinctive Late Prehistoric cultural tradition is evident
on the coast from the Bay City area down to the coastal shoreline (including barrier islands) beginning
approximately A. D. 1000. Last of all, the authors recognize the merits of Ellis et al’s (1995) argument
that the traditional Central Texas prehistoric cultural sequence summary typically presented in
archeological reports glosses over the wide range of environmental diversity and the full range of huntergatherer adaptations and processes. However, it is beyond the scope of this report to adequately detail the
full range of such prehistoric adaptations and cultural processes along the lower Colorado River.
Prehistoric
First evidence of human occupations in Central Texas dates to what is known as the Paleoindian period.
This period is defined as prior to 8500 years BP. The Paleoindian period has been divided into two
distinct periods (Collins 1995: 376, Table 2), with the earlier Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview cultures
present at 11,500 BP. These early people are typically thought to have subsisted on varieties of big game,
the Clovis on mammoth and extinct forms of bison, the Folsom and Plainview on bison. New evidence is
suggesting that this view is in error, and that these people utilized the big game when necessary or
advantageous, but subsisted on a substantial percentage of smaller game as well (Collins 1995:381). This
early Paleoindian period was followed by a Late Paleoindian period, which has subsumed portions of
Prewitt’s Early Archaic. For example, the Golondrina style point, placed in the Early Archaic by Prewitt,
has been placed in the late Paleoindian period by Collins (1995:376) based on distinctive features such as
edge grinding and size. Lifeways, however, seem to indicate a more archaic lifestyle (Collins 1995:382).
This has been termed a transitional period, with Paleoindian strategies slowly giving way to broaderbased pursuits of the relatively more sedentary hunter-gatherers of the Archaic (Johnson 1989:52).
The entire Central Texas Archaic spans some 7500 years, from ca. 8500 BP to around 1250 BP. It can be
characterized generally as a time of increasing human populations adapting within a fluctuating but
generally warming climate. Following Collins (1995) the Early Archaic begins around 8500 BP, and lasts
until 6000 BP. The Middle Archaic follows and lasts until around 4000 BP, followed by the Late Archaic
I to 2500 BP, and the Late Archaic II, to about 1200 BP. The Late Prehistoric, or as Johnson now refers
to it, the Post Archaic, follows, and here the phases mentioned earlier seem to hold fairly well, with
Austin phase peoples around until about 800 BP when a seemingly true cultural horizon (Johnson 1994),
the Toyah phase, began.
Foraging cultures are immediately dependent upon natural resources for subsistence. It follows that much
information about lifeways can be gathered if ecological conditions can be ascertained. Collins et al.
(1993) and Johnson (1995) have both examined lines of evidence to suggest warming and cooling trends,
7

and these are both through the proxy of moisture, as temperature is very difficult to determine. Collins et
al. depend heavily on pollen analysis, which provides information on plant regimes from which climatic
data can be extrapolated. Johnson utilizes various lines of data, including pollen and microfauna from
buried contexts at Halls Cave, and also dated evidence of aggradation or lack thereof of stream side
terraces, with the assumption being that surfaces aggrade (or deflate) during wetter times, but remain
stable during drier times. Their interpretations agree very closely for the Middle and Late Archaic, but
are in direct opposition during much of the Early Archaic. Collins is also somewhat more conservative,
avoiding some of the fine-grained peaks and valleys seen in Johnson’s reconstruction (Collins 1995:Table
2, Johnson 1995:Figure 35).
The Early Archaic was a time when persons were having to adapt to the widespread extinction of the
large animals that had existed during the preceding Paleoindian period. Although the big game hunting
nomadic lifeway has been shown to be largely a stereotype, mobility was probably high and populations
relatively low (Collins 1995:381, Johnson 1989). This basic way of life extended into the first part of the
Early Archaic. Dart points are described as Early Split Stem, and include the Gower type first defined at
the Youngsport Site (Shafer 1963). Johnson has determined the period was relatively moist (Johnson
1995:Figure 35), while Collins shows it as fairly dry (Collins 1995:Table 2). Both indicate that the
beginning and end of the period were opposite what they showed for the majority, i.e., a peak of either
dryness or wetness at about the middle of the period. Evidence suggests that there were no bison during
this time (Collins 1995:383).
The question of bison presence or absence is very significant for understanding human behavior. Bison,
and to a lesser degree antelope, prefer open grasslands and prairies, and are also social animals, traveling
in large herds. The habits of these large-bodied mammals can be contrasted with the largely solitary
habits of woodland-preferring deer. In most cases bison would be considered to have high return rates,
tempered to some extent by high processing costs. The results would be evident in scheduling, mobility,
and technology of prehistoric people. In general, bison could be expected in tall grass prairies as opposed
to, for instance, oak savannas. Increases in available moisture favors tall grass over short grass, but also
can result in replacement of grasslands by woods. Johnson suggests that bison favored dry conditions in
Central Texas (Johnson 1995:86). Collins indicates bison were present in both wet and dry conditions,
and it is difficult to derive any patterns from his projected data (Collins 1995:Table 2). The strongest
correlation is between moisture-loving microfauna at Halls Cave and a long period of bison presence
through the Late Archaic. At other times bison are seen when all other indicators are of dry conditions.
Perhaps the best explanation comes from Ellis et al.’s (1995) discussion of environmental diversity.
Differential change on a micro- or meso-scale favored bison presence or absence on a scale too fine
grained to be reasonably compared with broader climatic shifts.
The Middle Archaic shows climatic conditions of Collins and Johnson coming into fairly close alignment.
Both agree that there was an initial period of fairly mesic conditions followed by a period of drying.
Johnson sees a relatively mild and slow-paced change, while Collins sees an almost catastrophic drought.
Regardless, it is at this time that rock features, designed in the Early Archaic for efficient control of fireproduced heat, expand in function and complexity, coinciding with a spread of xerophytes from the west
due to drying conditions, and resulting in the burned rock middens that begin to be seen (or at least are
more common) during the end of the Middle Archaic (Collins 1995:384, Prewitt 1991:26).
Projectiles in the first part of this period are thin, broad-bladed Bell/Andice/Calf Creek types, deeply
notched points that are believed to have been used both for hunting based on impact breaks, and as
knives, as seen in microwear analysis. This is consistent with a specialized hunting economy, and the
apparent bison presence at that time would be an obvious target of a multipurpose projectile/knife
(Collins 1995:384). The disappearance of bison coincides with the replacement of these types with
narrow, thick, heavy Travis and Nolan points. Johnson sees precursors of the bison tool assemblage
8

coming in from the Plains, and precursors of these latter points perhaps from the Lower Pecos, in the form
of Pandale points (Johnson 1995:88). This is suggestive, as the Plains would of course have had bison,
while they were largely absent in the Lower Pecos. Perhaps the new style was more efficient for the
newly high-ranked deer, which would surely have replaced bison as the preferred meat source. Toolkits
in general became more diverse, as diet breadth widened and generalization became necessary in order to
effectively intensify the use and processing of lower ranked food sources (Prewitt 1981:73).
The Late Archaic, as noted earlier, is divided into subperiods I and II. The first portion saw a
continuation of the dry period initiated earlier, and burned rock midden accumulations peaked at this
time. The Bulverde point, although in some respects similar in form to Travis/Nolan points, is seen, at
least by Johnson, to be a distinct technological break, and again to have apparent influences from the
northeast and Plains regions (Johnson 1995:89-90). It is this break, combined with a continuity seen in
succeeding Pedernales types as well as the extent of burned rock midden accumulations, that has resulted
in this major reordering of this portion of the Archaic.
Also appearing about this time was the Marcos-style point, another broad-bladed point with deep corner
or side notching, similar in some respects to the Pedernales, at least in width of blade. It is at this time
that Late Archaic I shifts to Late Archaic II, and the climate seems to become much moister. Apparently
bison are present throughout most of the Late Archaic, even as narrow bladed Ensor/Fairland points begin
replacing the broader Marcos/Williams/Marshalls.
One interesting way of explaining this seeming discrepancy would be by having these latter points hafted
on arrows (Tomka 1998), with an underlying (but wholly subjective) assumption that darts did not have
enough penetrating power for bison and so the emphasis was on a wide blade causing extensive
hemorrhaging. The penetration of darts was perhaps sufficient for deer if a narrower blade was used. A
narrow blade propelled by a bow, however, might have enough penetration to effectively kill a bison.
Regardless, increased moisture saw a retreat of the xerophytes, and a corresponding decrease in the
construction of burned rock middens, especially in the eastern portion of Central Texas.
There is also evidence of increasing populations, and processing of plants other than xerophytes is evident
based on an increase in numbers of groundstone from these components (Collins 1995:385). It is not
clear what was being so extensively processed with these implements. Acorns and grass seeds are two
possibilities. Cemeteries became more widespread, as does evidence of internecine warfare (Hall
1981:iii). Combined, these would suggest an attachment to land and protection of resources, and also a
certain increase in environmental stress or resource depletion. As well, Johnson sees general technologies
arriving from the plains, while social variables seem to be influenced from Woodland cultures to the east
and northeast (Johnson 1995:96, 97). In short, it seems to be a time of rapid changes in social complexity
with resource intensification and a broadening of the diet base, most likely as a response to the demands
of increasingly large human populations.
The Late Prehistoric period seems to be a continuation of Late Archaic lifeways up until Toyah times
when bison reappeared, as did a more nomadic life as well as technologies (blades and specialized
scrapers) not seen since Paleoindian times. The Late Prehistoric period has been subdivided into two
distinct intervals by Collins (1995: 385), which correspond to Prewitt’s Neo-Archaic Austin and Toyah
Phases. The early Late Prehistoric, or Austin Phase, shows a distinct trend toward arrow points, but the
Archaic lifeways seem to persist. The late Late Prehistoric corresponds to the Toyah Phase, and cultural
remains indicate a shift back towards a hunting subsistence base. Bison apparently became common once
more in Central Texas (Collins 1995:377, Table 2; Prewitt, 1981:84), and prehistoric peoples evidently
took full advantage of that resource. This period, of course, came to its conclusion shortly after the
arrival of Europeans to Texas in the early 16th century, marking the beginning of the Historic Period.

9

In the coastal region of the Colorado River drainage, Ricklis (1995) has proposed that the Late Prehistoric
extends from about AD 1000 to about AD 1700. During that era the material assemblage includes pottery
with types identified as sandy paste Goose Creek variations and Rockport Black-on-Gray variations some
with asphaltum decorations. During the historic period and quite probably during the later part of the
Late Prehistoric, Karankawan groups occupied the central coast. Archeological data suggests that the
Karankawa spent the fall and winter along the coastline in large encampments (Ricklis 1996:101).
Fishing and collection of shellfish were the principal economic pursuits at these sites. In the early spring,
and continuing through the summer, the Karankawa moved inland to smaller camps along the rivers and
creeks that empty into the coastal bays. The collection of wild plant foods and hunting of deer and bison
were important pursuits during that portion of the year.
Historic (200 BP - recent times)
Native American. The Historic Period begins at the time of European contact, ca A.D. 1500, although
along the Colorado River little direct interaction between Native Americans and Europeans occurred for
as much as 200 years after this time. Evidence of the early part of this period in terms of archaeological
materials is generally quite rare and minimal. While the descendents of the Late Prehistoric in the
vicinity of the mouth of the Colorado River appear to be the historic Karankawa (Ricklis 1995), the
cultural evolution of descendants of the Toyah Phase peoples is not well understood in the Central Texas
region. For example, Campbell (1988:73) cautiously names at least 60 historic Indian groups associated
with the Bastrop County area. Of these, only a portion could be considered native to the area. The
Tonkawa, generally believed by the public to be the single indigenous "tribe" of Central Texas, were
immigrants probably from what is now Oklahoma (Campbell 1988:75). Further westward in the Hill
Country, the Apache and Comanche were present during the Historic Period. Aggressive European
settlement across eastern and coastal Texas just into the fringes of the Hill Country destroyed most of the
native population prior to their removal to reservations.
Euro-American. In the early 1530s, Cabeza de Vaca became the first known European to transverse the
lower Colorado River (Hester 1999). Members of La Salle’s expedition and a number of early Spanish
explorers and missionaries crossed the Colorado in the late 17th century, but it was not until the early 18th
century that Europeans are known to have stayed for any length of time on the river (Baumgartner et al.
1997:17-26). In 1709, for example, the Spanish explorers of the Espinosa-Aguirre Expedition stopped
along the river in the vicinity of Wilbarger Creek between present day Austin and Bastrop, Texas
(Campbell 1983).
There are no records of any Spanish missions being constructed on the Colorado River, and actual
Spanish settlement on the Colorado River did not occur until relatively late. In 1805, Manuel Bustamante
ordered Spanish troops to be stationed at the El Camino Real crossing of the Colorado at present-day
Bastrop, Texas where a stockade was built and named Puesta del Colorado (Webb 1952, Vol. 2:120). It
was not until 1829 that permanent settlement began at Bastrop (formerly called Mina) with the arrival of
settlers associated with Stephen F. Austin’s third grant that was also known as the “Little Colony.”
Shortly before his death in 1821, Moses Austin had obtained from Spain the first land grant to introduce
American families into Texas. By the time the Congress of Mexico reaffirmed conditions of this grant to
his son, Stephen F. Austin, in 1823, settlement of the “Old Three Hundred” families on the lower Brazos
and Colorado rivers was well underway. On the Colorado River drainage, the grant allowed Anglo
settlement from the coast all the way up to the vicinity of present-day La Grange, Texas in Fayette
County.
Typical of early Anglo settlement on the Colorado River was Beason’s Crossing near the present-day
town of Columbus, Texas (Webb 1952:378). Among the early colonists at this settlement was Jesse
10

Burnam, who was able to raise enough able-bodied men in the Beason’s Crossing area in 1822 to march
down to the mouth of the Colorado to check on the robbery of a sailing vessel (Webb 1952:378).
Downstream in present-day Wharton County, twenty-five of the “Old Three Hundred” families received
title to land in that county in 1823 and 1824. Early settlement there centered around a trading post called
Preston, which was located on the east bank of the river about 10 miles south of the current town of
Wharton (Webb 1952:890). By the early 1830s, the western edge of the frontier had extended into
eastern Travis County with a chain of small family forts located at Webber’s Prairie, Coleman Branch,
and Fort Prairie (Webb 1952:796).
Numerous men from the Colorado River settlements participated in the Texas Revolution. However,
none of the major battles occurred on the Colorado River. Beason’s Crossing figured prominently,
though, in the Runaway Scrape, as many Texans crossed the Colorado at that location. After their safe
passage, Houston ordered the town of Columbus burned (Webb 1952:379).
Following the Texas Revolution, the community of Waterloo in central Travis County was selected as the
capital and renamed Austin in 1839. Settlements on the Colorado River below Austin continued to grow
as more settlers arrived in the years leading up the Civil War. In counties on the coastal plain, plantation
style agriculture was practiced by the wealthier landowners. While the majority of the settlers were
originally from the southern United States, German immigrants began entering the Biegel’s Settlement
area Fayette County area in the 1830s (Carter and Ragsdale 1976). After the Civil War, many former
plantation owners in Fayette, Colorado, and Wharton counties sold their lands in small parcels to other
German and Czech immigrants. They, along with former Black slaves, usually worked the land as tenant
farmers before accumulating enough money to purchase land. Cotton, corn, and sorghum were the staple
crops well into the mid 20th century.
Prior to the Civil War, Anglo settlement had spread up the Colorado River into through western Travis,
Burnet, and San Saba counties. Fort Croghan was established at the future townsite of Burnet in 1849
(Webb 1952:253). Among the earliest settlers in this region were a group of Mormons who operated a
mill. Noah Swithwick, a well-known early settler in Bastrop County, bought the Mormons’ mill in 1854
when he moved upstream to Burnet County. Several years later he built a new mill at a new site on the
nearby Colorado River (Smithwick 1983). Settlement along the middle Colorado was well-established by
the mid-1850s (Malof 2008).
Archival and oral historical research has been undertaken in recent years on a number of the early
communities in the present Lake Travis area in Travis and Burnet counties (Utley 1994 and 1996). In this
research, Utley (1996:9-10) notes that the Texas Hill Country lies west of the 98th meridian, Webb’s
(1931:8-9) dividing line between forested areas of the eastern United States and the Great Plains.
Following Webb’s thesis concerning how this dividing line affected the way of life of early settlers, Utley
shows how early attempts at cotton farming in the rocky soils frequently failed. As a result most settlers
adapted to ranching and other economic pursuits.
The construction of a chain of four lakes by the newly formed Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA)
in the late 1930s and early 1940s dramatically changed the landscape and the small communities along
the Colorado River in western Travis, Burnet, and Llano counties. The former emphasis on ranching has
given way to the development of lakefront subdivisions and tourism associated with the lakes.

Results of Investigations
During calendar year 2009, the LCRA’s Archeology Services staff conducted in-house cultural resource
investigations for 69 projects. As shown on Figures 3, 4 and 5, 48 of these projects were located in the
Edwards Plateau/Hill County Region and areas westward, while 21 were situated on the Gulf Coastal
Plain. Table 1 provides a listing of the project names, project numbers, Interim Report (IR) numbers,
dates of investigations and THC concurrence (when applicable) and the construction status of each
project. This table also gives data on archeological sites that were recorded or revisited during each
project, the State Archeological Landmark (SAL) status of each archeological site, the amount of acreage
involved in each project area, and the county in which each project is situated.
Figures 3, 4 and 5, along with Table 1 show that the vast majority of construction-related projects were
located in Travis and Burnet counties, continuing the trend of LCRA construction projects west of Austin.
Much of this activity is related to development of parks and preserves along the Highland Lakes. In
contrast to 2008, transmission line activity was more prevalent west of Austin. These transmission line
maintenance and construction projects are a reflection of Transmission Services Corporation’s priorities,
and in part are a response to the Public Utility Commission (PUC) mandated Competitive Renewal
Energy Zones (CREZ) projects.

Part 1. Full Reports of Survey Investigations
Results of 11 interim reports (IRs) detailing cultural resource investigations for projects that ranged
mostly from 2 to 300 acres in size and/or resulted in the assessment of cultural resource sites are
presented in this section. An overall size exception occurred along the 310-acre Pitsburg to Mason
transmission line (Project 36.09), although actual survey acreage was about 126 acres. The 810-acre
Double Horn survey was included as agreed upon by THC and LCRA, and allowed under the terms of the
Annual Permit. The Archeology Division (AD) at the Texas Historical Commission (THC) has
previously reviewed 10 of these 11 reports, and, in each case, concurred with the assessments and
recommendations presented by the LCRA Archeology Services staff. The Double Horn report is a
summary of several years of investigations, is not project-driven, and was not submitted previously as
there was no need for review and concurrence.

Introduction
The LCRA’s Double Horn Resource Area (DHRA) is a 810 acre wildlife preserve located on the south
shore of Lake Travis in the southern part of Burnet County. It contains some of the most extensive and
significant prehistoric archaeological resources of any of the LCRA’s properties on the lake. Judging
from the large horizontal sizes of many of the prehistoric terrace sites, aboriginal people made intensive
use of the area, drawn to the reliable water in the spring-fed creek and the abundant aquatic and riverine
food resources. Similar environmental conditions beneficial to aboriginal settlement exist at other LCRA
tracts, however at Double Horn the record of human use for the last 5,000 or more years has been
preserved in unusually deep alluvial sediments. Furthermore, the upper portions of these sediments have
remained above the full pool elevation of the lake and thus have escaped long-term inundation that is
known to damage archaeological deposits (Lenihan et al. 1981, Will and Clark 1996, Malof 1998).
Cultural deposits in alluvial landforms are potentially more significant than those in surface or nearsurface contexts because of better preservation due to rapid burial and because their arrangement in
stratified layers provides a chronological sequence of data pertaining to human behaviors spanning
thousands of years.
Objectives
The purposed of this report is to describe the known archeological sites located within the boundaries of
the DHRA, assess their research potential, and develop management priorities. The data used here were
collected during inventory surveys that were conducted since the early 1990s and augmented by
information obtained from surveys done for LCRA construction and brush clearing projects within the
DHRA. Artifacts collected during these surveys have been curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory.
The survey methodology varied between surveys and is described in more detail in the following sections.
Typically it consisted of a pedestrian survey with subsurface testing of aggrading landforms. Shovel
testing was used during most of the inventory surveys and a mechanical auger attached to skid steer was
used during several brush clearing projects on floodplains. The maximum depth reached by both methods
was about the same – 120 cm – but the mechanical auger dug holes more quickly resulting in more tests
for a given area and reached depths of 100 cm plus more consistently, even in hard, clayey soils.

Prehistoric Background - A Region of Hunter-Gatherers
Over 50 years of archaeological investigations in central Texas have led to a general understanding of the
region’s chronology and prehistoric subsistence patterns (Collins 1995). Much of the region’s
chronology was derived from excavations of deeply stratified terrace sites similar to those found at the
mouth of Double Horn Creek. From at least 11,500 radiocarbon years ago up until the Spanish period
(circa AD 1700), the Edwards Plateau and much of the rest of Central Texas were inhabited solely by
hunter-gatherers. Even in the Late Prehistoric period (AD 700 – 1650) when native groups in other parts
of what is now Texas were making the transition to an agriculture-based economy, the Central Texas
groups continued to rely completely on wild resources. Much of the archaeological record relates to
subsistence activities, the presence of burned rocks from cooking facilities being a notable example. At
certain locations, burned rock fragments have accumulated to the point of forming low topographic
features that are known as burned rock middens, or locally as “Indian mounds.”
Texas has traditionally been divided into a number of different archaeological regions, each defined by a
set of shared cultural traits such as projectile point forms. Many archaeologists today interpret huntergatherer cultures in terms of their adaptation to the natural environment, and one criticism of
33

archaeological regions is that they often encompass more than one environmental zone and so contain
more than one type of adaptation (Ellis et al. 1995). For example, the Central Texas Archaeological
Region as defined by Prewitt (1981) includes six natural regions, including the Edwards Plateau where
the Double Horn Resource Area is located.
One cultural trait that is characteristic of the Edwards Plateau, especially the eastern portion, is the
immense size of burned rock middens, some covering several acres. Burned rock middens are found in
other natural regions of the state but the large size of those on the Plateau is unique and suggests a level of
intensity and duration not seen elsewhere.
Historic Background – Double Horn, a Wilderness Community
The lower Double Horn Creek area was first settled by people of Old World descent in the mid 1850s.
Jesse Burnham (or Burnam), one of the original 300 of Stephen F. Austin’s Colony, and Levi Fowler are
credited with founding what became known as the Double Horn community. Both men were born in
Tennessee, and like other pioneers who were raised in Appalachian areas of the Upper South, were
attracted to the hilly region of what was then thought of as western Texas. Noah Smithwick (Figure 6),
another early pioneer, provides an explanation for the name of the creek in his memoirs The Evolution of
a State:
Double Horn, the name of a little creek which emptied into the Colorado from
the west, was derived from the interlocked antlers of two bucks found near the
source of the stream by early settlers. The bucks, presumably having met at the
spring to drink, became engaged in a dispute, and in attempting to fight it out got
their horns interlaced, and, being unable to extricate themselves, starved to death
(Smithwick 1994:239).
Burnham built his home at a spring that still bears his name and is the main source of Gridiron Creek that
flows into Double Horn Creek immediately west of the Double Horn tract. Levi Fowler’s land grant
fronted the Colorado River and overlaps the southeastern portion of the Double Horn Resource Area.
Smithwick, who lived across the river from the Fowler homestead, gives a favorable impression of the
early community:
The Double Horn people were all in comfortable circumstances and had an
excellent school, presided over by Professor W. H. Holland, a Yale graduate. The
holdings of the different families were large; their houses thus being widely
separated, the children had to go from two to three miles to school (Smithwick
1994:239).
The school that Smithwick refers to was located on the Colorado River about a mile and a half upstream
from the mouth of Double Horn Creek. It was called the Francis Chapel School honoring a benefactor
and because the building was also used for church services. Students playfully named the school “Frog
Pond Academy” due to its proximity to the river.

34

Figure 6. Noah Smithwick

For the first two decades, the Double Horn community remained as Smithwick described it, a dispersed
settlement composed mainly of isolated farmsteads. For many years even the post office was housed in
the home of whoever was currently appointed postmaster, the first being the schoolmaster Holland. The
earliest businesses, a cotton gin and grist mill, were built sometime in the 1860s or early 1870s on
Gridiron Creek. As of yet, no archaeological remains from this early period have been positively
identified within the DHRA; however archival and architectural investigation at the house at 41BT260 –
sometimes referred to as the Lewis/Flinn Homesite after the most recent owners - suggest that portions of
this structure could date as early as the 1850s (Foster 1993).
Americans still moved unmolested through the area in large family groups. H. C. Fowler, nephew of Levi
Fowler, wrote the following about an excursion out from Marble Falls:
On January 12, 1853 our wagon train composed of Josiah Fowler and wife and
eight children and Dr. P. M. Yett and Wife and children arrived in Double Horn.
No wagon had ever been within five miles of where we camped. But we were not
without neighbors – a short two miles away was a camp of some fifty Indians and
they had plenty of bear meat, deer, etc., together with a wagon load of acorns
piled up (Debo 1979).
In the mid to late 1870s, some centralization of the community occurred when several businesses were
established in the area around the mouth of Gridiron Creek. First the cotton gin and grist mill on Gridiron
Creek were moved downstream to its junction with Double Horn Creek and soon after a general store was
built nearby by Zachariah Chunn and Robert Rust. A blacksmith shop was also established immediately
east of the cotton gin.
In 1871, T. L. Denniston bought 1,247 acres of land that deed records show included the area now
designated as 41BT260. It is uncertain if any members of the Denniston family ever lived in the house at
41BT260 since another standing house lies only 800 feet to the southeast. This second house, a two-story
frame structure with board and batten siding has not been dated and is now considered part of a separate
archaeological site, 41BT36. An undated photo (Figure 7) probably taken around the turn of the century

35

shows the Denniston family in front of the 41BT36 house, hence it is now referred to as the Denniston
Homesite.
The Dennistons probably raised cotton for cash and grew subsistence crops such as corn for home
consumption and animal feed. Peanuts may also have been grown in the sandy soils that cover the upland
margin, as was done in the 1940s in fields immediately north of the 41BT260 house.

Figure 7. Denniston family outside standing in front of 41BT36 house, c. 1900.

The population of the Double Horn community peaked at 50 in the mid 1880s and then declined by half
by 1896 (Frasier and Tilloson 2010). This figure probably refers to the core area near the mouth of
Gridiron Creek and not to the Double Horn area as envisioned by most folks at the time. The general
store closed in 1891 and was then used to house the Double Horn School until 1895 when the old “Frog
Pond” schoolhouse was transported by mules along the Old Double Horn Road to its new location on the
north side of Double Horn Creek opposite and east of the mouth of Gridiron Creek. This location would
seem to place it within or close to the western boundary of the LCRA property. Perhaps the historic
scatter recorded at 41BT411 is associated with the school site. The Double Horn Post Office closed in
1911 but the cotton gin and grist mill continued in operation for eight more years. Double Horn as a
recognized community ceased to exist soon after although the school was in use until 1941 when it was
moved to another location upstream and soon after consolidated into the Marble Falls School District.
Physiography and Landforms
Physiography, the study of physical geography, provides landform data that aids in assessing the locations
and distributions of various types of natural and cultural resources. In the broad sense, the DHRA is
located within the Edwards Plateau Section of the Great Plains physiographic province (Carr 1969:3). In
the general area around the Double Horn Recreation Area, land surfaces consist mostly of plains with
high hills (Hammond 1964:Map 4). The recreation area is situated immediately west of the original
Colorado River channel and includes acreage both north and south of the point at which Double Horn
Creek, a major spring-fed tributary, empties into the west bank of the river. Four other minor stream
channels also run through the Double Horn Recreation Area. Two of these empty into the lower reaches
of Double Horn Creek while a third, which is located at the far east end of the tract, enters directly into
the river channel. The fourth stream channel is a more ephemeral drainage that is situated at the far
northwest end of the recreation area.
36

Terrain within the DHRA is moderately variable. Geologic fault lines which have created steep cliffs in
two areas, while outcrops of one of the geologic formations, the Marble Falls Limestone, contains
hundreds of fracture lines that create deep crevices across broad stretches of the ground surface in the
western and far southern ends of the tract. In contrast, massive 30 to 40 foot-thick deposits of Holoceneaged alluvium that are present in the eastern one-third of the tract form a relatively flat terrace that has
relief only where stream channels have dissected it.
This report uses a three part division of the landform zones at the DHRA for a more detailed discussion.
These three zones are the lowland/floodplain, the upland margin, and the upland (Figure 8).
Lowland/Floodplain Zone
The lowland/floodplain zone extends from the top of the original banks of the Colorado River and lower
reaches of Double Horn Creek at an elevation of about 656 feet mean sea level (ft msl) up to a height of
714 ft msl. This zone is a 30 to 40 foot thick massive block of alluvium that forms a flat terrace that
covers the eastern one-third of the DHRA This alluvium is Holocene in age, and similar alluvium
deposited further upstream on the Colorado River is thought to have been deposited in the last 10,000
years (Blum and Lintz 1993). The alluvium appears to primarily consist of silty loam sediments that have
been deposited mostly by overbank flooding of the Colorado River. A smaller percentage of the sediment
load is carried by Double Horn Creek from upstream areas. From the confluence of Double Horn Creek
and the river, this alluvial wedge extends westward across all of the tract on the north side of the creek for
a distance of about 2,000 feet and across a substantial portion of the land south of the creek for a length of
3,000 feet.
No intensive geomorphic investigations that would provide a detailed history of the alluvial terrace
sequence on the Colorado River in the Lake Travis area have been undertaken. However, data from the
limited test excavations conducted by the LCRA Archeology Services staff at site 41BT37 in 2001 did
suggest that the upper 6 feet of the alluvial terrace in the immediate area of the excavations formed within
the last 5,000 to 5,500 years (Prikryl et. al 2004). It is unknown if this is representative of the age of the
deposits of the larger terrace area.
Much further up the Colorado River near San Angelo, intensive geomorphic investigations led to the
hypothesis that two Holocene valley fills exist on the Colorado and Concho Rivers in that area (Blum and
Lintz 1993). The earlier was defined as an Early to Middle Holocene Fill or Qal-2, which dated from
10,000 to 5,000 years ago. Following an approximately 500 year hiatus, deposition of the second valley
fill, called the Late Holocene Fill or Qal-1, is thought by Blum and Lintz (1993:313) to have commenced
around 4,500 years ago and continued until around 1,050 years ago.
Archaeological survey of the Double Horn tract indicates that numerous buried prehistoric archaeological
sites are present within the alluvial terrace that forms the lowland/floodplain zone. Aside from the high
archaeological potential of this zone, further study of the terrace depositional sequence could produce
data for hypotheses on climatic fluctuations within the last 10,000 years.

38

Upland Margin Zone
The upland margin zone is defined as generally extending from 714 to 800 ft msl at Double Horn.
Topography within upland margin zone on the north side of Double Horn Creek is generally gently
sloping to flat. On the south side of the creek, the upland margin terrain is more variable with the steeply
sloping terrain that forms the east valley wall of a small tributary of Double Horn Creek being
noteworthy. Within the valley margin zone, topsoils are shallow to nonexistent with numerous exposures
of limestone and sandstone bedrock evident in many areas. Furthermore, in areas where the Marble Falls
Limestone outcrops on ground surface, literally hundreds of deep crevices that occur between limestone
blocks create jagged surfaces that are very difficult to traverse.
Upland Zone
Topographically, the upland zone extends from 800 ft msl upward. The only upland area within the
recreation area is situated at the far south end of the tract. There, the crevices associated with the
outcrops of the Marble Falls Limestone are also common. In other areas, shallow topsoils occur on gently
sloping terrain.

Summary of Previous Investigations
Portions of the Double Horn tract have been surveyed for cultural resources at various times over the last
60 years. Archaeological sites that have been recorded within the Double Horn tract are shown on Figure
9. Until the 1990s, all surveys relied on surface inspection alone to locate archaeological sites. Notably,
recent surveys have also relied on subsurface testing, mostly in the form of shovel tests that can reach a
depth of up to 120 centimeters (four feet) under the most favorable conditions. Detection of
archaeological components is made difficult by the fact that large areas at the mouth of Double Horn
Creek are covered by culturally sterile alluvial sediments that could well exceed the depth of shovel
testing. Some archaeological deposits are obviously deep since artifacts can be seen protruding from the
cut bank along both sides of the creek. This is most evident on the north side embankment near the
confluence with the Colorado River where careful profiling by archaeologists have revealed cultural
material as deep as 4.3 meters (14 feet) beneath the ground surface.
At least two sites near the mouth of Double Horn Creek were recorded in the late 1930s by Arthur
Woolsey during an archaeological survey of the Basin of Marshall Ford sponsored by the Anthropology
Department of the University of Texas. These sites were later given the Smithsonian trinomials of
41BT40 and 41BT41 but their locations were imprecisely or inaccurately described in the original survey
reports and subsequently misplotted on the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) USGS
topographic maps. Two other of Woolsey’s sites were also given trinomials (41BT36 and 41BT37) and
plotted by TARL within the Double Horn Resource Area, but from Woolsey’s original descriptions they
must lie outside the property. Woolsey’s sites were recently released from the two trinomials by TARL.
Preston Millican, an avocational archaeologist, surveyed portions of the Double Horn tract in 1973 and
recorded two new prehistoric sites, 41BT100 and 41BT101 at the southeast corner of the property. He
also revisited the areas then considered as belonging to 41BT37 and 41BT40 (both now located within
Area B of 41BT36), and 41BT41 in an area now divided between 41BT170 and the eastern part of
41BT169.

39

Figure 9. Section of the Smithwick, Texas 7.5’ USGS map showing recorded archaeological sites within the LCRA
Double Horn Resource Area. Each site number should be preceded by “41BT”.

In 1981, Prewitt and Associates surveyed parts of the Double Horn tract for an LCRA brush-clearing
project, and established the final locations for the four trinomials formerly associated with Woolsey sites.
Four new sites were also recorded on the south side of the creek (41BT169, 41BT170, 41BT171, and
41BT172), all prehistoric except for 41BT169 which contains a late 19th or early 20th century homestead.
40

Beginning in the mid 1990s, more intensive investigations of the Double Horn cultural resources were
undertaken by LCRA archaeologists. Shovel testing was carried out at 41BT170 in 1996, and at 41BT36
in 1996, 1997, and 1999 during LCRA-sponsored Nightengale Archaeological Center Teacher
Workshops. In the winter of 1999/2000, LCRA archeologists intensively surveyed most land on the north
side of Double Horn Creek. Four new sites were located, including 41BT342 which contains a pristine
(i.e., undamaged by looting) burned rock midden. The north side investigations culminated in 2001 with
the excavation a two-by-two meter unit into the terrace deposit at 41BT37 about 270 meters upstream
from the creek’s mouth, which is discussed below (Prikryl et al. 2004).
Between 2004 and 2006, inventory surveys were carried out on the south side, during which the
boundaries of several sites previously recorded by Prewitt and Associates were expanded and in one case
(41BT172) constricted a bit. Five new sites were also recorded, most of these relatively small and most
located in the upland margin topographic zone. Over half the resource area south of the creek is covered
by outcrops of Marble Falls limestone, the surface of which is deeply fissured and covered by a dense
thicket of stunted cedar and oak. These outcrops would appear to have a nearly zero potential for
archaeological sites although some of the fissures could theoretically shelter human burials. Burials have
been found in similar situations elsewhere on the Edwards Plateau. Figure 10 shows the location of
Double Horn on the central Colorado River.
Site Descriptions
As of the Fall of 2009, 23 archaeological sites (as summarized in the following table (Table 2) have been
recorded within the Double Horn Resource Area with approximately 85 percent of the property surveyed
for cultural resources, excluding those areas covered by large expanses of bare rock outcrop. Twenty-two
of these sites possess prehistoric components, five have both prehistoric and historic components, and one
site, 41BT411, has a single historic trash scatter that might relate to the second location of the Double
Horn School.
Site Typology
In this report prehistoric sites are divided into types based on artifacts found within them, to some extent
following precedent established by Kotter (1981). These four site types are lithic scatter, lithic
procurement, mixed use, and open camp. A lithic scatter consists of lithic materials including flakes,
cores, informal tools, and formal tools. Such sites will have more later-stage reduction flakes (secondary
and tertiary), than lithic procurement sites. Lithic procurement sites are more limited, but also more
specialized, representing a specific activity. These consist of lithic cores, tested cobbles, and a high ratio
of primary as opposed to secondary, and especially tertiary flakes. These are also dependent on the land
form, as they are always found within existing naturally occurring gravel deposits. A mixed use site will
contain any number of lithic materials, and evidence of food consumption or processing in the form of
food remains (mussel shell or bone), or implements (grinding stones). An open camp contains burned
rock, either scattered or in the form of hearths or larger features. An open camp will of course also have a
variety of other materials.
Historic sites in the Double Horn Resource Area are divided into two groups: those with evidence of
houses are typed as homesteads and those with Historic-era trash without nearby structures are typed as
dumps.

41BT36
Site 41BT36, as currently defined, covers an extensive area on the north side of Double Horn Creek
between 700 and 1400 meters upstream from its mouth (Figure 11). The site extends for a distance of 300
meters inland, encompassing lowland/floodplain along the creek and upland margins. For management
purposes, the site has been divided into three areas – A, B, and C. These areas are based primarily on
differential landforms, and to a lesser degree, perceived components.
The archaeological site trinomial 41BT36 was first used for a prehistoric site that was discovered by A.
M. Woolsey in 1939. He described it as having two burned rock middens adjacent to a spring. Woolsey
also stated that the site was located on the Proffitt Place. Although Woolsey’s locational data places the
site outside the Double Horn Resource Area, it was later plotted by TARL within the Double Horn tract.
By coincidence, a different site is present at that location, and it was first investigated by Kotter (1981),
who documented one historic and two prehistoric components during a survey for a proposed LCRA
brush clearing project. Kotter’s description of a terrace site towards the east and a lithic scatter towards
the west, along with a central possible historic house location is consistent with what is now considered
Area A of 41BT36.

42

LCRA field investigations at the site began in 1996 when the annual Teachers’ Workshop conducted
testing activities at the Denniston House, which is now included in Area B. The 1997 Teachers’
Workshop was likewise conducted at that location. Also in 1996 the Llano Uplift Archeological Society
conducted a field trip which included portions of Area A. In 1998 LUAS activities included
reconnaissance of Area C, resulting in recognition of that previously unknown portion of the site. The
1999 Teachers’ Workshop conducted testing activities in Area A.
Most-recent work has been conducted by LCRA Staff as part of ongoing inventory projects along the
Highland Lakes. It was this work that resulted in additional testing and consolidation of previous
investigations resulting in the present configuration of the site into three distinct areas. A total of 56
shovel tests indicates continuity of materials between areas. A metric grid designed to encompass the
entire northern portion of the Double Horn tract was established in 1997. Summer Teacher Workshop
shovel tests were tied to this grid, as were those from 1999 (the 1998 Workshop was held elsewhere).
During 1999/2000 inventory activities the original datum was relocated and corrected GPS coordinates
were gathered. A number of shovel test and feature/artifact coordinates were also collected by GPS
during this phase of the project. These data were entered into ArcView and projected along with
associated map data. The original datum (N860/E2000) became the anchor for a virtual grid which
allowed all shovel tests to be given coordinates and entered into a common data base. Conversion
problems with newer versions of ArcGIS have made much of this information irretrievable at the present
time (2009), although hard copies are still within LCRA files.

The following discussion will synthesize findings from the three areas, beginning with Area A.
Area A consists of the originally recorded (1981) portion of the site. An additional historic component
was added to it. It consists of the long interfluve separating Double Horn Creek from an unnamed
tributary entering from the north (Figure 12). Elevations range from around 670 to around 720 msl. The
majority of the site has been subject to intermittent inundation, otherwise disturbances seem minimal.
Vegetation varies from oak and pecan parks on the lower, eastern elevations to juniper woods on the
upper, western slopes. This corresponds with a decrease in soil depth and increase in pebbles, gravels,
and cobbles following the same trend. The dimensions of Area A are 285 m E/W by 80 m N/S. Seven
shovel tests were excavated here, all during the 1999 Teachers’ Workshop.

Figure 12. Area A interfluve looking north with Double Horn Creek in foreground.

The eastern terrace section (A-1) received four shovel tests which found material to a depth of 60 cm.
One shovel test on the lower easternmost section was negative. No prehistoric temporal or functional
diagnostics were found. One drill on an Archaic (Late?) dart point base was found in the north central
portion of Area A in 1997, but was left for future recording, and has not been relocated. The historic
component reported by Kotter (A-3) is located at the west central portion of the terrace. It consists of
scattered sandstone foundation stones on a mounded area and a few associated glass and ceramic
fragments. One shovel test in this location recovered similar material and at least one cut nail. The other
historic component (A-4) consists of a bottle stopper, white stoneware, pink glass, flat glass, dressed
limestone pieces and cedar posts, or piers. It is located in the northwestern portion of the area along the
dirt road and adjacent to a steep drop to the north.

45

The final discrete prehistoric component (A-2) is located in the westernmost section of the area, on the
end of a relatively high ridge overlooking Double Horn Creek to the south. The vegetation here changes
from the parks of the lower terrace to the more wooded environment reminiscent of an upland setting,
although the actual elevation difference is minimal. An arrow point was found in this portion, but was
left for future recording, and has not been relocated. It was probably a Scallorn. Another Scallorn was
recovered at a later date. There is also a large number of grinding stones, both granite manos and
sandstone metates in this area. Three shovel tests were excavated, two of which indicated dense
accumulations of lithic material between 0 and 20 cm. Silty loams extended to approximately 40 cm
before grading to clays.
Summary
Area A appears to contain two distinct functional, if not temporal, prehistoric components based on
differences in land forms and types/distributions of artifacts. Area A-1 may contain deeply buried
deposits and intact features. It should receive additional testing if threatened. Area A-2, although shallow
and possibly deflated, may also be a long stable surface, and as such has potential for containing intact
deposits. This portion of the site likewise would require additional testing and possible mitigative action
if threatened. The two historic components, Area A-2 and A-3 are valuable largely for locational data and
verification of possible future archival work. Detailed location maps, in particular of A-3 should also be
produced. Otherwise, no additional work or avoidance is deemed necessary at those two locations,
although both maintain limited interpretive value.

Area B
Area B can be considered the site center. It is located north of Double Horn Creek on a landform which
rises rapidly towards the north before leveling out at the upper slopes. Much of this area has been grazed
and farmed, in particular the northern section. Vegetation is largely scattered mesquite and juniper with
some oak over grasses and forbs. Disturbances include clearing, plowing, and grazing. The dimensions
are 290 m N/S x 200 m E/W. Thirty-two shovel tests have been excavated in this area. This portion of
the site is divided into two sub areas, Area B-1 and B-2. Area B-1 is largely an historic component
consisting of the Denniston House and associated materials and outbuildings. Area B-2 is largely
prehistoric, and lies upslope to the north of the Denniston House.
The Denniston House is a two-story board-and-batten structure constructed of apparent cypress that was
probably locally milled (see Figure 7). It is near the end of a local road seen on a 1936 map, but which
was once part of a more extensive system of roads linking the local communities. These are more
obvious on an 1890s era map. Nearby communities were Double Horn, Cypress Mills, and Rockvale, as
well as Smithwick and Pleasant Valley across the river. Noah Smithwick sent his children across the
river to the Double Horn School, which he felt was superior. Denniston arrived in the mid-1800s. In
1872 he donated land for the Rockvale church and school. He was married to Francis and had four
children: Lloyd, Robert, Nolan, and Ruth. Although the house is still standing, it is in an advanced state
of disrepair. A chimney that shows signs of rebuilding episodes stands on the east wall. The main
entrance was likewise on the east. The interior received mid-twentieth century remodeling and was likely
a hunting camp. A front porch seen on an early photo has been enclosed. Original stairs still lead up to
the upper loft, or bedroom. Numerous cut nails were used in construction of the original building, and
repairs and probable re-siding took place later, as evidenced by wire nails. A substantial cattle pen and
stone loading ramp is 90 ft to the west. The remains of a stone wall and fence are directly south, and a
probable barn location is to the east.
Shovel tests were excavated during the 1996 and 1997 Teachers’ Workshops. Ceramics, glass and metal
and household materials consistent with turn-of-the-century occupations and later were recovered, as well
as prehistoric lithic material. Materials near the house were as deep as 40 cm. Those excavated
46

downslope near the pen and outbuilding location were largely negative. The outbuilding is visible on
1970s aerials of the area, but is now absent. Although there is widespread historic material seen
downslope from the house, it apparently is being redeposited. Prehistoric material seems largely surficial
as well, although a shovel test in the pen area recovered light prehistoric material between 50 and 70 cm
and again between 90 and 120 cm in sandy loams. The outbuilding area exhibited extensive charcoal,
indicating the structure burned. The only diagnostic prehistoric artifact known to be recovered from this
area is a naturally drilled Pectinadae sp. marine bivalve shell found eroding out of the bank adjacent to
Double Horn Creek. Although the possibility remains it may be historic in origin, its context is more
suggestive of prehistoric origins. It takes on additional significance after recognizing the recovery of a
San Patrice point in Area C.
Area B-2 received a total of 19 shovel tests beginning with the 1996 and 1997 Teachers’ Workshop. The
1999 Teachers’ Workshop helped define the southeastern portion of this area, and inventory activities of
1999/2000 more fully defined the northern portion of the site. The main portion of this area is in a field
directly east and to the north of the Denniston House. Soils are largely sandy loams over clays which
support scattered juniper and mesquite. This main section is probably what was described as 41BT40.
The plot for 41BT40 does not coincide with the physical description of the site, while the sketch map is
almost a perfect fit for the field in question, as is the site description, including the fence and gate. Site
41BT40 was left as plotted, with a revisit form indicating it was not relocated and should probably be
considered part of 41BT36. If the house labeled as “Foss” on Woolsey’s map can be linked to the
Denniston House then the above will be confirmed. Until then, it remains the most succinct explanation.
Shovel tests indicate flakes are concentrated between the surface and 20 cm, with soils grading either to
high calcium carbonate or clay content below 4050 cm. One of two shovel tests at the southeast of this
area suggests substantial buried materials between 20 and 30 cm. Shovel tests indicate a decrease in
material to the west and north. Surface indicators are flakes, mussel shell, and a relatively large number
of grinding stones. Various diagnostics recovered or noted at different times are a Montell, a Pedernales,
a drill on a Castroville, an Archaic point, and an unspecified gouge.
Summary
The Denniston House was occupied and presumably built by one of Burnet County’s earliest settlers. Its
simple construction and possibly unique design contain potential for furthering an understanding of
vernacular architecture in Central Texas. Denniston’s contributions to the Double Horn area include the
donation of a large tract of land which helped establish Rockvale as a community in its own right. The
location of his house in close proximity to the Flinn house strengthens the associations of both within the
larger community. It should be noted that the house has been modified through its history, and by 2009
had reached an irretrievable state of decay.
The prehistoric component in Area B seems to be largely represented by Late Archaic materials. The
prehistoric aspects are largely surficial or shallowly buried. Should the central location of the component
be threatened additional testing and detailed surface mapping are warranted. Also, if the area downslope
of the pen becomes threatened additional testing should be undertaken to determine if substantial deeply
buried materials are present.

Area C
Area C exhibits the greatest environmental, and perhaps concomitantly, cultural diversity of the three
portions of the site. This area is approximately 425 m E/W by 285 m N/S. The northeastern quadrant is
largely open grassy field with small stands of oak, mesquite, and hackberry. This is designated Area C-1.
Eight shovel tests were excavated on an E/W transect across this area, a continuation of a transect from
the 1997 teacher’s workshop in Area B. Recovery was light to none, with one or two flakes found in
various levels between 20 and 80 cm in sandy loams. The variation in depth of recovery seems to
47

indicate mixing of a light deposit of cultural material. Area C-1, therefore, serves largely to indicate
continuity in artifacts across the larger site.
The northwest quadrant is designated Area C-2. It is located at the edge of the upland field system and
adjacent to a series of limestone rock outcrops that bench to the south. Small oaks and elms along with
juniper become quite dense along these slopes. The limestone outcrops are horizontal slabs at the
juncture of the upland and the slope. Amongst these slabs are numerous pocketed areas of very small
chipping debris, often seen upon the limestone itself. At least one mano was found, as well as a Travis
dart point. Many of the slabs have round, conical impressions, some with concentric striations. Others
have deep indentions, sometimes within larger shallow basins (Figure 13). These were tentatively
interpreted as mortars although Dan Potter of the Texas Historical Commission felt they were not. If they
are, it would be unusual both for their geographic location to the east of most documented mortars, and
for their physiographic location in an upland setting relatively far removed from water. There is a
possibility that the heavily dissected limestone may once have held a spring, but there was no direct
evidence of this. The large numbers of flakes seen pocketed within the limestone suggests periodic burial
and exposure. The Travis point was found directly upon a limestone slab, although it may have been
placed there by recent human agency.

Figure 13. Concavities in outcrop in Area C-2 of 41BT36.

Four shovel tests were excavated in this area. Two centrally located tests recovered high densities of
mostly interior flakes, primarily between 0 and 40 cm, although deposits were indicated as deep as 60 cm.
Soils were of sandy loams over reddish clays at around 50 cm.

48

At the northeast corner of Area C-2 is a stone enclosure probably used as an animal pen (Figure 14). It
consists of a wall two to three feet high built of dry-laid limestone slabs encircling an area of
approximately 200 ft2. No artifacts were found in association with this feature.

Figure 14. Stone pen in Area C of 41BT36.

Area C-3 is located along the south and east edge of the limestone benches extending south from Area C2. Soils are deep (100 cm +) sandy loams and clays, but in areas are gullied and eroded. One shovel test
recovered numerous flakes from varying depths, up to 40 cm. Others found lesser amounts of mostly
interior flakes between 0 and 30 cm. Also noted were several concentrations of burned limestone, at least
two of which seemed to exhibit internal structure and could be considered hearths (Figure 15). Several
granite manos were observed as well as a few probable sandstone metate fragments.
Collected and observed diagnostic artifacts are quite varied. A San Patrice point, a reworked expandingstem probable Early Archaic point, a drill on a Late Archaic base, and two flake tools similar to Toyah or
perhaps historic materials (Prikryl, pers comm) have been seen. Several thin bifaces have been noted, as
well as the medial section of an arrow point and a gouge-like implement. The San Patrice is notable not
only for its Paleoindian connotations but for regional implications as well, especially when considered
along with the marine shell found in Area B.
Area C-4 has been transected but not tested. It extends along a south trending drainage from the upper
field area down to the creek bank. Soils here are potentially deep, as at Area C-3, but vegetation is very
dense, consisting primarily of juniper with little to no understory. The mid-slope portion may be deflated
to red clays, but testing is needed.

49

Figure 15. Burned limestone rock clusters in Area C-3 of 41BT36.

Prehistoric materials seemed to be primarily either upslope or downslope, although there were exceptions.
Upslope prehistoric material consisted of 3-4 manos, at least two sandstone metate fragments, one of
which was double sided and pecked, possible burned rock, thin bifaces, thick bifaces, and a proximal
section of a probable dart point exhibiting ground lateral edges. Downslope was found a Darl and a Late
Archaic (Pedernales?) dart point. Historic materials were found mostly upslope and included a cut nail,
purple glass, brown glass, stonewares, a plowshare, and limestone features, one a somewhat circular
arrangement of cut limestone along with a barrel hoop, and a low wall accompanying an old fenceline at a
mid-slope clearing. These materials may be associated with 41BT260, the Flinn House, but based on the
removed distance and indications of housewares and possible foundation remains it may be the remnants
of another as-yet unknown residence.
Summary
Area C has produced the greatest number and diversity of diagnostic artifacts. Area C is divided into four
distinct subareas. Subarea C-1 consists of sparse buried lithics in probable disturbed contexts. No
avoidance or further work is felt to be necessary here. Area C-2 contains a number of possible/probable
mortars and evidence of intensive tool maintenance activities. There may be intact activity areas here.
Detailed mapping and surface collection is warranted if this area is threatened. Area C-3 seems to be
largely eroded, but may well contain intact features or activity areas. Additional work may be warranted
dependent upon the scope of any proposed impacts. This work may include additional testing, detailed
surface mapping, and limited excavations. Area C-4 is most like an extension of Area C-3. Additional
testing will be required to positively link the two areas. The historic component contains potential to shed
further light on early settlement along Double Horn Creek.
Site Summary
41BT36 is a very large and very diverse site that has been formally designated as a SAL. The prehistoric
components are extensive and rich, and areas of the site have high potential for producing additional local
and regional information regarding past lifeways and subsistence patterns across a broad expanse of time.
The potential significance increases when combined with other Double Horn sites: 41BT37, 41BT170,
50

41BT171, 41BT336, and 41BT342. The spring-fed Double Horn Creek may well have provided resources
enabling long term and repeated residency of the area. Further understanding of these sites will provide
valuable data for a greater understanding of settlement in the Colorado River basin.
Historic period features consist of two artifact scatters in Area A where houses or outbuildings may have
once been located, and the Denniston homestead in Area B where the deteriorated house and surrounding
artifact scatter are present. The Denniston homestead is an important resource because it is a part of the
dispersed, rural Double Horn community, which in turn was a significant contributing member in the
early settlement of southern Burnet County.
41BT37
Site 4BT37 is located on the left bank of Double Horn Creek on a terrace at the junction of the Colorado
River (Figure 16). The site was visited by Kotter (1981) during an investigation for a proposed brush
clearing project, and was thought at the time to be the same as A. M. Woolsey’s Site No. 60 (51 B85)
recorded during the Marshal Ford Basin Survey in 1939. It was later determined Site No. 60 could not
possibly be located where 41BT37 is plotted, so after discussion with Carolyn Spock in the records
department at TARL, it was determined that she would remove the link between Site No. 60 and 41BT37,
thus making Kotter’s visit the first official episode of site recording.
Kotter described the site as a 20-30 cm thick zone of cultural material seen in the cutbank of the creek,
with the top of deposits located approximately 40 cm below ground surface. Burned rock and mussel
shell were the primary artifactual remains. Recommendations were for testing if the site was to be
impacted.
During the 1999/2000 season Kotter’s 1981 observations were confirmed, and a series of 26 shovel tests
were excavated in order to determine the nature and extent of deposits (Figure 16). In addition, two
profiles were cleaned and sampled from the exposed cutbank, which, when combined with adjacent
shovel tests, indicated cultural material could be present to a depth of 430 cm below the present terrace
surface in some areas of the site.
Initial testing was concentrated at the previously mapped location of the site, which coincided with a lens
of cultural material seen in the cutbank approximately 1 m below the surface. Due to abnormally low
lake levels, it was also possible to test portions of the site normally submerged by Lake Travis. Sixteen of
the 26 shovel tests and one profile were excavated in this area. These 16 shovel tests were typically
terminated at 100 cm below ground surface without reaching the bottom of cultural deposits. Recovered
artifacts consisted primarily of burned rock, lithic debitage, and mussel shell.
The low lake level also allowed detailed examination of the entire creek cutbank, and cultural material
was noted for much of its length, either in place within the bank or with collapsed or slumped terrace fill.
As testing progressed to the south and west it became obvious that the site’s boundary extended far
beyond the originally mapped boundaries. A total of 10 additional shovel tests were ultimately excavated
to establish the southern and western boundaries of the site. It was determined that the site extended for a
length of approximately 630 meters from the confluence of the creek and the river channel southwestward
to the edge of the channel of one of Double Horn Creek’s tributaries (see Figure 8).
The site matrix, a silty loam, was such that shovel tests were excavated easily to a depth of 100-120 cm
during field work at 41BT37. When it was noted that material was still being recovered from those
depths, a hand auger was employed that allowed a 7 cm diameter sample to be removed 20 cm at a time,
which allowed tests to be extended for up to an additional 2 m.

Shovel Test 18, which was located near the center of the site, was a 45-cm diameter unit excavated by
shovel to a depth of 100 cm and then augered to a final depth 280 cm below the surface. Recovery
increased between 140 and 200 cm below the surface, and included the stem of a Nolan or Travis style
projectile point from between 160 and 180 cm. Additional material from this zone included lithic
debitage consisting primarily of tertiary chips and flakes, including biface thinning flakes. Material was
found as deep as 260 cm in this unit. The profiling of the adjacent cut bank suggested that cultural
materials could continue downward to an overall depth of 430 cm below ground surface. Overall, the
high artifact counts and the great depth of cultural deposits in the vicinity of Shovel Test #18 led to the
selection of that area for the test excavations.
In 2001, LCRA Archaeology Services staff utilized grant funding from the Texas Historical
Commission’s Texas Preservation Trust Fund to excavate a two-by-two meter unit to a depth of two
meters in the area adjacent to Shovel Test #18. The test excavations showed an unbroken sequence of
cultural material from the surface to a depth of two meters that included diagnostic artifacts from the
Toyah Phase, Late Archaic I and II periods, and the latter half of the Middle Archaic period. The
excavations showed that bioturbation of the sediments by tree roots and burrowing animals compromised
the integrity of the upper meter of deposits, but a Late Archaic I (circa 1200 BC) activity zone with large
amounts of burned rock, chipping debris, mussels, and snails, and diagnostic Pedernales and Kinney
projectile points was identified between 100 and 130 cm below the surface (Prikryl et al. 2004). A second
intact occupation zone dating to the late Middle Archaic (circa 2500 BC) was uncovered at approximately
170 cm below the surface.
Following the completion of the test excavation report on 41BT37, a shovel test was excavated into the
bottom of the still-open test excavation unit before it was backfilled. The shovel test sampled the deposits
between two and three meters below ground surface. Artifacts consisting of chert debitage, burned rocks,
mussels, and snail shells were recovered in all five 20-cm levels, although slightly lower numbers than in
levels just above. Thus, the cultural deposits in this portion of the site are at least 3 meters thick. The test
pit was then backfilled.
No additional fieldwork was conducted at 41BT37 until 2006, when the LCRA Archaeology Services
staff established the north boundary of the site during a field project related to proposed brush clearing by
the LCRA Conservation Staff (Hixson 2006). This investigation indicates that the site is quite narrow in
comparison to its length with the average width being just 35 meters.

41BT40
Preston Millican’s map drawn in 1973 places 41BT40 a short distance northeast of the “Foss house”
apparently what is now called by LCRA archeologists the Denniston house after the original owners.
This location conforms to the physical description by Woolsey of the site he recorded north of Double
Horn Creek in 1939 and later (1960s?) given the trinomial of 41BT40 by TARL. Somehow the site was
plotted 400 to 500 meters to the northeast in the floodplain area where no archeological site has been
found despite repeated efforts by LCRA archeologists. Even though the area that Millican visited was
correctly identified as 41BT40, it has since been placed within the limits of 41BT36 by LCRA
archeologists and the 41BT40 trinomial no longer used.

53

41BT41
In the late 1930s, A. M. Woolsey recorded three separate areas of prehistoric cultural material along the
south side of the lower reaches of Double Horn Creek. They were collectively given the site designation
of Site No. 64 (Marshall Ford-64) and also referred to as the Koch site apparently after the owner or the
family who lived in the house at the west end. Two of these artifact areas he located east of a gulley and
the third on the west side between a house and barn. From his descriptions, Woolsey appears to be
referring to the gulley that borders the west side of 41BT41, so therefore two of his artifact areas belong
to the western part of that site as now plotted. The third of Woolsey’s artifact areas appears to belong to
the eastern part of 41BT170 (as now plotted), and although the house and barn are no longer in evidence,
a structure is shown at that location on the 1900-01 USGS topographic map. To confuse matters further,
Woolsey could possibly be referring to the house and outbuilding whose foundations are still present at
41BT169 which would mean that the so-called gully is actually the unnamed creek. With this
interpretation, Woolsey’s two easterly artifact areas are part of 41BT170 and his westerly one is part of
41BT169. However, most of the evidence seems to point to Woolsey’s MF-64 artifact areas as belonging
to sites now designated as 41BT41 and 41BT170.
P.W. Millican visited what he thought was 41BT41 in 1973. From the location described in his survey
form, he was apparently at a site on the east side of a smaller creek – the unnamed creek -emptying into
Double Horn 2500 feet upstream from its mouth at the Colorado River. Site 41BT170 was recorded at
that location in 1981 by archeologists from Prewitt & Associates. This area is now considered to be only
the northwestern part of a much more extensive site, 41BT170. The large gully separates the present
locations of 41BT41 and 41BT170. Before the gulley was eroded out by Double Horn Creek, probably in
relatively recent times, the site areas now designated as 41BT41 and 41BT170 were connected.
As presently defined, 41BT41 is located on a terrace along the south side of Double Horn Creek 200 to
600 meters upstream from its confluence with the Colorado River (Figure 17). Prehistoric cultural
material was found inland 100 to 150 meters beyond the terrace edge fronting the creek, giving a total site
area of 12 acres (Figure 18). On the west side of the site the wide, deep gulley has cut into the floodplain
from the creek, forming an inlet when filled by the waters of Lake Travis. The terrace was cultivated up
until the 1930s but has since been overgrown by mesquite thickets. Large pecan trees grow on the slope
between the creek and the terrace edge. Several smaller gullies have eroded from the creek into the slope
but little if any cultural material is seen in the walls of the cutbanks. One biface fragment, one core,
moderate amounts of chert debitage, moderate amounts of burned rock, and moderate amounts of mussel
shell were recovered during shovel testing down to a depth of 120 cm. Artifact density varies
considerably across the site area and five out of the 12 shovel tests had no recovery. A granite mano and
scattered burned rocks in low densities were noted on the surface.
The research value of 41BT41 was once thought to be potentially high since it contains buried deposits.
However through additional shovel testing and monitoring in February, 2008 for an LCRA brush clearing
project, it was determined that site 41BT41 has very limited research potential (Malof 2008). During that
investigation an additional series of shovel tests was excavated, for a total of 31 shovel tests defining the
site’s boundaries. Ten of these tests were positive for cultural materials, which were consistently small
amounts of chipping debris and occasional small burned rock and mussel shell fragments. The only
obvious tools were two biface fragments. Some groundstone (three or four manos, some sandstone
metate fragments) were visible on the ground surface, especially towards the west end of the site.
Examination of significant erosional gullies fronting Double Horn Creek over different occasions has
never resulted in locating any significant cultural materials at depths. In fact, these cuts are remarkably
devoid of artifacts.

54

It seems unlikely that this high terrace, so similar to that which holds 41BT37, directly across the creek,
would have received so little attention prehistorically. The working hypothesis is that a combination of
flood events over the past few hundred or more years has significantly altered the southern terrace,
washing away any accumulated cultural debris. Alternatively, there may be very deeply buried deposits,
but they are not visible at depths approachable by conventional means and the deep erosional gullies do
not lend support to the concept. Site 41BT41 is assessed as not eligible for formal listing as a State
Archeological Landmark.

Figure 17. Site 41BT41 on wooded terrace, looking downstream (east) on Double Horn Creek

41BT100
This site is located on the east side of a small, unnamed creek which enters the Colorado River/Lake
Travis 1600 feet downstream from the mouth of Double Horn Creek (Figure 19). The site area includes
two small alluvial terraces adjacent to the lake and extends inland up to and along the west side of an
extensive outcropping of Marble Falls Limestone. A low rocky drainage or wash separates this site from
41BT389, which lies immediately to the east.
The site was first recorded by Preston Millican in 1973, who described it as an open camp without burned
rock middens but with evidence of hearths. He collected a possible Tortugas point and several
nondiagnostic artifacts while noting the presence of a large number of manos. The site area that Millican
recorded included what is now considered the western part of 41BT389. LCRA archeologists visited the
site briefly in December of 1999, noting recent looting (digging) into the cutbank facing the lake. Inland
areas of the site were not investigated at the time due to uncertainty about LCRA’s property boundaries.
LCRA archeologists shovel tested the site during several visits in 2005, redefining its boundaries and
getting a better understanding of sites deposits (Figure 20). Although no artifacts were visible on the
surface of the lower terraces and only a few burned rocks and mussel shell were visible in the cutbank
facing the lake, shovel testing on this landform recovered a substantial amount of cultural material.
Debitage, scattered burned rocks, and mussel shell were found below 40 cm down to the bottom of the
tests, usually 100 or 120 cm below the surface. Six bone-tempered potsherds were found between 40 and
100 cm and one Late Archaic point resembling a Fairland was found between 100 and 120 cm. The point
could well be intrusive since three potsherds were recovered immediately above it, or there is an

unconformity in the stratigraphy. In any case, nearly all the cultural deposits in the terrace reachable by
shovel testing probably date to the Toyah phase.
Higher, more eroded alluvial terraces covered with cedar lie immediately inland. What looks like an old
road cut can be seen in this area, perhaps from when the existing dirt road made a more southerly turn to
the west. No bona fide artifacts were recovered from a shovel test placed in this area.
North of the alluvial formations lies a massive outcrop of Marble Falls limestone, extending inland in a
south southwesterly direction and marking the beginning of the upland margins. Along the east side of
this outcrop – which at this point is nearly flush with the ground, are relatively deep soils containing
substantial amounts of prehistoric cultural material. In the one shovel test placed in this area, large
amounts of debitage and mussel shell were recovered from the surface down to the bottom of the test at
100 cm. A layer of burned rocks was encountered at 30 cm, in all probability a hearth. Fragments of two
projectile points, both probably Late Archaic, were recovered from the upper 20 cm of soil and a Nolan
point was recovered from between 60 and 80 cm below surface. Digging arbitrarily stopped at 100 cm
below surface without reaching the end of the cultural deposits. The depth of the soil on this elevated
rocky landform is surprising. It appears to have accumulated slowly over several thousand years both
from colluvium washing down from upslope and alluvium from major flood events.

Figure 20. Site 41BT100

41BT101
This prehistoric site is situated below a rocky cliff on the southeast boundary of the DHRA (Figure 21).
A spring vent which emerges at the base of the cliff has been dammed with earth to form a small pond.
The site was first described by Preston Millican, who noted the presence of groundstone artifacts and
chert flakes.

58

Figure 21. Map of Site 41BT101

The site was relocated in 2005 by LCRA’s Archaeology Services staff during inventory work in the
southern part of the Double Horn tract. A few burned rock fragments and chert flakes were seen on the
surface within an area measuring about 70 meters in diameter. Two shovel tests were negative. In 2008,
LCRA archaeologists again visited the site during a reconnaissance survey for a proposed boundary fence
construction project. Areas where the spring emits from the escarpment were assessed as particularly
sensitive since the limits of this site have not been established. Possible burned rock was seen on the
surface in the thicket south of the springhead.
Site 41BT101 has potential for being designated a State Archeological Landmark. Additional shovel
testing is still needed to determine if any intact, buried deposits are present at this site. The channel flows
westwards for approximately 200 meters before entering a dry, incised tributary creek of the Colorado
River. The area along the channel is covered by dense vegetation and is yet to be intensively surveyed.

59

41BT169
This extensive multi-component site with both prehistoric and historic features covers roughly a 30 acre
triangular-shaped area bounded by Double Horn Creek on the north and an unnamed tributary on the east
and southeast (Figure 22). The unnamed tributary is located 800 meters west of the confluence of Double
Horn Creek and the Colorado River and represents the principal drainage on the south side of the Double
Horn tract. Site 41BT169 extends from the wooded banks of Double Horn Creek with deep alluvial soils
(Figure 23) to the juniper and mesquite scrub uplandmargin. The west and southwest sides of the site are
bordered by large expanses of deeply fissured limestone.
Woolsey included the northeastern part of this site within a site he designated No. 64 during the Marshall
Ford survey in 1939. His Site No. 64 also included areas immediately downstream now designated as
41BT170. Millican visited the site in the 1970s, at which time it was designated as 41BT41 (see 41BT41
discussion, above). Prewitt and Associates archeologists recorded both historic and prehistoric
components in the area and designated them 41BT169 and 41BT171, respectively (Kotter 1981). They
used the 41BT41 designation for another area with prehistoric cultural material downstream from
41BT170.
The known features at this site include one burned rock midden discovered during the 2004 survey by a
shovel test 80 meters south of Double Horn Creek. The midden is completely buried in alluvium and/or
colluvium and is at least 55 cm thick and covers a minimum area of 12 by 14 meters. Another possible
buried burned rock midden was noted during Kotter’s (1981) survey in the cutbank of the unnamed
stream that borders the east side of the site. A possible third burned rock midden is indicated by a layer
of burned rock exposed in the cut bank of a shallow inlet of Double Horn Creek near the western border
of the Double Horn Preserve. This feature could be the bed of a hearth or oven without surrounding
midden deposits. Finally, a possible fourth burned rock midden may be indicated by a scatter of burned
rock on an alluvial surface south of the homestead area.
In addition to these buried features, three distinct scatters of burned rock seen during the 2004 and 2005
surveys in the central upland area are probably disrupted hearths. The largest and best preserved is a 4
meter wide circular scatter of burned limestone rocks up to 30 cm across located in the juniper thicket
near the southern edge of the site close to the limestone outcrop. Nearby, a small untyped projectile point
was found. At the extreme southern end of the site is a washed-out area where the bedrock is exposed
along with numerous cobbles probably from old terrace deposits. Cores and cortical flakes indicate that
this area was used for procuring chert.
A group of late 19th and early 20th century features designated as Area A, that includes two rectangular
groupings of rough limestone blocks (Figure 24), a collapsed root cellar, and a water well are located on
Double Horn Creek at the northeast end of the site. As stated above, these were originally recorded as
41BT171. The larger group of stones probably represents the foundation of a farmhouse, perhaps the one
shown at that location on the 1900-01 USGS topographic map. A group of standing structures is located
200 meters to the southwest in Area B, consisting of a log crib, a covered animal pen built of lumber, and
a concrete livestock dipping vat. The dipping vat was obviously built in the early 20th century, as
probably were the other two structures.
Diagnostic artifacts found during the 2004 and 2005 surveys include an Angostura point from the lithic
procurement area at the south end of the site; an Ensor point, a Darl point, and a Scallorn arrow point
from the central upland area; and one Nolan point from an eroded surface in the northwestern part of the
site near Double Horn Creek. A scraper and a thick biface were also found on the surface in the central
upland area. Chert debitage occurs on the surface in nearly all areas of the site and was recovered from
shovel tests in some cases down to a depth of 80 cm. Over a dozen manos (mostly granite) and sandstone
60

metate fragments were found on the surface in the northeastern portion of the site or recovered from the
shovel test in the burned rock midden, and burned rock was found as isolates or scattered in moderate
numbers in most areas of site.
Site 41BT169 represents an extensive prehistoric camping area with at least one burned rock midden, an
upland hearthfield, and a lithic procurement area, as well as a late 19th to early 20th century homestead and
ranch/farming complex. The prehistoric component was originally recorded as 41BT169 and was located
along the cutbank of the tributary that now forms the eastern limits of the site. The historic structures
located in the northeast corner of the site at the confluence of the creeks were originally designated as
41BT170. The survey in October of 2004 has extended the known area of both components significantly
- the prehistoric component is now known to cover at least 25 acres and the historic component now
includes a second group of structures relating to farming and ranching that is located about 170 meters
southwest of the homestead. The historic component overlaps much of the eastern and central areas of
the prehistoric component. This site needs further testing to determine the depth and extent of buried
cultural deposits close to Double Horn Creek, but with the known buried features the research potential of
this site is obviously very high. Also, periodic monitoring is needed to check on looting since it is easily
accessed by boat when the lake is near full pool. The site is assessed as eligible for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark

41BT170
This site is located on south side of Double Horn Creek immediately downstream from 41BT169 with the
unnamed intermittent creek separating the two sites. The site lies mostly within the floodplain zone with
the south end extending into the upland margins. Site 41BT170 was originally recorded in 1981 for
LCRA by Prewitt & Associates (Kotter 1981). At that time, burned rock, debitage, and metates were
noted on the surface close to the limestone outcrops upslope from the creek (Figure 25). The cultural
deposits were thought to be shallow although the possibility of buried cultural deposits was considered.

Three features have been recorded at 41BT170. At the north end of the site a buried burned rock midden
is visible in the cut bank of old channel or oxbow of Double Horn Creek. The dimensions of this buried
feature have not been determined but the burned rock stratum visible in the cut bank is approximately 30
cm thick. The presence of another possible burned rock midden or hearth is indicated by the large
amount of fire-cracked rock scattered about the looter's pits at the north base of the limestone outcrop.
The third known feature consists of an 11 by 14 meter scatter of burned rock on the surface in the
southeastern portion of the site. This last feature was found during the October 2004 survey whereas the
former two had been noted on previous informal surveys.
Deeply buried cultural deposits are present at the northwestern end the site where the unnamed creek has
cut through the alluvium deposited by Double Horn Creek. The deposits immediately above the buried
burned rock midden were tested during a 1996 LCRA Teachers Workshop, during which substantial
amounts of burned rocks and two Scallorn points were recovered. The northeastern site area along the
gulley probably contains deeply buried deposits as well. The surface in this area is lightly scattered with
burned rocks and manos, and at least one metate fragment.
The site probably once extended eastwards along Double Horn Creek to a point close to the Colorado
River before being cut in two by the gully. The cultural material on the east side of the gully is now
considered Site 41BT41. With its buried deposits and at least one burned rock midden, the Site 41BT170
is potentially eligible for designation as a State Archeological Landmark.
41BT172
The center of this extensive six-acre lithic procurement site is located in the upland margin 650 meters
south of Double Horn Creek and 150 meters west of a dry unnamed creek that is the next tributary of the
Colorado River downstream from Double Horn Creek. The site rests on the eastern slope of a low hill
that is covered by a juniper and oak woods through which a long clearing as been cut for a fence. The
surface of the slope is littered with cobbles of chert and quartz (and probably other rocks as well), perhaps
representing the remnants of a fossil terrace of the Colorado River.
Cores, tested cobbles and flakes with a large percentage of cortex are scattered in dense numbers across
entire site surface. In 1981 41BT172 was plotted as extending westwards another 200 meters, but the
present survey saw no artifacts and few cobbles in that direction, so the limits have been redrawn to
encompass an area roughly 300 by 175 meters. This site is probably not eligible for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark.
41BT260
This Historic period house site and prehistoric lithic scatter is located in the northwestern part of the
DHRA immediately north of the Area C portion of 41BT36 (see Figure 9). The site is known as the
Lewis/Flinn Homesite after the two most recent landowners. As it now stands, the house is a single-story,
wood-frame dwelling with four rooms and a central hallway. It appears to have been constructed in
stages. The dates of construction are uncertain, but the first portion and later additions all date from the
mid to late 19th century (Foster 1993). An underground cistern with an above-ground collar and a root
cellar are located behind the house to the west. A board and batten barn is located southeast of the house.
The house, surrounding features, and associated artifact scatter cover an approximately 80x80 meter area.
A light scatter of prehistoric chert chipping debris and a single dart point were also found in the yard area
of the house. These artifacts occurred both on ground surface and in the upper 40 cm of deposits in two
shovel tests. A light, but continuous scatter of other prehistoric chert chipping debris were noted to
extend about 30 meters south of the yard area to near the north boundary of site 41BT36.
64

41BT272
This prehistoric site is located on the lower slopes of an alluvial terrace fronting the Colorado River
immediately south of its confluence with Double Horn Creek (Figure 26). The alluvial terrace rises to a
height of approximately 708 to 710 ft msl (Figure 27). The buried cultural materials are located on a
narrow five to eight meter wide bench on the lower slopes of the terrace at elevations of 675 to 679 ft msl.
Thus, the zone containing prehistoric artifacts is approximately 31 to 33 ft (nine to ten meters) below the
terrace top.
The site was first discovered in 1994 by LCRA archaeologists during reconnaissance work involving the
use of a boat to examine the terrace cutbank. Limited notes indicated that cultural material was observed
sporadically along a one km length of the shoreline. The surveyors collected one Castroville point, one
Williams point, one Ensor point, one thin biface, one thick biface, one perforator, and two end scrapers.
The site was next visited during LCRA’s fieldwork at the DHRA during the drought of the years 1999
and 2000. That investigation consisted of a brief visual inspection of the northern half of the site. Very
little cultural material was seen, and it was concluded that a severe flood in 1998 had caused the collapse
and slumping of terrace deposits which had destroyed much of the site.
The drought of 1999 and 2000 ended with a large flood in late October 2000 which again inundated the
site. By 2004, lower lake levels led to another revisit of the site. At that time several hundred burned
rock fragments and pieces of chert chipping debris were exposed on the narrow terrace bench at
elevations of 675 to 679 ft msl as described above description for a length of 320 meters. Two burned
rock clusters observed within the artifact scatter had the appearance of disrupted hearths. Additionally, an
isolated burned rock feature was found near the top of the terrace cutbank at an elevation of about 9
meters above the lower terrace bench. This find led to consideration of the possibility that all of the
materials present on the lower terrace bench had fallen downslope due to erosion. Close inspection of the
cutbank exposures on the upper terrace slope failed to produce any artifacts or additional features. A
shovel test that was excavated adjacent to the burned rock feature was also sterile. It was concluded that
the feature at the terrace top was an isolated feature related to a single event occupation.
A recent revisit to the site in March 2009 again showed relatively dense cultural materials exposed on the
lower terrace bench due to drought conditions. Portions of the terrace slope appeared to have been further
eroded while other areas seemed to be covered with a layer of fine sand from flooding. A Darl dart point
was found on the terrace slope, but no features were evident.
The true nature of the cultural materials at 41BT272 is still somewhat uncertain. Diagnostic artifacts that
have been found all date to the Late Archaic II period. If the materials that are present on the terrace
bench represent a buried, intact cultural deposit, then 7 to 10 meters of sterile alluvium has been deposited
on this terrace since the Late Archaic II period. Monitoring of this site during periods of low lake levels
will continue to attempt to determine the true nature of the cultural remains at this site. Site 41BT272 is
assessed as potentially eligible for SAL designation.

Travis was low.

41BT336
This site is located at the mouth of an unnamed stream entering Double Horn from the south
approximately 350 meters west of the Colorado River (Figure 28). Flood waters from both streams have
eroded away most of the terrace that once existed in the area leaving a ridge-like narrow strip of land, part
of which becomes an island when Lake Travis is at full pool. On the north face of this silty ridge – a cut
bank facing Double Horn Creek – stratified cultural deposits are exposed. These deposits extended from
about 30 cm below surface to at least 230 cm below surface, and three burned rock features, stone tools
and bone.
Site 41BT336’s alluvial sediments may have once connected to those at 41BT170 immediately to the
south but were separated when the tributary stream changed course and cut through to Double Horn
further downstream.
Feature 1, the site’s most striking feature, is a rock-lined pit oven exposed in the cutbank facing the creek
(Figure 29). When the feature was first recorded, its northeast half had been washed away creating a
near-perfect cross-section in the perpendicular bank. It clearly shows a basin one meter wide and 25 cm
deep lined with fire-fractured limestone rocks somewhat comingled with but mostly surmounting
abundant charcoal chunks. There is a clear color and textural difference between the stratum into which
the basin was dug and that overlying it. To the left of the basin is the cross-section of what appears to be a
mound of earth resting on the same stratum into which the basin was dug. The dirt in this mound has a
slightly different color and looser texture than the surrounding sediments and is covered by a scatter of
burned rocks. Traces of another mound surmounted by rocks are evident on the right hand side as well.
Unfortunately this portion of the cutbank is not so well-preserved.
The Feature 1 profile suggests that a mound of dirt encircled the pit oven. In the hypothetical cooking
process, dirt would have been used to cover the food baking in the pit in order to seal in the heat and
moisture, both essential for successful baking (Black et. al 1997). In opening the oven to retrieve the
67

food, this dirt would have been scooped out and deposited along the outside edge of the basin, to be used
again with the next baking episode. Feature 1 is therefore a baking pit that has been used at least once
(and probably more times) to cook food. Encirclingearth mounds have not been identified during
archeological excavations of ovens in central Texas probably because they haven’t survived or, more
likely, standard feature profiles in excavations rarely extend far enough past the oven pit for them to be
visible.
All the lithic artifacts recovered from this site were found on the surface of the cutbank having previously
eroded out of the sediments. Lithic artifacts within the site’s deposits appear to be present in very low
densities. Six shovel tests were placed in the cutbank and crest of the ridge facing Double Horn Creek
during a 2000 Llano Uplift Archeological Society field trip. None of these tests recovered artifacts. In
2006, LCRA staff placed another four shovel tests on the backside of the ridge facing the tributary creek.
These also failed to recover artifacts other than a small quantity of mussel shell, charcoal, and small
burned rock fragments near the surface. The backside sediments consist of loose sand that appears to
have been deposited in recent times by the intermittent creek.
At least one of the components dates to the Toyah phase and it is possible that all artifact-bearing
sediments were deposited during this time. The only time-sensitive artifacts from this site are two Perdiz
arrow points found lying on the cutbank apron and their stratigraphic context is unclear. The charcoal
from the feature has not been radiocarbon dated. In any event, it appears that the sediments in this lowlying terrace remnant are relatively young.
The cultural deposits at 41BT336 are slowly eroding into Double Horn Creek. Each flood episode
removes sediments from the north cutbank and indentions in the bank create eddies that accelerate the
erosion. Most recent floods have almost entirely destroyed the large hearth, and as a result the site is
assessed as being potentially eligible for State Archeological Landmark designation.
41BT342
This prehistoric open campsite is located about 60 m north of the Double Horn Creek channel and about
1.9 km upstream from the confluence of Double Horn Creek and the Colorado River channel (see Figure
9). It is situated on a terrace nose at the confluence of Double Horn Creek and one of its unnamed
tributaries. The site rests about 25 ft above the normal Double Horn Creek channel.
The site is located along the west boundary of the Double Horn Resource Area and surely extends
westward onto private property (Figure 30). The portion of the site on LCRA property measures about 45
meters east-west by 37 meters north-south. Five shovel tests were excavated during the investigation of
the site. Importantly, ST #2 confirmed that a 40 to 50 cm high rise in the northern part of the site is a
burned rock midden feature. The low mound covers an area eight meters in length on an east-west line by
five meters on a north-south line (Figure 31). The first 20 cm thick level in this shovel test showed black
organic clay loam containing over 100 burned rock fragments along with about 20 chert flakes and some
mussel shells and charcoal fragments. This shovel test was terminated at the end of Level 1 so that the
midden feature would not be damaged. There are no indications that pothunters have ever dug into this
feature. The midden feature’s location on a rocky slope thickly covered by cedar and oak has no doubt
protected the midden from relic collectors. Much cultural material is visible on the surface, including
chert cores, tool fragments, debitage, ground stone mano and metate fragments, mussel shell fragments,
and many burned rock fragments.

Figure 30. Southeast edge of burned rock midden at 41BT342, looking west.

Four other shovel tests were to the north and east of the midden feature. These showed that prehistoric
artifacts are spread throughout topsoil deposits that range from 20 to 65 cm. Relatively large numbers
(n=40 to 67) of chert debitage were recovered from the first levels of STs 1, 4, and 5 north and east of the
burned rock midden. It may be that the large number of flakes in Level 1 is due to the fact that these soil
deposits represent a stable ground surface over long periods of time.
70

In conclusion, this site has one of the few totally intact surface burned rock middens known on LCRA
property on Lake Travis. Based on this fact, the site is assessed as eligible for formal designation as an
SAL.

Figure 31. Map of Site 41BT342.

41BT362
This small prehistoric site, covering approximately 0.4 acre, lies in an upland area between the forks of a
dry drainage that eventually enters Double Horn creek 700 meters to the north (Figure 32). To the south
and west lie extensive surface exposures of Marble Falls limestone covered by a dense juniper forest. The
actual site area is covered by a patchwork of juniper thickets and open areas of grass and forbs. No
obvious features were found but two small surface scatters of burned rock, one in the northeast portion
and the other in the central area of the site, may mark the locations of disrupted hearths. Chert debitage is
scattered across the entire site area but perhaps more concentrated at the south end. Chert debitage was
also found in moderate amounts down to a depth of 32 cm in the one shovel test dug at the site. A granite
mano was found at the north end of the site.
71

This site probably represents a short term camping area and is the only upland campsite recorded in the
DHRA. Artifacts are not especially numerous on the surface but moderate amounts of debitage were
recovered in the shovel test placed near the southern limits of the site. The site is not situated on an
aggrading landform, so the archeological deposits are probably shallow. Because the cultural material is
buried and there is the possibility of a narrow time frame of occupation, this site could yield important
information and is therefore potentially eligible for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. Its
location in a relatively remote area away from Double Horn Creek and the property line offers some
protection from looters.
41BT363
This site represents a small, isolated lithic procurement area located approximately 600 meters south of
the main channel of Double Horn in an open area along the eastern edge of an extensive expanse of
limestone outcrop (see Figure 9). Dense woods of mostly small juniper trees cover nearby portions of the
outcrop as well as the areas to the east. Several species of cactus grow in the area, including tasajillo,
prickly pear, and barrel cactus. An old truck path runs in a north-south direction immediately east of the
site roughly paralleling the outcrop.
Cores, tested cobbles, and flakes, mostly primary and secondary in moderate numbers are scattered along
the margins of a low rock outcrop. These artifacts are intermingled with unmodified cobbles of chert and
quartz, probably remnants of an old river terrace. No formal tools or burned rock were noticed and the
artifact count drops off quickly to the east away from the outcrop. Being in an upland area close to an
outcrop, there is little likelihood of buried deposits, so the site was not shovel tested. This site is the
smallest of several lithic procurement sites found inland on the LCRA tract south of Double Horn Creek.
It appears to have little research value other than providing locational information on prehistoric land use.
The site is not eligible for designation as a State Archeological Landmark.
41BT364
This site comprises a diffuse lithic scatter located just within the eastern boundary line of the LCRA
Double Horn Resource Area approximately 700 meters southwest of the south bank of the Colorado River
(see Figure 9). It is about 50 meters east of an unnamed dry creek which enters the Colorado River 450
meters downstream from the Double Horn confluence. The site probably extends a short distance to the
southeast onto private land, an area not investigated during the 2004 survey. The cultural material is
spread out on a low slope between the dry creek to the west and a steep escarpment to the east. A juniper
woodland covers the site. Cultural material is very sparse, consisting of about a dozen pieces of chert
debitage and some scattered pieces of possible burned rock.
Site 41BT364 represents a short-term camp or more likely a lithic scatter possibly associated with the
prehistoric quarry site 41BT172, which lies only 200 meters to the west on the other side of the drainage.
The site could be disturbed since a large cow bone was recovered at a depth of 20 cm in rocky soil in one
of the two shovel tests placed at the site. The bone did not appear to be very old and no other subsurface
artifacts were recovered from either test. Further shovel testing is needed to more accurately assess the
site. For this reason, the site is left in the category of those that are potentially eligible for designation as
SALs.

72

Figure 32. Site 41BT362

41BT377
This site comprises a diffuse lithic scatter located just within the eastern boundary line of the LCRA
Double Horn Resource Area approximately 700 meters southwest of the south bank of the Colorado River
(Figure 33). It is about 50 meters east of an unnamed dry creek which enters the Colorado River 450
meters downstream from the Double Horn confluence. The site probably extends a short distance to the
southeast onto private land, an area not investigated during the 2004 survey. The cultural material is
73

spread out on a low slope between the dry creek to the west and a steep escarpment to the east. A juniper
woodland covers the site. Cultural material is very sparse, consisting of about a dozen pieces of chert
debitage and some scattered pieces of possible burned rock.

Figure 33. Map of 41BT377.

Most of the known cultural material is confined to the surface even though soils are alluvial in origin.
Based on the widely scattered nature of surface finds and lack of any substantial subsurface deposits, the
site is assessed as not eligible for designation as an SAL.

74

41BT389
The LCRA-owned portion of this site extends along the top and slope of an escarpment immediately
downstream and east of 41BT100 (Figure 34). A small wash separates the two sites. The escarpment
marks the beginning of the upland margin and butts up against Lake Travis to the north. The prehistoric
component of this site extends away from the lake and outside the LCRA property through juniper woods
to include an unmapped spring and burned rock middens. The ruins of a farmhouse originally built in late
19th or early 20th century lie just outside property and an earlier homestead site with ruined fireplace lies a
short distance to the south.
The extent of the site northwards below the escarpments and onto the low-lying areas adjacent to the
Colorado River channel has been determined because this area is normally inundated by the lake.
Although artifacts and burned rock have been noted at the base of the escarpment when the lake is low,
these most likely have fallen down from the deposits on top of the slope. Due to its position on the
meander, low-lying areas have probably been scoured by flood waters.
Dense cultural material has been recovered from the soils along the upper edge of the escarpment during
shovel testing by LCRA archeologists. The depth of this soil varies from 20 or less cm up to 95 cm and
may in part represent recent colluvial buildup, especially against the inland side a picket fence that runs
along the eastern edge of the escarpment. Artifacts recovered from testing include Early to Late Archaic
points, tools, burned rock, and mussel shell. Based on these finds, the site is assessed as potentially
eligible for formal designation as an SAL.

Figure 34. 41BT389 Map.

75

41BT410
This prehistoric site is located in the northwest corner of the DHRA, and the site undoubtedly extends
north and westward beyond the LCRA property boundaries (see Figure 9). The portion of the site within
LCRA property covers an area measuring about 130 x 30 meters and is in a large clearing (Figure 35).
The site is situated in the uplands north of Double Horn Creek, but is not far from an apparent spring-fed
tributary creek that lies to the north outside LCRA property.

Figure 35. Site 41BT410 looking south.

Materials collected at this site consist of two manos, two metate fragments, one Castroville point
fragment, one Fairland point fragment, two unidentifiable dart point fragments, one biface fragment, one
edge-modified flake, and some chert debitage. Five shovel tests were excavated at the site with three of
these being sterile. The other two produced a few artifacts in the uppermost level.
The diversity of artifacts is of interest, and could suggest that the site functioned as a logistical support
area for larger camps nearer the creek and river. Additional survey beyond the preserve boundaries
would aid in determining if the materials seen within the preserve boundaries represent the edge of a
larger potential campsite associated with spring-fed creek. At present, this site is assessed as potentially
eligible for formal designation as an SAL.

41BT411
This historic period trash dump is located along the west fenceline of the DHRA about 300 meters south
of 41BT410 (see Figure 9). The site is situated in an area with Ashe juniper trees. Two clusters of
historic debris were noted with the overall site area covering an area about 20 meters in diameter.

76

Materials in the first cluster included evaporated milk cans dating from 1943 to 1945, a clock spring,
ketchup bottles, Clorox jugs, sardine cans, and long neck beer bottles. In the second dump, a stove pipe,
tires, some ceramic stoneware, beer bottles, a wash tub, cast iron stove parts, a bed spring, a small stove,
some tin cans with punch top holes, and some oil filters were present.
The site is interpreted at an early to mid 20th century trash dump with the two clusters of materials
possibly representing individual dump episodes. The origin place of the materials is uncertain, and it is
possible that the site continues westward beyond the LCRA property. The portion of the site on LCRA
property is assessed as not eligible for formal designation as an SAL.

41BT412
This prehistoric campsite is located on the north bank of Double Horn Creek about 1.5 km upstream from
its juncture with the Colorado River (Figure 36). The site is situated on a long, narrow rocky bench
covered with thin sediment at the base of abrupt, jagged limestone boulder outcrops (Figure 37). Three
potential bedrock mortar holes are evident on a limestone bedrock shelf adjacent to the north bank of the
creek. These holes likely formed by natural processes since similar holes are found in the creekbed.
Overall, the site covers an area measuring about 130 meters east-west by 30 to 40 meters north-south.
Surface inspection and shovel testing showed that chert chipping debris, burned rocks, and mussel shells
area present on the surface and in some areas down to a depth of 60 cm below ground surface. A
probable burned rock hearth feature was struck in ST 2 from 27 to 40 cm below ground surface. The
only diagnostic artifact found during the investigation is a Pedernales point fragment that came from level
3 in ST 1.
The site appears to be a discrete prehistoric occupational area with buried materials down to 40 to 60 cm
below ground surface in some areas. The cultural material was probably buried by sediments deposited
by overbank flooding and colluvium washed down from the steep slope north of the site. Site 41BT412 is
assessed as a potentially significant due to the presence of buried features and is potentially eligible for
SAL designation.
41BT417
Site 41BT417 is multi-component site located within the far northern part of the DHRA on the upper edge
of a high terrace where alluvial gravels are exposed on the surface (see Figure 9). Because the site was
recorded during a survey for a proposed boundary fence, only a 10-foot wide strip of land on the LCRA
side of fence was surveyed. The site was revisited for a brush clearing project and found to extend to the
south. The site area probably also extends to the north, east, and west an unknown distance. Since the
prehistoric component primarily represents procurement activities, the site area probably follows the
terrace edge. Surface visibility was excellent in the surveyed area because of recent clearing for a
firebreak.
The prehistoric artifact density is extremely low, with only one biface, one core, and four flakes observed
within the 0.35 acre site area surveyed. The surface within the firebreak was also littered with hundreds
of fragments of chert cobbles broken by heavy machinery, which made locating actual (prehistoric)
artifacts difficult.

77

Figure 36. Site 41BT412

Figure 37. Site 41BT412 take from opposite bank of Double Horn Creek, looking northwest.

78

The historic component consists of a tight scatter of three salt-glaze stoneware sherds and one small sherd
of brown-glazed pottery on the edge of the firebreak. All the stoneware sherds appeared to belong to
same vessel and no other historic artifacts besides the one pottery sherd were seen in the site area. Salt
glaze was the most common glaze on stoneware in Texas until around 1875 (Lebo and Cliff 2001). The
portion of the site within the LCRA property is assessed as not eligible for formal designation as an SAL.
41BT418
This site is located along the north property fence on the upper edge of a high terrace projection
overlooking the Colorado River floodplain to the east (Figure 38). All the artifacts were seen within a 40
meter stretch of the firebreak scrape and in the push piles along the south edge of the break. The area to
the south of the firebreak is covered by a dense thicket of mesquite and juniper while the private property
north of the fence has been kept cleared for pasture.
Artifacts consist of five small tertiary flakes, one core, and two pieces of burned rock. Five heavily
weathered long bones of a calf (cow or bison) were also present at the site. Similarly weathered cow
bones noted on the surface near the fence 600 meters to the west are clearly recent. However, at least one
bone was buried at least 10 cm below the surface and was exposed in the scrape. The bones mainly occur
in the area containing the densest cultural material.
No cultural material was recovered from two shovel tests placed in the site and the cultural deposits
appear to be sparse and shallowly buried within the project area. Still the evidence points to the site being
a small camp or even an animal processing site, and therefore is potentially significant. Additional testing
will be needed to determine its SAL eligibility.

Figure 38. Site 41BT418 looking west towards top of terrace.

79

41BT438
This prehistoric site contains a hearth and a few artifacts exposed in the Colorado River cutbank 350
meters north of Double Horn Creek (Figure 39). Most of the cultural material was seen lying on the
surface of a bench or ledge roughly at the full pool elevation of Lake Travis (680'). No cultural material
was seen protruding from the cutbank wall. Density of artifacts appears low with only two flakes and a
pecked metate fragment seen in addition to the hearth.
The hearth (Feature 1) consists of a horizontal layer of ten burned limestone rocks exposed on the bench
which may have formed by slumping or by erosion of overlying sediments caused by waves. Therefore
this feature may have originated at a slight higher elevation but its structural integrity suggests that its
movement was not too far. Another rock "pavement" (Feature 2) is located at the same level of the
cutbank 34 meters to the north, but most of the rocks do not appear burned and this might be a natural
gravel lens.
Site 41BT438 could be eligible for SAL designation if enough of the site still remains in the terrace. The
site appears similar to 41BT272 in the Colorado River cutbank south of Double Horn Creek in that it
contains chert chipping debris with a few isolated hearths. Additional investigation of both of these sites
is needed.
Summary
Deep Terrace Sites
The Lake Travis conservation pool has inundated large expanses of Holocene-era alluvial terraces (the
lowland/floodplain zone). Because the Double Horn Resource Area is located near the upper end of the
lake, these alluvial terraces are above the conservation pool level, and, thus available for investigation.
These settings were a prime location for prehistoric campsites because of the abundant water provided by
the spring-fed Double Creek and the adjacent Colorado River channel. Through time the terraces rose in
height from flood silts deposited by overbank flooding, thus burying numerous prehistoric components at
sites such as 41BT36, 41BT37, and 41BT336.
Archaic components are found in the 41BT37 terrace down to a depth of at least two meters and these
surely go much deeper. Much of the information on these deep deposits comes from the artifact recovery
and wall profiles of the two-by-two meter test unit excavated in 2001 (Prikryl et al. 2004). The sediments
from the surface down to a depth of 170 to 180 cm in the test pit profile at 41BT37 have a brownish hue
and may correspond to the Qal-1 Late Holocene fill described by Blum and Lintz (1993) much further
upstream at the O. H. Ivie Reservoir. The Qal-1 fill at O. H. Ivie built up between 2500 BC and AD 950.
Below this fill in the test pit profile at 41BT37, the color of the sediments changes markedly to a reddish
hue, and may correspond to the upper portion of Blum and Lintz’s (1993) Qal-2 Early to Middle
Holocene fill, deposited from roughly 8000 to 3000 BC. The vertical positions of the dateable artifacts
appear to support this interpretation although excavation deeper into the Qal-2 zone will be needed for its
verification. Surface observations and shovel test profiles from work at the DHRA indicate that the top of
Qal-2 zone rises as one goes away from the river channel, eventually breaking to the surface on the east
side of 41BT36.

Figure 39. Map of 41BT438.

The latest prehistoric material is found in the low alluvial benches that were deposited around AD 1000,
during the most recent phase of aggradation. Toyah Phase (AD 1300-1650) artifacts, such as the bonetempered pottery sherds at 41BT100, commonly occur in these low benches. Three burned rock features
exposed in a cutbank at 41BT336 include an unusually large baking pit (Feature 1) and two smaller
hearths. These features probably date to the Late Prehistoric and/or Late Archaic periods. The cultural
deposits in these low-lying landforms have suffered from the effects of inundation, especially slumping
along the cutbank. The near-surface deposits found in the higher Qal-1 alluvial terraces at 41BT37 also
contain Toyah-period material, indicating there was little if any sedimentation during or after this
occupation.

81

Burned Rock Middens
All the known burned rock midden features in the DHRA are located in the upland margins. Stone for
these features was more readily available in this environmental zone than on the alluvial terraces. Also,
these features are more visible in areas with relatively thin soil cover. Middens are known at sites
41BT169, 41BT170, and 41BT342, while 41BT389 has middens in portions of the site outside the
DHRA. The midden at 41BT342 rests on a rocky bench overlooking the creek to the south and is the
only midden in the DHRA that has a mound-like topography. On the other hand, the middens at
41BT169 and 41BT170 are completely buried within the sediments that line this stretch of Double Horn
Creek.
The only evidence of the 41BT169 midden location was a loose cluster of burned rocks on the ground
surface presumably dislodged from the top surface of the midden by plowing or other shallow
disturbances. A shovel test encountered typical burned rock midden deposits from near the surface down
to at least 60 cm. Without further testing, the only indication of the feature’s size is the extent of the
surface burned rock scatter, which is 14 meters north to south and 12 meters east to west. A similar
surface scatter of burned rocks located approximately 100 meters to the southeast has not been tested.
The 41BT170 burned rock midden is exposed in a cutbank of the intermittent tributary of Double Horn
Creek. Before many of the rocks were dislodged by vandals, the profile showed a stratum of denselypacked burned rocks 30 to 40 cm thick, the top of which was about one meter below the ground surface.
Only a small section of the midden was exposed and its horizontal extent is unknown. It is possible that
the bulk of it was removed by stream flow during past floods.
Upland Margin Campsites
Upland margin sites include extensive aboriginal camping areas, often inland extensions of sites that are
present in the lowland/floodplain. Because these areas are out of reach of overbank flooding, prehistoric
features, including the remains of hearths or baking pits, are sometimes found exposed on the ground
surface. Diagnostic artifacts from the upland margin include examples from nearly all prehistoric periods,
from Late Paleoindian (circa 8000 BC) to Late Prehistoric (ending circa AD 1650). The archaeological
importance of sites on the upland margin is compromised by the mixing of cultural material from
different cultural groups, although areas potentially exist with a minimum of component overprinting.
Sites 41BT36, 41BT169, and 41BT170 all have scattered burned rock clusters from prehistoric hearths or
ovens resting on elevated surfaces above (and some distance from) the Double Horn Creek channel. In
the case 41BT36, scattered hearths rest on eroded surfaces near the crest of the slope leading up from the
creek. An unfinished San Patrice point (8000 BC) was found nearby, but its association with the hearths
is uncertain. Site 41BT169 has two scattered hearths on nearly level ground between 200 and 250 meters
south of the creek, and at 41BT170 a scattered hearth is located nearly 300 meters from the creek channel.
These hearths or deflated ovens are generally few in number with only one or two know from each of the
upland margin sites. This suggests that areas over 100 meters from the creek edge were not intensively
used for activities requiring heated rocks. Areas closer to the creek are covered with sediments of varying
depths and are expected to contain more burned rock features.
Site 41BT410 contains no known burned rock but its artifact assemblage includes groundstone. A
logistical relationship to nearby campsites closer to water sources can be inferred.

82

Lithic Procurement and Lithic scatter Sites
Within the DHRA, sources of high quality chert outside the channels of the two principal streams are
restricted to two areas south of and one area north of Double Horn Creek in remnants of Pleistocene
terraces. All three areas contain evidence of prehistoric use as lithic procurement locales. The largest of
these, 41BT172, is situated south of Double Horn Creek on a small knoll. Another small lithic
procurement area was located adjacent to a nearby limestone outcrop, and was recorded as a separate site,
41BT363.
The third lithic procurement site, 41BT417, is located on the north boundary of the DHRA. At 41BT417,
the field crew noted numerous chert cobbles that had been previously broken by heavy machinery, but
few actual prehistoric artifacts. It is possible that this chert source extends northward outside of the
DHRA.
Historic sites
Five historic components consisting of three farmsteads and two trash dumps were recorded during the
survey of the DHRA. The historic components at 41BT36, 41BT169, and 41BT260 are former
farmsteads, with 41BT36 and 41BT260 still retaining standing structures. All three of these farmsteads
have the potential to yield additional data about the early Double Horn Community. The date of the
earliest construction of the house at 41BT260 is uncertain, but it could date as early as the mid to late 19th
century. The nearby house at 41BT36 was in existence by the turn of the century but its actual building
date is unknown. No documentation has been found on a second former house site at 41BT36 located on
the terrace of Area A. All that remains are a few stone piers and a 19th century artifact scatter over a
mounded area.
The stone piers of a third house have been documented at 41BT169 on the south side of the creek along
with a smaller grouping of piers belonging to an outbuilding. About 170 meters to the southwest of these
remains is a group of standing structures that includes a log crib, a plank animal pen, and a concrete
dipping vat. The historic component at 41BT389 contains a small dump composed of patent medicine
bottles from the late 19th to very early 20th
Research

Geomorphology and Site Formation
The Double Horn/Colorado River confluence presents a dynamic alluvial environment that is extensive
and complex. In fact, the Double Horn tract, together with the LCRA’s Shaffer Bend tract on the
opposite side of the Colorado River contains some of the largest expanses of Holocene alluvial landforms
along the Highland Lakes chain. More studies of the area’s geopmorphology, especially the dating of the
migration of both streams, is needed before any meaningful interpretation of the floodplain/terrace sites
can be made. For example, the low prehistoric artifact density present at some sites along the present
Colorado River terrace may suggest that the river channel was some distance away when these sediments
were accumulating. Alternatively, occupational materials may have been rapidly buried by floods before
large numbers of artifacts could accumulate on a living surface. Another explanation might be that
aboriginal people preferred to camp along the creek as opposed to the river.
Research can be directed at better understanding the depositional and pedogenic processes that have taken
place on the Colorado River floodplain. Tthe floodplain across the river in the Shaffer Bend Recreation
Area will probably provide more evidence of Colorado River migration during the mid to late Holocene
since this is where the lateral point bar deposits have accumulated in the last 5000 years or so.
83

If the data from the small test pit at 41BT37 is representative, then the alluvium has accumulated at an
average rate of about 1 cm every 25 years over the last 4,500 years on the terrace north of Double Horn
Creek. Discrete components and activity areas will best be preserved in this terrace where occupation
was not continuous over long periods at the same localized area.
Small discrete areas with buried artifacts and features are known to exist in the floodplain at 41BT272
and 41BT438, but these components would be logistically difficult to excavate because of their depth.
Shallower occupation surfaces possibly exist in the lower terraces upstream on Double Horn Creek where
sediment accumulated rapidly over a relatively short period of time. These terraces probably began
building up one thousand years ago or slightly earlier and should contain mostly Late Prehistoric
occupations. Low, recent terraces are also found on the Colorado River at the south end of the park and
appear to be of similar age to the Double Horn Creek terraces. Excavation of living surfaces in these
landforms, if they exist, might prove useful in understanding the kinds of human behaviors that occurred
along stream banks.
Burned Rock Midden Research
Many burned rock middens in central Texas have formed on nonaggrading landforms and are surrounded
by thin, culturally mixed deposits which limit their potential for dating and studying the behaviors that
took place around these features. The middens at 41BT169 and 41BT170 are completely buried and
formed either before or during the formation of present-day terraces and therefore associated artifact and
feature patterns might be reasonably well-preserved. Plant remains also have a better chance of long-term
survival in buried middens than exposed ones.

Management Priorities
Cutbank Erosion
Large areas of several sites in the resource area have been lost due to cutbank erosion, a natural process
related to stream channel migration and periodic flooding. However, long periods of inundation by Lake
Travis have probably had detrimental effects as well, exacerbating the effects of erosion by softening and
destabilizing the stream banks. Erosion from waves undercuts the banks at water level, resulting in
sloughing or slumping of archeological deposits not in direct contact with the water. Unfortunately, it is
logistically infeasible to prevent the erosion. Instead periodic monitoring of the cutbank within known
site areas can be done to see if any hearths or other features are becoming exposed. These can be
recorded and, if considered significant, then data can be recovered through emergency excavation.
Site 41BT37 is perhaps the most at risk because it lies in the migration path of both the Colorado River
and Double Horn Creek. The river is currently moving laterally to the west and south while the creek
channel is moving northwards, removing the eastern and southern areas of the site (Figure 40). How
much of the site has been lost is impossible to determine since the process of site formation has been
concurrent with channel migration. The downcutting of the stream channel, postulated to have occurred
around 1000 BP, may have slowed channel migration, but the erosion due to wave action from the lake,
as stated above, continues to cause sloughing of the steep cutbanks on the east and south side of the site.
Site 41BT100 faces the Colorado River at the downstream curve of the meander. At this location, the
lower alluvial terraces take the full force of the river at flood stage. Wave erosion is another serious
problem since the full pool shoreline lies at the same elevation as the lower alluvial terrace.

84

Site 41BT336 is located where an intermittent creek joins Double Horn Creek. In the recent past the
site’s south side has been eroded by the intermittent stream from the south, while the north is being
eroded by Double Horn Creek when at flood stage, and by wave action when the lake is near its full pool
level. Feature 1, the “Smiley-face Hearth,” mostly sloughed off into the creek channel during the 2007
flood (Figure 41). Fortunately the feature had been thoroughly recorded by the LCRA’s Archeology
Services staff and charcoal samples taken for future radiocarbon dating.

towards Colorado River.

85

Vandalism
The DHRA is surrounded by private property making access by land difficult for would-be relic hunters.
But by water it is a very different matter since the lake is public and people can travel on it freely. Only
the high banks along stretches of the Colorado River discourage trespassing. It is not surprising then that
the two sites located at the easiest access point on the river for boats, 41BT100 and 41BT389, have both
been vandalized in recent years. At these sites, most of the unauthorized digging has taken place in
wooded areas, probably because they offer concealment, and also because they happen to have the
densest archeological deposits.
Boats can also freely travel up Double Horn Creek when the lake is near full pool. Evidence of looting
can be seen a short distance inland from the shoreline at places such as the outcrop at 41BT170. Most
the digging along the creek appears to have been done from boats, with vandals scraping the cutbanks,
especially in areas with burned rock exposures, such as at 41BT169 and across the tributary at 41BT170.
Long Term Preservation of Cultural Resource Sites
Sites 41BT36 and 41BT37 have been formally designated as SALs by the Texas Historical Commission.
As shown in Table 1, five other sites, 41BT100, 41BT169, 41BT170, 41BT336, and 41BT342 are rated
as eligible for formal designation as SALs. Another 12 sites are assessed as potentially eligible for SAL
designation.
The DHRA is currently closed to the public to protect its exceptional resources and because of limitations
of public right of way. Should the DHRA ever become a developed park, planning efforts should focus
on avoiding significant and potentially significant cultural resource sites. The alternative would be test
excavations and costly mitigation. Still, there are extensive areas of the floodplain that do not have
archeological materials within the upper 120 cm of soil and large areas within the upland margins that
either have no sites at all or sites with thin, mixed deposits that are not eligible for SAL designation.
These areas, (dependant on additional testing), would probably be suitable for future park development.
The bigger challenge would be preventing park visitors from damaging archeological sites.

Management Summary
LCRA proposes to rebuild an existing transmission line that runs for 23.75 miles between the Evant
substation (located just south of Evant, in Lampasas County) and the Goldthwaite substation (located just
south of Goldthwaite in Mills County) and passes through a small portion of Hamilton County (Figure 42,
Figure 43, Figure 44, Figure 45 ,Figure 46, Figure 47, Figure 48, Figure 49 [Figures 43-49 detail the line
sequentially from east to west]). The ROW will maintain a 100-ft wide corridor, which results in a total
project area of 288 acres. Existing wooden H-frame and three-pole angle structures will be replaced with
single pole cement or steel structures, each within 10-15 ft of existing locations, and typically to the west
of the present structures. The line was surveyed for cultural resources in 2004 prior to standard line
maintenance activities. This was the first known survey of the line, and resulted in the recording of seven
archaeological sites, 41LM46, 47 and 48, and 41MI97, 98, 99 and 100. Only one site, 41MI98, was
recommended for any kind of avoidance.
The present survey emphasized testing areas considered to be of high probability for containing buried
cultural resource sites that may have been missed previously due to the differing impact expectations.
Because the line has been recently cleared and deep impacts will be at known locations, the survey
focused on structure locations near stream terraces. Additional surface and near surface impacts were
considered.
As a result of the investigations five new archaeological sites, 41ML61 and 41MI109-112, were recorded.
Site 41MI98 was revisited, and site 41MI99 was enlarged. All sites have prehistoric components,
although two, 41LM61 and 41MI112 are considered to be primarily historic, with 41MI112 associated
with a structure mapped at least as early as 1948. The rest of the sites are prehistoric, and include lithic
scatters/open camps and lithic procurement locations. Only one, 41MI110 is felt to have additional (but
unknown) research potential near the ROW (although not within it). This area will be marked for
avoidance. The remainder are considered to be fully recorded and not eligible for formal listing as State
Archeological Landmarks or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
It is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed with the understanding that the one area outside
the ROW at 41MI110, near Structure (STR) 9/4 will be avoided by ground disturbing activities during
construction. Elsewhere, no restrictions or conditions are necessary.
There was no collection of artifacts during this project, so no curation of such will be necessary.

Environmental Background
The project area lies with the Lampasas Cut Plain region of Texas, an extension of Edwards Plateau
geology that has been more heavily dissected, creating an alternating relief of flat mesas and wide
lowlands (Johnson 2007). Exposed geology is almost entirely of Cretaceous-aged limestone formations,
with the exception of Holocene valley fill along the Lampasas River and Bennett Creek. Soils are
primarily of the Brackett, Tarrant, Tarpley and Bolar series, which are typically stony, often shallow, and
clayey or loamy. Along the floodplains of the Lampasas River and Bennett Creek deeper alluvium has
accumulated. Vegetation is primarily Oak - Mesquite - Juniper parks and woods with associated herbs,
forbs and grasses (McMahan et al. 1984). Except for the far western portion of the project, near
Goldthwaite, which is drained by the Colorado River, the project area is within the Lampasas River
drainage system.

Cultural Background
The project is primarily within Mills County, named for John T. Mills, an early Texas judge (Hunt and
Leffler 2002). It was first settled in 1852, and conflicts with American Indians were frequent. Following
the Civil War there was a long period of lawlessness and vigilantism. The railroad came through in 1885,
and the county was formally established in 1887, with Goldthwaite as the county seat. Joe G.
Goldthwaite was a railroad official (Edwards 2007), and for a while the town was planned to be a major
railroad intersection. A county jail was built in 1888, and the courthouse was completed in 1890. Both
ranching and farming were important economic pursuits in Mills and surrounding counties, although
farming proved to be somewhat difficult, and ranching was a more stable enterprise. Some
manufacturing now occurs, and there was as short-lived oil boom in the 1980s.
Eastward, north of the transmission line, are the small communities of Star, named for Star Mountain
(Bowles 2007), and Center City, originally called Hughes Store but renamed when an early survey
designated an oak tree in the community as the exact geographical center of Texas (Hazelwood 2007).
The town of Evant, actually in Coryell County, was first settled in the 1850s (Smyrl 2007). Evant Brooks
donated sixty acres in 1881, and the resulting town was named for him. It has remained a small
community, never exceeding a population of 550.
Prehistorically, the project area falls within the Central Texas archaeological region as defined by Prewitt
(1981, 1985), and discussed by many (e.g. Collins 1995, Ellis et. al 1995). Generally, hunter-gatherers
exploited a wide range of plant and animal resources and maintained a semi- to highly nomadic lifeway
that varied in specifics due to climactic, geographic and social factors, through a period of at least 12,000
years. The present area, falling near the western edge of the Lampasas Cut Plain portion of the Balcones
Escarpment can be expected to share aspects of strategies required to subsist in prairie, riverine and
upland settings, through which people undoubtedly moved or otherwise interacted with.
The relatively low number of previously recorded sites within Lampasas and Mills counties is at least
partially a reflection of the limited number of projects in the area. Near the present project the Historic
Texas Sites Atlas indicates projects for enhancements on U.S. Highway 183 and some work on the
Lometa water supply system. A random review of site forms indicates shallow lithic and burned rock
scatters are common.

Research Design and Methods
The line had been previously surveyed for cultural resources by LCRA staff in 2004, prior to standard
maintenance activities, which typically involve shredding or otherwise removing or trimming vegetation,
repairing fences and gates, and occasionally replacing wooden poles. Survey is typically commensurate
with the level of expected impact, and does not generally include prospecting for buried sites in nonimpact areas.
Prior to the present survey, geologic and soils maps and other data were consulted to identify locations
with the potential to contain buried archaeological materials. The survey was designed to revisit select
high probability areas and to reevaluate site 41MI98. Because it was clear that standard shovel testing in
many areas would be impractical, due both to deep soils and a prolonged, soil-hardening drought, a 14inch (45 cm) diameter mechanical auger mounted on a skidsteer (Bobcat) was used for the majority of
testing. Experience with this method has demonstrated that tight horizontal control (20-cm levels) with
little to no disturbance of sidewalls is usually possible. It is also possible to test at much greater depths
(100-130 cm) than is physically possible using traditional methods. All tests (shovel and auger) are
therefore referred to as Subsurface Tests (STs).
93

New structure locations have already been determined, and will be within 10-20 ft of existing structures,
and usually placed to the west. Testing could therefore be limited to these areas, and often was as in the
case with the west terrace of Bennett Creek, where two structures will be replaced, and visibility in the
open pasture showed no evidence of cultural material. Negative results at both existing structure
locations indicated no need for further investigations there.
Original calculations, based strictly on review of relevant data, indicated there were about 5.7 total miles
of high probability area, or about 25 percent of the total line (field observations reduced that amount, but
no in a quantifiable manner). Minimum survey standards suggest a total of 91 shovel tests for that length
of a 100-ft wide linear project. A total of 41 subsurface tests were excavated, or 45 percent of that
amount. This is considered adequate based on the known areas proposed for disturbance, the generally
thin soils, and often excellent visibility in pastures, fields, creek banks and other natural features.
Of the previously recorded sites, only one (41MI98) had been recommended for any type of avoidance or
considered to be potentially eligible within the ROW. The remaining six sites were not revisited,
although 41MI99 was enlarged.
Field orientation was accomplished by way of USGS, aerial and project-specific maps, and figures.
Records included field notes, sketch maps and subsurface test records. A no collection policy was
maintained throughout the project.

Results of Investigation
Five previously unrecorded archaeological sites were documented, one previously recorded site was
revisited, and one site was enlarged. All of the sites had prehistoric components, and two of the sites
were considered primarily historic in nature, one an ephemeral artifact scatter and one apparently
associated with a homesite. Site 41MI98 was reassessed, and 41MI99 was enlarged following incidental
observations. Subsurface investigations focused on the Lampasas River, Bennett Creek, South Bennett
Creek, and their larger tributaries.
41LM61
This is a multicomponent historic and prehistoric site located on either side of Beef Pen Spring near the
eastern end of the project area in Lampasas County (Figure 50). Soils are mapped as very stony Nuff silty
clay loam that is within a narrow band of Paluxy sandstone that divides younger Walnut formation
limestone from older Glen Rose limestone. Observed vegetation was primarily short and tall grass in
cleared pasture with juniper along the short, unnamed tributary to the Dry Branch of the Lampasas River.
Despite abnormally dry conditions, some water was present in small pools that appear to represent Beef
Pen Spring, which may be more of a seep than an actual spring. The prehistoric component is very minor
and discontinuous, consisting of three to four flakes and an extremely beat up biface (probable projectile)
in highly eroded soils on the west side of the drainage. A single tertiary flake was found in a shovel test
on the high lobe to the east of the creek. The historic component consists of a light but relatively discrete
scatter of white stoneware, solarized (purple), brown, aqua and brown glass, as well as various scraps of
metal. These are all located on the same high lobe east of the drainage. This entire area has been heavily
disturbed by land clearing, and a recently constructed home is just outside the ROW to the south. Across
an existing road that fronts the site to the north is another structure that dates much earlier, although it has
been remodeled somewhat and it is difficult to determine its age. The site boundaries were determined by
a total of six shovel tests (STs 28-32, and one excavated in 2004) as well as excellent visibility near the

94

drainage. These tests and observations indicate the present-day extent of the site is about 230 m in length
within the ROW, and is almost entirely to the east of the drainage.
The prehistoric component is probably representative of what was once a more extensive site, given the
semi-reliable water source. The historic trash scatter may be associated with the present property
boundary or the structure across the road to the north. No structures are indicated on either the 1885,
1954 or modern USGS maps. Both components serve to indicate land use over time, but neither contains
sufficient integrity within the ROW (and most likely outside as well) to warrant additional investigations
or formal placement on state or national registers.
41MI109
41MI109 is a prehistoric open camp and lithic scatter that contained one apparent Late Archaic (heavily
reworked Ensor) projectile point (Figure 51). A low mound just outside the ROW was seen to have
apparent burned limestone and minor amounts of lithic debitage. This may be a small burned rock
midden but is more likely a natural high point with burned rock upon it. Another discrete scatter of
angular, perhaps fire-cracked, limestone of large size (15-30 cm diameter) was observed out of the ROW
to the west and north of the mapped site. The site is within and upon Bolar/Brackett complex (at lower
elevations) and Rowena clay loam (higher elevations) soils in Glen Rose formation limestone overlooking
Slaughter Branch, a tributary of Bennett Creek. At present the area is lightly used pasture with grass, oak
and juniper vegetation in a park-like setting. A long trench, about 18 cm deep, 10 m wide and at least 80
m long, running parallel with the transmission line, had been excavated by unknown persons, perhaps for
erosion control or water storage. It did not appear to be an attempt to disturb the site. Seven shovel tests
(STs 33-39) were excavated within and around the site. Only three had definite cultural material which
was limited to very small amounts (one-three pieces) of lithic debitage in addition to the apparent Ensor
point. Three tests near the existing structure exhibited disturbance through mixing of differing soil types
in the upper zones. Soils did not exceed about 35 cm before clays or bedrock was encountered. The
shallow soils, general lack of artifacts or evidence of features within the ROW indicate the site lacks
information potential that would make it eligible for state or federal registers within the ROW. The
possible burned rock midden is within an area of potential effect however, as the angle structure (STR
9/4) at this location may require movement outside of the ROW. This area is recommended for
avoidance. If avoidance is not possible then additional survey level work to determine potential eligibility
is recommended, with follow-up investigations if necessary.
41MI110
41MI110 is a lithic procurement locale located on the exposed east-facing edge of an upland ridge system
that creates a number of small tributaries to Bennett Creek (Figure 52). Mapped soils are of the Bolar
Brackett complex and fall within the same, narrow Paluxy sandstone configuration as 41LM61. Soils are
eroded and visibility is excellent within the site. No shovel tests were excavated. Artifacts consisted of
widely distributed multidirectional and bidirectional cores and hard hammer flakes. A notable aspect of
this site was the extremely poor quality of the raw material, which was interpreted in the field as a cherty
limestone, but may in fact have been the quartz sandstone described for the Paluxy formation (Kier et. al
BEG). This site, perhaps 120 m in length with the ROW, is useful for settlement studies that might
include approaches such as embedded and logistical procurement strategies, especially when tracking
movement across chert-poor areas. The portion of the site within the ROW (and most likely its entirety)
has little additional research value and is not considered eligible for formal listing on state or national
registers.
About 165 m east of the structure located within the site (STR 12/5), immediately adjacent to STR 12/4,
was seen an apparent/possible hearth on the ground surface. A shovel test was placed next to this feature
95

and failed to recover any artifacts. Close inspection of the nearby creek channel and other exposures
likewise did not produce any evidence of human use, other than for a single sherd of white stoneware.
The feature could not, therefore, be documented as having a cultural origin, but is reported here for
reference purposes.
41MI111
41MI111 is a largely surficial lithic scatter located at the edge of a plowed field and bank of a minor
tributary to Bennett Creek (Figure 53). It is within Krum silty clay soils overlying Walnut formation
limestone. The site, about 20 m in diameter, was defined by three subsurface tests (STs 17-19) and
excellent surface visibility. ST 17 recovered 2 flakes from between 40 and 60 cm, below an abrupt
boundary between dark grayish brown heavy clay loam and yellowish brown silty clay loam that occurred
at about 19 cmbs. Both these flakes were heavily patinated, and were identical in that respect to the few
other artifacts seen on the ground surface, which included about seven chips and flakes and a single 8 cm
blade-like flake, and are therefore considered intrusive. About 100 m due north, well out of the ROW, a
few non-patinated chips were seen along the field edge, suggesting multiple periods of use. The mapped
Krum soils corresponded almost exactly with the area that had been plowed, and testing and surface
observations across the rest of the field within the ROW found no more artifacts. The site is thus
recorded as an ephemeral, surficial lithic scatter. It is considered to be fully documented and ineligible
for formal state of federal registers.
41MI112
41MI112 is located near the western end of the project area at the base of a 100-ft escarpment marked by
a drainage presumably originating from groundwater (Figure 54). Soils are once again of the BolarBrackett complex over Walnut formation limestone. The site consists of a very light scatter of both
historic and prehistoric material across a low outcrop of caliche and bedrock. The prehistoric material
consisted of perhaps two flakes and a core. The historic material consisted of about 20 pieces of purple,
aqua, clear and brown glass along with scattered bits of metal. The purple and aqua glass appears to have
originated from two or three individual containers. The 1948 Goldthwaite quad indicates a structure at or
very near this location. The 1925 Goldthwaite quad does not actually show the Goldthwaite area, but
references the 1885 San Saba map, which has very little detail, although it does indicate that the nearby
Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad (then the Gulf Colorado and Santa Fe) once passed about 100
meters to the west (it now is 220 m to the west of this site).
A title run was made by LCRA real estate staff on February 24, 2009. The site is located on a portion of
the J. B. Brinson Patent, sold in 1895 from the General Land Office Public Free School Lands. The
property apparently was immediately assigned to J. D. McKenzie, although this was not formally
recognized until a 1936 patent record signed by Governor James Allred. McKenzie, in the meantime,
sold the property to a Bettie Tyson in 1909, who by 1916 was married to P. D. Duren. She appears to
have sold the property prior to her marriage, as a replacement deed dated 1916 was necessary before the
new owner, W. D. Reynolds, could complete the resale of the property to S. L. Phillips, in 1917. The
property passed, possibly through inheritance, to a Robert O. Phillips, who in 1946 sold to Koen Harrel,
who two years later sold to Carlos Patterson. The present owner is shown as Mrs. Cornelia Boykin.
According to a phone conversation with her husband, the Patterson’s were her parents (his in-laws), and
the Boykin’s had owned the property since the early 1970s. Mr. Boykin was not aware of any structures
or artifacts, and he stated the Pattersons were long-deceased.
Additional information about some of the landowners was gathered through internet sources including
Google, The Handbook of Texas Online, and the Mills County TxGenWeb project
96

(http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~txmills/mills.html). J. B. (Jason Burrel) Brinson was a Confederate
veteran who served with the Fifth Georgia Cavalry as a Second Corporal, then Second Sergeant
(http://www.fifthgacavalry.info/5thcavalry/5thcav/troope.htm. In 1864 he was shown as wounded on a
roll call. His move from Georgia to Texas was apparently precipitated by the shooting of a carpetbagger
who claimed to have purchased his Georgia homestead. Following his move to Mills County he became
a deputy sheriff. Brinson was a member of the Jeff Davis United Confederate Veterans Association, and
apparently was also able to receive a Confederate pension. Also listed as receiving a pension in Mills
County was an Asa McKinzie. J. D. McKenzie is referred to at least once as “McKinzie” in deed records,
so there may be some connection between the two. No specific information was found for Tyson, Duren,
Reynolds, Phillips or Boykin, although all still appear to have living relatives in the area. Koen Harrrel
served as a cook in World War I.
The structure represented by 41MI112 is most likely that of the McKenzie or Tyson/Duren families.
There is no indication that it had any relationship to the nearby railroad. Given the very small artifact
assemblage, lack of any architectural remains and the gathering of archival and (limited) oral history data
the site is considered to be ineligible for formal state or federal listings.
Site Revisits
One site, 41MI98, was formally reinvestigated, while another, 41MI99 was enlarged due to observations
west of the previously defined boundary (Figure 55). 41MI98 was described as a lithic scatter with stone
tools and flakes across about 250 m of sloping land overlooking a tributary to South Bennett Creek to the
east. The tools consisted of two thin bifaces, a thick biface, and a uniface. Several dozen flakes were
reported. Soils were considered thin and no subsurface testing was done. Although the site form
suggested the site was not eligible for formal SAL listing, the internal report (Hixson 2004, Hixson et. al
2006) indicated it was the only site out of the seven recorded during the project that might contain
“significant” deposits, and it was recommended that any vegetation clearing be done without impacting
root systems. The site was revisited on February 3, 2009. At the west end of the site it was seen to have
almost no soil. Exposed bedrock and caliche was examined and no artifacts were seen. This is the
location of STR 23/2. Structure 23/1 is located 165 m to the east at an elevation about 20 ft lower, where
a low bench is present. No artifacts were seen until this point, where a light scatter of flakes and a thin
biface fragment were seen. The ground sloped once more to the final bench prior to the drop to the creek.
One or two flakes were seen in exposures up to this point. The landform made one final drop to the
creek, the banks of which had been previously examined for artifacts, and none had been encountered.
Four shovel tests, (STs 12-15) were excavated. Three were placed in the vicinity of STR 23/1, which
appeared to be the nucleus of the site, and one on the lower terrace prior to the final drop to the creek.
Tests 12 and 13 were placed on either side of the structure. One had a chert chip and a piece of apparent
fire-cracked limestone. The other had an interior chunk and a small, 15 cm slab of sandstone that was
quite probably a fragment of a metate. Soils consisted of about 20 cm of brown clay loam with increasing
limestone at depth, becoming fragmented and decaying limestone below 25 cm. Test 14 was placed just
to the east and on the north edge of the ROW, near the densest observed surface concentration of artifacts
(five flakes and the edge of a thin biface). This test had one interior chip and a 10 cm diameter firecracked limestone fragment. The final test, ST 15, on the lower terrace, recovered no absolute artifacts,
although one burned and shattered chert fragment and a small fire-cracked piece of limestone were
recovered from the upper 20 cm. The test was excavated to a depth of 50 cm through dark grayish brown
clay loam that became brown clay loam below 18 cm, and had increasing amounts of fragmented
limestone and calcium carbonate nodules with depth. This last was considered an offsite test.

97

Despite the presence of some stone tools and a likely piece of groundstone, this site is considered to be
fully documented within the ROW and not eligible for formal state or federal registers. Should the
transmission line ever be rerouted in the future, then a site revisit would be in order.
41MI99 was a lithic procurement site located on the top of a high lobe rising about 150 ft above the
drainage system to the west (Figure 56). The site consisted of cores, tested cobbles and hard hammer
flakes apparently originating from a chert seam or outcropping about midway up the slope. Artifacts
were seen along the slope and at the edge of the lobe. When investigating the drainage below, a small
amount of similar material was seen at the base of the slop and extending for a distance into the open
pasture to the west. Excellent visibility, obviously shallow soils and the site type precluded the necessity
for shovel testing. As a result the site was extended from its previous plot for a distance of 300 m to the
west. Recommendations remain unchanged, and it is considered ineligible for formal listing on state or
national registers.
Other Areas
Lampasas River: The eastern side of the Lampasas River rises fairly abruptly, with only one structure
(STR 4/1) within a short distance. High probability soils are not mapped on this side of the river. This
was the location of previously recorded site 41LM48, a lithic scatter that was considered to be destroyed.
Four shovel tests were excavated in 2004, and only one was positive. This area was observed from the
opposite side of the river and seen to be a set of rolling hills transitioning to an upland setting. Site
41LM48 was not revisited. On the west side of the river is a broad, 360-m wide floodplain terrace that
contains two structures, STRs 4/2 and 4/3. Subsurface tests (3,4,5) were placed at each structure and at
the edge of a low levee formation on the eastern third of the terrace. All three were negative for cultural
material, and visual inspection of the short-grass pasture also found no artifacts. This terrace is
considered fully investigated in respect to this project.
Bennett Creek: The setting is very similar to the Lampasas River, with quickly rising hills on the east
and a floodplain terrace on the west. Bennett Creek was seen to have very deep fine loams along much of
its length. Previously recorded site 41MI100 was on the eastern side of the creek, and was probably an
open camp (flakes and scattered burned rock, with a Pedernales point) but was considered destroyed
within the ROW. This area was not revisited. Subsurface tests 8 and 9 were placed at each of two
structures (STRs 10/4 and 10/5). Deep soils were encountered, but no artifacts were recovered.
Inspection of the creek cutbank and other exposures likewise found no artifacts. This terrace is
considered fully investigated in respect to this project.

Cub Hollow area: There are mapped soils with possible deep profiles at Cub Hollow and other unnamed
tributaries to Bennett Creek. Four structures (STRs 18/6, 19/1, 19/2, 19/3) each received a subsurface test
(STs 24, 25, 26, 27). No artifacts were recovered or otherwise noted. This area is considered fully
investigated in respect to this project.
STRs 23/6, 23/7: These two structures are both within soils mapped as potentially having some depth
along a small tributary to South Bennett Creek. Tests 10 and 11 were placed at each of these structures.
There was no recovery or other evidence of artifacts, and soils were actually quite shallow. This area is
considered fully investigated in respect to this project.
Previously Recorded Sites Not Yet Discussed
41LM46, 41LM47: These are both lithic procurement sites located less than a kilometer west of Beef Pen
Spring (41LM61) and at or very near STRs 2/6 and 2/7. Both were recorded as fairly low density scatters
98

of typical procurement materials, although a few apparent tools were also at 41LM47. Both were
considered extremely disturbed with little additional research value with the ROW. No further work or
other measures were recommended, and they were considered ineligible for formal listings. These sites
were not revisited.
41MI97: This site is located just west of STRs 26/7 and 26/8 (discussed above). It was recorded as a
lithic procurement site with little additional research value and was considered ineligible for formal
listings. This site was not revisited.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA proposes to rebuild an existing transmission line that runs between the Evant and Goldthwaite
substations in Lampasas and Mills County, and crossing a small portion of Hamilton County. Twelve
archaeological sites are known to exist within the line ROW (Table 1). Seven (41LM46 47, 48 and
41MI87, 98, 99, 100) were recorded during survey in 2004. An additional five sites (41LM61, 41MI109,
110, 111, 112) were recorded during the present survey. All sites are considered to be fully recorded
within the ROW, and none are felt to be eligible for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks or
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. At 41MI109, however, a mounded area
resembling a small burned rock midden is located outside the ROW but within an area of potential effect.
This location is recommended for avoidance by ground disturbing activities. Elsewhere, it is
recommended the project be allowed to proceed, with the understanding that standard emergency
discovery procedures will be in place.

Substation Expansion Project, Travis County, Texas

Management Summary
LCRA proposes to expand its existing Harris Branch substation located in central Travis County, Texas
(Figure 57). The substation will be expanded by 2.11 acres in order to accommodate expanded use
precipitated by the future Clear Springs (Seguin) to Hutto transmission line. This 2.11-acre expansion is
a reduction in scope from an originally proposed 4-acre expansion. The original 4-acre substation
expansion area was surveyed by two members of LCRA Archaeology Services staff on March 18, 2009.
A total of 10 shovel tests was excavated (Figure 58), exceeding the Texas Historical Commission’s
minimum survey standards. No archaeological sites were discovered as a result of the investigation. No
artifacts were collected, and no curation will be necessary. It is recommended the project be allowed to
proceed. Due to the small project area and negative findings, the short report format as suggested by the
Council of Texas Archeologists will be used here.

Study Area
The project area is located in a plowed field in northeastern Travis County, within the Blackland Priarie
vegetation province (Arbingast et al. 1976:13), and on a left bank terrace of Gilleland Creek, a left bank
tributary of the Colorado River. Project area elevation ranges from 585-620 ft msl. Project area soils are
Heiden clays and Houston Black clays. Heiden clays are dark grayish-brown clays over mottled grayish
brown clays which formed on calcareous marl, and are subject to very high shrink-swell potential
(Werchan et al. 1974). Houston Black clays are deep, very dark gray clays which formed over chalk and
marl under tall prairie grasses. These soils overlay the Upper Cretaceous Taylor Marl formation, which is
thick chalk and chalky marl (Fisher 1974). Vegetation in the area is typified by cropland at the juncture
of the Blackland Prairies and the Edwards Plateau (McMahan et al. 1984).

Research Design and Field Methods
The project was designed simply to determine if surficial or buried archaeological materials were present
within the project area, and if so to evaluate their potential for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places or formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark. This was accomplished by a
combination of historic and modern map and file reviews, followed by intensive pedestrian survey and
shovel testing. Both USGS maps and aerial imagery were used, and shovel test locations were recorded
by GPS with an average 2-4 m level of accuracy. A no collection policy was maintained throughout the
project.

Results of Investigations
The map and files review indicated there were no previously recorded archaeological sites within or
immediately adjacent to the project area. The 1896 USGS Austin map shows a structure located about
170 m to the northeast (see Figure 57). The modern quad shows this structure as well as a drive leading
to two unoccupied structures. Aerial imagery indicated that the original substation boundary would be
very close to these last two structures. Upon arriving at the project area the existing survey stakes were
used to establish a line through this area. It was determined the substation (original configuration) would
not impact the buildings. The present configuration is 60 m distant from them. The buildings themselves
were pole barns of relatively recent construction (Figure 59). There was a remarkable lack of artifacts
surrounding these buildings, with only a single fragment of purple glass observed just to the west. This is
considered to be intrusive. Two shovel tests (ST 1, 7) were excavated near these barns, and no artifacts
were recovered.

Elsewhere, occasional prehistoric artifacts were observed, perhaps a total of 10 across the original four
acres. These included a couple of cores and a few large thick flakes. These artifacts are considered to be
scattered individual occurrences (IOs) and have certainly been redistributed by historic ranching and
farming activities. Eight shovel tests were placed across the remainder of the original 4-acre project area,
with a total of five within the revised 2.11 acre location, and a sixth very near its southern edge (see
Figure 2). None encountered artifacts. Each was excavated to a depth of 40 cm through loamy to dense
clays. In some cases a subsoil was encountered, in others not, but given the generally upland, nonaggrading setting, this depth is considered sufficient.
No archaeological sites were recorded as a result of the investigations. The single historic artifact lacks
association with the barns, and the barns themselves, which are well without of the project area,
nonetheless do not appear to be greater than 50 years in age. The extremely light prehistoric lithic scatter
lacks integrity and has no patterning, and likewise is not considered a site.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA proposes to expand its existing Harris Branch substation located in eastern Travis County by 2.11
acres. An intensive cultural resources survey recorded no sites with the project area.
It is recommended the project be allowed to proceed as described.

Substation Project, Kendall County, Texas

Management Summary
The LCRA is planning to build a new electrical substation two miles east of the town of Boerne in
Kendall County. The new facility will be called the Esperanza Substation and will cover approximately
five acres of land that is currently being used as range for cattle (Figure 60, Figure 61). The project is
located in proximity to one of the upper branches of Boerne Creek and therefore has a moderate potential
for prehistoric sites and in particular sites with burned rock middens. Such sites have been recorded on
upland landforms within the county (TARL Kendall County file), and sotol - a plant known to be baked in
earth ovens - grows in the area.
Because of the project area’s potential for sites with burned rock middens, LCRA’s Archeology Services
conducted a field survey of the area to record any sites that might be present and to assess their eligibility
for SAL designation. The survey, which took place on March 31, 2009, found no archeological sites
within the project area.

Environmental Background
Geology
The project is located in an area underlain by Glen Rose limestone, a formation generally devoid of chert
nodules (Barnes 1983). This formation tends to erode in a stair-step fashion creating a series nearly level
benches or terrace-like landforms. The substation will be built on a particularly wide example one of
these terraces that overlooks the tributary drainage of Boerne Creek. The east edge of this terrace drops
off to a second, more narrow terrace before the final drop to the valley floor through which the tributary
runs in a northeast to southwest direction.
Soils
The limestone bedrock is thinly covered by soils belonging to the Doss-Brackett association (Dittemore
1981). The two principal soils of this association are similar in that they have a dark grayish brown
surface horizon over a lighter colored lower zone the overlies the bedrock.
Vegetation
The vegetation at present resembles a park with patches of live oaks amid expanses of grassland. Within
the project bounds there is approximately a 30 percent canopy cover with most of the trees being large
live oaks and small cedars. Also present in smaller number is Texas oak. Understory plants include
persimmon, agarita, and prickly pear. Most of the trees grow on the north and west edges of the terrace
while the terrace surface has been cleared of smaller tree species. Two large “drag piles” lie near the
center of the open area, evidence of the use of heavy machinery to uproot trees (Figure 62). Shallow
limestone is commonly exposed (Figure 63).

Cultural Background
Prehistoric Background
The project area lies in the northwest corner of the Central Texas Archeological Region, as defined by
Prewitt (1981). The concept of an “archeological region” developed at a time (1950s and 1960s) when
most Texas archaeologists held the normative view that a culture was defined by a series of shared traits.

In parts of Texas where hunter-gatherers were thought to have lived, the traits that concerned
archaeologists most were projectile point forms followed by site types and cooking features. Later, in the
1960s and 1970s, many processual archaeologists argued that culture operated as a system that allowed a
population to adapt to its environment. Since Central Texas is an environmentally diverse region, many
different cultural systems must have operated in the past. The population in the Mesquite Plains would
have had a different adaptation than one that included the Balcones Canyonlands in their interactive
sphere. With little ethnographic data on the indigenous population of the region, research in recent
decades has focused on cultural ecology and the materialist aspects of culture, including lithic technology
(e.g. Goode in Malof et al. 2007), cooking technology (Black et al. 1997), and subsistence (Derring in
Collins et al. 1997), which can to some degree be understood using branches of the “hard” sciences.
Chronological frameworks for Central Texas have been proposed by researchers over the years, with the
one most prevalently in use being that of Johnson and Goode (1992). As with all such frameworks for the
region, projectile point forms are used as time markers to recognize various time periods and subperiods.

Historic Background
Lipan, Apache, and Comanche were the dominant groups of Native Americans in the late eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries and were present when Germans began settling the area in the 1840’s. The
Meusebach-Comanche Treaty, signed in 1847, permitted the German settlers to settle Indian territory and
the Indians to enter their settlements. Although relations between the Indians and settlers were fair,
Indians did make frequent raids on farms in the area, and in some instants killed settlers and stole
children. The threat of raids continued through the mid-1870s but lessened as the frontier was pushed
farther west (Smyrl 2002).
The German settlers established the town of Tusculum in 1849, later to be changed to Boerne in 1852
when Gustav Theissen and John James laid out the town site and changed the name in honor of Ludwig
Boerne, a German author and publicist. Boerne had only a few homes when it was chosen as county seat
after Kendall County was established in 1862, named after George Wilkins Kendall. The major issue at
the time of the county’s formation was the Civil War. The residents of Kendall County opposed
secession. The level on Unionist sentiment was due to the number of German immigrants, most of whom
opposed slavery and secession. A company of men from Kendall County fought for the Union at the
battle of Nueces. Kendall County, like most areas in the South, suffered economic hardship following the
Civil War. The county did not begin to show signs of recovery until the 1880s (Smyrl 2002).

130

Field crops such as corn, wheat, oats, and cotton were the main sources of agricultural income for the
residents of Kendall County. While sheep ranching, established by George W. Kendall in the 1850s,
became the county’s principle industry. By 1900 the population of the county had increased and the ethic
makeup changed. New immigrants arrived from England in the 1880s and 1890s and from Mexico after
the turn of the century. However, Kendall County retains much of it German heritage (Smyrl 2002).
Previous Investigations
As of April, 2009, 208 archeological sites have been recorded in Kendall County, most during small-scale
surveys conducted by an assortment of cultural resource firms as well as by avocational groups, especially
the South Texas Archeological Society. Nearly all of these sites represent prehistoric campsites, lithic
scatters, and burned rock middens. Burned rock middens sites are especially common in the county and
many were recorded by amateur archeologists in 1960s. CRM surveys resulted in the recording of a large
number of upland lithic scatters and lithic procurement locales. At least one sinkhole site with multiple
burials is known but considering the geology of the county many more of these sites probably exist. Few
excavations have taken place in the county and only one, the Ammans Crossing Site (41KE93), has been
published (Young 1987). This site was excavated by the Texas State Department of Highways and Public
Transportation (now Texas Department of Transportation) in 1985 to mitigate the rerouting of a farm-tomarket road. Although partially exposed rock hearths were visible before excavation, the deposits
proved to be shallow and disturbed by erosion. Ammans Crossing dates to the Late Archaic I and II,
based on projectile point styles.
In February of 2005, LCRA’s Archeology Services surveyed the site of the proposed Hill Country
Substation along with Segments and B of the proposed T-244 Transmission Line. Three new prehistoric
sites were recorded during the survey, all surface lithic scatters on elevated upland landforms overlooking
small dry drainages feeding Menger Creek. These were evaluated as having a low information yield and
none were considered SAL-eligible. The same year, two linear cultural resource surveys were conducted
along Transmission Line T-459 prior to a proposed rebuild. The route south of the Cisco Substation,
which includes the point where the proposed T-244 line will connect, was surveyed by LCRA’s
archeological Services staff.
Recently burial cairns have been identified at 41KE191 in the southwest corner of the county. Such
features have previously been regarded as rock piles left behind by field clearing but limited excavation
has shown that the piles cover a pit outlined in the soil (Shafer 2009).
Research Design and Methods
The survey involved a walk-over of the entire project area by a two man crew. All surface finds were
marked with flagging tape and their positions recorded by GPS. In addition, a total of ten shovel tests
were placed at regular intervals across the project area, avoiding areas near rock outcrops where soil
cover was obviously thin (Figure 63, also see Figure 61). The number was chosen to comply with the
THC’s minimum number of shovels test for a project. Each test was dug to bedrock or a depth of at least
50 cm. This depth was deemed sufficient to recover cultural material since no alluvium or deep
colluvium is present within the confines of the project.
Results of Investigations
The field survey found the project area generally devoid of artifacts, either ancient or modern. A recent
spray paint can was the only artifact found within the bounds of the project. One half of a commerciallymade brick was found immediately outside the northeast corner of the project area approximately 30
meters west of the road. The project area near this find was carefully inspected and no other artifacts
131

were found. No shovel testing was attempted because of the thin soil cover and rock outcropping. This
brick appears to be an isolated artifact.
No artifacts were recovered from the ten shovel tests dug during the survey. Limestone bedrock was
encountered at various depths between 12 and 31cm in six of the shovel tests; the other tests were stopped
at depths of 50 or 60cm in the lighter-colored lower soil zone.

Summary and Recommendations
An intensive archeological survey was conduced in a five acre area where the LCRA plans to build a new
electrical substation. No sites were recorded and no cultural materials were seen other than a couple of
isolated modern artifacts, one of which was immediately outside the project area. Since no archeological
sites will be impacted by construct of the substation, the project should be allowed to proceed as currently
planned.
As always, standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable to this project. Should the
construction personnel uncover any presently unknown buried archeological features during construction
work, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archeology Services
staff should be notified at 1-800-776-5272, ext. 6714 so that the find can be assessed in consultation with
the THC. In such a situation, work can continue in other areas where no archeological materials are
present.

River Nature Park Perimeter Fence Replacement Project, Blanco County, Texas

Management Summary
136

The LCRA plans to replace the existing property fence along the perimeter of their Pedernales River
Nature Park located on the northeastern edge of Johnson City in Blanco County. The new fence, a
standard ranch type high tensile wire fence, will run for a total distance of 3800 meters along the east,
south, and west boundaries of the park. The land fronting the Pedernales River on the north side of the
park will not be fenced. The existing fence posts will be removed by being pulled straight up with a skid
steer bucket. The new fence will be constructed using 2 3/8”or 2 7/8” steel pipes driven into the ground
at 100’ intervals. T-posts will be inserted into the ground at 10 meter intervals between the pipe posts.
Both the pipes and T-posts will be driven into the ground using a mechanical hammer.
A 16-foot-wide strip of land along the interior side of the fence will be cleared of brush and small trees to
allow access for the machinery and to serve as a firebreak once fence construction is completed. Most of
the clearing will be done using a Sepie mulcher although small areas will be cleared with mechanical
shears or by hand. Large trees will not be removed and will continue growing within the proposed
firebreak zone.
An intensive archeological survey of the project area was conducted by LCRA’s Archeology Services
staff on April 16 and May 15 of 2009. During the survey three prehistoric sites were recorded: 41BC153,
41BC154, and 41BC155 (Figure 64). Two of the sites, 41BC153 and 41BC154 were found to contain
buried cultural material, including layers of fire-cracked rocks probably representing hearths. Both sites
may contain information of value to future research and are potentially eligible for SAL designation,
however further investigation will be needed to ascertain the integrity of their deposits. The third site,
41BC155, is a disturbed lithic scatter that is not considered SAL-eligible. To avoid impacting 41BC153
and 41BC154, clearing will be done by hand or with the Sepie mulcher within the boundaries of these
sites. Furthermore, pipe posts will not be placed in areas of these sites that contain buried deposits.
Instead, T-posts alone will be used in those areas to support the fence.

Environmental Background
Geology
The park is underlain by limestone and dolomite belonging to the Gorman formation of the Ellenburger
group (Barnes 1981). These rocks are lower Ordovician in age. Although these rocks are cherty, the
material is too small and fragmented to have been an important material for making stone tools. Chert
more suitable for knapping is available as transported cobbles in the bed of the Pedernales River.
Cretaceous-age Glen Rose limestone and Hensell sand have been mapped along the south edge of the
park. These younger rocks overly the Gorman formation and probably outcrop on the low ridgetops that
trend northeastwards towards the river.
What appears to be geologically recent silt and sand deposits are found along the banks of the river
extending inland in places for no more than 30 meters. These sediments rest on limestone bedrock and do
not appear to contain prehistoric cultural material. Small areas of older alluvial deposits may be present
along the river as evidenced in the cutbank of Town Creek near its mouth at the Pedernales River.
Soils
Three soil associations have been mapped within the park boundaries (Dittermore and Allison 1979). All
are considered upland soils. The most widespread is the Tarpley association, covering well over 90% of

the park area. These thin soils developed on the limestone bedrock into two distinct soil horizons: an
upper, 8 inch thick horizon of reddish gray stony clay over a 7 inch thick horizon of red clay. Beneath
this second horizon is fractured limestone bedrock. Krum association soils are found in the low-lying
areas near the main entrance at the west end of the park. These soils typically develop at the base of
slopes from ancient clays. Krum soils have a surface zone of dark to very dark grayish brown clay 17
inches thick over brown clay with calcium carbonate nodules in the upper part of this zone. Eckrant-Rock
outcrop association is found at the northwest corner of the park close to the river. These soils are very
shallow and are composed of very dark gray cobbly clay 11 inches thick over limestone.
Vegetation
The low ridges in the upland portion of the park are covered by an oak/juniper woods with frequent small
clearings. Cactus and yucca thrive on the rocky slope and other areas were the soil is thin, especially in
the southeast corner of the park.. On the western edge of the park and on the terraces fronting the river,
much of the woody vegetation has been cleared by previous owners. The ground in this area appears to
have been bladed and contoured to some degree, leaving only the larger trees, mostly live oaks in upland
areas, and ash and bois d’arc along the Pedernales River and Town Creek, the only perennial stream
running through the park.

Cultural Background
Prehistoric Background
The project area lies in the central part of the Central Texas Archeological Region, as defined by Prewitt
(1981). The concept of an “archeological region” developed at a time (1950s and 1960s) when most

Chronological frameworks for Central Texas have been proposed by researchers over the years, with the
one most commonly in use these days being that of Johnson and Goode (1992) with modifications by
Collins (1998). As with all such frameworks for the region, projectile point forms are used as time
markers within various time periods and subperiods.
Historic Background
During the mid 18th century, Spanish prospectors used a trail that ran due north from San Antonio to reach
the Los Almagres mine on the southern edge of the Llano Uplift region. In February 1756, Miranda y
Flores, a military officer on his way to investigate the validity of the mines, camped on the Pedernales
River not far from present-day Johnson City (Patten 1970). Miranda’s party included an Apache
interpreter since the area north and west of San Antonio at that time was part of Apacheria. Later,
Comanche groups laid claim to the area.
The area that became Blanco County remained unsettled by people of European descent until 1850s.
James Callahan, Eli Hinds, and Joseph Bird were among the earliest settlers (Bigham 2008). Bird
established the community that later became Round Mountain.
The first settlements along the Blanco River were established in the early 1850s and a few years later the
town of Pittsburgh was laid out on the south side of the river. When Blanco County was established in
1858 a new town by the same name was founded as the county seat on the north side of the river opposite
Pittsburgh. In the 1870s, homesteaders living along the Pedernales River began petitioning the county to
move the courthouse closer to the geographic center of the county (Ogilvie 2008). Part of this effort
involved establishing a new community on the Pedernales River. The new town was named Johnson City
after James Polk Johnson one of the movement’s leaders. In 1890, an election made Johnson City the
county seat.
Previous Investigations
No known archeological work has been done within the current project prior to LCRA’s purchase of the
park in 2008. As of the writing of this report, 155 archeological sites have been recorded in Blanco
County. A good portion of these – 62 sites - were recorded during surveys within the boundaries of
Pedernales Falls State Park, including ones by the Travis County Archeological Society in 1962-1963 and
139

by Texas Parks and Wildlife archeologists in 1970, 1989, and 1996 (Howard 2003). These surveys took
place on the portion of the park that lies south of the Pedernales River, an area environmentally similar to
the Pedernales River Nature Park. Different limestone formations and more numerous drainages have
created steeper slopes with numerous overhangs and shelters, features that are mostly absent in the LCRA
Park. Sixteen of the Pedernales Falls State Park’s sites or 26 percent of all the recorded sites have been
recommended for SAL designation. These include such prehistoric site types as rockshelters, open
campsites, terrace sites, burned rock middens, and one lithic procurement site. In addition two Historic
farmsteads dating to the 1800s were recommended for SAL designation.
One of the most investigated sites in the Pedernales Falls State Park is the Wheatley Site, 41BC114
(Greer 1976). The site is located in an upland context and cultural deposits there are confined to the
surface or near surface. It was considered significant because most of the artifacts, including over a
thousand bone-tempered potsherds, belong to the Toyah interval. The fieldwork consisted in intensive
surface collecting and stripping of surface soil layer to recovered buried artifacts.
Site 41BC1, the only rock art site recorded in Blanco County is located on private land near the
Pedernales Fall State Park ( Brock et al. 2006 ). It contains approximately 25 pictographs on the walls of
a small cave fronting the river. The pictographs include depictions of a bison, human or human-like
figures, geometric designs, and at least one example of Historic graffiti perhaps dating to the 19th century.
A small portion of the remains of one of the pictographs mostly destroyed by spalling was radiocarbon
dated to Cal. A.D. 1160-1310 (2 sigma), approximately the period when bison reentered the region and
the beginning of the Toyah interval.
The Sleeper site, 41BT65 is located on a permanent tributary of Sandy Creek northwest of the project area
(Johnson 1991). The portion of the site within the highway ROW was excavated by the Texas State
Department of Highways and Public Transportation in the 1970s. Remains of an Early Archaic camp
including burned rock cooking features and milling equipment were uncovered in the moderately deep
alluvial deposits along the creek.

Research Design and Methods
The purpose of the survey was to locate archeological sites that could be impacted by the fence
construction and firebreak clearing and to assess their eligibility for SAL designation. The investigation
consisted of a pedestrian survey with shovel testing. For the pedestrian survey, two archaeologists spaced
approximately 10 feet apart walked within the proposed firebreak zone parallel to the existing property
fence. Shovel tests were placed in areas where surface visibility was poor and soil depth permitted.
Shovel tests were also placed to establish limits of buried archeological sites. A total of 16 shovel tests
were dug during the survey (Figure 65). This number is less than the 38 tests required under the THC’s
Minimum Survey Standards for a linear project of this length. However, most of the project’s length approximately 2100 meters - runs across low, rocky ridges with little soil cover and good surface
visibility, areas that could not conceal buried cultural deposits. In addition, another 300-meter segment
runs across a landfill located in the salient on the west side of park. In all, a total length of 1400 meters
required subsurface testing.
The tests were dug to a depth of at least 80cm or to bedrock or the B-horizon of upland soils. In one case
(ST 15) the test was ended when the top of a buried hearth was encountered. Once a site was identified,
its investigation continued onto LCRA land outside the project area in order to get a better understanding
of the site’s extent.

All artifacts recovered from shovel testing were returned to the test hole during refilling. The one
exception to this policy was the shovel test recovery from Site 41BC155 which was collected and
analyzed in the lab. Surface diagnostic artifacts were also collected. All the artifacts collected during this
project will be curated at the Texas Archeological Laboratory (TARL).

Results of Investigations
Three sites, 41BC153-155 were recorded during the survey (see Figure 64). Two sites, 41BC153 and
41BC154, were located on terraces along the river while the third site was located on an upland slope
facing a tributary creek (see Figure 65). Artifacts recovery from shovel tests is listed in the Appendix
along with soil profiles.
41BC153
Site 41BC153 is a prehistoric terrace site located at the confluence of a small unnamed creek and the
Pedernales River (Figure 66). A large portion of the site area lies outside LCRA property to the west,
including a burned rock midden whose eastern edge is only 6 meters from the property line. The cultural
material on the LCRA property is largely buried and potentially significant.

The LCRA portion of the site slopes down from the upland edge to the river in several narrow, sandy
benches. It is cut off from the rest of the park by a narrow stream channel, which has been dammed
immediately upstream from the site. Because of its isolation, this area has escaped the disturbances from
development by previous owners that are evident in the rest of the park area close to the river. Most of
site area is wooded, with cedars on the upper terrace and pecans, elms, and chinaberry on the lower
terrace.
Although vandalism in the form of several pits was visible in the midden area on the adjacent property, no
signs of looting were seen on LCRA property. One shovel test (ST 14) placed on the western edge of the
LCRA property closest to the midden recovered moderate to high amounts of debitage and fire-cracked
rocks down to 80cm where a layer of rock was encountered. This rock could be bedrock or, less likely, a
142

buried burned rock feature. Another test placed to the north on a lower bench-like surface encountered a
layer of fire-cracked rock at 30 cm below surface; the test ended at this depth to avoid damaging the
feature. A third test place farther north on the lowest terrace recovered no artifacts and the sediments
there appear to be geologically recent.
The LCRA-owned portion of 41BC153 is potentially eligible for SAL listing. It contains buried features
and archeological deposits down to at least 80 cm. How well this material is stratified has not been
determined nor has the horizontal extent of buried cultural material eastwards towards the river.
41BC154
Site 41BC153 is prehistoric site with burned rocks and lithics located at the northeast corner of the
property on the south bank of the Pedernales River (Figure 67, Figure 68). A paved parking lot and
picnic area constructed by the land development company that previously owned the property is located
just west of the project area. The site area extends from the higher of two terraces facing the river
southwards (or inland) over a low ridge to a dry tributary branch that joins Deer Creek a short distance
east of the perimeter fence. Although the area outside the park was not investigated, the site no doubt
continues to the east, perhaps covering entire point formed by the river and Deer Creek. The paved
parking area situated on the divide between the two streams has obliterated a substantial portion of the
site, effectively dividing it within the park into two parts, one facing the Pedernales River and the other
facing the tributary branch of Deer Creek.
Weak terrace formation is apparent on the slope facing the river; with a lower terrace bench probably
composed of recently deposited sands and an upper terrace that probably merged with the ridge top before
construction of the parking lot (Figure 5). On these terraces grow large pecans, live oaks, and a few

American elms. Understory woody vegetation was probably cleared with the construction of park
facilities by previous owners at this spot during the 1980s. This portion of the site appears to have been
spared the extensive grading seen elsewhere in the park and is covered by lush grass and forbs. South of
the parking lot the vegetation is noticeably sparser and more xeric, with stunted live oaks, cactus, and
agarita. Use of heavy machinery for past clearing is evident in the presence of old push or burn piles and
the disturbed upper soil zone encountered in shovel tests.
A variety of upland soils of the Tarpley association are present, formed from the underlying limestone
bedrock. These are made up of clay or clay loams, often stony, although sandy loams, such as the
Pedernales soils can be found. Shovel testing near the top of the slope facing the river encountered what
appears to be a Tarpley soil in that it has a grayish brown clay surface zone overlying reddish brown clay.
South of the parking area, the soils were noticeably lighter in color and composed entirely of loam.
In the site area between the river and parking lot, cultural material – mostly fire-cracked limestone rocks was visible only in the gully that runs along the eastern perimeter fence and in an animal burrow backdirt
pile on the west side of the slope outside the project area. A Pedernales point was found at the upper end
of the gully close to the parking area. Apparently all this material was dislodged from buried cultural
deposits – more evidence of this component comes from a shovel test placed in the narrow strip of
144

undisturbed ground between the fence and gully close to where the projectile point was found. This test
encountered a layer of fire-cracked rock resting at 30 cm below surface. Two flakes were also found at
the same approximate depth. Two tests were placed in the sands that lie along the riverbank. Both tests
were dug to a depth of 80 cm and failed to recover artifacts other than one item of modern trash between
40 and 60 cm.
South of the parking lot, ground visibility is much better and more artifacts can be seen on the surface. A
medial section of a Stage 2 biface was found along with a very light scatter of debitage. Also a few
limestone rocks appeared heat-fractured but may have originated from recent burn piles. A shovel test
recovered one piece of debitage and a fire-cracked rock in the upper 40 cm of soil.
Site 41BC154 contains buried burned rock and lithics recovered through shovel testing or observed in
eroded areas. A Pedernales point found in a small gulley shows that the site was visited at least once
during the early part of the Late Archaic but considering the site’s location at the confluence two
perennial streams one would predict that the area saw multiple occupations. Still the lack of large
amounts of cultural debris on the relatively stable landform suggests the area was not especially favorable
as a campsite for foragers. Denser cultural material could still be buried especially on the slope facing the
river.
More testing will be needed to ascertain the integrity of the buried component in the upper terrace north
of the parking lot. Because of the slope grade, these deposits could conceivably have been redeposited or
at least have experienced some downslope movement. In addition, the full extent of the disturbances –
apart from the obvious ones such as the parking lot - caused by past development of the area is yet to be
determined. Since the potential exists for buried cultural deposits, ground disturbing construction should
be avoided in the site area until more investigation is done.
41BC155
This site is a much-disturbed prehistoric lithic scatter located just within the Park’s entrance between the
swimming pool complex built by the former owners and the entrance gate (Figure 69). The known site
area is bisected a little south of center by the main park road and has been cleared of most of the trees and
brush (Figure 70). Shovel testing along the fenceline north of the park road recovered moderate amounts
of debitage in the upper 30 cm of soil above the red clay B horizon. The soil also contained modern trash
and numerous rock fragments indicating that the upper soil zone has been disturbed.
The ground south of the project area was also inspected. A few pieces of chert debitage were seen in bare
patches amid the grass between the fenceline southwards for a distance of approximately 80 meters. A
low-lying area or swale appears to form the southern limits of the site. Artifacts were observed eastwards
up to the swimming pool complex and westwards to the fenceline that includes the entrance gate. The
site probably continues some distance to the north of the property line towards Town Creek.
Because the portion of the site on LCRA property contains shallow, disturbed cultural deposits it is not
recommended for SAL designation.

Summary and Recommendations
Two of the three sites recorded during this project, 41BC153 and 41BC154, are potentially eligible for
State Archeological Landmark designation. Both are known to contain buried hearths or hearth-like
features and other cultural material. To avoid impacting these sites, all clearing will be done by hand or
with a Sepie mulcher. Pipe posts will not be used in areas of these sites with buried cultural material.
Instead, the fence in these areas will be supported only by T-posts, the placement of which will cause
little harm. The third site recorded during the survey, 41BC155, is a disturbed lithic scatter that is not
considered SAL-eligible and no avoidance measures need to be taken.
As always, standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable to this project. Should the
construction personnel uncover any presently unknown buried archeological features during clearing or
fence construction, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA
Archeology Services staff should be notified so that the find can be assessed in consultation with the THC.
In such a situation, work can continue in other areas where no archeological materials are present.

Addendum
On October 6, 2009, three additional shovel tests (ST44-46) were dug at 41BC154 to clarify the depth and
horizontal extent of the cultural deposits (see Appendix). ST44 was placed two meters west of the gully
that runs close to the east property fence and approximately 50 meters south of the river. A Nolan point
(c 2500 BC) came from a depth of between 20 and 40 cm, and below that, between 40 and 50 cm, a zone
of burned rocks was encountered. The point will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Library
(TARL). ST45 was placed 27 meters west of ST44 and reached a depth of 70cm before striking bedrock.
A flake in Level 1 (0-20 cm) was the only obvious artifact recovered although 16 unmodified rocks were
encountered from 40 to 70 cm, ST46, placed 10 meters north of ST45, encountered a possible burned
rock feature at 60 to 67 cm. A lead bullet and a flake were recovered from the level (40 to 60cm) above
this possible feature. These findings show that most of the terrace area at 41BC154 north of the parking
lot contains cultural deposits with possible hearth features down to a depth of at least 70cm and support
its eligibility for SAL designation.
Two other sites were recorded outside the Fence Replacement project area. Both are located in the northcentral part of the park at the base of one of the ridges that form the southern valley wall of the river
(Figure 71).
41BC156
This site is a lithic scatter spread across the surface of a wide rocky shelf that separates the upland ridges
from the narrow floodplain of the Pedernales River. A thin layer of soil covers the shelf with frequent
rock outcropping. The cedar woods of the ridge extend down into the south end of the site but the
northern two-thirds of the site – the part north of the park road – is mostly open with scatted brush and
trees. This area was probably cleared in the past, perhaps first for ranching and then for the earlier park.
The cultural material consists mostly of chert debitage, which appears densest along the south edge of the
site. A shovel test placed in this area recovered no artifacts and struck bedrock a few centimeters below
the surface. Soils in the area are obviously shallow and unlikely to harbor substantial cultural deposits.
Therefore surface debitage density is probably a good reflection of the subsurface density.
Two projectile points were collected from the surface, both found a short distance south of the road. One
of these is the proximal half of a Castroville point (c 500 BC) and the other a more or less complete arrow
point that has a short, constricting stem. It appears to be an unfinished Perdiz point (AD 1300 to AD
1650). These projectile points will be curated at TARL.
The cultural material in this site is mainly confined to the surface and consists of low-density debitage
and a few broken or unfinished stone tools. The site has little research potential beyond its recording for
prehistoric land-use patterns.

41BC157
This site is a small lithic scatter dating to the Austin interval. It is located 100 meters west of 41BC156
and 20 meters south of the park road. The cultural material was found on the surface at the edge of the
cedar woods at the base of the slope leading up the northwest side of the ridge. Fifty meters to the west of
the site runs a shallow drainage or wash which enters Town Creek a short distance from its confluence
with the Pedernales River.

152

Artifacts at this site are sparse, consisting of the stem from a Scallorn arrow point, an arrow point
perform, and four flakes. The arrow point and perform will be curated at TARL. Soils in the area are
shallow with frequent outcrops and therefore shovel testing was not attempted. It is unlikely that these
soils harbor significant numbers of artifacts.
The site is similar to 41BC156 in content and density but covers a much smaller area. It could very well
represent the lithic debris produced during a single event dating to the Austin interval (AD 900 to AD
1400) in contrast to 41BC156 which developed through multiple visits. Site 41BC157 is considered fully
recorded and along with 41BC156 provides data on prehistoric land-use patterns along the Pedernales
River.

Management Summary
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) plans to clear brush this summer in portions of the Cedar
Point Recreation Area on Lake Buchanan in Llano County (Figure 72, Figure 73, Figure 74).
Specifically, LCRA’s initial plan called for using a bulldozer to clear brush in Tract BW-33, which covers
an approximately 110 acre area. The proposed use of a bulldozer to uproot vegetation can potentially
cause severe impacts to any archeological sites that might be present in the project area.
Tract BW-33 was previously surveyed for cultural resources 1979 by Prewitt and Associates for an earlier
round of brush clearing by LCRA. The 1979 survey identified no sites within the tract. However as was
standard methodology at the time, the survey relied completely on surface inspection without shovel
testing. Since buried cultural deposits could be present in the project area, LCRA’s Archeology Services
staff conducted a new intensive survey with shovel testing on April 24, April 30, and May 1, 2009 to
locate any unrecorded sites and assess their eligibility for State Archeological Landmark (SAL)
designation. The total area actually surveyed amounted to 85 acres since only areas with a high and
moderate probabilities for archeological sites were investigated.
During the survey six new archeological sites were recorded and the boundaries of a previously recorded
site, 41LL354, were extended south of Ranch-to-Market (RM) Road 3014 into the project area. Two of
the new sites, 41LL484 and 41LL485, and the extension of 41LL354, have buried deposits that
potentially meet the criteria for SAL designation. The LCRA Conservation Services staff has agreed to
not use a bulldozer for brush clearing within and near these three sites. Instead, any work within these
sites will be done with a Seppi mulcher to avoid any disturbances to subsurface deposits. The other four
sites, 41LL481-483 and 41LL486 are assessed as not eligible for formal designation as SALs.
All artifacts collected along with notes and other project records will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory.

Environmental Background
Geology
The entire project area is underlain by Town Mountain granite, formed over a billion years ago during the
Precambrian (Barnes 1981). Little solid bedrock is exposed in the project area, having weathered into
thick beds of partially decomposed granite called grus. Solid granite is only seen in the creek beds of
some or the more deeply incised drainages, probably recently exposed since bedrock cultural features
such as metates or mortars are absent even on bedrock exposures adjacent to prehistoric campsites.
The topography consists of a series on low ridges sloping moderately towards the drainages. Close to the
creek channels the ground is nearly level and composed of gravelly colluvium, whereas the channels
themselves have cut up to six feet or more into the grus with nearly perpendicular banks.
Soils
Four soils series have been mapped in the project area: Lou, Keese, Voca, and Click (Goerdel 2000) and a
fourth should probably be added as well, Bauman soils along the drainages. These are all upland soils that
formed from granitic parent material. Click, Lou, and Voca soils are the most common, all having
formed on granite grus. They share a catena relationship with their differences in soil profile resulting
from their respective positions on slopes. The Click soils occupy convex ridgetops and slopes, the Lou
soils occupy ridges and side slopes, and the Voca soils are on foot slopes. All three soils have gravelly

sandy loam surface and subsurface layers that combined are between 11 and 14 inches thick. Click and
Lou soils have loam and clay loam subsoils; Voca soils have a reddish brown gravelly clay subsoil.
Keese soils are located on the ridgetops at the south end of the project area. Unlike the soils discussed
above, Keese soils develop in a more stony environment directly on the weathered granite surface or on a
thin layer of grus. Their archeological significance lies in the fact that they are a potential source of
cooking rocks for hearths and ovens in an area generally devoid of large rocks. Keese soils are shallow –
generally 30cm in thickness over the weathered granite.
What appears to be Bauman soils were encountered in shovel tests placed close to the creek channels.
This type of soil develops on granite gravel colluvium that accumulates along drainages. They are
composed of clay loams and are up to 100 cm thick. Such soils could potentially contain buried
archeological deposits.
Physiography and Landforms
The project area is located in the Llano Uplift physiographic region (Bureau of Economic Geology 1977),
a region also known as the Central Texas Mineral Region (Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs
1978). The bedrock geology is made up of granites and various metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.
Topographically, the region is basin, eroding faster than the surround limestones of the Edward Plateau.
The region has its origins in ancient geologic uplifts. Since the Precambrian, the earth’s crest at this
location has been thickened and also lighter in mass than the surrounding rocks, thus elevating the region
(Reed n.d.).
Vegetation
The plant community normally associated with the granite areas of the Llano Uplift is an open savanna or
park grassland (McMahan et al. 1984). Common trees in the region include live oak, blackjack oak, and
mesquite. The project area contains all these tree species but cedar appears to be present in the largest
numbers, perhaps encouraged by frequent brush clearings. The remains of push piles – low mounds
where brush and soil attached to roots were pushed into piles for burning - are numerous in the project
area (Figure 75). These piles may date back to the 1980 brush clearing project that was surveyed by
Prewitt and Associates (Prewitt and Kotter 1980).
Along the streams the tree canopy is continuous forming a dry woods of cedar, oak, cedar elms, and
hackberry. Common understory plants include prickly pear, tasajillo, persimmon, and agarita. An eight
acre landfill that LCRA previously leased to Llano County is located north of Cowan Creek. It has been
capped with earth and appears as a large rectangular field.

Cultural Background
Prehistoric Background
The project area lies in the center of the Central Texas Archeological Region, as defined by Prewitt
(1981). The concept of an “archeological region” developed at a time (1950s and 1960s) when most
Texas archaeologists held the normative view that a culture was defined by a series of shared traits. In
part of Texas where hunter-gatherers were thought to have lived, the traits that concerned archaeologists
the most were projectile point forms followed by site types and cooking features. Later, in the 1960s and
1970s, many processual archaeologists argued that culture operated as a system that allowed a population
159

Figure 75. View of old brush pile in the project area.

to adapt to its environment. Since Central Texas is an environmentally diverse region, many different
cultural systems must have operated in the past. The population in the Llano Uplift would have had a
different adaptation than one that included the Blackland Prairie in their interactive sphere. With little
ethnographic data on the indigenous population of the region, research in recent decades has focused on
cultural ecology and the materialist aspects of culture, including lithic technology (e.g. Goode in Malof et
al. 2007), cooking technology (Black et al. 1997), and subsistence (Derring in Collins et al. 1997), which
can, to some degree, be understood using the “hard” sciences.
Chronological frameworks for Central Texas have been proposed by researchers over the years, with the
one most commonly in use these days being that of Johnson and Goode (1992) with modifications by
Collins (1998). As with all such frameworks for the region, projectile point forms are used as time
markers within various time periods and subperiods.
Historic Background
In the early 1700s, the area of Texas north and west of the Balcones Escarpment was known to the
Spanish as Apacheria – the land of the Apache people. Hostile relations with the Indians discouraged the
Spanish from exploring the area until the 1730s when the first military expeditions against the Apache
camps on the San Saba passed through portions of the eastern Edwards Plateau and the Llano Uplift
(Freeman 2001). The discovery of the mineral wealth of the Llano Uplift and possible deposits of silver
ore led to more official explorations, such as those undertaken by Miranda Y Flores in 1756. Miranda
visited a place called Cerro de Almagres near present day Honey Creek in Llano County and took ore
samples that were later assayed in Mexico and found to be worthless (Patten 1970). Despite the
160

unpromising nature of the mineral deposits, Spanish officials like Diego Ortiz Parrilla as well as
independent citizens of San Antonio de Bexar continued to prospect for silver at Cerro de Almagre and
other sites in the Llano Uplift. Political unrest in Spanish Texas at the beginning of the 19th century
diverted attention away from the Llano Uplift with its illusive mineral wealth.
Germans emigrants began establishing settlements along the Llano River in late 1840s after John O.
Meusebach negotiated a peace treaty with the Comanches (Speck 2002). Somewhat later in the early
1850s, Anglo settlers crossed the Colorado River to settle Tow Valley and Bluffton, places that are today
under the waters of Lake Buchanan. The first of these settlers were surveyor David Cowan and his
brother Gideon who crossed the Colorado River to established a saltworks at a salt spring that is now
under water just south of the southern tip of Paradise Point. David Cowan was surveying land along the
Colorado when he learned about the salt spring from Tonkawa Indians who had recently been relocated to
creek west of Fort Croghan (Yarbrough 1990?). The stream where he first met the Tonkawa came to be
known as Council Creek.
Early settlement west of the river centered around the Cowan Saltworks, which employed many of the
newcomers while they waited to acquire land for farming (Yarbrough 1990?). Llano County was
established in 1856, but population and economic growth was slow, especially in the period immediately
after the Civil War. Ranching and farming were the main economic pursuits but iron ore mining brought
a short-lived economic boom to the county in the late 1800s (Speck 2002). During this boom period the
Austin and Northwestern Railroad extended their lines into the county, allowing quarried granite to be
freighted to distant city and port destinations.
Beginning in the 1930s, a series of dams were built along the Hill Country stretch of the Colorado River
to control flooding and produce hydroelectric power for rural communities. Buchanan Dam was the first
of these to be completed. It had originally been started by private companies but their collapse during the
Depression ended construction in 1932 when only 40 percent of dam had been built (Yarbrough 1990?).
Many of the workers continued to live at the construction camps along the river in the vicinity of the dam
in the hope that the project would eventually resume. Construction did not begin again until four years
later when the state of Texas created the Lower Colorado River Authority, a non-profit agency which
could receive and administer the federal funds needed to complete the project. Buchanan Dam was
completed in less than a year and began impounding the flow of the Colorado River on May 20, 1937.

Previous Investigations
At the present time, 480 archeological sites have been recorded in Llano County (TARL files). A
significant number of these are located beneath the waters of Lake Buchanan, having been discovered
during a 1937 reconnaissance by A.T. Jackson before the flow of the Colorado River was impounded by
the completion of Hamilton Dam, later renamed Buchanan Dam (Jackson 1938). Jackson’s
reconnaissance and his subsequent excavations with Arthur M. Woolsey were part of a salvage effort
initiated by J. E. Pearce of the University of Texas and funded by the Works Progress Administration.
Before the new reservoir began to fill, Jackson had located 54 sites on the west or Llano county side of
the Colorado River and another 19 sites on the east or Burnet County side. The east side was only
partially surveyed before rising water called a halt to the project, which accounts for the lower number.
All these sites were later given Smithsonian trinomial designations but little is known about the majority
of them other than their approximate location and a listing of the surface artifacts provided in the final
report (Jackson 1938) and on file at TARL. Clearly, a wide range of site types are represented; today we
might classify them as open campsites, quarries or lithic procurement sites, rockshelters, and burned rock
middens. A small number of these sites were selected by Jackson for excavation, with the burned rock
161

middens and rockshelters/caves near the base of Fall Creek Falls (Jackson 1938) receiving the most
attention.
The entire Cedar Point Recreation Area was surveyed by Prewitt and Associates in 1979 for an LCRA
brush clearing project (Prewitt and Kotter 1980). During this survey, two sites were recorded north of
FM 3014. Site 41LL354 is an Historic/prehistoric site located on a slight rise immediately north of the
highway and west of Cowan Creek. The Historic component contains the rough stone foundation piers of
a late 19-th century house surrounded by thinly scattered domestic debris, including bottle glass
fragments, whiteware sherds, at least one cut nail, and other miscellaneous metal fragments (Prewitt and
Kotter 1980). A few chert flakes were also found on the rise.
The other site recorded during the 1979 survey is 41LL353, located about half a mile east of 41LL354 on
high ground in the middle of a wide point of land extending into Lake Buchanan. Little is know about the
site and it has not been shovel tested by archeologists. The original survey reported two light scatters of
flakes exposed in a dirt road (Kotter 1980).
A survey in 2002 for a fence maintenance project in Cedar Point Park identified a prehistoric site,
41LL424, north of FM 3014 and approximately 1500 feet west of 41LL354 (Malof et al. 2004). Several
thin bifaces, a Darl point, a large fragment of a metate, and debitage were found scattered across about an
acre of land along a dry creek. The presence of the Darl point probably places this site in the latter part of
the Late Archaic II period, sometimes referred as the Transitional Archaic and dated to around AD 650.
Some rock that is possibly burned was also noted. There is little doubt that this site once extended into
what is now the FM 3014 ROW since artifacts were found right up to the ROW fence.
Shovel testing during the 2002 survey also found a high-density of lithics in the low-lying areas of
41LL354 closer to Cowan Creek (Malof et al. 2004). Prehistoric cultural material was also recovered
while shovel testing along the outer edge of south ROW of FM 3014 across from 41LL354, indicating
that this site extends south of the highway.
Shovel testing by LCRA archeologists for a water pipeline project in 2004 found buried prehistoric
artifacts in the south ROW of FM 3014 across from 41LL354, collaborating what was found in 2002.
The testing stayed within the highway ROW so the extent of 41LL354 to the south remained unknown.
In 2006, members of the Llano Uplift Archeological Society surveyed along the two right tributaries of
Cowan Creek south of the highway. Two prehistoric lithic scatters were recorded but trinomials were
never obtained.

Research Design and Methods
The purpose of the field investigation was to locate and record all cultural resources sites in the project
area and assess their eligibility for formal designation as SALs. The investigation consisted of a
pedestrian survey of areas with a high potential for archeological sites. Within the bounds of the current
project, these high and moderate probability areas are found along Cowan Creek and its three tributaries
that converge near RM 3014. These areas also happen to be the most brushy are where most of the
impacts caused by clearing will take place. Also the ridgetops between drainages were considered high
probability areas because of their elevation and the presence of surface rocks useful as cooking stones.
Shovel testing was an important part of the survey since in the author’s experience cultural material tends
to be engulfed by granite-derived soils leaving little trace on the surface of the presence of a site. The
main reason for this appears to be bioturbation caused by gophers (Figure 76).
For the pedestrian survey, a team of two or three archaeologists walked transects at 30 meter intervals
parallel to the creek channels. Ground surface visibility was found to be variable. During the survey
162

Figure 76. Gopher backdirt .mounds at 41LL842

numerous low mounded areas that appear to be push piles from previous brush clearing projects were
noted on the landscape (see Figure 75). These mostly likely date to the 1979-1980 era when LCRA is
known to have conducted a previous brush clearing program at Cedar Point.
Shovel tests were placed (1) randomly in areas along the lower courses of the stream to detect buried
cultural material, (2) within site areas to establish their boundaries, and (3) in the vicinity of surface
artifact finds. A total of 50 shovel tests were dug within the project area (Figure 77). All artifacts
recovered during testing except burned rocks were collected for eventual curation. For surface finds, only
diagnostic artifacts were collected.

Results of Investigations
Six new archeological sites - 41LL481 through 41LL486 - were recorded during the survey and the
boundaries of a seventh site, 41LL354, previously recorded north of RR3014 were extended to include an
area south of the highway (see Figure 77).
41LL481
The site is located between 100 and 200 meters south of where FM 3014 crosses Cowan Creek. Artifacts
probably continue to the south onto private property. The site was first recorded by the Llano Uplift
Archeological Society during a 2006 field trip but a trinomial was never sought for the site until the
current project.

163

Figure 77. Project area with shovel test locations and recorded site areas.

164

The site contains a light surface scatter of debitage and a few cores. A few examples of burned granite
are also present but could have resulted from recent brush burning. A mussel shell fragment was noted in
the roadcut bordering the property fence. The surface debitage is spread across the crest and upper
western slope of low ridge that extends northwards between a right tributary of Cowan Creek on the west
and much-smaller drainage to the east which probably enters Cowan Creek below the full pool level of
Lake Buchanan. The soils on the ridge have been mapped a belonging to the Click series. These soils
support a savanna grassland with scattered trees or motts. Overgrazing and mechanized land clearing
have encouraged invasive brush and cactus.
Seven shovel tests were placed within or immediately outside the site area. Five of these tests recovered
artifacts, mostly chert debitage and a few modern glass fragments in the upper 20 cm of soil and
occasionally a few flakes were as deep as 40 cm before clay was struck and the test ended. The
prehistoric tools recovered included one biface fragment and an edge modified flake. No burned rock or
features were encountered. As with most of the sites in the area, the artifacts were probably buried by
bioturbation or from artificial ground disturbances such as those caused by mechanical brush clearing.
Because of the absence of features, coupled with the disturbances to the thin archeological deposits, this
site does not appear to be eligible for SAL designation.
41LL482
This site is located between the two right tributaries of Cowan Creek with the center of the site lying
some 200 meters south southwest of where FM3014 crosses Cowan Creek. It was recorded along with
the site now designated as 41LL481 during the same 2006 LUAS field trip but was never given a
trinomial until the current project. The site extends from near the edge of one of the east tributaries
southwards for 150 meters, covering the high ground of the divide between the drainages. The vegetation
community is a oak-mesquite park with cedar thickets adjacent to the drainages. Old brush piles are
common as are gopher mounds.
A few pieces of debitage were visible on the surface in disturbed areas especially at the north end close to
the tributary channel. Six shovel tests placed within the site’s boundaries recovered between one to 11
pieces of debitage with the average being four. None of these flakes showed signs of edge modification.
A nearly complete mussel shell half was recovered from one test. All the artifacts came from the
gravelly, sandy loam surface soil zone (average thickness=30cm) above the red clay subsoil.
This site is similar to 41LL481 in that the artifacts mostly represent chipping debris and they are confined
to a surface soil zone that has been disturbed by mechanized land clearing. For these reasons, 41LL482
does appear to be SAL eligible.
41LL483
This prehistoric lithic scatter is located on the far west boundary of the project area about 500 meters
south of Ranch Road 3014. The site is situated near the crest of a hill about 30 to 50 meters north of a
tributary of Cowan Creek. That tributary creek has its confluence with Cowan Creek about 150 meters to
the southeast of the site. The site area is mostly wooded with tree types including live oak, blackjack oak,
and hackberry. Other vegetation includes prickly pear cactus, tasajillo, and various grasses.
Prehistoric artifacts at this site were discovered in the ruts of a dirt road that runs parallel with the inside
edge of the north-south running boundary fence of the project area. Ground surface visibility in the road
bed is excellent, and artifacts seen there consist of a Bulverde-like dart point, a biface fragment, and a
chert flake. These materials were found within an area that measures 20 meters on a north-south line by 5
meters on an east-west line.
165

Following the discovery of the artifacts in the road bed, additional survey of bare and eroded areas in the
woods east of the dirt road was then undertaken. No artifacts were found there, nor could any other
artifacts be seen on the recently cleared ground surface of the property immediately west of the fence.
Shovel Test #8 was then excavated in the woods just 5 meters east of the spot where the biface fragment
was found. This shovel test soil profile indicated that the brown gravelly sandy loam topsoil is just 13 cm
thick before the red gravelly clay B horizon is struck.
Given the sparseness of artifacts on ground surface and the fact that two of the three artifacts found are
finished tools, it would appear that the materials are representative of a hunting activity area that is
probably associated with a nearby campsite. It is probable that artifact density is low, and it is doubtful
that further investigation would yield any substantive data. The site is assessed as not meriting formal
designation as a State Archaeological Landmark.
41LL484
This site is located on the west side of a minor left tributary of Cowan Creek approximately 140 meters
south of FM3014. The southeast edge of the site comes within 50 meters of Cowan Creek and further
shovel testing might show that artifacts continue all the way to the creek channel. The results of the
present investigation seem to show that the site area extend along the banks of the tributary in a 50 meter
wide swath. The tributary appears to be no more than a gully formed by runoff from the slopes to the
west and is probably geologically recent. If that is the case, then this site is actually part of 41LL354
located on the opposite side of the tributary creek. Since the age of the tributary is uncertain, the area on
the west side of the tributary will be designated as a separate site, 41LL484.
The plant community in the upslope portion of the site is an oak-mesquite park while areas closer to the
Cowan Creek channel are covered by a cedar woods. Along the channels of both the creek and the
tributary grow fairly large blackjack oaks and hackberry trees. As elsewhere in the project area, large
brush piles of earth and charred wood are common.
No artifacts were visible on the surface and all cultural material was found through shovel testing. One
test (ST13) recovered a small projectile point, possibly a thick arrow pt in the upper 20cm along with
three pieces of debitage. A probable stone hearth was profiled in the northeast wall of this shovel test
resting at 34cm bs. One of the rocks in the hearth was a pecked granite metate fragment. The test was
ended at 40cm to avoid disturbing the feature further. Another test (SAT16) placed close to the tributary
(or gully) recovered a Pedernales point and four pieces of debitage in the upper 20cm of soil and three
pieces of debitage between 20 and 40cm. The test ended at 40cm because of waterlogged soil.
The site contains at least one buried hearth feature and probably more considering the limited subsurface
testing. The low number of artifacts suggests that component mixing is minimal even though the two
diagnostics are separated by perhaps two thousand years. This site is probably eligible for SAL
designation and will be protected from subsurface disturbances.
41LL485
This site is located at the mouth of the eastern most tributary of Cowan Creek immediately south of FM
3014. The low-lying areas close to the creek and along the highway are covered by brush and small trees,
mostly cedars. The site area extends westwards onto the tip of a low ridge where the vegetation is an
open oak-mesquite park A thin surface scatter of flakes was seen on the slope in the western part of site
in the ruts of an overgrown dirt road. A shovel test found only a chert chunk and mussel shell fragment in
the 30 cm of gravelly loam that overlies a grus substratum. Another shovel test placed on the nearly level
166

ground close to the tributary channel recovered 15 pieces of debitage between the surface and 50cm. A
test placed farther upstream in the same low-lying landform recovered a biface fragment between 20 and
40cm and a piece of debitage between 40 and 60cm. No additional shovel tests were dug because of
waterlogged soil conditions. The survey was unable to rule out the possibility of buried features and other
significant archeological deposits. It is felt that the site should be protected during this project and future
ground-disturbing projects until further investigations can be made.
41LL486
This site covers a very small area – less than 100 m2 - on the bank of the easternmost right tributary of
Cowan Creek 150 meters south of FM 3014. The ground is covered by thick grass except a small eroded
area on the bank where most of the artifacts were seen. Scattered blackjack oaks grow further inland to
the west. The artifacts found in or near the eroded surface included three cores and one flake. Finding a
suitable place for a shovel test was difficult because of the numerous brush piles. One test (ST30) placed
close to surface finds failed to recover artifacts. The clay subsoil was struck at 35 cm. Two more tests
placed further inland to the west also failed to recover artifacts. It appears that the cultural material at this
site is concentrated in one small spot or is too diffuse to detect through shovel testing. Because of the
small amount of cultural material, this site does not appear eligible for SAL designation.
41LL354
This site was previously recorded on the north side of FM3014 as a 19th homestead site with a prehistoric
component (Prewitt and Kotter 1980). Subsequent work in 2002 (Malof et al. 2004) and 2004 (Hixson et
al. 2006) by LCRA archeologists showed that prehistoric cultural material is buried in the south ROW of
the highway across from 41LL354. This material was considered to be part of 41LL354 which means
that this area of the site was off from the rest by highway construction. The 2002 and 2006 investigations
also showed that cultural material of 41LL354 extends eastwards to within 50 meters of Cowan Creek.
During the current survey it was presumed that the site continued southwards and that the cultural
material would, for the most part, be buried. Shovel testing began some distance from the road to
establish the southern limits of 41LL354. The southern boundary was found to be a small side tributary
of Cowan Creek that probably formed relatively recently. This is the same tributary discussed under site
41LL484. One shovel test (ST10) placed near this tributary found cultural material down to a depth of
between 80 to 100 cm. Two lenses of burned rock were encountered at 20cm and at 40cm separated by
soil with relatively few artifacts. The lower burned rock lens contained a granite metate fragment. There
was a significant increase in the amount of debitage recovered from the soil at approximately the same
elevations as these rocks. It is possible that this particular area was aggrading at times in the past,
perhaps from collluvial sediments washing downslope, resulting in two superimposed components.
Another test was placed close to the Cowan Creek Channel. Two pieces of debitage were recovered from
the surface down to 40cm but water-saturated soil made screening nearly impossible and further digging
in the test was ended.
With buried prehistoric components and possible burned rock features, this sites appears to be eligible for
SAL designation. The area will be cleared only in ways that will not result in below ground disturbances.
Summary and Recommendations
Six new archeological sites, 41LL481 through 41LL486, and a new area of 41LL354, were recorded
during the survey of the areas with high and moderate probabilities for archeological sites. Four sites,
which consist of 41LL481, 41LL482, 41LL483, and 41LL486, are assessed as not eligible for formal
167

designation as SALs. These four sites lack any evidences of subsurface features, and in some cases
artifacts are sparse and/or are present in previously disturbed areas.
Two of the sites, 41LL484 and the new area of 41LL354 are located adjacent to streams and contain
evidence of buried hearth features. Both of these sites are assessed as potentially eligible for SAL
designation. A third site, 41LL485 is also located on a stream and shovel testing found artifacts down to a
depth of at least 45cm. Waterlogged soil made further screening impossible but because of its location
along a stream, the site could potentially have intact buried components and is, therefore, assessed as
potentially eligible for SAL designation. Since these three sites are primarily buried sites, they will have
to be cleared in ways that avoid subsurface ground disturbances. This can be done using a Seppi Mulcher
attached to a skid steer or by hand cutting. Because the LCRA Conservation Services staff has previously
demonstrated that the use of a Seppi Mulcher does not cause subsurface damage, the use of the Seppi
Mulcher is proposed at these three sites.
As always, standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable to this project. Should the
construction personnel uncover any presently unknown buried archeological features during construction
work, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archeology Services
staff should be notified at 1-800-776-5272, ext. 6714 so that the find can be assessed in consultation with
the THC. In such a situation, work can continue in other areas where no archeological materials are
present.

Management Summary
The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA’s) Transmission Services Corporation plans to expand
their existing Gillespie Substation located on the western outskirts of Fredericksburg in Gillespie County
(Figure 78). The expanded facility will be constructed on 11 acres of an adjoining undeveloped property
northwest of the existing substation (Figure 79). Only one small portion of this area has ever been
surveyed for cultural resources. In 1982 the T-214 Transmission Line corridor, which runs through a
small portion of the current project area, was surveyed by the Texas Archeological Survey prior to the
line’s construction (Nightengale 1982). During this survey, no sites were identified in the section of T214 ROW that overlaps the current project area, however three isolated artifacts were noted on the
surface. As was standard practice at the time, no subsurface testing was done.
On June 15, 2009, LCRA’s Archeology Services staff conducted an intensive archeological survey of the
entire project area for the substation expansion. The survey found that nearly all the southeastern half of
the project area (here referred to as Area A) has experienced severe sheet erosion (Figure 80). A series of
berms runs northwest to southeast across Area A, which inclines moderately to the south, perhaps built at
the time of the original Gillespie Substation construction. On this truncated surface was found a moderate
scatter of lithics, including the proximal end of an Angostura point, and a very light scatter of late 19th
century trash along the east side of Area A close to Balcones Drive. No evidence of a house site was seen
in Area A. Shovel testing found no buried cultural deposits.
The northeastern half of the project area, here referred to as Area B, has a more level ground surface and a
patchy grass cover. This area shows signs of disturbances caused by recent brush clearing (Figure 81).
The one positive test out five placed in Area B recovered one flake in the plow zone above a depth of
20 cm. Unmodified chert cobbles occur in the northeast corner of Area B, originating from the Edwards
Limestone exposed at a higher elevation to the north and east. A few unmodified cobbles were also noted
in Area A.
The site represented by the lithic scatter in Areas A and B appears to be a northern extension of a
previously recorded site, 41GL279, which was originally recorded as a lithic scatter (Espey, Huston, and
Associates 1995) and later as a lithic scatter/procurement site along the south and east edges of the
original substation tract (Hixson et al. 2006). The present survey generally found the same types of
artifacts - debitage, early stage bifaces, unifaces, projectile point fragments - perhaps in somewhat higher
densities due to site deflation and excellent visibility. A hitherto unknown Historic component containing
late 19th century household trash is now recorded for this site as well. The new site area for 41GL279 is
shown in Figure 82.
Land contouring and subsequent erosion in the southwestern half of the project area and plowing and
brush clearing elsewhere has probably displaced nearly all the artifacts. The site offers little research
value because of the disturbances and the high probability that the material was temporally mixed to
begin with because of the area’s geology. For these reasons, the site is assessed as not being eligible for
SAL designation. It is recommended that the project proceed as planned.
No artifacts were collected for curation during the survey.

Environmental Background
Geology
Stairstep ridges typical of the Glen Rose Limestone rise to the north, south, and east above the project
area (Barnes 1981). To the west and southwest across the highway the ground slopes steadily down to the
broad floodplain of Barons Creek. Most of the project area itself rests on the Hensell Sand, a friable mix
of sand, silt, clay, and conglomerate except for the extreme northeastern portion which merges into the
Glen Rose Limestone. The Fort Tarrett member of the Edwards Limestone is exposed further upslope to
the north and east and is most likely the source of the chert cobbles seen in the project area.
Soils
Although now severely eroding, most of the project area was originally covered by deep clayey Krum
soils that have developed on the Hensell sand (Allison 1975). The A horizon of these soils is composed
of a dark grayish-brown silty clay two feet thick over a B2 horizon of lighter-colored grayish-brown silty
clay 17 inches thick with soft masses of calcium carbonate and a B3 of brown silty clay with soft masses
of calcium carbonate. The C horizon is grayish brown clay with many hard and soft calcium carbonate
masses.
The eastern one-third of the project area was originally covered by Luckenbach soils that developed on
calcareous clay loam and clay. These soils have very dark grayish brown to dark brown clay loam A
horizons 18 inches thick over reddish brown to brown clay B horizons that are 20 inches thick. The C
horizons are very pale brown clays. Both the B and C horizons contain calcium carbonate concretions.
At the extreme northeast corner of the project area are small areas of Brackett soils. These are composed
of grayish brown loams no more than 14 inches thick over the fracture limestone bedrock.
Physiography and Landforms
The project area is located at the extreme south end of the Great Plains province near the geographic
center of the Edwards Plateau. Before the substation was built, a series of natural drainages originated in
the area and carried runoff from the hills beyond to creek (Allison 1975). When the substation was built,
these drainages were apparently filled in and artificial ditches constructed which now divert rainwater
along the south side of the substation. The ground northwest of the substation where the expansion will
be built rises gently to north and northeast towards a series of prominent hills.
Vegetation
Considering that the soils in the project area are suitable for agriculture, it is probable that it was once
under cultivation. The southeastern half (Area A) is covered by a somewhat open cedar forest with
approximately 60% canopy cover. Almost no vegetation grows close to the ground in Area A because of
lack of top soil and ongoing erosion. The northwestern half (Area B) is still cleared of woody vegetation
and was probably used for pasture in recent times. Some clearing has taken place in the last year leaving
several large earth and brush piles (see Figure 81).

183

Cultural Background
Prehistoric Background
The project area lies in Central Texas Archeological Region, as defined by Prewitt (1981). The concept
of an “archeological region” developed at a time (1950s and 1960s) when most Texas archaeologists held
the normative view that a culture was defined by a series of shared traits. In the part of Texas where
hunter-gatherers were thought to have lived, the traits that concerned archaeologists the most were
projectile point forms followed by site types and cooking features. Later, in the 1960s and 1970s, many
processual archaeologists argued that culture operated as a system that allowed a population to adapt to its
environment. Since Central Texas is an environmentally diverse region, many different cultural systems
must have operated in the past. The population in the southern Plateau would have had a different
adaptation than one that included the Blackland Prairie in their interactive sphere. With little
ethnographic data on the indigenous population of the region, research in recent decades has focused on
cultural ecology and the materialist aspects of culture, including lithic technology (e.g. Goode in Malof et
al. 2007), cooking technology (Black et al. 1997), and subsistence (Derring in Collins et al. 1997), which
can, to some degree, be understood using the “hard” sciences.
Chronological frameworks for Central Texas have been proposed by researchers over the years, with the
one most commonly in use these days being that of Johnson and Goode (1992) with modifications by
Collins (1998). As with all such frameworks for the region, projectile point forms are used as time
markers within various time periods and subperiods.
Historic Background
The site of the settlement that would become known as Fredericksburg was chosen by John O.
Meusebach in 1845 as one of a proposed series of stops along the route to the Fisher-Miller Land Grant
north of the Llano River (Kohout 2005). Meuseback was a commissioner of the Adelsverein, a society
formed by German nobleman to establish colonies in Texas for German immigrants. German settlers
began arriving to the site the next year and soon after Meuseback named the settlement Fredericksburg
after Prince Frederick of Prussia, a member of the Adelsverein. Because of its distance from the coast,
the Fisher-Miller Land Grant was never settled by the Adelsverein and instead Fredericksburg became the
Adelsverein’s second colony after New Braunfels.
Fredericksburg grew rapidly to a population of 1000 in only two years. The establishment of Fort Martin
Scott in 1848 by the U.S. military provided a market for agricultural goods. Fredericksburg was also the
last town before El Paso for travelers along the Upper El Paso Road. During the Civil War, the town
remained loyal to the United States which prompted the Confederates to impose marshal law in1862.
Lawlessness was also problem during the Confederate period. Because of what they experienced during
the war, the people of Fredericksburg developed an isolationist philosophy towards the rest of the state
and held on the German traditions and language. The town became more open to outsiders later in the
19th century when the county fairs began to be held in town. The railroad reached the area belatedly in
1913 and was only in operation for less than 30 years, being unable to compete with the automobile
(Kohout 2005).

Previous Investigations
The first archeological excavation in Gillespie County was conducted by the University of Texas in 1936
at Lehman Rockshelter (now designated as 41GL1) near the town of Doss. Arthur Woolsey supervised
the excavations and the findings were later reported on by J. Charles Kelly (Kelly 1947). The cave
contained cultural deposits belonging to the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric. In addition to stone

184

artifacts, Woolsey and his crew recovered potsherds which appeared to have a highly polished red slip.
Kelly in his report gave these sherds the typological name “Doss Redware.” Lehman Rockshelter is also
a significant rock art site with a variety of figurative and abstract pictographs in red, black, and white
paint. The artist Leland Kirkland made watercolor paintings of many of the pictographs which were later
published by University of Texas Press (Kirkland and Newcomb 1999).
In the early 1970s during a routine archeological survey conducted ahead of a proposed widening of State
Highway 16, a prehistoric site was located along a small nameless stream one mile north of
Fredericksburg (Denton 1976). The investigators christened it the No-Name Creek Site and excavated
five and a half five-foot square units within the highway ROW. The excavations uncovered shallowly
buried camping debris and one small, disturbed burned rock feature all primarily belonging to the period
when Pedernales and Marshall points were in use. The report attempted to show an evolutionary link in
the manufacturing technology between the Pedernales type and the later Marshall type.
Numerous cultural resource surveys have been carried out in the county in recent years. In 1982, the
Texas Archeological Survey conducted a survey of the LCRA’s T-214 Transmission Line that runs
northwards from the Gillespie Substation to the Mason County line, a total distance of 14 miles
(Nightengale 1982). The T-214 corridor crosses the current project area for a distance of 200 meters
immediately north of the substation No sites were identified along that stretch, however two late-stage
bifaces and a secondary flake were noted in the area.
Espey, Huston, and Associates (EH&A) surveyed the corridor of a proposed transmission line running
from the Gillespie Substation to the then-proposed Nimitz Substation (EH&A 1994). During the survey,
three sites were located, all representing prehistoric lithic scatters confined for the most part to the
surface. One of these sites, 41GL279, appears to extend into the southeast edge of the current project
area. The site is reported to contain mostly small interior flakes with a smaller percentage of larger
cortical flakes. One flake appeared to show unspecified used wear. The absence of soil in the area
precluded buried deposits.
In 2005, an intensive archeological survey was conducted by the LCRA’s Archeology Services of areas
adjacent to the east and south sides of the Gillespie Substation that were planned for contouring to
alleviate silting (Hixson et al. 2006). The survey found a moderate lithic scatter covering most of the
project area which had been disturbed by previous contouring of the substation grounds. This cultural
material was considered part of the previously recorded site 41GL279, located immediately south of the
substation. The new boundaries of this site were therefore extended northwards to the southern edge of
the current project area.
During a 2007 maintenance project on the transmission line (T-207) that runs in a southwesterly direction
from the Gillespie Substation, LCRA’s Archeology Services recorded a multi-component site on both
sides of Barons Creek 500 meters from the current project area (Malof and Prikryl 2008). Burned
limestone rocks and lithics were seen on the surface on both sides of the creek, the densest material being
on the south side, and burned rocks were also seen eroding out of the creekbank at a depth of one meter.
The site has minor Historic components as well, an early 20th century trash dump on the north side and a
cement trough or tank on the south side.
Research Design and Methods
The purpose of the field investigation was to locate and record all cultural resources sites in the project
area and to assess their eligibility or for formal designation as SALs. Because of its small size, the entire
project area was surveyed intensively a two man crew walking transects approximately 30 feet apart.
The Soil Survey map shows that the soils in the area developed on Lower Cretaceous Hensell Sand.

185

Because these soils developed on ancient parent material that predates humans in North America and
because the soils’ clayey composition would impede downward movement of artifacts, we expect cultural
material to be confined to the surface or near surface within the A Horizon (topsoil) if this soil zone has
not eroded away. Shovel tests were to be placed in areas where ground visibility was poor. However
since visibility was generally good to excellent and the topsoil of Area A absent due to blading and
erosion, the tests were mostly placed in the northeastern half (Area B) of the project area where at least
some topsoil appeared to be present. A total of eight shovel tests were dug; their locations are shown in
Figure 2. Lack of top soil and good visibility made additional shovel tests unnecessary. Artifacts
recovered during shovel testing were returned to the hole with the fill. No artifacts were collected for
curation during the survey.
Results of Investigations
The survey found a moderate surface scatter of debitage and stone tools spread out over the entire project
area in no apparent concentration. The extent and density of artifacts suggest low intensity use of the site
over a long period of time.
Topsoil was absent in Area A, having been removed by previous blading to create a series of berms and
by the subsequent sheet erosion. Wall profiles of the three shovel tests placed in Area A show an absence
of the dark brown A horizons of the Krum and Luckenbach soils. No artifacts were recovered from these
shovel tests. Low growing vegetation was nearly absent resulting in an almost 100% ground visibility.
The artifacts seen on the surface in Area A included debitage, side scrapers, cores, early stage bifaces, and
the proximal end of an Angostura point. Both sides of most of these artifacts were extensively covered by
a white patina. A small amount of late 19th century household trash was seen along the east edge of
Area A mixed with recent trash thrown from Balcones Drive. The trash scatter consisted of one amethyst
glass fragment, one cut nail, and five shards from a whiteware dish. No evidence of a house site such as
stone piers or bricks was seen anywhere in the project area.
The Area B surface was found to be nearly level except in the far northeast corner where the ground starts
to rise towards prominent hills outside the project area. Area B had recently been cleared of brush and
several large trees at the time of the survey. A light scatter of highly patinated chert debitage and one
early-stage biface fragment were noted on the surface. Four shovel tests placed in Area B had no artifact
recovery; a fifth test (ST 3) placed near the northern property fence recovered a single flake in the upper
20 cm of soil. No A horizon typical of Krum and Luckenbach soils was seen in the wall profiles of these
tests and the upper 20 cm appeared disturbed, perhaps belonging to an old plow zone.
Recommendations
The cultural material found in Areas A and B probably represents a northern extension of the previously
recorded 41GL279. The known areas of the site, including the portion surveyed for this report, contain a
lithic scatter of moderate density without features or clearly-identified burned rock. The portion of
41GL279 within the current project area is situated on a non-aggrading eroded landform composed of the
Lower Cretaceous Hensell Sand. The cultural material there was probably already temporally mixed
before the area was bladed and eroded. Because of the extensive disturbances and mixing of cultural
material, this portion of 41GL279 has little potential for research and is not eligible for SAL designation.
Therefore it is recommended that the substation extension project be allowed to proceed.
As always, standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable to this project. Should the
construction personnel uncover any presently unknown buried archeological features during construction
work, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archeology Services
staff should be notified.

Introduction and Management Summary
LCRA Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) proposes to rebuild an existing transmission line (T-443
between the North McCamey, AEP McCamey, and future McCamey B (will be renamed Tippet)
substations in Upton, Crockett and Pecos counties, Texas (Figure 83). This 12.7 mi stretch of line (137
acres) will be improved to increase transmission of wind generated power to other portions of the state.
Existing structures will be left in place, although three new structures will be added at both the North
McCamey and AEP McCamey substations (Figure 84). The McCamey B (Tippet) substation will be built
on 10 acres of land just south of the Pecos River in Pecos County (Figure 85).
This line was surveyed for an earlier rebuild in 2002 by LCRA Archaeology Services staff (Malof et. al
2004: 116-138). Five archaeological sites, all prehistoric, were recorded. Sites 41UT41, 41CX909 and
910 were considered fully documented and ineligible for formal State Archeological Landmark (SAL)
listing. Sites 41CX908 and 41PC557 were located on either side of the Pecos River. At 41CX908 it was
felt there was the potential for discrete buried components within a lower terrace, and avoidance was
recommended at that location. Site 41PC557 was considered highly disturbed within the ROW, but felt
to have potential additional research potential in areas outside the ROW. The line through the substation
location, which is located approximately 300 m southeast of the site’s center, was not intensively
surveyed, as it was outside high probability areas as defined and agreed upon by LCRA and the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) at the time.
Due to the relatively large size of the substation location on a terrace not too distant from the Pecos River,
it was decided by LCRA Archaeology Services that a cultural resources survey was warranted. The focus
was on the substation tract, although the locations of the six new transmission line structures were also
assessed.
As a result of these investigations, one new prehistoric archaeological site, Site 41PC670 was recorded.
Site 41PC670 is a scatter of burned rock and sparse chert lithic material covering the northern one-third of
the project area. The site has been heavily disturbed by past ranching and apparently farming enterprises.
Twenty shovel tests failed to find any evidence of buried cultural material, and the surficial expression
has almost no integrity.
It is therefore recommended the project be allowed to proceed, with the understanding that
recommendations for avoidance at 41CX908 be maintained. All other transmission line work and
substation construction may proceed as proposed with no archaeological avoidance or monitoring
necessary.
During the course of the investigations a no-collection policy was maintained. No artifacts were collected
so no curation will be necessary.
The following report borrows heavily from the 2002 survey results (Malof et. al 2004) especially in the
background sections. A quick review of the Historic Texas Sites Atlas indicates there have been
additional sites recorded in both Pecos and Crockett counties, although none in the immediate vicinity of
the transmission line. The underlying chronology and culture history has not been substantially updated.

Natural Setting
The project area is located in parts of four counties, Crane, Upton, Crockett, and Pecos. The Tectonic
Map of Texas (BEG, http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/texas92a.jpg) places the area within the Paleozoic
Ellenburger tectonic episode. This region was covered by vast seas during Permian times that withdrew
from northeast to southwest, leaving salt-forming conditions within a broad basin overlying marine fossilbearing strata up to 7000 ft thick (Sellards et al.:1978:185-186). Much of this subsidence-induced
Permian Basin actually underlies portions of the Edwards Plateau and Llano Estacado (Vertrees: 2001). .
Physiographic maps available through LCRA GIS Services and derived from Texas Natural Resource
Information System (TNRIS) maps place the area largely within the Trans-Pecos desert scrub zone, but
also very near and partially within the Edwards Plateau live-oak and mesquite savanna to the east and the
Trans-Pecos Stockton Plateau to the south. It is also described as being within the Great Plains province
(Fenneman and Douglas 1946 in Carr 1967:3). Annual precipitation is between 12 and 16 inches per year
(Carr 1967:4), mean annual temperature is between 68 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit (Carr 1967:19), and
growing season of between 215 and 245 days per year (Orton 1969:891).
The project area also falls very near the division of Blair’s (1950) Balconian and Chihauhaun provinces,
which closely parallels Carr’s (1967:6) Edwards Plateau and Trans-Pecos climatic blocks. General soil
types likewise break very near the project area, with mixed Edwards Plateau mollisols and aridisols
giving way to predominant Trans-Pecos aridisols (Godfrey et al. n.d.). Vegetation-based ecological areas
are also described as Edwards Plateau and Trans-Pecos to the immediate east and west of the project area.
Specifically, the project is within or traverses Creosotebush-Mesquite Shrub and Creosotebush-Tarbush
Shrub types (McMahan et al. 1984). Shrubland is described as “individual woody plants…less than 9 feet
tall scattered throughout arid or semi-arid regions [with] less than 30 percent woody canopy coverage”
(McMahan et al. 2). Commonly associated plants include cholla, sotol, mesquite, acacia, catclaw,
lechugilla, pricklypear, desert sumac, and various grasses (McMahan et al. 1984:6,7). Blair suggests 83
types of mammals are found within his Chihauhaun Province, while 57 are associated with the Balconian
Province (Blair 1950: 107,113).
This area, drained by the Pecos River, therefore has a wealth of potential resources. The primary limiting
factor in human settlement would be access to water, but otherwise a rich and diverse environment would
have supported prehistoric populations.

Culture History
Just as the natural region is at a transition zone, apparently so is the cultural region. There is no formal
culture history for the Permian Basin, and archaeological reports reach to adjacent proscribed
archaeological regions for comparative purposes. These regions include the Lower Pecos, the TransPecos, and to a lesser extent Central Texas. Understanding of the Trans-Pecos region, in turn, was
influenced by work in the Lower Pecos at Lake Amistad (Marmaduke 1978:95-96), while work in Central
Texas provided anchors for Lower Pecos investigations, which then reinforced the work done in Central
Texas (Johnson 1995:80). The Trans-Pecos, however, seemed to exhibit relatively little change in site
types over time, providing evidence for established foraging-based subsistence exploiting seasonally
abundant resources and represented by sites consisting of fire-cracked rock, ash middens, and hearths
(Marmaduke 1978:147-148). While not necessarily tautological, these interpretations are of necessity
from a self-reinforcing mechanism.
The project area thus lies within a poorly known region (Fox 1997:2) located between a long-stable
Trans-Pecos adaptation and a potentially more dynamic Lower Pecos region (Turpin 1995:543) and

195

Central Texas (Collins 1995) where a defined and relatively well-pronounced sequence of cultural change
is established. Various sources can be referenced, but a basic sequence of changes in projectile point
styles was proposed by Story and Bryant (1966) and utilized by several investigators in the general area
(e.g. Young 1981, Luke 1983) that splits prehistory in eight periods. More recently, a standardized and
perhaps more useful (sensu Johnson 1987) scheme was used by Turpin (2001) that follows the
Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic periods.
More recently, Crane, Crockett, Pecos, and Upton counties attracted non-Native settlers, probably due to
extensive grasslands (Vertrees 2001). The development of Crane County seems to be typical for the area
Leffler 2001). Wells were dug to provide water, irrigation and farming were successful for a short time,
but as native grasses became over-grazed and marginal soils were exhausted the economy soured until
discovery of oil in the 1920s. These highly productive oil fields became either a mainstay or important
supplement to local inhabitants. Recently oil production has dropped, and tourism, centered largely
around hunting, has become increasingly important, as has the production of wind energy.

Previous Investigations
Intensity of previous archaeological work in the region varies considerably by county. According to the
Texas Historic Sites Atlas, Upton County has 50 previously recorded sites, while Pecos County has 669
and Crockett County has 1022. Although this to some extent may be due to the difference in size of these
counties, and associated variability in physiographic settings, it is also undoubtedly an artifact of
differential levels of investigation.
According to Gibson (1980), early work was conducted by V. J. Smith in Alpine area rockshelters during
the 1920s, and by 1935 E. B. Sayles had constructed a basic chronology. In 1940, J. Charles Kelley
described a Pecos River and Livermore focus with an emphasis on the wealth of material culture that was
recovered from dry caves (Gibson 1980:7).
The impoundment of the Rio Grande River that created Amistad Reservoir resulted in a number of
investigations during the 1950s and 60s, the most important of which are described by Story and Bryant
(1966). These stratified terrace and shelter sites, such as Bonfire Shelter, Fate Bell Shelter, and the
Devil’s Mouth Site allowed chronologies and environmental reconstructions that were relevant to both the
Lower Pecos and Central Texas regions to be developed and revised.
Salvage work continued in the 1970s as Interstate Highway 10 was designed and developed (Crawford
1973). Other highway projects during the same period resulted in publication of the results of several
investigations including the Squawteat Peak Site (Young 1981), sites in Muskhog Canyon (Luke 1983),
and the Ram’s Head Site (Young 1982), among others. The focus of many of these were the burned rock
middens and hearth sites found within the various rights-of-way. These investigations helped define use
and temporal distribution of these features and site types.
More recently the All-American Pipeline Project created opportunities for survey level investigations
(Carlson and Mueller-Whille 1994, Labadie 1987) and archival research leading to a predictive model
(Bamforth 1984). Bamforth, using a fairly limited data set, identified high probability areas as those
where known sites existed, where alignments crossed major drainages, and areas of dune fields.
Moderate probability areas included ridges and hills associated with water and plant resources and
alluvial fans. Low probability areas were “open, unwatered plains east of the Pecos”, with the
understanding that small, unmapped playa lakes were potentially present, and that sites would not be
absent, only less frequent in occurrence (Bamforth 1984:41-42).

196

The recent development of wind farms, erection of power generating wind turbines primarily on high
mesas, has produced the most recent work (e.g. Turpin 2001, Karbula et al. 2001) other than various
small-scale projects (e.g. Fox 1997) and work by local avocational and archaeological societies. The
wind farm work has resulted in intensive investigations of apparently previously unexplored mesa tops
where fairly dense clusters of sites belie a seeming lack of permanent water sources. There does seem to
be an association of these sites with minor depressions and tinajas that would allow for short-term water
storage. The consistency of site types, middens, hearths, and lithic procurement sites, suggest that
consistent activities, probably based primarily on subsistence acquisition, were carried out on a seasonal
basis (Turpin 2001:21).
A number of sites have been recorded within the general vicinitypof the project area. Northwest of Crane
are sites 41CR1, 12 and 11. Site 41CR1 was located near a spring and included Alibates chert, El Paso
area ceramics, dart points, and an associated burial. Sites 41CR11 and 12 were both associated with
deflated dunes, one described as a camp and one a limited activity area. A cluster of sites are plotted
southeast of Crane on the midslopes of King Mountain. Unfortunately, sites 41UT30-37 had no
information available on them. Nearby sites 41UT17 and 18, however, were both burned rock scatters
with disturbed hearths. Both were within 200 m of erosional gullies. Southwest of these sites, on the
lower plain, are sites 41CR15 and 16. Site 41CR15 was a historic scatter with no solid temporal
affiliation. Site 41CR16 was a single hearth with associated chert debitage. Further south, 41UT1,
located on the upper edge of King Mountain, was recorded as a rockshelter with petroglyphs and midden
deposits. Site UT27, located on the lower plain northwest of McCamey, was a single scatter of burned
rock with no associated artifacts. No additional sites are recorded until reaching Southwest Mesa.
Upland sites 41CX881 and 882 had no information available beyond site locations. Sites 41CX787 and
788 were located on the lower slopes or plain below the mesa. Site 41CX787 contained two burned rock
middens and several heaths along with mortar holes adjacent to natural catch basins. Located on the
mesa’s “first terrace”, it appears to conform to Bamforth’s prediction of sites along ridges near water
sources. Site 41CX788 was described as an open camp consisting of a two middens and several hearths.
Both dart and arrow points were recovered. To the west of the ROW, adjacent or near the Pecos River,
were several more sites. Site 41CX19 has minimal information available, but contained ceramics and
lithics. Site 41CX18 likewise contained ceramics, stone tools and mortar holes. Site CX776 had two
“sotol pits” and several hearths, along with assorted chert cores and scrapers. Charcoal and chert deposits
were reported to 2 ft in depth. The south bank of the Pecos River contains 41PC58, an open camp being
excavated by the Iraan Archaeological Society. No additional information was available. Site 41PC91
appears to be a canal associated with the Spanish Dam, site 41PC90. No more information was available,
and local informants were not able to say much other than it was a dam made of stone blocks. There is no
entry for “Spanish Dam” in the Handbook of Texas Online. One of the sites nearest the line is southwest
of the Tippet substation. Site 41PC555 is a historic farmstead, apparently dating to the mid-twentieth
century. Nearby is site 41PC554, a diffuse lithic scatter with chert debris. The remaining nearby sites are
atop Indian Mesa. Site 41PC491 was a light lithic scatter, 41PC544 was a lithic quarry or reduction area,
41PC545 was a lithic scatter with a possible hearth near a small drainage, and 41PC548 contained two
burned rock middens, each within 5 m of ephemeral drainages.
These sites indicate a fairly wide range of topographic settings were being utilized prehistorically.
Bamforth’s predictive model is partially substantiated, but the wealth of mesa-top sites indicates these
areas are also of high probability for substantial archaeological sites. By extension, ephemeral water
sources appear to have been of high importance, especially as they relate to seasonal subsistence and
settlement patterns. Fairly large sites were found along mesa slopes, ridges, and toes, and occasional
hearths and burned rock scatters were seemingly randomly distributed across lower plains. Most sites
dated from Middle (now Late) Archaic (ca. 3500 B. P.) to Late Prehistoric times. Ceramics were
primarily associated with far West Texas or New Mexico/Northern Mexico, although some bone
tempered pottery was also recorded. Projectile points typical for the area included Langtry, Marcos, Darl,

197

Figueroa, Val Verde, and Perdiz, among others. There seems to be a mixing of those expected from
Central Texas and those from the Lower Pecos region.
region. Burials are not uncommon, possibly due to the
climate. Common features are burned rock middens, hearths, and burned rock scatters. Shelters often
had petroglyphs or other art, with reverse hand prints apparently common. These shelters are often just
below the upper mesa tops, seeming to develop within the resistant caprock formations.

Research Design and Field Methods
The primary focus of the investigation was the 10-acre
10 acre substation site. The substation itself will be
between 3 and 5 acres, but it as the potential to be placed anywhere within the larger tract. Elsewhere, at
the two McCamey area substations, the six new structure locations received reconnaissance level survey,
as the locations had technically been previously surveyed and they were
were both in low probability areas.
The remainder of the transmission line was not resurveyed. At the substation location standardized 30 m
transects were established and maintained as best as possible through the dense mesquite. The project
area coordinates
es had been uploaded into a GPS unit which was the primary means of maintaining ground
orientation. The suggested minimum survey standards were followed on this project, with a total of 20
shovel tests excavated in the 10 acre tract. No artifacts were co
collected.

Results of Investigation
North McCamey Substation
There will be three new structures at the North McCamey substation. Two will be placed on the corners
of the existing pad, and the third about 120 m to the southeast. This area received pedestrian survey, but
no shovel tests were excavated, as it was considered to be an area of
of very low probability for buried
cultural materials (Figure 86).
). No cultural resources were noted.

At AEP McCamey the situation was very similar, with two new structures at the existing pad and a third
located 70 m to the southeast. Identical procedures were conducted at this location, and no cultural
resources were identified (Figure 87, Figure 88).

McCamey B (Tippet) Substation
This ten-acre tract was surveyed by three archaeologists walking approximately 30 m apart. Shovel tests
were placed both randomly along transects and judgmentally within areas with visible cultural material.
One new archaeological site, 41PC670, was recorded.
Site 41PC670 is a diffuse scatter of burned limestone, occasional flakes, and a few tools. One likely (very
disturbed) hearth has seen. The site is located within dense mesquite that has grown rapidly in the past
few years. Ground visibility tended to be excellent, however. A series of agricultural berms run parallel
through the tract, and are spaced about 20 m apart. These remnant terraces are readily visible on aerial
imagery (Figure 89), and the prior disturbance almost certainly accounts for the mesquite growth, which
is much more dense here than in the surrounding desert. Soils were often deflated to the brownish-red
(reddish-yellow) subsoil consistent with the mapped Monahans-Parajito and Reagan-Hodgins associated
soils. Pale gray and pinkish silts and silt loams are is some cases still present to depths of 50 cm in some
places.
A total of 20 shovel tests were excavated, 15 within the site boundary. Only one, ST 5, located near a
disrupted hearth, was positive for cultural material, which consisted of two large burned rocks and some
small burned rock fragments (Figure 90).

Figure 90. Shovel Test 5 near disrupted hearth.

In total, perhaps 100 burned rocks were seen across the entirety of the site, often grouped in sets of 3-4,
but sometimes 10-20 within a 20 m or so radius. Only the apparent hearth had any semblance of
structure, consisting about nine 10-15 cm rocks in a 3 m diameter area. No charcoal or other organic
material was seen. Only about 10 pieces of debitage were seen across the site, primarily interior flakes,
some of a distinctive, pink banded chert. One probable graver/perforator was noted, and also two
possible edge-modified flakes. A single projectile point was seen within the transmission line ROW, and
had been recently broken. This long, thin point was made unifacially on a flake. It may have been a large
arrow point or a thin dart point – the stem was missing (see Figure 91).
Along the western edge of the site was an historic trash scatter consisting of various glass (mostly clear),
whiteware, porcelain, milk glass and metal. This ephemeral 20th century trash dump was noted but not
extensively recorded.
Site 41PC670 (Figure 91) is most probably a disturbed outlier of previously recorded site 41PC557,
which had large quantities of fire-cracked rock, lesser amounts of debitage, two Langtry (one possibly a
Val Verde) points, and a portion of an arrow point. This site was recorded as terminating about 200 m
south of the Pecos River. Site 41PC670, meanwhile, had a slight but noticeable increase in cultural
material from south to north, with a total extent of cultural material to a distance of about 400 m from the
river. There is nothing mapped topographically to suggest physical constraints on 41PC557, and it almost
certainly extends both directions along the river for some unknown distance. For management purposes,
and because of a lack of survey access outside the two separate project areas, Site 41PC670 is described
uniquely. As such, it is considered to be fully documented with neither component felt to be eligible for
formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA proposed to rebuild transmission line T-443 between the existing North McCamey and future
McCamey B (Tippet) substations in Upton, Crockett and Pecos counties, Texas. The project will require
placing three new structures at the North McCamey and AEP McCamey substations, both located in
McCamey, in Upton County. A new substation will be built within a 10-acre tract just south of the Pecos
River, in Pecos County. The remainder of the project will be limited to adding additional conductor and
supports to existing transmission line structures. The existing ROW will require standard clearing,
mostly the shredding of mesquite and low shrubs.
This line was surveyed in for an earlier rebuild in 2002 by LCRA Archaeology Services staff. Five
archaeological sites, all prehistoric, were recorded. Sites 41UT41, 41CX909 and 910 were considered
fully documented and ineligible for formal State Archeological Landmark (SAL) listing. Sites 41CX 908
and 41PC557 were located on either side of the Pecos River. At 41CX908 it was felt there was the
potential for discrete buried components within a lower terrace, and avoidance was recommended at that
location. Site 41PC557 was considered highly disturbed within the ROW, but felt to have potential
additional research potential in areas outside the ROW. The substation location, which is located
approximately 300 m southeast of the site’s center, was not intensively surveyed at this time, as it was
outside high probability areas as defined and agreed upon by LCRA and the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) at the time.
One new archaeological site, 41PC670, was recorded during the present survey at the substation tract.
This site is probably an outlier of 41PC557, but access issues across private property precluded
conclusively tying the two together. Site 41PC670 is a diffuse scatter of burned rock with a very few
flakes and a minimum number of tools across the northern portion (about 4.4 acres). The entire
substation tract has been previously disturbed by agricultural activities. There was little evidence of
oilfield disturbance, however.
It is recommended that project be allowed to proceed as proposed, with no additional archaeological
investigations necessary, with the understanding that the area previously recommended for avoidance at
41CX908 be maintained (Figure 92). This is the area south of structure 131, and extends for a distance of
75 m (250 ft) towards the Pecos River. Any clearing in this area should be done by hand.

Introduction and Management Summary
LCRA Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) proposes to construct a new substation in the town of
Fredericksburg in central Gillespie County, Texas, which will be called the Hollmig Substation (Figure
93). The substation will abut existing transmission line T-120 and will be placed within an approximate
8-acre tract now owned by the City of Fredericksburg. The property is presently used as a storage area
for fill from various city projects and is partially covered by large backdirt piles. Aerial imagery from the
past few years shows movement of piles as well as removal of an asphalt road on the property. Despite
this, a review of previously recorded archaeological sites in the area indicated a moderate probability for
the presence of prehistoric materials, and the project area’s location near Fredericksburg suggested
historic sites might be present as well. A cultural resources investigation was conducted on October 28,
2009, by members of LCRA Archaeology Services staff. The investigation was intended to comply with
the Antiquities Code of Texas and the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Texas
Historical Commission and LCRA, and followed rules and procedures set forth in Chapter 26 of the
Texas Administrative Code as well as survey guidelines adopted by the Texas Historic Commission.
No cultural resources sites were recorded as a result of the investigation. A total of 12 shovel tests were
excavated, which is somewhat less than the recommended minimum for a project of this size, but is
considered sufficient given the nature of previous disturbances and the amount of visibility.
No artifacts were collected and no curation will be necessary.

Environmental Background
The project is located about 1.7 miles south-southwest of the center of Fredericksburg on Hollmig Lane
between Highways 87 and 16. The nearest perennial water source is Baron’s Creek, about 1.2 miles to
the northeast. Live Oak Creek is about two miles to the west, and the Pedernales River is about 2 miles to
the south. Geologic formations are mapped as Cretaceous Hensell Sands with isolated pockets of
potential Holocene-aged colluvial deposits (Qc formation) is some areas (Barnes 1981). NRCS data
indicates soils are Heaton loamy fine sand and Lone Oak fine sand, both described as deep and well
drained. Vegetation is mapped as Live Oak Mesquite Parks (McMahon et. al 1984). Observed conditions
were an open field of Bermuda grass and an isolated mesquite tree. Soils were primarily reddish sands
except to the north where a pocket of grayish sands predominated.

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations
The project area is within the Central Texas Archaeological Region as variously defined (see Ellis et. al
1995). The cultural chronology generally used with the rest of the region describes four main periods
spanning some 12,000 years of known human occupation (Collins 1995).
Fredericksburg was settled primarily by German immigrants beginning in the 1840s. Fredericksburg was
soon a thriving community that tried hard to hold on to its German heritage (Kohout 2006). Originally
known as Fort Houston, Fort Martin Scott was established near Fredericksburg in 1848. As the frontier
moved westward the fort became irrelevant and was decommissioned in 1853 (Brooks 2006).
Although a number of sites have been recorded in Gillespie County there were two (41GL44 and
41GL45) that were relevant to the current project, both recorded in 1975 by Malcom Johnson. Site
41GL44 was located about 1.2 miles south of the project area and was described as an open camp of
possible Late Archaic age. Johnson noted a stone ring he felt might be the foundation of prehistoric hut.

The second site, 41GL45 was about 0.6 miles south of the project area. Also described as an open camp,
it contained burned rock as well as what he referred to as “pointed choppers,” a tool type he felt was
emergent for the region. (Based on the description, these may be similar to what have been termed
“bitted choppers” by the author, which have been found as isolated objects, often in upland settings
around the Highland Lakes, and are interpreted as extraction implements.) Both these site were at some
distance from any obvious water sources. Johnson felt 41GL45 may have been on the edge of an ancient
lake or swamp. Regardless, the presence of these two sites in the same general setting as the project area
essentially triggered the investigation.

Research Design and Methods
The cultural resource investigation was designed simply to determine if archaeological sites were present,
and if so, to evaluate their potential for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
Following file searches to determine soil types and other aspects of land form as well as the nature and
location of previously recorded sites in the area, the project area was visited by a team of three
archaeologists who conducted an intensive walkover, followed by judgmentally placed shovel tests.
Twelve shovel tests were excavated. This is four fewer than survey standards suggest for a project this
size, but if the two acres that are clearly disturbed are subtracted from the eight acre total, the number of
shovel tests could be argued as meeting standards. Regardless, the number of tests are considered
adequate give the nature and extent of previous disturbance and the high level of visibility, primarily in
the backdirt of ground-dwelling animals.

Results of Investigations
No archaeological sites were recorded. The twelve excavated shovel tests (Figure 94) were fairly
consistent in profile with about 30-40 cm of reddish brown sandy loam over red clay. Only two shovel
tests failed to hit clay and were excavated to a depth of 100 cm. One edge modified flake was seen in
animal backdirt at the far southeast corner of the project area. Three shovel tests (1, 4, and 12) were
placed in the vicinity of this find. None found artifacts. A single hard hammer flake was seen near a
disturbed area at about the project area center. Shovel Test 5, placed nearby, and adjacent ST 6 found no
artifacts. Shovel Test 2 was placed near two small flakes seen near a highly disturbed area. It was
negative. Judgmentally placed ST 8 found two chips in the upper 20 cm (probably from the surface).
Nearby ST 9 was negative.
Although at least one flake appeared to be relatively in situ (on an animal backdirt pile) others were
clearly out of context. Some artifacts were seen on top of large piles of dirt that contained broken sewer
pipes and chunks of street paving material. This area appears to be a storage area for various public
works projects, especially sewer line line upgrades or repairs, and aerial imagery shows the project area
changing in a relatively short period of time. A large retention pond was built just to the south, and some
of the fill material may have come from that location. Some, if not all, of the observed artifacts may have
originated elsewhere.
It is recommended that construction of the Hollmig Substation be allowed to proceed, with the
understanding that standard emergency discovery procedures will be in place.

Introduction and Management Summary
LCRA Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) proposes to improve the capacity of an existing
transmission line that runs from the Pitsburg substation, in Llano, westward through the Castell
substation, located on the Llano/Mason County line, then to the CTEC/Mason substation, ending at the
Fort Mason substation, south of Mason (Figure 95). The total length of the project is approximately 33.9
miles. The section from Pitsburg to Castell is 17.25 mi in length, and will utilize an existing 100-ft wide
ROW, for a total of 209 acres. From Castell to Fort Mason, the existing 16.65-mi line previously owned
by Central Texas Electric Coop (CTEC) and then American Electric Power (AEP), is within a 50-ft wide
ROW, for a total of 101 acres for that section. Total project acreage, then, is 310 acres.
This line will be completely rebuilt, with new structures, primarily single-pole, placed in locations that
may or may not be near existing wooden H-frame structures. Typical distance between structures is
usually 900-1200 ft. However, in order to maintain the required 50 ft easement from Castell to Fort
Mason, structures will need to be much closer together.
An additional component of the project includes adding approximately two acres to the Central Texas
Electric Coop (CTEC) Fort Mason substation, which is located on the north side of Hwy 29 about 2.5
miles east of Mason. LCRA TSC will own the additional 2 acres that will be on the east side of the
existing substation tract. The remainder will continue to be owned by CTEC.
Because the entirety of the line does not appear to ever have been surveyed for cultural resources it was
determined that a cultural resources assessment was warranted. The assessment consisted of a map and
file review, which developed a predictive model and allowed high probability areas (HPAs) to be defined.
High probability areas received intensive cultural resources survey including pedestrian survey with
shovel testing. Some lower probability areas were subject to reconnaissance level investigations, while
other areas were not surveyed. There was 7.9 miles of HPA in Mason County, totaling 48 acres (50 ft
ROW) and 6.5 miles of HPS in Llano County totaling 78 acres (100 ft ROW), for a total approximate
survey area of 126 acres.
Eighteen previously unrecorded archaeological sites were recorded (see Table 11, Figure 96, Figure 97,
Figure 98). Fifteen of these were lithic scatters indicative of short term hunting camps along intermittent
streams. All except 41LL490 are considered to be fully recorded within and adjacent to the ROW and no
further work is recommended. At 41LL490, a pair of possible bedrock grinding features and the
surrounding shallowly buried bedrock is recommended for avoidance from structure placement and heavy
vehicular traffic. Additional investigations should be considered if avoidance becomes impossible.
One trash scatter (41MS90) and an isolated well (41LL4881) were recorded. The trash scatter is
considered to be fully documented and no additional investigations are considered necessary. The well is
recommended for avoidance, with possible additional investigations if avoidance is not possible.
Site 41MS87 is a prehistoric burned rock midden that may date to the Late Prehistoric period and a set of
features associated with building and occupation of nearby Fort Mason. The burned rock midden is
composed of sandstone and appears undisturbed. The historic features consist of two open limekilns and
two possible sentry or outlook stations. The features within this site are recommended for full and careful
avoidance, as they are considered to be eligible for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks and,
in the case of the historic features, are contributing members to the Fort Mason National Register
property. Avoidance will be accomplished through close coordination with LCRA TSC. If avoidance
becomes impossible, then additional investigations and mitigation are warranted.
No artifacts were collected during this project, and no curation will be necessary.

Environmental Background
The project area is completely within the Llano Uplift, or Central Mineral Region, of the Edwards
Plateau. The primary geology consists of Precambrian granitic rocks, primarily Town Mountain Granite
and younger intrusive granite, and members associated with earlier Packsaddle, Schist, Lost Creek Gneiss
and Valley Spring Gneiss (Barnes 1981). The Llano Uplift is an area of a relatively thick layer of
relatively low density granite that tends to float on the Earth’s mantle (Reed 2007). Over geologic time,
sandstones and limestones have formed around and in some cases on top of the uplift, but have always
been subject to erosion, maintaining the distinctive nature of the region. Chert-bearing deposits are rare,
and appear as small pockets of Fluviatile terrace deposits, stream gravels in portions of the Llano and
Colorado rivers, and isolated occurrences of remnant Edwards formation limestone.
Soils within the project area are primarily of the Castell-Keese series, which formed from weathered
granite and gneiss, although the area around Llano is covered by Ligon-Katemcy series soils, which
formed from weathered gneiss, sandstone and limestone (Goerdel, 2000). (Mason County soils have not
yet been fully mapped, but the underlying geology clearly indicates they are similar.) Castell-Keese soils
are brown to dark brown sandy loams over sandy clays or decomposing granite. Castell soils tend to be
shallow, about 20 cm, over clay, while Keese soils can be deeper, up to 50 cm, over weathered granite.
Ligon soils are shallow to very shallow, about 10 cm, over clays. Katemcy soils are about 20 cm thick
over sandy clay loam and sandy clay.
The climate is typically hot during the summer and mild during the winter, with rain heaviest during late
spring and early fall (Goerdel 2000). The amount of available moisture (a little over 26 inches annually)
supports range vegetation, but common crops require irrigation. The growing season is typically between
April and October.
The vegetation is described as Live Oak-Mesquite Parks (McMahon et. al 1984), a somewhat open
canopy environment associated with various oaks, elm, hickory, whitebrush, agarito, persimmon, and
various grasses. This particular assemblage is largely limited to the Llano Uplift.
For much of the length of the transmission line, it runs parallel with the Llano River, at a distance of two
to three miles. The line crosses Pecan, Johnson, Fernando, Elm and Weide creeks in Llano County, and
Martin, Herman, Willow and Comanche creeks in Mason County. Numerous smaller tributaries are also
present, with the more westerly Mason County having a greater abundance and diversity in water sources,
primarily in the form of springs, such as Hick Springs near Mason.

Historic Background
Beginning in 1842, a group of twenty-one German nobles established the Society for the Protection of
German Immigrants in Texas (Adelsverein), which was committed to establishing a formal German
community in Texas (Brister 2002). The plan was to bring underemployed German workers to Texas,
which would provide the workers economic opportunities, and would also strengthen Germany’s
industrial capabilities as well as provide profits for shareholders in the Adelsverein. The effort lasted
until 1853, when it was essentially bankrupted. Despite this, it was able to bring in over 7,000 German
settlers and create lasting momentum for continued German immigration.
Immigrants typically arrived in Indianola, and the first group, led by Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels
settled at New Braunfels and 1845. In 1846, John O. Meusebach, who succeeded Solms as general
commissioner, settled at Fredericksburg. In 1847 five settlements were established along the Llano River,
only one of which, Castell (named for Adelsverein business manager Count Carl of Castell-Castell),

221

survived. The community known as Art was also established by Germans in 1856, and was known
originally as Willow Creek or Upper Willow Creek. The 1890s era map refers to it as Hoersterville.
Families settled up and down the creek for some 10 miles (Rhoades 2006).
German immigrants therefore broke ground in the Llano and Mason county area, but despite a treaty
between Muesebach and the Comanche, there was still widespread depredation, and with the area still on
the edge of the western frontier, the selection of the location for Fort Mason in 1851 provided security
and encouraged settlement by additional Germans as well as Irish and English (Rhoades 2006).
Fort Mason was relatively short-lived and was occupied intermittently, its first closure in 1854 (DeVos
2006). It was reoccupied in 1856, when it was at its greatest population. It was during this period that the
future generals Albert Sidney Johnstone and Robert E. Lee, among others, served there. In 1861 the fort
was held by secessionists, and for a time held suspected Union sympathizers as prisoners. In 1866 the
fort was reoccupied by the United States, and a renewed effort was made to rein in marauding Indians.
However, Reconstruction efforts apparently led to low morale and widespread desertions. Fort Mason
was finally closed in 1869, and the buildings were recycled into numerous buildings in the adjacent town.
Mason was chosen as the county seat in 1861 (Rhoades 2006) although it is unclear when it was first
settled. Llano appears to have been established in 1856, but was simply a frontier outpost into the 1870s.
Mason, at the time, was thriving. Mason County was often troubled by lawlessness associated with cattle
raising. There were conflicts with sheepherders, rustlers, fence cutters and with frictions between
Germans and Anglo Americans. Antipathy towards people of German descent was evidenced during the
two World Wars as well.
The Central Texas Mineral Region (Llano Uplift) led a number of speculators to the area, and at one point
Llano was marketed as the Pittsburg of the west (Heckert-Greene 2006). Granite, however, was the only
resource that was available in sufficient quantities to make a significant economic impact.
Both counties are still heavily reliant on ranching and farming, with tourism and deer hunting providing
substantial additional revenues.

Prehistoric Background
It does not appear that the prehistory of the Llano Uplift has been systematically examined, and although
the unique combinations of geology, climate and soils would almost certainly lead to local adaptations,
the broad chronologies established for central Texas are generally applicable.
Examples of prehistoric site types in Central Texas are camps, caches, interments, cemeteries, kill/butcher
locales, quarry/workshops, lithic scatters, and rock art sites (Collins 1995:363). The numerous
excavations of major campsites conducted along the larger streams and rivers (cf. Peter et al. 1982;
Prewitt 1981) have demonstrated that Central Texas was occupied for at least 13,000 years prior to the
coming of Europeans. Generally accepted prehistoric chronological divisions are as follows: Paleoindian
(pre-6800 B.C.), Early Archaic (6800 B.C. - 4000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (4000 B.C. - 2000 B.C.), Late
Archaic (2000 B.C. - A.D. 700), and Late Prehistoric (A.D. 700 - 1600) (Collins 1995).

Previous Investigations
There are 486 recorded archaeological sites in Llano County, 98 of which are listed as State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs). In Mason County there 83 recorded archaeological sites, two of which

222

are SALs. One reason for the great discrepancy in the number of sites between the two counties is the
extensive work done at Enchanted Rock State Park, where approximately 268 sites are recorded in the
Llano County portion of the park. Another 120 or so sites are located along the Colorado River and
associated lakes in Llano County. The Llano Uplift Archeological Society has also recorded a number of
sites in the Llano area, and a property once owned by LCRA nears Scott’s Crossing had 12 sites recorded.
The additional number of recorded sites in Llano County appears to be a function of an increased amount
of work combined with the number of highly favorable conditions along the Colorado River. Additional
intensive surveys along the Llano River in Mason County potentially could produce a large number of
previously unknown archaeological sites (as this project demonstrates).
About 30 sites are located within a distance of two miles from the project area. Only three of these are in
Mason County, one being Fort Mason and another, 41MS70, a mortar site documented by the Texas
Archeological Stewards network, located on Comanche Creek north of Mason. 41MS67 is also known as
the Hoerster Cache, a collection of 18 thin bifaces found during a bulldozing operation. These were
interpreted as trade blanks, and were in soil as deep as three feet near the base of a prominent hill.
Fort Mason (41MS30) was investigated in the late 1980s prior to water pipeline construction (Jaquier
1991). Jaquier was able to confirm aspects of the original layout of the fort and recovered numerous
associated artifacts. As a result, the fort area was added to the Mason National Register district.
Near Llano are several sites recorded by the Llano Uplift Archeological Society (LUAS). These include
open campsites and bedrock mortar sites and lithic scatters. Also in this area are some early trinomials
for which little information is available, although some were recorded by A. T. Jackson, presumably in
the 1930s.
In the 1990s LCRA acquired 955 acres of property on the Llano River near Scott’s Crossing. Intended to
be a park, the property was finally sold. However, a relatively intensive archaeological survey was
conducted by LCRA archaeologist and LUAS members, resulting in the recording of 10 prehistoric and
two historic sites.
One of the historic sites, 41LL428, consists of a small cement slab inscribed with the name and date
“Morris A. Fry, 5 Oct 1945” and has the imprints of a child’s hands and feet. It is in close proximity to a
more modern pole barn, and indicates a continuum in land use. The other historic site, 41LL435, is a
historic mine shaft of unknown age, but assumed to date to the early 1900s. The shaft is approximately
five feet in height and six feet in width, and slopes downwards at a 45-degree angle for a distance of
approximately 50 feet before hitting the water table. It is unknown whether it extends further. Such
features are known as “incline shaft” mines. No substantial artifacts are known to be associated with the
mine.
Eight of the ten prehistoric sites were described as lithic scatters. 41LL432 is a lithic scatter near a
granite outcrop that contains possible mortar holes. At least two open camps were also recorded. A
number of time-diagnostic artifacts were noted across the tract. These indicate prehistoric settlement
beginning as early as 8000 years ago and continuing until European settlement of the region. Some
patterns of land use can be surmised based on site distributions, particularly 41LL429 and 41LL426.
They suggest that persons were living very near the river, but conducting substantial activities in more
upland settings. It is interesting that the activity level appears so high at 41LL426, which is at some
distance from the river. This may be explained to some extent by the occurrence of natural water-holding
basins, or tinajas, within the granite outcrops, and by the elevated nature of the landform, which would
have provided good opportunities for observing game and other visitors in the area. The remainder of the
sites provide evidence for the spatial distribution of activities, and to some extent hint at landform use
over time.

223

Research Design and Field Methods
The archaeological survey was conducted to identify and evaluate archaeological sites within the existing
transmission line corridor that might be eligible for State Archeological Landmark status and would be
impacted by transmission line construction.
High probability areas were assessed based primarily on proximity to stream crossings and on favorable
topographic relief. Turn-of-the-century maps were also referenced to assess the potential for historic
homesites. Of the total 33.9 miles of ROW, 14.4 miles (43 percent) were designated as high probability
areas. Following minimum survey standards, 230 shovel tests would be expected. Given the
combination of often excellent visibility in fairly shallow soils that number was adjusted in the field, with
an emphasis on testing terraces with soil accumulation and in recognized archaeological sites where
visibility or soil depth indicated such testing was desirable. A total of 92 tests were ultimately excavated
(see Figures 96-98).
Survey was accomplished by groups of two to four archaeologists walking random transects within
existing ROW. Special attention was paid to the ROW edge within the Castell to Fort Mason (50 ft wide
ROW) section, where there is potential for construction activities to inadvertently move outside the ROW.
USGS maps and aerial imagery were the primary sources of ground orientation. Records were kept as
field notes, site sketch maps, shovel test records, photographs and GPS logs. Due to the location of the
project on private property, a no-collection policy was maintained throughout. Artifacts from shovel tests
were analyzed in the field and returned to the earth with backdirt.

Results of Investigations
41LL488
41LL488 is a light lithic scatter located between transmission support structures (STRs) 2/8 and 2/7, just
west of Pecan Creek (Figure 99). It is within shallow silty clays with sparse vegetation and excellent
visibility. A freshly bladed private road crossed under the ROW at the eastern edge of the site, just prior
to the rocky descent to the creek (Figure 100). Two shovel tests were excavated to very shallow depths
where dense gravels were encountered. The site consists of two flakes, the non-diagnostic proximal
portion of a dart point, and a core, within a 95 m length within the ROW. The complete lack of naturally
occurring chert in this region makes this more obvious as an archaeological site, as opposed to scattered
isolated objects. This lithic scatter provides some minimal locational information, but is considered to be
fully investigated within the ROW and ineligible for formal SAL listing.
41LL489
41LL489 is a light lithic scatter located just east of a short unnamed tributary to San Fernando Creek, and
west of STR 8/4. It is within shallow silt loams over coarse reddish clays with a moderate cover of
grasses, mesquite and cacti (Figure 101). A low granite ridge or outcrop which runs diagonally
north/south under the transmission line marks the western edge of the site (Figure 102). Three shovel
tests found silty soils to depths of 15-50 cm over gravels or red coarse clays. Shovel Test 6, on the
eastern edge of the site recovered two chunks, a thin flake, and a flake fragment in 50 cm of soil. Shovel
Test 7, near the site center, was negative. Shovel Test 8, near the granite outcrop, had one burned chert
fragment that may have been a biface, the proximal end of a thin biface, possibly a wide projectile base,
and some angular (possibly burned) granite. Another three flakes were seen across the ground surface,

conclusive evidence. The shallow nature of the soils and limited amount of artifacts limit this site’s
research potential within the ROW strictly to locational information. The site is not considered eligible
for formal SAL listing.
41LL490
41LL490 is a light lithic scatter and possible bedrock mortar site located on the high inside bend of the
same drainage as 41LL489, about 250 m further to the west (Figure 103). A granite outcrop is on the
northern edge of the ROW in this area, and is within 40 m of the creek, which although dry at the time of
survey, has the potential to hold pools of water when flowing. Three flakes were seen on the surface
nearby, where short grasses and limited soil allowed for excellent visibility. One shovel test was
excavated through 15 cm of loamy silt to granite bedrock. There was no recovery. Two possible bedrock
features were seen. One was a surface of extremely smooth granite located at the interface of the bedrock
and the soil. It was partially exposed by removing some of the soil by hand, and did not appear to be
more than 30 cm in diameter, with no definite shape, and no dish. The smooth surface graded very
quickly into the surrounding, weathered bedrock. The second feature was located on fully exposed
granite. It was oval in shape, about 25 x 15 cm in size, and dished perhaps 2 cm at its deepest.
Unfortunately, it was as severely weathered as the surrounding granite, so it cannot definitely be
classified as a cultural feature. The slick is also enigmatic, but it seems unlikely that this feature is
natural. The general nature of the site suggests low research potential, especially based on the lack of
associated artifacts. However, additional features may be present in the buried bedrock (Figure 104). For
this reason, it will be recommended that structure placement not be permitted here, and that vehicular
traffic follow the existing ROW road through this area. If this is not possible, then additional testing and
exposure of the buried bedrock may be necessary.

41LL491
41LL491 is a light lithic scatter located on an overlook on the east side of San Fernando Creek 1600
meters upstream from the Hwy 29 bridge (Figure 105). Large rounded granite outcrops strewn with
boulders cover much of the slope leading up to the crest of the overlook where most of the cultural
material was found (Figure 106). The area is mostly open, due in part to the extensive rock exposures as
well as the previous clearing for the transmission line ROW. The surrounding area is essentially a
grassland with scattered moderate-sized live oaks, persimmon and mesquite. There are areas of thick
whitebrush and tasajillo, particularly along the north side of the ROW, suggesting past disturbances
possibly from brush clearing during transmission line construction.
The artifacts at the site occur in two areas, the crest of the hill (overlook) in the area adjacent to STR 10/6
and on a kind of bench on the slope below a short distance to the west of the overlook. On the surface of
the overlook two flakes and a fragment of a side scraper were found. Four shovel tests were placed in the
rocky loamy soils on the overlook with two of the tests encountering bedrock less than 10 cm below the
surface without artifact recovery. The other two tests were placed in areas with pockets of soil and each
reached a depth of 40 cm before striking bedrock. Both these tests recovered moderate amounts of
debitage.
On the bench below, several flakes were noted along with a core. The bench, essentially a shelf of granite
thinly covered by soil, was not shovel tested. The granite exposures around the bench were inspected for
bedrock features such as mortar holes and none were found.

The artifact recovery from this site suggests light use as a locale for making and refurbishing stone tools.
Its elevated position close to water apparently made it a moderately attractive place to conduct such
activity. The lack of features and thin, sparse cultural deposits offer little potential for research. The site
is not considered eligible for formal SAL listing.
41LL492
This site contains a buried lithic scatter to the east of STR 11/2 within a meander of a small, dry tributary
creek of San Fernando Creek (Figure 107). It is located 600 meters west of the sand-choked bed of San
Fernando Creek and 1300 meters north of Hwy 29. The vegetation within the cleared ROW consists of
short grasses and forbs while the surrounding area is mostly open as well with scattered mesquite and
small live oaks. Live oaks are especially numerous close to the creek.
The site was detected by shovel testing. The first test placed at the site encountered sand or loamy sand to
a depth of at least 60 cm. Two pieces of debitage were recovered from between 40 and sixty 60 cm.
Possibly both came from a thin layer of quartz cobbles encountered at 50 cm, although these rocks did not
appear burned. Apparently only a relatively small area of the site is covered by this sandy soil – perhaps
only the area closest to the creek – since the other five shovel tests placed nearby encountered clay
between 10 and 20 cm below the surface. One of these tests recovered a chip in the loamy soil above the
clay while the rest were all negative.

The site contains a very low density of buried debitage. Artifacts are confined to the south end of the
ROW and probably extend southwards a short distance to the creek channel. Elsewhere within the ROW
the soils are shallow and generally devoid of cultural material. The site is not considered eligible for
formal SAL listing.

41LL493
This is a light lithic scatter spread out across both sides of a meander of a dry creek 1300 meters upstream
from 41LL492 (Figure 108). It lies 1500 meters west of San Fernando Creek and 1400 meters north of
Hwy 29. The surrounding area is a grassland with scattered mesquite and live oak. Some superficial
erosion is present on the sloping ground leading down to the creek channel, particularly adjacent to the
low granite outcrops
The artifacts were seen on the surface on both sides of the creek channel. One arrow point, one uniface,
and two pieces of debitage were found on the east side of the creek and one biface fragment, one edge
modified flake, and two pieces of debitage were found on the west side east of STR 11/7. No shovel
testing was done because of the thin soils. The arrow point (Figure 109) probably belongs to the Scallorn
style but identity is uncertain because the stem is incomplete.
Because of the low number of artifacts and their disturbed surface context, little additional information
will come from further investigation. Information already recorded can be added to that of other sites in
the area to show large scale patterns of land use. The site is not considered eligible for formal SAL
listing.

). The plant community outside the cleared ROW might best be called an
open oak/juniper woodland. Cultural material is densest upslope on the upper terrace
terrace-like slope between
STR 18/6 and a stock pond and appears to increase towards the south, perhaps indicating that the main
site area lies in that direction. Shovel test profiles show a soil typically consisting of 35 cm thick surface
zone of reddish brown sandy loam over red clay or granite gravels. A few shovel tests encountered
thicker surface zones of sandy loam, up to 75 cm thick.

Figure 110. Site 41LL494.

Artifacts noted on the surface include a Nolan point, a burin-faceted
burin faceted flake shaped like a projectile point, a
thin biface fragment possibly from an arrow point, a thicker bi
biface
face fragment, a core or chopper, and 10 to
15 pieces of debitage (Figure 111).
111 No burned rocks were seen.

232

Of the seven tests placed in the site, six recovered artifacts. Nearly all the recovery consisted of debitage
except for the distal fragment of a thin projectile point, possibly an arrow point, recovered from Level 1
(0-20cm) of ST42. An average debitage count of approximately five flakes/chips/chunks came from the
positive tests, generally well-distributed depth-wise throughout the loamy surface zone.
The presence of a Nolan point from the Middle Archaic and a probable arrow point fragment shows that
site was visited during at least two separate periods and perhaps on other occasions owing to its location
near the confluence of two streams. These visits were probably brief in that no evidence of cooking was
found and were possibly related to hunting activities because of the evidence of weapon refurbishing.
Because of the shallow deposits and presumed mixing of material from different cultural groups, little
additional information could be gathered from further investigation within the ROW. The site is not
considered eligible for formal SAL listing.

41LL495
This site is a prehistoric lithic scatter located on the west side of Elm Creek 200 meters upstream from the
mouth of Weide Creek (Figure 112). Most of the artifacts lie buried east of STR 18/2 within a gentle
slope leading down to Elm Creek. Trees and dense brush grow along the edge of the sand-choked creek;
these have been cleared within the ROW leaving an opening to the creek presently blocked by a wire
fence enclosure. The immediate site area is currently used as pasture and appears to have once been
cultivated although mesquite is now beginning to grow in places. The soils consist of sandy loams at
least 75cm thick over gravel at the east end closest to the creek. The loams become somewhat thinner
westwards.
One burned flake was recovered from a depth of between 60 and 75 cm in ST 44 placed 40 meters east of
the creekbed. A second test (ST45) placed 115 meters from the creek recovered one flake between 0 and
20 cm and another flake between 20 and 40 cm below surface. In addition to the shovel test recovery,
two flakes were noted on the surface between the two tests.
The low density of observed and recovered artifacts indicates the research value of this site is low within
and adjacent to the present ROW. The site is not considered eligible for formal SAL listing.
41MS87
41MS87 is a multicomponent site located along a short unnamed tributary to Comanche Creek. It is
located on generally sloping ground at the base of Post Hill, about 2,000 ft southeast of where Fort Mason
stood (Figure 113, and see Figure 138). Soils are shallow and visibility is mostly excellent.

thin distal tips and a probable uniface were seen. A return visit located a side-notched arrow point, a very
thin biface, probably an arrow point preform (Figure 114), and the medial section of a narrow, relatively
thick (1.5 cm) well made biface, which is probably a knife. The midden is located about 4 vertical meters
above the creek, and about 40 m horizontally. It is about 8 m in diameter. A single shovel test (ST 52)
was excavated to a depth of 70 cm and encountered dense burned sandstone in a dark, ashy matrix. Three
burned flakes were recovered from a depth of 50 cm. This shovel test did not encounter the bottom of the
midden. Another shovel test, ST 51, was placed about 9 m from the midden where a few flakes were
noted. Ten flakes, all but one from the upper 20 cm were recovered along with a couple of chunks and a
few pieces of angular sandstone. The soil was a fine brown sandy loam.

The historic component consists of a light scatter of glass, ceramics and metal and at least two, and
perhaps four, sandstone features. Two of the features are simple, open lime kilns that are clearly
associated with the construction and/or maintenance of Fort Mason. They are located about 12 m
(Feature 2) and 30 m (Feature 1) east-southeast of STR 1/4 (Figure 115), and are in or overlap the
southern one-half of the 50-foot ROW. Both are semi-circular dry-laid arrangements of sandstone
apparently built into the excavated edge of the creek bank (Figure 116). They are about 4 m in outside
diameter, and about 1.5 m deep. Both open towards the creek, with an apparent operating area on the
lower creek terrace. Both were partially filled with collapsed blocks and an ingrowth of small woody
vegetation. Once vegetation was cleared, Feature 1 took on a definite horseshoe shape in plan view
(Figure 117). Feature 2 has a partially processed piece of limestone within it (Figure 118). On the
upslope side both appear to have been backfilled with sandstone rubble and burned soil. Black midden
soil surrounds Feature 2.
Three shovel tests were excavated. Shovel Test 48 was placed in the mounded area directly north of the
stacked sandstone of Feature 1. It encountered 10 cm of dark ashy soil that became a light mottled soil
with large rocks. The test was terminated at 20 cm. Shovel Test 49 was placed within the dark soil ring
north of Feature 2. It encountered 18 cm of very dark ashy soil with some burned limestone over 12 cm
of mottled brown fine sandy loam. Shovel Test 50 was placed on the lower terrace near the opening of
Feature 1. It was excavated through 20 cm of dark brown fine sandy loam before a large root was
encountered. A single piece of thin rusted flat metal was recovered. Casual inspection of the creek bank
outside the ROW found a short tubular piece of probable hand-forged iron, about 4 inches in length and
about 2.5 in diameter. A piece of aqua glass was seen at a depth of 50 cm in the cutbank. On top of
Feature 2 were two pieces of blue glass. Elsewhere within the ROW was seen one piece of purple glass, a
few scattered pieces of white stoneware, and an aqua bottle base. These were mostly associated with the
small creek channel.

A third possible feature is located about 10 m west of STR 1/4, on the north edge of the ROW. It is a
rectangular arrangement of sandstone, open to the north (upslope, towards the fort). Nearby were two
pieces of white stoneware and two pieces of aqua glass. A return visit after a period of rain located four
or five more sherds, including two blue featheredge rim pieces. Although there is no stacking on this
feature – it is flush with the ground surface – nearby stones may once have been incorporated. This
feature may be a fortuitous arrangement of stones left after bulldozing which was occurred within the
ROW. It may also represent some sort of fortification or sentry post.
A return visit to more fully document the lime kilns resulted in the recording of an additional apparent
feature (Feature 4). It consisted of a stacked stone alignment consisting of two to three courses of drylaid sandstone on the north side of the ROW (Figure 119). It was about 2 m in length, running more or
less parallel with the creek. Sandstone rubble formed an area about 2 m on a side below it. Nearby was a
black glass kick-up bottle base and a white stoneware sherd with blue Chinese transfer decoration. Like
Feature 3, this may be a fortuitous arrangement and has also been largely destroyed be recent and past
bulldozing and other disturbances. It may also represent some sort of activity area such as a guard post.
Features 3 and 4 are 500 feet (150 m) apart. Also noted was an apparent lime dump along the creek bank
where the ROW crosses (Figure 120)

Figure 119. Site 41MS87, stone alignment at Feature 4, looking generally north. Scale in 30 cm increments.

According to Wilburn Shearer, a local acquaintance of archaeologist Glenn Goode, the lime kilns are
well-known by many in the community. At least one more is reported to be located downstream from the
two reported here, outside the ROW. Reportedly, soldiers at the fort traveled to a limestone source to the
south, then returned to the fort area and took advantage of nearby springs for water. Jaquier notes that
lime for mortar was “surely extracted from limestone in local limekilns,” (Jaquier 1991:5) although he
apparently was not aware of these features. An outcrop of Cap Mountain Limestone is located about 1
mile south of the fort. Potentially higher quality Glen rose formation limestone surrounds much of the
Llano Uplift, and is mapped as near as 12-13 miles to the south.

238

Features of both components at this site are considered to be eligible for formal listing as State
Archeological Landmarks. The limekilns are associated with National Register property Fort Mason, and
as such are contributing members, and likely are NR eligible as well. The possible fortifications,
however, may be too disturbed to ever be able to clearly interpret. The burned rock midden is unique to
the immediate study area, and could provide valuable new information on land use. All five features are
recommended for full avoidance which will be accomplished through close coordination between LCRA
Archaeology Services and LCRA TSC. If avoidance becomes impossible, then additional investigations
and mitigation will be warranted.

41MS88
41MS88 is located about 1 km east of the Fort Mason substation on the east side of an unnamed dry
tributary to Comanche Creek that is fed by the mapped Hick Springs (Figure 121). It consists of a
concentration flakes seen on exposed bedrock surfaces within an approximate 60 m distance under the
transmission line. Approximately 30-40 flakes were seen, almost all decorticate and most appearing to be
the result of soft hammer reduction. The distal portion of a probably projectile point was also seen, as
was a point that had been reworked into a drill or perforator. The drill was not typeable, but the dart point
base was suggestive of Middle Archaic styles. A single piece of dark olive glass was also noted.
Shovel Test 55 was excavated within the site near the main flake concentration, and recovered three
chunks, three chips and a flake in 30 cm of soil over bedrock. Due to the shallow soils, exposed bedrock
and generally excellent visibility, no additional shovel tests were attempted.

This lithic scatter appears to represent a workstation established on stable ground above the Hick Springs
tributary. The single piece of glass does not constitute a component. Given the shallow nature of the
soils and lack of materials other than chert, the research potential for this site is considered to be low, and
no additional investigations within or near the present ROW are warranted. The site is not considered
eligible for formal SAL listing.
41MS89
This site consists of a single masonry well (Figure 122, Figure 123, Figure 123). It is located extremely
close – a distance of four meters - to the east cutbank of Willow Creek and lies completely within the
south half of the ROW. The well is constructed of roughly dressed boulder-sized rocks, mostly sandstone
but some shale or schist, laid in lime and gravel mortar. More recent repairs using concrete are evident.
Some of the stone blocks on the exterior show obvious chisel marks. In plan view, the exterior of the
well is a square five feet on a side while the interior (hole) is round with a diameter of 27 inches. The
well shaft continues straight down at the same diameter as the opening for as far as could be seen with the
available light, at least 15 feet, and is lined with stone blocks.
Although the well is located in close proximity to the creek, the vegetation in the area is completely xeric,
consisting of scattered mesquite, cactus, and grasses. A small hackberry tree is growing out of the well
shaft. The adjacent creekbed is typical for the granite region in being relatively wide and choked with
granitic sand. No water was running in the streambed at the time of the survey.

The only artifact seen on the surface in association with the well was a cedar fence post lying along the
west side of the well. The cutbank provided an excellent profile of the soil in proximity to the well down
to a depth of five feet. The soil consists of coarse sand and pebbles deposited by the stream in
geologically recent times. It appears that the well was dug into these sediments. No artifacts were seen in
the cutbank.
The well is located on a 700 acre piece of land that was on of several surveyed by Fisher and Miller in the
1840s, and was part of some 3 million acres between the Colorado and Llano Rivers granted to Henry
Francis Fisher, Burchard Miller and Joseph Baker, who planned to bring in settlers as part of the San Saba

241

Colonization Company. The grant was eventually sold in its entirety to the Adelsverein (see Historic
background section), although Fisher remained on the Society’s board. The community of Castell was
one of the only successful colonization efforts. Many of the settlers associated with the original grant
moved to New Braunfels and Frederickburg, selling the more rural properties (Biesele 2006).
The present landowner, Ms. Sarah Stahl, is a direct descendent of the original settler of the property.
According to Ms. Stahl, and information gathered from the Mason County Rootsweb site
http://www.txgenweb2.org/txmason/ , Anton Willmann was born in 1810 in Prussia. He had five children
with his first wife Theresa Knolle, including August, the youngest of the five, who was born in 1851 in
Prussia. Sometime before 1856 he was married to Christina Niez in Texas, and eight more children were
born. Family tradition states that the Willmann House, which is about 500 ft north of the well, was
constructed about 1865 and was originally a stone dogtrot configuration. However, the 1932 obituary for
August states that the Willmann family settled near New Braunfels, and that as a young man August
moved to Mason County. He married in 1878, and moved to the house above Art in 1879. Ms. Stahl’s
father, William Willmann, was born in the house in 1895 and died in 1970. The property has since been
deeded to Ms. Stahl. The house is still serviceable and is used as a hunting lodge and family retreat.
The lime mortar and chiseled stones indicate the well is old. It probably dates to the time of original
construction of the house, sometime between about 1865 and 1879. The feature deserves protection
because of its age and unusual design and the LCRA’s Archeology Services will coordinate with TSC
staff to ensure its protection.
41MS90
The site consists of a light scatter of late 19th or early 20th century trash along the south side of a stone
fence located one mile north of the town of Art on the east side of North Art Road (Figure 125). It lies at
the crest of a long slope which leads down into the narrow valley of an unnamed creek. The surrounding
countryside is mostly grassland with scattered live oak and cactus. The slope is rocky with frequent
outcrops and little soil cover.
The artifact inventory includes two fragments of amethyst bottle glass, two fragments of aqua bottle glass,
two fragments of milk glass, and one cut nail. This material was all seen south of the stone fence; no
artifacts were noted north of the fence. The stone fence begins on the east side of North Art Road and
runs eastwards for a considerable distance. The fence is made up of undressed boulder-sized rocks that
appear to metamorphic. Close to the road the stones are no longer stacked and lie where they have fallen
– a modern wire fence has been constructed on the rubble. An underground concrete box-like feature is
located within the fenceline 45 meters north of the trash scatter. It is approximately 10 feet long and 6
feet wide. The walls are approximately 6 inches thick and continue into the ground to an unknown depth.
The feature is filled with rocks apparently from the stone fence. This feature resembles a cattleguard
without the grate.
The cut nail was the only evidence that a house may have once stood in the area. No other signs of house
were seen within or adjacent to the ROW. The site is not considered eligible for formal SAL listing.
41MS91
41MS91 is a lithic scatter located on a bend of Little Willow Creek near its juncture with Willow Creek
(Figure 126). It is upon a granite outcrop in an area with little to no soil, and no shovel tests were
considered necessary. The site is about 280 m in length along the ROW, although the vast majority of
material is within the 140 m between STR 7/3 and Little Willow Creek. About 30 flakes and chips, all
with characteristics of soft hammer percussion were seen along with two thin bifaces, an unidentifiable

but probable Late Archaic dart point and a possible small granite mano. No grinding surfaces were noted
on the bedrock. There was also a polyhedral quartz crystal seen. These probably occur naturally in the
area, but no formations have been seen during the survey. It was almost certainly imported by site
residents. The site appears to be a workstation or possible hunting camp. There is little research value
beyond what was gathered during its recording, and no additional work is considered necessary within or
near the present ROW. The site is not considered eligible for formal SAL listing.
41MS92
41MS92 hugs an inside meander of an unnamed tributary to Weide Creek, just west of the Mason/Llano
County line (Figure 127). It is bordered on the east by an erosional gully that feeds the creek, very near
the location of STR 17/2. A granite outcrop is located on the south side of the ROW. The site is about 30
m in length under the ROW. Materials seen included some 15-20 flakes, almost all interior and resulting
from soft hammer percussion. The distal portion of a fairly large biface was noted. It was about 5 cm
wide and 1.5-2 cm thick, and appears to have snapped during reduction. This was almost certainly a
multipurpose tool designed for continued use through reduction at locales distant from chert resources.
Two shovel tests (STs 82 and 83) were excavated west of the site, where there appeared to be more soil.
These were excavated to 30 and 20 cm, respectively, the first in clay and the second in extremely dense
silty loam. A number of erosional features in the immediate area showed no evidence of buried material.

This site appears to be a short term processing or hunting camp. There is little research value beyond
what was gathered during its recording, and no additional work is considered necessary within or near the
present ROW. The site is not considered eligible for formal SAL listing.

244

41MS93
41MS93 is a light, mostly buried lithic scatter located along the edge of Sand Creek, nears its juncture
with a short unnamed tributary (Figure 128, Figure 129). The site does not extend past Sand Creek to the
east, at about the location of STR 15/5. As the name of the creek implies, soils here are very sandy and
fairly deep. The eastern half of the site is in gray loamy sand with extends for some 60 m from the creek
bank westward, where more sallow, reddish sands are encountered. It is at this point where the land
begins sloping upwards towards a granite outcrop that contains STR 15/3. The last cultural material was
seen about 20 m east of this structure. Observed material included an Edwards arrow point (see Figure
35), a very few flakes (4-5) on the surface, and a possible uniface. Two shovel tests, STs 84 and 85, were
excavated in the eastern, deeper portion of the site. ST 84 was excavated through 55 cm of pale yellowish
brown loamy sand and terminated in dense reddish clay At about 50 cm a single burned chert chip was
recovered. ST 85 was excavated through 70 cm of similar matrix, although clay was not encountered.
No shovel tests were attempted in the more shallow reddish soils.
This light lithic scatter probably represents a processing station or hunting camp. It may be an outlier of
the more upland 41MS94, located on the next ridge about 300 m west of Sand Creek. Given the low
return in the two shovel tests, there is nothing to suggest that more substantial materials remain buried.
The site is useful for the single time-diagnostic artifact that places one period of use during the early part
of the Late Prehistoric period. However, there is little research value beyond what was gathered during
its recording, and no additional work is considered necessary within or near the present ROW. The site is
not considered eligible for formal SAL listing.

41MS94
41MS94 is a lithic scatter located on an upland ridge in exposed granite bedrock with a prominent granite
outcrop (Figure 130). Named the 1,000 Flake Site in the field, it probably had fewer than that number,
but was still remarkable for the relatively large number of flakes seen there, many more than was typical
for the rest of the project area. The flakes were mostly clustered within the granite outcrop (Figure 131),
which also held a modern deer blind. In addition to the flakes, two thin biface tips, one an apparent drill
or perforator were seen. A few flakes were scattered westward for a distance of about 130 m. The
exposed bedrock in places had developed erosional gullies, and in one location there was a fairly
substantial tinaja, which despite the long-term drought at the time of the survey, still held a foot or more
of water and was supporting hydric plants (Figure 132). Water stains on boulders within the feature
indicated that it typically holds four ft or so of water in an area about 10 ft in diameter, i.e., several
hundred gallons.
This site is most likely a hunting station or camp, situated where there was good vantage point was well
as cover, with the bonus of a reliable water supply. Given the location of the modern deer blind within
the outcrop, any diagnostic artifacts have probably been collected. This site is useful for its locational
information; however, there is little research value beyond what was gathered during its recording, and no
additional work is considered necessary within or near the present ROW. The site is not considered
eligible for formal SAL listing.

41MS95
41MS95 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located on the west bank of the main arm of Twelve Mile Creek
(Figure 133). Three other tributaries to the creek in this area were all found to be low-lying with little
possibility of intact archaeology. At this location, however, there was a low ridge on the creek terrace
and a gradual rise to the west prior to an interfluvial upland. After finding a very light scatter of artifacts
on the surface (a chip, about five flakes and a uniface), a total of six shovel tests (STs 97-92) were
excavated. The first one found six flakes and flake fragments and a piece possibly burned sandstone.
One other test, ST 90, found a single chip. All were excavated through 30 cm or less of gravelly reddish
sandy clay loam which graded to clay.

This light lithic scatter is probably an outlier for something more substantial, most likely located on
higher ground to the south. The portion of the site within and adjacent to the ROW is considered to be
fully recorded and no additional work is considered necessary within or near the present ROW. The site
is not considered eligible for formal SAL listing.
41MS96
41MS96 is a lithic scatter located on the east bank of a long, multi-pronged tributary of Twelve Mile
Creek (Figure 134). It consists of about 20 flakes and chips seen on the surface and lying on exposed
bedrock. Due to the excellent exposure around these outcrops and n erosional features, the creek bank,
and animal burrows, no shovel tests were attempted. The site does appear to be fairly discrete, and as
such may represent a small workstation or hunting camp. However, there is little research value beyond
what was gathered during its recording, and no additional work is considered necessary within or near the
present ROW. The site is not considered eligible for formal SAL listing.

CTEC Fort Mason Substation
Although it was considered a low probability area, the CTEC Fort Mason two-acre expansion area was
surveyed in September of 2006 (Figure 135). It was found to be on sloping land below the crest of a hill.
The ground was shallow and rocky, and had been heavily disturbed by previous construction of the
substation and nearby stock tanks. It was transected randomly by three archeologists. No shovel tests
were considered necessary. No sites were recorded.

Bodeville
The 1890’s era USGS map shows a community called Bodeville located near Martin Creek and
georeferenced between Martin and Twelve Mile Creeks about 250 m north of the transmission line.
According to Roootsweb pages
(http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~frantzen/trees/CarlBode1804.html) Carl Bode
arrived in Indianola from Germany in 1855, and by 1860 was listed on the Mason County census. He
appears to have been accompanied by his wife Charlotte and several relatives, some of whom are not on
the Mason County census until 1880. Bodes are buried in Castell and at a Bode’s Mountain, which is
located about 8 km to the northeast. The ROW in the vicinity of the georeferenced Bodeville was
windshield surveyed. Nothing was seen. The modern USG map shows “Ruins” located 2.5 km north of
the transmission line on Martin Creek. These may be the actual Bodeville, or possibly another family
settlement. Regardless, if anything is left of Bodeville there is no evidence of it within the ROW.
Isolated Finds
In addition to a few occasional flakes that were noted on the surface and could not be associated with an
archaeological site, i.e., there were not enough artifacts to warrant site designation, there were also five
shovel tests in which artifacts were recovered, but were likewise considered isolated finds.
Shovel Test 9 was located west of 41LL489 on the opposite side of its fronting drainage. Four flakes or
frags were found in the upper 40 cm. Two other shovel tests, STs 9 and 10, were excavated in the same
area and were negative.
Shovel Test 54 was in an open pasture along a low ridge overlooking the drainage containing Hick
Springs (Figure 136). Two chips were recovered at about 60 cm. Two additional shovel tests, STs 56
and 57, found no additional material.

Figure 136. Shovel Test 54.

Shovel Test 66 was located adjacent to Willow Creek. It recovered two flakes in the upper 20 cm.
Shovel Tests 71 and 72 were placed on either side of it. Shovel Tests 64, 65 and 73 were placed in the
same setting. All were negative.
Shovel Test 69 was on a narrow lobe between Martin Creek and a short, unnamed tributary. Two flake
fragments were found in the upper 20 cm. Shovel test 70 was placed adjacent to it and was negative.
These two tests covered the landform within the ROW.

250

Shovel Test 79 was placed on an inside bend of Willow Creek, just west of 41MS91. One chip was
recovered in the upper 20 cm. Shovel Tests 77 and 78 were placed on the same landform and were
negative.

Summary and Recommendations
LCRA Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) proposes to rebuild an existing transmission line that
runs between the communities of Llano and Mason in Llano and Mason Counties, Texas. A cultural
resources assessment and survey was conducted by LCRA Archaeology Services staff during July and
September of 2009. The Llano county portion of the transmission line was surveyed in July as it was
already owned by LCRA. The Mason County portion was purchased from American Electric Power
(AEP), and access was not available until September.
The survey focused on areas identified by map reviews as having a high probability (HPAs) for
containing cultural resource sites with the potential for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks
(Figure 137). Of the 33.9 miles, 14.4, or 43 percent were marked as HPAs on preliminary maps.
As a result of the investigations, 18 previously unrecorded archaeological site were assessed (Table 1).
Fifteen of the sites were lithic scatters, typified by low densities of chipping debris which led to a high
tool-to-flake ratio. Dateable tools were from Middle Archaic, Late Prehistoric and probably Late Archaic
periods. None of these sites were considered eligible for formal listing as State Archeological
Landmarks.

Figure 137. Negative Shovel Test 58 on creek bank in a high probability area.

One burned rock midden was recorded at multicomponent 41MS87. It was composed entirely of
sandstone and was in excellent condition. A side-notched arrow point and arrow point preform found
nearby suggests this feature may date to the Late Prehistoric period, although this is largely conjectural
due to the weak spatial association. This feature is considered eligible for formal listing as a State
Archeological Landmark. Avoidance during construction and future line maintenance is recommended.
One historic trash scatter was recorded. It dates to around the turn of the twentieth century. It is not
considered eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmarks.
One stone-lined well was recorded. There were no artifacts or other features associated with it, but it was
of somewhat unusual construction. This feature is considered potentially eligible for formal listing as a
State Archeological Landmark. Avoidance during construction and future line maintenance is

251

recommended. If this is not possible then additional investigations such as detailed drawings and archival
research are recommended.
The historic component at 41MS87 contains one limekiln in fair to good condition, one limekiln in fair to
poor condition, and two stone clusters, interpreted tentatively as sentry or lookout posts, are in poor to
very poor condition. The kilns clearly date to the period of occupation and probably original building of
Fort Mason in the 19850s. Unfortunately, disturbances to the site prior to LCRA’s acquisition of the line
have probably irreparably damaged the two smaller features. Despite this, all four of these features are
considered contributing members to the Fort Mason National Register of Historic Places property (Figure
138), and so are considered eligible or potentially eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological
Landmark.
From the archeological findings, the project appears to traverse an area that saw limited use throughout
the prehistoric period. Site areas are mostly small and cultural material sparse and lacking in diversity. At
all but one site, this material consists entirely of debitage and a few flake-stone tools, mostly projectile
points and bifaces. 41MS87 includes a burned rock midden and possible hearth and is the only site with
evidence of cooking activities. Groundstone artifacts were essentially absent with the few examples – one
bedrock “slick” and a mano fragment – of questionable identity. In all, the record suggests an area used
by small, mobile groups engaged primarily in hunting activities. We can infer that the area was marginal
in terms of the natural resources other than game animals important to prehistoric foragers.
The lack of reliable water sources was an obvious limiting factor. All the sites recorded during the survey
were found along sand-filled creeks and tributaries that now flow intermittently at best. None of these
streams could be counted on to supply water except during periods of heavy or consistent rains. More
reliable as water sources were the natural basins, or tinajas, in granite outcrops. These tinajas could
potentially hold rainwater for many months; one at 41MS94 still held a large amount of water after a
major drought. It is telling that this site contained the densest archeological material of any recorded
during the survey. Tinajas alone probably could not support a large group for an extended period of time
and long-term camps were probably located closer to perennial streams such as the Llano River.

Figure 138. Site 41MS87 in relation to the location of the original Fort Mason.

252

The nature of these sites is indicative of “logistical foragers” (sensu Binford 1980) where resource
acquisition forays were initiated from larger base camps. The majority of these lithic scatters are most
likely representative of small hunting camps, some of which, such as 41MS94, located in cover at a
favorable lookout spot, may have been used repeatedly over time. Other smaller sites were probable
single use events.
The presence of Late Prehistoric and Middle Archaic diagnostic artifacts suggests (but does not
demonstrate) increased land use during these times. A single artifact possibly dated to the Late Archaic
period. Although probably the result of sampling, this does create a hypothesis that could be tested within
the similar settings of the Llano Uplift.
Early settlement in Llano and Mason counties was to some extent dictated by the degree of hostilities
between largely German settlers and aggressive Indian tribes. Families apparently often clustered
together at locations such as Bodeville (see above) for mutual protection. Settlers might start off in fairly
remote locations, but many would soon move closer to population centers such as Mason. Later
development appears to have been limited, probably due to the establishment of relatively large ranches.
The result is that historic sites were rare within the project area.
The historic components associated with Fort Mason are of historic interest. Additional work around the
kilns and the two potential sentry posts may help to determine whether the kilns were used during initial
fort construction and/or subsequent rebuilding episodes.

Introduction
The LCRA is planning to clear brush in the Grelle Recreation Area on Lake Travis in Burnet County
(Figure 139). The clearing is being done to reduce the wildfire hazard created by an overgrowth of brush
and small ashe juniper trees. A Seppi mulcher attached to a skid steer will be used to clear the brush, a
method that usually causes only superficial soil disturbances. The clearing will take place in three areas of
the park designated as Area A, Area B, and Area C (Figure 140).
Study Area
Area A covers approximately 60 acres and is located in the western part of the property adjacent to the
east side of County Road 412 beginning at a point approximately 100 meters north of Mike Wall Lane
and extending northwards for a distance 870 meters to a point where the county road turns to the east to
loop around the main camping area for park visitors. Area A extends eastwards to cover most of the
wooded area between the county road and a dry right tributary of Cypress Creek.
Area B is a small circular area of less than 0.02 acre located on the east side of a large wooded ridge that
extends northwards into Lake Travis well to the north. This area is being cleared to provide space and
sky-view for a proposed GPS antenna.
Area C extends across the southern edge of the Grelle Recreation Area from CR412 on the west
eastwards to the east perimeter fence. The northern boundary to Area C follows an existing dirt road; the
southern boundary is the south perimeter fence. The area enclosed is approximately 20 acres.
The total area to be cleared during this project adds up to approximately 80 acres. As will be discussed in
the next section, most of this acreage has previously been surveyed for cultural resources.
Geology and Soils
The project area is mostly underlain by Cretaceous-age rocks belonging to the Cow Creek Limestone and
Hammett Shale formations (Barnes 1981). At the lower elevations of Area A near the base of the steep
valley walls of the tributary creek, Pennsylvanian-age Marble Falls Limestone outcrops. From field
observations, the valley walls are covered by thick beds of Pleistocene gravels.
The soils that have developed on these rocks have been mapped into four soil types or associations: Bolar
clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, Brackett-Real association, hilly, Pedernales fine sandy loam, 1 to 3
percent slopes, and Purves association, undulating (Dittemore and Allison 1979). The most areas
surveyed for this project were covered by the Brackett-Real and Purves soils which are stony and shallow.
Bolar clay loam is mapped as covering most of Area C, however shovel testing during this project
encountered soil profiles resembling Purves soils.
Management Summary
LCRA’s Community Services division sponsored the project and the archeological investigation was
done in house by LCRA’s Archeology Services. A file search showed that portions of Area A and Area C
had already been surveyed during four previous projects by Archeology Services (Malof et al. 2003,
Hixson et al. 2007, Malof and Prikryl 2008, Malof 2009). These surveys overlapped areas covered by
1979 reconnaissance-level survey conducted by Prewitt & Associates for an LCRA brush clearing project
(Prewitt and Kotter 1979) The 1979 survey recorded two sites within Area A of the present project,
41BT160 and 41BT161. No new archeological sites were recorded during the other surveys.

Site 41BT160, located at the north end of Area A, was thought by the original recorders to have intact
buried cultural deposits including a hearth feature exposed in the dirt roadbed and avoidance was
recommended during the 1979 brush clearing project. A 2007 LCRA Archeology Services survey within
the northwestern part of 41BT160 for an entrance facility and water pipeline (Malof and Prikryl 2009)
found that portion of the site area to be covered by shallow soils containing sparse debitage. No tools or
burned rocks were seen on the surface or recovered during shovel testing. The hearth feature was not
relocated and was presumably destroyed by road bladjng. In any case, the 2007 survey reinterpreted that
portion of the site as a lightly-used lithic procurement area and assessed it as ineligible for State
Archeological Landmark status (Malof and Prikryl 2009). The southern and eastern areas of 41BT160 –
as originally plotted on the TARL maps - were surveyed during a 2006 brush clearing project and a 2008
park improvement project respectively. No evidence was found during these surveys that the site
extended into those areas (Malof and Prikryl 2008, Malof 2009). From these three LCRA surveys, the
limits of 41BT160 seem to be firmly established to the area shown in Figure 2.
Site 41BT161, located within Area A 460 meters south of 41BT160, was described during the 1979
survey as “too thinly distributed to warrant further investigation.” LCRA’s Archeology Services staff
came to same conclusion when the site was relocated during a 2006 survey for a brush clearing project.
Site 41BT161 is a light scatter of debitage and a few tools confined to surface.
The south perimeter fenceline which runs along the south side of Area C was surveyed by LCRA
archeologists in 2001 as part of a fence improvement project with a 20 ft wide firebreak. No sites were
recorded.
Cultural Background
Prehistoric Background
The project area lies within the Central Texas Archeological Region, as defined by Prewitt (1981). The
concept of an “archeological region” developed at a time (1950s and 1960s) when most Texas
archaeologists held the normative view that a culture was defined by a series of shared traits. In parts of
Texas where hunter-gatherers were thought to have lived, the traits that concerned archaeologists
most were projectile point forms followed by site types and cooking features. Later, in the 1960s and
1970s, many processual archaeologists argued that culture operated as a system that allowed a population
to adapt to its environment. Since Central Texas is an environmentally diverse region, many different
cultural systems must have operated in the past. The human population in the Balcones Canyonlands
would have had a different adaptation than one that included the Mesquite Plains in their interactive
sphere. With little ethnographic data on the indigenous population of the region, research in recent
decades has focused on cultural ecology and the materialist aspects of culture, including lithic technology
(e.g. Goode in Malof et al. 2007), cooking technology (Black et al. 1997), and subsistence (Derring in
Collins et al. 1997), which can to see degree be understood using branches of the “hard” sciences.
Chronological frameworks for Central Texas have been proposed by researchers over the years, with the
one most prevalently in use being that of Johnson and Goode (1992). As with all such frameworks for the
region, projectile point forms are used as time markers to recognize various time periods and subperiods.
Historic Background
No documentation has been found indicating that anyone of Old World descent lived on the land before
Carl and Maria Grelle established their home there in 1892. Carl Grelle, in some documents referred to as
Charles Grelle, immigrated to the United States in 1859 from the Schleswig-Holstein region of Germany,
then under control of Demark. Sometime between the late 1890s and early 1910s, a large family by the

270

name Wallace lived as tenants in a house on a hill across the creek from the Grelle farmstead. Little is
known about them, and they appear to have moved away from the Spicewood area before or soon after
Carl Grelle’s death in 1911.
Ownership of the farm eventually passed on to August Grelle and his wife Donna. In 1940 just before
the property was sold to LCRA, an appraisal showed 60 acres under cultivation, another 450 acres
devoted to pasturage; 40 fruit trees and 350 pecan trees were growing on the property. The buildings then
present included the farmhouse, barn, garage, and two sheds. These were auctioned off by LCRA, the
house being sold and moved to Marble Falls and still occupied to this day.

Previous Investigations
On June 16, 1937, LCRA granted permission for the Anthropology Department of the University of
Texas to conduct an archaeological survey of the basin of the Marshall Ford Dam. The project was
funded by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and was intended to locate archaeological sites in
areas that would be inundated by the reservoir. One of the sites recorded by A. T. Jackson, the survey’s
field archaeologist, was on the east bank of Little Cypress Creek in an agricultural field owned by August
W. Grelle. Jackson reported two large burned rock middens and recommended the site for the excavation
phase of the basin survey project.
The excavations that were eventually carried out at the site were some of the largest in terms of volume of
earth moved in the history of Texas archaeology. It is now called the Grelle Site and has since been given
the trinomial of 41BT1. J. Charles Kelly, who had recently led excavations at two other sites downstream
from Grelle, supervised a team of WPA relief workers from December 1940 until funding ended four
months later.
The upland and upland margin areas of the property were surveyed for the first time during the 1979 by
Prewitt & Associates archaeologists for an LCRA brush clearing project. The survey took place over two
days and therefore was cursory at best. Still, 10 sites were recorded, most being lithic scatters or lithic
procurement sites located on the high terraces along the upland margins. In addition, the Grelle farmstead
(41BT166) was formally recorded for the first time along with another historic site (41BT168) that,
according to oral histories taken by historian Dan Utley in the 1990s, represents the site of the house that
was rented by Carl Grelle to the Wallace family.
Several more sites were recorded by LCRA staff archaeologists between 2000 and 2003, including the
first terrace site, 41BT345, since the WPA excavations. Five more terrace sites were located during the
2005/2006 inventory survey; two of these possessed burned middens and a third midden was documented
at the previously recorded 41BT345. Only superficial shovel testing was done at these sites but the
potential exists for deeply buried cultural deposits.
Methodology
The purpose of the survey was to locate unrecorded sites within the previously unsurveyed portions of the
project area and assess their potential for designation as State Archeological Landmarks. The surveyed
portions of Area A (11.9 acres), Area B (11.9 acres), and Area C (0.02 acre) add up to just under 22 acres.
All these areas were given a 100% pedestrian survey and shovel tests were placed in areas where ground
visibility was poor and free of rock outcropping. A total of four shovel test were dug, lower than the 11

271

Figure 141. Aerial showing areas surveyed for project with shovel test locations

272

shovel tests recommended for a project of this acreage because of the lack of soil cover and the generally
good visibility (Figure 141).
Results of Investigations
No archeological sites were found during the survey. Soil cover appeared shallow in all areas with
frequent exposures of bedrock. The shallow nature of the soils was substantiated by shovel testing. The
three shovel tests placed in Area C, (ST1, ST2, and ST3) encountered bedrock at 20, 16, and 25cm
respectively and these were placed in areas away from outcrops where soils appeared deep. The test
(ST4) placed in Area B struck bedrock at 20cm. No testing was done in the 12 acre portion of Area A
because of the steep grade and lack of soil cover. The surface in this area was covered by cobbles and
outcrops of conglomerate. Soil profiles of the shovel tests are shown in the Appendix.
A number of small, irregularly-shaped clearings in the cedar woods 20 to 30 meters wide are scattered
across Area C and are visible in the aerials of Figures 2 and 3. On the ground, these clearings were seen
to contain push piles of dirt and burned cedar wood from previous brush clearing projects.
Summary and Recommendations
The field survey for this project covered areas that had not been previously surveyed by the LCRA’s
Archeology Services. No archeological sites were found in these areas. Previous surveys for other LCRA
projects in Area A recorded two sites, 41BT160 and 41BT161, both of which were assessed as ineligible
for SAL status by the LCRA and THC. Since no other sites are present in the project area, the clearing
should be allowed to proceed without further archeological investigation.
As always, standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable to this project. Should the work crew
uncover any presently unknown buried archeological features during the clearing work, then work should
cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archeology Services staff should be notified at
1-800-776-5272, ext. 6714 so that the find can be assessed in consultation with the THC. In such a
situation, work can continue in other areas where no archeological materials are present.

Introduction and Management Summary
In 2007, LCRA Archaeology Services submitted a report to the Texas Historical Commission entitled
Intensive Cultural resources Survey of LCRA’s Proposed Gloster Bend Resource Area Redevelopment
Project: Investigations in the Primary and Initial Development Area, Travis County Texas, that
described an approximate 170-acre development area within LCRA’s Gloster Bend Resource Area
proposed for overnight camping, day use areas, cabins and pavilions and other amenities. This report
described 14 archaeological sites identified within the development area, nine of which, 41TV1672, 1673,
1674, 1967, 2271, 2272, 2272, 2274 and 2278, were considered to be potentially eligible for formal
listing as State Archaeological Landmarks (SALs). The report delineated where development could take
place without archaeological constraints, and where any potential development would require possible
additional investigations (Malof and Prikryl 2008:203). The THC concurred with all recommendations
within the report.
In 2008, LCRA Archaeology Services submitted a second report entitled Intensive Cultural Resources
Survey of LCRA’s Proposed Revision of the Gloster Bend Redevelopment Project, Travis County, Texas,
that described investigations within an additional 38-acre section of the park that was proposed for an RV
camping loop (Malof 2009:282). One previously unrecorded site, 41TV2305, was recorded as a diffuse
lithic scatter and was considered ineligible for formal SAL listing. The THC concurred that development
could proceed within this area without any archaeological constraints.
These combined projects described approximately one-third of the the total park. A proposed series of
trails were not well-defined enough during those projects to allow meaningful survey or
recommendations.
During the interim period, it was determined that Gloster Bend is not presently suitable for the type of
development originally proposed. It is now being designated as a day-use park, with minimal
improvements planned. However, there is now a designated trail system that connects previously
reported upon areas with areas that have not been systematically reviewed (Figure 142). This project
describes the trail system through these new areas. At this time all avoidance areas in the previously
surveyed section will be maintained.
The investigated portion of the trail is about 3 miles of a total approximate 5-mile long trail. It will be
constructed primarily by following a “path of least resistance” with minimal clearing required, although
in some areas trees will be uprooted and a skidsteer-sized piece of equipment mounted with a bulldozer
type blade will be used to establish the trail tread. The trail will be 10 ft wide at most, so the project area
in the previously unsurveyed portion of the park will be about 3.6 acres.
The trail will pass within or very near to previously recorded archaeological sites 41TV476, 41TV477,
41TV482, 41TV484, 41TV483, 41TV2267, 41TV2268, and 41TV2269 (Figure 143). The entirety of this
portion of the trail was walked by a team of archaeologists in order to determine where visible
archaeological materials were present, make recommendations for avoiding such areas, and to evaluate
the potential for the trail impacting previously unrecorded sites.
The entirety of the present project area is within an upland setting with little to no soil deposition. Much
of it follows existing ranch roads or game tracks where visibility is fair to excellent. No shovel tests were
excavated. No new cultural resource sites were recorded as a result of this project.
Because the report on the 2007 project contains a lengthy background section including results of an oral
history with a local resident, that information will only be briefly summarized here. No artifacts were
collected during this project, and no curation will be necessary.

Study Area
The project area is within Glen Rose formation limestone and a transitional zone between the lowland
floodplain of the Colorado River and the uplands to the north. The point of land that comprises Gloster
Bend is incised by a number of drainages, indicating groundwater was once more plentiful then at present.
Soils consist of the Pedernales (Alfisol) and Altoga (Inceptisol) series, both of which indicate relatively
high moisture availability during soil formation. At present there are thirty-one recorded archaeological
sites at Gloster Bend, both historic and prehistoric. Prehistoric sites include river-side camps, upland
camps, lithic scatters, and lithic procurement areas. Some of the upland campsites are distinctive in that
there appears to have been fairly intensive occupation at locations removed from immediate water
sources.
Historically, the land was used for farming and ranching activities by members of the extended Singleton
family. Past clearing activities have resulted in a areas of a dense monoculture of juniper of uniform size.
The nearby Singleton Cemetery (previously Post Oak Cemetery) has numerous burials dating to the
1870s, and some as early as the 1850s. A number of house sites have been recorded, most of which
correspond to locations seen on turn-of-the-century topographic maps, and on which additional
information was gathered from local long-time resident Mr. Vernon Hollingsworth.

Research Design and Field Methods
It was known the trail was proposed to pass through or near several archeological sites that have been
recorded at various times. The trail is also routed through a portion of the property (primarily the
northwestern portion) that has not been intensively surveyed. Due to the limited nature of proposed
impacts, the trail was walked to determine where possible previously unrecorded sites might be located
and to assess the impact through known sites. The main concern is for secondary impacts caused by
hikers who might recognize artifacts on the ground and then begin collecting a site.
The flagged trail route was walked by a team of archaeologists equipped with GPS equipment into which
site boundaries had been loaded. When sites were approached extra care was taken to look for visible
artifacts, and when they were seen were noted on topographic maps and/or point plotted with the GPS.
These locations were communicated to the project manager with the understanding that the trail will be
routed around these areas.
Due to the upland nature of the project area, no shovel tests were excavated.
Results of Investigation
The nine sites that are within the area of potential effect are discussed below, beginning with 41TV484 in
the western portion of the project area then moving counterclockwise through the project area, discussing
each site in turn.
41TV484
This site was first recorded by Prewitt and Associates (PAI) in 1979 prior to brush clearing work. It was
described as a lithic resource area with large numbers of Pleistocene gravels that exhibited various stages
of lithic reduction, although tested cobbles and large flakes were most common. The site was considered
to be well-preserved and warranting additional, unspecified investigations.
LCRA inventory work over the past several years has demonstrated that while the site is primarily a
procurement locale typical of those seen elsewhere (and therefore unlikely to be able to provide specific

281

sourcing information) it also has some diversity of cultural materials. On the north side of the main
drainage a Montell point was recovered in 2007 in an area that also had a thin medial section of a biface
and several thin interior flakes in loamy sands that graded to cobles. During a trip by the Llano Uplift
Archaeological Society (LUAS) to attempt to locate a reported well in the area, also in 2007, a cluster of
apparent burned rock was noted along a small tributary stream channel. This appears to be a surficial
undisturbed large hearth or oven, although no artifacts were noted near it. Historic homesite 41TV2270
has been recorded within the boundaries of 41TV484. This scatter of artifacts and a small foundation
outline ay date to around the civil war period.
The proposed trail winds through the very southern edge of the site for a distance of about 170 m.
Observed materials included numerous gravels and occasional tested cobbles and large flakes. A casual
hiker will not recognize any of these items as cultural, and a trained eye would have little interest in
pursuing these types of materials. The trail is therefore not expected to impact any potentially significant
portions of the site.
41TV2269
This site was recorded in 2007 during inventory level investigations within the park. It is described as an
open campsite containing scattered burned rocks, as many as four possible hearths, numerous flakes
(unburned), a sandstone metate fragment and possible mano. This site extends a pattern that seems fairly
unique to Gloster Bend, one of relatively substantial camps in upland settings.
The trail runs for about 130 m through the western portion of the site. Very little cultural material was
seen along the trail route, until at the very northern section, where a few scattered burned rocks and two
or three flakes were seen. Although this is a very minor expression, given the nature of the site it was
decided to reroute the trail a short distance to the west where no cultural material was seen.
41TV483
This site was first recorded during brush control projects in 1979. It was described as an open camp with
hearth-sized clusters of of burned limestone. A possible Martindale point was noted along with numerous
pieces of debitage and partially thinned bifaces. Recommendations were for avoidance and preservation.
The site was revisited in 2007 for inventory work by LCRA. The base of a Nolan point and a probable
Uvalde point were collected, and the site’s boundaries were extended southward and upslope from the
original narrow bench it had been recorded on. The combined projectiles reinforce the perception (seen
also at 41TV477) of Early to Middle Archaic use of these upland settings.
The trail in this area wraps around the northern portion of the site, following an old ranch road.
Alongside this road, near the western edge of the site, was seen an area containing dispersed burned rock
and a very few flakes. However, because the trail is using an existing road at this point, there is little
reason to reroute the trail. Instead, passive barriers will be used. In this case, brush or ,mulch will be
placed on any areas of artifact visibility to limit the potential of discovery by trail users.
41TV2268
This site was recorded during LCRA inventory work in 2007. It is described as a lithic scatter with
burned rock and possible groundstone on exposed benches near a drainage. The possibility for shallowly
buried materials was noted. Although the site probably does not maintain enough integrity to be eligible
for SAL listing, it was recommended for avoidance and limited testing.
The trail was routed directly through this small site through a series of natural openings in the woods.
The route was subsequently moved northward to avoid the site.

282

41TV482
This site was first recorded in 1979 as a farmstead and prehistoric camp. It is located along the edge of a
steep canyon that is headed by a spring (or seep) fed plunge pool. This was the one site for which local
informant Vernon Hollingsworth had no information. The historic component consists of rock walls and
possible chimney fall, as well as a rock-lined path leading down to the pool. Artifacts include cut nails,
and glass and ceramic consistent with late 19th century occupations. The prehistoric component included
scattered burned rock, projectile points, flakes and cores. The projectiles included possible Plainview or
Golondrina, Angostura or Uvalde, two Montells, and an arrow point. The site was recommended for
avoidance and preservation. The site was revisited in 1997 and received additional mapping. No definite
house location could be found at that time.
The trail is routed through about 300 m of this site. Along the eastern edge it follows an existing dirt
road. One or two flakes and an occasional historic artifact were noted. As the trail enters the wooded
portion of the sites it goes west to the scenic edge of the canyon then follows the canyon edge southward.
The trail did not cross any readily visible artifacts. The main portion of the site is located north of where
the trail runs, closer to the fresh water source. The trail as it is presently routed is not considered to
impact the site.
41TV2267
This site was recorded in 2007 during inventory work. It is a lithic scatter with groundstone and a few
small hearths in a highly eroded setting. Recommendations were for avoidance.
The trail skirts the site to the north, staying within an existing dirt road. There is no incentive for trail
users to leave the trail at this point, so it is not felt necessary to make any further recommendations.
41TV486
This site was recorded in 1979 by PAI during brush control work. It was described as a light lithic scatter
with a few partially thinned bifaces. It was recommended for avoidance and limited testing. The site was
revisited in 2007 and was transected by a team of four archaeologists. Very little cultural material was
seen, although one possible hearth was noted in an eroded drainage.
The trail is routed along an existing dirt road in this area. The edges of the road have been bladed during
routine maintenance, and there are no visible clusters of artifacts. Careful examination of the exposed
surfaces reveals very few scattered flakes. It is not felt that any additional recommendations are
necessary for this area.
41TV476
This site was originally recorded as an historic dump and prehistoric burned rock and lithic scatter. Later
investigations in 2005 and 2007 combined with oral history interviews confirmed this was actually a
homesite with at least two periods of historic occupation. The site was substantially enlarged to
accommodate the newly found chimney fall and foundation remains. There are some substantial artifacts
scatters that are indeed dumps, but are now more clearly associated with specific people and events. The
prehistoric materials seem more ephemeral, and consist of occasional lithic scatters, some scattered
burned rock and a few pieces of groundstone seen towards the north end of the site.
The trail is routed through the southern portion of this site. There are four areas of concern here, each a
discrete scatter of historic and/or prehistoric materials. One consists of a light ceramic and glass scatter
with milk glass, aqua and purple glass and whiteware and a cut nail fragment as well as a few flakes. The
trail also crosses what appears to be a set of foundation stones (but may be the bladed corridor of an old
road) that may the remains of an outbuilding or an earlier, reported house site. Near the site center there
is a discrete dump of mostly metal artifacts and a bit further east one that is mostly glass. The trail was

283

rerouted around each of these areas. At the far eastern edge of the site is a small but discrete cluster of
flakes. It is at a point where the trail exist the woods and joins an existing ranch road. These flakes do
not lead to other artifacts, however they will be screened with brush, mulch or similar material.
41TV477
This site was recorded in 1979 during brush control work. It was described as an extensive but light lithic
scatter with at least two possible burned rock features. Several thinned bifaces and broken projectile
points, including an Early Corner Notched variety, were noted. A return visit in 2007 found four thinned
bifaces that seemed to have characteristics of Early Archaic technology. A 1-m diameter hearth and an 8m diameter burned rock cluster were recorded. The site seems to reflect a fairly intensive upland use
area.
The trail skirts this site to the east where it runs along an existing ranch road. There are no readily visible
artifacts in this area, and therefore no recommendations for trail construction.
Summary and Recommendations
LCRA has proposed a revised series of developments for its Gloster Bend Park located in western Travis
County, Texas. Most of these improvements will take place in areas previously surveyed and cleared
through THC.
This report addresses construction of a hiking trail through the otherwise underdeveloped northern portion
of the property. Approximately three miles of a planned five-mile loop are in areas not previously cleared
through THC. The trail passes through or very near nine previously recorded archaeological sites that are
both historic and prehistoric.
The archaeological survey was designed to identify areas of these sites (or previously unknown sites)
where artifacts are visible and so would be subject to collection by trail users, as well as potentially
causing people to leave the trail in search of additional artifacts.
No previously unrecorded sites were recorded as a result of the survey.
Of the nine archaeological sites potentially impacted by trail construction or use, four (41TV476,
41TV483, 41TV2268, 41TV2269) were recommended to the project manager for slight routing changes,
and in one case, the use of passive visual and traffic barriers to discourage movement off the trail. These
changes were all agreed to. Table 1 summarizes the sites and recommendations.

the four sites discussed above and will spot monitor during construction to ensure rerouted sections are
maintained and that passive barriers are installed correctly.

Part 2. Negative Surveys less than 2 Acres in Size, Transmission Line Maintenance
Projects, and Projects Cleared through File Searches
This section contains the texts of the results of 45 cultural resource assessments that were cleared
internally through memos from LCRA Archaeology Services to project managers. Thirteen of these
projects included on-the-ground assessments. Four of these were transmission line maintenance projects
and resulted in to recording of new archaeological sites. The rest were less than 2 acres in size and no
archaeological sites were present.
Thirty-one of these projects involved file searches. The vast majority were for transmission line
maintenance projects and consisted of reviewing previously recorded sites and/or identifying high
probability areas where ground disturbance minimization was recommended. A minimal number of
others were in areas that had been previously investigated and either had no sites present or the sites had
been previously determined ineligible for SAL listing. One project consisted of monitoring a small utility
trench.
Additionally, transmission line maintenance projects 44.09, 45.09, 46.09 and 47.09, in Crane, Crockett,
Pecos, Terrell and Upton counties, which consisted of adding vibration dampeners, are all being
conducted by use of helicopters, ensuring the avoidance of the areas described for each of these projects.

Project 1.09 Prescribed burn at Plum Park
(Figure 144)

County(s):

Fayette

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

January 2009

LCRA proposes to conduct a prescribed burn on 15-20 acres at its Plum Park, located in Fayette County.
Plum Park was partially surveyed in 1999 by LCRA Archaeology Services staff. One disturbed
archaeological site, 41FY531, was recorded near the entrance at that time. The site consists of a scatter of
prehistoric chipped stone artifacts and historic ceramics, glass and metal apparently associated with an old
house site. The site was considered fully recorded, other than potential archival work, at the time. No
avoidance is necessary at this site. The project may proceed without additional coordination with AS,
with the understanding that there is no mechanical disturbance, other than disking of existing fire lanes,
planned.

Project 7.09 T-519 Maintenance
(Figure 146)

County(s):

Caldwell

Type of Investigation:

File search, Survey

Date of Investigation:

February 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed maintenance work on Transmission Line T-519, which is also
known as the Lockhart to Reedville line. This transmission line extends for a length of about 9 miles in
Caldwell County, Texas.
The file search showed that there are no previously recorded archaeological sites within the right-of-way
(ROW) corridor. The file search also indicated that no cultural resource survey had been conducted prior
to the original construction of the line due to the fact that the construction predated the enactment of the
State Antiquities Code. Review of topographic maps suggested that there are a number of locations
within the transmission line corridor that have high probabilities for unrecorded archaeological sites.
Therefore, a cultural resource field survey was undertaken of select areas along the transmission line
right-of-way (ROW) in early February 2009 by the LCRA Archaeology Services staff.
Field survey methods used during the project consisted of intensive pedestrian survey along with shovel
testing. During the pedestrian survey, bare and eroded patches of ground surface were inspected as were
the cutbanks of stream channels and gullies. In the areas where ground surface visibility was poor and in
areas where there was a high likelihood that buried cultural materials could be present, shovel tests were
excavated in addition to the surface inspection during the walkover survey. The shovel tests were
excavated in 20 cm increments with all fill being screened through ¼ inch wire mesh. A total of six
shovel tests were excavated.
As a result of the investigation, two new cultural resource sites were recorded and assessed (Figure 147).
Site 41CW147 is a prehistoric campsite that is located north and east of the Clear Fork of Plum Creek.
Within the transmission line corridor, the site extends from approximately 40 meters east of Structure
64/5 to about 120 meters west of Structure 64/5 (see map attachment). Due to the presence of thick
grasses, the portion of the site within the transmission line corridor was primarily defined by shovel
testing. Three positive shovel tests, ST #3-5 were excavated within the transmission line ROW. Each of
these shovel tests yielded small numbers of artifacts within the upper 20 cm of soil deposits. No
diagnostic artifacts or evidences of features were found. Based on the shovel testing results along with
the fact that this area was previously cultivated, the portion of the site within the transmission line
corridor is assessed as insignificant and, thus, not National Register or State Archaeological Landmark
eligible. Maintenance work within this portion of Site #1 may proceed without any restrictions or special
conditions.
During the field survey, Doug Dube of the LCRA also showed the field crew the route of a proposed
vehicular access road that will loop around the north end of a wooded area containing a wetland.
Investigation of the access road area showed that larger numbers of prehistoric artifacts including two
flint bifaces, moderate numbers of flint flakes, and numerous burned limestone rocks are present along
the portion of Dube’s originally proposed vehicular access road in the vicinity of a very large willow tree.
This tree is situated about 400 feet north of the transmission line corridor. Several historic period bricks
and glass fragments were also noted which suggested a former house may have once stood in the vicinity

292

of the willow tree. This area appears to be a northeastern extension of the prehistoric remains observed
earlier in the transmission line corridor at 41CW147. The higher density of cultural materials in the area
around the large willow tree and northward suggests that this area may be the main prehistoric campsite
area, and thus could potentially be the significant portion of 41CW147. Due to this fact, the preferred
vehicular access road was moved southward. Doug Dube stated that he would use the rerouted access
corridor unless the landowner objected to its usage. Should the landowner wish LCRA to use a corridor
that runs further northward through the potentially significant portion of 41CW147, than such area should
only be utilized during dry weather conditions so that no buried deposits would be adversely affected.
Additionally, Doug Dube showed the field crew the location of a concrete-lined low water crossing
previously used for vehicles to cross the Clear Fork of Plum Creek channel. This crossing will require
some repair work for use during the current project. The low water crossing is situated about 175 feet
south of the transmission line ROW. The crossing is within the southwest edge of the portion of
41CW147 that is assessed as not significant.
A second cultural resource site, 41CW148, was noted within the transmission line ROW along the barditch adjacent to the southeast edge Borchert Road. This site is located about 70 feet west of Structure
64/3 and about 200 feet east of the east edge of the wetland feature described in discussion of Site #1.
This site consists of a small scatter of late 19th to early 20th century artifacts including whiteware ceramic
sherd fragments, solarized (purple) glass fragments, and several rusted metal can fragments. A total about
12 artifacts were seen on the slopes of ditch. The materials appear to represent trash dump materials
rather than the former location of a house structure. This interpretation is reinforced by the fact that the
1911 San Marcos, Texas 15’ USGS does not depict any house structures in the immediate vicinity. Site
41CW148 is assessed as not significant, and thus is not National Register or State Archaeological
Landmark eligible.
In conclusion, a cultural resource survey of areas along portions of the T-519 transmission line corridor
having high probabilities for unrecorded cultural resource sites led to the recording and assessment of two
new cultural resource sites, 41CW147 and 41CW148. The portions of these sites within the transmission
line corridor are assessed as not significant. A potentially significant portion of 41CW147 was found,
however, during additional survey work with Doug Dube for a proposed vehicular access road that will
loop northward around a wooded area containing a wetland. An alternative preferred access road corridor
was then laid out for Dube’s use so that the significant area will be avoided. Importantly, too, the
potentially significant part of 41CW147 lies over 400 feet from the wetland area, so that notification to
the Corps of Engineers was determined to not be necessary for the maintenance project.

Project 8.09 Fence at the LCRA’s Pedernales River Nature Park
(Figure 148)

County(s):

Blanco

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

February 2009

The LCRA is planning to construct barriers at their new park in Johnson City in order to prevent park
visitors from driving their vehicles off-road. Two types of barriers will be used: a fence with pipe posts
connected by cables and, along one small stretch, a series of boulders laid on the ground surface. The
pipe fence construction will cause some below ground disturbance since pipes will be driven into the
ground at 10 foot intervals.
Starting at the entrance gate 360 feet east of Hwy 281, a barrier fence will be constructed along the right
side of the road (as one enters the park) for a distance of 120 feet. From that point and continuing for a
distance of 170 feet, a series of boulders will be placed along the same side of the road. This area is
marked with red flagging tape. Then construction of the pipe fence will resume and continue along the
right side of the main park road all the way to the low water crossing on Town Creek, a distance of
approximately 1600 feet. Another segment of fence will begin on the west side of the same road
immediately north of the creek and run north for 490 feet. A third segment of fence will start a short
distance upstream from the dam on Town Creek and run north for 420 feet along the east side of the road
on the east edge of the former RV parking area (Figure 149).
On February 13, 2009, LCRA’s Archeology Services staff conducted a cultural resource survey of those
portions of the project area where subsurface disturbances are expected to occur, mainly where the pipe
fence will be constructed. The entire lengths of all three proposed fence routes were walked over and
shovel tests were placed at approximately 50 meter intervals where soil depth permitted.
No artifacts other than modern trash were seen on the surface during the walk-over. Ground visibility
was generally good with sparse grass cover and frequent bedrock outcroppings. Only the proposed fence
segment running between the two dam areas appeared to have deep soils. Four shovel tests were placed
along this route. Bedrock was encountered between 29 and 53 cm below the surface except for one test
which was ended at 50 cm while still in silty loam. No artifacts were recovered from these tests. The soil
profiles in the walls of most of these tests showed that the upper soil zones have been removed and in one
case a layer of crushed limestone laid over.
To summarize, no archeological sites were found in the portion of the project area where ground
disturbances will take place. The upper soil layers for the most part have been disturbed or removed by
construction associated with previous development and any cultural deposits that might once have existed
are no longer detectible.
Because the project covers less than two acres and no cultural resources sites were recorded, a report does
not need to be sent to the THC for a 30-day review period. Instead, the barrier construction can proceed
by virtue of this memo. However, if construction crews should uncover unexpected archeological
features, they should cease operations at the location of the discovery and contact Archeological Services
so an evaluation can be made.

Project 10.09 T-216 maintenance and stream crossings
(Figure 150)
County(s):

Austin, Colorado, Fayette

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

March 2009

LCRA proposes to conduct maintenance activities on existing transmission line T-216 between the
Fayetteville substation and the Bellville South substation in Fayette, Austin and Colorado counties.
Maintenance activities will include vegetation management, repair, replacement or construction of gates,
and improvement or construction of stream crossings. Stream crossings will at times require placement of
fill within the stream bed, and may also result in cutting of stream banks.
This transmission line was surveyed between the Fayetteville substation and the Bellville Split by LCRA
Archaeology Services for a rebuild project in 2008. The portion between the Bellville South substation
and the Bellville Split was surveyed by Hicks and Company archaeologists in 2003.
There are 11 known sites within the transmission line ROW: 41FY546, 41FY552-555 in Fayette County
and 41AU83 and 41AU90-95 in Austin County. No sites are recorded in the Colorado County portion of
the line.
Of the 11 sites, only one, 41FY555 is considered to be potentially eligible for formal listing as a State
Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places within the ROW. This
site is a deeply buried prehistoric lithic scatter located on a low levee formation, possibly an old bank of
Cummins Creek, about 260 meters (850 ft) east of the point where the transmission line crosses Cummins
Creek. Recommendations were that no deep disturbances occur at this site.
One other site, 41FY546, consists of a scatter of farm implements associated with an old farmstead (not
recorded) that lies outside the ROW. This site is located about 200 m (660 ft) west of the New Bremen
substation. The nearest mapped stream, a small tributary of Cummins Creek, is another 200 m further
west.
The remainder of the sites, which were lithic and burned rock scatters and historic trash scatters were all
judged to be ineligible within the transmission line ROW. It was noted during the analysis of site
locations that prehistoric sites were located on average 132 m (430 ft) from streams, and an average of 9
meters (30 ft) in elevation above them. Site 41AU94, a lithic scatter determined to be ineligible within
the ROW, was the closest, at a distance of 61 m (200 ft), from the closest point to Sandy Creek.
As result of the previous survey and reporting, which was reviewed and approved by the Texas Historical
Commission, recommendations for maintenance and stream crossing enhancement remain the same as for
the transmission line rebuild project. These activities may proceed at all locations other than at 41FY555
without archaeological oversight. If 41FY555 cannot be avoided than additional investigations should be
considered.
Otherwise, maintenance crews may proceed with the understanding that if unexpected buried
archaeological materials are uncovered during maintenance activities then those activities should cease in
the area of the discovery until Archaeology Services is reached at ext 6714 and additional investigations
can be conducted.

(Figure 151)

County(s):

Caldwell, Hays

Type of Investigation:

File search, field survey

Date of Investigation:

February 2009

The LCRA’s Archeology Services staff has completed its investigation of the proposed maintenance
project on the T-220 Transmission Line that runs between the Reedville and San Marcos Substations. A
file search showed that this line has not been previously surveyed by archeologists. Therefore
Archeology Services staff conducted a field survey to locate unrecorded sites within the T-220 corridor
that might be significant enough to warrant avoidance during the upcoming maintenance activities. The
survey focused on two stream crossings thought to have a high potential for prehistoric sites. These are
the Blanco River and a small, unnamed creek running along the line between Hays and Caldwell counties.
The survey included the entire length of corridor between Highway 80 and the east bank of the Blanco
River, a small area on the west bank of the river, and both sides of the stream at the county line.
One site, 41HY466, was recorded during the February 23, 2009 survey (Figure 152). It is located 1500
feet east of the Blanco River (as measured along the corridor) and contains two distinct surface scatters of
prehistoric cultural material separated by approximately 150 feet. The western scatter lies on the edge of
an agricultural field adjacent to a driving range and contains moderate amounts of stone tools, chipping
debris, and burned rocks. The eastern scatter lies on the east edge of a thicket of small trees adjacent to
the southwest corner of the driving range and extends eastwards out into another part of the plowed filed.
This scatter contains much less material than the western scatter, mainly chipping debris and a few burned
rocks
Three shovel tests were placed at Site 1 to determine depth and density of the buried deposits. Two of
these tests failed to recover artifacts; a third, placed on the western edge of the eastern artifact scatter
recovered two pieces of chipping debris near the surface and a single piece of chipping debris at a depth
of 16 inches. The recovery indicates that the cultural deposits are shallow with a low artifact density.
Site 41HY466 can be interpreted as two short term camps occupied at unspecified times in prehistoric
period. The deposits are shallow and have been thoroughly disturbed by land clearing and years of
plowing. Since the features and associations between artifacts have been destroyed, the site is not
considered eligible for State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation. Therefore, 41HY466 does not
need to be avoided during the upcoming maintenance project. Elsewhere if any unexpected archeological
material is encountered, please cease operations at the find site and contact Archeological Services so an
evaluation can be made.

Project 13.09 T-217 transmission line maintenance
(Figure 153)

County(s):

Austin

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

March 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed maintenance work on Transmission Line T-217, which is also
known as the Bellville South to Peters line. This transmission line extends for a length of about 8.65
miles in Austin County, Texas.
The file search showed that the T-217 line was surveyed for cultural resource sites in 2003 by
archaeologists from Hicks & Company for LCRA’s proposed rebuild of T-217. No cultural resource sites
were found by the Hicks & Company staff. Based on the results of that investigation, the proposed T-217
rebuild was allowed to proceed without any further cultural resource investigations.
A review of the Hicks & Company project documentation for their work on T-217 indicates that the
pedestrian survey was intensive and that extensive shovel testing was undertaken by the Hicks and
Company staff. This work included coverage of all stream crossing areas. A review of the Texas
Historical Commission’s computerized Site Atlas shows that no new cultural resource sites have been
recorded by other archaeologists within or near the T-217 right-of-way since the time of the Hicks &
Company in 2003. Based on these facts, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff recommends that the
currently proposed T-217 maintenance project be allowed to proceed as currently planned.
As always, standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable. Should the personnel conducting the
work uncover any presently unknown buried archaeological materials during construction, then work
should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be
contacted.

Project 16.09 Dredging on LCRA property at Windermere Cove
(Figure 154)

County(s):

Travis

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

April 2009

The Windermere Oaks Property Owners Association would like to dredge a 1.6 acre area leased to them
by the LCRA on the east side of the Grelle Resource Area on Lake Travis. The area is currently used to
anchor a floating marina when the lake is at full pool. Dredging would allow the area to be used when
the lake is at lower levels. This particular spot has not been investigated by archeologists previously
although significant archeological sites are known to be in the immediate area. To make sure the
dredging does not impact any unrecorded archeological sites, LCRA’s Archeological Services conducted
a cultural resources survey of the project area on April 10, 2009.
The proposed dredging area appeared at the time of the survey to have been carved from the natural slope
leading down to the drainage that runs along the east side of the Grelle Resource Area. This has occurred
either from the use of earth-moving machinery or from years of erosion caused by wave action. In either
case, the natural soil cover has been removed from the landform, exposing the underlying talus material
or, nearer the tip of point, river gravels. A shovel test found 18” of loose sand over red clay at the south
end of the project area, the main area free of surface rocks. The sand appears to be recently deposited and
contained no cultural material other than one small piece of rusted metal. The surface of the entire leased
area was inspected and found to contain no artifacts other than recent trash.
Since the portion of the project on LCRA property covers less than two acres and contains no
archeological sites, a report does not need to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission for approval and
the dredging can proceed without further archeological investigation. However, if the work crews should
uncover any presently unknown archeological features, dredging should stop in the immediate area of
discovery and LCRA Archeology Services should be contacted.

(Figure 155)

County(s):

Washington

Type of Investigation:

File Search

Date of Investigation:

April 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to conduct
maintenance and clearing work on the T-105 transmission line which is also called the Salem to Highway
36 Transmission Line. This transmission extends for a total length of 19.56 miles, and it is situated in
Washington County, Texas.
A file search showed that this transmission line was surveyed for cultural resources in 2003 by the Hicks
& Company archaeological staff. The cultural resource survey was undertaken due to LCRA’s proposal
to upgrade the line by replacing wooden H-frame structures. Despite intensive field survey efforts along
the entire T-105 line, no cultural resource sites were found during that survey.
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s computerized Site Atlas shows that no new cultural
resource sites have been recorded within or near the T-105 corridor in the years following the Hicks &
Company survey. Based on the negative results of the previous survey work, the LCRA Archaeology
Services staff recommends that the proposed maintenance work be allowed to proceed as currently
planned. However, should the maintenance personnel uncover any presently unknown buried
archaeological materials during work, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and
LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted.

Project 22.09 Drilling a test well
(Figure 156)

County(s):

Burnet

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

June 2009

The LCRA plans to drill a test well in the Whitewater Springs Subdivision in Burnet County. Anticipated
impacts include the clearing of small trees and brush from an area of approximately 1600 ft 2 and drilling a
single hole less than 10” in diameter down into the underlying bedrock. If the well produces enough
water, a small diameter (less than 2”) pipeline will then connect the new well to an existing LCRA-owned
well located 400 feet to the south southwest. This pipeline will run underground through an existing
conservation easement that has previously been cleared of woody vegetation. The only anticipated impact
will be the excavation of a trench approximately 8” wide and 1 to 2 feet deep.
The project area has never been surveyed for cultural resources. Since the project is located in an area
judged to have a high potential for archeological sites due to its proximity to the confluence of two
streams, one apparently a spring-fed creek, LCRA’s Archeology Services staff conducted a field survey
on June 24, 20009 of areas where the impacts listed above will occur.
The proposed well site was located by GPS. Three iron rebars with yellow caps were found marking
three of the corners of the site. This area is covered by small cedar trees with very sparse ground
vegetation growing on the weathered limestone bedrock. An old dirt road running along the northeast
side of the proposed well site has cut down into the bedrock. No artifacts other than recent metal trash
were seen in the area. Because of the good ground visibility and the lack of soil, shovel testing was not
done. The conservation easement where the water pipeline will run was surveyed during the visit. The
same situation of good ground visibility and little soil cover was encountered. Again, no artifacts were
observed. No archeological sites appear to present in the project area.
Since the portion of the project on LCRA property covers less than two acres and contains no
archeological sites, a report does not need to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission for approval and
the project can proceed without further archeological investigation.

Date of Investigation:

June 2009

LCRA Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) is conducting standard ROW maintenance activities in
preparation for planned transmission line maintenance on the 28.5 mile-long transmission line T-271
between the Kunitz and Culberson substations in Culberson County, Texas (Figure 157). Activities will
include repairing existing roads and stream crossings and ensuring that each transmission line structure
can be approached by equipment for any necessary repairs, which could include replacement of individual
poles, cross arms, and hardware.

center. Shadow is from a wind turbine.

This line was surveyed for cultural resources by Espey Huston and Associates (now PBS&J) in 1995,
prior to its construction. Four of the sites they recorded (41CU544, 551, 552, and 557) within the present
ROW were recommended for partial avoidance. Subsequent to their survey, the line was partially

312

Figure 158. Project 13.09, T-217 maintenance, in Culberson County.

313

rerouted by moving angle STR 12 approximately 530 feet northward. The result was that about 5 miles
of the western end of the transmission line was not surveyed for cultural resources. Additionally, the
survey apparently assumed continuous travel down the ROW, and access routes were not considered.
During the week of June 22, 2009, LCRA Archaeology Services staff traveled to the project area in order
to flag areas at the four previously recorded sites requiring avoidance, and to survey high probability
areas along the previously unsurveyed line, and a single high probability area (a mapped spring) on the
eastern end of the line. Because this area of the state is not well known archaeologically, sites in all
settings can be considered potentially eligible for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks.
Upon arriving at each previously recorded site, areas recommended for avoidance were identified and
flagged. Flagging was accomplished in some cases by driving four foot long t-posts in the ground,
connecting them with 17 gauge wire, and then wrapping yellow caution tape around the posts and wire.
When there was insufficient soil depth or the avoidance area was minor, yellow caution tape was attached
to vegetation. In some cases additional avoidance areas within these sites were recognized and flagged as
well.
Additional survey was conducted at the vast majority of structures along roads at the western end. Stream
crossings were individually examined. Five previously unrecorded archeological sites were recorded,
three within the existing ROW, and two at stream crossing outside the ROW. Of these five sites, three are
recommended for avoidance and impact minimization.
The central part of the transmission line crosses the large Sibley Ranch. Access to this ranch had not been
granted at the time of survey. One site (41CU544) previously recorded by Espey Huston is on the
western edge of the property, and was visually examined from across the fence. Potential stream crossing
improvements could not be inspected on this property.
However, it soon became apparent that campsites in this area are associated with sometimes deep loamy
soils, probably of the Reeves-Reakor-Upton series (described briefly with Site 41CU750, below). These
are readily identifiable and separable from the shallow limestone, sandstone and gypsum bedrock seen
along the majority of the route. The construction supervisor accompanied the archaeologists during much
of the survey, and so was able to see these soils and become familiar with the archaeological concerns and
potential sensitive areas. Because all expected maintenance and improvements will be on existing roads,
impact minimization is considered an acceptable alternative to extensive site testing or complete
avoidance. Impact minimization is repeatedly referred to as “staying within the existing roadway as much
as possible, and that any necessary grading, widening or other improvements be kept to the absolute
minimum required for movement of equipment and supplies”.
In all cases where avoidance and/or impact minimization is recommended, future projects that include
significant ground disturbance (such as a rebuild) will need to consider additional archaeological
investigations to more fully assess these areas, and if necessary, ensure continued avoidance of sensitive
locations.
The nine sites are discussed below, and then followed by a summary of avoidance and impact minimization areas.
Locater maps are included (Figures 168-171)

New Sites
Site 41CU750
This site is a lithic scatter with burned rock located at and around the stream crossing between STRs 156
and 157, about .4 miles south of the Culberson substation (Figure 159). This area was investigated due to
the presence of a mapped spring, the head of which is about 60 m east of the centerline of the
transmission line. As mapped, this spring feeds a small drainage system that is quickly absorbed by soils
to the east. Vegetation in the area is typical scrub, with some scattered old growth cedar trees. Soils
range from very deep to very shallow over bedrock. Soils have not yet been specifically described for
area, but are generally described as Reeves-Reakor-Upton series, most likely Aridisols, and are derived
from both alluvial and aeolian processes. Observed soils were reddish-brown silty loams over limestone
bedrock. There appears to be little development of horizons. Observation in the creek banks showed no
evidence of any buried cultural material. Observed artifacts consisted of one chert flake and one or two
possible burned rocks within the ROW. Three or four burned rocks and one or two more flakes were
observed outside the ROW to the east. This site is considered to be fully investigated within and around
the ROW and is not considered potentially eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark
or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. No avoidance measures are necessary for this
or future projects.

Figure 159. Site 41CU750 setting. Springhead is in low drainage outside ROW to the right.

Site 41CU751
Site 41CU751 is an open camp located on the transmission line access road on the west side of Rock
House Draw/North Rock Draw just west of the Sibley Ranch property line. It is almost exactly onequarter mile south of STR 28. The site is within reddish-brown silty loams that begin 200 m (650 ft) west
of the creek channel. The site continues eastward for 150 m (500 ft) to the edge of the first stable terrace
above the creek. It probably has a substantial north/south distribution along the creek terrace. Observed
cultural materials consisted of scattered burned rock (mostly sandstone), and both chert and quartzite
flakes. One possible hearth was observed along the edge of the road. The site is almost certainly

315

contemporaneous with and could be considered a part of site 41CU554, located at the extreme western
edge of the Sibley Ranch. Site 41CU751 could not be fully investigated, and so is considered potentially
eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places. Recommendations for transmission line maintenance activities are to minimize impacts
by staying within the existing roadway as much as possible, and that any necessary grading, widening or
other improvements be kept to the absolute minimum required for movement of equipment and supplies.
Site 41CU752
Site 41CU752 is a small open camp/work station, about 20 m in diameter, which consisted of a hearth, a
steeply beveled uniface (Figure 162), and scattered flakes, mostly of quartzite (Figure 160). The site is
within scrub vegetation growing within reddish-brown silty loams. It is located .27 miles east of the
Kunitz substation, between STRs 3 and 4. The head of Rock House Draw is about 125 m to the
southeast. One small shovel test was placed next to the hearth feature. It was excavated to a depth of 20
cm and uncovered a single 15 cm piece of burned sandstone in the upper 10-15 cm (Figure 161). The
hearth was immediately next to the existing roadway, and was staked and flagged for avoidance. The
small size of this site suggests a residential or processing outlier of a larger site that may be closer to the
head to the head of the draw. Site 41CU753 is about 900 m to the east, and a complex of sites in this
setting is entirely feasible. Site 41CU752 could not be fully investigated, and so is considered potentially
eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark or nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places. Recommendations are for impact minimization by staying within the existing roadway as
much as possible, and that any necessary grading, widening or other improvements be kept to the absolute
minimum required for movement of equipment and supplies.

Figure 162. Quartzite uniface at Site 41CU752.

Site 41CU753
Site 41CU753 is an open camp located about 900 m (0.5 miles) east of Site 41CU752 (Figure 163). It is
in a very favorable location on a high bench overlooking the confluence of a set of tributaries to Rock
House Draw. The majority of the site appears to be located just outside the ROW to the south,
immediately beyond the reach of the STR 7 guy wires. Observed was a scatter of burned rock
representing a slightly disrupted hearth, a very thin quartzite uniface (Figure 164) that most likely served
as a knife (rather than a scraper) and scattered flakes, mostly of quartzite. Little was seen within the
actual ROW other than a single quartzite flake. Recommendations for this site are to stay within the
existing road. Although it does not appear that road improvements will be necessary at this location, any
dirt work should be kept to the absolute minimum required for movement of equipment and supplies.
Additional structure maintenance/repair may proceed, as long as the area to the south is not impacted.
This area was not flagged due to its location outside of the ROW. Avoidance can be achieved by
restricting vehicular traffic to the existing outside radius formed by the guy wires. Because this site could
not be fully investigated, it is considered potentially eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological
Landmark or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Future, more intensive projects
(such as a transmission line rebuild) should consider additional investigations at this location.

Site 41CU754
Site 41CU754 is located at STR 10 and eastward for a distance of 160 m, where it surrounds the canyon
head of a short tributary to Rock House Draw (Figure 165).. The presence of a substantial tree near the
canyon head indicates at least occasional of groundwater. Soils are a reddish-brown
reddish brown silty loam. The site
consists of a few pieces of scattered quartzite flakes, a few scattered burned rocks, and a tested cobble
near the stream channel. The area around the structure is the most likely spot for habitation, as the slope
to the creek would be prohibitive. Within the ROW this area appears highly deflated and eroded.
Research potential is considered to be low, and no avoidance measures are necessary.

Previously Recorded Sites
Four sites (41CU544, 551, 552 and 557), previously recorded in 1995 by Espey Huston (PBS&J) and
recommended for avoidance were revisited (indirectly in the case of 41CU544). No attempts were made
to reassess the sites as to potential eligibility. The construction supervisor was able to see all four of these
sites, and specific avoidance measures for each were discussed with him.
41CU544
Site 41CU544 is located on the east bank of Rock House Draw, just west of STR 29, and as mentioned
above is probably associated with Site 41CU751. Previous recommendations were to fence the edge of
the ROW and restrict vehicular traffic to the ROW. The sketch map drawn at the time does not show a
road that now parallels the creek and runs through the long north/south axis of the site. Permission had
not been obtained to cross the fence on to the Sibley Ranch at the time of survey, but the road and site
were clearly visible immediately across the fence, and the site extended somewhat across the fence line.
Because this is an existing road it is recommended its use be continued, provided that impacts are
minimized staying within the existing roadway as much as possible, and that any necessary grading,
widening or other improvements be kept to the absolute minimum required for movement of equipment
and supplies.
41CU551
Site 41CU551 is located around and contains STR 81 (Figure 166). Four distinct burned rock features
were originally recorded in 1995, including a small burned rock midden. Three small rock shelters were
also recorded along the south edge of the ROW on the edge of a rock outcrop. Recommendations were
that these areas all be flagged. Upon revisiting the site, the primary midden and hearth area was relocated
and flagged for avoidance. Another zone of burned rock that was relatively intact was seen just to the
west of these features, and likewise flagged. The three shelters were exceedingly small, and at most

319

would have sheltered a single person lying prone for a short period of time. These all appeared to have
been washed out, and perhaps partially collapsed since first recording. Nonetheless, they were also
flagged to ensure avoidance by heavy equipment. The avoidance areas still allow movement to and
around STR 81.

Figure 166. Structure 81 with two avoidance areas flagged. Additional avoidance behind structure to left at base of
rocky outcrop.

41CU552
Site 41CU552 was a lithic procurement site mapped just west of STR 79. It was considered to be
potentially significant due a mixture of local quartzite and “non-local” cherts, hypothesized to be present
in gravels within the adjacent Chico Draw streambed, but potentially representing imported materials,
thus providing an opportunity to interpret regional movement of prehistoric peoples. Unfortunately, no
sketch map was provided for this site, and the single point plot did not aid in relocation. The area
between STRs 78 and 79 was walked, and a few pieces of debitage were noted, but not in quantities or
varieties that allowed meaningful areas to identified or flagged. One possible hearth was seen eroding
from the hillside, and this was flagged for avoidance. Recommendations for this site are to travel along
the existing ROW road. Any necessary grading, widening or other improvements be kept to the absolute
minimum required for movement of equipment and supplies.
41CU557
Site 41CU557 is located on the east terrace of Wild Horse Draw immediately below (west of) the knoll
that holds STR 86 (Figure 167). Four burned rock features had been recommended for avoidance. These
could not all be clearly re-identified, probably due to recent vegetation growth. Previous orange fencing
was seen, and a large area was flagged for avoidance. The small stem of a chert dart point was seen near
these features. Another area of burned rock was seen within the present access road. This area was
likewise staked for avoidance. Recommendations are for any necessary grading, widening or other
improvements be kept to the absolute minimum required for movement of equipment and supplies.

320

Figure 167. View from STR 86 looking west at Wild Horse Draw. Yellow flagging is visible at two avoidance
areas.

Other Areas
Rock House Creek
The Rock House Creek crossing, immediately east of the rock house has the same reddish-brown silty
loams seen at other locations where potentially significant sites are located. The terrace between the
house and the creek were examined. Some possible burned rock feature was noted, but no flakes were
seen. As in other areas where this soil is present, recommendations are for any necessary grading,
widening or other improvements be kept to the absolute minimum required for movement of equipment
and supplies.

Kunitz Substation end
Overlapping with the locations of Sites 41CU752 and 41CU753 are areas of reddish brown silty loams.
These begin at or very near the Kunitz substation and continue eastward to between STRs 4 and 5, then
pick up again on the bench that contains Site 41CU753 and STR 7. Recommendations are for any
necessary grading, widening or other improvements be kept to the absolute minimum required for
movement of equipment and supplies.
Sibley Ranch
Access to the Sibley ranch property was not granted during the time of survey. According to the
construction supervisor, there will be some stream crossings and possibly other areas outside the ROW

321

that will require earth movement. Following field visits and discussions with him, he is clearly aware of
the types of soils (reddish brown silty loams) that are correlating with site locations. It is recommended
that if any of these soils are encountered, then any necessary grading, widening or other improvements be
kept to the absolute minimum required for movement of equipment and supplies.

Summary of Recommendations
There are nine recorded archaeological sites that have areas requiring avoidance. Two other specific
locations may contain sites. The Sibley Ranch remains unknown in areas outside the ROW. In general,
soils are a determining factor in avoidance. These have been identified in the field with the construction
supervisor and are readily identifiable as reddish brown silty loams with little to no naturally occurring
surface rock. Whenever these soils are encountered, existing roads should be used and any necessary
grading, widening or other improvements be kept to the absolute minimum required for movement of
equipment and supplies.
Specific recommendations are summarized below, beginning at the Kunitz substation and proceeding
eastwards towards the Culberson substation.
1.
From the Kunitz substation eastward for a distance of 2,000 feet: Stay on existing road, minimize
any ground disturbance, avoid the flagged feature (Site 41CU752) between STRs 3 and 4.
2.
At STR 7, limit vehicular movement on the south side of the structure to the outside
circumference defined by the existing guy wires. Minimize overall ground disturbance.
3.
Either side of STR 7: For a distance of 200 feet to the east and 500 feet to the west, stay in the
existing road and minimize ground disturbance.
4.
Rock House Creek crossing at Rock House: Minimize impacts along existing road beginning at a
point about 250 feet east of the house and continuing for about 200 feet to the creek.
5.
West terrace of Rock House Draw/North Rock Draw due south of STR 28: Minimize impacts in
existing road beginning at creek edge and continuing westward for a distance of about 500 feet.
6.
Structure 29 (Sibley Ranch): Minimize all impacts, stay on existing roads beginning at a point
about 100 feet west of the structure and continuing southward to the active stream channel.
7.
Sibley Ranch: Minimize impacts on existing roads when reddish-brown silty loams are
encountered outside the ROW.
8.
STR 79 (41CU552): Stay on existing road for a distance of 500 feet to the west. Avoid the
feature flagged about 220 feet west of the structure
9.

STR 81 (41CU551): Avoid flagged areas in vicinity of structure.

10.
STR 87 (41CU557): Avoid flagged areas located on terrace about 250 feet west of (and below)
structure. Minimize any additional impacts in this area.

Project 25.09 T-121 transmission line maintenance
(Figure 172)
County(s):
Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

July 2009

LCRA Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) proposes to conduct standard maintenance on
transmission line T-121 between the Raymond F. Barker and the Comfort substations in Kerr and Kendall
counties, Texas. Work will consist of mowing, shredding, gate and fence replacement, and repairs to
transmission line structures as necessary along the existing ROW.
This transmission line was surveyed by LCRA Archaeology Services staff for cultural resources prior to a
rebuild project in 2005. Three potentially eligible archaeological (41KR517, 41KR519 and 41KE166)
sites were documented that required some level of avoidance or impact minimization. These same sites
still require impact minimization.
At 41KR517, an historic Otomi Indian dugout, movement of equipment should be limited to the existing
ROW for a distance of 150 ft on either side of STR 5/7
At 41KR519, a buried lithic scatter and probable open camp, the area between STR 4/1 and Wilson Creek
should not have root removal of large woody vegetation, especially along the west bank of Wilson Creek
which is about 600 ft northeast of STR 4/1.
At 41KE166, deep ground disturbance should be avoided for a distance of 100 ft around STR 2/6.
If these measures cannot be followed then Archaeology Services staff should be contacted.

at the South Shore Park on Lake Bastrop
(Figure 173)
County(s):

Bastrop

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

September 2009

On September 25, 2009, LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted a field survey of proposed
construction sites in parts of the LCRA’s South Shore Park designated as Area 1 and Area 2. In Area 1 at
the entrance to the park, a new regional operations facility and maintenance restroom will be built. A
buried wastewater pipeline approximately 180 feet long will connect the two buildings. The road that
loops around the existing park entrance building will be realigned outwards to accommodate the new
facility building. The total construction area covers less than one and a half acre.
In Area 2 west of the existing parking lot for the boat ramp, a new park host site will be constructed
consisting of a concrete slab for an RV and a buried wastewater pipeline connecting the park host site to
an existing septic tank 200 feet to the northeast. Short water and electrical lines will also be constructed
west and north, respectively.
The survey consisted of a walkover of the proposed construction sites of Area 1 and Area 2 to search for
surface artifacts and cultural features. In addition, shovel testing for buried cultural material was done in
areas where ground visibility was poor. Each shovel test involved digging a hole 35cm in diameter in
20cm-thick levels and screening the fill through a 1/4 inch wire mesh. The holes were dug to depths of
between 42 and 85cm, depending on the thickness of surface soil zone.
Area 1
A file search had shown that Area 1 overlaps the northern edge of a previously recorded archeological
site, 41BP354. This site contains the remains of World War II era earthworks and inert ordinance used in
military training at Camp Swift. During the survey for this project, a metal detector was used to search
for any buried mines and shells that might be present in the project area.
The only metal objects detected were two short lengths of bailing wire. These were found along the path
of the proposed wastewater pipeline. No metal was detected in the areas were the road will be realigned.
The metal detector was not used at the proposed operational facility site because of the relatively large
amounts of recent metal thought to be left over from previous construction. North of the loop
immediately outside the proposed alignment area, a wide shallow depression was found. No metal was
detected near the feature and in all probability it is recent, perhaps formed by tree fall.
The only possible archeological materials found on the surface in Area 1 were several flint flake
fragments mixed in with gravels on the south edge of the pavement of the south loop road. These flakes
do not appear to be of prehistoric origin.
One shovel test was placed 14 meters north of the existing entrance building within the site area of the
proposed operations facility. No artifacts other than a fragment of recent glass were recovered. The soil
profiled in the wall of the test showed several distinct soil layers of clay and gravels near the surface over
deeper sands. These layers were probably produced by recent construction activities and indicate that the
ground has been disturbed in this portion of Area 1. A second test was placed well away from the road

329

along the path of the proposed wastewater line in an area that appears to have intact soil. The test
encountered sand from the surface down to depth of 80cm where fragmented sandstone was struck. This
probably represents a more typical soil profile for the area. No artifacts were recovered from this test.
Area 2
No artifacts were seen on the surface at the proposed construction sites in Area 2. As with Area 1, gravels
were present along the road edges but also in a few scattered patches away from the pavement. A shovel
test placed at the proposed park host site recovered no artifacts. The test was dug through fine sand to a
depth 22cm where red clay was encountered. Even though this area lies well north of the current
boundaries of 41BP354, the metal detector was used to rule out the presence of material associated with
Camp Swift. No metal was detected in the proposed park host area. Another test was placed north of the
boat ramp parking area where the wastewater pipeline for the park host site will run. This test was dug to
a depth of 42cm through wet silt and sand and recovered no artifacts.
To summarize, no archeological sites were found within the proposed project areas at South Shore Park.
Although the previously recorded site 41BP354 is plotted as overlapping the southern portion of Area 1,
this survey suggests that its northern limits lie some undermined distance to the south outside the project
area. Since the total area of the project covers less than two acres and contains no archeological sites, a
report does not need to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission for approval and the project can
proceed without further archeological investigation.

Project 28.09 Dredging on LCRA property at Paradise Point on Lake Buchanan
(Figure 174)
County(s):

Llano

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

August 2009

A private landowner wishes to dredge out rock and sediments in front of his property on the east side of
Maxwells Slough on Lake Buchanan in Llano County (Figure 1). The dredging will take place below the
full pool level of the lake (1020 feet amsl) on exposed lake bottom that is owned by the LCRA. The
dredging will extend from the full pool shoreline out 150 feet and cover an area of approximately 0.17
acre. A file search showed that the area had not been previously surveyed for cultural resources. It also
showed that an early saltworks dating back to the 1850s once operated nearby. Because of the potential
for Historic as well as prehistoric sites, LCRA’s Archeology Services staff conducted a cultural resources
survey in the proposed dredging area.
The survey was done on July 31, 2009. On arriving at the project site, it was immediately apparent that
the slope leading from the full pool elevation down to the current water level at 997 feet amsl had been
previously carved out down into bedrock by heavy machinery. A thick bed of sand has since been
deposited on the floor of the cut. A shovel probe into the sand approximately 100 feet out from the full
pool shoreline encountered the bedrock floor at a depth of 18 inches. No intact soil is present within the
proposed dredging area and whatever cultural material that may have existed there was removed when the
slope and underlying bedrock was excavated, presumably done to allow access for boats. No
archeological sites are present in the project area.
Since the portion of the project on LCRA property covers less than two acres and contains no
archeological sites, a report does not need to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission for approval and
the dredging can proceed without further archeological investigation. However, if the work crews should
uncover any presently unknown archeological features, dredging should stop in the immediate area of
discovery and LCRA Archeology Services should be contacted.

(Figure 175)
County(s):

Blanco

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

October 2009

The LCRA is planning to install a buried water pipeline in their Pedernales River Nature Park in Blanco
County. The pipeline will tie into an existing line outside the park’s northwest property line and will run
eastwards through the park to the existing pavilion for a distance of approximately 240 feet. Since a
trench will have to be dug for the pipeline, any buried archeological deposits in its path could be
impacted. Therefore LCRA’s Archeology Services staff conducted a survey along its route to identify
any archeological sites and assess their potential for State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation.
The survey was conducted on October 7, 2009 and involved inspecting the ground surface where the
trench will be dug and placing shovel tests in areas where there appeared to be deep, undisturbed soil.
Each shovel test consisted of digging a circular hole 35 cm in diameter and screening the fill through a ¼”
wire mesh to recover any artifacts. The area immediately west of the pavilion where the eastern half of
the pipeline will run was found to have frequent exposures of limestone bedrocks. Shovel probes in areas
with soil cover struck bedrock a few inches below the surface and therefore could not harbor cultural
deposits of much substance. In any case, no cultural material was seen on the surface other than modern
trash and construction material..
Midway between the pavilion and the Park’s western property line lie the remains of a cattle working
station with metal fences and a shed. This station is modern and was probably in use in the 1960s or
1970s. Between the station and the western property fence the soils appear deep with no obvious signs of
disturbances. Three shovel tests were placed in this area reaching depths of between 39 and 97 cm. No
artifacts were recovered. No prehistoric artifacts were seen on the surface in this area.
To summarize, no archeological sites were found during the survey. Because the project covers less than
two acres and no cultural resources sites were recorded, a report does not need to be sent to the THC for a
30-day review period. Instead, the project can proceed by virtue of this memo. However, if construction
crews should uncover unexpected archeological features, they should cease operations at the location of
the discovery and contact Archeological Services so an evaluation can be made.

The LCRA plans to construct a new road on the north end of the downstream side of Buchanan Dam.
The road will provide access to the 16 Gate Section for part of a floodgate modification project. The
proposed road will run from Hwy 690 near the entrance to Big Chief Resort to the transmission line ROW
behind the 16 Gate Section, a total distance of a little over 1600 feet. The construction width of the road
is 30 feet making the area of impacts cover 1.1 acre. Previous cultural resources surveys by LCRA’s
Archeology Services of the downstream side of the dam have demonstrated a relatively high density of
prehistoric sites in that area. Since the area where the proposed road will be constructed has not been
surveyed for cultural resources, there appeared a high likelihood that unrecorded archeological sites
would be present in the project area. Therefore, LCRA’s Archeology Services staff conducted an
intensive archeology survey along the route of the proposed road.
The survey took place on August 13, 2009. The methodology consisted of walking the entire path of the
proposed road route in two transects approximately 15 feet apart. Shovel tests were dug in areas with
poor surface visibility or in high potential areas for archeological sites along drainages. Each test
involved digging a hole 14 inches in diameter down to bedrock or to a subsoil zone and screening the fill
through a ¼ inch mesh to recover artifacts. A total of six tests were dug, complying with the THC’s
minimum requirement for a linear project of this length. No artifacts or archeological features were seen
within the project area and no artifacts were recovered from any of the shovel tests. Therefore, no
archeological sites are present in the project area.
Since the project area covers less than two acres and contains no archeological sites, a report does not
need to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission for approval. Road construction can proceed
immediately without further archeological investigation. However, if the work crews should uncover any
presently unknown archeological features, then the work should stop in the immediate area of discovery
and LCRA Archeology Services should be contacted.

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed FY10 upgrade work on Transmission Line T-165, which is also
known as the Winchester to Fayetteville line. The proposed upgrade work will consist of the replacement
of 153 knee braces, 21 steel cross arms, 48 transmission poles, and 114 insulators.
A file search showed that the T-165 line was surveyed for cultural resource sites in 2003 by the LCRA
Archaeology Services staff due to planned maintenance work on the line. Four cultural resource sites,
41FY213, 41FY515, 41FY543, and 41FY545 were recorded and assessed during that investigation. The
portions of all four of these archaeological sites within the transmission line corridor were assessed as
insignificant, and the maintenance work was allowed to proceed without any special conditions or
restrictions.
For the currently proposed upgrade the Texas Historical Commission’s computerized Site Atlas was also
checked to determine if any additional cultural resource sites have been recorded within or near the
transmission line corridor by other archaeologists since the LCRA’s 2003 field survey. The Site Atlas
showed that there are no additional new sites for consideration. Based on these facts, the LCRA
Archaeology Services staff recommends that the currently proposed T-165 upgrade project be allowed to
proceed as currently planned.
As always, standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable. Should the personnel conducting the
work uncover any presently unknown buried archaeological materials during construction, then work
should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be
contacted.

The LCRA’s Transmission Services Corporation is planning routine maintenance on their T-219
transmission line between the Burnet and Lampasas Substations. A file search showed that the LCRA’s
Archeology Services staff surveyed the T-219 corridor in October of 2003 for a previous T-219
maintenance project. The survey concentrated on portions of the ROW near stream crossings, which have
a high potential for prehistoric sites. During the survey three new archeological sites were recorded,
41LM43, 41LM44, and 41BT360, and two previously recorded sites, 41BT96 and 41LM18, were
revisited.
Two of the new sites, 41LM43 and 41LM44, and the two previously recorded sites, 41BT96 and LM18,
were recommended for avoidance measures during the 2003 project. These avoidance measures are
described below and should be followed for the current maintenance project on T-219.
Site 41LM43 is a buried prehistoric camp located on the floodplain on the north side of Sulphur Creek.
Since the cultural deposits appear shallow, vehicles and heavy machinery should avoid the area between
STA 1052 and STA 1035+50 (north bank of Sulphur Creek) if the ground is excessively wet. In addition,
no bulldozing of vegetation should occur at all within this area.
Site 41LM44 is a prehistoric quarry site where a distinctive black flint was mined in prehistoric times. It
is located on the south cutbank of Sulphur Creek and extends northwards onto the bluff above. Between
STR 20/3 and STR 20/4, vehicles should stay on the existing corridor road. Between STR 20/4 and the
south bank of Sulphur Creek there should no vehicular traffic at all.
Site 41BT96 is a prehistoric camp containing a pristine burned rock midden within the transmission line
ROW. The site is located on the north side of South Mesquite Creek. Vehicles should stay on the
existing ROW road between the county road (STA 701+16) and STR14/2.
Site 41LM18 is the Live Oak Cemetery located on the northwest side of the town of Lampasas. The
transmission line ROW parallels the west fenceline of the cemetery and could contain unmarked burials.
Between STR 22/7 and the north end of the cemetery, vegetation should be cleared in ways that do not
disturb the soil. If the ground is excessively wet, heavy vehicles should avoid this area.
To summarize, four sites need to be avoided within the T-219 ROW during the upcoming maintenance
project. The areas of concern and specific avoidance measures are described above. Elsewhere if any
unexpected archeological material is encountered, please cease operations at the find site and contact
Archeological Services so an evaluation can be made.

The LCRA’s Transmission Services Corporation is planning routine maintenance on their T-486
transmission line between the Kerrville Legion and Raymond F. Barker Substations. A file search by
LCRA’s Archeology Services staff found that Espey, Huston, & Associates conducted a cultural
resources survey of the T-486 corridor (when it was part of the T-121 Transmission Line) in 1995 for an
LCRA pole replacement project. EH&A recorded nine new archeological sites in the corridor: 41KR503
and 41KR506 through 41KR513. In addition, a previously recorded lithic procurement site, 41KR207,
that extends into the corridor was revisited.
All but two of the sites recorded by ES&A consist of surface scatters of flint chipping debris and a few
stone tools. In addition to these sites, Site 41KR504 contains a surface scatter of early 20th century trash
and Site 41KR510 contains a light scatter of Historic trash, either late 19th or early 20th century, in
addition to a prehistoric lithic scatter. All these sites as well as 41KR207 contain cultural material that is
confined to the surface and presumably disturbed. The EH&A archeologists considered these sites
ineligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and therefore no avoidance
measures were recommended for these sites during the 1995 pole replacement project. This
recommendation applies to the upcoming maintenance project as well.
To summarize, the T-486 corridor was surveyed previously for cultural resources and ten archeological
sites have been recorded within it. None are considered eligible for NRHP listing or for State
Archeological Landmark designation and none of the sites needs to be avoided during the upcoming
maintenance project. Elsewhere if any unexpected archeological material is encountered, please cease
operations at the find site and contact Archeology Services so an evaluation can be made.

Introduction
LCRA proposes to conduct enhanced maintenance along transmission line T-158 between the Zorn and
Luling substations in Guadalupe and Caldwell Counties. Maintenance may include vegetation
management, fence and gate repair, support structure repair, improvements to stream crossings, and
possible other activities including structure replacement. The line runs southward from the Zorn
substation to the Seguin Split, and in this portion is parallel to or circuited with T-203. T-158 then turns
east and proceeds to the Luling substation. The portion from Zorn to the Seguin Spilt was surveyed in
2006 by LCRA Archaeology Services staff. Although six previously unrecorded sites were recorded at
that time, there were no recommendations other than minimizing soil disturbance between 70 m (230 ft)
south of STR 9 and 30 m (100 ft) north of STR 10. These structures correspond with the equivalent
structure number for T-158, and the recommendations remain the same. There are no other restrictions
between Zorn and the Seguin Split.
The Seguin Split to the Luling substation T-158 is approximately 18 miles in length. There is no record
that the line has been previously surveyed for cultural resources. Cultural resource investigations were
conducted by LCRA Archaeology Services staff on August 10 and 20, 2007. The investigations focused
on stream crossing with potential for alluvial terraces, knolls and other outlooks, and mapped Holocene
terraces. The level of investigation was largely commensurate with perceived project impacts. Six
previously unrecorded prehistoric sites were recorded, and the location of two graves mapped on the plan
and profile was visited. The project area crosses a broad, stream-dissected divide between the San
Marcos and Guadalupe rivers. Three of these sites appear to be prehistoric camps located near or
overlooking these streams. Two prehistoric camps are located near the San Marcos River, and the final
site is located on what appears to be a relict channel of the San Marcos River. The sites were temporarily
numbered Sites 1-6, (41GU102-105, 41CW109 and 41CW110) and are described below sequentially in
occurrence from west to east.

Survey Methods and Results
Sites 41GU102 and 41GU103 are located within about 120 meters of each other, but are considered
separate based on a stream bed division and discontinuity in cultural materials. Site 41GU102 is across a
relatively narrow interfluvial lobe. Beginning at the location of STR 6/4 gravels seen on the slopes to the
west give way to sandier soils. Within these soils are burned rock and flakes visible in bare and eroded
surfaces. A single medial section of a broad, thin biface was seen within the access road. Visibility is
generally quite poor in this area, with dense bitter weed covering most of the ground surface. Regardless,
visibility is sufficient to demonstrate that camping debris corresponds with the top of the lobe, and is no
longer present when gravels appear on the slopes to either side. At present there is insufficient
information to make a determination of State Archeological Landmark status. As no impacts beyond
mowing or shredding are expected, no additional work is felt to be needed at this time. Additional

345

impacts or future work from STR 6/4 eastwards for a distance of 500 ft will require additional cultural
resource investigations to be considered.
Site 41GU103 is located on a long west trending lobe fronting the drainage immediately east of Site
41GU102. Materials including burned rock, lithic debitage, and stone tools are more common, or at least
more visible at this site, especially within the highly eroded access road. There is very little surface
manifestation outside these eroded areas, indicating that much of the site is buried under fairly shallow
colluvial or in situ soils.
A semi-formal scraper and a probable Early Triangular form (perhaps 6,000 years old) projectile or knife
were seen at this site. Although there seems to be very little material present on the floodplain terrace of
the creek, a few small burned rocks were seen within the cutbank. The site is therefore considered to
extend all the way to the creek. At present there is insufficient information to make a determination of
State Archeological Landmark status. As no impacts beyond mowing or shredding are expected, no
additional work is felt to be needed at this time. Additional impacts or future work for a distance of 500 ft
on either side of STR 6/6 will require additional cultural resource investigations to be considered. The
existing stream crossing does not appear to need major modification, but if such activities become
necessary, Archaeology Services should be consulted.
Site 41GU104 is located across a broad Holocene-aged alluvial terrace along the south bank of Brushy
Creek and its junction with two north-running tributaries. It encompasses STRs 12/3, 12/4, and 12/5, and
continues past STR 12/5 for a distance of 300 feet to the east. Observed material included burned rock,
lithic debitage, and a few cores. A single shovel test was placed along the edge of the ROW. This test
was excavated to a depth of 80 cm (31 inches), and recovered two burned pebbles from the upper 20 cm,
and two burned chert fragments, (which may be cultural in origin) from between 40 and 60 cm. The soil
was a generally a brown sandy loam. Soil depth remains unknown, although examination of the nearby
creek bank and other observations indicate it may be five or more feet in thickness. Material is also
visible on either side of the tributary system feeding Brushy Creek. It is within and alongside a highly
eroded and washed out series of old roads, that are now impassable. This creek channel is highly variable
in composition, with some portions having a thin veneer of recent soil over very ancient (pre Holocene,
probably Eocene-aged) sandy clays, and others containing several feet of relatively recent soil
development. At present there is insufficient information to make a determination of State Archeological
Landmark status. Impacts should be limited to standard shredding, mowing, and removal of vegetation
without ground disturbance. Additionally, there should be no modification to the existing creek crossing.
Bulldozer activity in this area has the potential to destroy previously undisturbed cultural materials. As
the line can be accessed from either side without crossing the creek, it is Archaeology Services preference
that no crossing modifications or improvements be made. If this is not possible, than Archaeology
Services recommends that additional investigations be made, preferably in the presence of Transmission
Services staff, so that an agreed upon route through the site can be designed. More than likely, this
should be followed up by monitoring of construction. Such work will require modification to the existing
cultural resource portion of the T-158 budget. Any future work in this area will require additional
consultation with Archaeology Services.
Site 41GU105 begins at angle STR 16/5 and continues eastward for a distance of 250 feet past STR 16/6.
It is situated on the high lobe and series of benches overlooking the San Marcos River to the east. Burned
rock and flakes are common, and a possible arrow point preform and possible hammerstone were
observed. Materials are seen within exposures within and along dirt roads, and other eroded areas.
Cultural material is certainly present below the surrounding ground surface as well. At present there is
insufficient information to make a determination of State Archeological Landmark status. As no impacts
beyond mowing or shredding are expected, no additional work is felt to be needed at this time.

346

Additional impacts or future work from STR 16/5 to the west bank of the San Marcos River will require
additional consultation with Archaeology Services.
Site 41CW109 lies across the center of a broad knoll between STRs 16/9 and 16/10 that is located
between the San Marcos River and what is almost certainly an old channel of the river to the east. It is
primarily a prehistoric site with a light scatter of burned rock and flakes, although there is also a small
amount of historic material within the existing dirt road, including solarized glass (manufactured prior to
1918), semi-vitreous ceramics, and some pieces of metal. At present there is insufficient information to
make a determination of State Archeological Landmark status. As no impacts beyond mowing or
shredding are expected, no additional work is felt to be needed at this time. Additional impacts or future
work between STRs 16/9 and 16/10 will require additional cultural resource assessments.
Site 41GU110 is located on a small knoll immediately east of the proposed relict channel of the San
Marco River, and so it was once “riverfront property.” The known site extends from STR 17/4 eastward
for a distance of about 450 feet. As with the other five sites, it contains burned rock and lithic debitage,
the density of which is dependent upon ground surface visibility. A shovel test placed near STR 17/4 was
excavated through 50 cm of sandy clay loam. A piece of burned chert was recovered from about 30 cm in
depth. Although calcium carbonate threads increased with depth, it was not felt that a subsoil had been
reached. More of this site is certainly buried in the surrounding soil, and it may extend further west to the
edge of the old river channel. At present there is insufficient information to make a determination of
State Archeological Landmark status. As no impacts beyond mowing or shredding are expected, no
additional work is felt to be needed at this time. Additional impacts or future work for a distance of 500 ft
on either side of STR 17/4 will require additional cultural resource investigations to be considered. The
existing stream crossing does not appear to need major modification, but if such activities become
necessary, Archaeology Services should be consulted.
An area in which very sparse cultural materials (two flakes, a burned rock, all widely separated) was
located between STRs 4/9 and 5/3. There was not enough material observed to warrant designation as a
site, and due to the apparent limited nature of maintenance impacts, the investigation was limited to
surface reconnaissance along the stream crossings. Any future, more intensive work should look more
closely at this area.
Immediately west of STR 9/7 the plan and profile drawings indicate “2 small graves” that were present in
1927, but in 1958 were not visible. The plotted location of these graves was carefully examined for any
evidence of their presence. None was seen, although a single subangular slab of limestone was seen
within the pasture some distance to the west. The limestone is not native to this area, so it is possible it
once served as a head or footstone for one of the graves. So although it is possible the graves were
removed or destroyed sometime between 1927 and 1958, it is also possible they are still present. As they
would be located within open pasture, it is unlikely that any future projects would have a substantial
impact. However, if a large scale rebuild or other similar project should occur, additional investigations
using appropriate remote sensing would be warranted in order to ensure avoidance.
Structures 19/4 and 19/5 are on the west bank of Seals Creek, just outside of Luling. This is a Holocene
terrace and so has potential for deeply buried cultural materials. An examination of the Seals Creek bank
showed as much as 10 ft of alluvium. Further west of the creek, near structure 19/4, a flake and a burned
rock fragment were seen on the surface. Soils here apparently are shallow. Due to the lack of apparent
maintenance needs and the presence of noxious gases from a nearby wellhead, no further work was
conducted here. Future, more intensive projects will require additional cultural resource assessment.

347

Summary of Recommendations
As with all transmission maintenance projects, field investigations are conducted based on an
understanding of landforms, knowledge of previous work, and the apparent scope of maintenance
activities. Plowed fields or open pastures that have a high probability of containing an archaeological site
are not necessarily surveyed intensively, or even at all, if it appears that no work will be necessary.
The investigations along T-158 between the Seguin Split and the Luling substation were both interesting
and useful, especially when compared to the results of the investigations along T-203. Six previously
unrecorded archaeological sites were designated, and all six were campsites, an exception to the typical
project where nondescript lithic scatters or lithic procurements are the rule. This project therefore
demonstrates the potential for the ridge system between the San Marcos and Guadalupe Rivers to contain
sites that are important from a scientific perspective.
Out of the six recognized sites, none are felt to be fully investigated. If impacts to the sites can be limited
to standard, non-invasive techniques such as mowing, shredding, and hand cutting of trees, then no
additional investigations are necessary at this time. Replacement of existing poles is also acceptable.
Should heavy equipment be needed to regrade roads or stream crossings, or remove large woody
vegetation, then the locations proposed for these activities will need further evaluation before work may
proceed.
For the Seguin split to Luling section, these areas are, in order from west to east:

(note: this project was subsequently expanded to include full maintenance on the lines. The Luling to
Kenedy loop is included in this annual report as projects 58, 59, 62, 64, 65 and 67. The Glidden-El
Campo loop will be assessed in 2010.)
The LCRA Transmission Services Corporation is planning to add gates to existing fences that cross the
ROWs of transmissions lines acquired from American Electric Power (AEP) in Caldwell, Colorado,
DeWitt, Gonzales, and Karnes Counties. These lines form the Luling – Kenedy Loop (T-538 through T543) and the Glidden-El Camp Loop (T-544 through T-548), totaling 268 miles in length. Approximately
1000 gates new gates are anticipated.
Since any cultural deposits on or within a few inches of the ground surface have probably been disturbed
by fence construction, the main concerns are archeological deposits that might lie deeper and hence are
undisturbed and potentially significant. The construction of the gates themselves should cause only
negligible impacts to such deposits considering the small areas impacted at each gate site, mainly by the
installation of gate posts.
However, preparation of the ROW for access to construct the gates could do significant damage to buried
cultural deposits. Particularly troublesome would be the clearing of brush and small trees by heavy
machinery. As long as such impacts can be avoided either by choosing alternative access routes or by
clearing brush and trees in such ways that do not cause subsurface disturbances, such as with a Seppi
mulcher or by hand, then gate construction can proceed without further oversight from LCRA’s
Archeology Services.

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed FY10 maintenance work on Transmission Line T-387, which is also
known as the Howard Lane to Wells Branch line. The line extends for a length of 2.87 miles in Travis
County, Texas.
A file search showed that T-387 right-of-way (ROW) corridor was included within the cultural resource
survey of the proposed Wells Branch Subdivision in 1983 by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. No
cultural resource sites were found within or near the T-387 ROW area during that investigation.
Additionally, the file search indicated that LCRA’s T-136 line, which is runs parallel to T-387 at a
distance of about 20 meters west of T-387, was surveyed for cultural resources by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory staff in 1989 when T-136 was being upgraded. No cultural resource
sites were found within the portion of the T-136 ROW that runs adjacent to the T-387 line.
The file search data indicates that no cultural resource sites have ever been found within or near the T-387
ROW during previous surveys. Based on the previous studies, it is recommended that the proposed
maintenance work on the T-387 line be allowed to proceed without any restrictions. However, standard
emergency discovery provisions are always applicable. Should the personnel conducting the work
uncover any presently unknown buried archaeological materials during construction, then work should
cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be

Date of Investigation:

September 2009

The LCRA Transmission Services Corporation is planning to relocate three transmission line poles near
their Gillespie Substation in Fredericksburg. The new poles will be H-frame steel structures and will be
constructed on land owned by the LCRA. One pole will be relocated to a site in a cleared area a short
distance west of the existing west fence of the substation. This area was inspected by LCRA’s
Archeology Services in 2005 for a substation improvement project and was found to be bladed with no
evidence of the original soil surface.
The new locations for the other two poles will be on newly-purchased property north of the substation.
One of the poles will be placed in the southwest corner of a field close to Highway 87 while the second
one will be placed on the north edge of the field immediately east of the existing T-214 corridor. Both
these areas were investigated during a 2009 survey for the proposed substation expansion. While
prehistoric artifacts were found on the surface in these areas, no artifacts were recovered during
subsurface testing. These artifacts represent a northern extension of a previously recorded archeological
site, 41GL279. Because this portion of the site contains shallow cultural deposits disturbed by land
clearing, Archeology Services assessed it as ineligible for State Archeological Landmark status. The
Texas Historical Commission concurred with this assessment and the recommendation that the substation
expansion project proceed.
Since the poles will be relocated to areas previously surveyed for cultural resources that do not contain
significant cultural deposits, the project can proceed without additional oversight from the LCRA’s
Archeology Services.

Date of Investigation:

September 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed FY10 maintenance work on Transmission Line T-163. This
transmission line extends from the McNeil Substation to the Howard Lane Substation in northern Travis
County, Texas. This entire T-163 transmission line shares a right-of-way (ROW) corridor with T-136,
and the southern one-quarter also shares a wider ROW corridor that includes the T-147 and T-242 lines.
A file search showed that the T-163 ROW corridor was not surveyed for cultural resource sites prior to its
original construction because that construction predated the enactment of the State Antiquities Code.
However, substantial portions of the transmission line corridor were later surveyed as parts of various
development projects.
The southernmost one-third of the transmission line corridor lies within the City of Austin’s Walnut
Creek Park, which was surveyed for cultural resource sites by the consulting firm, Parks and Recreation
Associates, Inc. (Lynn 1978). Two cultural resource sites, 41TV370 and 41TV372, which were recorded
during the park survey extend across the transmission line ROW. These two sites are presently listed on
the National Register of Historic Places as parts of the Walnut Creek Archaeological District.
Additionally, these two sites have been formally designated as State Archeological Landmarks.
Portions of the northern half of the T-163 corridor lie within Scofield Farms Development which was
surveyed for cultural resources by Prewitt & Associates, Inc. (Prikryl and Ragsdale 1984). Two
archeological sites, 41TV861 and 41TV872, which were recorded during that survey extend across the
transmission line ROW. Neither of these two sites was assessed as significant.
Additionally, the file search indicated that LCRA’s T-136 line, which is runs parallel to T-163 at a
distance of about 15 meters east of T-163, was surveyed for cultural resources by the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory staff when T-136 was being upgraded (Bement 1989). Cultural materials associated
with previously recorded sites 41TV370, 41TV372, 41TV861, and 41TV872 were found within the T136 corridor. Bement (1989:9-10) stated that in light of previous disturbances, the proposed T-136
upgrade activities did not pose any new or substantial threat to cultural deposits at 41TV370 and
41TV372. He also agreed with the previous assessment that no significant or potentially significant
cultural resources were present at 41TV861 or 41TV872.
Last of all, during LCRA’s in-house cultural resource assessment for the proposed rebuild of the T-147
line, a reconnaissance of some parts of the T-163 ROW within Walnut Creek Park was conducted to
ensure that vehicular traffic associated with the rebuild would not damage any intact parts of sites
41TV370 and 41TV372 (Prikryl 2007). All parts of the two sites within the T-163 corridor that were
examined were found to have been substantially damaged by the original transmission line construction.
In conclusion, the file search showed that all high probability areas for cultural resource sites along the T163 corridor have previously investigated. These investigations indicate that the T-163 ROW crosses
four cultural resource sites, 41TV370, 41TV372, 41TV861, and 41TV872. The original transmission line

construction heavily damaged the deposits at sites 41TV370 and 41TV372 to the extent that it is doubtful
that the maintenance activities would cause any further damage. Cultural materials at the other two sites,
41TV861 and 41TV872, were originally assessed as insignificant, and thus are not of concern.
Therefore, it is recommended that the proposed maintenance work on the T-163 line be allowed to
proceed without any restrictions. However, standard emergency discovery provisions are always
applicable. Should the personnel conducting the work uncover any presently unknown buried
archaeological materials during construction, then work should cease in the immediate area of the
discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted.

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed FY10 maintenance work on Transmission Line T-470. This
transmission line extends from the South Abilene Substation to the Eskota Switch in Taylor County,
Texas.
A file search showed that the T-470 right-of-way (ROW) corridor was not surveyed for cultural resource
sites prior to its original construction. However, it was surveyed for cultural resource sites by PBS&J in
2002 when LCRA was planning to purchase the line from American Electric Power (AEP) and then
rebuild the line (Sherman et al. 2003). As a result of PBS&J’s investigation, five new archaeological sites
consisting of 41TA244 – 41TA248 were recorded and assessed. Additionally, two previously recorded
archaeological sites, 41TA1 and 41TA53, were revisited and assessed by PBS&J. With the exception of
41TA1, the portions of all of these sites within the transmission line ROW were quickly assessed as
insignificant and not eligible for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
At 41TA1, cultural materials including mammoth/mastodon bones along with other artifacts and features
greater than 10,000 years in age had originally been found at depths of 7.6 meters (25 ft) below ground
surface back in the 1930s. PBS&J excavated backhoe trenches down to depths of 3.6 meters (11.8 ft) at
41TA1 and later monitored the excavation of footings for two transmission structures that were dug down
to maximum depth of 4.8 meters (16 ft) below ground surface within the site boundaries. No significant
cultural materials were found, and it was concluded that the rebuild activities had no impact on 41TA1.
Beyond the work conducted by PBS&J, the file search indicated that no additional cultural resource sites
have been recorded within or near the transmission line ROW since PBS&J’s work in 2002 and 2003.
The only cultural resource site of concern on the T-470 line continues to be 41TA1. Site 41TA1 is
located on Elm Creek north of Antilley Road in an area where the transmission line crosses the deeply
entrenched, meandering creek channel twice. There is still some possibility that cultural materials are
present in cutbanks of Elm Creek at depths greater than the 4.8 meter (16 ft) below ground surface within
the transmission line corridor. The sensitive area extends from Antilley Road to a point about 1,200 feet
northwestward on the line ROW. It is recommended that maintenance crews not engage in any activities
that will cause ground disturbance or erosion of the creek cutbank slopes in these areas. Any vegetation
that requires cutting on the creek slopes should be hand cut. Additionally, no creek bank areas in this
sensitive zone should be altered for creation of low water crossings for construction machinery.
Aside from these special conditions in the area of site 41TA1, it is recommended that the proposed
maintenance work on all other parts of the T-470 corridor be allowed to proceed without any restrictions.
However, standard emergency discovery provisions are always applicable. Should the personnel
conducting the work uncover any presently unknown buried archaeological materials during construction,
then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff
should be contacted.

LCRA TSC proposes add vibration tensioners to the Fort Lancaster to Friend Ranch T-438 transmission
line located in Pecos, Crocket and Terrell counties, Texas This line was surveyed cultural resource sites
prior to its construction by American Electric Power (AEP) by Blanton and Associates archaeologists in
2004. Follow-up testing and mitigation of select sites was conducted through 2005. Although the final
report has not yet been published, an interim report provided enough information to provide guidance for
future projects such as maintenance and this one. There are 15 archaeological sites where some degree of
awareness and avoidance are still necessary. For the most part, avoidance can be achieved simply by
staying on existing tracks along the ROW or while approaching it. In some cases it is recommended that
work at specific structures be limited to one or another side of the ROW. These recommendations are
unnecessary for non-ground disturbing work, i.e., if the project is done by helicopter. These
recommendations also serve as an interim management plan as requested by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) during the original survey project.
The most efficient way to ensure avoidance at the locations specified below will be to provide aerial maps
to construction crews prior to construction activities. If this project will be done by vehicles and ground
equipment, please contact LCRA Archaeology Services prior to construction so that such maps can be
provided to construction crews.
Each avoidance area is summarized below:
Structure 5 (41PC575)
Beginning 250 ft west of the STR, stay on existing road when west of structure. Avoid setting up
equipment on west side of structure.
Structure 8 (41CX918)
Beginning 250 west of the structure, stay on the existing road until 500 ft past the structure. An 80 ft
work radius around the structure is acceptable.
Structure 10 (41CX919)
Stay on existing road from 250 ft west to 150 ft east of structure. Avoid south edge of ROW to southwest
of structure.
Structure 16 (41CX922)
Stay on existing road for a distance of 450 ft on either side of the structure. Take special care at a point
300-330 ft west of the structure to stay on road. An 80 ft work radius around the structure is acceptable.
Structures 32, 33, 34, 35 (41CX232)
Stay on existing road beginning between STRs 31 and 32. An 80 ft work radius around each structure is
acceptable. Travel along the existing road in the adjacent transmission line ROW is also acceptable.
Structure 36 (41CX924)

361

Stay on existing road between STRs 36 and 37. Be sure to stay south of centerline in the area between the
two STRs. At STR 36 do not go outside north edge of ROW.
Structure 67 (41CX1)
No restrictions. This site was fully mitigated.
Structure 71 (41CX926)
Stay on existing road for a distance of 350 ft west of structure. An 80 ft work radius around the structure
is acceptable.
Structures 92, 93 (41CX930)
Beginning 200 ft west of STR 92 stay on existing road until reaching STR 93. Work at STR 92 should be
within the ROW. If travel outside the ROW is necessary here, be sure to stay on existing roads.
Structures 120, 121 (41CX937)
Stay on existing roads between these two structures. No work restrictions at structure locations.
Structure 130 (41CX917)
Stay on existing road from STR 129 to a point 500 ft east of STR 130. Restrict vehicular and equipment
movement to the north side of the ROW when working at STR 130.
Structure 152 (41CX940)
Stay on ROW for a distance of 300 ft to the west. If structure must be approached from ranch road to
north be sure to stay on existing road until reaching ROW. No work restrictions at structure location.
Structure 156 (41CX941)
Stay on existing roads when outside the ROW in the vicinity of this structure. No work restrictions at
structure location.
Structure 169 (41CX942)
Stay on existing roads in vicinity of this structure. No work restrictions at the structure location.
Structures 185, 186, 197, 188, 189 (41CX943)
Stay on existing roads and access corridors. Approach STR 189 from the west. Otherwise no work
restrictions at any structures.
Structure 237 (41CX933)
Stay on existing roads in the area 300 ft east of this structure. No work restrictions at structure location.

LCRA TSC proposes to add vibration tensioners to the Rio Pecos to LCRA Crane T-451 transmission
line in Crockett and Crane Counties, Texas. This line was surveyed for cultural resources in 2003 by
PBS&J archaeologists prior to its rebuild by American Electric Power (AEP) and subsequent purchase by
LCRA. No archaeological sites were found during the survey, and there were no avoidance or other
cultural resource constraints for the project. Therefore, LCRA Archaeology Services recommends that
the proposed Reliability Improvement project be allowed to proceed. No additional consultation with
LCRA Archaeology Services is necessary for this project as proposed.

transmission line in Pecos County, Texas. This line was surveyed for cultural resources in 2002 by
PBS&J archaeologists prior to its upgrade by American Electric Power (AEP) and LCRA. Six
archaeological sites were found during the survey, although only one was recommended for any kind of
avoidance. Site 41PC568 contains structure # 63. Recommendations are that all traffic remain in the
ROW between the small drainage just south of STR 63 northwards for a distance of 500 feet. If this
becomes impossible then LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted for additional guidance.

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

October 2009

The LCRA’s Transmission Services Corporation is planning routine maintenance on their T-221
transmission line between the Verde Creek and Turtle Creek Substations. A file search by LCRA’s
Archeology Services staff found that one archeological site, 41KR333, had been recorded within the T221 ROW however no documentation on this site is on file at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL). Site 41KR333 and others in the nearby area that lie outside the T-221 ROW were
presumably recorded during a Texas Archeological Society Field School in the 1970s and site forms
never submitted to TARL. No evidence was found during the file search that the T-221 corridor was ever
systematically surveyed by professional archeologists.
From September 29 to October 1, LCRA’s Archeology Services staff conducted a survey of selected
segments of the T-221 corridor. The survey focused on areas where the line crosses creeks since any
unrecorded archeological sites at those locations could be impacted should vehicular crossings be
constructed during the maintenance project.
During the survey four archeological sites were recorded, 41KR681 through 41KR684. Two of the sites,
41KR681 located on both sides of Structure 2/2 (Figure 191) and 41KR683 (Figure 192) located
immediately east of Structure 5/8, were recorded while the survey crew was traversing low ridges to reach
stream crossings. Both sites are classified as lithic scatters, areas where stone tools were made and
refurbished. Such activities were often carried out on elevated positions or overlooks. Because both sites
lack features and contain mostly chipping debris, neither meets the criteria necessary for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark
(SAL).
The other two sites recorded during the survey, 41KR682 and 41KR684 (Figure 192), lie close to streams
and both are classified as prehistoric campsites. Site 41KR682, located on the east side of Fall Creek
mostly west of Structure 7/4, is the most substantial of the two in terms of the amount of burned rock, a
byproduct of cooking activities. A moderate amount of chipping debris was seen on the surface as well as
a Montell projectile point which dates to around 500 BC. A shovel test placed in a low mound feature
within the ROW encountered dense amounts of burned rock to a depth of eight inches. No cultural
material was found below this depth. The mound appears to be a natural feature on which thin midden
deposits accumulated. Since the cultural deposits are shallow and most likely disturbed by land clearing,
the portion of 41KR682 within the T-221 ROW is not eligible for listing on the NRHP or for designation
as a SAL.
The other prehistoric campsite, 41KR684, is located on the east side of a unnamed tributary to Fall Creek
60 meters west of Structure 7/1. Most of the cultural material at this site was observed on the surface of
eroded areas within the ROW, particularly along a dirt road that runs under the transmission lines. Two
small concentrations of burned rocks were noted on the north side of the ROW and a complete limestone
metate (grinding slab) was seen in the road along with flint chipping debris. A shovel test placed in an
area with intact soil adjacent to one of the burned rock concentrations encountered bedrock six inches
below the surface. Bedrock is also exposed in the dirt road so obviously the soil cover within the ROW
was thin before recent disturbances and now mostly absent due to erosion. Because of the absence of

370

intact archeological deposits, the portion of 41KR684 within the transmission line ROW is not considered
eligible for NRHP listing or for SAL status.
No evidence of the previously recorded site, 41KR333, was seen at the location plotted on the TARL
maps. The site was presumably incorrectly plotted by its recorders and must lie elsewhere, probably
outside the T-221 corridor.
To summarize, four archeological sites were recorded during the survey. All the sites lack intact
archeological deposits within the ROW and do not need to be avoided during the upcoming maintenance
project. Elsewhere if any unexpected archeological material is encountered, please cease operations at the
find site and contact Archeological Services so an evaluation can be made.

(The following text is from a 2004 memo by Dan Prikryl to Clover Clamons. The recommendations have
not changed, except for at 41FY178, which was incorrect in the original. In summary there are 13
archaeological sites that are recommended for impact minimization through hand clearing and avoiding
soils disturbance. In the event that any of these areas cannot be avoided, LCRA Archaeology Services
can revisit the sites and evaluate any changes since they were first recorded 30 years ago. Some sites may
no longer be potentially significant and once reported on to the Texas Historical Commission [THC]
would no longer require avoidance in the future [assuming THC concurrence.] )
The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed FY 04 clearing and maintenance work on Transmission Line T254/255, which is also known as the FPP to Lytton Springs Transmission Line. The assessment consisted
of a file search and field reconnaissance of select areas where some previously recorded, potentially
significant archeological sites were recorded in the early 1980s.
The file search consisted of a check of the Texas Historical Commission’s computized Site Atlas and the
LCRA’s internal cultural resource files. The file search indicated that the entire T 254/255 transmission
line right-of-way (ROW) was surveyed for cultural resource sites in 1979 and 1980 by the Texas
Archeological Survey. A total of 37 prehistoric sites and 21 historic sites were recorded during the survey
investigation. Of these, 12 prehistoric sites and 1 historic site were assessed as potentially significant
cultural resource sites that would require avoidance or additional investigations if avoidance was not
feasible.
Subsequently, three of the prehistoric sites, 41BP176, 41FY165, and 41FY178, were test excavated due to
upcoming unavoidable impacts from the proposed transmission line construction, as was one historic site,
41FY189. The test excavations appeared to support the original assessments that all four sites had some
research potential. The transmission line work at these four sites and at those other sites originally
assessed as potentially significant was then monitored by TAS archeologists to ensure that potential
impacts to these three sites would be minimized.
For the current clearing and maintenance project, field reconnaissance consisted of revisits to 6 of the 13
sites that had been assessed as significant and potentially significant. Those sites revisited were
41BP173, 41BP176, 41BP194, 41FY154, 41FY163, and 41FY165. Field methodology consisted of
reconnaissance level pedestrian survey during which the ground surface, especially bare and eroded areas,
was examined for indications of cultural materials. Cutbanks on stream channels and in gullies were also
inspected for evidences of buried sites.
Overall, the field reconnaissance suggested that 1) the potential significance of the six sites had been
over-rated, 2) the current condition of the sites ranges from fair (at best) to very poor, and 3) there does
not appear to be any tree trimming and/or brush removal needed along the vast majority of the
transmission line ROW. The only revisited site with any vegetation that might require removal is
41BP176. There, mesquite bushes have grown up within the area containing the historic component of
this site. The archeologist placed a row of pin flags along the south edge of the transmission line ROW to

375

mark this area. Mowing this area is acceptable but any other type of vegetation removal should be done
by hand-clearing so that subsurface deposits are not damaged. This restriction at 41BP176 extends from
about 100 to 160 ft east-southeast of existing Transmission Structure #197.
Although the field reconnaissance suggested little need for any precautions at the other five sites revisited,
Transmission Services personnel conducting the clearing and maintenance activities should, nevertheless,
the same restrictions concerning vegetation removal at these sites applies in the same manner as site
41BP176. These sites and their locations in relation to certain existing Transmission Structures are as
follows:
41BP173: From 90 ft west of Transmission Structure #211 to the east edge of F. M. Highway #672;
41BP176: From 100 to 160 ft. east-southeast of Transmission Structure #197;
41BP194: From 370 to 590 ft. west of Transmission Structure #203;
41FY154: From 150 to 340 ft. east-southeast of Transmission Structure #111;
41FY155: From 300 to 440 ft west-northwest of Transmission Structure #99;
41FY158: From 35 to 80 ft. east of Transmission Structure #80;
41FY163: From Transmission Structure #50 to 80 ft to the east of this Structure;
41FY165: From 480 ft northeast of Transmission Structure #33 to 170 ft. southwest of this Structure;
41FY166: From 400 ft northeast of Transmission Structure #9 to 330 ft west of this Structure;
41FY171: From 240 to 460 ft east-southeast of Transmission Structure #97;
41FY172: From 180 to 400 ft east-southeast of Transmission Structure #96;
41FY178: From the small stream just west of Transmission Structure 80 for a distance of 300 ft west,
hand clear north one-half of ROW. Southern one-half of ROW has no restrictions.
41FY189: From 120 ft east-southeast of Transmission Structure #86 to 20 ft west-northwest of this
Structure.
Elsewhere, all clearing and maintenance activities may proceed without any restrictions. Should the
personnel conducting the work uncover any presently unknown buried archeological materials on other
areas, then work should cease in the immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archeology Services
staff should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272, ext. 6714. LCRA staff will then work with the Texas
Historical Commission to assess the emergency discovery finding and determine if any
avoidance/mitigation measures are needed. In such a situation, work can continue in other areas where no
archeological materials are present.

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

October 2009

LCRA proposes to remove hazardous and other illegally dumped and constructed materials from LCRA’s
Lake Travis Bee Creek tract located in western Travis County. The primary dump is an excavated trench
that has been progressively filled with metal drums, car parts, air conditioning parts, various bottles and
cans, carpets and other materials. As the trench filled, the trash was burned and then backfilled as a new
trench was opened. Elsewhere, a cinderblock outhouse, a collapsed wood frame building, a cement
foundation and a potential cement sewer line will be investigated and then razed or otherwise cleaned up.
Various pieces of heavy equipment will be used for the project.
The project area was investigated by LCRA Archaeology Services staff on October 8, 2009. There is one
previously recorded archaeological site, 41TV1107, a minor lithic scatter recorded in 1985, located within
potions of the project area. The site was considered to be ineligible for state or federal listings. The site
was addressed by LCRA Archaeology Services staff during 2006 maintenance work on T-458. The
materials within and around the trench dated mostly to the 1960s and later, with the exception of a truck
bed that perhaps dated to the 1940s, and stove or heater parts that probably date to about the same time.
All these materials are in secondary context, and the dump itself is not considered an archaeological site.
The trench is at the base of an upland ridge with very little soil over caliche and limestone. No prehistoric
or early historic artifacts were seen in the numerous exposures.
All other areas proposed for cleanup were investigated visually. They have all been previously disturbed
by construction and are in areas of shallow soils. They are all of recent age. No shovel testing was
considered to be necessary.
Because the project area is less than two acres in size, no new archaeological sites were recorded, and
41TV1107 has been recently addressed during an archaeological assessment, no additional cultural
resource coordination is necessary. This project will be reported to the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) as part of the annual report of investigations for 2009.

Date of Investigation:

September 2009

The LCRA’s Archeology Services has completed its investigation of the proposed North Shore Group
Tent Camp project on Lake Bastrop in Bastrop County. The project is located in a wooded area between
the existing North Shore Park parking lot on the east and an inlet to Lake Bastrop on the west. The project
will involve the construction of a new road leading from the existing parking lot to the new tent camp,
parking spaces for five vehicles, 10 tent pads, a pavilion, a two-unit restroom, stage platform, campfire
ring, benches, buried utility lines, and a new dumpster pad. The total project area covers 76,000 ft 2 or
approximately 1.7 acre.
Since the area had not been investigated before for cultural resources, Archeology Services staff
conducted a field survey of the project area on October 27, 2009. The survey involved walking across
areas where construction is planned and inspecting the ground for artifacts and cultural features. Four
shovel tests were placed in different areas to search for buried archeological components. Each shovel
test involved the excavation of a small (14” diameter) hole and putting the dirt through a ¼” mesh to
recover artifacts. In addition to shovel testing, a magnetic locator was used to detect any possible buried
iron ordinance in the construction area left over from military training activities at Fort Swift during the
1940s.
The survey found no artifacts on the surface within the project area other than wire and sheet metal, both
difficult to date precisely but probably modern. No artifacts were recovered from the shovel tests and no
buried iron objects were detected with the magnetic locator. Since no archeological sites are located
within the project area and the total area of the project covers less than two acres, a report does not need
to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission for approval and the project can proceed without further
oversight by Archeology Services.

Date of Investigation:

October 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed lease of acreage in LCRA’s Mansfield Dam East property to the
Travis County WCID #17 for the construction of a water treatment plant. The proposed water treatment
plant will be constructed on an approximately 4-acre sized plot. Other associated project elements
include a water intake pipeline that will be tunneled from Lake Travis to the plant, a 20 ft wide access
road from the plant to the lake shore, a water pipeline that will extend from the plant to RR 620 to connect
to the existing WCID system, and a 20ft wide wastewater easement that will extend from the water plant
eastward along the north edge of RR 620 to the edge of an existing subdivision.
A file search showed that the LCRA Archaeology Services had started a cultural resource survey for an
earlier proposed version of the Travis County WCID #17 water treatment plant project in December 2000.
At that time the preferred location of the proposed plant was further westward on land leased from LCRA
by the University of Texas. An alternative site for the plant was plotted as partially extending into the
location of the current project. However, the entire project was discontinued in early 2001 before a
cultural resource assessment was completed.
In 2006, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff was contacted by Jerry Henderson, a consulting
archaeologist who had been hired by the Travis County WCID #17 to complete a cultural resource survey
of a newly proposed water treatment plant project. Our staff provided background materials from our
earlier investigation to Henderson to aid in her work.
Henderson subsequently completed an intensive survey of the proposed 4 acre water treatment plant site,
the associated water intake pipeline, and the short water pipeline that will extend from the plant to RR
620. One cultural resource site, 41TV2182, was recorded and assessed. This archaeological site contains
a historic component consisting of the remains of a 1930’s government workers’ camp associated with the
construction of Mansfield Dam, and a prehistoric component consisting of a very sparse lithic scatter.
Archival research determined that the government workers’ camp consisted of a single residential street
lined with eight frame structures on each side. The camp was mechanically razed after the dam was
completed so that only a few concrete foundations and curbs, and a few rusted metal cans and glass
fragments are still present. Henderson assessed the historic remains as insignificant. The prehistoric
component was also assessed as insignificant due to the lack of features and the absence of any
subsurface deposits. In March 2006, the Texas Historical Commission (THC) concurred with
Henderson’s assessments of the two components at 41TV2182.
Review of the currently proposed project indicates that the presently proposed water treatment plant site
is at the same location that Henderson investigated in 2006. However, two new project elements did not
appear to have been covered by Henderson’s work. These consist of the proposed assess road extending
from the plant to the lake and the proposed wastewater pipeline easement that runs from the southeast
edge of the plant eastward along the edge of RR 620 to a subdivision. On October 20, 2009, two
members of the LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted an intensive field survey of these two areas.
The fieldwork consisted of pedestrian survey and shovel testing. The proposed access road corridor from
the water plant to the lake was found to have good ground surface visibility and to partially coincide with

382

an existing road. Several isolated chert flakes and chips were found along the road corridor, but the low
number of artifacts and the lack of any artifact concentrations were not sufficient to record these materials
as an extension of site 41TV2182. A shovel test was also excavated on the top edge of the bluff that
overlooks the lake. The shovel test showed just 13 cm of dark clay loam topsoil above limestone
bedrock. No artifacts were found in the screening of the fill.
Field survey of the proposed wastewater pipeline easement showed a small part of the previously
recorded historic component of 41TV2182 is situated at the west end of the proposed pipeline corridor.
Historic materials seen there extend from 12 to 70 meters east of the former residential street that
generally marks the east edge of the water treatment plant. These materials consist of a flat mortared
limestone foundation that measures about 3x3 ft, a sidewalk fragment that measures about 2x2 ft, and a
trash scatter that mostly consists of rusted metal cans.
The historic features seen within and near the proposed wastewater line easement lay within the
41TV2182 site area that has already assessed by Henderson and the THC as insignificant. Therefore, the
proposed use of the area for the construction of the wastewater pipeline may proceed. Additionally, we
conclude that there are no significant archaeological remains within the proposed access road easement
that extends from the water plant to the lake. Based on the results of current fieldwork and Henderson’s
previous survey, all project elements are cleared for construction and usage. Since the areas examined
during the current field investigation are less than 2 acres, a report does not have to written and submitted
to the THC at this time. Instead, the proposed construction may proceed by virtue of this memo, and the
report of the field investigation will be submitted to the THC in our 2009 Annual Report to the THC next
spring.

Project 58.09 T-541 transmission line maintenance
(Figure 197)
County(s):

DeWitt, Karnes

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

November 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resources desktop review for the proposed FY10 maintenance work on Transmission Line T-541. This
transmission line extends from the Kenedy SW Substation to the Cuero Substation for a length of 45.1
miles in Karnes and DeWitt Counties, Texas.
A file search showed that the T-541 ROW corridor has not previously been formally field surveyed for
cultural resource sites. However, one known archaeological site that was recorded west of Cuero, Texas
by avocational archaeologists partially lies within the transmission line right-of-way (ROW). This site,
41DW6, is a large prehistoric campsite that apparently extends from creek bottomland land up onto a
hilltop that overlooks the Guadalupe River floodplain. The site is situated near a large spring and it
contains evidences of aboriginal occupation from the Late Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods.
The portion of the transmission line extending from structure (STR) #508 to a point about 200 feet
northwest of STR #513 is situated within the boundaries of this archaeological site. Based on the
description of the site on the Texas Historical Commission’s computerized Site Atlas, the site is
potentially significant, and special conditions are needed for upcoming maintenance activities. Brush/tree
clearing should be accomplished through use of a sepii machine or by hand clearing to avoid subsurface
damage to cultural deposits at 41DW6. Work crews should use any existing roads within the
archaeological site boundaries for vehicular traffic before cutting any new road pathways within the
ROW. Last of all, to minimize damage to subsurface deposits at this site from tire ruts, heavy vehicles
should not pass through the archaeological site boundaries during wet weather conditions.
Aside from the special conditions for the one known archaeological site, there are many areas that may
contain unrecorded archaeological sites that could be impacted by maintenance work. In particular,
unrecorded archaeological sites located adjacent to stream channels could be adversely affected by
subsurface disturbances caused by tree/brush clearing activities and by alteration of terrace stream banks
for construction of low water creek crossings. Review of topographic maps suggests that unrecorded
archaeological sites that might be affected by such activities could be present along stream channels
within the following areas:
1. From 100 ft. southwest of STR 34 the location of STR 35,
2. From 170 ft. southeast of STR 2 to 210 ft southeast of STR 3,
3. From 200 ft northeast of STR 51 to the location of STR 53,
4. From 80 ft. southwest of STR 67 to 200 ft northeast of STR 69,
5. From 80 ft. southeast of STR 77 to the location of STR 78,
6. From the location of STR 82 to the location of STR 83,
7. From 100 ft northeast of STR 92 to 250 ft. northeast of STR 93,
8. From the location of STR 139 to the location of STR 140,
9. From 150 ft. southwest of STR 208 to 150 ft northeast of STR 209,
10. From 150 ft southwest of STR 216 to 150 ft northeast of STR 217,
11. From 250 ft southwest of STR 224 to the location of STR 225,
12. From 150 ft southwest of STR 237 to 150 ft west of STR 238,
13. From 150 ft west of STR 268 to 100 ft east of STR 269,

385

14. From 100 ft northeast of STR 298 to the location of STR 300,
15. From the location of STR 504 to the location of STR 506,
16. From 50 ft northwest of STR 523 to 150 ft northwest of STR 525,
17. From 100 ft west of STR 531 to the location of STR 532, and
18. From 50 ft north of STR 572 to the location of STR 574.
It is recommended that all brush and tree clearing within the 18 areas listed above be done with a sepii
machine to avoid damaging subsurface soil deposits. Additionally, should the maintenance crews want to
cut into or alter the terrace banks of stream channels within any of these 18 areas for the construction of
low water crossings for vehicles, then the Archaeology Services staff will first need to conduct a field
visit to the specific area to determine if any significant archaeological sites are present. The Archaeology
Services staff can be contacted at 1-800-776-5272, ext. 6714 or 2753 to arrange for such trips. Please
provide two weeks advance notice to our staff for such field trips.
Aside from the special conditions relating to archaeological site 41DW6 and the 18 other areas listed
above, the proposed maintenance work on the T-541 line may proceed. However, standard emergency
discovery provisions are always applicable. Should the personnel conducting the work uncover any
presently unknown buried archaeological materials during construction, then work should cease in the
immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted.

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resources desktop review for the proposed FY10 maintenance work on Transmission Line T-542. This
transmission line extends from the Cuero Hydro Substation to the Cuero Substation for a length of just
2.71 miles in DeWitt County, Texas.
A file search showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within or near the T-542
ROW corridor, and that this transmission line ROW has not previously been formally field surveyed for
cultural resource sites. A review of topographic maps showed that the transmission line crosses two
creeks, but both of these are small upland channels. Both of these creek crossing areas are assessed as
having a low probability for any unrecorded prehistoric cultural resource sites. Historic maps consisting
of the 1908 Cuero 30’ USGS map and the 1960 Cuero and Concrete 7.5’ USGS maps were consulted to
determine if any historic houses or other buildings had ever been located within or near the transmission
line ROW. No such historic structures were found on those maps within or near the project area.
Based on the results of the file search, it is recommended that the proposed maintenance work be allowed
to proceed without any special conditions or restrictions. However, standard emergency discovery
provisions are always applicable. Should the personnel conducting the work uncover any presently
unknown buried archaeological materials during construction, then work should cease in the immediate
area of the discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted at 1-800-776-5272
ext. 6714 so that the find can be reported to the Texas Historical Commission and a determination can be
made as to whether any avoidance/mitigation measures are needed.

(Figure 199)
County(s):

Burnet

Type of Investigation:

Date of Investigation:

November 2009

LCRA and the Texas Forest Service have recognized an area containing diseased oak trees at LCRA’s
Turkey Bend West Park, located in extreme southern Burnet County, Texas. Approximately 36 trees in a
7-acre area have been identified as infected by oak wilt. In order to contain the spread of the disease
LCRA proposes to excavate a trench around the trees. The project will consist of first using a sepie to
mulch a path 12-14 feet wide, enough for specialized trenching equipment to use the path to cut a trench
about 6 inches wide and 4 feet deep. Total area of ground disturbance is about 1 acre.
A cultural resources assessment of the project area was conducted on November 19, 2009 by LCRA
Archaeology Services staff. The assessment consisted of a file search.
Turkey Bend has been surveyed over the past 30 years at various times, the earliest for brush control and
fence projects. Beginning in about 1996 a systematic inventory survey was begun. At present, 69
archaeological sites have been recorded at Turkey Bend Park. The area proposed for the oak wilt trench
has been systematically surveyed and no cultural resource sites have been recorded within it. It is in an
upland setting with little topsoil and dense juniper vegetation. Topographically it is considered to be a
low probability area for intact prehistoric cultural resource sites.
Because this area has been previously surveyed with negative findings and the impact is less than 2 acres,
the project may proceed without additional consultation with Archaeology Services.

Date of Investigation:

November 2009

Hurst Harbor Marina on the south shore of Lake Travis plans to dredge approximately three acres of lake
bottom in the cove in front of their boat ramp. A very small portion of this area, about 0.1 acre, lies on
LCRA property while the rest is on private property. In addition, a haul route will be used running from
the proposed dredging site to the Sail and Ski Marina on the opposite side of the cove. Most of this route,
approximately 600 linear feet, will traverse LCRA property and will cover an area of 0.6 acre.
After reviewing photos of the project area, it does not appear that intact soil is present in the proposed
dredging site, nor is intact soil present along the path of the proposed haul route. In many places, the soil
appears to have eroded down to bedrock. This means that any archeological sites in LCRA portion of the
project area have been washed away or are seriously compromised by erosion from waves. The dredging
can proceed without further oversight from Archeological Services. The information in this memo will be
included in the LCRA Annual Report of Cultural Resource Investigations for Calendar Year 2009.

Date of Investigation:

December 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resources desktop review for the proposed FY10 maintenance work on Transmission Line T-538. This
transmission line extends from the Luling Station to the Malone Substation to the Darst Creek Substation,
to the Nixon Substation in Caldwell, Guadalupe, and Gonzales counties, Texas.
A file search showed that the T-538 ROW corridor has not previously been formally field surveyed for
cultural resource sites. However, the transmission line corridor passes through one cultural resource site,
41CW28, that was recorded by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) staff in 1982 on the south edge
of Luling, Texas. This site is the Zedler’s Mill and Dam site, which is located on the both sides of the
Guadalupe River adjacent to the spot where the State Highway 80 crosses the San Marcos River. A THC
historical marker is located on the edge of the highway adjacent to the site. The mill and dam were
constructed in 1874 and the associated complex of buildings included the main mill building, a weighing
scale, a residence, stables, hay barns, and other smaller buildings associated with the mill operation. The
dam was constructed of stone, and is still in place presently. In 1884, Luling Water and Power bought the
mill and operations did not cease until 1960. Although the LCRA T-538 line right-of-way (ROW) does
not pass over the mill building or dam, the ROW corridor does pass through the southeastern part of the
site where artifacts could be present and where former buildings associated with the mill complex may
have once stood. The portion of the transmission line ROW within the site extends from about 50 feet
southwest of transmission pole Structure 59 to about 50 feet southwest of Structure 60. Included in this
area is the San Marcos River crossing and an apparent public park on the northeast bank of the river
channel. Within the site area, it is recommended that any brush removal or tree trimming be done by
hand. It is also recommended that heavy vehicles not drive over the site area during wet weather
conditions to avoid creating deep tire ruts that could damage subsurface deposits.

Aside from the special conditions for the one known archaeological site, there are many areas that may
contain unrecorded archaeological sites that could be impacted by maintenance work. In particular,
unrecorded archaeological sites located adjacent to stream channels could be adversely affected by
subsurface disturbances caused by tree/brush clearing activities and by alteration of terrace stream banks
for construction of low water creek crossings. Review of topographic maps suggests that unrecorded
archaeological sites that might be affected by such activities could be present along stream channels
within the following areas:
Luling Substation to Malone Substation to Darst Creek Substation Section:
1. From 200 feet northwest of STR #14 to the location of STR #15,
2. From the location of STR #74 to the location of STR #77,
3. From the location of STR #101 to 60 feet northeast of STR #103,
4. From 50 feet northeast of STR #155 to the location of STR #157,
5. From 80 feet north of STR 213 to 30 feet north of STR #216, and
6. From 80 feet north of STR 236 to 70 feet north of STR #239.
Darst Creek Substation to Nixon Substation Section:

394

From the location of STR #33 to the location of STR #34,
From 120 feet north of STR #114 to 80 feet south of STR #115,
From 140 feet north of STR #136 to 90 feet south of STR #137,
From 50 feet south of STR #143 to 160 feet north of STR #145,
From 100 feet north of STR #184 to 180 feet south of STR #186, and
From 170 feet northeast of STR #188A to the location of STR #188B.
It is recommended that all brush and tree clearing within the 12 areas listed above be done with a sepii
machine rather than a bulldozer to avoid damaging subsurface soil deposits. Additionally, should the
maintenance crews want to cut into or alter the terrace banks of stream channels within any of these 12
areas for the construction of low water crossings for vehicles, then the Archaeology Services staff will
first need to conduct a field visit to the specific area to determine if any significant archaeological sites
are present. The Archaeology Services staff can be contacted at 1-800-776-5272, ext. 6714 or 2753 to

November 2009

LCRA Archaeology Services has completed a preliminary cultural resources assessment of the T-543
Luling to Cuero Transmission line project. This 51.69 mile long line was recently acquired from
American Electric Power (AEP). The line runs from Luling to Cuero in Caldwell, DeWitt and Gonzales
counties. It is unknown what level of maintenance has previously occurred on this line.
A cultural resources assessment was conducted in November, 2009. It consisted of a map and file review.
It was determined that the line has not been previously surveyed for cultural resources, although it is
parallel with portions of T-173, which was surveyed in 1981, and is partially within the Cuero I National
Register of Historic Places Archaeological District. The Cuero Power Plant, adjacent to the Cuero
substation, is also listed as a National Register property. Where the line crosses the Guadalupe River, just
south of Gonzales, it coincides with the location of a river crossing that dates to the Spanish Colonial
period. A Texas historical maker claims this is the location where the “Old Eighteen” gathered enough
recruits to answer the Mexican army’s demand for their small cannon with the reply “Come and take it.”
This line crosses numerous streams, where there is a higher likelihood for there to be substantial
archaeological sites. These stream crossings were assessed based on topography. Selected stream
crossings and other settings near or in previously recorded sites that are within the National Register
district were marked on topographic maps then overlaid with structure locations from which the high
probability areas are referenced and summarized in tabular form. These high probability areas are
locations where ground disturbance should be minimized. In particular, there should be no modifications
to existing creek banks, and any vegetation clearing (especially tree removal) should be done without root
disturbance (i.e. no bulldozing).
If any of the areas described in the attached tables cannot be avoided as described above, Archaeology
Services should be contacted two weeks prior to the disturbance so that a field assessment can be
conducted. If the assessment indicated that potentially significant archaeological sites are present in any
of these areas, then additional testing and/or mitigation may be necessary prior to disturbance.
The attached table numbers each avoidance segment starting at Luling, then describes the avoidance area
by beginning distance in feet and direction from a numbered structure, then ending distance in feet and
direction from a numbered structure. Note that there is some repetition in structure numbers in the Luling
and Cuero areas. If bearing is “AT” and distance is “0” then the actual structure is the beginning or end
point.

Project 66.09 T-382 and T-185/246 transmission line relocation for SH130
(Figure 204)
County(s):

Caldwell

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

February 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resource assessment for the proposed relocation of transmission structures on Transmission Lines T-382
and T-185/246 that will be required to accommodate the construction of State Highway 130 (SH 130) in
Caldwell County, Texas. Specifically, U. S. Highway 183 (Hwy 183) will be expanded for the new SH
130 project. In order to accommodate the Hwy. 183 expansion, LCRA will be removing three existing
structures on the east side of Hwy. 183, and adding two new structures on either side of Hwy. 183. On
the T-185/246 transmission line, LCRA will remove existing structure #112 on the east side of Hwy. 183
and construct two new 345 kV tangent lattice steel towers on either side of Hwy. 183.
A file search showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites in any of the areas
where LCRA proposes to remove existing transmission structures and construct new structures. The file
search also indicated that TxDOT archaeologists have recently conducted a cultural resource survey of the
proposed SH 130 corridor in areas adjacent to LCRA’s proposed relocation work. No cultural resource
sites were found by TxDOT archaeologists in any areas adjacent to LCRA’s proposed relocation work.
Review of topographic maps suggests low probabilities for any unrecorded prehistoric archaeological
sites in LCRA’s work areas on the T-382 and T-185-246 lines. To gauge the potential for unrecorded
historic period sites, historic maps consisting of the 1896 Austin, Texas 30’ USGS map, the 1906 San
Marcos, Texas 15’ USGS map, and the 1955 Montopolis, Texas 15’ USGS map were examined to
determine if there were ever any historic house sites or farmsteads in any of the areas of LCRA’s
proposed transmission relocation work areas. Since no such potential historic sites were found on the
maps, the LCRA work areas are rated as having low probabilities for historic period sites.
Based on the results of the file search, a field survey investigation does not appear to be warranted. The
LCRA Archaeology Services staff recommends that the proposed T-382 and T-185/246 relocation work
be allowed to proceed as currently planned. Because of the small sizes of the project areas on these two
relocations, a letter does not need to be sent to the Texas Historical Commission for review and
concurrence. Instead, the project manager may use this memo as authorization for the work to proceed.
The LCRA Archaeology Services staff will report the results of the file search at a later date in the
LCRA’s Annual Report of Cultural Resource Investigations for Calendar Year 2009.

Project 67.09 T-539 transmission line maintenance
(Figure 205)
County(s):

Gonzales

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

December 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Archaeology Services staff has completed a cultural
resources desktop review for the proposed FY10 maintenance work on Transmission Line T-539. This
transmission line extends for a distance of 2.1 miles from the AEP Nixon Substation to the LCRA Nixon
Substation, Texas.
A file search showed that the only portion of the T-539 right-of-way (ROW) corridor that has been
previously surveyed for cultural resource sites is a small area in the north-central part of the corridor
where the line intersects with T-425. Importantly, at the intersection of these two transmission lines, a
prehistoric lithic scatter designated as 41GZ204 was recorded and assessed for the proposed rebuilding of
a portion of T-425 (Nash and Taylor 1995). Site 41GZ204 was described as a very sparse scatter of chert
and quartzite flakes that was located within a plowed field. Shovel testing indicated that no buried
artifacts were present, and the site was assessed as not eligible for formal designation as a State
Archeological Landmark. No further investigation of site 41GZ204 is recommended for the current T539 maintenance project.
Aside from 41GZ204, a review of topographic maps suggests that is one area of concern where
unrecorded archaeological sites could be impacted by maintenance work. That area extends from about
170 feet northeast of STR #188A to the location of STR #188B. Within this area ground disturbance
should be minimized. In particular, there should be no modifications to existing creek banks, and any
vegetation clearing (especially tree removal) should be done without root disturbance (i. e. no
bulldozing). If this area cannot be avoided, Archaeology Services should be contacted at ext. 6714 two
weeks prior to the proposed disturbance so that a field assessment can be conducted. If the assessment
indicates that potentially significant archaeological sites are present, then additional testing and/or
mitigation may be necessary prior to disturbance.
Aside from the special conditions relating to the one area described above, the proposed maintenance
work on the T-539 line may proceed. However, standard emergency discovery provisions are always
applicable. Should the personnel conducting the work uncover any presently unknown buried
archaeological materials during construction, then work should cease in the immediate area of the
discovery and the LCRA Archaeology Services staff should be contacted.

Project 68.09 Brush clearing at Canyon of the Eagles Park
(Figure 206)
County(s):

Burnet

Type of Investigation:

Field survey

Date of Investigation:

December 2009

The LCRA plans to clear brush in four areas of their Canyon of the Eagles Park on Lake Buchanan in
Burnet County. For the project, these areas have been designated Area 1 through Area 4 and are all
located in the southern half of the park. A file search by Archeology Services staff found that two
archeological sites, 41BT295 and 41BT307, were previously recorded in this part of the park during the
1996 cultural resource survey conducted prior to development.
Site 41BT307 was recorded in Area 4 and identified as a prehistoric scatter of flint chipping debris with at
least one tool, a scraper. The site does not meet the criteria for State Archeological Landmark (SAL)
designation and therefore no special precautions are needed during the current brush clearing project. Site
41BT307, located below the 1020 ft shoreline in Area 1, was originally recorded as a prehistoric campsite
with partially buried hearths. Limited shovel testing failed to find – or rule out – buried cultural deposits.
Further testing was recommended to determine the site’s eligibility for SAL designation.
To determine if buried cultural deposits are present at 41BT307, Archeology Services staff revisited the
site on December 23, 2009 to do further shovel testing. The site area was relocated with the help of the
description in the original survey report. As recorded, the site is contained within a narrow, bench-like
formation immediately below the 1020 ft contour between a rocky ridge and the inlet to the west.
During the present survey, no obvious cultural material was seen on the surface of the 41BT307 site area.
A road, not mentioned in the original survey report, runs along the east side of the site area adjacent to
(and cut partially into) the rocky ridge. This road terminates at its south end at a concrete causeway
running out into the inlet. Most of site area is presently covered by a scatter of rocks, either talus from the
slope or rocks dislodged by road construction. Only loose redeposited sand appears to be present on the
bench which was confirmed by a shovel test which encountered bands of sand and driftwood over
bedrock.
The hearths recorded in 1996 are no longer visible and have either been covered by wave-deposited sand
or completely dispersed. In any case no intact soil is present within the site area and the site is probably
not eligible for SAL designation. Therefore, no special precautions are necessary at 41BT307 during the
upcoming brush clearing project.

(Figure 207)
County(s):

Type of Investigation:

File Search

Date of Investigation:

July 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority’s (LCRA) Transmission Services staff is proposing to upgrade the
western end of the T-197/325 transmission line which is located in Travis County, Texas. The five
structures at the western end of the transmission line will be replaced with new structures. Each
replacement structure will be erected within 20 feet of the existing structure. Some brush clearing will
also be completed in the areas around and between these five structures while the crews are in the field.
Additionally, the project will involve upgrading the 138 kV operating bus in the Marshall Ford upper yard
substation from 220 MVA to 706 MVA.
A files searched conducted by the LCRA Archaeology Services staff showed this portion of the T197/325 transmission line was previously surveyed for cultural resource sites by Prewitt and Associates,
Inc. (PA&I) in 1980 during a survey of LCRA’s TN-1 and TN-2 tracts. No significant or potentially
significant cultural resource sites were found during that investigation. The Texas Historical Commission
concurred with the results of the PA&I survey. Because the proposed work within the Marshall Ford
substation will occur within a previously disturbed area that is unlikely to contain any remaining intact
cultural resources, the equipment upgrade work there may proceed.
Based on the results of on the results of PA&I’s previous investigation and the previous disturbance
within the Marshall Ford Substation Upper Yard, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff recommends that
the proposed T-197/325 upgrade proceed, as currently planned. As always, standard emergency
discovery provisions are applicable to this project. Should the construction personnel uncover any
presently unknown buried archeological features during construction work, then work should cease in the
immediate area of the discovery and the LCRA Archeology Services staff should be notified.

Part 3. Letters to THC Requesting Clearance through File Searches
In 11 cases letters were sent to THC. Ten of these made the statement that LCRA felt no survey was
necessary. In all these instances THC agreed. One letter reported the results of post-construction
monitoring, and recommended that any future impacts to site 41TV1051 would no longer be subject to
review, once adjacent TxDOT investigations were completed and assuming the landowner (the City of
Austin) was in agreement.

Project 4.09 Divide to Twin Buttes transmission line addition
(Figure 208)
County(s):

Tom Green, Coke

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

February 2009

The LCRA is proposing to add an electrical wire to the existing transmission pole structures on the 30.62
mile long segment of LCRA T-422 transmission line that extends from the Twin Buttes Substation in
Tom Green County to the Divide Substation in Coke County. The transmission line corridor involved in
this project is highlighted in orange on the attached topographic maps. No construction of new or
additional pole structures will be required, nor will the transmission line right-of-way need to be widened
to accommodate the additional circuit wire. The only impact will be vehicular traffic of the bucket-trucks
used in traveling the right-of-way to attach the additional circuit wires to the pole structures.
The existing T-422 transmission line corridor was surveyed for cultural resource sites by PBS&J in 2002
as Segment A of the large LCRA Morgan Creek to Comanche transmission line project. The PBS&J
archaeologists recorded four archaeological sites within the transmission line ROW that constitutes the
current project area. These sites, which are shown in red on the attached maps, consist of 41CK218,
41TG561, 41TG565, 41TG564.
Detailed descriptions of these sites are found in PBS&J Document No 020173 which is titled
Management Summary of the Cultural Resource Survey for the Morgan Creek – Comanche 345-kV
Transmission Line Project Segment A, Coke, Sterling, and Tom Green Counties, Texas, by C. R. Shortes,
C. Sills, and C. McMurtrie. This report was reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission under TAC
Permit No. 2795.
PBS&J assessed sites 41CK218, 41TG561, and 41TG564 as insignificant, while site 41TG565 was
assessed as potentially significant. Because of its potential significance, PBS&J recommended hand
clearing of vegetation within the boundaries of site 41TG565 to minimize any impacts to the site during
construction. The Texas Historical Commission concurred with PBS&J’s assessments and
recommendations for the four sites.
Given the nature of the current project, hand clearing of any new vegetation that has grown up within the
transmission line right-of-way inside the boundaries of 41TG565 is again recommended to minimize
impacts to this potentially significant site. The LCRA recommends that the stringing of the new wire in
all other parts of the transmission line corridor be allowed to proceed without any restrictions.

Date of Investigation:

February 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to add an electrical wire to the existing
transmission pole structures on a 93.6 mile long section of the LCRA’s transmission line system in Tom
Green, Concho, McCulloch, and Coleman counties, Texas. The western part of this transmission line
section is LCRA’s T-423 line, which extends from the Twin Buttes Substation to the Red Creek
Substation. The eastern part is LCRA’s T-424 line, which extends from the Red Creek Substation to the
Coleman/Brown county line. The transmission line corridors involved in this project are shown on the
attached topographic maps. No construction of new or additional pole structures will be required, nor will
the transmission line right-of-way need to be widened to accommodate the additional circuit wire. The
only impact will be vehicular traffic of the bucket-trucks used in traveling the right-of-way (ROW)
corridor to attach the additional circuit wires to the pole structures.
The existing T-423 transmission line corridor was surveyed for cultural resource sites by PBS&J in 2000
and 2002 as Segment B of the large LCRA Morgan Creek to Comanche transmission line project. The
PBS&J archaeologists recorded seven archaeological sites within the T-423 transmission line ROW.
These sites, which are shown in red on the Attachment 1 maps, consist of 41TG536-538, and 41TG557560.
Detailed descriptions of sites 41TG536-538 are found in PBS&J Document No 991485 which is titled
Environmental Information for the Proposed 34- kV Transmission Line Easement Across U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers Property Near O.C. Fisher Lake, Tom Green County, Texas. PBS&J assessed the
portions sites 41TG536-538 within the transmission line ROW as insignificant prehistoric lithic
scatter/procurement sites that are not National Register (NR) or State Archeological Landmark (SAL)
eligible. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concurred with
PBS&J’s assessments and recommendations for these three sites.
The remainder of Segment B of the Morgan Creek to Comanche Transmission Line was reported by
PBS&J Document No. 020124 which is titled Management Summary of the Cultural Resources Survey
for the Morgan Creek-Comanche 345-kV Transmission Line Project, Segment B, Tom Green County,
Texas. In that report PBS&J assessed the portions of sites 41TG557-560 within the transmission line
ROW as not NR or SAL eligible. The THC concurred with PBS&J’s assessments for these sites on May
31, 2002.
The existing T-424 transmission line was surveyed for cultural resource sites by PBS&J in 2001 as
Segment C of the LCRA Morgan Creek to Comanche Transmission Project. PBS&J recorded 29
archaeological sites on Segment C and reported that work in PBS&J document 010259, which is entitled
Cultural Resource Survey of the Morgan Creek to Comanche 345-kV Transmission Line Project ,Segment
C, Coleman, Concho, McCulloch, and Tom Green Counties, Texas. These 29 sites consist of 41TG312,
41TG548-551, 41TG553-556, 41CC191, 41CC299-309, 41CN273-277, 41CN279-281, and 41MK43.
The locations of these sites are shown in red on the Attachment 2 maps. The portions of these sites within
the transmission line ROW were all assessed by PBS&J as insignificant, and the THC concurred with
these assessments on September 4, 2001.

415

Given the results of the previous cultural resource investigations and the absence of any grounddisturbing activities associated with the current project, the LCRA recommends that the stringing of the
new wire in all parts of the transmission line corridor be allowed to proceed without any restrictions or
further cultural resource investigations.

Project 9.09 Kendall Substation upgrade
(Figure 210)
County(s):

Kendall

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

February 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to upgrade its existing 40-acre Kendall
Substation property. The LCRA’s Kendall Substation and the Central Texas Electric Co-op’s Kendall
Substation currently occupy about 12 acres within the 40-acre tract (Figure 1). Other existing facilities
within the tract include an access road, a water detention pond, and a formerly cleared equipment
laydown area.
The purpose of the proposed substation upgrade is to provide an interconnection with a wind generation
facility. Work within the 40 acre tract for the proposed upgrade will include cutting out about 5 acres of a
limestone hillslope located north of the existing LCRA Kendall Substation to bring that area to the same
grade as the substation (see Figure 1). The fill material from cutting into the limestone hill slope will be
placed within the 4-acre detention pond area located between the two existing substations. Other
elements associated with the project include relocating a number of transmission pole structures within
the grounds of the 40-acre tract. Additionally, an approximately 500 foot long rerouting of the existing T120 transmission line will extend from the northwest corner of LCRA’s tract northward onto a private
property. This 500 foot long stretch of the T-120 transmission line will have a 100 foot wide right-of-way
corridor.
A file search conducted by the LCRA Archaeology Services staff for the substation upgrade project
showed that a cultural resource assessment of the entire 40-acre owned LCRA tract was conducted by
Lone Star Archaeological Services (LSAS) prior to the construction of the two existing substations in
1982. The LSAS staff found three archaeological sites within the survey area. These sites consist of two
prehistoric lithic scatters, 41KE80 and 41KE81, and one prehistoric lithic scatter/quarry, 41KE82. All
sites were found to have widely scattered lithic materials in eroded and disturbed contexts. LSAS
assessed all three sites as insignificant and not eligible for formal designation as State Archeological
Landmarks. The Texas Historical Commission concurred with these assessments and allowed
construction to proceed without any further investigations.
The only currently proposed project element not covered in the area previously surveyed by LSAS is
proposed 500 foot long rerouting of the T-120 transmission line corridor north of the LCRA tract. That
area is located in an upland ridgetop and is not close to the boundaries of any of sites previously recorded
by LSAS. Given the high upland location of this portion of the project, it is assessed as having a low
probability for any significant cultural resource sites. A field investigation does not appear to be
warranted for the transmission line relocation nor for the larger area previously surveyed by LSAS. The
LCRA recommends that all of the construction associated with the substation upgrade project be allowed
to proceed.

transmission line (T-420)
(Figure 211)
County(s):

Travis

Type of Investigation:

Monitoring

Date of Investigation:

April 2009

On August 7, 2006, the Texas Historical Commission concurred with cultural resource recommendations
for the then-proposed Manchaca to Escarpment transmission line project. The project was allowed to
proceed with the understanding that a set of low, linear rock features associated with historic site
41TV1051, would be avoided. Site 41TV1051 is a homestead located primarily within future SH 45
ROW owned by TxDOT. In 2006, TxDOT was still trying to determine if the homestead was eligible for
the National Register of Historic Places. The stone features within the LCRA easement (which is owned
by the City of Austin) were therefore considered contributing members to a site potentially eligible for
formal National Register listing and therefore also potentially eligible for listing as a formal State
Archeological landmark. It was recommended that the features within the LCRA ROW be avoided by
construction impacts as long as eligibility status remained unclear or undetermined.
In the spring of 2008 LCRA Archaeology Services was notified that construction was imminent.
Archaeology Services staff accompanied by construction project managers and engineers visited the site,
which was then flagged with caution tape. Surveyors also included the boundaries within plan and profile
maps they were producing. Clearing was accomplished by large shears. Trees were lifted out of the site
area and disposed of elsewhere. Construction of the transmission line was completed in March of 2009.
On April 8, 2009, I visited the portion of site 41TV1051 that is located within the ROW of T-420. I was
accompanied by LCRA project manager Jon Robertson. Upon arrival I found the flagging I had put up
along the avoidance areas was still present, and that additional fencing had been added around sections
that were within the main part of the ROW. No impacts were noted. These features were photographed
(Figure 212, Figure 213, Figure 214, Figure 215, Figure 216, Figure 217).
A following conversation with John Budd of TxDOT and Doug Boyd of Prewitt and Associates (PAI)
confirmed that the TxDOT portion of the site has been determined to be eligible for the National Register
of Historic Places. PAI is in the process of doing data recovery on what was determined to be the
Ransom Williams homestead. This apparently ties in with the Antioch Freedman’s Colony which is
about 10 miles away. Following mitigation the site will be destroyed by SH45. PAI will almost certainly
include instrument mapping of the features on LCRA ROW. Whether or not this is actually done, once
the highway is constructed, the rock features within LCRA ROW will be contributing to a nonexistent
site.
It is therefore recommended that any future transmission line work no longer be required to consider the
archaeological significance of the site, once PAI has completed mitigation. However, the City of Austin
will still own these features, so any potential impacts would still need to be coordinated through the
appropriate city agency.

(Figure 217)
County(s):

Type of Investigation:

File search, reconnaissance

Date of Investigation:

May 2009

The LCRA Transmission Services Corporation is proposing to move segments of the existing rights-ofway (ROWs) of its T-359 Transmission Line between the Gabriel and Glasscock Substations and T-413
Line between the Glasscock and Andice Substations in Williamson County (Figures 1 and 2). These
relocations are needed to accommodate a planned widening of State Highway 195 by the Texas
Department of Transportation. The movements of segments of these transmission line ROWs will, in
some cases, involve relocations into completely new ROW areas and in other instances will involve
partially movement of the ROWs into new areas.
The T-359 Line will run eastwards from the Glasscock Substation in a new ROW corridor positioned
adjacent to the north side of the existing ROW and then over the next 1000 feet will angle southeastwards
to completely merge back into the existing ROW (Figure 1). Structures #45 and #46 will have to be
moved northwards but will probably remain in the original ROW. One hundred feet south of Structure
#30 on T-359, the new corridor will begin to angle to the east away from the existing ROW but will still
mostly overlap for a distance of 3700 feet before it completely merges back into the existing ROW
(Figure 2). The structures along this segment (#26 through #29) will remain in the existing ROW.
Structure #35 may be moved to the north slightly but with also remain in the existing ROW.
Beginning immediately west of the Glasscock Substation, the T-413 ROW will be moved 250 feet to the
north of the existing ROW for a length of 6200 feet west of the Glasscock Substation (Figure 1). It will
then veer off to the north at an angle of 10 degrees for an additional 2300 feet at which point it will take a
near 90 degree turn southwards and continue in a southwesterly direction for 540 feet back into its
existing ROW. From this point westwards to the Andice Substation, the existing T-413 ROW will remain
unchanged. The new ROW corridor will be 80 feet wide. Existing transmission pole structures #2
through #15 will be relocated to the new ROW. Within the portion of the existing ROW that will remain
in place, Structures #18 and #19 will be relocated or raised for a new road and Structures #22 through #24
may also have to be raised or otherwise changed.
The existing T-359 ROW was surveyed by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc in 1997 and the T-413 ROW
by Horizon Environmental Services (HES) in 2005. These surveys found no archeological sites in ROW
areas where existing transmission pole structures will be moved or changed in the current project. An
earlier routing of T-413 happens to follow part of the new ROW (see Figure 1). That route was included
in the original HES survey with no sites being recorded in that earlier route.
The areas in the current project that have not been surveyed for cultural resources are as follows: the 540
foot long segment of new T-413 ROW that enters the existing corridor between existing Structures #14
and #15; the 6200 foot long segment of new T-413 ROW west of the Glasscock Substation; the 1000 foot
long section of new T-359 ROW from the Glasscock Substation running east and overlapping the existing
ROW; and the 3700 foot long section of new T-359 ROW south of Structure #30 that also will also
overlap the existing corridor. A file search showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource
sites in any of these areas. As can be seen from the Figures 1 and 2 topographic maps, the new ROWs are

425

located in uplands far from creeks and other water sources. Thus, these areas are assessed as having a
low probability for prehistoric sites.
To assess the potential for unrecorded historic period sites, the earliest USGS topographic maps showing
individual house structures in the project area were examined. Only one house structure was found to be
located in the vicinity of any of the transmission ROW reroute sections. This house structure is shown
on the 1925 Round Rock, Texas 15’ USGS map and the 1982 Georgetown, Texas 7.5 USGS map as
being located just north the new ROW about 210 meters southeast of the Glasscock Substation. To
determine if this cultural resource site lay within the transmission line ROW and, if so, to help plan for an
intensive cultural resource survey, the LCRA Archeology Services staff conducted a reconnaissance of
that area in late May 2009. During the reconnaissance, ground surface visibility was found to be very
good due to shallow topsoils and frequent exposures of limestone bedrock on ground surface. No
archaeological materials were observed on ground surface within the ROW at that location or within 100
meters further up and down the transmission line ROW. Additionally, several shovel probes were
excavated in the reconnaissance area at spots having topsoil. No artifacts were found in the probes and
the average depth of topsoil was found to be only 10 to 15 cm. LCRA Archaeology Services staff
concluded that any historic archaeological remains must lay further northeastward outside of the ROW.
Based on the results of the file search and the negative results of the brief field reconnaissance of the one
area having some potential for a historic site, it does not appear that a full-scale intensive cultural resource
survey is needed. The LCRA staff concludes that the proposed transmission line relocation project will
not affect any cultural resource sites that may be eligible for formal designation as State Archeological
Landmarks.

Project 24.09 Buchanan floodgate project, Phase 2
(Figure 218)

County(s):

Burnet

Type of Investigation:

File Search, recommendation of “No Effect”

Date of Investigation:

July 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to conduct maintenance work on all of the 37
floodgates at Buchanan Dam in Burnet County, Texas. The 37 floodgates are divided into three sections
– the 7 Gate Section, the 14 Gate Section, and the 16 Gate Section. A recent structural analysis of the
gates indicated that they are under designed based on current codes, and could theoretically be damaged
or fail if they were overtopped and subjected to lake levels above 1022 feet (ft) mean sea level (msl)
during a localized, intense rain storm event. The proposed floodgate improvement project will be
conducted in phases over a 12-year period beginning in 2009.
The current review involves the first step in this phased process. As the initial step, the LCRA proposes
to extend the existing concrete nose piers outward approximately 6 to 12 inches at each of the 37
floodgates (Figure 219, Figure 220). The new concrete pier extensions will provide workable surfaces to
anchor stop logs which would act as small cofferdams to dewater individual gates for additional testing
and repairs, as needed. The testing and repairs may eventually lead to automating and refurbishing 6
existing hoists, and the eventual addition of 26 new automated hoists on the small floodgates of the 14gate and 16-gate spillways to handle the Probable Maximum Precipitation Event. Additionally, the
testing and repairs would include the removal, inspection, and replacement of the gate trunnions, if
needed, on a gate-by-gate basis.
The additions to the pier noses would extend from the front side of dam at an elevation of approximately
1001 ft msl upward to a height of 1022 ft msl. Because of the current drought conditions, the water level
at Lake Buchanan has dropped from the normal conservation pool level of 1020 feet msl to 1000.2 ft msl
exposing the the front sides of the floodgates and their associated nose piers. Since the drought
conditions are expected to continue, it appears that the work involving the extension of the nose piers
could be accomplished in the coming months.
The construction of the nose pier extensions will constitute the equivalent of placing about 10 cubic yards
fill material into the normal lake bed at the locations of each of the 40 nose piers. As a result, it is
expected that a U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Nationwide #3 Permit will be required. The federal
permitting procedure will include a cultural resource review under Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966.
A review of LCRA’s Buchanan Dam file showed that in March 2007, Buchanan Dam was determined
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places under Criteria A and C by the Texas State
Historic Preservation Officer and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers during a cultural resource review of
a previous LCRA floodgate maintenance project. A “No Adverse Effect” determination was issued for
that project. The LCRA now requests the THC’s comments of the effects to the historic integrity of the
dam posed by the currently proposed floodgate maintenance project.
The LCRA also conducted a file search to determine if any previously recorded archaeological sites are
present in the areas where the nose piers will be extended. The file search showed that portions of the
Lake Buchanan project area were surveyed for cultural resources in 1937 by A. T. Jackson with 74 sites

428

429

being recorded. By that point in time, construction of Buchanan Dam was proceeding, and it does not
appear that Jackson investigated the dam construction area. However, considering the massive earthdisturbing activities associated with the construction, it is doubtful that any existing archaeological sites
escaped total destruction. Furthermore, the floodgates are situated at distances from 400 to 1,700 meters
from the main Colorado River channel in upland areas where deep, stratified archaeological sites would
not be expected. Given these factors, it does not appear that an archaeological survey is warranted, since
it is unlikely that any archaeological sites that are eligible for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places or meriting formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks could still be present.
On July 23, 2009, a finding of No Adverse Effect was received from the Texas Historical Commission.

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

August 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to lease a 39.24 acre tract approximately 1.75
miles south of the Llano, Texas for use as an equipment laydown area for the upcoming Gillespie to
Newton Transmission Line Project (see map attachment). Use of the tract may require some minor brush
clearing and construction of a temporary access road through the property. Otherwise, the only impacts
will involve laying of materials on the ground surface.
The LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted a file search for the project. The file search showed
that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within the proposed lease area. The file
search also indicated that the acreage has not ever been surveyed by a professional archaeologist. The
project area is located in a high, upland area and the closest creek channel of any size is Oatman Creek,
which is situated about 550 meters east of the project area’s east boundary. The LCRA Archaeology
Services staff assesses the project area as having a low probability for any prehistoric sites.
To assess the potential for any historic sites, the 1909 Llano, Texas 30’ USGS map and the modern 1960
Llano South, Texas 7.5’ USGS map were examined to determine if any house structures are shown within
the project area. The 1909 Llano topo map appears to be very detailed, and it has been used successfully
on past projects to predict the locations of historic farmstead sites. Neither of these maps indicated that
there were houses within the project area.
Based on the results of the file search, the LCRA Archaeology Services staff does not feel that an
intensive cultural resource survey is needed. Staff recommends that the proposed use of the tract as an
equipment laydown area be allowed to proceed with the understanding that standard emergency discovery
procedures are applicable.

August 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to lease a 25 acre tract that is located
approximately 2.5 miles southeast of Comfort, Texas for use as an equipment laydown area for the
upcoming Gillespie to Newton Transmission Line Project (see map attachment). This land tract has been
previously disturbed by its long-time, previous usage as an equipment laydown area by a private electrical
utility company.
The LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted a file search for the project. The file search showed
that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within the proposed lease area. The file
search also indicated that the acreage has not ever been surveyed by a professional archaeologist. The
1930 Comfort, Texas 30’ USGS map and the modern Waring, Texas 7.5’ USGS map were also examined
to determine if any historic house structures could be present within the land tract. Neither of these maps
indicated that there were houses within the project area.
Based on the results of the file search and the fact that the land tract has been previously disturbed by the
same type of activities that LCRA will be undertaking on the property, the LCRA Archaeology Services
staff does not feel that an intensive cultural resource survey is needed. Staff recommends that the
proposed use of the tract as an LCRA equipment laydown area be allowed to proceed with the
understanding that standard emergency discovery procedures are applicable.

Type of Investigation:

File search

Date of Investigation:

September 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to upgrade its existing T-421 electrical
transmission line which extends from LCRA’s Gilleland Creek Substation to the ONCOR Elgin
Substation. The T-421 transmission line runs through portions of Bastrop, Travis, and Williamson
counties, Texas and it has a total length of 12.9 miles (see map attachment). The principal grounddisturbing activity associated with the upgrade project will involve the replacement of 7 of the existing
114 wood H-frame transmission pole structures and both dead end lattice towers with new structures and
towers. Where the H-frame pole structures and lattice towers are replaced, the new ones will be placed
within 10 feet of the existing ones. The crossarms, knee braces, and X-braces on some of the other
existing H-frame structures will also be replaced or repaired, and the conductor wires on all of the
structures will be upgraded. These activities will require vehicular traffic within the transmission line
ROW but should not cause any damage to subsurface soil deposits. Other activities associated with this
project will include upgrade of some equipment within the existing LCRA Gilleland Creek Substation.
The LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted a file search as an initial step in the project review. The
file search showed that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within the project area.
The file search also indicated that the Gilleland Creek Substation had been surveyed by the LCRA
Archaeology Services staff prior to its construction with negative results. The transmission line ROW,
however, was not surveyed prior to its original construction because that construction predated the
enactment of the State Antiquities Code.
The transmission line corridor is located in Blackland Prairie uplands in areas where most of the land has
been under intense cultivation for the past 100 years. This plowing along with activities associated with
the original construction of the transmission line has damaged the upper topsoil deposits in most parts of
the project area. Inspection of the geologic atlas map containing the project area indicated that there is no
Holocene-era alluvium along the flanks of any of the creeks where they are crossed by the transmission
line corridor. Overall, it appears that any prehistoric sites within the project area lay on or near ground
surface in areas probably previously disturbed. The map review also indicated that Willbarger Creek is
the only large creek that will be crossed by the transmission line where unmapped Holocene alluvium
might be expected. However, none of the transmission structures adjacent to Willbarger Creek are slated
for replacement. Based on the facts listed above, it appeared that the proposed project had a low
probability to impact any undisturbed prehistoric sites that might be eligible or potentially eligible for
formal State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation.
To assess the potential for historic period sites at the locations of transmission structure replacements,
various old topographic maps including the Austin, Texas 1910 and the Bastrop, Texas 1904 30’ USGS
maps, the Elgin, Texas 1948 7.5’USGS map and other modern topographic maps were examined to
determine if any former or present-day houses and farmsteads coincide with those locations. The review
showed no such house or farmstead sites in areas where replacement work will occur. Thus, the
proposed project is assessed as also having a low probability of affecting any historic period
archaeological sites that may be eligible or potentially eligible for formal SAL listing.

435

Based on the results of the file search, the LCRA does not feel that a field survey is needed for this
project. The LCRA recommends that the proposed project be allowed to proceed with the
understanding that standard emergency discovery provisions are applicable.

Date of Investigation:

October 2009

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) is proposing to lease a 30 acre tract that is located about
4.5 miles south of Lampasas, Texas for use as an equipment laydown area for the upcoming Competitive
Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ) transmission line construction projects. The tract is situated
immediately west of U. S. Highway 281 in northern Burnet County, and it is bisected by LCRA’s existing
T-219 transmission line (see map attachment). The LCRA’s proposed usage of the tract will involve
storage of metal poles, conductor wire, and other equipment to be used for the erection of new electrical
transmission poles and wires. The laying of the equipment within the tract has the potential to disturb the
ground surface and possibly the upper 20 cm of any topsoils that may be present.
The LCRA Archaeology Services staff conducted a file search for the project. The file search showed
that there are no previously recorded cultural resource sites within the proposed lease area. The file
search also indicated that a cultural resource survey of high probability areas along the T-219
transmission line corridor was conducted by LCRA staff in 2004 in association with upcoming
maintenance work on the line. However, the portion of the transmission line within the current project
area was not field investigated during that survey because it was considered to have a low probability for
cultural resource sites.
The proposed lease area is located in an upland area, and the only stream channel within the tract is the
upstream end of very minor unnamed tributary of Sulphur Creek that is situated in the far northwest
corner of the tract. Review of the topography and the stream channel location suggests that the project
area has a low probability for any unrecorded prehistoric sites. Examination of the 1885 Lampasas, Texas
30’ USGS map and more recent USGS maps did not show any historic house sites or other features
within the project area. Therefore, the project area is also assessed as having a low probability for any
historic period sites. Given these facts, it does not appear that any unknown State Archeological
Landmark eligible or potential eligible sites could be present within the tract. The LCRA recommends
that the proposed project be allowed to proceed without a formal field survey. As always, standard
emergency discovery provisions are applicable.

On August 12, 2009, your office concurred with recommendations in LCRA Interim Report #6.09,
Intensive Cultural Resources Investigation of the LCRA’s Transmission Services Corporation Proposed
North McCamey to McCamey B (Tippet) Transmission Line Rebuild and Substation Construction Project
Upton, Crockett and Pecos Counties, Texas. The project was primarily the construction of a new
substation located a few miles south of McCamey near the Pecos River. One previously unrecorded
archaeological site, 41PC670 was documented. This highly disturbed lithic scatter with burned rock was
considered ineligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark.
The original substation design called for access along the existing transmission line right-of-way (ROW).
Project personnel have determined that a alternate access road is preferable (Figure 1). The new
substation access will use an existing ranch/oilfield road that joins Hwy 305 about 0.2 miles north of the
transmission line. It runs generally west then south for a total of about 0.3 miles before joining the
transmission line, which the route will follow the remainder of the way into the substation. The existing
road will require some grading and possibly some widening.
Because this is an existing road through areas disturbed by ranching and oilfield activities, and given that
the previous survey(s) found no evidence of archaeological sites within the general setting, LCRA
Archaeology Services feels that no additional survey is necessary for this proposed new access road.

Date of Investigation:

November 2009

LCRA Transmission Services Corporation (TSC) proposes to bring in a section of existing transmission
line T-153 to a new substation that will be owned by the Bluebonnet Electric Coop (BBEC) at the
Tahitian Village Subdivision just outside the town of Bastrop in Bastrop County, Texas (Figure 1). The
new substation will be called the Tahitian Village Substation.
The LCRA-owned portion of the project will involve placing two “A-frame” structures along with
switches, metering devices and controls. The total area that will be covered by these devices will be
about 0.25 acres.
A cultural resources assessment of the project was conducted on November 4, 2009, and consisted of a
file search and map review. The project area is within the Calvert Bluff formation of the Eocene Wilcox
formation, consisting primarily of mudstone and sandstone. Soils are mapped as Edge series (probably
reclassified from Axtell series) soils that are described as about 8 inches in depth over an eluviated
horizon resting on clays. Topographically, the project area is on the side slopes of an upland ridge system
that overlooks the Colorado River floodplain. According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, no
cultural resource sites have been recorded in similar settings within the vicinity of the project area. Sites
in the general area are either fully in the uplands or on the floodplain.
Given the sloping topography, shallow soils and non-chert-bearing geology of the project area, LCRA
Archaeology Services staff feels this project has a very low probability of impacting any intact cultural
resource sites, and that a cultural resources survey is not necessary.
