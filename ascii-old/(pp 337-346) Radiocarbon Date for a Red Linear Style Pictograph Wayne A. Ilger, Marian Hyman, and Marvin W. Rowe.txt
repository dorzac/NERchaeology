Radiocarbon Date for a Red Linear Style Pictograph
Wayne A. llger, Marian Hyman, and Marvin W. Rowe

ABSTRACT
The age of Red Linear pictographs in the Lower Pecos River region
of Texas is not yet well defined. Here we report the first radiocarbon
date on a sample of this pictograph style using an oxygen plasma
extraction technique and accelerator mass spectrometry. The sample,
taken from site 41VV162A, dates to 1280 -+ 45 years B.P. The background organic carbon in an unpainted rock sample taken near the
pictograph indicated that 9 percent of the sample carbon may be contamination. This increases the standard deviation to + 135 years B.P. As
always with a single radiocarbon date, caution is advised pending further studies.

INTRODUCTION
One of the five recommendations suggested by Dibble and Prewitt
(1967:12 !) for further study of rockshelters in the Lower Pecos River region of
Texas was the need to obtain absolute ages of the various styles of pictographs
often found on the shelter walls: "These [pictographs] represent one of the most
outstanding features of Amistad archeology but, as yet, remain undated by
archeological evidence." This has been our focus. Since 1990, it has been possible to directly date pictographs by analysis of the radiocarbon content of the
organic matter used to make the paint (Russ et al. 1990:710-713).
Pictographs painted before the arrival of the Spanish in the Lower Pecos are
generally divided into four styles: the polychrome Pecos River style, five samples
of which were radiocarbon dated between 3,000-4,200 years B.P. (Russ et al.
1990:710; Russ et al. 1992:87!; Chaffee et al. 1993:70); the polychrome Bold
Line Geometric style, more recent than the Pecos River style, but which is
otherwise not well placed in time (Turpin 1986b: 159); the Red Linear style, with
an age range not yet satisfactorily established (Grieder 1966:715; Turpin
1984:195); and the Red Monochrome style, where figures are sometimes shown
with bows and arrows, suggesting they date from approximately A.D. 600 to 700
to historic times (Kelley 1950:72; Turpin 1986a: 124). We present here the first
direct radiocarbon date on a Red Linear style pictograph.

The pictograph sampled is at Cueva Quebrada (41VV162A). Cueva
Quebrada lies about two miles north of the confluence of the Rio Grande and
Pecos Rivers. It is situated high on the north wall of a small dry canyon near
the rimrock (Lundelius 1984:457-458). Only three radiocarbon dates had previously been obtained from this shelter, all three on wood charcoal associated with
extinct fauna (Valastro et al. 1977:309). The three dates are: 14,300, 13,920,
and 12,280 years B.P. None are of value in interpreting the dates of the pictographs at this site, however.
Two styles of pictographs are represented at Cueva Quebrada. Red Linear
style images overlie several faded Pecos River style pictographs. The ~brmer
are miniature stick figures ranging in color from red to orange red. These Red
Linear images include a dog, a number of human-like figures, and 17 depictions that Grieder (1966:715) interpreted as running animals, perhaps deer or
bison. Turpin (1984:186, 188, 193, 196 and Figure 7) further interpreted the
scene as bison being herded towards a precipice, as represented by a crack in
the surface of the wall. If this interpretation is correct, the image represents jump
hunting: bison were run off the edge of a cliff, killed either by the fall or the
hunters, then butchered where they fell.
Archeological evidence for this type of hunt is found in the Lower Pecos
region at Bonfire Shelter (41VV218) (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). There the
animals fell about 23 m to the floor of the shelter. The upper bison bone bed
was radiocarbon dated with associated scorched bone to 2310 + 210 and 2810
+ 110 years B.P. (Tamers et al. 1964:153-154) and with charcoal dates of 2780
+ 110 (Tamers et al. 1964:154) and 2510 + 110 years B.P. (Pearson et a!.
1965:304). Further evidence of bison presence in the Lower Pecos River region
is scarce. However, some bison bones were reported from Eagle Cave (Raun
1966:213) and Arenosa Shelter (Collins 1976:!11). Alexander (1974:27-28)
stated that:
Absence of bison bone may not indicate absence of bison hunting,
however. There are indications in the ethnohistoric data from the general region of northern Mexico and southwestern Texas that Indian
groups may have traveled some distance north of their usual territories
in order to hunt bison, bringing back with them only the dried meat
(e.g., Bolton 1916:296-297). If this were true of the Amistad Archaic,
then their subsistence system would include an item which goes largely
unrecorded even in the preserved rockshelter deposits.
One of the running animal pictographs seemed a particularly apt sample to
radiocarbon date, first to directly establish the time during which Red Linear
pictographs were painted, and second to test the bison jump hypothesis. If the
date obtained on the sample coincided with a known period of occupation by
modern bison in the Lower Pecos region, the idea that the pictograph panel
represents a bison jump would gain credence.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

Radiocarbon dating of pictographs, other than those with charcoal as the
pigment, presupposes that an organic binder/vehicle was added to the pigment by
the prehistoric painters, both to enhance adhesion to the shelter wall, and to
improve spreadability. The red and yellow pigments used in the Lower Pecos
pictographs are iron oxide and!or iron hydroxides, and therefore cannot themselves be dated. The black pigments used in the Lower Pecos are manganese
oxides; charcoal use has not been demonstrated in the region. As only 0.1-1 mg
of organic carbon from the binder/vehicle is typically extracted from Lower
Pecos pictograph samples, care is required to avoid contamination of the sample
with extraneous carbon.
The walls of 41VV162A are heavily blackened, in some places almost
completely obscuring some badly deteriorated Pecos River style pictographs
(Turpin 1984: ! 85-186). The pictograph we sampled, however, was not blackened. Fifty-four and one-tenth mg of pale red, finely powdered pigment was
scraped off one of the running animal images. The scraped-off sample was
examined microscopically for contamination from organic sources such as roots
and fibers. Before insertion of the sample into the system, the plasma chamber
was cleaned thoroughly with oxygen plasmas to ensure negligible contamination
of the sample from the instrument.
After insertion of the sample in the reaction chamber, the system was
evacuated with liquid nitrogen sorption and ion pumps. These pumping techniques were employed because they do not use oil that could back-stream into the
system and introduce contamination. The sample and chamber were then cleaned
by argon plasmas. The argon plasma bombards the interior surfaces with excited,
high velocity, argon atoms and ions, thus loosening any adsorbed carbon dioxide
that is then pumped away. Six argon plasmas were performed to clean both the
chamber and sample. The final cleaning plasma generated a mere 0.7 micrograms of carbon (a microgram, p.g, is one-thousandth of a milligram).
We then performed a vacuum integrity check to ensure that leakage into
the chamber from the atmosphere was neglible. The vacuum integrity check
resulted in a final pressure of 1.2 x 10-6 torr of gas. If all the residual gas were
carbon dioxide, this pressure would represent about 0.00 l 5 btg of carbon, which
would decrease the reported age of the sample by only 16 days if the carbon
were modern.
At this point, the system was deemed ready for extraction of the organic
carbon from the pictograph sample. The oxygen plasma extraction of the organic carbon was performed for 50 minutes. It generated about 0.9 mg of carbon as carbon dioxide that was sealed into a 6 mm glass tube and sent to the
University of Arizona AMS facility for radiocarbon dating. Additional information on the instrumentation and experimental procedure can be found in
Chaffee et a!. (1993: 67-70).

A portion of unpainted limestone wall taken from near the pictograph was
also similarly treated to ascertain the extent of organic carbon inherent in the
limestone itself. The 212 mg sample was mostly a cream-colored powder, but
also included several small lumps of similar color. Two small black particles
were removed during the microscopic examination and discarded. After cleaning
the reaction chamber as described above, the unpainted limestone was inserted
into the plasma chamber. Four argon plasmas were then run to ensure desorption
of carbon dioxide from sample and chamber surfaces, with the last generating
only 0.3 gg of carbon. A vacuum integrity check was performed for six hours.
The pressure at completion was 9.8 x 10-5 torr, which would represent about 0.1
gg of carbon. If all the gas were modern carbon dioxide, this amount of contamination would decrease the reported age of this sample by about 60 days, a
negligible effect. The limestone contamination was then oxidized in the plasma,
yielding the equivalent to 79/ag of carbon after normalization of the weight of
the unpainted limestone sample to that of the pictograph sample.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The carbon extracted from the 41VV 162A pictograph sample was dated at
1280 + 45 years B.P. by the University of Arizona AMS facility (AA-10549).
Although the source of contamination generated from the unpainted cave wall is
unknown, the most extreme possible effects on the reported age of the sample
can be calculated by assuming either (1) that all the contaminant carbon is
modern (1950 carbon) or (2) that it is all dead.
The calculations were done using the following equations (Mook and
Waterbolk 1985:27). Equation 1 is used to convert the fractional activity of a
sample to a radiocarbon age:
14a = e-(T/8033)

(1)

where 14a is the fractional radiocarbon activity of the sample, and T is the age of
the sample in years. Equation 2 is used to calculate the effect of a known amount
of contamination on the reported radiocarbon age:
X = (14a- 14as)/(14ac -14as)

(2)

where X is the fraction contamination of the sample, 14as is the fractional
radiocarbon activity of the assumed "true" age of a sample, and 14ac is the
fractional radiocarbon activity of the contamination. The value of 14ac is 1 for
modern, and 0 for ancient (dead carbon) contamination. Applying these equations to our data, we calculate that the AMS date is too young by 135 years if the
contamination is modern; thus the corrected age in this case is 1415 years B.P.
Conversely, if the carbon is dead, the amount generated from the limestone

Ilger et al. ~ Red Linear Style Pictograph Radiocarbon Date

341

contamination would have the effect of decreasing the AMS date by 660 years;
this would change the result to 540 years B.P. Given the above, in the most
extreme cases, the age would fal! between 540 and t415 years B.P.
However, measurement of the degree of mass fractionation of carbon of the
samples permits constraining these extreme values of the age. ~13C values of
both the background limestone and the pictograph carbon dioxide were obtained
in an attempt to better understand the source of the carbon extracted from the
sample, and the contamination. 513C is defined as:

~13C

- (13C/12C)s - (13C/12C)pDB X 1000 %0
(13C/~-C)pDB

(3)

where the standard used (PDB) for 13C/12C measurements is carbonate obtained
from fossil shells of Cretaceous belemnite (Belemnitella americana) from the
PeeDee rock formation in South Carolina, and S refers to the sample in question
(either the unpainted limestone or the pictograph sample). Most ~13C values
measured on our other pictograph samples have been between -20 to -26%0; the
41VV162A pictograph sample was within this range at -20.2%0. The ~13C value
of the limestone sample carbon dioxide (from the unpainted limestone) was
-23. I%o.
Isotope fractionation, a consequence of the thermodynamic properties of
atoms, depends upon the mass of the atoms involved in various reactions.
Therefore, it is possible to use the degree of mass fractionation (i.e., the value
of ~13C) to identify materials that have gone through different geochemical or
biological processes (see Boutton 1991:173-183). The processes that produce
limestone result in a ~13C = 0%0; those which are typical animal and vegetable
organic material yield 813C values of- 19 to -25%0; those producing atmospheric
carbon dioxide result in a ~13C = -7.8%0. The mass fractionation value of the
background contamination on the unpainted limestone sample, 513C = -23.1%o,
indicates that it is neither atmospheric CO2, the most likely contaminant source
of modern carbon in our procedure, nor limestone decomposition CO2 (dead
carbon). Rathe,) it is presumably from contaminant organic carbon of unknown
age.
The fundamental underlying premise of the plasma-chemical dating technique is that the organic material extracted from the pictrograph itself was contemporary with the time it was painted. This is based on the argument that live
carbon was mixed into the paint as a binder/vehicle. That may not be strictly
true when charcoal is used as a pigment as charcoal is subject to the "old wood"
problem; that is, the charcoa! may be old at the time of painting (Schiffer 1986).
However, the pigment of this Red Linear pictograph was not charcoal. Some
time after a pictograph is painted a new accretion layer forms over the painting.
The outermost layer of the accretion is at any given time comprised of modern

carbon.

In practice, the organic matter that is extracted from a pictograph sample is
a composite of the pictograph organic matter and the contamination organic
matter in the accretion. The latter was probably deposited during a time interval
beginning somewhat before the application of the pictograph and continuing up
to modern time. This conclusion is based on the following simple model. A
limestone surface is a continually and uniformly changing chemical system,
developing by the buildup of accretionary minerals and periodically spalling off
due to physiochemical processes such as the freeze-thaw cycle. The spalling
process may also be hastened by biological activity. We have sometimes noticed
biological growths underneath a sample when removing seriously disjointed
pieces of pictographs for dating/chemical studies. This biological activity, although speeding the spallation process, is not likely responsible for the contamination carbon in a pictograph sample. All evidence of biological material is
carefully removed before subjecting a sample to the plasma treatment. Thus, we
assume that the background contamination we note is initially due to live carbon
in organic matter that is constantly being trapped from the air, and from surface
algae and bacterial growths in the accumulating accretion layer. In this model,
the outer microscopic surface layer constantly grows and is modern carbon at
any given moment until the surface spatls off. If the spall depth is large enough,
the remaining limestone surface will then be of infinite radiocarbon age, >40,000
years B.P.
The essential assumption of this simple model, then, is that accumulating
limestone surface layers continuously and uniformly incorporate ambient live
carbon as the layers are formed. Thus, the depth of a given layer is directly
proportional to the radiocarbon age of the contamination incorporated in that
layer. However, at any moment in time, the outside layer always corresponds to
live modern carbon. Only two situations would expose a truly ancient surface
(dead carbon) for a pictograph to be painted upon: a pre-treatment of the limestone face (intentional removal of the surface) to provide an improved base ibr
painting, or a naturally spalled surface that fell off relatively shortly before the
pictograph was painted. To expose an ancient surface, whether intentionally or
through natural processes, it is essential that enough of the surface be removed in
the evolving accretionary layer to reach underlying ancient ones. We have seen
no indication of prepared surfaces in the Lower Pecos River region. Instead,
sections often show that pictographs are painted on top of clearly existing
accretionary mineral growth (Figure 1). It is also unlikely that many pictographs
were painted soon after natural spallation exposed an ancient surface. We conclude that most pictographs in the Lower Pecos River region were painted on top
of evolving, and thus relatively young, surfaces. The microscopic layer lying
immediately beneath the pigmented layer would be virtually the same age as the
pigmented layer. If the above suppositions hold true, then contamination carbon
observed in the unpainted limestone by the plasma chemical treatment would be
a time-averaged composite of the relatively contemporary surficial layers which
were sampled.

Figure !. Section of a pictograph from 41VV75. It shows the limestone rock with an
underlying, previously existing, accretion layer upon which the pictograph was painted
(1), a red pigment layer (2), and finally an outer accretion layer which accumulated over
the paint (3).

For the Red Linear style pictograph date discussed in this paper, we scraped
off only a thin layer (<1/2 mm) of the pictograph and unpainted limestone
surfaces; therefore, contamination is expected to be relatively recent. Conservatively, therefore, the total limestone contamination carbon can be represented by
an age twice the nominal age of the outermost surface at the time of painting the
pictograph (i.e., the pictograph date). This is conservative because the plasma
technique would extract the carbon from both the oldest layer the plasma reaches
up through the most recent layer. The age of the contaminating carbon would be
a weighted average of those ages and, therefore, would be half the age of the
oldest sampled layer. That is to say, if it is assumed that the average age of the
contamination is twice the nominal pictograph age, the sampling goes deeper,
down to the layer that is four times the pictograph age (5!20 years B.P.). This
means that the extreme limit on the more recent age of 540 years B.P. is probably
much too modern. A more realistic calculation of this age can be attempted.
To recalculate the limit, it is assumed that the extreme on the more recent
age is represented by a contamination of nominally twice the pictograph age (i.e.,
2560 years B.P.). In that case, the corrected lower limit age becomes 1165 years
B.P. An estimate of the age, and its uncertainty, after considering the effect of the
background is an age lying between 1165 and 1415 years B.P. Since the measured

344

Texas Archeological Society

age of 1280 years B.P. is near the midpoint between these ranges, the date may
best be represented by 1280 years B.P. with an uncertainty that includes the
counting uncertainty (+ 45 years), as well as the uncertainty introduced by the
contamination (+_ 125 years). Statistically propagating the two uncertainties
produces an uncertainty of + 135 years. Thus, the effect of the background
contamination in this case is to increase the uncertainty given by counting
statistics alone by a factor of three without altering the estimation of the age
itself. Though we have presented a highly idealized model, we conclude that the
age uncertainty derived is approximately correct.
Until further information is available, the age of the Red Linear pictograph
dated here, 1280 + 135 B.P., best represents the time of painting of the Red
Linear style. We can convert this age into a calendar date by using the Stuiver
and Reimerâs (1993) 14C Age Calibration Program: a 1 sigma age range of cal
A.D. 649-892 and a 2 sigma age range of cal A.D. 541-1020.

SUMMARY
Grieder (1966:718) interpreted a Red Linear style pictograph scene at
41VV162A to be seventeen running animals, possibly deer or bison. Turpin
(1984:193) later suggested that this pictograph may represent bison being herded
toward a crack in the wall, symbolically depicting a bison jump. Bison were
known to be present in the Lower Pecos region in abundance in three different
periods (Dillehay 1974:181): Period I, from 10,000 to 6,000-5,000 B.C.; Period
II, from 2500 B.C. to A. D. 500; and Period III, A.D. 1200-1300 to 1550. If it is
assumed that the background-corrected age is 1280 + 135 years B.P. (an uncorrected A.D. 670 for comparison with Dillehayâs dates), the pictograph age nearly
overlaps within the one standard deviation error with the more recent end of
Dillehayâs Period II.
Clearly, more data on pictograph dates are needed, and additional dates wilt
be required to validate our results. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of this date until further studies are completed. Our laboratory is involved in
ongoing studies of the Red Linear style pictographs at other sites in the Lower
Pecos region of Texas.
