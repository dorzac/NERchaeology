ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the route of a proposed sanitary sewer line in
west-central Zapata County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research
Associates (BVRA) on March 23, 2010 under Antiquities Permit 5581 for the
County of Zapata. Two arroyo crossings, the site of two proposed lift stations, and
the area of previously recorded site 41ZP146 (totaling 0.78 acre) were investigated
through a surface inspection, backhoe trenching, and shovel testing. No
archaeological sites were found, and no artifacts were collected. Copies of the
report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas State Library, J. F. Fontaine & Associates,

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area consists of areas where the sanitary sewer line will cross
Arroyo Molletes, Arroyo Ranchito, the site of two proposed lift stations, and the area
where the Principal Investigator recorded prehistoric site 41ZP146 in 1993 on
personal time. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is within the right-of-way of
United States Highway 83 (on the east side) and Las Palmas Road (on the south
side) except for the site of the two proposed lift stations that are on private property
(Figure 1). The pipe is eight inches in diameter and will be placed in a trench two
feet wide and four feet (1.2 meters) deep. The two lift stations are to be
constructed on sites with a footprint 20 feet x 20 feet. Each lift station will be
primarily restricted to the surface with a well that will disturb the surface in an
area around six feet in diameter and up to six feet deep. The lift station near Las
Palmas will be constructed in an area that has been previously disturbed through
a receiving manhole, septic tank, and collection pond. The project area is
depicted on one USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle Zapata (2699-434) (Figure 2).

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This project was performed in order to identify any cultural resources that
might be present within the high probability areas and to assess the condition of
previously recorded prehistoric site 41ZP146. The client is the County of Zapata.
BVRA was retained by the client to perform the archaeological survey that was
required by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). William E. Moore was the
Principal Investigator, and James E. Warren performed the field survey with the
assistance of Arthur Romine and Colton Warren. The field survey involved 24
person hours and was performed on March 23, 2010. The federal agency that is
involved in this study is the USDA-RUS.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL and the Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas were checked for the presence of previously recorded
sites and other archaeological surveys in the project area and vicinity. Relevant
archaeological reports documenting work in Zapata County were reviewed in order
to become familiar with the types of prehistoric and historic sites found in the area.
Contract reports by Warren (1989, 1993), Uecker and Warren (2005), and Kotter
(1980) and a book by Thomas R. Hester (1980) were reviewed prior to this study. In
addition, James E. Warren shared his vast knowledge of this area and helped
formulate the Research Design. The project area was investigated by a 100%
Pedestrian Survey, backhoe trenches, and shovel testing. Five areas were
investigated, and they are defined as Area 1 (lift station near Las Palmas), Area 2
(crossing of Arroyo Molletes), Area 3 (crossing of Arroyo Ranchito), Area 4 (lift
station on south bank of Arroyo San Bartolo) and Area 5 (location of previously
recorded site 41ZP146). Before any subsurface investigations were conducted, the
survey crew walked over the entire APE and looked for cultural materials on the
surface and in the ditch profiles.
Area 1
Area 1 is the footprint of the proposed lift station on private property on the
northwest side of Las Palmas Road (Figure 2). After a visual inspection of the
surface revealed no evidence of a prehistoric or historic site, Backhoe Trench 1
was excavated. This trench was 14 feet long, 36 inches wide, and 75 inches deep
(see Appendix I for profiles of the backhoe trenches). It was dug through sandy
loam (5YR 4/3) to a depth of 38 inches and through sandy clay loam (10YR 6/5)
from 38 inches to 75 inches. This trench was terminated when the client informed
the survey crew that they had reached or surpassed the APE. No cultural materials
or features were observed.
Area 2
Area 2 is the crossing of Arroyo Molletes, and is within the right-of-way of
Las Palmas Road on both banks of the arroyo and on the northwest side of the
road (Figure 2). After a visual inspection of this area revealed no evidence of a
prehistoric or historic site, Backhoe Trench 2 and Backhoe Trench 3 were
excavated. Backhoe Trench 2 was dug on the northeast bank of the arroyo just
inside the fence within the highway right-of-way. It was 14 feet long, 36 inches
wide, and 58 inches deep. It was dug through fine sandy loam (10YR 4/4) with
gravels to a depth of 12 inches. The soil from 12 inches to the bottom of the trench
was the same fine sandy loam, but with no gravels. This trench was terminated
when the client informed the survey crew that they had reached or surpassed the
APE.

Backhoe Trench 3 was dug on the southeast bank of the arroyo just inside
the fence within the highway right-of-way. It was 14 feet long, 36 inches wide, and
60 inches deep. The top 18 inches consisted of fine sandy loam (10YR 4/4) with
gravels in the first 14 inches and no gravels in the next four inches. The underlying
soil was sandy clay loam (5YR 4/3). This trench was terminated when the client
informed the survey crew that they had reached or surpassed the APE. No cultural
materials or features were observed within either trench. Three percussion flakes
were found in the first 12 inches, but their context is not known. They were not
collected.
Based on the presence of cultural materials, the crew returned to the area
and excavated six shovel tests within the stratum where the flakes were found in an
attempt to locate additional materials that would delineate the size of this site within
the APE. Two shovel tests were excavated to the east of the backhoe trench, and
four shovel tests were excavated to the west of the backhoe trench (Figure 3).
These tests were numbered 1-6 and spaced six feet apart with the easternmost
trench (Shovel Test 3) being 15 feet from the arroyo. Shovel Test 1 (ST) was dug
to 24 inches through fine sandy loam with gravels (10YR 4/4), and the remainder of
the tests were dug through the same soil but to different depths. The depths of the
six tests varied from 24 inches at ST 1 to 26 inches at ST 2 (see Appendix II for
profiles of the shovel tests). The tests were 30 cm x 50 cm in size. Excavated
earth was screened using ¼” hardware cloth. Details regarding the shovel tests are
presented in Appendix II. No cultural materials or features were encountered in the
tests.
Area 3
Area 3 is the crossing of Arroyo Ranchito and is within the right-of-way of
Las Palmas Road on both banks of the arroyo and on the southeast side of the
road (Figure 2). After a visual inspection of this area revealed no evidence of a
prehistoric or historic site, Backhoe Trench 4 and Backhoe Trench 5 were
excavated. Backhoe Trench 4 was dug on the northeast bank of the arroyo just
inside the fence. It was 14 feet long, 36 inches wide, and 24 inches deep
(Appendix I). It was dug through sandy clay loam (10YR 6/4) with gravels to a
depth of 24 inches. This trench was terminated when sandstone bedrock was
encountered. Backhoe Trench 5 was dug on the southeast bank of the arroyo just
inside the fence within the highway right-of-way. It was 14 feet long, 36 inches
wide, and 62 inches deep. The first 30 inches consisted of loamy clay with gravels
(10YR 5/5) overlying several strata of clay with gravels before encountering
sandstone bedrock. No cultural materials or features were observed in either
trench.

Area 4
Area 4 is the footprint of the proposed lift station on private property on the
northeast side of Las Palmas Road and on the south bank of Arroyo San Bartolo
(Figure 2). After a visual inspection of the surface revealed no evidence of a
prehistoric or historic site, Backhoe Trench 6 was excavated. This trench was 14
feet long, 36 inches wide, and 85 inches deep. It was dug through sandy loam
(10YR 4/4) to a depth of 50 inches and through sandy loam (10YR 6/4) with pieces
of sandstone bedrock from 50 inches to 85 inches. This trench was terminated
when a layer of sandstone bedrock was encountered. No cultural materials or
features were observed.
Area 5
Area 5 is the location of previously recorded site 41ZP146 as plotted on the
topographic quadrangle at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)
and the south bank of the arroyo. This site is plotted as being on the north side of
Arroyo Bartolo and the east side of United States Highway 83. When this site was
recorded in 1993, the highway was a two-lane road. Since that time, it has been
expanded to five lanes within the last two years. The survey crew conducted a
thorough inspection of the exposed ground within the right-of-way and saw no
evidence of this site. At the time of this survey, the APE had been greatly disturbed
by highway widening and a paved entrance to a ranch. The right-of-way was found
to be within a ten-foot ditch, and the surface consisted of clay subsoil that pre-dates
human occupation. Figure 4 is a cross-section of the highway right-of-way that
illustrates the current condition of the right-of-way due to widening of the highway
and the probable condition of the right-of-way in 1993. The field survey crew
surmised that the portion of site 41ZP146 within the right-of-way had been
completely destroyed. Because the surface consisted of exposed clay subsoil, no
backhoe trench or shovel tests were excavated. The cut bank and exposed clay
subsurface were investigated for displaced cultural materials that may have eroded
from the high bank, but nothing was found. The south bank was equally disturbed.
Therefore, no backhoe trench was excavated in this area.

RESULTS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed one
previously recorded prehistoric site (41ZP146) had been recorded in close
proximity to the APE. A significant portion of United States Highway 83 had been
surveyed by a TxDOT sponsored project, but no professional investigations had
been conducted in the rest of the project area. The only cultural materials observed
in the entire project area were three percussion flake fragments within the first 12
inches of Backhoe Trench 3 in Area 2. Although it is possible that a prehistoric site
is present in the vicinity, the three flakes are viewed as an isolated occurrence of
minimal significance. Therefore, it was decided not to record this area as a site
given the fact that the actual context of the flakes is not known and no cultural
materials were found in the six shovel tests dug in the immediate area. Based on
extensive disturbance to the area due to widening of United States Highway 83 and
a paved road that leads to a private ranch, that portion of site 41ZP146 in the APE
has been disturbed to the point where it is not recognizable. Overall, the area
examined is void of cultural materials.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was found as a result of this
survey. It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during the
excavation of the trench at any of the areas investigated, all work must stop until
the THC can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in accordance with
the Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the THC.
