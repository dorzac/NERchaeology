ABSTRACT
The McKinney Independent School District (ISD) is planning to construct
a new football stadium and parking lots within a 64.391-acre tract in Collin
County, Texas. RLK Engineering contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. to
evaluate the proposed tract to determine if significant cultural resources are
within the project area. AR Consultants, Inc. identified two high potential
areas within the project area. The first high potential area is along the banks
of Sloan Creek and the second is associated with a possible historic
farmstead identified on historic aerials. The areas were surveyed on
September 8, 2016. Results along Sloan Creek were negative, but site
41COL276 was identified in the second high potential area. The site
consists of several features, including a cistern and a bois d’arc pier or pole
feature in the location of the former residence. However, much of the site
has been demolished and is deemed ineligible for National Register of
Historic Properties or State Antiquities Landmark listing. Given the results
of this survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural
resource investigations are unnecessary for this project, and requests that
the Texas Historical Commission concur with this recommendation.

INTRODUCTION
The McKinney Independent School District (ISD) is planning to construct a new football stadium
and parking lots within a 64.391-acre tract in Collin County, Texas (Figure 1). The project area is
located southeast of the intersection of Hardin Boulevard and McKinney Ranch Parkway. The tract
is located in an upland setting and much of it has been continuously farmed for more than 50 years.
The headwaters of Sloan Creek run through the northeast corner of the property and historic maps
and aerials show a structure located on the west side of the tract on Hardin Boulevard as early as
1962. Given the upland setting and lack of a reliable water source, it is not likely to contain
prehistoric cultural resources, AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) proposed intensive pedestrian survey
of two high potential areas within the property. The first area is located along the banks of Sloan
Creek within a 4-acre zone. The second is a 5.5-acre area in the southwestern part of the property
that may contain historic cultural resources associated with the structure identified on the historic
maps and aerials and contained in a densely wooded area.
RLK Engineering contracted with ARC to conduct an archaeological survey of the two high
potential areas within the stadium project area to determine if cultural resources are present within
the study areas and to make recommendations about their significance and how they might be
impacted by construction. Survey was conducted by Allen Rutherford and Joy Tatem on
September 8, 2016.
The cultural resource investigation was required because McKinney ISD is a State entity and Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 7768 was issued for the archaeological survey. Relevant legislation
includes the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). The
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission will review this report on behalf of the
State. Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and the
Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291).
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines used by the Archeology Division of the
THC (Council of Texas Archeologists n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of
the natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the culture history and previous
investigations within the study area. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed
in the investigation is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes
with recommendations followed by the references cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area is situated within the Northern Blackland Prairie Ecoregion of Texas. This
ecoregion is composed of rolling to nearly level plains that formed over Upper-Cretaceous marl,
chalk, limestone, and shale (Griffith et al. 2007:61-62). In a climax setting, the Northern Blackland
Prairie is a tallgrass prairie, dominated by big and little bluestem, Indiangrass, and tall dropseed
growing on the region’s deep, fertile, “black waxy” soil, which gives the Prairie its name. Oak,
hackberry, elm, ash, cottonwood, juniper, bois d’arc, and pecan trees grow in the stream valleys.
The project area is in an upland setting near the intermittent headwaters of Sloan Creek,
approximately 4.2 miles west of where the creek flows into Wilson Creek. It is wooded alongside
Sloan Creek and in the middle section of the project area, though much of it is in cultivated fields.
The majority of the project area is mapped on the Upper Cretaceous-aged Austin Chalk (Bureau
of Economic Geology 1991). This formation consists primarily of chalk and calcareous clay. The
soils along the drainage are mapped as Houston Black clay with 0- to 3-percent slopes, eroded
(Hanson and Wheeler 1969:Sheet 39). This series has a very dark gray A-horizon that is up to 44
inches thick and is underlain by light gray AC- and C-horizons. The central portion of the project
area, as well as the northeastern and southeastern corners, is mapped as Austin silty clay with 1to 3-precent slopes. This series is characterized by a 16-in-thick A-horizon of dark grayish-brown
silty clay above light brownish gray silty clay B-horizon.

CULTURE HISTORY
A prehistoric chronology, based on Prikryl (1990), with an added historic period, for North Central
Texas is presented below to provide the reader with a temporal framework for the culture history
of the region.
Historic European

Early

Paleoindian

A.D. 1800 to Present
A.D. 1600 to A.D. 1800 [Historic Native American]

A.D. 1400 to A.D. 1600

6,000 B.C. to A.D. 700
ca. 11,000 B.C. to 6,000 B.C.

The Paleoindian period is characterized as having small, nomadic bands of hunter-gatherers whose
primary emphasis was the exploitation of now-extinct megafauna, such as mammoth and bison.
Smaller game and plant gathering likely supplemented the Paleoindian diet (Meltzer and Bever
1995:59). As such, the archaeological record for the region consists of several distinctive styles of
projectile points, such as the Clovis, Plainview, and Folsom. Currently, no Clovis points have been
reported in Collin County, but numerous have been found in surrounding counties (Bever and
Meltzer 2007:67-70). Subsistence patterns began to change as a general drying climatic trend
swept the region, leading to extinction of many of the area’s large mammals toward the end of the
Paleoindian period.
The Archaic period is characterized by increased alluviation of water channels and a generally
wetter environment than the previous period. This change in climate resulted in modification of
Native American subsistence patterns, with broad exploitation of bottomland food resources. This,
in turn, resulted in clusters of seasonal settlements along large drainages, including the Trinity
River and its various forks and tributaries, and a marked increase in population density. With the
advent of repeated, seasonal occupation of sites along drainages came a perceived increase in
territorial constrictions among different groups in the region, with several authors citing the limited
use of regional lithic resources as evidence of this trend (Skinner 1981; Prewitt 1983).
The Late Prehistoric period is interpreted as a dryer period, with a focus on procurement of faunal
resources, agriculture, and food preservation. The appearance of pottery and the bow and arrow
help date artifact assemblages to this period (Shafer 1977). The Protohistoric period is
characterized by Native American abandonment of north central Texas in the period around
1500/1600, with almost no archaeological evidence found in the region dating to this time (Skinner
1988).
The Historic European period saw widespread Anglo settlement of north central Texas beginning
in the 1830s. This expansion often resulted in brutal conflicts between settlers and nomadic bands
of Native Americans (Garrett 1972:24). These early conflicts gave way to various Anglo strategies
aimed at cohabitation, including peace treaties signed as early as 1843. Eventually, the entirety of
north central Texas was settled, with numerous Anglo military installations established in the

region. After Texas became part of the United States in 1845, peace was short lived. The Civil
War took its toll on the north central Texas population, as most of the able-bodied men left to fight
for the Confederacy.
There is very little evidence of historic-era Native American occupation anywhere in the Dallas
area, although historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the early 1800s. Beginning in
the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, the aboriginal inhabitants continued to play a role in the
regional history. Garrett (1972:24) states, “Indian hostilities almost depopulated North Texas (of
Anglo dwellers) after 1839. It dwindled to less than half.” Hostilities continued until the Republic
of Texas and ten Native American tribes signed the Treaty of 1843. This treaty provided the
impetus for settlement of several North Central Texas counties.
Collin County was separated from Fannin County in 1846 and McKinney became the county seat
(Minor 2015). The first phase of settlement in Collin County was from 1840 to 1860. Commercial
farming was not important until after the Civil War, and the early settlers were essentially selfsufficient. Besides domestic plants and animals, wild animals and plants were commonly
consumed, so settlers established homesteads near creeks and rivers. In 1872, the Houston and
Texas Central Railway became the first major route through the county, initiating the second phase
of settlement near railroad hubs. By 1870, cotton, corn, and wheat were the main cash crops. The
county experiences continuous growth until the great depression, but like most of the county, had
recovered and was once again prospering by 1950. Post 1960, many farms and ranches turned to
mechanized techniques and relied less on tenant farmers who had dominated the workforce in the
1800s and early 1900s. This led to a general decline in the county’s population. Recent decades
have seen a dramatic increase in the county’s population and residential communities dominate
the present-day landscape.
Previous Investigations
A search of TASA (2016) located no historical markers, cemeteries, National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) properties, State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), or archaeological sites in the
project area. The project area also does not have any previously surveyed portions within its
boundaries, though several projects have been conducted within five miles of the area (TASA
2016).
From 1990 to 2008, a total of five surveys for parks, highways, and electric lines were conducted
by various companies within a mile of the project area; none of these surveys recorded anything
of cultural significance. However, ARC has conducted three surveys just outside the project area.
One survey was of Fairview Park, approximately 4 miles west of the project area. Skinner and
Kent (1999) discovered two buried prehistoric site deposits (41COL115 and 41COL116) in the
overbank sediments along Sloan Creek. The sites were shallowly buried and contained fire-cracked
rock, bone and a small amount of lithic debris. Another project conducted by Skinner and Kent
(1999) approximately 5 miles northwest of the study area recorded nine historic sites (41COL105
and 107-114). Seven of these sites had standing structures, one historic scatter, and the other a
foundation and cistern. While some of these house sites were shown on the 1930 soil map, most
were dated to the mid-century. The third ARC survey didn’t record any sites.

Approximately 1.5 miles northwest of the study area, a large survey of Stonebridge Ranch was
conducted by North American Consultants, Inc. which recorded fifteen sites (41COL67-81) of
prehistoric and historic interest (La Vadera and Geister 1988). These sites consisted of one
cemetery, three standing historic house sites, nine historic scatters, one prehistoric scatter, and one
multicomponent scatter; most of these historic sites could be dated from the early to midnineteenth century and the prehistoric to the Late Archaic time period.
The 1930 Collin County Soil Map and the 1936 and 1959 Collin County General Highway maps,
(GHMs) along with several USGS topographic maps and aerial photographs were reviewed as part
of this evaluation. The maps show one structure on the western edge of the study area. A structure
is drawn on the 1930 soil map, the GHMs, and the 1962 and 1968 topographic maps. The
topographic maps include an additional structure to the southeast of the one shown on the 1930
map. Aerials from 1953 and 1968 confirm the presence of a farmstead in that location. The
farmstead includes a residence, two barns, and two additional outbuildings. The structures are not
shown on more recent topographic maps or in the 1995 aerial.

RESEARCH DESIGN
Research Design
The study areas are located within a larger tract. The first study area is located along the portion
of Sloan Creek that runs through the northeast corner of the tract. The second study area is located
in the southwest part of the tract and includes the location of a potential historic site identified on
historic maps and aerials. Based on the previous investigations, the area has low potential for
containing prehistoric cultural resources and high potential to encounter historic cultural resources.
The research questions below were developed to examine the potential of the study areas.
The portion of Sloan Creek that runs through the project area is near the headwaters of the creek.
There is no floodplain mapped along the creek and several studies in Collin County have shown
that the uplands in this region hold very low potential for archaeological sites due to the degrading
environment and heavy historic farming. Prehistoric sites in this region are typically located
directly adjacent to significant drainages, which would allow for access to water and food
resources. There is documented evidence of Uvalde gravels in upland settings in Collin County so
it is possible that temporary-use sites may be located along Sloan Creek in this location, but the
potential is very low.
Previous investigations and historic maps have shown that potential for historic archaeological
resources exists primarily in relationship to the farmstead noted on historic maps and aerials. The
historic site could consist of structures, cisterns, barns, outhouses, and trash scatters. Since the
study area has been continuously occupied since the early 20th century, historic artifact scatters
could be dumped along Sloan Creek.
Methodology
Survey was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth by the THC (n.d.). Field personnel
excavated an average of two shovel tests per every two acres where the slope was less than 20percent and the ground visibility less than 30-percent. Shovel tests (STs) averaged 30 cm in
diameter. All loamy and friable clay soils were screened through ¼” wire mesh screens. The dense
compact clay was inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine if
cultural materials were present. Additional shovel tests were excavated to delineate positive shovel
tests with no less than six shovel tests around the original positive. ST soil matrices were described
on the basis of composition, texture, and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart (2009) was used to
identify soil colors. The authors made notes about the ground exposure, drainages, soil types, and
disturbed areas where subsoil was exposed. Photographs were taken during the survey using a 16megapixel, GPS-equipped, digital camera. ST and project boundary locations were marked with a
handheld GPS receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into three sections. The first describes the project area’s natural setting
along with results of the pedestrian survey. Shovel tests are described generally throughout the
text, but are detailed in Table 1 at the end of the Survey Results section. The site description and
conclusions round out the chapter.
Survey Results
A total of 36 shovel tests (STs) were excavated in the two high potential areas identified prior to
survey. Of those 36, 18 were excavated as part of the original survey (Figure 2). The survey crew
began in the northwest portion of the study area where Sloan Creek flows through it. Survey started
just south of McKinney Ranch Pkwy along the banks of Sloan Creek. The general environment
along Sloan Creek consists of a wooded area bordered on either side by cultivated fields. The
woods are sporadic and not dense, allowing areas of tall grasses to grow. Vegetation includes bois
d’arc, juniper, oak, greenbriar, sunflowers, and ankle- to waist-high grasses. With this and leaf
cover, ground visibility was approximately 0- to 30-percent (Figure 3). STs 1-8 were excavated
along the banks of Sloan Creek and generally revealed a 10-25 cm thick top layer of very dark
gray to black clay underlain by clay with calcium carbonate gravel. All of the shovel tests were
negative and no other cultural resources were identified on the surface in this area.
The second area the crew surveyed had a similar environment to the first, but a larger area and
without a drainage. A total of ten shovel tests were excavated in this area as part of the original
survey. The wooded area is bordered on the north by a field overgrown with sunflowers and to the
south by a plowed field. The eastern boundary of this study area is S. Hardin Blvd. Of the original
ten shovel tests, ST13 was positive for historic artifacts in its first two levels. The artifacts are
discussed in more detail in the site description below. The other nine shovel tests (ST9-12 and 1418) revealed 20-30 cm of very dark gray to black clay underlain by very dark clay with calcium
carbonate. Several historic scatters and features were identified between S. Hardin Blvd. and ST13.
All of these cultural resources are described in greater detail in the site description below. In the
part of the study area east of ST13, no cultural features were identified on the surface with the
exception of a wood chipper (Figure 4).

Site 41COL276
Site 41COL276 is a 40 m north/south by 109 m east/west historic farmstead located approximately
485 m north of the intersection of SH121 and S. Hardin Blvd. (Figure 5). Based on historic aerials,
the farmstead consisted of five structures including a house, two outbuildings, and what appear to
be two large barns as late as 1968. At some point between 1968 and the present, the farmstead was
demolished. The only remaining evidence of the farmstead are two sets of concrete blocks in linear
patterns, a brick-lined cistern, and what appear to be two lines of piers that may have been the
foundation of a 15x20 foot building (Figure 6). In addition to these features, much of the area
mapped within the boundary of the site is covered in trash, sheet metal, broken window glass, tin
cans, glass jars, and scatters of broken whiteware. In total there are 30-40 tin cans, 10-15 glass jars
with screw top metal lids, and 90-100 pieces of whiteware. Additionally, several brick scatters
were identified. Atlas and Ferris bricks were noted in the scatters. Atlas Brick Company was
founded in Ferris, Texas in 1895 and the Ferris Press Brick Company opened five years later (Hart

13

2016). Brick making in Ferris continued to dominate the local economy through the 1980s (Hart
2016). Other than the bricks, no diagnostic artifacts were found among the scatters, but they all
appear to date to the early to mid-20th century. Trying to determine their association to the former
farmstead is complicated because of the sites proximity to S. Hardin Blvd.
In addition to the original positive shovel test (ST13), a total of 18 shovel tests were excavated to
determine the extent of the site (Figure 7). Five of those shovel tests (STs 17, 24-25, 28, and 31)
were positive with historic artifacts (Table 2). All but two of the STs were only positive in Level
1. They generally consisted of clear glass shards, brick and clay pieces, unidentifiable metals and
wire nails, and pieces of whiteware (Figure 8). Shovel tests 17 and 25 included milk glass shards,
ST25 also had a piece of porcelain, and ST24 had a cobalt glass shard. Wire nails, milk glass, and
cobalt glass recovered from shovel tests range anywhere in date from the 1890s to the mid-20th
century. The whitewares and clear glass shards are essentially undateable. Based on historic aerial
photos, all of the positive shovel tests are located in the backyard area between the main residence
and the one of the barns.
No shovel tests were excavated in the former location of the residence due to the presence of the
concrete features, cistern, and possible piers, as well as relatively dense scatters of tin cans. The
first concrete feature is several blocks of 4x4 foot composite concrete that are approximately one
foot thick. They may be pieces of a former concrete foundation, or may not be associated with the
former residence at all. They are in a linear pattern and somewhat piled on top of each other, which
seems to indicate that they are not in their original location, and the brick-lined cistern is located
at the western end of the line of blocks. The cistern is lined with bricks from the ground surface to
approximately five feet below the surface, at which point cut limestone is visible for another three
feet down to the surface of the water. It appears that the limestone mouth begins to widen at this
depth, but the water obscures further visual observation. The diameter of the cistern is 33.5 inches
(Figure 9). The second concrete feature is another line of concrete blocks of similar size to the first
feature but only about two inches thick. As with the other concrete feature these blocks may not
be in their original location, but they might form a concrete walkway. The final feature is ten bois
d’arc piers or pole bases (Figure 10). They are placed in two parallel lines on a north/south axis
with those on the north/south axis placed five feet apart and east/west approximately 15 feet apart
to create the base of a 15x20 foot structure. Most of the poles have been burned to ground level
and there was some evidence of burnt material around the bases that were long enough to indicate
that these might have been poles instead of piers. They may have been the support poles for a
porch structure on the west side of the former residence. There is not enough remaining structural
evidence in its original context to determine the form of the former house or its general type within
the context of broader farmstead organizational patterns in rural Texas.

Deeds research was conducted on the property in order to determine whether any person/s of
significance owned the property throughout its history. Ownership was traced to the sale of the
property by S.J. Kirkpatrick to Edwin A. Newsome in 1890. The Newsomes ran a mercantile
business in McKinney and it was noted in E.A. Newsome’s obituary that he was one of the
wealthiest people in Collin County and the director of the Collin County National Bank, the Texas
Cotton Mills, and several enterprises at the time of his death in 1923 (Lythgoe 2016). The property
remained in the Newsome family until they sold it to J.K. and Lizzie Noles in 1942. Noles opened
and ran a general store in McKinney that still has a location open in Denton (Noles General Store
2016). The Noles sold the property to Wiley L. Housewright in 1954. Housewright sold the
property to L.D. Dutton ten years later, who subsequently sold the property to J.E. Bush in 1969.
The property was sold through the Bush Foundation in 1977 to the first of several urban
developmental groups to own the property from 1977 to the present. The property was sold to
McKinney ISD in 2011 by one such developmental group, Hardin 121 Investment Partners.
Despite an interesting ownership history, the property was not owned by anyone of significance
relative to NRHP standards. The site also has very little integrity and does not contain any
diagnostic artifacts. None of the structures shown on the 1968 historic aerial are currently present
and the only remaining evidence of them are displaced concrete, a cistern, and the bases of ten
support poles or piers. As such, the site is recommended as being not eligible for listing on the
NRHP under criteria A, B, C, or D and is not eligible for SAL status.
Conclusions
Beyond site 41COL276, no other cultural resources were found during the survey of the high
potential areas within the McKinney ISD Stadium project area. In terms of prehistoric resources,
no evidence of occupation was found in the high potential area along Sloan Creek. This is likely
the result of the fact that the drainage is intermittent in this location as it is near the upland
headwaters. Intermittent streams do not provide a consistent source of water conducive to
prehistoric occupation. Sloan Creek is a more viable water source downstream from the project

area. Site 41COL276 is the remains of a historic farmstead. The site was almost completely
demolished at some point between 1968 and 1995 leaving only a cistern, displaced concrete, and
wood pole or pier bases. No diagnostic artifacts were identified in shovel tests or on the surface
beyond two types of bricks within the site boundary. ARC concludes that the site is not
recommended as eligible for NRHP listing under criteria A, B, C, or D or for listing as an SAL.
No other historic artifacts or features were identified in shovel tests or on the surface.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present in
the proposed McKinney ISD Stadium project area in Collin County, Texas. Site 41COL276 is the
remains of a historic farmstead, but is not recommended eligible for NRHP or SAL listing. No
other cultural resources were identified on or below the surface during the survey. Based on the
results of the survey, ARC concludes that further cultural resource investigations for this project
are unwarranted, and requests that the THC concur with this recommendation. However, if buried
cultural materials are discovered during construction, the Archeology Division of the THC should
be notified.
