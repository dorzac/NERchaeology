ABSTRACT
North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) is proposing to
construct the Lower Bois d’Arc Creek Reservoir in northeast Fannin
County, Texas. Due to the proposed inundation, nine bridge/culvert
locations will be inundated, and new bridges/culverts will be constructed.
White Hawk, which is handling the engineering for the project, contracted
with AR Consultants, Inc. to evaluate the proposed bridge locations to
determine if significant cultural resources are within the study areas. Prior
to and during the cultural resources survey, it was thought that 11
locations would be impacted and 11 were surveyed. After the survey was
complete, it was determined that locations 4A and 8 would not be
impacted by this project. Even so, the survey results for these two
locations is included in this report. All road improvements and new
construction will take place within a study area that can vary from 140 to
300 feet wide. In total, 112.11 acres were surveyed.
The routes were surveyed on August 29-31, 2016, January 30-February 2,
and May 11 2017. During the survey, four historic sites (41FN253,
41FN255, 41FN256 and 41FN257) and one site (41FN254) with historic
and prehistoric components were recorded. No historic artifacts were
collected; prehistoric artifacts and notes from these sites will be curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas
in Austin. As land access on private land was only granted within the
easement, the sites on private land could only be fully defined, recorded,
and evaluated within these corridors. Sites found on land owned by
NTMWD were recorded fully. Because of this, site 41FN257, which sits
on private land, was not fully recorded.
Therefore, only the portion of the site within the project area can be
evaluated, and site 41FN257 is recommended not eligible for inclusion on
the National Register of Historic Places or as a State Antiquities
Landmark. Sites 41FN253, 41FN254, 41FN255, and 41FN256, which
were recorded fully, are also recommended not eligible for inclusion on
the National Register of Historic Places or as State Antiquities Landmark.
Given the results of this survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that
further cultural resource investigations are unnecessary for this project,
and requests that the Texas Historical Commission concur with this
recommendation.

INTRODUCTION
North Texas Municipal Water District is proposing to construct the Lower Bois d’Arc Creek
Reservoir in northeast Fannin County, Texas. Due to the proposed inundation, nine
bridge/culvert locations will be inundated, and new bridges/culverts will be constructed to
replace them. Because these areas are located on the edges of the proposed reservoir, each study
area is in the upper ends of the watershed near small creek headwaters. Prior to and during the
cultural resources survey, it was thought that 11 locations would be impacted and 11 were
surveyed. After the survey was complete, it was determined that locations 4A and 8 would not be
impacted by this project. Even so, the survey results of these two locations is included in this
report. All road improvements and new construction will take place within study areas which
vary in width from 140 to 300 feet, and total 112.11 acres.
White Hawk, which is handling the engineering for the project, contracted with AR Consultants,
Inc. to evaluate the proposed bridge locations to determine if significant cultural resources are
within the study areas. The study areas were surveyed August 29-31, 2016, January 30-February
2, and May 11, 2017.
The cultural resource investigation was required because North Texas Municipal Water District
is a State entity and Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7677 was issued for the archaeological
survey. Additionally, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has jurisdiction at creek
crossings. Relevant federal and state legislation includes the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas
Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191), Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as
amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No. 11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural
Environment,” and Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties
(36CFR800), Appendix C. The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission and
USACE will review this report as part of the Section 106 process.
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines adopted by the Archeology Division
of the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and developed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the natural setting of the
project area, followed by a discussion of the culture history and previous investigations in the
region surrounding the study areas. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed
in the investigation is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes
with recommendations followed by the references cited. Four appendices are included: the
results of the architectural historian’s review of the existing bridges; photographs showing the
visual area of potential effect for the proposed bridges/culverts, shovel test descriptions for
shovel tests not placed in archaeological sites, and a specimen inventory including detailed
analysis of artifacts found during survey.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area is situated on the margin of the Northern Post Oak Savanna (to the north) and
Northern Blackland Prairie (to the south) ecoregions of Texas. The Northern Post Oak Savanna
is composed of rolling to nearly level plains that formed over Eocene and Paleocene-age
formations, with some Cretaceous rocks to the north (Griffith et al. 2007:66). Woodlands in the
Northern Post Oak Savanna are composed mostly of post oak, blackjack oak, eastern red cedar,
and black hickory, though most land currently has more improved pastures. Little bluestems and
other grasses are found in prairie openings (Griffith et al. 2007:66).
The project area consists of several proposed bridge crossings that span drainages in the Bois
d’Arc Creek watershed; the study areas cross upland, terrace, and floodplain settings. These
bridges will cross Sandy Branch, Timber Creek, Thomas Branch, Onstott Creek, Ward Creek,
Yoakum Creek, Allen’s Creek, and Honey Grove Creek, as well as three unnamed tributaries of
Bois d’Arc Creek. All of these streams ultimately flow into Bois d’Arc Creek, which is a
tributary of the Red River.
Several geological formations underlie the project area. Study Areas 2, 3, 4A, 23, and 27 are
located primarily on the Bonham Formation, a Late Cretaceous-aged formation consisting
primarily of mudstone and clay. Study Areas 1, 8, 12, 13, and 22 are mostly on the Late
Cretaceous-aged Blossom Sand formation, composed of quartz sand that grades west into
calcareous clay. Study Area 8A is located on the Brownstone Marl formation, a clay formation
that also dates to the Late Cretaceous period. Quaternary-aged alluvium is mapped within Study
Areas 2, 3, and 22, which cross larger Bois d’Arc Creek tributaries (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1991). Four different soil profiles are found within the floodplains in the project area
(Goerdel 2001). Study Areas 2, 3, and 27 are mapped within Dela loam, a series that is
occasionally flooded and has a dark grayish brown A horizon up to 12 inches that transitions into
a yellowish brown to very pale brown C horizon. Study Area 23 lies within the Hopco silt loam,
an occasionally flooded series which has a 60-inch-thick, very dark grayish brown to very dark
gray A horizon that is above an olive brown B horizon. The Elbon silty clay loam series is found
at Study Areas 1 and 13. This frequently flooded series consists of very dark grayish brown silty
clay loam to dark grayish brown silty clay, with a 21-inch-thick A horizon. The last floodplain
soil profile in the project area is the Frioton silty clay loam series, found at Study Areas 8 and
8A. Occasionally flooded with silty clay loam throughout, 37 in of very dark gray to very dark
brown A horizon is located above a very dark gray C horizon. Upland and terrace soils in the
Ellis, Freestone, Hicota, Ivanhoe, Leson, Normangee, Porum, and Whakana series are mapped
adjacent to the floodplains. These soils typically have shallow A horizons of varying type and
hue over clayey B horizons; depth to subsoils is 4-18 in.

and Perttula (1998, 2004):

Early Archaic
6,000 to 4,000 B.C.
Paleoindian
12,000 to 6,000 B.C.
The earliest occupation in Fannin County was during the Paleo-Indian period (12000-6000 B.C.)
by Native Americans who made very distinctive Clovis points. Such points, generally
constructed from non-local material, have been found throughout Fannin County, both in the
north along Bois d’Arc Creek, and in the south along the valley of the North Sulphur River
(Skinner et al. 2005; Bousman and Skinner 2007). Despite these documented finds, data on the
Paleo-Indian occupation of Fannin County remains insufficient, due to the preponderance of
surface scatter artifact recovery. However, Paleo-Indian occupation is thought to have lasted
until at least 8,000 BP. It is thought that the lack of perennially occupied sites, the abundance of
non-local cherts, and the abundance of spear points suggest that the Paleo-Indian peoples were
highly nomadic, mobile hunters (Mahoney 2001:8).
Subsequent occupation during the Archaic period (6000-200 B.C.) is recognized as having three
temporal divisions: Early, Middle, and Late. During all three, groups are characterized as being
mobile bands that subsisted by hunting and gathering. In the Early Archaic, group territories
were poorly defined and sites were either transitory sites represented by lithic scatters or were
repeatedly occupied. Burned rock features occur in the Middle Archaic and indicate cooking and
greater use of plant food. In the Late Archaic, it appears that group mobility was limited by an
increased population density and group territories were more tightly defined. The use of local
lithic material instead of exotic material tends to support this idea (Perttula 1998:17–18).
During the Woodland period, which ranged from 200 B.C. to A.D. 800 the population became
more sedentary as indicated by the presence of rectangular houses, thick-walled Williams Plain
pottery, and the increased presence of plant foods including domesticated corn. Gary dart points
were ultimately replaced by arrow points (Perttula 2001:67) during this period. Shell-tempered
pottery is found at the campsites occupied by these Late Prehistoric hunters and gatherers.
Historic reports tell of Native American groups in the 1700s and early 1800s but virtually no

evidence of these groups has been recorded (Skinner 1988). Widely scattered historic Native
American archaeological sites have been described well outside the study area near Emory (Jelks
1967) and Paris (Harriset al. 1965). Mid- and late-1800 Anglo American sites are present in the
uplands and along the drainage valleys where settlers built houses and farmed small plots until
the advent of breaking tractors allowed for the farming of the Blackland Prairie.
Fannin County, originally to be named Independence County, was formed from Red River
County by the Republic of Texas Congress on December 14, 1837. It was ultimately named for a
hero of the Texas Revolution, James Walker Fannin, Jr. (Carter 1885; Strickland 1930; Hodge
1966; Scott 1982). After the Civil War, Fannin County was prosperous with record growth in
agricultural businesses. In 1873, the Texas and Pacific Railway built its tracks through the
county. Cotton production peaked in 1920 and Lone Star Gas Company ran natural gas lines
through the county in 1925. The Great Depression of the 1930s imposed economic hardship on
the county’s businesses and residences, and the population of Bonham steadily decrease. Today,
the largest city in the county is Bonham, which is the county seat, with around 7000 residents,
and Honey Grove being the second-largest with roughly 2000 residents.
Previous Investigations
An archaeological survey of Timber Creek Reservoir (now known as Lake Bonham) recorded
prehistoric archaeological sites in the Timber Creek valley west of the Study Areas 2/3 (Hsu
1968). This survey located two prehistoric sites, 41FN15 and 41FN16, which contained pottery
and assorted lithic debris, and are now underwater within the confines of Lake Bonham (Jones
2008: 10). Just north of Study Area 22, an archaeological survey was conducted by Geo-Marine
Inc. in 2009 as part of a larger TxDOT project to improve bridges in a multi-county area (Allday
2011). No sites were discovered during this investigation (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
[TASA] 2016).
The most relevant previous investigation to the current project was the survey work conducted
by ARC for the Lower Bois d’Arc Creek Reservoir project area in 2011 and 2013 (Davis et al.
2014). The project’s research design focused on three major research topics: Late Pleistocene
Geomorphology, The Shifting Ecotone, and Settling Into the Region (Skinner et al. 2010). The
research design developed a sampling strategy that focused on landforms likely to have been
occupied prehistorically and historically. Approximately 5,000 acres were surveyed focusing on
the creek channels and high potential settings. A total of 58 sites (28 prehistoric, 26 historic, and
four prehistoric/historic) were recorded (Davis et al. 2014:377). Eighteen of these required more
work before eligibility determinations could be made; the rest were determined not eligible for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Additionally, 38 standing structures
were found to meet the historic-age guidelines. These were evaluated for eligibility for listing on
the NRHP; none were determined eligible for the NRHP. The results of the survey demonstrated
that the earliest occupation was during the Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods and that the
terrace sediments were flushed out of the valley before 2000 B.C. In situ evidence of occupation
during the Late Archaic and Woodland periods was sporadic. Early Caddo occupation may have
occurred around A.D. 1000 and only minimal evidence of later Caddo occupation was found.
The majority of the historic sites date to the late-19th to mid-20th century. Oral histories confirm
that most 19th-century residences were removed to increase farm and pasture land, or were
replaced by modern structures. Additionally, 156 acres of private property within the reservoir

area was surveyed in 2015, after having been denied access during the initial 2013 survey. Six
sites were found within the area, three of which had been previously recorded (Perttula et al.
2016). Of these sites, three were prehistoric, one historic, and two were multi-component (Davis
and Skinner 2016). Eligibility determinations for theses six sites have not yet been made, but
three were recommended for further work and the other three were recommend not eligible for
listing on the NRHP.
Historic Map and Aerial Review
Historic maps reviewed prior to this project included the 1936 General Highway Map of Fannin
County (GHM), the 1939 Fannin County Soil Map (FCSM), the 1949 Honey Grove, TX 15’
USGS topographic quadrangle (quad), and the 1958 Bonham, TX 15’ quad. Aerial photographs
from 1937, 1949, 1950, and 1955 were reviewed as well. More recent images, including 7.5’
quads from 1985 and aerial photographs from 1976 to present, were also reviewed. The 1939
FCSM, which was drafted with far more accuracy than the 1936 GHM, was considered the
earliest map with which one might locate historic structure locations with any reliability. The
1939 FCSM showed structures in or near Study Areas 2, 3, 8A, 12, and 27 (Figure 2). Single
structures in more or less these same locations were present on the 15’ USGS quads in Study
Areas 2, 3, 8A, and 27; at Study Area 12, multiple structures are shown along FM 1396 (Figure
3). The 1985 USGS quads show three structures southeast of the intersection of CR 2680 and CR
2610 (Study Areas 2/3), where only one structure had been shown on earlier maps; the structure
farther south, along the west side of CR 2610, was still present at that time, along with a second
(Figure 4a). No structures were mapped in Study Areas 8A or 12 by 1985 (Figure 4b and Figure
4c). Two structures were shown at the south end of Study Area 27 in 1985, along with two more
farther west (Figure 4d). Review of historic aerial photography generally confirms these changes,
with one exception: the structures shown in Study Area 12 on maps prior to the 1980s are shown
outside the study area on 1950 aerials (Figure 5) and FM 1396 followed a slightly different path
than it does today.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Based on the research conducted prior to the survey, two hypotheses were developed. First, it
was hypothesized that there is limited potential for encountering prehistoric archaeological sites
in the tributary floodplains. Each of the tributaries crossed by this project’s study areas are fairly
high in their respective watersheds and have relatively narrow floodplains. The food resources
(both plant and animal) in these areas would have been scant, especially when compared to the
broader floodplains not far downstream. Sites that might be found in the current project’s
settings would likely be small, limited scatters of artifacts and will not likely represent large
campsites, which tend to be found on the terrace/floodplain margins in the Bois d’Arc Creek
watershed.
The second hypothesis states that there was high potential for encountering historic sites near the
locations where structures have been shown on historic maps. In total, this includes five locations
in the project area, each of which is described in the previous chapter. Other than these locations,
the potential for historic sites is moderate to low. However, artifact scatters constituting dumped
trash might be present along historic roads or drainages encountered within the study areas.
Residential features are not expected to have been built in the any of the creek floodplains.
Methodology
Survey was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth by the THC (n.d.). Field
personnel walked the study areas starting at the crossing and placed shovel tests every 100 m on
both sides of the road or proposed road centerline. Shovel tests were placed where the slope was
less than 20 percent and the ground visibility less than 30 percent; they averaged 30 cm in
diameter. All sandy and loamy soils were screened through ¼” wire mesh screens. The clay fill
was inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine if cultural materials
were present. ST soil matrices were described on the basis of composition, texture, and color.
The Munsell Soil Color Chart (2009) was used to identify soil colors. The field crew made notes
about the ground exposure, drainages, soil types, and disturbed areas where subsoil was exposed.
Photographs of each existing bridge and culvert were taken from multiple angles, where
possible. Photographs were taken during the survey using a 16-megapixel, GPS-equipped, digital
camera. Site boundaries, STs, IOs, and study area locations were marked with a handheld GPS
receiver.
The existing bridges/culverts were researched and, when 40 years old or older, evaluated by an
architectural historian; these results are included as Appendix A. A 300-ft visual APE was
studied around each proposed bridge/culvert location. Vegetation that may limit the visual APE
of each proposed bridge/culvert was recorded by taking a panoramic photograph from each end
of the proposed bridge/culvert area. These photographs are included as Appendix B and show the
general setting of each study area. The visual APE was also evaluated in the field by looking for
standing structures or other features that would be visible from the entire proposed bridge.
Lastly, the APE was examined on high-resolution aerial photographs for structures or other
features that might be within it.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into three sections. The first describes the project area’s natural setting
along with results of the pedestrian survey. The second section describes sites 41FN253-257 in
detail; conclusions derived from the survey close the chapter. Shovel tests are described
generally throughout the text, but are detailed in Tables 3-7 (site specific) in the respective site
sections and in Appendix C (general project).
Survey Results
The study areas were situated in three types of settings: fields (Figure 6), pastures (Figure 7), and
woodlands (Figure 8). Fields were characterized by open, often plowed, agricultural areas with
30 to 100 percent ground visibility. Pastures were characterized by ankle- to chest-high grasses,
resulting in 0 to 30 percent ground visibility. Woodland vegetation included pecan, post oak,
bois d’arc, junipers, cedars, cedar elms, mesquite, honey locust, greenbriar, and some cactus; leaf
cover and underbrush resulted in 0 to 20 percent ground visibility.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF FANNIN COUNTY BRIDGES

Fifteen shovel tests (STs) were excavated throughout the proposed study area. Generally, the A
horizons of these STs ranged from 8 to 80 cm thick and included very dark grayish brown to
dark yellowish brown, sandy clay loam to silty sand soils, occasionally mottled with silty clay. B
horizon soils consisted of black to yellowish red silty loam, sandy clay, and clay. No artifacts or
features were found in the STs or on the surface in this study area. Existing Bridge 1 was built in
1990 (Appendix A). No cultural resources were visible from Proposed Bridge 1 (Figure B-1) or
on aerial photographs within the 300-ft visual APE (Figure 9).
Study Areas 2/3 (Bridges)
These study areas are situated in a combination of pasture, field, and woodland settings (Figure
10). Existing Bridge 3 crosses Sandy Branch and Existing Bridge 2 crosses Timber Creek.
Between wooded areas, the study areas crossed pastures with 0 to 30 percent ground visibility. A
total of 72 STs were excavated throughout these proposed study areas; of these, 42 STs lie within
the boundaries of five newly recorded sites (41FN253-257), which are discussed in detail below.
Generally, the A horizons exposed in these STs were 5-60 cm thick and were very dark grayish
brown to yellowish brown/red silty sand to clay. Mottling was common. These are underlain by
mottled B horizons of silty/sandy clay in a variety of colors (brownish gray, yellowish
brown/red, strong brown, pink). ST3-1 recovered a fence staple from 10-20 cmbs; however,
since it was not discernibly historic, and likely came from the adjacent fence or road, it was not
considered an IO. In the western end of the study area, approximately ten shards of whiteware
(likely from the same vessel, as well as two fragments of metal sheeting were found on the
surface; ST3-19 was placed in this location but no artifacts were recovered below the surface.
These items were also not identifiable as distinctly historic. All other STs were devoid of cultural
material.
Existing Bridge 2 and 3 were both built in 1989 (Appendix A). No cultural resources were
visible from Proposed Bridge 2 (Figure B-2) or on aerial photographs within the 300-ft visual
APE (Figure 10). However, 41FN256 lies just east of Proposed Bridge 3, visible from the
Proposed Bridge 3 location (Figure B-3) and on aerial photographs within the 300-ft visual APE
(Figure 10). The possible effects of Proposed Bridge 3 on this site are discussed in the sites
section.
Study Area 4A (Bridge-Not Affected)
This study area is situated in a woodland setting and is roughly bisected by an existing two-track
road; it also crosses over a 1st-order intermittent tributary of Bois d’Arc Creek (Figure 9). A total
of nine STs were excavated throughout this proposed study area. Generally, the A horizons of
these STs were 15-85 cm thick and consisted of grayish/yellowish brown to reddish yellow silty
sand and sandy loam; these soils were mottled in ST4A-2 and 4A-5. ST4A-4 differed slightly,
with 20 cm of mottled reddish yellow loamy sand and strong brown sandy clay. B horizon soils
were sandy loam/clay with some mottling; colors were red to yellow and brown to gray. None of
the STs recovered cultural materials; one shard of modern clear glass was found in ST4A-6 near
the road. There was no existing bridge in this study area; there were, however, galvanized metal
culverts. No cultural resources were visible from Proposed Bridge 4A (Figure B-4) or on aerial
photographs within the 300-ft visual APE (Figure 9). After the cultural resources survey, it was
determined that this bridge will not be affected by the project.

Study Area 8 (Bridge-Not Affected)
The majority of this study area crossed through pastures, with a small section in the southwest
cutting through a field and the drainages being bordered by woodland. Existing Bridge 8 crosses
Honey Grove Creek (Figure 11). A total of eight STs were excavated throughout this proposed
study area. Generally, the A horizons of these STs were 18-60 cm thick with very dark grayish
brown to olive yellow clay loam/clay soils. These were underlain by B horizon clay/sandy clay
loam soils (dark reddish/yellowish brown, light gray, and strong brown). All except ST8-5,
which encountered a modern brick fragment from 0-10 cmbs, were devoid of cultural materials.
Existing Bridge 8 was built in 2014 (Appendix A). No cultural resources were visible from
Proposed Bridge 8 (Figure B-5) or on aerial photographs within the 300-ft visual APE (Figure
11). After the cultural resources survey, it was determined that this bridge will not be affected by
the project.
Study Area 8A (Bridge)
Existing Bridge 8A crosses over Allens Creek. Between wooded areas in the northwest section,
the study area crossed a few plowed fields with 60-percent ground visibility; no STs were
excavated in these fields (Figure 11). A total of nine STs were excavated throughout the
proposed study area. The A horizons of these STs were 15-55 cm thick with black/ very dark
grayish brown to olive brown, loam to silty clay soils, underlain by clay B horizons (some
mottling: yellowish red/brown, olive brown, dark gray). No artifacts or features were found in
the STs or on the surface in this study area. Existing Bridge 8A was built in 1982 (Appendix A).
No cultural resources were visible from Proposed Bridge 8A (Figure B-6) or on aerial
photographs within the 300-ft visual APE (Figure 11).
Study Area 12 (Culvert)
The majority of the study area is wooded, with a few areas crossing through pastures; it also
crosses a 1st-order intermittent tributary of Yoakum Creek (Figure 12). A total of 18 STs, were
excavated throughout this proposed study area. The A horizons of these STs were 5-48 cm thick
and consisted of very dark grayish brown to light yellowish brown soils. B horizon soils were
mottled sandy clay/clay comprised of a variety of colors (yellowish/grayish/olive/strong brown
and red). Modern items, including a plastic button and clear glass shard, were recovered from
ST12-4 at 10-20 cmbs. Nothing was encountered in any of the other 17 STs. One Coke bottle
(IO1) was found on the surface (Appendix D). This bottle was produced between 1937 and 1951
(Lockhart and Porter 2010). The bottle was found along the edge of FM1396 and was not
associated with any other artifacts or features (Figure 12). There was no existing bridge in this
study area and no cultural resources were visible from Proposed Culvert 12 (Figure B-7) or on
aerial photographs within the 300-ft visual APE (Figure 12).
Study Area 13 (Bridge)
The study area crosses over Yoakum Creek and a two-track road runs along the center of this
study area (Figure 12). The eastern end of the study area is mostly in a pasture setting. The
western two-thirds is lightly wooded; erosion in the southwestern end resulted in 100 percent
ground visibility with no need to shovel test the last 150 meters on the south side of the county

road. A total of 11 STs were excavated throughout this proposed study area. The A horizons of
these STs were 14-60 cm thick and consisted of dark grayish brown, loamy sand to silty clay.
Dark grayish brown/ yellowish brown to light olive brown mottled clay B horizons underlay the
topsoil. No artifacts or features were found in the STs or on the surface in this study area. There
is no existing bridge in this study area; however, there are galvanized metal culverts. The aerial
photograph shows a small cluster of trees northeast of the proposed bridge that was suspected of
containing a structure; investigation of this area during survey found only a modern trash pile.
No cultural resources were visible from Proposed Bridge 13 (Figure B-8) within the 300-ft visual
APE (Figure 12).

Study Area 22 (Bridge)
The Onstott Creek crossing of the Proposed Bridge 22 study area is wooded, but otherwise the
study area crosses fields (Figure 13). A total of 15 STs were excavated in the proposed study
area and exposed 19-85 cm of very dark grayish brown to black clay loam A horizons that were
underlain by mottled dark grayish brown/black to strong brown/reddish yellow soils. A clear
glass bottle base embossed with “MFG. CO/SAND SPRING OKLA/AUG 1915” (IO2) was
found on the surface (Appendix D). This was likely from a Kerr fruit canning jar dating from the
early 1900s (Whitten 2014). ST22-13 was excavated nearby, but did not reveal artifacts. No
other artifacts were found in this study area. Existing Bridge 22 is a steel stringer/multibeam/girder bridge that was built in 1968. In 2012, the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation exempted this type of bridge from case-by-case review (Appendix A). No cultural
resources were visible from Proposed Bridge 22 (Figure B-9) or on aerial photographs within the
300-ft visual APE (Figure 13).
Study Area 23 (Bridge)
Most of the study area is wooded, but the southern end is in pasture. Existing Bridge 23 crosses a
1st-order intermittent tributary of Bois d’Arc Creek (Figure 13). Nine STs were excavated in this
study area. A horizon soils were 15- to 115-cm-thick, very dark grayish brown silty loam/clay.
These were underlain by clay subsoil (some mottled) that ranged from dark gray to yellowish
red. No artifacts or features were found in the STs or on the surface in this study area. Existing
Bridge 23 was built in 1991 (Appendix A). No cultural resources were visible from Proposed
Bridge 23 (Figure B-10) or on aerial photographs within the 300-ft visual APE (Figure 13).
Study Area 27 (Culverts)
The northern section of this study area is mostly wooded; the remaining portion passes through a
field and pastures (Figure 14). Ground visibility in this field was 90 percent and disturbances
were so deep, that subsoil was frequently exposed (Figure 15); no STs were excavated in this
disturbed field. Proposed Culverts 1 and 2 cross the same 1st-order tributary of Thomas Branch
330 m north of where it connects with the main creek drainage. Proposed Culvert 27-3 crosses a
2nd-order intermittent tributary of Thomas Branch 170 m north of where they converge, and
Proposed Culvert 27-4 crosses Thomas Branch where it is a 1st-order intermittent stream. A total
of 47 STs were excavated throughout this proposed study area. In STs placed along the wooded,
northern portion of the study area, the A horizons were 4-45 cm thick, very dark
grayish/yellowish brown and black clay loam that were underlain by mottled clay subsoil in a
variety of colors. In the southern fields and pastures, the A horizons were generally 8-50 cm
thick, though ST27-39, placed on a knoll, reached subsoil at 70-cmbs. These soils were
comprised of dark yellowish/grayish brown silty sand/loam soils and underlain by mottled clay
subsoil in a variety of colors. At the southern end of the study area, two structures lay just
outside of the survey corridor (Figure 16 and Figure 17). To ensure related artifact scatters were
not within the survey corridor, STs were placed as close to the structures as possible while
remaining in the study corridor and the corridor was walked in transects spaced 5 m apart. No
artifacts or features were found in the STs or on the surface in this study area. There are no
existing bridges in this study area; however, there are galvanized metal culverts along the portion
of CR 2625 bypassed by the proposed roadway. No cultural resources were visible from

Site Descriptions
41FN253
This site is located within Study Areas 2 and 3, southeast of the intersection of CR 2610 and CR
2680. It sits in upland pasture with 0-30 percent ground visibility. It consists of a cluster of five
structures: a house, a barn, a garage, and two outbuildings, which constitute a historic farmstead.
The house is a gable-front structure facing north toward CR 2610 (Figure 18). It measures
approximately 50 ft N/S by 35 ft E/W. The northernmost 8-10 ft of the house’s footprint is a
gabled addition split between an enclosed room on the west and a covered porch on the east. A
second gabled addition has been built off the back of the house (Figure 19). This addition
encompasses the northernmost 12 ft of the house’s footprint, and consists of one or two enclosed
rooms and a roofed back porch. The house is clad in a veneer of asbestos siding and is roofed
with asphalt shingles. There are no gaps in the siding, so it was impossible to determine whether
an original wood veneer was present beneath it. Wooden beadboard paneling is present on the
front porch ceiling, so in all likelihood the house was once clad in wooden siding. The house sits
on a pier-and-beam foundation, which is skirted with sheet metal pressed to resemble clapboard
siding. All windows seem fairly modern, with metal sashes and frames; these are likely modern
replacements for the original windows, which were probably wooden.

Approximately 25 ft east of the house is a 25 ft E/W by 20 ft N/S garage, that sits at the south
end of a 90-ft-long, paved driveway (Figure 20). This structure’s frame and rafters are composed
of 2x4s. It is clad in asbestos siding, which appears similar to that on the house; this siding has

come away in places, revealing horizontal shiplap siding composed of 1x8s. Its gabled roof,
which features exposed rafter ends, is covered with sheet metal pressed to resemble board and
batten siding. The garage’s door faces north toward the driveway and is wide enough to
accommodate two vehicles.

Figure 20.

The garage at site 41FN253. View is to the southwest.

A 70 ft E/W by 30 ft N/S barn is located approximately 125 ft south of the house (Figure 21).
The structure is composed of two N/S-oriented, enclosed rooms separated by a central open hall,
with two shed additions on either side. The enclosed rooms likely constitute the oldest part of the
structure and are framed with 2x6 studs and rafters, as well as some log support poles. The walls
are composed of 1x12s laid to form vertical shiplap siding (Figure 22). Near the tops of the
exterior walls in the enclosed rooms are square doors/windows measuring 1.5-2-ft; their purpose
could not be determined, as they do not connect to a loft within the enclosed rooms or sheds.
While the shed additions on the east and west sides of the barn may have once been open, the
entire exterior of the barn is clad in corrugated sheet metal, as is the gabled roof. Wooden doors
are present on the barn’s north face to allow access to the enclosed rooms, shed additions, and a
hay loft over the central hall. North of the barn is a large barnyard, where several pieces of
agricultural equipment are present, including brush hogs, two watering troughs formed from a
large-diameter metal pipe, and an elevated gas tank (Figure 23).
Two outbuildings are located between the barn and house. The larger of the two is roughly cattycorner from the barn, about 10 ft to the east. Measuring approximately 30 ft N/S by 25 ft E/W,
the building is framed with 2x4 studs and rafters, with 4x4 support beams at each corner. Its
exterior walls are clad in corrugated sheet metal, much like the barn (Figure 24). Its gabled roof
is clad in sheet metal similar to that on the garage. The building’s south face features a sliding
wooden door, big enough to allow a vehicle to enter, on its eastern half and a smaller, hinged
wooden door on its western half. A short paved driveway and stoop have been poured adjacent to

the doors. The second outbuilding is a much smaller shed about 30 ft south of the house (Figure
25). It is a side-gabled structure measuring approximately 15 ft E/W by 12 ft N/S, with hinged
wooden doors on both its north and south faces. Its framing was almost identical to that of the
outbuilding farther south.

A total of 13 STs, four of which encountered historic artifacts or features, were excavated at site
41FN253 (Figure 26). ST2-2 exposed an amber glass vessel shard; ST2-3 exposed two brick
fragments; ST2-5 exposed a clear glass bottle finish; ST2-6 exposed a concrete feature (Table 3).
The concrete feature found in ST2-6 was a circular shaft with a diameter of 2.5 ft; the rim was
about 1.5 in thick (Figure 27). While the purpose of this feature is unknown, it may have been a
septic tank, given its location about 45 ft west of the house.

South-facing view of the northernmost outbuilding at site 41FN253.

A structure was mapped in this general location on the 1939 Fannin County soils map and on the
1958 Bonham, TX 15’ USGS map. Structures generally conforming to those found during
survey are shown on aerial photographs from 1950, 1955, and 1976. Based on these images, it
would appear that this site dates to the early 20th century.
Deeds research was able to trace ownership of the property in which 41FN253 resides back to
1886, when R.T. Hunter sold his land to William Starnes (Fannin County Deeds Book [FCDB]
25:31). The property stayed in his possession until his death in 1899, when it was sold in a
partition deed to H. L. Walker (FCDB 70:473). In 1902, the deed was acquired by W. J. Hill
(FCDB 83:113), who then sold it to T.F. Goodman in 1911 (FCDB 124:171). Goodman only
possessed the property for a year before selling it back to H. L. Walker in 1912. The property
stayed in the possession of the Walker family, passing between five different family members
(FCDB 269:233; FCDB 556:168; FCDB 782:231; FCDB 819:98; FCDB 1071:227), before
being bought by the North Texas Municipal Water District in 2013 (FCDB 1653:46), who still
owned the property at the time of survey. All previous property owners were searched for on the
Texas State Historical Association’s Handbook of Texas Online. None of the owners have
entries on the site or are referenced in other entries.
This site appears to be in reasonably good condition, although the barn and house have likely
been significantly modified over time. In assessing the site’s potential significance, four criteria
were considered. The property cannot be tied to any significant individuals or events (36 CFR
60.4a-b). The structures and features at the site do not represent unique construction forms or the
work of a master (36 CFR 60.4c). Finally, it is unlikely the site holds any further potential to
provide insight into past lifeways (36 CFR 60.4d). As such, site 41FN253 is recommended not
eligible for listing on the NRHP or for designation as a SAL.

41FN254
This multicomponent site consists of a 20th-century house site and a sparse, subsurface scatter of
prehistoric lithic debitage and ceramics; it is located approximately 40 m southwest of 41FN253,
just west of CR 2610. The southern portion of the site is located in a manicured yard; the
northern portion is within an expanse of pasture dominated by knee- to waist-high weedy growth
(Figure 28). Ground visibility was generally below 30 percent, although exposures were
common, especially in the pasture, the surface of which was somewhat eroded. A total of 16 STs,
five of which encountered artifacts, were used to define the extent of the prehistoric component
(Figure 29). ST2-16 exposed two chert secondary flakes; ST2-19 exposed a 9.5-mm-thick, bonetempered, utility ware ceramic sherd and a secondary chert flake; ST2-23 exposed one interior
chert flake; ST2-25 exposed one secondary chert flake and one clear glass shard; ST2-26
exposed one secondary quartzite chip (Appendix D). Artifacts were encountered between 20 and
60 cmbs.

It is likely that this scant prehistoric deposit is what remains of a site that Jacob Davis, a local
collector, reported to ARC after the initial survey of the Lower Bois d’Arc Creek Reservoir in
2011 (Davis et al 2014:239-240). Mr. Davis reported that numerous pieces of lithic debitage, at
least one prehistoric pot sherd, and a Gary dart point had been observed at the site. ARC
submitted the reported site location to TARL, based on Davis’ description; the trinomial
41FN140 was issued for the site. When ARC conducted another round of survey at the reservoir
in 2013, the site location was revisited and nine STs were conducted to test for the site’s
existence and determine its limits. None encountered cultural resources. These covered an area
within and just west of the Bridge 2 study area and south of ST2-19 (Figure 29). Based on the
negative results of the work done in 2013, TARL deleted the site from TASA and the site
number was retired. With the results of this survey, the prehistoric deposit has been recorded as
site 41FN254.
Based on the assemblage found in STs, it is likely that the prehistoric component of this site
constitutes the ephemeral remains of a small, likely Late Prehistoric camp on the sandy terrace
sediments overlooking Sandy Branch to the west and Timber Creek to the south. The site deposit
was almost certainly more extensive in the past, with diagnostic artifacts (according to Mr.
Davis) present in the assemblage. However, area residents have likely collected many of the
more significant artifacts from the site over the years.
The historic component of site 41FN254 consists of a historic house. The house is not visible on
aerial photographs from 1950 and 1955, but does show on aerials from 1976. The current
occupants contend that the house is between 50 and 60 years old, so it was likely constructed
shortly after 1955. It measures approximately 60 ft N/S by 33 ft E/W. The central part of the
structure is a 26 ft N/S by 32 ft E/W, side-gabled portion of the house that features doors on its
east and south faces (Figure 30). A chimney composed of commercially-fired bricks is present
on the southern wall of this portion of the house. The northernmost 14 ft of the house’s footprint
is taken up by two rooms off the north edge of the side-gabled area. This likely constitutes a later
addition, although the house’s occupants were unsure if this was the case. The westernmost of
these rooms features a gabled roof, the spine of which runs north along the same orientation as
the central portion of the house. The eastern room features an east-facing gabled roof, which
projects toward CR 2610, giving the house the appearance of having an L-plan configuration.
The southernmost 20 ft of the house’s footprint is taken up by a covered porch, which is also
likely a later addition to the structure (Figure 31). The porch features a 10-ft-long wing wall
contiguous with the west face of the house. The porch is framed with 2x4 lumber, but has metal
support poles set in its poured concrete floor. The south face of the roof is finished in wooden
clapboard siding. The exterior of the house is clad in asphalt siding that features a woodgrain
design; asphalt shingles clad the roofs. While the asphalt siding is almost certainly not the
house’s original siding, there are no gaps through which the original siding could be observed.
The house’s pier-and-beam foundation is skirted with both sheet metal and plywood, to which
the asphalt siding has been affixed in places. A modern shed is located approximately 75 m north
of the house (Figure 32).

The first deed transaction found for the property containing site 41FN254 was between the heirs
of Thomas Cowart and John Whitley in 1886 (FCDB 25:30). Thomas Cowart was likely the first
Anglo-American to live on the property, as the survey of the land bears his name. Although the
original documentation could not be located, a subsequent warranty deed mentions that at some
point, ownership of the property passed from John Whitley to his son, Dick C. Whitley (FCDB

255:712). Upon Dick Whitley’s death in 1943, the property was sold by his wife Eva to S.R.
Echols (FCDB 255:712). S.R. Echols and his wife Cloma owned the property for 58 years,
before selling it to Penny Pannell in 2001, shortly after the death of S.R. (FCDB 944:459).
Pannell was in possession of the property for eight years, until it was bought by the North Texas
Municipal Water District in 2009 (FCDB 1459:552), who were the owners of the land at the time
of survey. All previous property owners were searched for on the Texas State Historical
Association’s Handbook of Texas Online. None of the owners have entries on the site or are
referenced in other entries.

The prehistoric component of this site is in fairly poor condition, having been subjected to
collection by local residents and impacted by erosion of the sandy topsoil. Given its sparse
artifact assemblage and apparent lack of features, this component holds very little potential to
provide insight on prehistoric lifeways or environments (36 CFR 60.4d). The historic component
is in somewhat better condition, but numerous alterations and additions to the house have
severely impacted its integrity. Because the site has no known association with significant events
or persons (36 CFR 60.4a-b), does not constitute the work of a master or an example of unique
architecture (36 CFR 60.4c), and has quite limited potential to provide insight into historic
lifeways (36 CFR 60.4d), site 41FN254 is recommended not eligible for listing on the NRHP or
as a SAL.

41FN255
This site is a historic house site located south of CR 2680, approximately 200 m from the
western end of the Bridge 3 study area. This site is located in a residential lawn where ground
visibility is typically below 30 percent. As was the case at site 41FN254, the house at this site
consists of a historic component that was added onto in the decades after its construction. The
oldest component of this house is a double-cell-plan structure with a hipped roof, which
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF FANNIN COUNTY BRIDGES

measures approximately 30 ft N/S by 18 ft E/W (Figure 33). Originally, the front door of this
house was likely on the east face of the northernmost room. However, a two-room gabled
addition was built onto the east side of the original component; the front door enters into the
westernmost of these rooms. A covered porch was built onto the north face of this addition; an
open back porch was built onto its south face, in the corner where the addition joins the original
house (Figure 34). Finally, a shed-style addition has been built onto the south face of the original
house.
Mr. J. Lee Pearson, the current landowner, indicated that he and his sons had built these
additions in the 1970s (Personal communication 2017). He was not sure when the original house
was constructed; the Fannin County Appraisal District (FCAD) gives a construction date of 1950
for the main area of the house. This date is at odds with aerial photography from 1955, which
shows that no house stood in this location at that time. The first depiction of this house on aerial
photographs dates to 1976. The house’s exterior is clad in asbestos siding; the roof is covered
with asphalt shingles. Its pier and beam foundation is skirted with corrugated sheet metal.
Approximately 15 ft east of the house is a modern metal storage building; FCAD lists its
construction date as 2007. STs 3-14 through 3-17 were excavated around the house; all were
negative (Figure 35).
The deed record for this house is closely tied to that of the property in which site 41FN254 is
located. Prior to 1943, it would seem that this property (Fannin County Parcel [FCP] 73391) was
part of the site 41FN254 property (FCP 73390), which was purchased by S.R. and Cloma Echols
in 1943 from Eva Whitley (FCDB 255:712). J. Lee Pearson, who still owns the property, and his
wife Bonnie Jean, purchased this portion of the property in 1965 from the Echols (FCDB
479:542). A search for the Pearsons on the Handbook of Texas Online returned no results.

This site is in relatively good overall condition, but the abundant additions to the house have
limited its integrity. Research demonstrates that the site property is not associated with
noteworthy people or events (36 CFR 60.4a-b). As much as can be determined from its heavily
altered form, the house does not appear to constitute an example of unique construction form or
the work of a master craftsman (36 CFR 60.4c). Finally, it likely has limited to no potential to
provide meaningful insights into past lifeways or environments (36 CFR 60.4d). As such, site
41FN255 is recommended as ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP or as a SAL.

41FN256
This site is located in the Bridge 3 study area, south of CR 2680, approximately 150 m east of
site 41FN255 on the same property (Figure 35). The site is within the 300-ft-wide visual APE for
Proposed Bridge 3. The barn is clearly visible from Existing Bridge 3 (Figure B-3). Located in
improved pasture with ground visibility of 20-30 percent, the site consists of a pole barn that
measures approximately 28 ft E/W by 20 ft N/S (Figure 36). The structure’s frame and rafters are
composed of 2x4s, with log support poles, likely pine, at each corner. The exterior is clad in
vertical wooden shiplap siding (1x8s) and covered with a veneer of corrugated sheet metal, as is
the roof. Double doors, which open wide enough for a vehicle to enter, are present on the
structure’s south face. The easternmost 8 ft of the barn’s footprint is taken up by a shed-style
addition. While the addition’s east and north walls are enclosed, its south face is open; this area
is currently used for storage. The barn sits on the northern edge of a 130 ft E/W by 70 ft N/S
fenced barnyard (Figure 37). Three STs were excavated around the structure (3-7, -8, and -9); all
were negative (Figure 35).

Figure 36.

The barn constituting site 41FN256. View is to the north.

The site 41FN256 barn is located on the same property as the house that constitutes site
41FN255, which is currently owned by J. Lee Pearson. Indeed a two-track road, which crosses
Sandy Branch, serves to connect to two structures. Like the house at site 41FN255, the barn does
not show on aerial photographs until 1976. The barn was recorded as historic site 41FN256
largely based on its inferred association with the site 41FN256 house.
As discussed in the 41FN255 site description, this property has no known association with
significant individuals or events (36 CFR 60.4a-b). It also does not represent a unique form of
construction or the work of a master (36 CFR 60.4c). Finally, it too is very unlikely to offer
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

insights into past lifeways or environments (36 CFR 60.4d). Accordingly, site 41FN256 is
recommended as not eligible for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL. Though the site is in the
visual APE for Proposed Bridge 3, the site is not recommended eligible for the NRHP, and,
therefore, is not a historic property that could be indirectly impacted by the new bridge.

This site is located west of CR 2610, approximately 80 m from the southern end of the Bridge 2
study area, and consists of a historic house site. The site is located in a maintained lawn, with
ground visibility of 20-30 percent. A structure is shown in this location as early as 1939, when it
was depicted on the FCSM. By 1955, an outbuilding had been built approximately 100 ft
northwest of the main structure, according to an aerial photograph from that time. Three
buildings are present at the site today: a house and a partially-collapsed shed to the northwest,
which are almost certainly the structures shown on the 1955 aerial, and a modern garage south of
the house.

The house is large, measuring approximately 60 ft E/W by 35 ft N/S. It is a front-gable structure
that faces east toward CR 2610; an 8-ft-by-20-ft porch, which is covered by a gabled roof,
dominates the east face of the structure (Figure 38). The westernmost 14 ft of the house is made
up of two additions, which likely add two rooms to that side of the house. The northern of these
additions features a hipped roof (Figure 39), while the southern addition features a gabled roof,
with a shed-style roof affixed to its south face that covers a concrete-floored porch (Figure 40).
The entire house is clad in modern vinyl siding. Storm windows have been placed over the
house’s original windows. These consist of single-paned wooden sashes within wooden frames
that feature sash pulleys. FCAD lists an improvement date for the house of 1987, which is
probably when these updates were made. Brown asphalt shingles cover the house’s roof.
A concrete walkway connects the house’s southern porch to a modern garage south of the house.
South of the garage is a concrete storm cellar, which sits beneath a large juniper tree (Figure 41).
The cellar is approximately 8 ft E/W by 6 ft N/S, with a corrugated metal door covering the
stairs. The outbuilding seen on historic aerial photography at this site appears to be a timberframed shed clad in vertical shiplap siding and roofed with corrugated metal, which sits beneath
an old oak tree approximately 100 ft northeast of the house (Figure 42). Since this shed was
outside the Bridge 2 study area, it was only visually inspected from the study area’s western
edge.
Six STs (2-45 through 2-51) were excavated at site 41FN257 (Figure 43). Only one, ST2-47,
encountered cultural material. This was a piece of curved metal found in the top 10 cm. Several
ornate plant pots with similar metalwork were seen on the north side of the house. It may be that
the metal came from one of these or a similar item. No STs were placed outside the Bridge 2
Study Area, because the site is located on private property. As such, site 41FN257 constitutes the
only site that was not fully recorded during this survey. The shed was an obvious feature
adjacent to the site; the extent of the site’s subsurface component outside the study area could not
be estimated.
Ownership of the site 41FN257 property can be traced back to 1887, when J. R. Dement
purchased it from J. B. Mauer (FCDB 24:456). Two years later in 1889, Dement sold the
property to W. N. Duncan (FCDB 71:531), who then sold it to Joe G. Peevey in 1899 (FCDB
75:88). Peevey retained the property for 15 years, which was then bought by A. A. Campbell
(FCDB 135:206). Campbell sold the property to C. F. Henry in 1919 (FCDB 157:54), who then
shortly sold it to J. R. Fairchild in 1921 (158:569). J. R. Fairchild was only in possession of the
property for about a year, selling it to W. W. Fitzwater on December 5, 1922 (FCDB 179:85).
The property stayed within the Fitzwater family for 65 years (FCDB 349:506; FCDB 658:652),
until it was sold to Melanie Mincey in 1987 (FCDB 697:715), who was the current owner of the
property at the time of survey. A search of the Handbook of Texas Online returned no entries
about the named property owners. However, this search did reveal that a man named M.W.
Fitzwater led the Farm Labor Union out of Bonham in the 1920s (Brown 2010). With a multistate membership that numbered 160,000 at its height, this union agitated for better pay and
working conditions for tenant farmers and laborers. By the late-1920s, the organization was in
decline. It is unknown what association existed between M.W. Fitzwater and W.W. Fitzwater,
although they were likely related.

As was the case at all historic sites recorded during this survey, this site is in relatively good
condition, but the house has been substantially modified over the past few decades. Deeds
research shows that at least one previous owner (W.W. Fitzwater) may have been related to
M.W. Fitzwater, a figure of minor note in an early-20th-century labor movement. However, this
relationship could not be confirmed. Even if it had, such an association is quite tentative. As
such, the site appears to have no ties to significant individuals or events (36 CFR 60.4a-b). The

house and associated outbuildings and features, while potentially quite old, do not constitute the
work of a master craftsman or unique construction forms (36 CFR 60.4c). Finally, the site
appears to have little potential to provide insight into past lifeways or environments (36 CFR
60.4d). Based on these criteria, the portion of site 41FN257 that is within the project area is
recommended as not eligible for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF FANNIN COUNTY BRIDGES

Conclusions
Survey of the proposed bridge and roadway improvement areas within the footprint of the
proposed Lower Bois d’Arc Creek Reservoir resulted in the recording of five historic
archaeological sites (41FN253 through 41FN257), one of which (41FN254) also had a
prehistoric component. These results generally conform with the results of survey within the
proposed reservoir and the larger Bois d’Arc Creek watershed (Davis et al. 2014). The only
prehistoric resources were found on a terrace overlooking the perennial Timber Creek floodplain,
a setting where several other prehistoric sites have been found within the watershed. The historic
sites all generally correspond to the locations of structures shown on historic maps of Fannin
County.
The historic sites largely consist of standing structures and all appear to date to the 20th century.
The structures are generally in fairly good condition; however, in most cases their integrity has
been impacted to some degree by alterations and additions of varying significance. This was
most evident in the cases of the houses, where present. Shovel testing around the structures
revealed that all five sites had sparse or non-existent subsurface deposits, although this
investigation method did uncover a below-ground concrete feature, likely a septic feature, at site
41FN253.
The prehistoric component at site 41FN254 is quite sparse, perhaps indicating that it marks a
short-term occupation along Timber Creek. It is likely, however, that the site deposit was more
extensive in the past. Erosion of the area’s topsoil and the activities of local collectors have
probably contributed to the slow depletion of the site’s assemblage and integrity.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present in
the proposed bridge improvement areas within the Lower Bois d’Arc Creek Reservoir footprint
in Fannin County, Texas. Five archaeological sites were documented in the course of this
investigation. Based on the site assemblages and archival research conducted before, during, and
after field work, ARC has made several conclusions about these sites in regards to their
eligibility for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL. None of the historic sites were found to have any
known link to notable historical events or personages (36 CFR 60.4a-b). The structures and
features at the historic sites were not examples of unique architectural forms and were not works
of a master craftsman (36 CFR 60.4c). Finally, none of the sites exhibit much potential to offer
significant insights into past lifeways or environments (36 CFR 60.4d). Accordingly, ARC
recommends that sites 41FN253-256 are not eligible for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL (Table
7). However, site 41FN257 is partially within the project area and partially outside of it on
private land; the portion on private land was not recorded. ARC recommends that site 41FN257
is not eligible within the project area.
Based on the results of the survey, ARC concludes that further cultural resource investigations
for this project are unwarranted, and recommends that the THC concur with this assessment.
This recommendation is contingent on the entirety of the project’s construction activities being
limited to the proposed Study Areas. Finally, ARC recommends that if buried cultural materials
are discovered during construction, the Archeology Division of the THC should be notified to
assess the significance of the find.
