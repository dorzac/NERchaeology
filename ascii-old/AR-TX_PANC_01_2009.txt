ABSTRACT
In September 2009, Panamerican Consultants, Inc. (Panamerican) of Memphis, Tennessee,
conducted an intensive remote sensing survey of the proposed Ship Dock #4, located in the
Houston Ship Channel at the confluence of Buffalo and Carpenter Bayous in Harris County,
Texas. Performed for the Houston Fuel Oil Terminal Company, under Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 5400, the purpose of the survey was to determine the absence/presence of magnetic and
sidescan sonar targets that may represent potentially significant submerged cultural resources
eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) that might be impacted by
the proposed undertaking.
Results of the current remote sensing survey identified a total of thirteen (n=13) magnetic
anomalies and twenty (n=20) sidescan sonar targets were recorded in the survey corridor,
including cables and a partially exposed pipeline, which runs the length of the project area. The
sources for all but two anomalies were visible on the surface (i.e., sheet pile, mooring buoys,
etc.) and/or were readily visible on the sidescan record (i.e., pipelines, cables, etc.). Of the 13
anomalies, 11 represent visible pipelines and/or cables, and it is thought that the source for the
other two is also a pipeline. All anomalies are considered to represent non-historic manmade
structures, and no further work is warranted. However, undetected submerged cultural resources
may exist in the survey area, particularly small but potentially significant watercraft. If such
resources are discovered during the project, work must stop at the location until the THC has
been notified and a plan of investigation is undertaken.

1. INTRODUCTION
In September 2009, Panamerican Consultants, Inc. of Memphis, Tennessee, conducted an
intensive remote sensing survey of the proposed Ship Dock #4, located in the Houston Ship
Channel at the confluence of Buffalo and Carpenter Bayous in Harris County, Texas (Figure 1).
Performed for Houston Fuel Oil Terminal Company, the total project area was approximately
250-x-1,500 feet. The purpose of the survey was to identify the potential for any historically
significant resources, which might be impacted by the construction of the proposed undertaking.
The THC considers it highly probable for the area to contain historic shipwrecks and other
anomalies significant enough to be eligible for inclusion into the NRHP. As indicated by an
aerial map in Figure 2 six survey lines were required to fully cover entire project area (Figure 2).

Introduction

The survey was conducted for the Houston Fuel Oil Terminal Company of Houston, Texas,
relative to their responsibilities under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act; this
investigation was performed in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended (36 CFR 800, Protection of Historic Properties)
and the Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987 (Abandoned Shipwreck Act Guidelines, National
Park Service, Federal Register, Vol. 55, No. 3, December 4, 1990, pages 50116-50145).
Completed under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5400, the purpose of the survey was to
determine the presence or absence of anomalies, representative of potentially significant
submerged cultural resources eligible for listing on the NRHP, which subsequently, might
require additional investigations. The remote sensing survey investigation consisted of a
magnetometer, sidescan sonar, and Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) to accurately
map above and below-harbor bed features (i.e., modern debris, pipeline crossings, and
shipwrecks).
Results of the current remote sensing survey identified a total of thirteen (n=13) magnetic
anomalies and twenty (n=20) sidescan sonar targets were recorded in the survey corridor,
including cables and a partially exposed pipeline that runs the length of the project area. The
sources for all but two anomalies were visible on the surface (i.e., sheet pile, mooring buoys,
etc.) and/or were readily visible on the sidescan record (i.e., pipelines, cables, etc.). Of the 13
anomalies, 11 represent visible pipelines and or cables, and it is thought that the source for the
other two is also a pipeline. All anomalies are considered to represent non-historic manmade
structures, and no further work is warranted. However, undetected submerged cultural resources
may exist in the survey area, particularly small but potentially significant watercraft. If such
resources are discovered during the project, work must stop at that location until the THC has
been notified and a plan of investigation is undertaken.

2. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Many people with different types of watercrafts have navigated the Galveston Bay, though few
have left behind tangible evidence of their presence. Fortunately, archaeologists have written
accounts and journals from the first Europeans to explore the coast, which are used in
conjuncture with the archaeological evidence. The following is a brief history of Galveston Bay,
its associated peoples, and the types of watercraft used in the bay.

GALVESTON BAY
Research indicates that Galveston Bay was carved out of the Texas coast approximately 100,000
years ago. Storms that occurred as early as 4,000 years ago are expected to have had a far
greater impact on the Galveston Bayâs shape than storms that had taken place in the last century.
In addition, sediment cores that penetrate beyond or just beneath the bay fill suggest that rapid
flooding may have occurred during the Holocene era (Proceedings of the Galveston Bay
Characterization Workshop, 1991).
Galveston Bay lies within Harris, Galveston, and Chambers counties. It is the largest estuary on
the Texas coast and the seventh largest in the United States. It extends 30 mi., south to north,
and 17 mi., east to west. The bay is generally 7 to 9 ft. deep, and it has a mud bottom and nearly
600 square miles of surface. Fresh water from the Trinity and the San Jacinto rivers mixes with
the salt water from the Gulf of Mexico through the channel between Galveston Island and the
Bolivar Peninsula, otherwise known as Bolivar Roads.
The Houston Ship Channel passes through Bolivar Roads, Galveston Bay, the San Jacinto River,
and Buffalo Bayou to the Port of Houston, which, in terms of tonnage, was the third largest U.S.
port during the 1980s. Between the island and neighboring Pelican Island runs the Galveston
Ship Channel, which formed a natural harbor for nineteenth-century sailing vessels and small
steamers. The gap between Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula offers the principal entrance
into Galveston Bay, while the San Luis Pass affords a smaller entryway at the islandâs western
end. Between 1817 and 1820, Galveston Bay provided the water connection for the illicit
smuggling and privateering activities of the Lafitte brothers. A steam ferry began operation to
the mainland in May of 1842. During the Civil War, the Battle of Galveston was fought on land,
along the wharf area and on the waters of the bay in December 1862 and January 1863.
Physical modifications associated with excavation and disposal of sediments are the single most
obvious manifestation of human impacts on Galveston Bay. By 1900, the federal government
had begun to dredge the Houston Ship Channel; it consisted of a 12-foot draft spanning
Galveston Bay, from the Bolivar inlet between the jetties, across the Red Fish Bar, through the
cut at Morganâs Point, and up Buffalo Bayou to the city of Houston. A new industry motivated
the next channel expansion: the appearance of oil tankers in the world fleet after World War I.
In close association with the development of the Houston Ship Channel was the creation of a
channel to Texas City (Hudson 1979).

VESSEL TYPES
The first type of watercraft to traverse Galveston Bay would have been dugout canoes employed
by the indigenous tribes such as the Karankawa Indians (Figure 3). They would take a large tree
trunk and hollow it out using a crude tool called an adze. The Indians would take hot coals and
place them on top of the tree trunk, then scraping and digging out the seared wood with the adze.

Historical Background

1988:18).

Underscoring the need for surveys in the bays of Texas, the recent discovery and excavation of
La Salleâs barque longue, La Belle, in the muddy waters of Matagorda Bay to the south of the
project area has provided archeologists with several missing links in the history of shipbuilding.
The ship is the oldest French colonial shipwreck found in the New World. The La Belleâs
construction took place during a transitional period in naval architecture, as shipbuilders
abandoned ancient methods for more modern ones. A study of the construction of the twomasted ship will be of great value to historians, since shipbuilders of La Salle's era rarely drew
plans, and most of the ships of the period have long since disintegrated. In August 1684, La
Salle departed with his fleet; La Belle, LâAimiable, Saint-Francois, and Le Joly with about 300
people and all the supplies needed to start the colony. La Belle, a barque longue or light frigate,
was a navy ship assigned to La Salle at Rochefort in 1683 for his exclusive use. She was
relatively small, only 51-x-14 ft., with a crew of 27. Archeologists believe that La Belle was
capable of carrying 45 tons of cargo. Loading the cargo was a science of its own, as faulty
loading could cause the ship to list or roll dangerously. La Belle was accompanied by the 180ton storeship, L'Aimable; a 34-gun man-of-war, Le Joly, which was to transport the colonists to
their new home, then return to France; and the ketch Saint-FranÃ§ois, carrying additional
supplies. On January 1, La Salleâs party made landfall on the Texas coast, over one hundred
miles from the mouth of the Mississippi. In addition to being lost, their supply ship, the
LâAimable, ran aground in the narrow channel at the mouth of the bay. When it sank, the group
lost nearly all of their food, medicine, Indian trades, and tools. Le Joly sailed back to France
with many disenchanted colonists. The La Belle, however, safely entered Matagorda Bay.
Roughly one year later, however, a storm ran the La Belle aground near the Matagorda Peninsula
(Weddle 2001).
The reliance of sailing ships on wind propulsion meant that boats were needed for many reasons:
carrying men ashore, moving the ship by means of cables and anchors, communicating between
5

Historical Background

ships (and between ship and shore), and bringing stores and water aboard. Several types of shipâs
boats were required, and each had a separate function or use. The largest boat was the launch
that was well adapted for carrying heavy weights. A barge was narrower, and often longer than a
launch, and was intended mainly for rowing. Moreover, it was also the preferred vessel for
carrying naval officers ashore and transferring official parties. A pinnace was slightly smaller
than a barge, and had fewer oars. Cutters were good sea boats, clinker built, and an
indispensable part of every shipâs equipment. Most shipâs boats were designed for both rowing
and sailing, though, in general, some were more suitable at one than the other. Pinnaces and
barges were used primarily for rowing, while cutters were better at sailing. Captains often added
other types of boats according to size and availability, which could include a jollyboat (which
was essentially a small cutter) and a gig. The larger boats were stored in the waist of the ship,
while cutters and jollyboats were stowed near, or suspended from the stern on davits, where they
could be released easily and quickly in the case of an emergency (Culver 1869).
Privateers were privately owned men-of-war, sponsored by merchants and allowed to seize
vessels and goods belonging to enemy nations. They were neither paid for, nor controlled by
their respective governments, though, if they possessed a âletter of marquee,â privateers could
operate within the protection of their nationâs legal system. Without a letter of marquee, a
privateer was merely a pirate vessel, and its crew, if captured, were liable to be hanged as pirates
rather than treated as prisoners of war.
The privateer Jean Lafitte arrived on Galveston Island in 1817, making it his base of operations
and naming it Campeche. Lafitteâs own mansion, the âMaison Rouge,â was half home, half fort.
Around it sprang the warehouses of trade, a slave quarters, cattle pens, taverns, and frame
cottages of his crew. His experience in setting up a smuggling operation engendered Lafitte to
make lucrative contracts on the east coast of Texas, through which he could transport his
contraband inland to growing towns that required provisioning. However, Lafitte slowly lost his
territory. Campeche was always under scrutiny from both Mexican and U.S. officials for the
behavior of the men. The Karankawa Indians were raiding Lafitteâs properties and killing his
men. In late 1818 a hurricane struck the island, killing hundreds of men, flattening the
settlement, sinking the fleet, and washing precious contraband to sea. During this time, the
nation was trying for a new diplomacy of peace. The only thing that stood in its way of
developing a friendship with Spain was the constant harassment of Spanish ships by buccaneers
anchored off the American coast (Elliot 1963). President Madison issued an all-out war on
piracy. In late 1820, the USS Enterprise docked in Campeche Bay. Following a subsequent
attack by Lafitte on an American ship, he was forced by Lieutenant Larry Kearney, accompanied
by a war fleet, to abandon his operations.
In 1836, four ships of the Texas Navy made headquarters on the Island and protected the Texas
coast from harassment by the Mexican Navy. These ships prevented supplies and men from
reaching Santa Anna, insuring victory for Sam Houstonâs army at San Jacinto, 22-miles
northwest of Galveston (McComb 1986).
Galveston was also an important harbor during the American Civil War. Major General John B.
Magruder, who became the Confederate commander of military forces in Texas on November
29, 1862, gave the recapture of Galveston top priority. At 3:00 a.m., on New Yearâs Day, 1863,
four Confederate gunboats appeared, coming down the bay toward Galveston. Soon afterward,
the Confederates commenced a land attack. The Union forces in Galveston were comprised of
companies in the 42nd Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment under the command of
Colonel Isaac S. Burrell. The Confederates captured or killed all of them except for the
regimentâs adjutant. They also took Harriet Lane, by boarding her, and two barks and a
schooner. Cdr. W.B. Renshawâs flagship, USS Westfield, ran aground when trying to help the
Harriet Lane, and, at 10:00 a.m., the ship was blown up to prevent its capture by the

6

Historical Background

Confederates. Galveston was in Confederate hands again, although the Union blockading ships
would limit commerce in and out of the harbor (Cumberland 1947).
In 1900, a hurricane made landfall in the vicinity of Galveston, which completely devastated the
area. Many fishing boats and barges, private yachts, and military vessels were broken upon the
shore or actually run aground, hundreds of feet from the shore; still, others were completely lost
(Cartwright 1991).
One of the most prolific vessel types employed in the waters of Texas including the waters of
Galveston Bay was the schooner. The majority of these vessels appear to have been small
schooners carrying cargo and/or passengers from port to port. Surviving descriptions of most are
meager (Figure 4). The early schooners carried settlers and their supplies to the towns and
farmlands of Texas at a time when roads were nearly nonexistent. During the Civil War years,
blockade runners (if they were successful) carried cotton out and everything from medicine to
luxury items into the beleaguered Confederate ports.
The schooners, and commercial sail in general, declined rapidly as the twentieth century
progressed, replaced by steamers and then by oil burners. Some of the late, very large schooners
lasted through the First World War and into the 1920s. One of these which ended her career in
Texas was the Delaware Sun, a 316-foot six-masted schooner of 3,708 tons, built in 1903, which
wrecked on the jetties at Sabine in 1917. As late as the beginning of the Second World War,
some commercial sail continued, as seen in the Gloria Colita, a schooner of 202 tons wrecked at
San Luis Pass in 1941 while carrying a cargo of sulfur (Berman 1972).

transshipment point of Galveston.

Historical Background

THE PORT OF HOUSTON
In 1837, the steamship Laura traveled from Galveston Bay up Buffalo Bayou to what is now
Houston. The trip, in water no deeper than six feet, proved the bayou was navigable by sizable
vessels and established a commercial link between Houston and the rest of the world. However,
it was not until the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 did the two proposed projects with the aim of
widening and deepening Galveston Bay and Buffalo Bayou, merge as the âGalveston Ship
Channel and Buffalo Bayou, Texas Project.â Progress, however, stalled due to the SpanishAmerican War but soon afterward found legislative support. While some ocean-going vessels
could deliver goods to Houston, adamant congressmen from 1896-1911 strongly advocated for
the expansion and deepening of the Houston Ship Channel in an effort to increase the volume
and safety of commercial traffic. Finally, funding was secured in 1911 and construction of the
Houston Ship Channel, which would eventually reach a depth of 25 feet, was completed ahead of
schedule in 1914. To memorialize this occasion, President Woodrow Wilson pressed a button in
Washington, D.C. that fired a canon located at the Port of Houston Turning Basin.
As a direct result, the city of Houston was born and her port has become one of the largest with
more than 7,000 ships calling annually bringing goods ranging from iron to sugar for U.S.
consumers. Ned Holmes, Chairman of the Port of Houston Authority described this simply when
he said, "Houston...the town that built the port which built the city...".
Since the initial completion of the Houston Ship Channel, the growth of the Port of Houston,
otherwise known as Allenâs Landing (Figure 5), has been facilitated by local contributions and
federal funds to gradually deepen and widen the channel even further. Currently, the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, with the Port of Houston Authority as a non-federal sponsor, are working to
deepen the channel to 45 ft. and widen it to 530 ft. (Houston Ship Channel 2004).

Historical Background

HISTORIC AND NAVIGATION MAP REVIEW
Navigation charts can be a valuable source of information, often-noting shipwrecks, obstructions,
and other various hazards for the mariner. One of the more valuable research tools for reviewing
historic maps online can be found at http://historicals.ncd.noaa.gov/historicals/histmap.asp. This
web site allows the researcher to specify the area or region of interest and then review all
available maps for that area. Another valuable utility provided by this site is the virtual
magnification feature, which allows the researcher to zoom in and out of specific areas.
The earliest historic map available for review (on the NOAA web site) of the current survey
corridor dates to 1933 and was produced by the U.S. Coast Survey (Figure 6). This map is
useful, since it provides detail of the changes to Carpenter Bayou. The project area, shown in
red, has been placed on the map relative to its current location with the San Jacinto Battleground
State Park (across the ship channel). While the project area is today at the mouth of Carpenter
Bayou, the map clearly shows the mouth much further down stream indicating a radical
morphology since 1933.

Figure 6. 1933 chart of Houston ship channel and project area (map source: 1933 NOAA Navigation Chart
âHouston Ship Channel,â No. 11329).

9

Historical Background

As stated the project area is located across the shipping channel from the San Jacinto
Battleground State Historic Site now the home of the Battleship Texas. The famous Battle of
San Jacinto that brought Texas its independence was fought on this site. Because of the great
importance of the Battle to the course of history, the Battleground is of state, national and
international significance, a fact that is attested to by the site's National Historic Landmark
status. The primary purpose of the 1,200 ac. site is to commemorate the Battle and to preserve
the Battleground on which Texan troops under General Sam Houston achieved the independence
of Texas by defeating a Mexican Army led by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna on April
21, 1836 (San Jacinto Historic Site 2008).
Illustrated in Figure 7, the 1976 navigation chart for the Houston Ship Channel shows Carpenter
Bayou has been channelized and is now cutoff. The mouth is now slightly upriver from the San
Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site. It appears that little industrial activity has occurred at
the project area.

Historical Map and Chart Collection/Office of Coast Survey/National Ocean Service/NOAA). Note the power
cables at the north end of the survey area. They are currently present and masked this portion of the area.

Compared to the 1976, the 1983 navigation chart for the Houston Ship Channel shows industrial
activity to the south of the survey area, with a fuel tank field in place (Figure 8).

Illustrated in Figure 9, the 1989 navigation chart for the Houston Ship Channel shows little
change from the 1983 edition. Note no wreck symbols are noted in the vicinity (Figure 9). The
1995 edition shows a similar lack of facilities along the shoreline. However, a âPipeline Areaâ
has now appeared within the project area. Note that several exposed pipelines were recorded
during the remote sensing survey of the area (Figure 10).

3. METHODS
PROJECT AREA ENVIRONMENT
The survey area is located at the confluence of Buffalo and Carpenters Bayous across from the
Battleship Texas (Figure 11). Water depths throughout the survey area average 10.5 ft. to 0
adjacent to shore.

Figure 11. Project area looking west (upstream). This mooring buoy is on the east end opposite a sheet-piling
wall. Note channel marker and white security area sign in background.

REMOTE SENSING SURVEY EQUIPMENT
The remote sensing survey was conducted with equipment and procedures intended to facilitate
the effective and efficient search for magnetic and/or sidescan sonar anomalies and to determine
their exact location. Belaire Environmental, Inc. of Rockport, Texas conducted the survey.
Panamerican and Belaire have an ongoing relationship with cultural resources surveys in Texas.
MARINE MAGNETOMETER SYSTEM
The remote sensing instrument used to search for ferrous objects on or below the bay floor of the
survey area was a Geometrics 882 marine magnetometer. The latest generation equipment with
very low noise and high sensitivity, the towed magnetometer sensor was interfaced with a
computer system via Chesapeake Technology, Inc. software that records the data digitally along
with position information from the GPS receiver (Figure 12).

14

Methods

SIDESCAN SONAR SYSTEM
A Marine Sonics Sidescan sonar system operating at 600 kHz was employed in order to record
an image of the sea floor and any items lying upon it. The sidescan sonar provides an aerial
photograph-type image of the sea floor on which features and objects can be clearly seen and
mapped. Similar to the magnetometer, the towed sidescan sonar is also interfaced with the
computer system via Chesapeake Technology, Inc. software that employs positioning data from
the DGPS system to locate the sidescan files and mosaics them in real time, on the fly. The final
product is a bitmap image in the GeoTiff or Tiff World File format, suitable for input to any
CAD or GIS system (see Figure 12).

Figure 12. Geometrics 882 marine magnetometer (top), and Marine Sonics Sidescan sonar system (bottom).

HORIZONTAL POSITIONING SYSTEM
Horizontal positioning for this project was achieved using a real time differential GPS Satellite
positioning system. GPS signals were received via a Trimble model ProXRT receiver and
utilized differential corrections from the OmniSTAR national differential system, resulting in
sub-meter horizontal position accuracy. Horizontal coordinates employed were in Texas State
Plane, NAD 1983 datum in U.S. survey feet.

DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM
Data from the horizontal positioning system, magnetometer, sidescan sonar, and fathometer were
taken into a notebook PC utilizing Chesapeake Technology, Inc. software. This software is
powerful, flexible, allows real time calculation of the vesselâs position and provides the
helmsman guidance information with respect to pre-programmed survey lines. This system
matches all recorded data with the correct horizontal position on the fly and records the data on
electronic media (Figure 13).

15

Methods

Although data is subject to extensive QC in the field in real time, it is usual practice to return
data to the office for final editing and generation of x-y-z data. This final editing and generation
of final x-y-z data was stored on IBM-PC compatible discs in an ASCII format suitable for
import into Bentley Microstation CAD software.

Figure 13. Data acquisition system utilizing Chesapeake Technology, Inc. software.

DEPTH MEASUREMENT
An Odom Hydrotrac Fathometer was employed for depth measurements. The Odom Hydrotrac
is a single frequency unit operating at 200 kHz via a transducer mounted to the stern of the boat.
The unit is capable of measuring down to approximately 2,000 ft. of water. In water less than 50
ft. deep, the measurement accuracy is better than 3 cm at a rate of approximately 15
measurements per second. The fathometer system was connected directly to the navigation
computer.
The fathometer was calibrated at the beginning and end of each survey day via a traditional barcheck in which a 3 in. diameter metal bar is lowered on chains beneath the boat and is marked at
increments of 5 feet. The chains are each lowered so that each mark is level with the water
surface, and held there while the controls on the fathometer are adjusted so that it reads exactly
the correct depth. The procedure was repeated at the end of each survey day to confirm the
calibration. All data was tied to a vertical datum via local benchmarks that could be referenced
back to NAVD 88 or NGVD 29 mean sea level.
SURVEY VESSEL
A 26-foot half-cuddy Carolina Skiff with a 130 Hp outboard engine was employed for the
duration of the survey (Figure 14). It was launched from the Rockport Beach boat launch.

SURVEY PROCEDURES
As illustrated in (Figure 15), a total of six transects, approximately 1,500 ft. in length and at a
maximum spacing of 65 ft. (20 m), were planned to adequately cover the proposed project area.
As indicated by (Figure 16), each trackline was run until completed. Any navigation errors,
problems with the remote sensing instruments or with the positioning system during the running
of a line, resulted in the termination of that run. Significant off-line errors in navigation resulted
in the immediate repetition of that line. Problems with remote sensing instruments were resolved
before repeating the run of an aborted line.

4. RESULTS
The survey of the proposed project area intended to locate and identify any potentially significant
submerged cultural resources that might be impacted by the construction of the proposed
undertaking. The survey was completed in an effort to locate those anomalies that may be
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
The interpretation of the remote sensing data obtained from both the magnetometer and sidescan
sonar is an imperfect process at best, and as stated by Pearson et al. (1991), interpretation ârelies
on a combination of sound scientific knowledge and practical experienceâ. The evaluation of
remote sensing anomalies with regard to a determination that the anomaly does or does not
represent shipwreck remains depends on a variety of factors, including detected characteristics of
the individual anomalies (e.g., magnetic anomaly strength and duration, sidescan image
configuration), associations with other sidescan or magnetic targets on the same or adjacent
lines, and relationships to observable target sources, such as channel buoys or pipeline crossings.
Interpretation of data collected by the magnetometer, the underwater archaeologistâs tool of
choice for locating shipwrecks, is perhaps the most problematic. Anomalies are evaluated and
prioritized based on magnetic amplitude or deflection of gamma intensity in concert with
duration or spatial extent; they are also correlated with sidescan targets. Since the sonar record
gives a visible indication of the target, identification or evaluation of potential significance is
based on visible target shape, size, and presence of structure and association with magnetic
anomalies. Targets such as isolated sections of pipe can normally be immediately discarded as
nonsignificant, while large areas of above-sediment wreckage are generally easy to identify.
The problems of differentiating between modern debris and shipwrecks based on remote sensing
data have been discussed by a number of authors. This difficulty is particularly true in the case
of magnetic data; therefore, it has received the most attention in the current body of literature
dealing with the subject. Pearson and Saltus (1990:32) state, âeven though a considerable body
of magnetic signature data for shipwrecks is now available, it is impossible to positively
associate any specific signature with a shipwreck or any other featureâ. There is no doubt that
the only positive way to verify a magnetic source object is via physical examination. However,
the size and complexity of a magnetic signature does provide a usable key for distinguishing
between modern debris and shipwreck remains (see also Garrison et al. 1989; Irion and Bond
1984; Pearson et al. 1993). Specifically, the magnetic signatures of most shipwrecks tend to be
large in area and tend to display multiple magnetic peaks of differing amplitude.
In a study for the Minerals Management Service of magnetic anomalies in the north Gulf of
Mexico, Garrison et al. (1989) indicate a shipwreck signature will cover an area between 10,00050,000 m2. Using Garrison et al.âs (1989) study and years of practical experience in an effort to
assess the potential significance of remote sensing targets in a riverine setting, Pearson et al.
(1991) developed general characteristics of magnetometer signatures most likely to represent
shipwrecks. The report states, âthe amplitude of magnetic anomalies associated with shipwrecks
vary considerably, but, in general, the signature of large watercraft, or portions of watercraft,
range from moderate to high intensity (>50 gammas) when the sensor is at distances of 20 ft. or
soâ (Pearson et al. 1991:70). Using a table of magnetic data from various sources as a baseline,
they state âdata suggest that at a distance of 20 ft. or less watercraft of moderate size are likely to
produce a magnetic anomaly (this would be a complex signature, i.e., a cluster of dipoles and/or
monopoles) greater than 80 or 90 ft. across the smallest dimensionâ (Pearson et al. 1991:70).
While establishing baseline amounts of amplitude and duration reflective of the magnetic
characteristics for a shipwreck site, the Pearson et al. report ârecognizes that a considerable
20

Results

amount of variability does occurâ (1991:70). Generated in an effort to test the 50-gamma/80foot criteria and determine amount of variability, Table 1 lists numerous shipwrecks as well as
single-and multiple-source objects that have been located by magnetic survey and verified by
divers. All of the shipwrecks meet and surpass the 50-gamma/80-foot criteria, while all singlesource object readings except the pipeline, fall below the criteria. However, the signature of the
pipeline should show up as a linear feature on a magnetic contour map and not be confused with
a single-source object. While the shipwrecks and single-source objects adhere to the 50gamma/80-foot criteria, the multiple-source objects do not. If all of the targets listed on the table
had to be prioritized according to potential significance based on the 50-gamma/80-foot criteria,
the two multiple-source object targets would have to be classified as potentially significant.

While the data indicates the validity of employing the 50-gamma/80-foot criteria when assessing
magnetic anomalies, other factors must also be taken into account. Pearson and Hudson (1990)
have argued that the past and recent use of a water body must be an important consideration in
the interpretation of remote sensing data, and in many cases, it should be the most important
criterion. Unless the remote sensing data, the historical record, or the specific environment (i.e.,
a harbor entrance channel) provides compelling and overriding evidence to the contrary, it is
believed that the history of use should be a main consideration in data interpretation. What
constitutes âcompelling evidenceâ is, to a certain degree, left to the discretion of the researcher.
However, in settings where both modern commercial traffic and historic use have been intensive,
the presence of a considerable quantity of modern debris must be anticipated. In harbor, bay, or
riverine situations where traffic is heavy, this debris will be scattered along the channel right-of21

Results

way, although it may be concentrated at areas where traffic would slow or halt, and the debris
will appear on the remote sensing survey records in the form of discrete, large or small objects.
With respect to the current project area, sheet piling, a pipeline, a navigational aid, two mooring
buoys and anchor, and electrical tower along with other structures are present in or adjacent to
the project area.

SURVEY RESULTS
MAGNETOMETER
With the above used as a basis for identifying those magnetic anomalies and acoustic sidescan
targets with the greatest potential for representing submerged cultural resources, the data was
reviewed following completion of the remote sensing survey. Listed in Table 2, a total of
thirteen (n=13) magnetic anomalies and twenty sidescan sonar targets including cables, and a
partially exposed pipeline running the length of the project area were recorded in the survey
corridor. The table includes target description, location, and significance within the survey area.
Relative to management considerations, all magnetic anomalies were analyzed for potential
significance. The largest anomaly in the project area was not given a number. Covering the
eastern end of the survey area, the overhead electric transmission lines, and the sheet piling along
the shore produced this huge anomaly clearly seen in Figure 17, the magnetic contour map for
the project area. The source for this anomaly, the sheet piling and transmission tower, are
presented in Figure 18.
The sources for all but two anomalies were visible on the surface (i.e., sheet pile, mooring buoys,
etc.) and/or were readily visible on the sidescan record (i.e., pipelines, cables, etc.). The sidescan
record is presented in Figure C and reveals that the bay bottom is somewhat featureless with a
scattering of debris, likely left over from Hurricane Ike. A partially exposed pipeline runs the
length of the survey area along with what appears to be a set of smaller lines or cables on the
southwest end of the survey area. Magnetic signatures of Anomalies 1 through 9 are clearly
visible in the sidescan record and are associated with the partially exposed pipeline running SW
to NE along the centerline of the project area. Two others, 10 and 11, form a linear anomaly
inshore and near the southern end of the long pipeline represented by Anomaly 1 through 9.
Though to be a cable or a pipeline, the source for these two is visible as well in the sidescan
record. Anomalies 12 and 13 also appear to form a linear feature running perpendicular to the
southern end of the large central pipeline. While the source for these two are not visible in the
sidescan record, they are thought to most likely be generated by a pipeline.

5. CONCLUSIONS
In September 2009, Panamerican Consultants, Inc. of Memphis, Tennessee, conducted an
intensive remote sensing survey of the proposed Ship Dock #4, located in the Houston Ship
Channel at the confluence of Buffalo and Carpenter Bayous in Harris County, Texas. Performed
for the Houston Fuel Oil Terminal Company, the purpose of the survey was to determine the
absence/presence of magnetic and sidescan sonar targets that may represent potentially
significant submerged cultural resources eligible for listing on the NRHP, which might be
impacted by the proposed undertaking.
Results of the current remote sensing survey identified a total of thirteen (n=13) magnetic
anomalies and twenty (n=20) sidescan sonar targets were recorded in the survey corridor,
including cables and a partially exposed pipeline, which runs the length of the project area. The
sources for all but two anomalies were visible on the surface (i.e., sheet pile, mooring buoys,
etc.) and/or were readily visible on the sidescan record (i.e., pipelines, cables, etc.). Of the 13
anomalies, 11 represent visible pipelines and/or cables, and it is thought that the source for the
other two is also a pipeline. All anomalies are considered to represent non-historic manmade
structures, and no further work is warranted. However, undetected submerged cultural resources
may exist in the survey area, particularly small yet potentially significant watercraft. If such
resources are discovered during the project, work must stop at the location until the THC has
been notified and a plan of investigation is undertaken.
