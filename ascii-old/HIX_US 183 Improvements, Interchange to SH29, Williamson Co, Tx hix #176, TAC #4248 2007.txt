Abstract

ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a 100% pedestrian survey with
supplemental shovel testing along the proposed route of US 183 between the
South Fork of the San Gabriel River and County Road 258, in Williamson
County, Texas. Work was conducted under Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act and the Texas Antiquities Code, in accordance with 36 CFR 800
and 13 TAC 26, which outline the rules and regulations for compliance. Project
archeologists conducted a pedestrian survey within four alternatives of the
proposed US 183 right-of-way (ROW), where right-of-entry was granted. A total
of 283.12 acres of proposed right-of-way were surveyed including the existing
US 183 ROW and the proposed additional ROW. No shovel tests were excavated
within the existing ROW due to extensive disturbance. An additional 20.65
acres of the proposed ROW were not surveyed due to a lack of right-of-entry.
Based on reconnaissance conducted from the edge of the existing ROW, it is the
opinion of investigators that no additional survey is necessary for these
properties.
Only one previously recorded archeological site is located within ¼ mile of the
proposed ROW, Site 41WM688. This site is poorly documented and was
recorded by volunteers in 1979 as being looted. Archeologists were unable to
locate the site based on the reported UTM location, and found no traces of it
within the proposed US 183 alignment. The currently proposed construction
will not impact Site 41WM688 and no further investigation is recommended
within the US 183 right-of-way. One historic-age bridge, which crosses the San
Gabriel River, was evaluated in the 1999 statewide survey of non-truss bridges
conducted by TxDOT. In that survey, the bridge was determined not eligible for
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under Criterion C (Engineering)
at the state level of significance.
Investigators excavated 150 shovel tests in support of the survey and
documented two new historic-age sites—Sites 41WM1154 and 41WM1155. Site
41WM1154 is a diffuse surface scatter of historic debris that extends outside the
APE of the undertaking. The archeological deposits at Site 41WM1154 within
the APE do not contribute to the site’s NRHP or State Archeological Landmark
(SAL)-eligibility.
Site 41WM1155 is an historic farmstead with standing
structures and a dense scatter of historic artifacts dating as early as the 1880s.
Subsurface testing indicates archeological material to a depth of approximately
20 centimeters below ground surface at Site 41WM1155. All four proposed
alternatives will directly impact the site. A Project Historian evaluated the
standing structures on site 41WM1155 and determined that these elements of
the site were ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. The Texas Department of
Transportation will determine the SAL or NRHP-eligibility status of Site
41WM1155, as well as any need for further archeological investigation, in
consultation with the THC.
In addition to these archeological resources, two dinosaur footprints were found,
impressed in the limestone near the southern edge of the San Gabriel riverbed.
While not protected under Section 106 avoidance of these features is
recommended. No artifacts were collected during the survey; all project related
documents and records will be permanently curated at TARL.

Management Summary and Introduction

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION
In September and October 2006, Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a
pedestrian survey of four proposed alignments for US 183 between the South
Fork of the San Gabriel River and County Road 258, in Williamson County,
Texas (Figure 1). The proposed project area is approximately 3.76 miles long
with a width of 500 to 750 feet (152 to 229 meters), comprising a total of 303.77
acres (Plates 1-4, Appendix A).
The investigation included an archival search to identify all previously recorded
surveys, archeological sites, and historic structures. Background research for
this project was conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) and the Texas Historical Commission (THC). According to available data,
there are no Official State Historical Markers (OSHMs) located within the project
area, nor are there any State Archeological Landmarks (SALs), cemeteries, or
sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). A review of the
records on file at TARL and the THC has determined that three previous cultural
resource surveys intersect with the current project area. Only one archeological
site is located within ¼ mile of the proposed right-of-way, 41WM688. Site
41WM688 is described as a scattered prehistoric campsite containing projectile
points, tools, bones, and teeth to a depth of five to six feet below ground surface.
This site is poorly documented and was recorded by volunteers in 1979 as being
looted. Archeologists were unable to locate the site based on the reported UTM
location, and found no traces of it within the proposed US 183 alignment. There
are no additional, previously recorded sites located within ¼ mile of the
proposed project area.
The survey involved intensive pedestrian inspection of the entire project area for
which right-of-entry was obtained. Parcels for which investigators were denied
access were evaluated from the edge of the existing ROW. To comply with the
THC’s minimum survey standard for linear surveys requiring 16 shovel tests per
mile, per 100 feet of width, shovel tests were excavated in all areas with less
than 30% surface visibility at 100-meter intervals, with additional tests
excavated on archeological sites to determine artifact density and to assist in
site boundary delineation. Shovel tests were excavated in ten centimeter levels
to a depth of one meter below the surface, ancient soils, or until otherwise
obstructed, and all sediment was screened through ¼” wire mesh. A total of
150 shovel tests were excavated in support of the project (Plates 1-4). Thirtyfour of these were positive for cultural material, resulting in the identification of
two new historic-age sites, 41WM1154 and 41WM1155.
Site 41WM1154
appears to extend beyond the APE of the undertaking. It consists of barbed wire
coils, purple, clear, and pink glass fragments, whiteware, a ceramic figurine
base, a metal pail, a hinge, unidentified iron scrap, and a large stoneware pot
fragment. No extant features were identified. The portion of the site within the
APE of the undertaking is not recommended as eligible for listing on the NRHP
or as an SAL. Site 41WM1155 is an historic farmstead whose main features
include a house, a barn, a well pump house, an intact privy, possibly another
collapsed barn, and a rectangular concrete plot that could be a flower bed or
some other feature. The remains of a rock wall skirt the back side (west edge) of
the complex and a low, wide earthen berm runs in an arc from the road along
the south and west edge of the property. It is entirely within the APE of the
undertaking.

Management Summary and Introduction

Two of the 34 positive shovel tests were located on the south side of the San
Gabriel River. A single piece of prehistoric lithic debitage was recovered from
each, amounting to an isolated, low-density locale with too little cultural
material to be considered an archeological site.
The survey was conducted between September 13 and October 18, 2006. James
Karbula functioned as the Principal Investigator. Archeologists John Campbell,
Rachel Feit, Matt Stotts, Robert Lassen, Nicole Fournier, David Peyton and Katie
Canavan performed the survey. Artifacts were analyzed in the field and report
writing and took place in November of 2006, following the conclusion of
fieldwork. Succeeding sections of the report include sections on Environmental
and Geomorphic Setting, Cultural Background and Previous Investigations,
Results of Field Investigations, and Conclusions and Recommendations.

Environmental and Geomorphic Setting

ENVIRONMENTAL AND GEOMORPHIC SETTING
The US 183 San Gabriel project area lies on the western edge of Williamson
County. It is part of the Edwards Plateau physiographic province in central
Texas. According to Wermund (2006), the Edwards Plateau is composed of hard
Cretaceous limestones that are trenched by local streams. The upper drainages
typically consist of dry draws that lead into canyons where springs supply the
streams with a constant water source.
Odintz (1996) states that the modern temperatures in Williamson County have
an average high from 96° F (36° C) in July to an average low of 36° F (2° C) in
January. The county receives an average rainfall of 86 centimeters per year.
The vegetation in western Williamson County is made up of tall and mid grasses,
post and live oak, juniper, and mesquite. Historically, a wide range of wildlife
has lived in the county, including bison, deer, bears, mountain lions, alligators,
and small wild game such as wild turkeys.
The project area itself consists of three divisions within the Edwards Plateau
geology, based on Barnes et al. (1974). Alluvium and fluviatile terrace deposits
are located along the South Fork of the San Gabriel River. The alluvium
includes low terrace deposits made up of clay, silt, sand, and gravel and is the
most recent (Holocene) geology in the area. The terrace deposits are Pleistoceneage alluvium deposits of similar composition. In between the South Fork of the
San Gabriel and Seward Junction is the second geological division, the Glen
Rose Formation. This formation was developed during the Lower Cretaceous
period and contains limestone, dolomite, and marl. The project area contains
the upper bed of the Glen Rose Formation, which is about 220 feet (67 m) thick.
The third geological division, the Fredericksburg Group, occurs at Seward
Junction. In the project area, the Fredericksburg Group is made up of Cedar
Park Limestone and Bee Cave Marl. Cedar Park Limestone is a fine grained,
hard, nodular, and burrowed limestone that is 40 feet (12 m) thick. The Bee
Cave Marl soft and white with marine megafossils and has a depth of 24.6 to
39.4 feet (7.5 to 12 m). The Fredericksburg Group was also formed during the
Lower Cretaceous period.
The topography of the project area is relatively flat except for areas along stream
channels. The south bank of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River has the
steepest slope in the project area. Also, an unnamed tributary of the river runs
roughly parallel to the project area and crosses US 183 in two places. A slight
slope in the topography accompanies the tributary, but the drainage is poorly
defined with no cut banks or alluvial deposition.
The Soil Conservation Service Survey Map of Williamson County (Werchan and
Coker 1983) shows that the project area runs through several soil series, with
the most prominent being the Doss and Eckrant series. These series provide a
general description of the geomorphology of the area and give an overview of the
depth and degree of disturbance of any archeological sites. The Doss series
within the project area consists of Doss silty clay on 1 to 5% slopes (DoC). It
occurs in uplands and has a depth of about 1.6 feet (48 cm), with the underlying
material made up of weakly cemented limy earth and limestone fragments. The
soil is typically dark grayish brown in the upper 0.75 feet (23 cm), and brown in
the lower 0.82 feet (25 cm). The Eckrant series is represented primarily by
Eckrant cobbly clay on 1 to 8% slopes (EaD). This soil also occurs in upland
environments, with an average slope of approximately 4% and depth of 1.1 feet

Environmental and Geomorphic Setting

(33 cm). The upper sediment is typically dark grayish brown cobbly clay with a
surface that has a 50% cover of limestone cobbles, ranging in size from 4 to 8
inches (10 to 20 cm) diameter. The underlying material consists of fractured
limestone.
Other soil series are present but occupy only small portions of the project area.
Immediately south of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River are the EckrantRock outcrop complex (ErG) and Brackett-Rock outcrop complex (BkG),
representing rocky outcrops on the terrace south bank of the river. On the point
bars and low terraces along the river are the Sunev silty clay loam series (SuA
on 0-1% slopes on the south bank and SuB on 1-3% slopes on the north bank).
These are well-drained soils with an upper layer of grayish brown silty clay that
extends to 1.5 feet (45 cm) below the surface, and a lower layer of calcium
carbonate-rich, yellowish brown to reddish yellow silty clay loam that can
continue to more than five feet (150 cm) below the surface. In and near the
channel itself is Oakalla soil (Oc), with an upper seven inches (17.5 cm) of dark
brown loam, followed by 16 inches (40 cm) of dark brown clay loam, and a lower
5.5 feet (1.7 m) of dark brown sandy clay loam. Elsewhere in the project area
are the Denton silty clay (DnB), located in a drainage valley north of the river,
Georgetown clay loam (GeB) in an upland area north of the river, and Crawford
(CfB) and Fairlie clays (FaA), which occur in small upland patches near Seward
Junction.
Based on the existing environmental and geological data on the project area,
discrete buried archeological occupations are not likely to be present within the
project area, except on low terraces near the South Fork of the San Gabriel
River. Additional buried sites may be found along the unnamed tributary, but
the drainage does not appear to carry much sediment, making it a less likely to
contain Holocene deposits. The upland areas could potentially contain surficial
or shallowly buried sites, but they are likely to be disturbed by erosion and
agricultural activity.

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS
INVESTIGATIONS
Archeologists generally divide the chronology of central Texas into four periods
that span 12,000 years of human habitation in the area. Based on the
assessment by Ricklis and Collins (1994), the Paleoindian period lasts from
9200 to 6000 B.C. and is characterized by a subsistence pattern that relied
primarily on hunting. Paleoindian sites are the least common, but isolated
Paleoindian artifacts are found throughout central Texas. Early Paleoindian
technologies include Clovis, Folsom, and the controversial Plainview projectile
point types. Later Paleoindian technologies include the Wilson, GolodrinaBarber, and St. Mary’s Hall projectile point intervals. These point types are
sometimes associated with small burned rock features, which appear to be
precursors to the larger rock features of the Archaic period (Collins 2004).
The Archaic period spans 6000 B.C. to A.D. 600 and is noted from an increased
diversity in both tools and subsistence (Ricklis and Collins 1994). The Archaic
period in central Texas is most generally known for the use of heated rocks in
processing food. Archeologists typically divide the Archaic into Early, Middle,
and Late periods. The Early Archaic is represented by Angostura, Early SplitStem, and Marindale-Uvalde point intervals.
Additional tools such as
groundstone, hammerstones, grooved stones, and Guadalupe and Clear Fork
bifaces (probable woodworking tools) indicate increasing complexity during this
period. Large burned rock features and earth ovens for cooking bulbs are also
present in the Early Archaic. The Middle Archaic is represented by the Bell­
Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan-Travis projectile point intervals. The Bell­
Andice-Calf Creek interval most likely coincides with a migration of bison into
the region, and the sites from this period tend to be more ephemeral due to the
necessity of mobility for bison hunting. The Taylor and Nolan-Travis intervals
mark a return to the more sedentary, hot rock cooking lifestyle. Burned rock
middens (large accumulations of broken and discarded heated rocks) make their
first appearances during this interval. The Late Archaic represents the height of
popularity for burned rock middens, particularly near the beginning of the
period, when moisture is lowest and other subsistence options are less viable.
Numerous projectile point types emerge during the Late Archaic, along with
additional artifacts such as corner tang knives, stone pipes, and marine shell
ornamentation (Collins 2004). Some archeologists further subdivide this period
into Late Archaic I and II (Johnson 1995). The first interval represents dry
conditions with increased midden accumulation, and the second interval follows
increased moisture with cultural changes such as smaller projectile points and
possible religious influences from Eastern Woodland cultures.
The Late Prehistoric period, extending from A.D. 600 to A.D. 1600, is marked by
the appearance of the bow and arrow in central Texas, along with the later
appearance of pottery. The Late Prehistoric period in central Texas is generally
divided into two intervals that follow the distinction between the Austin and
Toyah cultural intervals. The Austin interval is marked by the appearance of
small, thin (Scallorn) projectile points that probably indicate a switch from atlatl
to bow and arrow technology. Warlike violence increases, but subsistence
technology remains essentially the same as that of the Late Archaic. The Toyah
interval represents a more drastic change, in which pottery, Perdiz points, large
thin bifaces, prismatic blades, and scrapers become prominent. Much of this

Cultural Background and Previous Investigations

technological shift indicates a greater reliance on hunting, particularly bison
(Collins 2004).
Finally, the Historic period lasts from A.D. 1600 though A.D. 1950 and follows
the arrival and spread of European-based cultures into the region. Collins
(2004) divides the Historic period into three parts. The earliest part begins with
the arrival of the first Europeans in the late seventeenth century. Indigenous
populations at this point have already been heavily displaced by disease as well
as Spanish oppression in the south and mounted Apaches in the northwest.
Spanish missions characterize the next part of the Historic period. Missions
were not common in central Texas, except for the ones established in Bexar
County. By the end of the middle Historic, Comanches had migrated into the
central Texas region. During final part of the Historic period, European-derived
settlement gradually replaced all the indigenous habitation of the region.
In Williamson County, archeological sites from all time periods are present. The
most representative example is the Wilson-Leonard Site, which is located near
the project area (along Brushy Creek) and spans the Paleoindian through Late
Prehistoric periods. According to Collins (1998), archeologists recorded the site
in 1973, and the first test excavations took place in July 1981. Large-scale
excavation lasted over two years, from January 1981 through April 1984.
However, the site report remained unpublished for nearly 10 years.
Archeologists re-visited the site in 1992 and 1993 to apply more modern
archeological techniques for a more complete analysis. The excavations revealed
Paleoindian features such as an 11,000-year old bison bone bed and a 10,000­
year old human burial. Archaic features included rock-lined ovens from Early
Archaic contexts and burned rock middens from the Middle and Late Archaic.
The Late Prehistoric period is represented mostly by Scallorn arrow points and
may have contributed to the accumulation of one of the burned rock middens.
The extensive archeological remains at the Wilson-Leonard Site enable
archeologists to examine changes in subsistence strategies and technology over
a long period of time in a single area.
According to Odintz (1996), Spanish explorers likely passed through the county
as early as the late seventeenth century, and some missions were established
along the San Gabriel River in the following century. Anglo settlement of the
county began in earnest when Dr. Thomas Kenney established Kenney’s Fort on
Brushy Creek in 1838. The Texas Legislature organized Williamson County in
1848, naming Georgetown as the county seat. The new county’s population and
level of intensive cultivation (primarily subsistence crops) increased up to the
Civil War, after which much of the vigorous agricultural activity dropped
significantly. Although the war inflicted little damage on the county, the total
value of farms and livestock dropped dramatically.
The development of railroads in Williamson County greatly influenced
settlement. The first railroad to cross through Williamson County was the
International & Great Northern Railroad which came through in 1875. The later
Missouri Pacific Railroad, now Union Pacific, is paralleled by US 79. The arrival
of railroads and the development of the breaking plow enabled cattle and cotton
to become boom industries in the 1870s.

Previous Archeological Investigations

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
A review of the records on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) has determined that three
previous cultural resource surveys intersect with the current project area, and
two more have been conducted within a one kilometer radius of the project
corridor. Although most of the project area has not been previously surveyed,
these earlier projects have uncovered archeological sites in and near the project
area. The closest site is 41WM688 (also known as the High Gabriel or Lotis Site)
and is recorded at TARL as having been investigated by Lotis volunteer
archeologists in November 1979 and revisited in March 1985 by an unnamed
group. The methods of the 1979 investigation are unknown, and the 1985
revisit consisted of a surface inspection. No other archeological sites are located
within ¼ mile of the current project area.
In May 1981, the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation
conducted an identification/survey of a proposed bridge replacement on CR 369,
a little over a ½ mile (1 km) south of SH 29. The project recorded Sites
41WM458, 41WM459, and 41WM460, the closest of which is over a mile (2 km)
east of the US 183 San Gabriel River Project area. All three of these sites were
found to be disturbed prehistoric lithic quarries. Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
conducted a linear survey and impact evaluation for 2.8 kilometers of the east
side of US 183 from the South Fork of the San Gabriel River, and TxDOT
conducted a survey of approximately six acres south of the South Fork of the
San Gabriel River along the east side of US 183 in 2004. These two projects
recorded no new archeological sites.
Two more projects have been conducted within one kilometer of the current
project area. In May 2003, the LCRA surface inspected and shovel tested the
Liberty Hill Wastewater Treatment Plant and recorded Site 41WM1074. In
October 2004, TRC surface inspected and shovel tested a proposed pipeline
installation for the Liberty Hill Regional Wastewater System and recorded four
additional sites: 41WM1107, 41WM1108, 41WM1109, and 41WM1110.
Finally, TARL records indicate that there are five additional sites within one
kilometer of the project area that are not well recorded and are not affiliated with
any known CRM projects. Site 41WM244 was excavated by J. E. Pearce
sometime between 1928 and 1938 as part of the San Gabriel Mounds project.
Site 41WM111 was recorded as the result of a 1963 salvage project, while Sites
41WM473, 41WM474, and 41WM475 were recorded on University of Texas Site
Forms in 1980. The salvage form and the UT Site Forms are outdated and
contain very little information on the sites and no information on the projects
under which they were recorded.
Table 1 summarizes the archeological sites located within one kilometer of the
US 183 San Gabriel project area. A summary of these previously recorded sites
follows.

Site 41WM111 was excavated as part of a salvage project in 1963. The site is
made up of at least two burned rock middens located on a high southern terrace
of the South San Gabriel River, slightly less than one kilometer east of the
project area. The site form at TARL states that the site contains flint and
burned rock and has undergone test excavations. Very little information is
readily available on this site, but it will not be impacted by the current project.
Site 41WM244 is located one kilometer west of the project area, just north of a
northward bend in the South San Gabriel River. The site was excavated as part
of the San Gabriel Mounds project between 1928 and 1938. The site is noted as
containing a midden, human bones, and mussel shells. Very little information
on this site is on record, but the site will not be impacted by the current project.
Site 41WM473 is located on a high terrace about 200 meters south of the South
San Gabriel River about half a kilometer east of the project area. It has been
poorly recorded in the records at TARL. The site is known to be a burned rock
midden containing dart points of unknown types, bone, and snail shells. The
site is also reported to have contained corner-tang knives. The site has been
excavated and was reported as destroyed.
Site 41WM474 is located near the north bank of the South San Gabriel River,
about one kilometer west of the project area and across the river from Site
41WM475. The site is made up of projectile points (Perdiz) and debitage on the
surface. No subsurface tests have been conducted. Due to the lack of
information available on this site, it is unknown whether the site has been
recommended for further testing. However, the current project will not impact
the site.
Site 41WM475 is located along the south bank of the South San Gabriel River,
on the east and west sides of a small unnamed tributary, about one kilometer
west of the project area and across the river from Site 41WM474. The site is
made up of two large burned rock middens with conch shell beads, dart points
(Ellis), preforms, and a scraper. The site is also reported to have contained a
burial. The west end of the site was destroyed by construction or earth-moving
activity. It is unknown whether the site has been recommended for further
testing, but it will not be impacted by the current project.
Site 41WM688 is a large prehistoric habitation site, possibly containing multiple
occupations located on the south bank of the South Fork of the San Gabriel
River near the US 183 intersection. Its exact size is unknown. Cultural

materials are reported to extend to 5 to 6.5 feet (1.5 to 2 m) below the ground
surface. Because site is located near the South San Gabriel River it could be
well stratified. Artifacts observed include untyped projectile points (arrow, dart,
and spear points), knives, and scrapers made from dark gray to black chert.
Bones and teeth were also observed in the property owner’s back yard. The site
was reported to have been heavily looted, but to still contain potentially useful
cultural information. At the time the site was recorded, it was to be destroyed
by residential development and further investigation was recommended.
Site 41WM1074 is a prehistoric lithic scatter in a formerly cultivated field that is
now used as pasture, located over 1.5 miles (2.64 km) south-southeast of
Seward Junction on an upland terrace, north of the South Fork of the San
Gabriel River. The site contained three dart point fragments of indeterminate
types, as well as secondary and tertiary debitage. Recorded site dimensions
were approximately 492 by 246 feet (150 by 75 m) and it was presumed that the
area was utilized for tool making and possibly for hunting and gathering food.
Most of the site contained 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) of topsoil that had been
mixed by plowing and erosion. No further investigation was recommended.
Site 41WM1107 is a 100-meter long scatter of lithic artifacts and burned rock on
a high northern terrace of the South San Gabriel River about one kilometer east
of the project area. The site is made up of low to moderate density lithic
debitage and burned rock that is buried up to 30 centimeters below the surface.
The sediment within the site boundaries is markedly darker and loamier than
the matrix surrounding the site, indicated anthropogenic activities. Not enough
burned rock is present to define the site as a burned rock midden, but the site
does appear to be an intact habitation area. The investigators recommend
avoidance or testing if avoidance is impossible.
Site 41WM1108 is a multiple component historic and prehistoric site located
about ¼ mile (½ km) east-northeast of the US 183 bridge over the South Fork of
the San Gabriel River. The site lies on the northeastern terrace of a deeply
incised unnamed tributary of the river. Two historic features are present on the
surface. The first is made up of shaped limestone slabs, possibly representing a
structure. The second is a cluster of three sotol plants that appear to have been
planted for decoration about one meter away from the limestone slabs.
Approximately 30 feet (10 m) west of the features are three depressions in the
ground surface that appear to be cultural and could be looter pits. Historic and
prehistoric artifact concentrations are highest in this area. Historic artifacts
from the upper 12 to 20 inches (30 to 40 cm) include metal fragments,
whiteware fragments, and aquamarine glass bottle fragments.
Prehistoric
artifacts also occur in the upper 30 to 40 centimeters and include debitage and
burned rock. Further work or avoidance was recommended.
Site 41WM1109 is a lithic quarry located on an eroded limestone gravel terrace
in an upland area about 0.7 kilometers north of the South Fork of the San
Gabriel River and 0.9 kilometers northeast of the US 183 bridge over the river.
The site is 400 meters by 33 or more meters and contains a low-density
distribution of debitage, cores, and a few tools, including an indeterminate
“Uvalde-like” projectile point. Some scattered burned rocks were observed, but
the site has been eroded and deprived of its original context. No further work
recommended.
Site 41WM1110 is a quarry located about 1.25 kilometers north northeast of the
US 183 bridge over the river and lies within an upland environment that is 1.2

kilometers north of the river. The site is 90 meters by 33 or more meters and
contains a low-density scatter of debitage, cores, and edge-modified flakes on
the surface and in the upper 30 to 40 centimeters of sediment. There were no
discrete components encountered in the buried materials. No further work
recommended.
Previous research indicates that while archaeological sites are present near the
project area, most have been disturbed by erosion or by more recent cultural
activities. The most promising site, 41WM688, was located on a low terrace of
the South Fork of the San Gabriel River. The deep cultural levels of 41WM688
indicate that well stratified sites may exist along the river in this project area.
However, rocky terrain near the banks of the river may limit the potential for
additional deeply buried sites. Another potentially important site, 41WM1108,
is located on the terrace of an unnamed tributary and contains shallowly buried
cultural materials from multiple components. Upland sites near the project
area, on the other hand, tend to be surface exposures without intact contexts.
Due to this fact, existing modern commercial and residential development could
easily impact any existing sites, and therefore, the probability of encountering
significant sites in this environment is low.

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Hicks & Company’s intensive survey of the project area was designed and
performed in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s minimum
survey standards for linear surveys, which requires 16 shovel tests per mile, per
100 feet of ROW. Investigators conducted a 100% pedestrian survey of the areas
for which right-of-entry was permitted, supplemented by 150 shovel tests
(Plates 1-4). Shovel tests were excavated at 100-meter intervals in undisturbed
areas with less than 30% surface visibility. On average, shovel tests were 30
centimeters in diameter, and excavated to a depth of one meter below the
ground surface, to ancient soil, or until otherwise obstructed. Areas for which
right-of-entry was not permitted, totaling 20.65 acres, were evaluated from the
edge of the existing ROW and documented photographically. The majority of
these areas were easily viewed from the roadside, and observably impacted by
construction or agricultural practice (Figures 2 and 3). No cultural materials or
extant historic structures were observed on any of these properties. It is the
opinion of investigators that no additional investigation is necessary for these
20.65 acres. No shovel tests were excavated within the existing US 183 ROW
due to extensive disturbance related to buried utilities, commercial and private
driveways, and drainage features (see Figures 2 and 4). Of the 150 shovel tests
excavated, 34 were positive for cultural material, resulting in the identification of
two new sites, 41WM1154 and 41WM1155. Archeologists also encountered two
dinosaur footprints that were imprinted in the limestone riverbed, near the
southern edge of the San Gabriel River (Figure 5).

One historic-age bridge structure was identified within the project area. The US
183 Bridge over the South San Gabriel River was built in 1964 (Figure 6). This
bridge was included in the 1999 statewide survey of non-truss bridges
conducted by TxDOT in compliance with Section 110 of the National Historic
Preservation Act and the Memorandum of Understanding between TxDOT and
the Texas Historical Commission. In that survey, the bridge was determined not
eligible for the NRHP under Criterion C (Engineering) at the state level of
significance. The bridge was found to exhibit a loss of engineering integrity due
to a widening or a major alteration and it received the lowest Technological
Rating (3) possible. Because the bridge may have local significance, TxDOT is
currently consulting with the Williamson County Historical Commission (CHC)
concerning the potential for local historic significance.

Extensive disturbance was documented throughout the project area. With the
exception of a small parcel to the southeast of the US 183/South Fork San
Gabriel River intersection, nearly the entire project area to the south of the river
is disturbed due to previous and current highway construction as well as
commercial property development (Figures 7 and 8). This area accounts for
approximately 4,500 linear feet (1.37 km) of the project area. In addition to this
large area, an approximately 65-foot (20 m) wide drainage ditch parallels the
south side of US 183 for approximately ¼ mile (400 m), immediately north of the
newly constructed Pulte Homes subdivision, which has caused additional
disturbance within the project area (Figures 9 and 10).
Commercial
development, utilities routing, and intensive land clearing have further
contributed to surface disturbance throughout the project area (Figures 11, 12
and 13), including the entire existing ROW (see Figures 2 and 4).

SHOVEL TESTS
A total of 150 shovel tests were excavated within the project area. Thirty-four of
these shovel tests were positive for cultural material. The US 183 crossing at
the South Fork of the San Gabriel River separates the southern portion of the
project area. Eighteen shovel tests were excavated on the east side of the
highway along this section. Ten of these were located on the relatively flat flood
terrace, immediately south of the river, six of which were excavated in an
attempt to locate Site 41WM688. Although two of these tests were positive, with
one piece of lithic debitage each, four other shovel tests and a careful surface
inspection of the area revealed no additional artifacts. Due to the paucity of
cultural material, coupled with observable surface disturbance, the area was not
recorded as an archeological site. A typical soil profile on this terrace consisted
of approximately 45 centimeters of (10YR 4/3) brown clay loam overlying a
lighter, compact (7.5YR 5/4) brown clay loam containing CaCO3 and limestone.
Four more shovel tests were excavated on the southern edge of the terrace, none
of which uncovered cultural material.
The remaining eight shovel tests
excavated on the south side of the river were done so along the eastern edge of
the current US 183 construction activity. This area was mostly hillslope, and no
cultural materials were encountered. Soils here were very thin to non-existent,
with bedrock exposure at the surface.
Near the base of the hillslopes
investigators recorded between 20 to 35 centimeters of (10YR 3/2) very dark
grayish brown clay loam over limestone bedrock.
No shovel tests were
excavated on the west side of the highway due to disturbance. These areas were
documented photographically (Figures 14 and 15).

The remaining shovel tests were excavated on the north side of the San Gabriel
River, with all artifacts being recovered from the two newly recorded sites,
41WM1154 and 41WM1155. Fifty-nine shovel tests were excavated on the west
side of US 183 between the river and a small residential neighborhood located
nearly 1.5 miles to the north. None of these shovel tests contained cultural
material.
Disturbance was observed throughout this area, attributed to
residential construction and drainage features for the highway and housing

developments. Many push-piles of limestone cobbles were observed within the
proposed alternatives that are a result of machine clearing and surface scraping
(Figures 16, 17, and 18). The soil recorded across this area consisted of (10YR
3/2) very dark grayish brown clay loam, which was typically very shallow (less
than 30 cm). Many shovel tests locations recorded no soil, with limestone
bedrock at the surface. However, the depth of soil recorded in shovel tests did
increase to approximately 60-75 centimeters nearing the north edge of the San
Gabriel River.

The remaining non-site shovel tests (n=17) were excavated on various, small
properties scattered throughout the length of the project corridor, on the north

site 41WM1155 will be discussed in detail along with the following site
descriptions.

SITE 41WM688
Site 41WM688 was reported to be a large prehistoric habitation site, located on
the south bank of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River near its intersection
with US 183. Cultural material was reported to extend to depths of 5 to 6.5 feet
below the ground surface, including untyped projectile points, knives, and
scrapers. The site, however, was poorly documented and investigators were
unable to locate it based on the reported UTM location. The coordinates were
traced with a sub-meter accuracy Trimble GPS unit, which lead investigators
into the San Gabriel riverbed (Figure 19).
Figure 19

Location of Reported Site 41WM688 UTM Coordinates, in Riverbed

As determined by the landform and the topographic plotting on file at TARL, the probable site
area is the current location of a fenced power facility, which has disturbed the sediment along with
any potential cultural material it contained. Within this area on the flood terrace, six shovel tests
were excavated in an attempt to located Site 41WM688, resulting in the recovery of two pieces of
lithic debitage. Soils excavated in this area reached depths of 40 to 60 centimeters below the
surface, terminating at heavy caliche and calcium carbonate. Further disturbance is attributed to a
worn gravel road, which parallels the steep escarpment along the south edge of the river valley.
Immediately north of this road, the landform drops drastically, with exposed limestone bedrock
lining the slope into the riverbed. To the south of the level flood terrace, the landform again
begins a steep incline, which is defined by thin upland soil over shallow limestone bedrock
(Figure 20).

Figure 20

Results of Field Investigations

Southern Edge of Flood Terrace Beginning to Slope to the South, Construction
Activity to the West

From this point, continuing to the south, the area adjacent and to the east of the existing US 183
corridor has been disturbed by construction. With the exception of two pieces of lithic debitage,
no traces of site 41WM688 were found within the proposed US 183 alignment. Due to the paucity
of cultural material and disturbance, investigators feel that the proposed undertaking will have no
impact on Site 41WM688, and no further work is recommended within the APE.

SITE 41WM1154
Site 41WM1154 is located on the west side of US 183, approximately 1,000 feet north of the
intersection with SH 29. The site was originally recorded as two separate historic debris scatters,
but since they are very close and are related to the same property tract, investigators later
collapsed them into a single site. The site occurs in a shallow depositional environment with
exposed bedrock on the surface. The scatter sprawls across a dense cedar and oak thicket and into
a recently cleared swath adjacent to the existing US 183 ROW (Figure 21). The site is essentially
a very sparse historic debris scatter confined entirely to the ground surface. Artifacts observed on
the surface consist of a barbed wire coil, one fragment of clear glass, several plain whiteware
shards, broken brick fragments, a turn-of-the-century medicine bottle, a metal hook, a ceramic
frozen charlotte base, a metal pail, a hinge, several pieces of unidentified scrap, and a large
stoneware pot fragment (see Figures 21 and 22). None of these items were collected during the
survey. The material is non-diagnostic and could represent any time between 1890 and 1940. No
artifacts were found within shovel tests. The site extends outside the limits of the proposed new
ROW for US 183. Investigators observed two piles of uncut limestone at the west edge and
outside the proposed new ROW for the US 183 expansion. An old fence line of barbed wire and
cedar posts runs in a northeasterly direction across the site. The majority of the artifacts are on the
part of the site that is outside the proposed ROW expansion. There are no subsurface or structural
features save for a metal pipe stuck into the ground outside the proposed ROW expansion. The
purpose of this feature is not clear. Seven shovel tests were excavated at the site. None of them
contained buried cultural material and all confirmed that soils are very shallow in this area (Table
2).

Site 41WM1154, like site 41WM1155 is located on land once owned by Lafette G. Ford. Site
41WM1154 is on the original 200 acre tract purchased by Ford in 1871 (WCDR 13/65-66). As
related in the site background for 41WM1155 (see following section), L.G. Ford was one of the
founding members of the Union Hall community, arriving to the area in 1871 with the Matthews,
Seward, Leatherwood, and Faubion families who owned nearby or adjoining tracts of land. Ford
was a Trustee for the local school, and a founding member of the Cumberland Presbyterian
Church (Georgetown Sun 1933, Matthews 1975, Scarborough 1973). Ford sold the property along
with the tract containing Site 41WM1155 to J.D. Womack in 1908 (WCDR 128/96). Womack
lived on this property for several years before moving into Liberty Hill. He sold the property in
1942 to Herman Haedge (WCDR 315/268).

Though the location of the Ford/Womack house is not entirely certain, it was likely located on the
northwest corner of the intersection of US 183 and SH 29, approximately 750 feet southwest of
Site 41WM1154. Though Ford’s house is now gone, and a 1950s vintage house stands in its place
or near it, a cluster of red wooden barns and outbuilding structures are located adjacent to the
existing house (Figures 23 and 24). Some, if not all of these structures almost certainly predate
the existing house and may be related to the Ford farmstead. These structures are surrounded by
large, mature oaks. A house and barn are shown at this location on the 1925 highway plans for the
proposed US 183 (then SH 29) roadway, and these are the only structures (besides those that
represent Site 41WM1155) on the Ford property along US 183 (Figure 25). Standing in front of
the existing barns and looking south, it is clear that this location is the highest point on the Ford
property, with a commanding view to the south, west and east (Figure 26). It stands to reason that
this would have been the spot Ford chose for his homesite.

Site 41WM1154 is a debris scatter likely emanating from the Ford/Womack homesite to the
southwest. The site extends beyond the proposed APE and likely encompasses the area to the
southwest all the way to SH 29. The debris within the APE consists of limited, generally non-

diagnostic domestic material, which without context, and with no specific temporal associations
has no further data potential. Given the lack of features and the sparseness of the debris scatter it
almost certainly does not represent the original Ford homesite itself. The site increases in density
as it moves toward the southwest, which further supports the supposition that the original
Ford/Womack house was located near the existing barns and 1950s vintage house. Site
41WM1154, within the proposed ROW expansion is extremely sparse, lacks integrity, and the
artifacts have no intrinsic or informational value due to the relative lack of diagnostics and broad
temporal span indicated. While the property itself has some local significance in terms of its
association with a community founder, the portion of the site within the APE contains no elements
that could contribute to the site’s eligibility for the NRHP or as an SAL, under Criterion D. No
further work is recommended within the APE for Site 41WM1154.

SITE 41WM1155
Site 41WM1155 is an historic farmstead whose main features include a house, a barn, a well pump
house, an intact privy, possibly another collapsed barn, and a rectangular concrete perimeter that
could be a flower bed or some other feature (Figure 27). There is a remote possibility that the
perimeter could represent a grave location, as it is a size and type often found in cemeteries in this
area. The presence of a thick mottle of young hackberry trees and residential metal debris
prevented subsurface testing of this feature. The remains of a rock wall skirt the back side (west
edge) of the complex and a low, wide earthen berm runs in an arc from the road along the south
and west edge of the property. This berm probably corresponds to the actual residential boundary,
as defined in a 1925 property map created prior to construction of SH 29 (now US 183, Figure
28). The site is entirely contained within the proposed new ROW for US 183.

The standing house itself (Figure 29) was originally built as a wood frame two-room dwelling
with a cedar-shingled gabled roof. The house sits on a limestone block and beam foundation with
a continuous skirting around the outer edges. Porches were present across the front and back of
the house. Portions of these were later enclosed in to form rooms. The house has 1x10 pine
flooring in all rooms except the rear enclosed porch room, in which 1x3 oak tongue and groove
flooring was added. Residents nailed cardboard and tar paper on the wood walls for insulation,
then covered them with wallpaper.

Wood-Frame House on Site 41WM1155

The original construction date for the house is unknown. However, based on cut nails fastening the
roof rafters, original window frames, doorframes, flooring joists, and archival research, the house
was probably built between 1882 and 1895. Modifications to the house probably took place up to
the 1920s or 1930s. Specifically, a chimney was added to the back porch, which was partially
enclosed to become an outdoor kitchen area. The chimney was fed by two stoves—one inside the
house that likely was intended for heat, and another on the back porch that was intended for
cooking, evidenced by the smoke-blackened roof rafters on the back porch. The chimney itself
was made of yellow paste, machine-made brick typical of the early twentieth century, and held
together with Portland cement. Other additions to the house include enclosing part of the front
porch to form a small room, and enclosing part of the rear porch to form a fourth room (Figure
30). Electricity was added to the house at some point, but the outdoor privy and well pump house
attest to the continued absence of indoor plumbing.

Sketch of Site 41WM1155 House and Barn; Plan and Profile Views

The standing barn (see Figure 30) was built in the same manner as the house, with the same
materials, suggesting that it was probably built concurrent to the house. The original enclosed
structure contained just one room and may have been used for habitation at one time, since it
clearly had a door, a window, and pine plank floors raised about a foot above ground surface on a
limestone block foundation supporting beam floor joists. Lean-to pens are partially enclosed on
the east and west sides of the barn. These have no formal flooring. Both the house and the barn
were painted red at one time, though the paint is now very faded. Additionally both are currently
in very poor condition, having most recently served as livestock shelters (Figure 31).

Barn Used as Livestock Shelter on Site 41SM1155

A wood-frame privy is located behind the house, as is a cement low perimeter wall measuring
approximately 4x6 feet and is currently filled with barbed wire, bed springs, and other metal trash
set together by brushy vegetation and hackberry saplings. The purpose of this cement perimeter is
not clear. Investigators suspect most likely it was a garden bed of some sort, though the size, shape
and construction of the feature is not unlike those observed at nearby cemeteries.

In addition to the existing potentially artifact-bearing features consisting of an in situ privy, pump
house, and cement perimeter, there is an extensive artifact scatter behind the house to the south
and west. The scatter consists of bottle glass, whiteware, salt-glazed stoneware, can scrap, snuff
bottle fragments, machine parts, ceramic doll fragments, personal items, architectural hardware,
cut bone, etc. (Figure 32). In short, the type of material that characterizes a domestic trash
assemblage (Table 3).

Results of Field Investigations

Clay pigeon fragments found on the surface around two shovel tests attest to the site’s use for
target practice at some point. Investigators dug 49 shovel tests at Site 41WM1155. The shovel
tests were spaced every 10 meters, in a grid pattern within the site. Shovel tests typically revealed
20-35 centimeters of sandy clay loam over limestone bedrock. Cultural material was densest in
and around shovel tests located between the main house, the privy and small berm forming the
southern boundary of the site. Shovel tests in this area typically contained cultural material on the
surface to a depth of 20 centimeters, with occasional artifacts found 20-30 centimeters below
surface. Artifact density was noticeably lower to the north of the house, around the barn and the
corral.

In terms of the date range, only a few of the artifacts exhibited temporally diagnostic attributes.
Square nails found in the house and in shovel tests represent the earliest dateable material,
suggesting the house was built before the turn of the century. Diagnostic bottle fragments
exhibiting crown cap and threaded lips and decal-decorated porcelain date other material in shovel
tests to after 1905 and into the 1930s. The majority of the artifacts observed during the survey,
such as plain whiteware and stoneware, however, were temporally non-diagnostic and could
represent any time from 1880-1930. Most of the material on the surface and all of the material in
shovel tests is very fragmentary. However, investigators retrieved some complete bottles from the
surface that are more recent. These include condiment bottles, medicine bottles and soda bottles
that date to between 1920 and 1960, and were found near the northern edge of the site. These may
not be associated with the residential occupation of the site, but with later dumping from the
roadway. The artifacts observed in shovel tests were unexceptional, but the completeness of the
domestic assemblage, it’s patterning, and the possibility for intact assemblages near the house,
around the privy, and in other features give the site some analytical potential.

SITE HISTORY AND BACKGROUND
Site 41WM1155 is located approximately 1,200 feet south of the junction of SH 29 and US 183,
known as Sewards Junction. Site 41WM1155 is on a tract of land whose original land patent was
given to John B. Robinson, who probably never occupied the land (Figure 33). The patent was
recorded in 1849. However, an agreement recorded in the Travis County deed records (WCDR
1/49) indicates that Robinson actually purchased the land through a land agent, E.D. Harmon, as
early as 1835. According to a survey abstract in the Williamson County records (Williamson
County Book of Surveys, p. 10), Harmon had been a land agent working for the State of Coahuila
y Mexico to facilitate sales in the Nashville Colony, more commonly known as Robertson’s
Colony. Due to the fact that colonial offices for land titles closed on the eve of the Texas
Revolution in November of 1835, and due to some complicated legal issues associated with many
of the titles assigned in the Nashville (Robertson) Colony, Robinson’s actual title was apparently
not filed or issued until 1849. As part of the agreement between Harmon and Robinson, Harmon
was tasked with subdividing and selling off smaller tracts within the Robinson League (Figure
34). For unknown reasons, he never completed this task. However, his son Isaac, a resident of
Chicago, began it in 1871 (Williamson County Deed Index 1844-1876).

Plat Map from WCDR 13/3, showing Robinson League partially subdivided. The
Matthews and Ford tracts are south of the subdivided 200 acre tract shown here.

Site 41WM1155 pertains to the community that evolved as a result of that subdivision. The
community has been known as Matthews, Union Hall, and Seward’s Junction. The area’s first
settler was Greenleaf Fisk, who fought in the Battle of San Jacinto, was elected to the Republic of
Texas House of Representatives and who served as Williamson County’s first chief justice
(Laughlin 1996). Fisk built a house on a nearby league (east of US 183) in 1846. Other families
who made their homes on tracts adjoining Fisk’s included the Johnson, Schooly and Walker
families (Scarborough 1973). These families continued to occupy the area through the turn of the
century. Additional settlers came in the early 1870s when the John B. Robinson league was
subdivided by E.D. Harmon and sold as smaller tracts. Among the families who purchased land
from Harmon beginning in 1871 were the Matthews, the Fords, the Sewards, the Leatherwoods,
and the Faubions (WCDR, Direct index 1844-1876). According to census records, many of Union
Hall’s early residents came from Tennessee, so it is possible that these families were recruited
based on ties that the original Nashville colony’s members (who named the colony after the capital
city in their home state) had with families back in their home state.

Site 41WM1155 is located on a parcel of the Robinson League originally purchased from Isaac
Harmon by John G. Matthews. Matthews and his family built their house near a spring on the San
Gabriel River. The family settled in a one-room log cabin that was already at that location when
they arrived. There was no record of who could have built the cabin, but it is possible that it could
have been built by Rangers patrolling the area or even by an unknown Nashville Colony settler.
Subsequently, John Matthews built a more permanent stone house for the family to occupy, and
the log cabin served as the area’s first school in 1872 (Scarborough 1973, Matthews 1975). The
house still is standing today; the log cabin is in ruins. Both are well outside the current project

APE. A permanent school was later built on the other side of what is now US 183 and called
Union Hall. John Matthews served as a school trustee along with L.G. Ford, Ben Johnson and
C.C. Leatherwood (Scarborough 1973, Williamson County School District Applications 1883).
The Matthews family consisted of John G., his wife Leonora and seven children, the youngest of
which was born a year after the family moved into the rock house. The Matthews’ initially farmed
cotton, wheat, oats, cane and hay. They later farmed corn as well (Matthews 1975).
In 1882 Abner (A.B.) Matthews, the 23 year old son of John and Leonora Matthews, married
Sallie Ford (21), the daughter of Lafette Ford, who owned the neighboring farmstead to the north
(Williamson County Geneological Society 1983, Matthews 1975). The couple was married in the
Matthews’ rock house on the San Gabriel and treated to a large neighborhood feast (Matthews
1975). Lafette Ford himself had come to the area at the same time as Matthews (Georgetown Sun
1933). Ford initially purchased 200 acres of land from Isaac Harmon (WCDR 13/65-66), then
later (in 1883) purchased the adjacent 200 acres on the north of his property when his neighbor,
A.H. Parrish died (WCDR 33/377). Ford, who like Matthews was born in Tennessee, engaged in
general farming and agriculture, and like Matthews he was instrumental in establishing the local
school and the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (Georgetown Sun 1933, Matthews 1975,
Scarborough 1973). In 1890, A.B. Matthews sold his father-in-law, L.G. Ford, a 35-acre tract of
land abutting the south line of Ford’s original 200-acre tract (WCDR 68/232-33). Site
41WM1155 was built on this 35-acre tract (Figure 35).

Figure 35
Plat Map of Matthews tract from 1931, showing Ford (Womack) tracts to the north.
Also note Faubion and Leatherwood Tracts,

The house and barn at the site were probably built around the time of the sale. The earliest known
map to depict the house is the 1925 Plan and Profile Schematic for State Highway 29 (now US
183, see Figure 28). Neither J.G. Matthews nor L.G. Ford lived there; Ford’s home was on the
adjoining 200-acre tract—probably located at what is now the northwestern corner of Seward
Junction, as depicted on the 1925 plan and profile schematic. The Matthews home, as already

discussed was located a half-mile to the southwest on the San Gabriel. However, it is possible that
the house was initially built for Ford’s daughter, Sallie, and son-in-law A.B. Matthews to live in.
The census records for 1890 have been lost, so no written records have been identified that would
substantiate that idea.
It is likely that by 1900 the house was occupied by renters. The 1900 US Census lists a few nonlandowning residents near the Fords. Wilson Bell and his family occupied a home somewhere
south of the Ford house, as did the Butler family. All community members were white at that
time, save for the African American McLane family who rented the Matthews stone house and
farmed the land through the 1920s (US Census Records 1900-1930, Matthews 1975). J.G.
Matthews and had moved his family to nearby Liberty Hill in 1886 to educate his younger
children (Matthews 1975).

In 1908 L.G. Ford sold all of his land in Union Hall to J.D. Womack (WCDR 128/96). Ford and
his wife Mary then moved into Liberty Hill to be closer to two of their grown daughters and son,
Pleasant (Georgetown Sun 1933). Their neighbors in Liberty Hill included the members of the
Matthews family, the Faubions and the Leatherwoods; in short, many of the same individuals and
families that formed the Union Hall community of the 1870s (US Census Records 1910-1930).
L.G. Ford died in 1919 and Mary died in 1933. Both are buried in the Liberty Hill cemetery
(Liberty Hill Cemetery Association 1983).

Meanwhile, Womack continued to farm the Ford place. He is listed as residing on that property in
the 1910 and 1920 censuses. Among the nearby tenants who could have occupied the house at
Site 41WM1155, J.W. and Willie Reed are listed in the 1920 census in the house just south of
Womack’s. J.W. was black, his wife was white, according to the 1920 census. By 1930 most of
the original Union Hall settlers had moved to Liberty Hill or to other places. The newcomers to
the Seward Junction area were primarily Black (US Census Records 1920-1930).

Womack eventually moved to Liberty Hill and in 1942 sold the property to Herman Haedge
(WCDR 315/268) who held on the to land through the 1960s. By that time, however, the house at
Site 41WM1155 had been abandoned, in all likelihood due to road construction and expansion of
US 183.

SITE SUMMARY AND ASSESSMENT
Site 41WM1155 is a largely intact tenant or sharecropper’s farmstead located on a larger tract of
land associated with two founding families of a dispersed rural community known variously as
Matthews, Union Hall and Sewards Junction. Though the farmstead may have been originally
built for the married son (A.B. Matthews) and daughter (Sallie Ford Matthews) of these families,
they did not occupy the house for long before they moved onto their own farm closer to Liberty
Hill. Afterward the farmstead likely was home to a series of tenants until the 1930s. Based on the
lack of plumbing, the presence of the outdoor kitchen, and general domestic artifact recovery, it
was probably abandoned sometime in the 1930s or 1940s at the latest. Thus the site has integrity
as a particular type, which is a western Williamson County tenant or sharecropper’s farm of the
late nineteenth or early twentieth century. Sites of this type are often dismissed during surveys
due to lack of integrity, or due to a perception that the data the material assemblages offer is
redundant with what is already known through previous archeological research and written history
(Denton 1999).

However, as the National Park Service points out, “overlooking the significance of small sites may
skew our understanding of past lifeways, as those sites not only receive less research attention, but
also are destroyed without being recorded thoroughly because they are ‘written off’ as ineligible
for listing in the National Register. Such losses point up the need to continuously reexamine
historic contexts and allow new discoveries to challenge our ideas about the past” (Little et al.
2000). It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that Site 41WM1155 is worthy of further
investigation due to its temporal integrity, its concentrated, shallowly buried domestic artifact
scatter, in situ features (one of which is an intact privy and another that could potentially be a
grave site, though none of the archival data supports that idea), and its direct association with a
little-investigated dispersed agricultural community of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is
potentially unique in that it represents a set of intact features and artifacts pertaining to an
important period of regional agrarian development. As a relatively intact farmstead, it is one of the
few remaining vestiges of the Union Hall (aka Matthews, Sewards Junction) community, which
was one of Williamson County’s early frontier settlements. Only a little information is known
about the development of this community; most of the published narrative comes from a single
source-- Scarborough’s Land of Good Water (1973). As a post-1890 tenant or sharecropper’s
farmstead, Site 41WM1155, its history and evolution, appears to be very closely aligned with the
larger community’s. It was on property owned by one of the community founders. Site
development corresponded to a period of changing agricultural practices in that community.
Specifically, it corresponds to the shift from small family farms to larger farms worked by tenants
or sharecroppers. Also significant is that site abandonment likely corresponds to a second wave of
changing agricultural and settlement practices in which that system collapsed after the Great
Depression and the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933.

General research issues that may apply at Site 41WM1155 include community development,
community services, changing farming practices, changing household practices, and socialeconomic mobility issues during these times of social change. Further investigations of the
standing structures may reveal how the house was constructed, altered and modified over time,
reflecting changing resident needs and community services. They could also shed light on
property tenant and owner dependencies and relationships.

Survey revealed that the site contains a varied artifact concentration of household and kitchen
debris around the house and potentially in and around the privy. Test unit investigations could
support not only research into the above-outlined general issues but also specific material culture
choices and personal habits of the residents. For instance, an analysis of the faunal material
known to be present would supply data on food consumption patterns. Did the residents of this
tenant farmstead rely on domestic livestock for their meat, or did they supplement with wild game
such as deer, opossum, rabbit, wild turkey, and fish? If they relied heavily on domestic livestock,
did they obtain meat through a local butcher or did they butcher it themselves on site? Survey
found that the site’s residents appeared to have always cooked using an outdoor kitchen located on
or near the back porch. How was the cooking refuse from this actually discarded around the house
and what does the patterning and type of materials reflect about food preparation choices among
the residents?

Or in another example, how did specific agricultural practices affect the way people organized
their domestic space and how are artifacts distributed across the site as a result? Historical
narrative suggests that the residents of this particular farm likely cultivated corn or hay

47

CSJ# 0151-04-063

Results of Field Investigations

supplemented with livestock, rather than cotton, which is more typical of Blackland Prairie and
similar sites that have been investigated. Do the artifacts and their patterning reflect a different
type of agricultural system practiced here? And can differing agricultural practices be linked to
issues of class or race?
If intact artifact deposits associated with the privies were found, it might be possible to track
household development or specific resident focuses. A high concentration of buttons might
suggest that a female resident supplemented the family income through washing or sewing; a high
concentration of lamp glass might imply that electricity was slow to come this household; or an
unusually large concentration of stoneware storage jars might indicate that a resident engaged in
specific food processing activities. If more than one privy deposit is present and those represent
different time periods, the different assemblages might provide a snapshot of changing household
practices.

These represent specific artifact-driven research questions based on potential artifact scenarios.
Survey results suggesting the presence of artifact remains and intact features indicates that the site
has some potential to provide such data. This information could feed into more general inquiries
not only about the evolution of the Union Hall community, but potentially about race, class,
household maintenance, or rural patterns of mobility and access to goods during two sociocultural
transitional periods at the turn of the century. However, the precise character, density, and
patterning of the artifacts, and whether they can in fact address the research questions cannot be
determined without further testing.

While some previous investigations have dealt with sites of similar type, and from this period in
other communities (eg. Zapata 2001, Clark 2004, Moir and Jurney 1987) no such investigations
have actually taken place in western Williamson county within the Balcones uplift area. Earlier
studies of tenant farms have dealt mainly with cotton farms. By contrast, Site 41WM1155 appears
to have been cultivated with corn and hay and probably supplemented with stock raising.
Moreover, previous studies often fail to link actual artifacts found at sites to broader theoretical
frameworks informed by issues such as consumer choice, gender, and ethnicity. Thus, it is
reasonable to suggest that a fresh approach to the study of a late nineteenth and early twentieth
century household in an almost-forgotten community might yield new historical data, and that
these data could provide a valuable archeological baseline for sites of this type in the region.

In a previous report submittal the investigators recommended that the archeological data coupled
with further archival research and oral history could offer more insight about the Matthews, Ford,
Womack, and tenant families, in addition to the specific development trajectory of the Union Hall
community. Investigators argued that further investigations had the potential to provide not just a
critical context for historical archeological farmstead sites of the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries in western Williamson and neighboring counties, but also the data on the
peculiar local responses and adaptations of a specific community, as well as a unique case study of
a set of intact features relating to specific timeframe. As such, it was argued that Site 41WM1155
could be eligible under Criterion C which assigns significance to an archeological site that is
representative of a particular site type or period; and under and D that assigns significance to sites
that have yielded or could yield important data about history or prehistory. Further archival
research and oral history would establish the site’s significance under Criterion C, during an
important period of development. While this research, together with test unit excavations and
artifact analysis could establish significance under Criterion D. Formal NRHP/SAL eligibility

testing coupled with further research and oral history to determine the site’s eligibility under these
criteria was recommended.
Reviewers at TxDOT, in consultation with the Texas Historical Commission, formally commented
that “any recommendation for NRHP testing requires that the investigators clearly state artifactdriven research questions that pertain to the deposits at 41WM1155 and [that the report must]
explicitly explain how only additional archeological excavation and not the historical record can
address those questions.” Those potential artifact-driven issues have been articulated in
Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of this section. Investigators still believe that further work at the site could
enable archeologists to ascertain whether there are different types of artifacts or whether there is
intact horizontal and vertical patterning (for example in the privy or south and east of the house
where density is greatest) which could address the outlined testing phase issues. In the same
memo, TxDOT further commented that investigation of the concrete enclosure at the site was
warranted to determine whether this represents a possible gravesite. Investigators do not currently
have permission to conduct the necessary backhoe investigations at the survey level, which would
provide more data about the cement enclosure.

Investigators believe that further investigations of the site may have the potential to address the
enumerated artifact-focused research issues relative to the site’s NRHP-eligibility. However, the
outstanding question is whether these research issues are important enough to warrant NRHPeligibility testing, or whether this data would represent redundant information of a welldocumented historical era. What is the degree to which further work at this site has the potential
to provide new or unique information that would further contribute to the historical record of this
time period and region? We submit this revised report to elicit a formal recommendation from
TxDOT and the Texas Historical Commission regarding whether further NRHP-eligibility testing
is warranted at the site.

PALEONTOLOGICAL SITE
The dinosaur footprints, or ichnites, found within the project area are located along the south bank
of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River in the limestone riverbed. This limestone is part of the
Edwards Limestone, which dates to the Lower Cretaceous. The tracks consist of two tridactyl,
three-toed, prints impressed and preserved in the limestone. The tracks are both facing south and
may represent a portion of a trackway (two or more consecutive tracks). Although the tracks have
not been formally documented by a paleontologist, they appear to represent tracks from the group
of dinosaurs known as Ornithopods, bipedal, herbivorous dinosaurs (Kuban 1994). Kuban (1994)
further describes this group as having “well rounded posteriors and relatively short, blunt digit
marks.” Since these tracks are paleontological, they do not meet the criteria for eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP. However, it is the recommendation of the investigators that, if feasible,
construction should avoid disturbing these tracks.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Under TAC permit #4248, Hicks & Company archeologists investigated 283.12 of the 303.77
acres on which the four proposed alternatives of US 183 improvements are located. All work was
conducted under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation At and the Texas Antiquities
Code, in accordance with 36 CFR 800 and 13 TAC 26, which outline the rules and regulations for
compliance. Investigators dug 150 shovel tests in support of the current project. Areas to which
right-of-entry was denied were visually assessed from the existing right-of-way and found to have
low probability for intact cultural resources.

Two new historic sites, 41WM1154 and 41WM1155, and one paleontological site were recorded
as a result of the survey. The paleontological site represents the remains of two tridactyl dinosaur
prints in the limestone riverbed of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River. It is recommended
that the palentological site be avoided by construction, if feasible. Based on the results of the
survey investigations it is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that no further work at Site
41SM1154, is warranted within the APE since it does not contain elements that contribute to the
site’s potential for listing on the NRHP or as an SAL. Site 41WM1154 is a diffuse scatter of
historic debris that is limited to the ground surface. It likely extends outside the proposed APE.
The archeological deposits at Site 41WM1154 within the APE do not contribute to the site’s
potential for NRHP-eligibility under Criterion D, or as an SAL.

Site 41WM1155 is an historic farmstead with standing structures and a dense scatter of historic
artifacts dating as early as the 1880s. Subsurface testing indicates archeological material to a
depth of approximately 20 centimeters below ground surface. A Project Historian evaluated the
standing structures on site 41WM1155 and determined that the structures were ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. Hicks & Company believes that formal testing may yield artifacts features
and patterning that have potential to answer research questions outlined in the Site Summary and
Discussion section. However, it has yet to be determined whether regulators feel that answering
those questions would make the site eligible for the NRHP or as an SAL. Therefore, Hicks &
Company respectfully requests that TxDOT and The Texas Historical Commission provide a
formal recommendation with respect to the need for further testing investigations to determine the
NRHP and SAL-eligibility of Site 41WM1155.

Previously recorded Site 41WM688 was not observed within the APE of the undertaking. It is
recommended that the undertaking will not impact the site. However, should future construction
impact the area immediately east of the current alignment, further survey efforts should be
expended in an attempt to locate Site 41WM688.

It is recommended that no further work is warranted for the alternatives for the US 183 expansion
with the exception of Site 41WM1155. A formal recommendation for Site 41WM1155 is
requested. This report is offered in partial fulfillment of TAC Permit #4248.
