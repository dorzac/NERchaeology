ABSTRACT

The city of North Richland Hills in Tarrant County, Texas, is proposing to realign and reinforce
two segments of existing sanitary sewer line along a tributary of Big Fossil Creek inside the Iron
Horse Golf Course exposed by recent severe flooding. Under contract with the planning and
engineering firm Turner Collie & Braden, Inc., Geo-Marine, Inc., conducted an intensive
archeological survey of two segments totaling 425 linear feet along an approximately 50-footwide corridor (0.48 acre) for the planned relocation and repair of the two sewer line segments.
Survey consisted of shovel testing and examination of the banks and bed of the tributary. Shovel
tests indicated an A horizon of 50 centimeters (cm) or less in depth along the proposed relocation
of the northern segment, and only modern trash was recovered from the fill. The southern
segment will cross the stream below the A horizon, and no archeological materials were observed
along the streambed or in the cutbanks in this location. It is unlikely that the proposed project
will affect historic or archeological properties, and no further archeological investigations are
necessary.

INTRODUCTION
Severe flooding during the summer of 2007 exposed two segments of a sanitary sewer line along
a tributary of Big Fossil Creek within the Iron Horse Golf Course in North Richland Hills,
Tarrant County, Texas. The city of North Richland Hills plans to replace and relocate these two
segments. Current federal and state mandates require cultural resources investigations to meet
legal responsibilities for the identification, evaluation, and treatment of historic properties. These
mandates include Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 due to funding assistance by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The city of North Richland Hills, a political subentity
of the State of Texas, owns both the sewer line and golf course and must be in compliance with
the Texas Antiquities Code. The planning and engineering firm Turner Collie & Braden hired
Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), to conduct the cultural resources investigations (GMI project number
30011.15.01). GMI archeologist Angela Tiné conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the
proposed sewer line relocation on June 3, 2008. Melissa Green, also of GMI, served as Principal
Investigator for the project. The following report documents the methodology and findings of the
survey.

PROJECT SCOPE AND SETTING
The project area is located within a municipal golf course in northeast central Tarrant County,
north of Interstate Highway (IH) Loop 820 and east of U.S. 377 (Figure 1). The golf course is
flanked by recently constructed residential developments, and supporting retail, dining, and other
commercial establishments are located nearby. The project area occurs in a small flood plain
along a tributary of Big Fossil Creek approximately 1 mile (mi) northeast of the confluence of the
tributary with the main channel. Two segments, totaling of 425 linear feet (ft), of an existing
ceramic sanitary sewer line with a diameter of 18-inches (in) are currently exposed and in danger
of contaminating the stream. The longer segment measures 375 ft and extends along the bottom
of the stream.
Concrete bags currently cover the exposed portions of the sewer line (Figure 2). This section will
be removed and replaced with a similar size segment west of the stream at a depth of 6 to 8 ft
(Figure 3). A partially exposed 50-ft-long section of pipeline that crosses the stream
approximately 600 ft south of the larger portion will also be replaced and buried at a depth of 6 ft.
Approximately 40 ft of this segment will be encased in concrete with a steel sleeve. A
construction corridor of less than 50 ft in width will be required, and total area of proposed new
impacts is less than 0.48 acre (ac).
The proposed relocation area for the longer section of sewer line is outside the main golf course
area, and terrain is level to gently undulating (Figure 4). Vegetation consists of grasses and
hardwood trees that separate the golf course from adjacent residences. Several patches of
exposed ground surface provide an average visibility of approximately 30 percent. The shorter
segment that crosses the stream is within the manicured portion of the golf course; however, the
exposed channel provides excellent visibility (Figure 5).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Big Fossil Creek empties into the West Fork of the Trinity River and constitutes part of the upper
Trinity River basin. Environmentally, the project area is located in the Grand Prairie subregion of
the Cross Timbers ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2004). The Cross Timbers is a transitional area
between the prairie regions to the west and the forested low mountains and hills of eastern Texas
and Oklahoma. It extends from central Texas to southern Kansas and consists of irregular plains
with a few low hills and tablelands. Vegetation is a combination of forest, woodland, savanna,
and prairie. The Grand Prairie is characterized by black, calcareous clay soils and by a
dominance of grasses, with shrubs and trees present along stream bottoms and flood plains (see
Yates and Ferring 1986:12-31 for a treatment of the environment of the upper Trinity basin). The
Grand Prairie is supported by limestone and clay formations. The underlying geology of the
project area is composed of undivided Lower Cretaceous formations of Weno Limestone,
Pawpaw Formation, and Denton Clay (Bureau of Economic Geology 1987). Soils within the
project area are mapped as Frio silty clay, frequently flooded. Frio soils are well-drained, deep,
clayey soils in flood plains formed in calcareous recent alluvium (Ressel 1981:91). A typical
profile of Frio silty clay, frequently flooded, is composed of dark grayish brown silty clay from
the surface to about 35 in deep, followed by a grayish brown clay from 35 to 59 in below ground
surface (bs), and then a dark grayish brown silty clay loam ending at 72 in bs (Ressel 1981:29).

CULTURAL SETTING
Despite a long history of archeological research in Northcentral Texas and the southern plains
(Jelks 1967; Krieger 1946, 1947; Prewitt 1981, 1985), as well as several recent summary
overviews (Hofman et al. 1989; Prikryl 1990; Story et al. 1990; Vehik 1994), the chronological
framework for the upper Trinity River basin is not well developed. The available data allow the
delineation of only a generalized chronology. Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and
McGregor 1988) provided evidence for a refinement of the chronology for the Late Prehistoric
period, although the overall regional applicability of the phases recognized there are still in some
dispute. Prikryl (1990) presented a chronological sequence of six periods, but he relied almost
entirely on diagnostic artifacts from surface contexts and comparisons to dated contexts distant
from the upper Trinity River basin. Despite this, chronological data from recent excavations at
Ray Roberts Lake and Lewisville Lake reportedly conform well to his suggested sequence
(Ferring and Yates 1997, 1998). The chronology presented in this report (Table 1) is taken from
the introduction to the regional preservation plan for the Prairie-Savanna Archeological Region,
of which the upper Trinity River basin is a part (Prikryl 1993). Detailed synopses of the
chronology of the area can be found elsewhere and will therefore not be discussed in this report.

METHODOLOGY
Prior to field investigation, documents were examined to better estimate the potential for
archeological sites within the project area. The Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological
Sites Atlas was consulted to determine if any archeological sites have been recorded within 1 mi
of the project area or if any previous cultural resources management (CRM) projects have been
undertaken within this radius. No sites are plotted on the atlas in the search area, and only one
CRM project has been undertaken. In 2004, Prewitt and Associates, Inc., performed a survey
along IH Loop 820, approximately 0.5 mi south-southwest of the present project area. No
additional information was available on the atlas, although the absence of plotted sites within the
highlighted project area implies that none were identified. In 1995, AR Consultants performed a
pedestrian survey of 95 acres within the Big Fossil Creek flood plain immediately outside the
6

search radius, 1.08 mi west of the current project area. No sites were recorded, although
extensive ground surface alterations and limestone bedrock exposure were noted (Trask and
Whorton 1995).
Maps and aerial photographs were inspected to determine the use of the project area through time.
The maps include the 1995 edition of the Haltom City, Texas, 7.5' USGS topographic quadrangle
and 1940 and 1961 versions of the General Highway Map of Tarrant County, Texas. In addition,
aerial photographs taken in 1970, 1973, 1990, and 1995 were examined. The golf course is
present on the 1995 topographic map and on the 1990s aerial photographs; however, the general
region is largely vacant in the 1970s photographs, and no structures are illustrated near the project
area on the highway maps.
Fieldwork for the present project consisted of an archeological survey of the proposed sewer line
replacement. The survey consisted of visual inspection of the ground surface and stream
cutbanks and beds, as well as shovel testing along the proposed relocation of the northern pipeline
segment. All soil was screened through ¼-in hardware mesh, and the results were documented on
a standardized form. The southern segment will be replaced in its original location and extends
across the stream channel. Although not shovel tested, the stream banks and bottoms were
closely examined in this area. Detailed notes and photographs were taken of the project area,
including any disturbances, and all cultural deposits or remains.

RESULTS
Visual examination of the ground surface and creek banks indicated that the surrounding soils
were extremely stony, and limestone cobbles composed much of the bank profiles and eroded
streambed (see Figures 2 and 5), including the location of the southern sewer pipe segment. No
archeological materials were observed in these exposed areas. Buried PVC pipes for an
underground sprinkler system and drainage lines have also disturbed the area around the southern
pipeline segment. Three shovel tests were excavated along the proposed relocation route of the
northern sewer line segment west of the creek (see Figure 3). Shovel test profiles (Table 2) were
similar to the descriptions of the lower A and B horizons of Frio series soils in Soil Survey of
Tarrant County, Texas (Ressel 1981:91–92). Limestone cobbles occurred throughout Shovel
Test (ST) 1 (Figure 6), and the unit was terminated at 40 cm bs due to the difficulty of digging
through the rock by hand. STs 2 and 3 were less challenging, and large quantities of limestone
were not encountered until the B horizon was reached. The only cultural materials recovered
from the shovel tests were pieces of modern trash, most of which appeared to be quite recent and
were probably buried during the flooding in 2007.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No cultural materials other than modern trash were encountered within the project area. The
proposed corridor for the relocation of the northern sewer line segment demonstrates 50 cm or
less of A horizon, and the creek bank in the location of the southern segment is eroded to
limestone cobbles. In addition, this portion of the small tributary to Big Fossil Creek drains
through Lower Cretaceous soils where the potential for buried archeology is not expected.
Construction of the golf course sometime in the 1970s and its continuous maintenance has also
