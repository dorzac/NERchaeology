ABSTRACT
In July of 2018, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted a cultural resources
investigation in support of the Lower Colorado River Authority Transmission Services
Corporation’s (LCRA TSC) T-542 Gonzales to Harwood transmission line upgrade project in
Gonzales County, Texas. The transmission line rebuild will replace all 80 existing support
structures along the 10.1-mile long transmission line with new monopole structures. Previously,
LCRA cultural resources staff had identified approximately 4.6-miles of high probability area that
contain 40 existing support structures. Archaeologists surveyed a total of 4.6-miles within a 100foot wide corridor. In addition, AmaTerra identified 25 water crossings as additional high
probability areas as well as seven locations that were identified pre-field via historic maps as
historic high probability areas (HHPAs). These high probability areas were assessed through
pedestrian archaeological survey and shovel testing. AmaTerra conducted the archaeological
survey under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8484.
Investigations consisted of a thorough pedestrian survey of each high probability area and the
manual excavation of 178 shovel tests throughout the proposed project area. Initially, 111 shovel
tests were dug on high probability areas as a discovery tactic, and an additional 67 were
excavated during site delineation or in the assessment of HHPA locations. AmaTerra documented
three (41GZ257-259) newly discovered archaeological sites within the existing LCRA easement.
Additionally, two previously recorded prehistoric sites, 41GZ175 and 41GZ177, were
revisited/relocated within the T-542 easement. A lack of intact features, dateable materials,
and/or stratified deposits, coupled with poor organic preservation, the horizontal displacement
of artifacts across sites, and adverse effects from both natural and modern disturbances led
investigators to conclude that all five sites (41GZ175 -177; -257, -258 and -259) have negligible
research potential within the surveyed easement. The portions of these sites that are contained
within the existing easement are evaluated as ineligible for listing as State Antiquities Landmarks
and no additional work is recommended.
No artifacts were collected during the survey. All project-related records will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, University of Texas-Austin.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
In July 2018, on behalf of the Lower Colorado River Authority Transmission Services Corporation’s
(LCRA TSC), AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted a cultural resources survey and
assessment in advance of the LCRA’s proposed T-542 Gonzales to Harwood Transmission Line
Upgrade Project in Gonzales County, Texas (Figure 1). The transmission line rebuild will replace
all 80 existing support structures along the 10.1-mile long transmission line with new monopole
structures within the existing 100-foot-wide easement. The project will take place entirely within
existing easement.
Previously, LCRA cultural resources staff had identified approximately 4.6-miles of high
probability area that contains 40 existing support structures. Additionally, AmaTerra identified
25 water crossings as additional high probability areas as well as seven locations that were
identified pre-field via historic maps as historic high probability areas (HHPAs). These high
probability areas were assessed though pedestrian archaeological survey and shovel testing
(Figures 2 and 3). Total acreage surveyed within the high probability areas was approximately 66
acres. Total acreage of the entire existing LCRA easement is approximately 121 acres.
As a political subdivision of the State of Texas, LCRA is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT). LCRA authorized this program of cultural resource investigations to ensure
that significant cultural resources could be avoided during the modernization of the T-542
transmission line and its associated components. AmaTerra’s work conformed to the guidelines
under 13 TAC Chapter 26, which outline the regulations for implementing the ACT.
Field investigations took place in July of 2018, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8484. Tim
Griffith served as the project’s Principal Investigator and James J. Hill acted as the project
archaeologist, while Joshua Zatopek assisted with field investigations. Archaeologists
encountered no difficulties in completing the investigations.
The survey resulted in the identification of three new archaeological sites, designated 41GZ257,
-258, and -259, within the existing LCRA easement. Additionally, two previously recorded
prehistoric sites, 41GZ175 and 41GZ177, were revisited/relocated within the T-542 easement.
Two of the three new sites are prehistoric, and one is historic. Both prehistoric sites (41GZ258
and -259) consist of lithic and burned rock scatters with deposits noted to a meter below surface
along Smith Creek. The historic site 41GZ257 is a series of dilapidated buildings, some of which
are modern and others that are at least fifty years old as well as a scatter of historic artifacts. A
lack of intact features, dateable materials, and/or stratified deposits, coupled with poor organic
preservation, the vertical displacement of artifacts across sites, and adverse effects from both
natural and modern disturbances led investigators to conclude that all five sites (41GZ175 -177;
-257, -258 and -259) have negligible research potential within the surveyed easement. The
portions of these sites that are contained within the existing easement are evaluated as ineligible
for listing as State Antiquities Landmarks and no additional work is recommended.
No artifacts were collected, but all project related materials, such as field forms and photographs,
will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), University of Texas-Austin.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The portion of the LCRA transmission line within the project area is located within the Southern
Post Oak Savanna of the East Central Texas Plains ecoregion (Figure 4). This ecoregion is situated
between two other ecoregions of Texas – the Northern Blackland Prairie and the Southern
Blackland/Fayette Prairie. The East Central Texas Plains region is characterized by irregular postoak plains with parallel ridges and valleys with variations of sands and sandy loams and clayey
soils between the uplands and lowlands (Griffith et al. 2007).

2.1

Climate

The project area occurs within a moist, sub-humid environment (Blair 1950). On average, the
area receives 35.2 inches of precipitation annually and has air temperatures with an average
annual high of 80.6 and low of 57.6 degrees Fahrenheit (AgSite 2018).

2.2

Geology and Soils

The underlying bedrock geology of the Southern Post Oak Savanna subregion consists of
Oligocene, Eocene, and Paleocene sands, silts, and clays (Griffith et al. 2007). According to the
Geologic Atlas of Texas (2018), the project area is underlain by Cook Mountain (Ecm), Sparta Sand
(Es), Weches (Ew), Queen City Sand (Eqc) and Reklaw (Er) formations of Miocene, Oligocene and
Eocene in origin. Recent Fluviatile terrace (Qt) alluvium deposits are present in the southern
portion of the project area around branches of Smith Creek and intermittent tributaries of Artesia
Creek (TWDB 2018). Soils across the East Central Texas Plains ecoregion are commonly acidic and
consist of sands and sandy loams in the uplands and clay and clay loams in the lowlands with an
underlying compact clay pan. Soils in the Southern Post Oak Savanna consist of thermic and ustic
Alfisols and Mollisols with Inceptisols and Vertisols on floodplains (Griffith et al. 2007). Surficial
soils across the Southern Post Oak Savanna subregion consist of clay and sand residue of
Quarternary to Tertiary deposits (Griffith et al. 2007). According to the United States Department
of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) Web Soil Survey (2018), 24
named soil groups fall within the proposed project area (Figures 5-6; Table 1). Of these groups,
the Benchley, Crockett, Kurten, Rosanky, Silstid, Waelder and Zack series commonly occur around
water crossings and their associated landforms, which gives the areas where they occur the
highest potential for cultural resources. Many of these soils are characterized by fine sandy loam
overlying clay. Soils within the project area are 58 percent loams and fine sand with the Rosansky
fine loam and Silstid loamy sand dominating. Clay loams comprise about 21 percent of the soils
and clays comprise the remaining 21 percent and clays (USDA-NRCS 2018).

Hydrology

Located within the Guadalupe River drainage basin, the area is characterized by rolling-to-level
irregular plains dissected by low to moderate gradient streams (Griffith et al. 2007). The sandy
alluvial soils of the rivers and streams throughout the ecoregion support the mesic forest native
to the region. This in turn supports the movement of many faunal species through the area (Blair
1950; Griffith et al. 2007). The project area corridor bisects 25 drainages, which includes
perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral streams. Most of these streams feed into Smith Creek
and Artesia Creek, which eventually flow into the San Marcos River approximately 1.6-miles
southwest of the southern extent of the project area.

Flora

Also called the Post Oak Savanna or the Claypan Area, the East Central Texas Plains was
historically comprised of post oak savanna. Recently, areas in the south have been encroached
upon by mesquite scrub vegetation (Figure 7). The Southern Post Oak Savanna subregion includes
more wooded forest than the adjacent Blackland Prairie due to the support from the region’s
sandy soils (Blair 1950; Griffith et al. 2007). This subregion is currently composed of a
combination of oak-hickory forest, oak savanna, pasture and rangeland (Figure 8). Some thickets
of mesquite, yaupon and eastern redcedar occur in the south (Griffith et al. 2007) where the
project area is located. Common vegetation across the Southern Post Oak Savanna includes
primarily blackjack oak, black hickory, and little bluestem, purpletop, curly threeawn, and yellow
Indiangrass grasses. Yaupon, eastern red cedar, winged elm, American beautyberry, and
farkleberry generally comprise the understory (Griffith et al. 2007).

area is located. Common understory species in the project area include grape (Vitis), American
beautyberry (Callicarpa Americana), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), awnless bushsunflower (Simsia
calva) and sleepingplant (Chamaecrista fasciculate) among other shrubs (USDA-NRCS 2018).

2.5

Fauna

The project area falls within the Texan Biotic Province of Texas as described by Blair (1950), which
was assigned to designate the broad ecoregion in between the forests of east Texas and
Oklahoma and the grasslands of the western parts of the states. Mammals that occur across the
Texan province include the white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), nine-banded armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), raccoons (Procyon lotor), bobcats (Lynx rufus) (Blair 1950; Griffith et al.
2007), eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), the swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus)
and rodents such as the eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), baird’s
pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Geomys breviceps), white-footed
mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), ground squirrels
(Marmotini spp.), hispid pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus
maniculatus), prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) and various species of birds, snakes and turtle
in riparian zones (Blair 1950). Historically, jaguar (Felis onca), ocelot (Felis pardalis), red wolf
(Canis rufus), gray wolf (Canis lupus), black bear (Ursus americanus) and mountain lion (Puma
concolor) were once common throughout the region.

CHAPTER 3: REGIONAL CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The project area is situated in the borderlands of several archaeological regions as defined by
Perttula (2004) (Figure 9). The current T-542 easement it located entirely within the South Texas
region but is in close proximity to both the Central Texas and Savanna and Prairie regions
(Perttula 2004:7), though the southern Post Oak Savanna is archaeologically more closely related
to the Central and Southeast Texas archaeological regions (Fields 2004). Typically, cultural
chronology in Texas is divided into four major periods of time: Paleoindian (16,000–8800 years
before the present [BP]), Archaic (8800–1200/1300 BP), Late Prehistoric (1200/1300–250 BP),
and Historic (250 BP–present) (Prewitt 1981). While the Prehistoric Periods are principally
defined by the presence of diagnostic projectile points and other technologies, they are intended
to order cultural change and are thus somewhat arbitrary; cultural change proceeded at
somewhat different rates over the vast area of Texas. A regional chronology of the Paleoindian,
Archaic, Late Prehistoric and Historic periods are detailed in the following sections.

3.1

Paleoindian (ca. 16,000–8800 BP)

The Paleoindian period was characterized by cooler and wetter climatic conditions than today.
Paleoindian peoples practiced unique subsistence patterns that consisted of hunting now extinct
megafauna and foraging from local plant resources (Black 1989; Mauldin et al. 2003). Early
Paleoindian materials in the form of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview projectile points began to
enter the archaeological record at the end of the Pleistocene Epoch. These points were
lanceolate-shaped and fluted for hafting to wooden spears. Using the launching momentum from
atlatls, large game such as mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and horse were frequently taken
(Black 1989). In addition to megafauna, Paleoindian groups also subsisted on less daunting prey
including antelope, water turtles, badger, and frogs, as well as native plant resources
(Waguespack and Surovell 2003). Stylistic changes in projectile point technology occurred during
the later portion of this subperiod, eventually shifting to the Late Paleoindian subperiod defined
by Clovis, Folsom, St. Mary’s Hall, Golondrina, Scottsbluff, Angostura, and the Wilson type
projectile points in South and Southeast Texas (Bousman et al. 2004; Hester 2004).
Notable Paleoindian sites near the project area include the Wilson-Leonard, Gault, Pavo Real,
and Berger Bluff sites. In addition to these excavated sites, numerous instances of Paleoindian
projectile points have been documented in unstratified surface deposits throughout Central,
South, and Southeast Texas. Environmental studies suggest that Late Pleistocene Epoch climates
were wetter and cooler (Mauldin and Nickels 2001; Toomey et al. 1993) during most of the
Paleoindian Period with a gradual shift to drier and warmer conditions at the onset of the Early
Holocene Epoch (Bousman 1998). As megafauna gradually died off, inhabitants of Central and
South Texas shifted their subsistence patterns towards smaller game and an increased reliance
on plant foraging. This cultural change is visible in the archaeological record and marks the onset
of the Archaic Period.

3.2

Archaic Period (ca. 8800–1200/1300 BP)

The Archaic Period, which lasted approximately 7500 years, is divided into the Early, Middle, and
Late Archaic subperiods (Collins 2004). This period signifies a shift away from megafauna to
smaller animals, a more intensive reliance on plant resources, an increased use in ground stones
for food processing, a decrease in residential mobility, the systematic burial of the dead, the use
of stone cooking technology, and an increase in woodworking tools (Yelacic and Lohse 2011).

3.2.1

Early Archaic

The Early Archaic subperiod (ca. 8800–6000 BP) is characterized by “very low population density,
small band sizes, highly mobile, and extremely large territorial ranges” (Black 1989:49). This
behavior may be attributed to the arid environment (Hester 2004), as this climate required
inhabitants to be near water. For the South Texas archaeological region, Thomas Hester
(2004:136) divides the Early Archaic into two horizons: early corner-notched and early basal
notched. The early corner-notched horizon has corner-notched dart points with recurved or
notched bases. These point types include Martindale, Uvalde, Baker, Bandy, and Gower dart
points, and Guadalupe tools. The early basal-notched horizon is characterized by dart points with
deep basal notches, large bulbs, and distinctive long stems. Point types include the Bell and
Andice dart points. Additional tools associated with this horizon include early triangular bifaces
and large unifacial Clear Fork tools.
The Southeast Texas archaeological region shows a similar chronological change in stone tool
types. Story (1990) points out that there is a distinct sequence of dart point types in Southeast
Texas, which includes early side-notched and early stemmed forms and corner notched Keithville,
Neches River, and Trinity type points. This is followed by a transition to the Bell/Calf Creek,
Tortugas and Wells points later in the Early Archaic (Ricklis 2004).

3.2.2

Middle Archaic

Dating from about 6000–4000 BP, the Middle Archaic subperiod is marked by the onset of the
Altithermal, a long episode of warming and drying (Meltzer 1999). This subperiod is also
associated with a shift in subsistence to a greater reliance on plant resources (Black 1989; Hester
2004). In South Texas, tools associated with the Middle Archaic include Abasolo, Bulverde, Lange,
Morhiss, Pedernales, and Tortugas projectile points, unifacial distally beveled tools like the
Nueces tool, and marine shell ornaments and tools. Reliance on plant resources is evident
through “an increase in formal hearths, earth ovens, and burned rock accumulations” (Hester
2004:139), as well as the presence of ground stone tools, such as tubular stone pipes, grinding
slabs, and manos. Projectile point types associated with the Middle Archaic period in Southeast
Texas include Yarbrough, Bulverde and Travis with Pedernales points common in the western
portion of the region (Ricklis 2004).

Late Archaic

The Late Archaic subperiod dates from ca. 4000–1200/1300 BP. Kent and Gary make up the
dominant dart point types associated with the Late Archaic in Texas, with Ensor and Godley types
common in the far western portions of the Southeast archaeological region (Ricklis 2004). Late

Archaic sites in Southeast Texas show a shift to the utilization of more local lithic source material
that is of poorer quality, which signifies a reduction in group mobility and more spatially
restricted territories (Story 1990). Another line of evidence showing reduction in group mobility
is the increase in cemeteries in South and Southeast Texas. One prominent example is the Ernest
Witte site in Austin County that contained over 200 individuals spanning the Middle and Late
Archaic. Burials that dated to the Late Archaic contained a wide variety of grave goods that
includes Ensor and Fairland dart points, corner-tanged knives, groundstone “boatstones,” a
gorget, bone pins, and conch shell beads and pendants. Large cemeteries with grave goods
become increasingly common in the Late Archaic, and the fact that the same types of grave goods
are found with both male and female burials suggests a somewhat egalitarian social organization
(Ricklis 2004).

3.3

Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1200/1300–250 BP)

The transition from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period in Texas is marked by the
advent of the bow and arrow, ceramics, and in some places, agriculture. Artifacts associated with
the Late Prehistoric period in the Central and South Texas regions consist of Scallorn, Edwards,
Perdiz, and Starr, and Zavala arrow points, as well as arrow shaft straighteners (Hester 2004). The
Toyah Horizon, which dates from ca. AD 1300–1700, is a well-documented Late Prehistoric
cultural pattern that spans Central and South Texas. The Toyah Horizon is often associated with
bison hunting practices. Assemblages have Perdiz arrow points, end scrapers, flake knives,
beveled knives, bone-tempered pottery, perforators, shell ornaments, and bird bone bead
artifacts (Hester 2004).

3.4

Historic Period (250 BP–Present)

Europeans first entered what is now Texas in AD 1528 when members of the Panfìlo Narvàez
expedition washed ashore in Matagorda Bay. After this initial landing, the Spanish visited only
sporadically, and did not settle in Texas until around AD 1700 (Webb 1952). In response to the
continuous threat of Apache and Comanche raiders, as well as the French incursion into East
Texas, the Spanish erected a series of missions and presidios in Texas during the eighteenth
century. In 1820, the newly independent Mexican government began granting empresario
contracts to Anglo Americans to encourage settlement and development in Texas. It was these
land grants that brought the first permanent white settlers to what would become Gonzales
County.
The first Anglo-American settlers in Gonzales County came to Texas as part of Empresario Green
C. DeWitt’s land grant. DeWitt’s land grant was approved by the Mexican government in April
1825, and that same year he appointed James Kerr to select and survey a town site. Kerr chose a
place at the confluence of the San Antonio and Guadalupe Rivers, about one mile east of the
present-day location of the City of Gonzales. Within three years over 100 families had settled in
DeWitt’s colony (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016).

By 1831 Gonzales had a population of 532 but was still vulnerable to Indian attacks, which
prompted the Mexican government to send a six-pound cannon to the settlement for defense.
DeWitt’s Colony sent delegates to the Conventions of 1832 and 1833 and to the Consultation of
1835. The Mexican government considered these to be acts of treason and thus sent troops to
retrieve the cannon in September of 1835. On October 2, colonists repelled the Mexican troops’
efforts to take the cannon in what became known as the Battle of Gonzales. This was the first
armed conflict of the Texas Revolution (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016). A year later Gonzales
was once again at the center of the Revolution. The Runaway Scrape began when Sam Houston
arrived in Gonzales on March 11, 1836, and after learning of the fall of The Alamo, ordered a
retreat to the Colorado River. He also ordered all inhabitants to retreat with him. It was not until
Texan victory at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21 that settlers began to return to their homes
(Covington 2016).
Organized in 1837, Gonzales was one of the original counties of the Republic of Texas, with its
boundaries encompassing the entirety of DeWitt’s Colony. After Texas was annexed to the United
States in 1845, parts of the county were detached to form parts Caldwell, Comal, DeWitt, Fayette,
Guadalupe, Jackson, Lavaca, and Victoria Counties. Most early settlers set up farms in the fertile
Guadalupe and San Antonio River valleys. By 1840 cotton and corn were the chief crops produced
in the county, though cattle farming also became increasingly important through the 1840s and
1850s. Many of these farms were fueled by slave labor; by 1850 slaves made up 40 percent of
the county’s population (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016).
By 1860 Gonzales County had a total population of 8,059, of which 3,168 were slaves. On
February 23, 1861, citizens of Gonzales overwhelmingly voted for secession. Twenty-two
volunteer companies were formed from Gonzales County and joined the Confederate Army
(Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016). The population of Gonzales County increased after the Civil
War as settlers moved in from other southern states. From the 1870s through 1900 railroads
played an important part in the growth of the county. In 1874 the Galveston, Harrisburg, and San
Antonio Railway was built through the northern and eastern part of the county. A branch line of
this railroad was built into Gonzales in 1882. In 1877 the Texas and New Orleans Railway built
into the county as well. The new mobility offered by railroads led to a rise in population and the
number of operating farms in the county (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016).
Cotton and corn became important cash crops in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, with cotton reaching its peak production in 1920. Fluctuations in the prices of these
cash crops made farmers who relied too heavily on them susceptible to economic ruin, which
resulted in high levels of tenant farming in the county. At its height in 1930, tenant farmers
worked two-thirds of farms in the county (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016). After 1920 beef
cattle farming once again became economically important for Gonzales County. Poultry farming
also became an important industry in the 1920s and 30s. Farming declined throughout the
second half of the twentieth century while the cattle and poultry industries grew. Today Gonzales
County is still largely rural and farming and ranching form the base of its economy. As of 2014
the county had 20,462 people (Baumgartner and Vollentine 2016).

Previous Cultural Resource Investigations

The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) was consulted to identify previous surveys and
recorded cultural resources. Research focused on the identification of archaeological sites,
Registered Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), sites listed as SALs, sites listed on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP), cemeteries, and archaeological surveys within one kilometer
(0.62 mile) of the project area (Figure 10). According to the Atlas, the transmission line corridor
has not been previously surveyed except for a short, 1-km long, segment immediately north of
Gonzalez. However, in 1981, LCRA conducted a survey of the closely parallel T-173 line (Kenmotsu
1981) and recorded five sites (41GZ175-179); this survey is not mapped on the Atlas. Two of these
previously recorded sites are within, or very close to, the current 100-ft wide easement corridor.
Site 41GZ175 is a small scatter of prehistoric lithics and burned rocks; the site was recorded in
1981 and no further work was recommended (Kenmotsu 1981:8) but no determination of SAL
eligibility is on file with the Atlas. The second site, 41GZ179, is a scatter of prehistoric lithics and
burned rocks measuring about 350 m by 200 m in size. The site was recorded by Kenmotsu (1981)
and again in 1993; in 2010 it was determined to be ineligible (Atlas). Several other prehistoric
sites are located within 500-ft of the proposed centerline but will not be affected by the rebuild
(see Figure 10). In addition, the southernmost 3.3 miles of the corridor is within the extensive
Cuero I Archaeological District.
Review of historic aerial photography and maps shows that historically the area has always been
rural. The project area extends from an LCRA substation about 1800 ft south of US 90 in Harwood
and proceeds in a south-southeasterly direction with no inflection points to a point about 1400
ft north of E Highway 97 in Gonzales. The transmission line crosses Gonzales County within an
existing utility easement and consists of rural and historically cultivated agricultural land. The
primary built environment feature historically close to the project area is the Gonzales Branch of
the Southern Pacific railroad, located approximately1.2 miles east of the existing T-542 easement
(Figure 11). A 1940 Gonzales highway map indicates the immediate area surrounding the T-542
easement had begun to become more developed, however typically few home sites existed away
from the major highways which included US 90 and the then Farm-to-Market ([FM] 29) (Figure
12). Aerial photography from 1952 shows increased development in the area, with the presence
of additional access roads and structures associated with nearby ranches and farms as well as
the urbanization of the City of Gonzales. (Figure 13). The presence of what is now portions of the
T-542 transmission line (formally a transmission line owned and operated by Central Power &
Light Co.) on the photographs indicates its construction is at least 50 years old and thus likely
never surveyed. An examination of more recent USGS maps indicate the Gonzales branch of the
railroad was incorporated into the modern version of the Southern Pacific Railroad as indicated
on a series of 1962 and 1964 USGS 7.5 quadrangle maps. Similarly, FM 29 had been expanded
upon during this period and renamed US 183 (Figures 14–15). Recent aerial photographs do not
show a significant increase in development or housing construction around the project area.

CHAPTER 4: METHODS
Prior to field investigations, archaeologists conducted archival research to assess the potential
for historic-period archaeological materials. This research involved examining historical maps and
aerial photographs. In addition, archaeologists consulted the Atlas (2018) to assess the potential
for previously recorded archaeological sites within the project area, as well as a review of
literature on archaeological sites within the region (for example: Kenmotsu 1981). This allowed
investigators to identify previously recorded archaeological sites adjacent to or within the project
area, and provided insight into site types, site settings, artifact assemblages, and average depth
of cultural materials below the ground surface. Lastly, the project area limits were overlaid on
aerial based gridded maps and loaded onto hand-held GPS units to aid in navigation.
Field work was conducted from July 9-13, 2018. The archaeological survey conformed to survey
standards set forth by the Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA). Approximately 4.6 miles of the
transmission line were designated as having high potential for archaeological deposits. LCRA and
AmaTerra cultural resource staff previously identified 40 transmission poles and 25 water
crossings that pass through the project area. Additionally, seven locations were identified prefield via historic maps as historic high probability areas (HHPAs), totaling 72 high probability
locations overall. Survey included visual inspection and shovel testing of each of the locations
identified within the high probability area. Additionally, archaeologists drove or walked along
nearly the entire length of the transmission line to give visual inspection to areas designated as
low probability.
In general, each high probability transmission pole location was visually inspected and subject to
two shovel tests within the proposed footprint of the replacement poles (Figures 16). In some
cases, fewer than two shovel tests were excavated if the location showed concise evidence of
ground disturbance. Occasionally more than two shovel tests were excavated at or near a
replacement pole location if the terrain looked particularly favorable for containing
archaeological sites. At water crossings, at least one shovel test was excavated on each side of
the stream. In areas where streams paralleled the transmission line, one shovel test was
excavated every 30-50 meters (Figure 17). For the purposes of this survey, an archaeological site
was defined as containing a certain number of cultural materials or features older than 50 years
within a given area. The definition of a site was: (1) five or more surface artifacts within a 30-m
radius, or (2) a single cultural feature, such as a hearth or burned rock midden, observed on the
surface or exposed during shovel testing, or (3) a positive shovel test containing at least three
total artifacts, or (4) two positive tests located within an individual structure’s footprint. Shovel
tests measured 30 cm in diameter and extend to a maximum depth of one meter below surface.
The shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm increments and all soil was screened through a ¼-inch
hardware cloth. Shovel tests were backfilled upon completion. Relevant information for all shovel
tests was be recorded on a standardized form and shovel test locations were marked with
handheld GPS units.
All archaeological sites identified within the project area during the survey were investigated by
means of no fewer than six subsurface tests to define site boundaries within the LCRA easement.
Similarly, six shovel tests were excavated in each of the previously recorded sites that were either

revisited or that were shown to extend into the previously un-surveyed T-542 easement. Specific
site information was recorded in the field through field notes, hand-drawn maps, digital
photographs, and GPS points. This information was later recorded on standardized forms and
presented to TARL for inclusion in their archives and assignment of new site trinomials. Any
artifacts found either on the surface or in shovel tests were catalogued and photographed in the
field and returned to their original locations. No artifacts were collected during the survey.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
A total of 4.6-miles (7.4-km) were surveyed as part of the T-542 Gonzales to Harwood
transmission line upgrade project (Figures 18-21). The survey was comprised of approximately
4.6 miles (7.4 km) of existing easement previously designated as high potential. A total of 178
shovel tests were excavated as part of the field efforts (Appendix). Typical shovel tests measured
approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and extended no deeper than one meter below
surface. Variability within shovel tests was based largely on localized field conditions including
areas of disturbance, soil types, bedrock, etc. Shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm increments
and all material was screened through a ¼-inch hardware cloth. Relevant information for all
shovel tests was recorded on a standardized form and will be curated at TARL along with all other
documentation associated with the project after the final report is submitted to LCRA.
Field efforts identified three previously unrecorded archaeological sites (see Figures 18-21).
Additionally, two previously recorded prehistoric sites, 41GZ175 and 41GZ177, were
revisited/relocated within the T-542 easement. In general, sites identified within the project area
had a minimum of six subsurface tests excavated to define site boundaries relative to the study
area. Specific site information was recorded on standardized forms and has been submitted to
TARL for inclusion in their archives and to obtain new site trinomials. All artifacts were field
catalogued and returned to their original locations as per LCRA requirement that no artifacts
were to be collected during the survey. A discussion of each site is found below.

5.1

Site 41GZ257

Site 41GZ257 is an abandoned historic period home site located in an overgrown lot immediately
adjacent to FM 794 (Figure 22). As viewed on aerial photography, the site measures about 85
meters (east to west) and 50 meters (north to south). The site contains the remains of at least
five dilapidated buildings including a modular home, the remains of an older wooden dwelling, a
possible carport/garage and at least two associated outbuildings, as well as an associated surface
scatter of historic artifacts that stretches an additional 80 meters to the south. In total, the site
covers approximately 0.95 acres within the existing LCRA easement. Only portions of three
buildings are located within the current easement and they are located approximately 90 meters
north of proposed structure location number 359.
Ground surface visibility ranged from 25–75 percent throughout the site area and was higher on
the remains of the gravel driveway that leads into the dilapidated buildings. A total of six shovel
tests were excavated within the recorded site boundary in order to determine the extent of
subsurface material associated with the site. The shovel tests encountered compacted soils and
large cobbles at a depth on average of ten centimeters below ground surface. Three of the six
tests were positive with glass and building debris fragments just below the surface. Based on the
lack of any soil deposition, investigators judged that visual observation, detailed recording and
historical research were adequate to define site content and boundaries. Current site boundaries
are limited to the LCRA easement, but the site extends well beyond the confines of the current
easement as denoted by the building remains.

Nearly all the artifacts were observed on the surface and were in direct association with the
building remains. Historic artifacts included shards of amethyst, aqua, amber and colorless glass,
in addition to whiteware and stoneware ceramics, a multitude of metal fragments including wire
nails, screws and fasteners, countless amounts of building material including milled lumber,
corrugated tin roofing and concrete.
The large, partially destroyed modular home contributed much of the modern trash that was
exhibited throughout the site (Figures 23–25). A great deal of the material observed on the site,
including several ID and credit cards exhibited dates spanning the late 1980s and early 1990s,
suggesting the modular home was inhabited into the latter part of the twentieth century. This
further suggests the majority of the material observed at 41GZ257 is modern and therefore not
subjective to SAL eligibility standards. However, the site contains the remnants of at least four
older buildings that pre-date the modern modular home as well as historic artifacts noted
throughout the site.

An Archaeological Examination of the T-542 Transmission Line Upgrade, Gonzales County, Texas

Although varying in sizes, each of the four buildings is constructed of conventional 2 x 6-inch
milled lumber, with corrugated metal roofing and wire nails. Remnants of a bedframe and couch
were noted within the largest of the four buildings hinting at the likelihood that this was the
house structure within the residential complex (Figure 26 and Figure 27). Similarly, several old
rubber tires were noted within the one of the two larger structures indicating this was likely
utilized as a garage or carport of some sort (Figure 28). The two smaller outbuildings are much
lower in height, measuring only about 5–6 feet tall. Their size and shape indicate they were likely
utilized as some sort of storage shed associated with the two larger structures (Figures 29 and
30). A great deal of modern trash and debris is also associated with the buildings, suggesting the
structures were likely re-purposed at some point throughout their life history as potential storage
space or as a dump site after the modular home was abandoned. The sizes, shapes, building
material and accompanying artifacts suggest the four historic buildings were constructed
sometime in the early part of the twentieth century.

A structure is plotted in close proximity to the location of 41GZ257 on a 1940 Gonzales highway
map and likely represents a structure associated with the site (see Figure 12). Presumably, this
indicates that at least portions of 41GZ257 are at least 75 years old. Gonzales County deed
records show the Central Power and Light Company (CP&L) acquired the easement through this
parcel from William and Sadie Gracey on October 13, 1926 (Figure 31). The document is a
contract notarized by Zeb V. Nixon, the public notary of neighboring Caldwell County at the time,
granting CP&L permission from William Gracey to utilize his property to help establish a new
transmission line across his property for the sum of 50 dollars. The CP&L transmission line
mentioned in the documentation would later go on to be absorbed by LCRA and become part of
the T-542 easement. However, it is unclear from the documentation if 41GZ257 was at one time
owned or occupied by the Gracey’s or if the four structures were even constructed at the time
CP&L was granted the easement. In all likelihood however if the structures were occupied at the
time of the lease agreement between CP&L and Mr. Gracey, there would be some sort of mention
of 41GZ257 since the new CP&L line would be constructed immediately over the residential
structures and therefore would be compensated as such (of which there is no mention). Taking
all this information into account, it is likely the buildings associated with 41GZ257 were
constructed sometime after the easement was agreed upon in 1926 and before the Gonzales
County highway map was commissioned in 1940.
Overall Site 41GZ257 is a residential remnant containing architectural features that potentially
range between approximately 90 to 75 years in age. Investigators have concluded the modular
home and the modern trash associated with the site have heavily damaged the overall integrity
of site. Nonetheless, the remnants of at least four additional structures are located within or
clearly visible from the existing T-542 easement and therefore establish the assessment of
41GZ257 as a historic site. Historical research suggests that this site was constructed after the
easement was established by CP&L in 1926 and before the Gonzales County highway map was
commissioned in 1940. Conclusive evidence however is elusive that links the site to the Gracey
family mentioned in the deed research and if a residence was present at the time the easement
was established.
Overall, 41GZ257 lacks integrity, as the multiple building features reflect multiple periods of
ownership/use and indicates clear modern disturbance. There are no artifacts that would
enhance site interpretation or the larger narrative of the already rich county history surrounding
Gonzales County. Lastly, none of the features have particular uniqueness or architectural merit
that would raise the site to the level of National Register-eligibility. Therefore, Site 41GZ257 is
not recommended eligible for listing as a SAL. Further investigations are not warranted.

Site 41GZ258

Site 41GZ258 is a buried prehistoric lithic and burned rock scatter. It is located on a slightly eroded
interfluvial ridge overlooking the south bank of Smith Creek. Consisting entirely of lithic artifacts,
the site measures approximately 0.75 acres and was defined within LCRA easements entirely
through shovel testing, geographic boundaries and project constraints (Figure 32). The right-ofway is dominated by Croton grass and Dove Weed and is flanked on both sides by a moderatelydense forest of Live Oak, post-oak, Elm and Pecan trees (Figure 33). No work was done outside
the easement.
According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), soils within the site area are affiliated with
two named soil groups. These consist of Benchley/Crockett clay loam with one to three percent
slopes and Waelder loam with zero to one percent slopes. Typical Shovel tests placed within the
site area encountered brown (7.5YR 5/4) sand that overlays strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay at
depths that range from 70 to 100 centimeters below surface (cmbs).
Site 41GZ258 was encountered through the excavation of shovel tests around the base of
proposed structure location number 305. Fifteen shovel tests were placed to define the site area,
ten of which contained cultural material. One hundred and sixteen pieces of lithic debitage along
with thirty-nine pieces of FCR were recovered from depths that ranged from 0–100 cmbs in a
sandy stratum that was consistent throughout the site area. The majority of lithic artifacts were
recovered from between 0–40 cmbs and consist of cortical and tertiary flakes. The lithic
assemblage consists of raw materials such as: mottled gray chert and translucent red and brown
cherts that were sourced to chert gravels observed within Smith Creek and elsewhere.
Positive shovel tests at 41GZ258 are located throughout the existing LCRA easement including
along both the eastern and western extremes of proposed transmission pole number 305
footprint. This information suggests that prehistoric materials associated with the site likely
extend outside of the project area. No features, diagnostic artifacts, dateable materials, or
organic remains were noted within the recorded site boundary. The density of the subsurface
deposits, especially in the 0-40 cmbs range, could indicate the site may extend beyond the
recorded site boundary, outside of the right of way, as determined by the horizontal deposit of
artifacts disseminated throughout the site. However, an abundance of bioturbation, mostly in
the form of rodent burrows, was observed across the landform indicating stratigraphic integrity
of the site is largely absent. Therefore, investigators conclude that the cultural deposits
associated with 41GZ258 located within the existing LCRA easement are ineligible for listing as a
SAL and recommend no further work.

Site 41GZ259

Site 41GZ259 is a buried prehistoric lithic and burned rock scatter located in close proximity to
41GZ258. The site is located along an eroding interfluvial ridge on the north side of Smith Creek.
Consisting entirely of lithic artifacts, the site measures approximately 1.80 acres and was defined
entirely through shovel testing, geographic boundaries and project constraints (Figure 34). The
right-of-way is dominated by Croton grass and Dove Weed and is flanked on both sides by a
moderately-dense forest Live Oak, post-oak, Elm and Pecan trees (Figure 35). No work was done
outside of the existing LCRA easement. As such, the site extends in both directions. Additionally,
41GZ176, a previously recorded prehistoric surface scatter is located only 30 meters west of the
southern extent of 41GZ259 and could indicate a larger, more expansive site.

According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), soils within the site area are affiliated with
two named soil groups. These consist of Silstid loamy sands with one to five percent slopes and
Waelder loam with zero to one percent slopes. Typical Shovel tests placed within the site area
encountered brown (7.5YR 4/3) sand that overlays strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay at depths that
range from 60 to 100 centimeters below surface (cmbs).
Site 41GZ259 was encountered through the excavation of shovel tests around the base of
proposed structure location number 306. Twelve shovel tests were placed in the site area, nine
of which contained cultural material. Seventy-seven pieces of lithic debitage along with five
pieces of FCR were recovered from depths that ranged from 0–100 cmbs in a sandy stratum that
was observed consistently throughout the site area. The majority of lithic artifacts were
recovered from depths between 0–20 cmbs and consist of cortical and tertiary flakes. The lithic
assemblage consists of raw materials such as: mottled gray chert and translucent red and brown
cherts that were sourced to chert gravels observed within Smith Creek and elsewhere.
Positive shovel tests at 41GZ259 are located throughout the existing LCRA easement including
along both the eastern and western extremes of proposed transmission pole number 306
footprint. This information suggests that prehistoric materials associated with the site likely

extend outside of the project area. No features, diagnostic artifacts, dateable materials, or
organic remains were noted within the site boundary. The density of the subsurface deposits,
especially in the 0-20 cmbs range, could indicate the site may extend beyond the recorded site
boundary, outside of the right of way, as determined by the horizontal deposit of artifacts
disseminated throughout the site. However, an abundance of bioturbation, mostly in the form of
rodent burrows, was observed across the landform indicating stratigraphic integrity of the site is
largely absent. Therefore, investigators conclude that the cultural deposits associated with
41GZ259 located within the existing LCRA easement are ineligible for listing as a SAL and
recommend no further work.

5.4

Previously Recorded Sites

Two previously recorded sites (41GZ175 and -177) were investigated as part of the T-542
Gonzales to Harwood Transmission Line Upgrade Project. Both sites were recorded in 1981 by
Ray Kenmotsu as part of the LCRA T-173 transmission line survey (Kenmotsu 1981).
41GZ175 was initially recorded as a lithic and burned rock scatter situated on a sandy rise amidst
a dense post oak woodland and originally plotted within the existing CP&L transmission (now the
LCRA owned T-542 easement) (Kenmotsu 1981:8). Upon revisiting the site, AmaTerra personnel
excavated six shovel tests within the original site boundary as plotted on the Atlas. Of the six
shovel tests, only one was positive with a single tertiary flake recovered 20 cmbs.
41GZ177 was initially recorded as a widely dispersed scatter of lithic debris consisting mainly of
core fragments and primary reduction debris (Kenmotsu 1981:10). The site exhibited a high
degree of erosional disturbance as it is situated on a steep, eroded slope south of the Dry Fork
drainage. Originally plotted outside of the T-542 easement, a sparse scatter of lithic debris
consisting of approximately ten pieces of lithic debitage was observed within the current
easement. As such, the previously recorded site boundary was expanded in order to encompass
the current findings. Six shovel tests were excavated within the newly defined site boundary, all
of which were negative.
Both 41GZ175 and -177 are recommended as not eligible for listing as SALs. The absence of any
diagnostic or otherwise dateable cultural material as well as the minimal potential for the
incidence of intact subsurface deposits led AmaTerra personnel to conclude that future research
potential of the sites was exhausted during the site revisits.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND MANAGEMENT
RECOMMENDATIONS
AmaTerra surveyed and tested 72 locations within the high probability areas totaling
approximately 4.6 miles in length for the proposed T-542 Gonzales to Harwood Transmission Line
Upgrade Project in Gonzales County, Texas. The survey included 4.6 miles of high probability
areas containing 40 locations of existing support structures previously identified by LCRA cultural
resource personnel, 25 water crossings identified jointly by AmaTerra and LCRA staff and seven
locations that were identified pre-field with the assistance of historic maps as historic high
probability areas (HHPAs). Access was available to the entire proposed project area and
archaeologists did not encounter any conditions that inhibited the survey. AmaTerra conducted
the archaeological survey under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8484 and work conformed to the
guidelines for implementation of these regulations under 13 TAC Chapter 26.
During the survey, archaeologists excavated 178 shovel tests including 111 tests as a discovery
tactic on survey and an additional 67 tests to delineate sites and to thoroughly examine the
HHPAs. Within the existing easement, archaeologists recorded three previously unrecorded sites.
Additionally, two previously recorded sites, 41GZ175 and 41GZ177, were revisited/relocated
within the T-542 easement. Within the sites, archaeologists excavated 45 shovel tests; of which
24 contained subsurface materials. The prehistoric sites along Smith Creek averaged between 70
and 80 centimeters above basal clay whereas soils within the historic site were shallow, averaging
approximately 10 to 15 centimeters above basal clay.
The newly recorded sites include two prehistoric sites and one historic site. The historic site
(41GZ257) is a series of dilapidated buildings, some of which are modern and others that are at
least fifty years old as well as a scatter of historic artifacts. Both prehistoric sites (41GZ258 and 259) consist of lithic and burned rock scatters with deposits noted to a meter below surface along
Smith Creek. No temporally diagnostic items or features were observed on either of the two
prehistoric sites.
All sites were evaluated using criteria outlined under 13 TAC 26. A lack of intact features, dateable
materials, and/or stratified deposits, coupled with poor organic preservation, the vertical
displacement of artifacts across sites, and adverse effects from modern disturbances led
investigators to conclude that all five sites (41GZ175 -177; -257, -258 and -259) have negligible
research potential within the surveyed easement. Within the existing easement, none of the sites
have any potential to contain significant information pertaining to the prehistoric period of South
or Central Texas. The lone historic site lacks integrity and none of the features have uniqueness
or architectural merit. Similarly, though both prehistoric sites (41GZ258 and -259) have buried
deposits observed at least to a meter below surface, both lack stratigraphic integrity largely due
to an excessive amount of bioturbation noted in abundance across both site boundaries.
Investigators concluded the portions of these sites that are contained within the surveyed
easement are evaluated as ineligible for listing as State Antiquities Landmarks and no additional
work is recommended.
