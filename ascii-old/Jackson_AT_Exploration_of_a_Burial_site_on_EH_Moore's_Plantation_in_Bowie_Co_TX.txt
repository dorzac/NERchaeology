TEXAS

Escavated Augu.st 12, 1932 to September 2, 19)2 by A. T. Jackson
and Crew.

We

w~re

forced to camp at the foot of the levee.

mch evening, shortly

before dark, an aerial attack was staged against our camp by thousands of
mosquitoes, armed with long bills.
This site includes a cemetery where, in 1902, an overflow uncovered
some 12 or 15 vessels; a ditch some 100 yards west, where, in 19}1 some
human bones were exposed; a mound about 65' diameter and 5 feet tall, with
r hu / i:l/1;q
a large depression beside it -where dirt was removed"'~·/of md. #1; and
a small midden mound some 50' south of the mound mentioned above..
md 40' S.W. of latter with hole.
Surface specimens from mound No. l were as follows:
1-mussel shell :pierced for ba,fting
2-4-deerbone flaking tools
5-deerhorn flaking tool
6-Pottery disc with hole in center
7-arrov1:point, small (point broken)
8-abre,ding stone .
9-arrowpoint, small
10-end of conch shell
11-small bammerstone

An examination of several gallons of surface potsherds indicates-

that most of the pottery at this site was tempered with crushed shell.
A

f&N

sherds were tempered with coarse sand and some with charcoal or

lignite.
1'fu,ny of the shell-tempered sherds bore such an excessive amount of
shell as to show very prominently on the surface.

Such sherds rarely

bear any form of incised decoration -- the showing of shell apparently
being considered as furnishing sufficient decoration or beautification.
Another very elementary form of decoration was the making of
fingernail indentations in the plastic clay.

A small number at this

site were so decorated.
A S'tudy of surface potsherds, gathered from the midden mound No. 2
shows the following:

resulting in angles where curves were intended.

Preliminary Testing
:Before deciding at 'tlhich of the several likely places intemdve
work would be done, it was deemed best to first do some :preliminary
testing.

Work was started adjacent to the spot where pots washed up
:But, when tvrn days' work by the entire crew showed up nothing

of interest, the scene of ouera tions was shifted some few hundredx yards

-7-

to a strip of level land adjoining mound No. 1.

At that spot fragments

of human s<lmll were to be seen on the :plowed surface.

The total finds

at the second location consisted of a dog burial, and a shallow human
burial badly disturbed 1?Y the plow.

DOG BURI.AL.
At a distance of about 150 feet east of mound No. 1, was
a dog burial.

It was in a crumpled :position, as if a small hole

had been dug and the dog skeleton

cr~mmed

into it.

Skeleton in

excellent state of preservation, except that left half of lower jaw
missing, ribs and hind legs missing.
Some four inches above the head were several fragments of a
bowl.

This may or may not have been buried with the dog.

8 miles west of Atlanta,

BURIAL J-i
A human burial, disturbed by the :plow, was found at a distance

of 6 feet S. of E. of the dog burial.

There is a probability that the

dog accompanied the human burial, and, that the broken vessel may have
be.en near feet of the human skeleton.
Bearing uncertain due to disturbance by plow.

Effigy

.An unusual redware animal effigy, broken from the rim of

some vessel, was in the midden deposit, near the center of the
mound, at a depth of 33".
The right side of the effigy( tov;ard inside of vessel)

bulges

very little; while the left side of the animal head bulges out some

bas a horizonal gash or groove just above what appears to

represent an ear.
On top of the flat head are two pointed nodes or "horns".

A

portion of the nose is missing.
This is the first case found in East or Northeast Texas of a
redware rim-effigy.

But there can be no mistaking it, since it bears

a polished, shiny red slip.

Comparative ages of :Bu.rials.
The finding of lead slugs in burial J-3, of course, labels
this burial as post""'.'Columbian.

It is interesting to note that

there were no vessels accompanying this historic burial.

Also

that the site was occupied long enough after the burial for a
thick ash and midden deposit to be formed above a portion of the
grave;

From this fact it would seem that burial J-3 was made in

very early historic times.
Although nothing showing contact with the white race was found
in burial J-2, it seems probable tl1at this burial is little, if
any, older than J-3.

Bu.t if the burial on its side is to be

taken as an indication of a latter-day custom

(and the Womack

site in Lamar Co., Texas, confirms this Tuloores site find) then
it may be questiQned as to whether burial J-2 - being extended
on back - was not :made at an earlier date.

The presence of pottery

in J-2 would not prove a prehistoric burial, because in a grave
on Mrs. Emma Owens farm near Frankston, Anderson Co., Texas, a
clay pipe and pot accompanied a steel knife blade.

Also pottery

was present in a grave on Clements farm in Cass Co., Texas, along
with glass trade beads; and on Womack farm, Lamar Co., Texas.

The sp-foot space between postholes designated

Posthole C, at the N.W. corner, probably was to hold a

to

an extension to the roof --an overhanging

shelter or "porch" that shaded the entrance from the afternoon sun,
or from rain and wintry blasts of wind.

Dense Midden

Deposit

At depths of 35n to 39u, in black midden soil, and covering
an area of approximately 7' x 10', were found numerous artifacts.
Among them were nru.ssel shells (small) with tiny holes drilled
near the thick edge --apparently strdng with beads.
The~e

were arrowpoints shaped as follows:

At a depth of 2 on was a tiny flint arro.rpoint shaped as~­

~

follows:

Bone beads, appa,rently rm:i"de of

ones of turkey or other fowl,

were about 1n long and well polished.
A number of flaking tools, ma.de of the ulna of the deer, were
present in the midden deposit.
Several so-called flaking tools made of the ends of deer antler
worked dovm were also found in this midden deposit.
Among the many potsherds from the midden deposit was one of :particular interest both because of its excellent workmanship and the design
engraved on it.

It was a black ware bearing an extra fine polish --al-

most approaching a glaze.

Both interior and exterior show same high

polish.
The design was a sun symbol as follows:

Another semi-concentric circle presumably representing the

Although arrowp6ints were comparatively few, a goodly number
of flint and chert chips were present in the dense midden deposit,
intermixed with bones, mu.ssel shells, etc.

Conch Sb.ells
Only one conch shell bead was found in the general digging.
(Also one in burial J-8)
The presence of these two beads and the end of a conch shell
on the surface, bespeak some trade with coastal tribes.

There is,

however, a striking contrast between these few evidences of the use
of conch shells here and the thousands of beads and number of whole
conch shells at T,M.Sanders mound, Lamar Co., Texas.

On a petsberd, from a depth of 23n, was an intricately engraved
design, combining the sv_n symbol and :interlocking scroll as follows:

Adnl t skele~on containing lead slugs or musket balls, showing

buri~l. (See T.11.Sanders grou:p bur. 1931).
Children's graves showed no signs of contact with whites.

6.

Skeletal and other material in fairly good state of preservation-due :partly to good drainage and ashes.

7.

Few vessels and other artifacts accompanied the burials.
typical of the Red River area.

This is

8. Most of vessels were near the heads and shouiders.
9.

One vessel was beneath a skull. This is unusual, and a contrast
to the few cases where vessels were directly on top of skull.

10.

One child's skeleton was :partly beneath another - labeling the
deeper one as an older burial than the other.

11.

The adult was buried. on side -- an indication of recent burial,
which was confirmed by findipg of lead balls.

12.

Children's graves beneath the floor of hut.

13.

There is a possibility that so many graves of children may bespeak an epidemic among the you.th of the village.

14~

It seems unlikely tr~,t this was a ceremonial mound for the initiation or :puberty ritual of youths for two reasons: (a) Presence of
bodies of infants not more than 2 or 3 years of age; (b) Abundant
evidence of the mound having been used for living quarters, which
would :preclude exclusive use for ceremonial pu.r:poses.

15.

Presence of children's graves migfrt :possibly be attributed to
sacrificial offerings such as practiced by Natchez Indians.

16.

One of the few midi:-len mounds containing burials.

17.

Some graves ·had ash pits above, showing that mo1md occupied after
the burials.

18.

Site at ~present a considerable clistance from W1'1ter; bTtt there was
once a lake near·oy - and probably the 1:9J;:e resulted from a cut-off
of Red River in its constant shifting d.uring flood.s.

A lower mound located about 50 yards S.W ~ of mou..11.d we

came.

22.

Unusu.ally large amou....'lt of e,shes and charcoal

23. One of the most outstanding features of the site was the
presence in a charred state, of various food articles; preserved in ashes. They included pecans, acorns, beans, Hickory
nuts, corn, ~rass seeds, and seeds resembling sunflower, okra,
and squash. ~Pecans in graves and midden - all others in middena.)

24.

Presence of some animal, fowi, fish and terrapin bones, but not
in large quantities such as found·on L. L. Winterbauer farm,
Wood Co., (notes 1930) and on A.C. Saunders farm, .Anderson Co.,
(no·tes 1931).
.

2 5.

Absence of buffalo scapula hoe blades - or other buffalo bones.
This indicates that buffalo feasts were rare here - if indeed
they occurred at all.

2 6.

.A few mussel shell 11 hoes" or ntrowels" were foru1d in midden
de:posi ts, bu:f none in graves - as found in Cass Co. , Texas.

(notes 19 32, G. Hunt e,nd Clements sites).

27.

Absence of stone hoe blades, such as found on J. Q• .lVJ.ahaffey
farm 3 miles N. of Leary and less than 10 mi.les from this site.

2 8.

Scarcity of all kinds of stone vm:rk at this site as compared ,
with abund.8,nce of such material at ]JTahaffey site, Bowie Co.

The particular scarcity of arro"Npoints as compared with the
number· of flaking tools
there being more of the la:~ter than
of the former. See #50.

Presence of a few ( 6) very small mussel shells pierced for use
as pend.ants or beads. Uw.1sual.

34.

Consistent with absence of conch shell beads in quantity
was total absence of conch shells in the mound and only a
fr~ament of one on the surface.

Split-reed matting, preserved in deposit of ashes and charcoal. Very unusual - being only case so far fou..'Y].d in N."E.
TeYJ;J,s where matting was preserved.

41.

Five pipes fou...~d in south portion of the mound - none in other_
:parts of· the mound. Mone with a. burial, all being in midden
deposits. (check map as to exact locations of the pipes). This
apparent presence of a :pa'.rticular artifact in a localized portion of the mound calls to mind a similar occurence in mo1.J~nd on
L.L.Winterbauer farm, near ~'Uitma.n, Wood Co., Texas. (See notes
1930).

42.

Presence of a broken clay tubular·pipe in the midden deposit
recalls the statement of Joseph D.. IvicGuire, in Pipes ~ Smoking
Customs of .American Aborigines, (.An. Rep. Sm. In. 1897, Vol. 1.)
to the effect that the tubular pipe was the first pipe used by
the Indians and is very ancient. If that be always true, then
we have in this one mound evidence of both early and late occupancy -- the :presence of a tubular pipe and two lead balls. J3ut
this find appears recent being in upper level. With further
reference to the tubular pipe, it is interesting to note tbat a
stone tubular pipe vras found on the old Mitchell farm some two
mile-e- southwest of the E; H. ~.foores mound -- just a few days
after the find at Moores.

44.
Presence of a redware so-called 11 frog' effigy on a potsherd in
midden deposit. Effigies bearing red slips are ver;/ rumsual.
This type of effigy is also unusual. (See #47)
45.

Vlhile mussel shells were present in small numbers all thru the
midden, there were no large and deep deposits of htmclreds of
mussel shells -- such as present at T.M.Sanders farm, Lamar Co.,
Tex. (See notes 1931).
-

46.

Presence of two bear teeth in good state· of ~preservation. One
shows evidence of a broken-out bead-hole. A third tooth, ·much
langer, drilled at· lower end for use as a bead or pendant. All
in midden deposits. (See #33).

47.

Few red slips as contrasted with many at T. ILI. Sf!,11ders site,
Lamar Co., Texas (See notes 1931) See #44.

48.

Eoth numbers three and four appear as magic numbers; but
number four is niost common. This presents another contrast
to T.M.Sanders site, Lamar Co.
·

49.

Presence of a :pot ~"l,ndle of the rattle or "tambourinen type,
similar to those from Russell Bros. farm, Titus Co., J.M.Riley
farm, Upshur Co., and I>Irs. J. M; Cook·farm, A..'1derson Co.,--all
of which site~ are nrach further south.

50.

The presence of so many so-called flaking tools, as compared to
the few arrowpoints found here, si.:tggests the possibility that
these bone implements may have been used for other purposes -such as awls, mat-weaving implements, etc. fut it would seem
that the awl theory is e::tploded by'the fe,ct that few of the implements have st.i.ar:p ends. See #2. 9.

51.

Presence of 13 pottery discs, most of them with holes drilled
in center, and in various stages of !D8,nufacture, presents several
questions: Is there some connection between these so-called
ngame-discsn and the presence of so many children's graves in
this mol.md? Were the discs used as spindle whorls? Were they
used in games similar to our quoits? Were they used as arrowshaft polishers? Or were they used as hair-dressing discs? Some
of them could ha.rdly have been used as s:pindle'whorls, due to the
holes going thru at an angle. :But :perhaps those few were incomplete - as is one without any hole. They could have been used in
dressing the hair - by ru..nning hair thru the·hole, then coiling
it around the disc. Prof. Dellinger of Univ. of Ark., at Fayetteville, has a stone disc with hole in center - about the size of
the Texas :pottery discs - which he calls a .:h...a.ir-dressing .device.
s·ee reference to pottery discs in Harrington' s "Certain Caddo
Sites in Ar~mnsas." Utilitarian purpose is suggested by the almost universal presence of the discs in midden deposits. ·

52.

Pre.sence in a child's grave of a long, well•made bone needle or
awl·raises a question as to whether or not it may have been a
toy. E"at it seems more likely a funerary offering of an adult
to the deceased child.

5?.

Shaped ends of deer antlers raises a question as to whether they
were used as flaking tools. Points seem most too blunt. Barry
