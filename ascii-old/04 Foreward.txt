Foreword
The Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society was organized in Abilene, Texas, in
October, 1928, for the purpose of collecting the archeological remains of Texas, their preservation in
Texas museums, and the publication of the knowledge acquired in the studies and researches incident
thereto. It was also intended that the remains of such types of prehistoric animals as have been found
associated with man’s artifacts in other parts of the world should be carefully studied and collected in
museums with the idea in view that a more careful study of American pleistocene deposits might
yield evidences of earlier occupation of America by man than had been previously acknowledged.
The members of the Society feel that the efforts of this organization have contributed no small
part to the solution of many of these problems, and especially that of ancient man in America.
From the printing of The Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society’s Publications neither
officers nor editor nor anyone else derive any financial compensation whatever. All of the proceeds
of the dues payments, and book sales are applied to make better, larger bulletins. It is a successful
experiment in pure science. The Society published its first book at the beginning of the depression in
1929. It has been published regularly every year since then. For several years the Society has owed
no debts, and it maintains a cash balance prior to publication for the printing of its Bulletins.
