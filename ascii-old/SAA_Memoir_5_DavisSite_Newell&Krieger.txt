accounts of their names, approximate locations,
and political structure have been published by
Bolton, Swanton, and others. Numerous names,
with variations in spelling, have been given to

this group of tribes. The French called them
Cenis; the Spaniards, Hasinai or Tejas. These
names were usually applied to the confederacy
as a whole, but occasionally to a specific tribe
or village. It is sufficient here to mention only

two: the Nabedache, the most southwesterly

group, among whom the first East Texas mis

who lived just across a river (presumably the

Neches River) from them.

very little data concerning locations of the ab

doubt. Bancroft4 places the point of landing at

Matagordo Bay, from which de Vaca traveled
northwest, never crossing the Colorado River.

Bandelier5 places the landing at about the

mouth of Sabine River, from which point de
Vaca went nearly straight west to the Brazos

these works in locating tribes and missions
greatly limits their usefulness. The second

group includes the works of Bolton, based pri
marily on original sources, some of which had
not been previously brought to light. He was
the first to give quite definite locations for vari
ous tribes and missions in eastern Texas. Group

At about the same time, de Soto explored the

Moscoso, probably entered well into eastern

An interesting matter concerns soil color.
The mounds lie some distance inside the well
known "redlands" section of East Texas, on
the Nacogdoches soil of the Norfolk group.

These soils are characteristically red due to the
weathering of iron-rich beds such as the Weches
Glauconite.20 Carter21 also describes these soils
as being red; fragments of ironstone (commonly
called Weches concretions) were found through

pieces of Spanish pottery found near a spring in one of the

ravines cutting the slope a few hundred yards southeast
from the mound. The lead balls and Spanish ware were

sufficient to show that regardless of where the

first missions actually were, they were not
located near the mounds southwest of Alto,

Texas. I think it probable that they were in the
southeast corner of Houston County, possibly
on what is now called Hickory Creek. If so, the
early missions would not have been nearer than
some 25 miles to the mounds under discussion.

[Newell completed these lines before Swan

Hasinai missions were constructed is more
open to argument than ever before. Newell's
points are all aptly taken and emphasize the
difficulties and inaccuracies attendant upon
location work from documentary sources with

the crest of a high ridge overlooking the San

north. There is no Indian site thereabouts, only
a tiny spring. Such a location is completely out
of keeping with known villages of the Hasinai,
these being on or near the tillable valley floors.
In the second place, one cannot believe that the

Despite these and other objections, there are

some reasons for thinking that Mission San

in the confluence area of San Pedro Creek and

when compared with heavily lenticular structure of primary mound (as c, d, e). From bottom to top are: (1) soil layer,
(2) thin layer of sand and clay, (3) ash and humus (white lenses), (4) mound wash (darker shade), and (5) pure sand at

the top.

c. Profile of Line 11, same direction as a, 5- to 10-foot level below surface. The primary mound top can be seen through
length of profile, as in a. Such heavily lenticular construction above this line was, however, unusual in the secondary
mound. The more homogeneous secondary mound material appears on Line 12, above and cut 10 feet back (top of

the general village detritus, and some were
overlain by later house outlines. The entire
area about the mounds is now covered by a
layer of sand, probably a relatively recent
accumulation. This is particularly true of the
south part of the site, which is to leeward of the

mound during strong north winds. The occur

be due to the continual plowing during the years

of sand accumulation, which would keep the

village material thrown to the surface.

No definite entranceways were found, with

When an outline had been roughly estab

out slightly and photographs were taken. A
trench was then dug around, and just outside of,

the outline and its inner wall cut back by thin
vertical slicing until all postholes were exposed
in profile (Fig. 16, e). Measurements and plots
were then made. Fireplaces and centerposts, if
present, were also profiled.

Half of the outlines lay in areas shallow

noted in the individual feature discussions,
there was no apparent attempt to space the

posts regularly, distances between them varying
within each structure.

Size and depth of postholes varied greatly.
Diameter ranged from about 0.17 foot to more

than 1.0 foot, averaging a little more than
0.5 foot. The depths of postholes undamaged

by plowing ranged from 1.0 to 3.2 feet.

Some of the postholes were found when a
depth of about 1.25 feet below surface was

reached, but more than half of them were not
uncovered until about 1.67 feet below surface.

ment the structures were exposed to natural
weathering for a sufficient length of time to

destroy all occupational evidence except the
outline. In the case of the house set in a pit,
it is highly unlikely that weathering sufficient

to remove every trace of a floor would have
failed to remove the well-defined fireplace

present, which was filled with soft, loose char.

It thus seems probable that weathering, or

plowing, or both, were responsible for the de
struction of floors and fireplaces in all instances
except one where it is indicated that, for some
unknown reason, all debris on the house floor

was deliberately and carefully cleared away

sometime prior to the filling of the pit, leaving

only the fireplace and the posthole outline
showing.

Fireplaces showed extreme variation from
mere shallow depressions to very well made
round firepits lined with packed and smoothed
clay, burned hard by later fires (cf. Figs. 16, c
and 18, f). Fireplaces were found in 14 of the
34 outlines, always approximately in the center
(Fig. 12, c). Usually they showed signs of use,

but occasionally did not. Artifacts were only
infrequently found in the ashes and char which
generally filled the firepits, the usual contents
being burned sand, a few flint chips, and often
small bone fragments.
Pits were present in eight structures, were
roughly oval in shape, normally rather large,

and ranged from one to as many as nine within a

single outline. They can hardly be called storage

pits for almost without exception they were

barren of refuse and artifacts. Rather, they were

filled with a hard, compact clay, giving the
impression of having been emptied and then
deliberately packed with sterile clay. The pits
extended into the compact red clay underlying
the entire site. Occasionally the walls and floors

showed long vertical or diagonal grooves,

suggesting that the pits were dug by driving

respect, to that used among the Tejas, as

described by early Spanish travelers; i.e., a
large central support was used during construc

tion, but was not a permanent part of the house.

After the long posts had been set along the

house perimeter, one or two workers climbed
the centerpost and, by use of a hooked stick,
pulled the tops of the wall posts to the center

where they were tied, thus forming a "bee
hive" shaped structure. The centerpost was

then cut or burned off.1 The central postholes
found in our excavations were large, averaging
a little less than a foot in diameter. In two in
stances the "centerpost" holes proved to be the
tap roots of large pine trees, but since they were

at almost the exact centers of their respective
outlines, it can be inferred that in these cases
living trees were utilized as temporary center

posts.

Inner posts were present in nearly all struc
tures, but only occasionally did their arrange
ment give any definite suggestion of partitions,
or props for beds, benches, or shelves. They were

usually scattered in seemingly aimless fashion
around the interiors (Fig. 12, d).

The only evidence of the material used to
cover the houses was a small fragment of
switch cane matting. This was found in an

isolated posthole, was very badly burned, and
little could be learned from it, but it appeared
to be woven.

Few houses were distinctive enough to war

rant a detailed discussion. The majority differed

only in minor ways and are briefly described
below. One group of 10 outlines (Features 10 to

18) was so intermingled as to be almost in
separable and is described as a unit. In cases
where one outline was superimposed on an
other, they are discussed together. The houses

than ashes, although a few small sections were
solid enough to be saved. A round fireplace was
uncovered under the burned material. This was
2.7 feet in diameter and 0.3 foot in depth at its
center, sloping up to the edge (Fig. 18, e). The
firepit was filled with char and a few ashes,
possibly from the burned material above, and

contained a few small flint chips. It showed
only slight evidence of burning in and below
the pit, and had no prepared clay lining. Later

excavation showed no centerpost below it.
The entire area was then cleaned off at the

level of the fireplace. The only suggestion of a

definite floor consisted of a small section of
hard, baked clay at the southern edge. This was
somewhat similar to the floor of Feature 9, but

thinner and less cracked and broken. At the
outer edge of this clay "floor" was a short
raised section of hard burned clay, about 4.0
feet long (Fig. 21, f). This looked as if it might

have formed part of a rim around the structure.

If these did constitute part of a floor and rim,
all the rest had been destroyed at some previous
time. In the raised section of burned clay were
several burned posts of red oak (Quercus rubra)

and chinquapin (Castanea pumila, which were

very small and shallow, set entirely in the "rim."

When the area had been cleaned off at the

few feet outside of these was another circle

composed of three long, barren trenches, and
parts of a more continuous, meandering trench.

The meandering trench contained 102 post

holes averaging somewhat less than 0.4 foot in
diameter and 2.2 feet in depth. A section along
the south part of this trench contained an addi
tional row of small posts just outside the main

row. The postholes in this trench were very

faint and only in rare instances could they be
traced to the top of the trench. This same con
dition was found in the trench around Feature

9, and has been discussed in connection with
that structure. There were also postholes in four
short trenches which were set in four spaces
formed when the meandering trench cut in to
ward the center for short distances (Fig. 20).
At the north edge of the structure were four
extensions which projected from the main out
line nearly at right angles. Three of these were
continuations of trenches which formed part of
the outline, but one was a separate trench. All

the extensions contained postholes, but both

trenches and postholes were only about half as
deep as those in the main outline.
At the east and west sides of the structure

were two long trenches, set just outside the
main trench. These were filled with the same
crumbly, reddish-brown soil found in the other

trenches, and were approximately the same

width and depth. They contained neither arti
facts nor postholes.

was nothing in the other trenches nor in the

Not much can be said to identify this struc
ture. Why the barren trenches were dug, only
to be filled in with sterile clay, cannot be an
swered at this time. The large amount of work
involved in digging such an elaborate series of

deep, narrow trenches in a hard, compact

clay, and the symmetry of the whole structure
suggest a definite purpose and a carefully car
ried out plan. Presumably it served a ceremonial
function, but beyond that one can hardly even

speculate.

The field profiles were carefully studied for

The reader should first examine Newell's
contour map of the site (Fig. 4), showing the

peculiar L-shape of the complete mound, the
grid system of numbered squares, and the posi

tion of the numerous house outlines. The

central area, more or less square, bounded by
the heavy line, represents the excavated portion
of the mound for which profiles were drawn. The

foot of the mound at the time of excavation ran

farther south and north than this central block,

trench walls (Figs. 3, d; 6). Although it was

length, the more detailed analysis carried on
with the zone system and artifact correlations

reveals a more complex history. I must em
phasize that the original profiles, made in
painstaking detail, did not distinguish any
actual or potential stratigraphic lines in favor

of others; hundreds of lenticular bodies and
lines between clays of different colors were

drawn as equal. Nonetheless, as will appear in a

Newell's field profiles were taken across the
mound excavations as they proceeded westward
from the mound base at the eastern end (Fig. 3,
d) . The first profile was made along Line 10, from

point L6 to R9, and another made each 10 feet
until Line 21 was reached. As termination of
the whole project was imminent at this time, it
was not possible to strip the next squares down
to the sub-mound village level; Profiles 22, 23,
and 24 were plotted so far as they were cleared,
but not to the full width between Lines L6 and
R9, and not to the bottom of the mound. The
profiles for Lines 22, 23, and 24 have therefore

not been included in Figure 26 although it
should be mentioned that the physical stratig

position in two or more successive profiles. This
gave a theoretical picture of stages of construc

to determine which of these had real cultural

weight. In such cases where the profile lines

could not be followed through completely, the

lines are broken in the figures. The zones

themselves may now be considered briefly.
Zone 1 is the old village lying entirely under

the mound at its maximum extent when ex

they are important for other reasons. The

flat-topped temple mounds, with several stages
of construction, had to be built after at least
one of the small mounds, Zone 2, was already on
the site, and conversely, at least three of the

houses (Features 31, 37, and 38) were under
neath Zone 2 and had to be built before the

latter existed. Therefore, within the excavated
leg of the complete mound, Features 31,37, and
38 had to be built and abandoned before Zone
2 was erected, and this in turn, had to precede
the construction of the first flat-topped mound,

Zone 6. The cultural content of Zone 2 was
exactly the same as that of Zones 3, 4, and 5, as

well as Feature 31 (and presumably Features
37 and 38 although they contained very few
objects of any kind); hence we are on firm
ground in regarding this part of the site as
representing the first occupation. With this as a

start, other houses can be brought into the

first occupation, as discussed in the section on
cultural stratigraphy.
Zone 6 was the first flat-topped mound to be

built here, so far as we know. It forms an

unmistakable stage of construction, appearing
with about the same height, width, and slopes
in seven of the profiles shown (Lines 15 to 21,
inclusive). It continued toward the other leg of
the mound, appearing in Profiles 22, 23, and 24

also. Since the eastern foot must have been

between Lines 14 and 15, the flat top of Zone
6 was not less than 90 feet long. At the eastern

end, in Profile 15, the flat top was about 28

feet wide, the base 62 feet wide, and the height
about 8 feet. Tracing Zone 6 through Profiles
16 to 24, the flat top was uniformly 25 to 28
feet wide and the base between 51 and 60 feet

wide. Variations in steepness of the slopes
mainly account for these discrepancies. The
southward slope (toward the left in Fig. 26) is
seen to be somewhat less steep than that to the
north (or right). Zone 6 was therefore a long,

narrow, rectangular mound. In Profile 21, a
wide, low platform appears on the southward
side. This was quite flat, some 40 feet wide, 3
feet high, and at least 20 feet long, disappearing

Since we do not know how much farther

along the eastern leg Zone 6 and the bench run,
we cannot tell whether the bench was near the

middle of this initial flat-topped mound, or
near its western end. Neither can we know
whether the L shape of the completed mound
was due to the meeting of two such long and
narrow rectangular eminences as Zone 6. It can

be seen that the long axis of Zone 6 did not
coincide with the axis of this leg of the L;

instead, it ran in exactly the same direction as

the excavation grid lines, or northwestward

rather than west. Therefore, if the other leg of

the L was also formed by a long, narrow,

rectangular mound like Zone 6, these probably
met at something less than a right angle. The
bulge of the eastern leg over Features 31, 37,
and 38, was not a third mound around a plaza,
but resulted from later additions to Zone 6.1
1 The contour map, Figure 4, shows that the completed

mound was more than an L, the eastern leg bulging out
ward toward the south, then its side curving inward toward
a narrow neck between Lines 24 and 30. Sr. Pedro Armillas,
an authority on Mexican archaeology, visited the site with

me in March, 1947 and expressed the opinion that the
mound as a whole resembled a form found in Guerrero;
that is, a block U formed by three rectangular mounds
around a square plaza, with the fourth side open. The low
in-curved area between the legs of the L does suggest a
small plaza, rather than a broad erosion gulley, as Newell
thought. The present analysis of the profiles definitely
shows that the bulge was formed, not by a third mound but

by an addition to Zone 6, discussed under Zone 7. Also,
Zone 6 would not have met a similar rectangular mound
under the other leg at right angles unless the latter also
failed to follow the axis of this leg, a problem only answer
able with further excavation. Thus, we can envisage a sort
of plaza enclosed by rectangular mounds on only two sides:
Zone 6 to the north and a similar structure to the west

under the unexcavated leg of the mound. The wide low
bench on the side of Zone 6 would have faced this "plaza."
This is particularly interesting in view of the strange build
ing with the intricate maze of trenches and walls (Feature

35, Fig. 20), which would have been in this "plaza" and
only about 30 feet south of Zone 6. Other buildings (Fea
tures 30, 33, and 41) could have stood in this area at about
the same time, but Features 42 and 45 were covered by

Zone 6 and therefore existed earlier.

the profiles of Lines 15 to 21, inclusive. Lines

15 and 16 show a considerable number of

lenticular bodies of clay added to the northern
side of Zone 6 (to the right in the profiles), and
a much smaller number added to the southern

to the right side are smaller and only slightly
greater than those to the left. Another heap of
clay, labeled Zone 7a, appears in Lines 17 to 19,
far out to the right, but seems to connect with
Zone 7 in Line 17; it may have been the begin
ning of still further enlargements such as Zones
8 and 9. Its artifact content agrees with that of
Zones 7 to 9, hence it seems not to have been a
separate mound like Zones 2 to 5. Along Lines

Zone 6 to make the top of Zone 7 level.

and therefore does not appear in the tabulations but there is no way to determine how much.
Zones 15 and 14 showed no notable differences
(Tables 3-18).
Zones 13 to 16 apply to the non-mound area
in artifact content, hence even though 15
includes mixed cultural material, it can hardly
and do not conform to physical strata. They

were created as an expediency for tabulating
artifacts from the fields surrounding the mound.

The difficulty is this: the pre-mound village
formed a thick, level stratum running com
pletely under the mound and out into the fields

as far as excavation was carried; the mound,
on the other hand, rearing high above the vil

lage, sloped down to it on all sides. The pre

mound village, due to these slopes, was covered
more thickly about the mound base than it was
farther out in the fields. The modern surface
of the site was not level, sloping very gently

upward to the 15' contour line (Fig. 4), then
gradually more and more steeply up to the
secondary mound sides. Therefore, artifacts

be segregated. Our main reliance, then, for a
cultural and stratigraphic distinction in the
field remains, must be in Zone 16. As will be
shown in the discussions of cultural change
within the site as a whole, the mound will pro
vide the control.

3 Another example of the archaeological obsession with
standardization. Recording from dead levels, often in the
teeth of good stratigraphy, is called "standard" field tech
nique which will overcome errors and uncertainties, etc.
While control is one thing, it should not entirely rule out

the application of common sense on occasion. Let me

ible distinctions between them, but Features 37

and 38 contained very few objects compared
with Feature 31 (Tables 15-16). Features 42 to
45 were also round houses built on the sub
mound village. Feature 45, like Feature 31,
was an extremely large building, had several
cache pits in the floor, and otherwise closely
resembled it except for the "room" added on
the east and south sides (Figs. 24, 15). Although

Feature 45 was not overlapped by any of the

Although it is difficult to distinguish closely
between these "zones" in the profile sketches
(because all lens lines were drawn equal), this
is not of crucial importance since the cultural
material proved to be the same from all of
them.
Completely covered by Zone 7, we find the
core of the primary mound to have been a
long and narrow, rectangular, flat-topped
mound which continued beyond the last ex
cavated sections. This mound, Zone 6, in turn

mounds in a group (Fig. 27, a). Zone 6 covered
only Zone 2; the others, Zones 3 to 5, were
probably contemporaneous with 2 but were not

covered until Zone 7 was added (Fig. 27, c).
All four round mounds were built upon the
old village which completely underlay the great
L-shaped mound. Zone 2, furthermore, partially

larly partly covered by Zone 6 and had to

precede it. Features 43 and 44 lay farther off
to the northeast and were not covered by any

part of Zone 6, although Zone 7 did overlap
their edges. Theoretically, then, Features 43
and 44 need not have been built before Zone 6

was complete, but only before the fills of Zone 7
were added. However, they did not differ from
Features 31, 37, 38, 42, and 45 in any significant
details or in artifact content, and it seems safe
to include them with the occupation of the old

village before any mounds, rounded or flat

Feature 9 presents a special problem, dis

an idea based on my mental picture of the situa

Feature 35 stood south of the group of four
rounded mounds; if built after Zone 6, it stood
approximately south of the wide bench on the
side of that flat-topped mound; or, it might have

been built during any subsequent accretions,
for only the mound wash finally covered it

(Fig. 4). Possibly even, in connection with Zones
6 or 7, Feature 9 stood to the north, while the
undoubtedly ceremonial chamber, Feature 35,
stood to the south simultaneously.

the latter group in Phase 2. The inclusion of

Features 10 to 18 in the first phase may possibly
serve to counterbalance the element of error in

the phase percentages. Naturally, such a move
could not be made if the cultural content of

that types with historical meaning will only be

such materials did not fail to be preserved.
Burials must have been made somewhere in
the vicinity, and the high conical mound across

the road (Figs. 2; 3, r) certainly could not ac

had been made, the calcined bones would have

been found.
Although the lack of burials removes one

at types of broad application. The usual alterna

tive is to abandon the broader aspects of the
problem (if indeed they were ever considered)
and settle back on the local situations, thereby
endlessly creating new "types" without much
regard for what happens to them in the long
run. The most effective solution which comes
to mind is that the annual meetings of archaeo
logical societies all over the land devote a part
of their time (or extra time) to the bringing to
gether of potential type material demonstrating
supposed ranges of variation; and that they then
work intensively on defining effective types with

ranges of variation which suit the facts of dis
tribution in time and space. Meetings of this
kind have been held but never, so far as I know,
expressly to tackle the variation problem on a

broad scale.
For some time I have been strongly con

long-time committees. Granted that the matters
touched briefly here are difficult, they cannot
be called impossible of solution without our ut

A very similar situation has been published
for Marksville period pottery in the Crooks
site, central Louisiana. Here we learn, for ex

ample, that a total of 11,620 sherds of Marks

levels, against 817 Marksville Stamped, 271

98.3, and 77.4; in other words, from a minimum
of over two-thirds to a maximum of practically
all the sherds from each section or level.9

In these and similar cases which might be

cited from many areas, it would be extremely
instructive to know what proportion of the actual

vessels was undecorated. Although it is nowhere

stated that the "plain types" consist of all

plain sherds from the sites, this is implicit in

given, but this is not improbable, and at any

rate a re-alignment of ceramic tabulations on
this basis would seem well worth the trial. It is
no more difficult than the alternative method,
and need not involve the reduction of sherds to
actual vessel-counts if this is infeasible. What

is needed, primarily, is to leave plain body
sherds out of the statistics. This brings us
to the point that archaeologists in general

feel it a matter of duty to classify and count
every single specimen in a collection. The theory
is that such studies must be complete down to
the last object in order to be accurate.

QUANTITY OF DAVIS SITE POTTERY
Returning to the Davis site, the present
analysis and percentages are based on but a

small proportion of the collection. Tables 3-14
show that 11,840 sherds were employed in the

analysis, which on careful matching are be
lieved to come from about 5,920 vessels. The

show a significant drop. Consequently, the

percentages of type representation among the

decorated vessels would greatly increase. If

(using only a speculative situation) the wholly
plain vessels constituted but 10 per cent instead
of 80 per cent of the total, the types with some
part of the vessel decorated would have to be
calculated as proportions of the remaining 90

Most of the remaining unused sherds are
likewise both plain and decorated with frag

sively from vessel bodies which could not be
connected with rims. That is to say, once the

vessel batches and miscellaneous rim sherds
were laid out and sorted as completely as seemed

possible, every effort was made to identify
body sherds in this mass of some 45,000 which
could be fitted to the known vessels. In numer

ous cases pieces were found which could be

added to the batches of polished bowls, bottles,

cylindrical vessels, etc., and to the rougher
jars. Thus, the mass of "typed pottery" was

built up about as far as the analyst found pos

sible. The opposite mass which could not be
brought into the former by association with

known rims and batches was dropped from the
study. Finally, all sherds of resident types which

In this manner about seven-eighths of the

can be called "left over." They undoubtedly

very largely belong to the same vessels as the
typed sherds, it being physically impossible to
bring them all together satisfactorily.

Now, not all the 11,840 typed sherds were

large or complete enough to decide on probable

vessel form, but it is surprising to note that
about 10,279 of them (often comprising two
or more sherds glued together) could be classi
fied by form (Tables 3-12). This determination
is a matter of argument in many cases, but after

long handling of the material I felt able to de
cide this quite often. The 10,279 pieces reduced
by careful matching to an estimated represen

tation of about 5,031 vessels, an average of

slightly over 2.0 sherds per vessel. The average
varies, however, for vessels of different form,
from 1.3 to 3.5 (Table 14).

From the average of about 2.0 sherds per

vessel within the category of typed pottery, it is

possible to estimate the total number of actual

vessels represented by the 96,000 sherds cat
aloged from the excavations. Feature 9, the
large rounded-square building north of the

primary mound, yielded the surprising number
of 4,683 sherds. Of these, 1,073 proved of use in
typing (Table 15). At the general average of 2.0
sherds per vessel, the 1,073 typed sherds repre
sent roughly 500 to 550 vessels. Thus, the 4,683

sherds give an average of about nine sherds

per vessel from within this building. The other
33 features combined yielded 2,288 sherds, of

which 415 were typed and could be reduced
rather accurately to between 200 and 220 ves

sels. The 2,288 sherds divided by 200 to 220

gives an average of 10 to 11 sherds per vessel.

Probably the average within the confines of
houses is greater than that for the widely
scattered and crushed refuse and mound fills,

but all things considered the 96,000 sherds
must come from not less than 7,000 vessels,

and 10,000 is easily possible.
This of course does not represent, and perhaps
does not even approach, the total made at the
site as a whole, for only a small fraction of the
terrace was explored. It is interesting to make
a comparison with the gross ceramic remains
and number of houses cleared in several South

western sites, as recently done by Haury and
Sayles.10 The average per dwelling shows that

increased with time, both absolutely and rela
tively to the number of inhabitants. That is,

where pottery was newly introduced it was

scarce, but as it became better established there
was "steady increase in the amount produced."
Their figures are:
Snake town, southern Arizona: 170,000 sherds from Refuse
Mound 29 alone, covering four phases of occupation but
most of it belonging to the later ones.

Anasazi ruins of Pueblo III times: Also highly productive
but perhaps not so great as Snaketown.

SU site, western New Mexico: 30,000 sherds, 18 houses
(average 1,666).
Harris village site, New Mexico: 45,000 sherds, 34 houses
(average 1,323).
Bear Ruin, Forestdale Valley, east-central Arizona: 22,000
sherds, 17 houses (average 1,294).
Mogollon village site, New Mexico: 13,000 sherds, 11 houses

(average 1,181).
Cave Creek site, southern Arizona: 2,000 sherds, 8 houses
(average 250).

Bluff site, Forestdale Valley: 2,900 sherds, 18 houses
(average 161).

The actual number of sherds found within
the confines of individual houses naturally varies
greatly. At the Bluff site, for example, one house

yielded about 42 per cent of all pottery from
houses. Feature 9 at the Davis site yielded 67

per cent of all pottery from houses. When com
pared with the above scale, it is clear that Davis
ranks among the most productive in the United
States, the 34 houses giving a gross average of
2,823 sherds per house. It is hard to say where

it ranks in the Eastern States, but I know of
none any richer.

PLOTTINGS BY DIFFERENT
CRITERIA
It has been mentioned that experimental
plottings were conducted in different ways over

a considerable period. The primary aim was

always to discover which specific combinations
of attributes would prove to have stratigraphic
significance within the site. To a certain extent,

knowledge of many other cultural units in
"Caddoan" and lower Mississippi Valley ar
chaeology suggested that certain traits would be

of earlier appearance than others. These sus

picions were tested.
In the final steps it was decided that vessel
form and technique of decoration revealed more

positive changes than any other criteria, and
being sensitive to continual alteration, would

prove to be the best guides to changing values
in the ceramics. This does not mean that other
criteria failed to show changes (see below), but

made to "slip" or "self-slip" for there seems to

be increasing doubt as to what these terms

mean. None of the present pottery shows any
definite addition to the surface that might be
called a "slip" or coating; most of it is smoothed
to well polished, and I assume that the polishing
process brought out the finest particles, giving
the surface a fine, smooth texture. As to hard
ness, the collection is uniformly about 2.0 to

2.5.

Not only did Holly clearly dominate the

earliest phase, but it was associated with the
"sand-tempered" or sandy-paste pottery in

three sub-mound houses (Table 15, Features 31,

41, 45). Since the identifiable Marksville and
Troyville sherds were found in the overlying

mound fills rather than in the sub-mound zone,
there is scant doubt that Holly Fine Engraved,
the sandy pottery, and several other types were
present together at a fairly early time.

of very fine parallel lines alternating in vertical

that any black pottery was being made at all

globular bowl idea in the Holly type, but the
number is too small for temporal orientation.
The lip of circular cross section, also found in
the Crockett type (Fig. 35, k, n,) was not noted
in Holly pottery.
A peculiar rope-like effect was produced on
the lips of two bowls by cutting deep grooves

diagonally across them at regular intervals.

One, of carinated form, has these grooves from
the outer edge of the lip over the top and down
to the rim base on the interior (Fig. 30, i). The
other, a simple bowl, has short grooves across
a widened lip with rounded upper surface (Fig.
30, k). Both are Phase 2. Three sherds from the

certain diameter was reached. A third bottle

form is represented by only seven Holly sherds

from four vessels, none of which could be il
lustrated. The sherds show a narrow ledge, one

half to one inch wide, running horizontally
around the spout base, the body presumably

being vertical below this ledge or bulging
slightly before turning in toward the base. Parts

of regular Holly design occur on the sides below
the ledge, and on the ledge itself. Two ledges

have crosshatched engraved bands around

them. Although only seven sherds were identi
fied, all are quite black and come from all phases

pieces of the same vessel sometimes were scat

tered.

Last, there is the bottle fragment shown in

Figures 31, d; 48, e. Like the above "box"

corner, this specimen demonstrates a close con
nection between Holly Fine Engraved and the
interesting grooved vessels to be discussed be
low. The bottle fragment shows a "regular"
Holly design on its upper part, unusual inas
much as all other bottles are plain above the
bulging body. The wide vertical grooves below
are deep and show faintly as ridges on the in
terior, suggesting that the grooves were cut
with a great deal of pressure in the plastic clay,
or perhaps even pressed in rather than cut. The
engraved design and grooves still bear a liberal
filling of red ocher which contrasts strikingly

with a rich chocolate background. In all, 17
pieces were found which glued into seven
sherds. One was from Feature 9, the remainder

from a single square, 23R2, on the primary
mound platform. In Table 3 all seven sherds

were erroneously entered for Feature 9; to cor
rect it would involve re-totaling this and other
tables, so the figure has been left.
Several design groupings differing from the

"regular" Holly, but which may conceivably

be variations of the type, are discussed under

Miscellaneous Engraved, below.

Looking at the Holly type as so far described,
one should experience little difficulty in recog
nizing it instantly. The bowl and bottle designs

are quite distinctive and conform to definite

norms?one for the narrow horizontal rim

zone, and another for the greater area on bulg
ing bottle bodies. Bowl-rim designs are rather
monotonously the same on hundreds of sherds,
whereas no two bottles were exactly the same
so far as can be seen?each has a different com
bination of fine parallel lines running at various
angles or set in different ways around the con
centric circles and arcs. I have noticed this in

the engraved pottery of other "Caddoan" cul
tures: stereotyped bowl designs versus individ
ualism on bottles. The Frankston Focus which
follows Alto Focus in this same region, includes
engraved bowls and bottles of very different
specific forms and motifs, but reveals the same
tendency toward expending individualism on
the bottles rather than bowls. A fuller picture

of these tendencies in many related cultural

units is in preparation.
The "special" vessels just discussed represent
interesting individual deviations from the bowl
and bottle forms, but they are extremely few in

number. Likewise, there is extremely little hy
bridization of the Holly type with others at the
site, quite notably less than in the case of the
Crockett and Pennington or Dunkin and Weches

types. It would be of great interest to know
whether the impressive black Holly pottery
was a special mortuary ware. This might ac

count for its more conservative characteristics
when compared with other resident types, but
it awaits the discovery of graves here.2

HICKORY FINE ENGRAVED
This type is easily distinguished from Holly
Fine Engraved by its extremely simple designs.

Primarily these consist of horizontal lines

around bowl rims and bottle shoulders. Grids
of crossed diagonal lines also occur on a number
of bowls. The lines are usually as fine as those

on Holly vessels, sometimes almost invisible
where the surface is weathered, and also com
monly contain powdered red ocher.
A total of 528 sherds from an estimated 227
vessels were identified and plotted (Table 4).
Of the type total, 13.3% came from Phase 1,

surpassed only by Holly and Davis Incised
(Table 13, line 12). In the phase total, however,

it constituted only 5.9%, being surpassed by
several types and descriptive groups (Table

13, line 13). It might be thought of as only a
series of simplified Holly designs, but similar
if not identical pottery occurs in the Haley and
Spiro foci far to the north, whereas the Holly
type does not, so far as known. A higher per
cent of it came from the mound (55) than in
the case of Holly (44).

Compared with Holly Fine Engraved, the

relative popularity of carinated bowls and bot
tles was almost reversed: 61.6% of the sherds

identified by form are from bottles {Holly,
24.5%), and 30.6% are from carinated bowls
{Holly, 67.7%). Simple or deep bowls consti
tute 7.6% {Holly, 4.5%). No other forms were

noted from the excavations, but a single dark

2 The Gahagan site in northwestern Louisiana has
yielded several perfect examples of black Holly Fine En
graved vessels, all of which may have been obtained by
trade from the Davis site itself, so close is their identity.

Since the Gahagan multiple burials contained very few
vessels but were rich in non-ceramic offerings, it is in
dicated that the black engraved vessels were highly prized,
if not specifically manufactured or bought for mortuary

purposes. See Moore, 1912, Figs. 22, 23; Webb and Dodd,
1939, PI. 26:3, Figs. 1, 2. Several other points of connection
with Gahagan are mentioned on pages 197-9.

very rare here and perhaps a specialization of

cave side and shallow, convex bottom (Figs.

these; the illustrations showing sherd photo

the cylindrical form occurs in both. The cari

punctates (Figs. 38, p-t; 39, d, h; 40, d), and

going but with straight, slightly flaring side
and a circular lip (Fig. 39, h) was the only one
of its kind in the collection and the only such

seen in the Crockett type. Conversely, the globu

not noted in Pennington. There were no bottles
in either.
Pennington designs are basically simple, con
sisting of triangles, diamonds, spaced slanting
bands, or angular bands with punctates. As in
Crockett Curvilinear Incised, it is difficult to find

sidered normal variations of both types. There

is nothing so distinctive about the banded
designs at Davis that they would stand out as
trade pieces, yet this is not impossible. They
are entered separately in Table 7. Out of 30
sherds from 24 vessels (probably all bowls),
only one was from Phase 1 (Feature 31). The
banded designs were therefore largely a later
trait than the Pennington triangles and di
amonds. If trade pottery, their position agrees
(29 cases out of 30) with that of Marksville
and/or Troyville trade pieces in Phases 2 and

3 (Table 12). The band designs further in

with a rounded implement, at others with a
sharply squared implement pressed into the
clay at an angle. When sharply triangular
punctates were made close together in rows
across a band, the effect was sometimes like
that of a heavy dentate stamp (Fig. 34, p).

This vessel was unusual for Pennington in being
a small cylindrical cup, rich chocolate in color,

and well polished although the surface has

flaked away on most of its pieces; the number
of angular turns in the bands is unknown.

Most Pennington vessels agree well with

Crockett in colors ranging through browns and
reddish brown. They have less surface polish,

the plain areas often being merely smoothed
rather than polished. The paste, like that of
Crockett is rather coarse and liberally tem
pered with clay grit and carbon. Bone temper
appears occasionally in Phase 2 and after.

Peaked rims appear on but one definite

Pennington vessel represented by six scattered

sherds, one in Zone 2, Phase 1. Notched lips

were noted on two vessels, their sherds coming
from the field. On the other hand, flat, wide lips

were more common than in any type except
Holly. There are 34 such sherds from 13 cari
nated bowls out of 134, a proportion of 9.7%.
An additional 18 rim sherds from 16 bowls, pre

cise shape unknown, have this lip (Table 7).
No examples appeared in Phase 1, hence we

vex on bowls but more deeply so on the cari

nated form than the small high-sided ones. Six
corner sherds from flat, square bases (Fig. 39,

k) presumably belonged to cylindrical vessels
(see Dunkin Incised Fig. 41, c, h for form).

FREE PUNCTATES
Punctates very similar to those in the types
just discussed were also found "free"?that is,
unbounded by geometrical figures. These are
evidently common in Rhinehardt Punctated of
Louisiana but are not relegated to any particu
lar type here since they may be variations of
Pennington, Rhinehardt, or some other type.
The free punctates included in Rhinehardt
Punctated are usually triangular, occasionally
ring-shaped, while semilunar or crescentic
"have been observed."8 The latter are men
tioned as though they were variations of the
round (ring) punctates?i.e., partial rings. In
the present case, the "semilunar" or crescentic
punctates are definitely not variations of Pen
nington (or Rhinehardt}) ring-punctates but be
long to a distinct type, Weches Fingernail Im

The plain, triangular, and ring "free"

punctates have been added to Table 7 below
the Pennington type, but are tabulated sepa

rately. My feeling is that these sherds are most

closely related to Pennington in color, paste,
surface finish, etc., but unlike the latter the

I will repeat, however, that aside from design
there is nothing in their paste, color, shape, or

finish to set them off as foreign to the site. They

nicely illustrate the delicate problem of formu

submerge cultural undercurrents of greater im
portance than our classificatory exercises.
Most of these sherds are of rich dark brown

Creek Brushed." Polished vessels with widely

spaced lines running only horizontally were then

all placed with Davis Incised (Fig. 45), and

still are.9

In the final tabulations (Table 8), all these

varieties were included in Dunkin Incised. The
different vessel forms and design arrangements
have, however, all been entered separately, so

even Holly Fine Engraved with a total of 3,092
(Fig. 40, m).

There are no special lip treatments, but the
jars show an unusual frequency of rim peaks,
probably two or four in number. The sherds of

15 of the 34 jars?nearly half?bear signs of

such peaks. Bases are wholly unknown except

that the cylindrical specimen in Figure 40, j

had a bumpy but flat base.

9 In Krieger (1946, Fig. 19) the names uHardy Incised"
and llDunkin Diagonal Incised" were both used, and may
indeed still be separate types. They are here placed to

gether as Dunkin Incised. The name Hardy Incised is
that used by Quimby (1942, PL XV: 8-12, p. 267) for
a clay-tempered type "found in both the Plaquemine and

Natchezan cultures." He confines it to crudely incised
horizontal, parallel lines in a band around the vessel, but it
was a mistake for me to use it for Davis pottery without

If type distinctions were to be made here or
in the Davis material* it would probably have
to be done on the basis of shape, placing cylin

punctated, or incised with vertical lines. Most

between tall cylindrical vessels, unpolished or

lines, often very tastefully arranged in alter

bowls (Fig. 63, h), red-filmed bowls (Fig. 65, e,
i, k) and so on, all with the same simple hori

sel from the site, reconstruction based on sherds

Only 22 cylindrical vessels had the simple drical and barrel-shaped vessels into one

Some must have been quite large, up to 18

inches high and 13 linches across (Figs. 41, a;

conflict with the type Davis Incised. I should

therefore prefer to wait for stratigraphic evi

before subdividing Dunkin Incised.
One further point must be made about this
pressed and Duren Neck Banded, but in each
type, namely, the reason for including what
case they came from Phase 2 and 3 locations,

not from Phase 1. This suggests a new trait used to be called uBox Creek Brushed" and

uBox Creek Cross-Brushed" (Newell). On first

form a separate "type," but its effect is merely

to imitate the diagonal grids so common in

single, double, or bunched lines diagonally

may indeed be viewed as merely an alternative

Krieger (1946, pp. 237-41, 268, and Pis. 33-35). At that
time I wrote that a derivation of neck banding in the
Fulton Aspect from early Pueblo IV cultures in the South
west was more likely than an earlier connection, but also
pointed out a peculiar resemblance to Alma Neck Banded
. in the considerably earlier Mogollon culture, both in vessel

form and in the confinement of neck banding (and crude
corrugation of neck coils) to the vessel rims. This was be
fore the Davis site material had been fully plotted, but it
was stated that the problem was still an open one. It now

appears that Duren Neck Banded could well have existed
at a time comparable to Mogollon, but it must also be

stressed that no other traits at the Davis site support the
possibility of contact with the Southwest at this time. That

neck banding is also known in Honduras and Venezuela
may or may not be pertinent. It is, of course, possible that
the Duren type was a purely local invention. The chrono

sherds in primary-mound fills and the 25 in
secondary-mound fills can all be adduced to

carrying upward with mound clay. This pottery

was probably no longer made (or acquired) by
the time the primary mound was being built.

In terms of the total pottery from each
phase, the sandy ware constituted 9.7% of
Phase 1, 5.6% of Phase 2, 0.9% of Phase 3.
If adjusted to the sub-mound position of 84
"Phase 2" sherds, it would have amounted to
22.3% of Phase 1 (surpassed only by Holly

Fine Engraved, 32.8%), and only 1.0% of Phase

2, Phase 3 remaining the same. These calcula
tions are based partly on sherd batches; if all

sherds could be reduced to actual vessels and
accurately located, the truth would be some

where between these alternative percentages.
Only a few vessels could be reconstructed for

size and shape, and these only incompletely.

The most definite is shown in Figure 49, a-a".
Sixty-five sherds are believed to belong to this
vessel. Some glued sections reach from the lip
to a shallow angle where the wall turns toward
the base; the latter was probably conical, the
central point being present in a sherd shaped

smooth, but now crumbles. Most of this vessel

was under Fills 7 and 8, other sherds under
Fills 4, 5, and 9; five sherds in the secondary

mound show how parts of vessels broken
earlier were transported upward (Table 12,
Incised Vessel A).

Another vessel was very much like the first
in form, color (dark greenish gray), and decora

tion (Fig. 49, b). The diagonal incisions were

evidently more regularly spaced and the upper
areas between them punctated. The wall turns
very slightly below the design. There was no
border of square punctates. Its sherds (21) were
scattered much like those of vessel A.
Five sherds from the rims of three other ves
sels have incised designs. One (Fig. 49, c) has a
simple grid of cross lines, one set at a slight
angle to the lip. Two are small but show parts

of concentric squares comparable to certain
Marksville Incised sherds mentioned below.
Two others have parts of straight and curvilin

ear elements, but the design cannot be made

out.

Three sherds from two vessels have finely
engraved rim lines crossing in a grid almost
exactly like that of the incised specimen in

Figure 49, c. The only difference is in the oppo

site pitch of one set of lines (Fig. 49, d, e).
One engraved sherd is from the sub-mound
village in Square 14L5. The two from a second

vessel are from Feature 31, sub-mound, and
the field. As Feature 31 was under the first
point of mound construction and we know a
great deal of engraved pottery was already

being made, it is interesting to have the latter

technique used to decorate the early sandy
pottery.
The remaining sherds are plain. On the as

the wall of nearby Feature 31. All but the

latter have been tabulated as from Feature 45.

None were in mound fills or away from the
mound. With this number of pieces it is rather
sure that the original vessel was directly asso

The lines may form either curvilinear or recti

squares. Conventionalized bird figures are

fairly common. The decoration usually covers
the entire body; it may continue to the lip or

the rim (which may be cambered) and may
be crosshatched with a row of hemiconical
punctates below, as in Marksville Stamped.

Characteristics of paste, temper, color, form,

that is, they may not have come from the classic

Marksville or Hopewell centers, but from out

inferior or imitative; indeed, some could have

The design patterns do stand out strongly

made here or imported, these sherds represent

culture. Moreover, they proved to occupy a

definite position in the site, agreeing with the
more definite stamped sherds.

variable angles), and (3) curvilinear meanders.

SUMMARY
This section bears the heading "Presumed

Trade and Aberrant Pottery." It can be divided
into four parts: (1) sandy pottery either made
here or imported, (2) identifiable trade pieces,
(3) "imitations" on local pottery of extraneous
techniques, (4) minor elements not definitely

traceable to known outside stimuli (i.e., the
appendages and painted sherds), but which
may provide historical clues when the vessel
forms are known. The first three parts are listed

on Table 12, the fourth at the bottom of Table

17.

The material in Phase 1 locations shows

quite significant differences from that in Phases
2 and 3. The sandy pottery, represented by 278

sherds from about 42 vessels, was seen to be
long almost entirely to the sub-mound village,

pieces higher up being few and probably all
carried upward during mound construction.

This is the only type or descriptive group from
the site to be made (or obtained) exclusively be
fore mound construction began. Yet it was as
sociated with black Holly Fine Engraved, Hick

ory Engraved and several incised types in

Feature 9 itself contained examples of Marks

four-armed figure, none of which appeared in
any Phase 1 (sub-mound) house. Yet Feature 9

also contained numerous examples of every

even two of the sandy sherds (Table 15). Since
everything in the site points to the continuous

make this trade distinction when paste, temper,
color, finish, form, etc., are so much the same
in the general clay-tempered pottery horizon
of the lower Mississippi Valley region.
The "imitative" factor itself, if the present

evaluation is true, is of considerable cultural

interest. The term "influence" might be used,
connoting a fusing of local and extraneous ele
ments, but I am very suspicious of it when time
factors and specific directions are highly tenta

tive. For example, a "Coles Creek influence"
has often been mentioned to "account for"
horizontal incised lines on all kinds of pottery.

Coles Creek can be said to share this feature

with other ceramic complexes, but it will be a
long time before anyone knows just where the
idea started, the directions in which it spread,
and the specific adaptations made locally.

and will be but briefly described. Figures 53

Tables 17-18 show the stratigraphic position
of all stone artifacts and pigments found. Ordi

hammerstones, hones, knives, scrapers, and
gravers were but sparsely represented in the
mound, as might be expected. But since the
mound provides our only sure stratigraphic

control, the general dearth of utilitarian arti
facts in it renders their occurrence in the three

phases of occupation uncertain. That is, ab

flat surface being put to use without modifica
tion. Symmetry was not sought and the blocks

are either angular, probably taken from out
crops, or somewhat oval, probably so worn in

stream beds. They are universally small and

easy to carry, only 8 to 10 inches across at the
most, 1 to 3 inches thick, and weighing up to

15 or 20 pounds. The material is so hard it

seldom shows any wear. As it sometimes occurs
in very large concretions, the slabs often have
a slightly concave natural surface which became
the basin; or again, a flat surface was used but
the motion was always rotary.

Milling stones from the Davis site are en

1 The author prefers "milling stone" as a general designa
tion for slabs on which rotary motion was used. A previous

suggestion of "seed slab" (Krieger, 19456, p. 51) is hereby
rescinded. "Metate" is reserved for, and limited to, stones
on which back-and-forth motion was used in the Puebloan
and Middle American manner. The latter implement was
diffused eastward into Texas about as far as Fort Worth

(Krieger, 1946, pp. 79, 108-9, 126, 138) but is entirely
unknown in the "Caddoan" area. If the same distinction
were made elsewhere, most so-called "metates" in North
America outside of Middle America and the Southwest
would belong to the "milling stone" category.

Twenty-five specimens of ferruginous sand

can be called manos; nearly all of these have a
shallow pecked-out circular pit in the grinding

quite unsuitable, and one is pure hematite. Two

Twenty-three stream pebbles of convenient

faces. The hematite specimen bears a good

polish over both faces and the pits; it would seem
quite useless as a mano (too smooth) or a "nut
stone" (too fragile).2
Forty-two nut stones, each with one or more
pits in one or both faces, were recovered (Fig.

from stream action, but not on plane surfaces
as is the case with manos. These are all fer

easily carried in one hand. Small examples are
about 2X2X1 inch, large ones 4X6X2 inches.
Whether from outcrops, concretions, or stream
beds, pieces of this material already presented
at least one fairly level face and had only to be

provided with pits in which to lay the nuts
(acorns, walnuts, hickory nuts, etc.) to be
cracked.
A detailed tabulation should perhaps be made
of the various combinations of grinding faces
and pits, but it could hardly reveal anything
beyond the indiscriminate use of the same con

cracking platforms.

The battering is the only evidence of modifica

other pebbles and fragments. All are quartzite,

a singularly tough material and widely used

over North America for crushing food, pigments,

etc.

Two oblong pebbles of brown ferruginous
sandstone bear shallow encircling grooves at

right angles to the long axis (Fig. 54, j). They
may be regarded as hammerstones grooved for
hafting or as club heads. The material, unlike

quartzite, could be easily ground or pecked
into shape.

"Arrow" Points
Alba Barbed. This is the only resident type in

the arrow category. The blade edges are com
monly recurved or concave between the widely
flaring barbs and the tip; they are sometimes

finely serrated. Stems vary from parallel-edged

to bulbous and fan shape. Length varies from
\ to If inch but 1 inch is most common; the

stem is usually J to J the total length (Fig. 56,
a-h). About 10 per cent are petrified wood, the
remainder flint in a wide range of color: cream,
buff, tan, gray, and reddish brown. The type
occurred in every phase, but only six of the 174

specimens are certainly from Phase 1 (Table
18). This is enough to prove, however, that

Alba Barbed points (and, by inference, the bow
and arrow) were first in use here before the
mound was erected. In fact, the occurrence of

these small points in Features 30, 31, and 45
(Table 16) shows the type present beneath the

initial four "small mounds." This also means
they were adopted before "dart" points and

sandy pottery were abandoned.

teresting coincidence. It now appears much more likely
that they could be historically related. These represent, I

believe, the first appearance of "arrow" (as opposed to
"dart") points in the Valley of Mexico, dating roughly 500
A.D., and can be said to differ from Hayes Barbed only in
the material: obsidian (see Linne, 1935, Figs. 301, 302, 308,
310, and p. 148). The four examples shown by Linne do not

come as close to typical Hayes Barbed specimens from
Arkansas as do several others on display at Teotihuacan.
Before drawing any conclusions it would be necessary to
know where this style is found, spatially and chronologi
cally, elsewhere in Mexico?if anywhere. On this there is
nothing in the literature.

Clear Fork Foci, Edwards Plateau Aspect. At the Round

Mountain site, two Wells specimens were found deep within
the 40-foot terrace at actual depths of 230 and 124 inches,

near the beginning of deposition of the terrace. This is
thought to have begun at circa 4000 or 2000 B.C. and to
have extended to about 1000 A.D. In my opinion, these
early specimens are somewhat aberrant typologically, al
though they do apparently fall with the range of variation
of Wells Contracting Stem. In the Sandy Creek, Grelle I,
and Grelle II sites the type seems to have ranged from the
upper part of the 40-foot terrace {circa 1000 A.D. minus

X) to just prior to the Austin and Toyah Foci (ceramic
cultures beginning circa 1500 A.D.)."
Typologically, the four specimens from the Grelle I and

II sites are certainly closer to the long-stemmed Davis
examples, the chief difference being a lack of smoothed
stem edges. The two deep Round Mountain specimens have
shorter stems and wider shoulders, hence may resemble
Wells points only superficially.

Yarbrough Stemmed. This is a common type
in late pre-pottery sites in northeast Texas, but
its continuation into pottery association is not

yet well known. Seven points are considered

to belong to this type, but all are rather crudely
made: one white flint, two petrified wood, and

four dull chert (Fig. 57, w-aa). They were

from under Zone 7, the primary mound fill, and

could be from Phase 1 or 2. Three are from

Zones 14 and 15 in the field, and two from the

plow zone.
A most interesting feature is that all eight
specimens are local flints. These are cream,
ivory, flesh-colored, and gray with white flecks.

Although their precise source is unknown, they
are the same flints noted for the Morrill, Wells,
and some Gary points, and many of the chipped

Summary
The projectile points reveal four matters of
considerable historical interest:
1. An unmistakable shift from dart to arrow
points during the three mound phases can be
seen in Table 18. The resident arrow-point type,
Alba Barbed, was present in the sub-mound vil

abruptly in Phase 3 with only six (8.2 percent).

The triangular Taylor and Baird points do

not provide a specific connection with any par
ticular part of central Texas, since they occur
from the Clear Fork Focus in the upper Brazos

River valley southward into Tamaulipas and
the Texas coast. However, Kelley has shown
the Bulverde type to be much more localized in
the Colorado River basin above Austin, and we

may perhaps assume that the Davis people
learned to make all three types from peoples of
the Round Rock Focus near Austin. Specimens

of Wells Contracting Stem have, conversely,
been found in Kelley's excavations in this area,
among other localities in central Texas. None of
these types is known anywhere east of the Davis

site.

4. The correlated archaeological and geolog

ical (terrace) datings reached by Kelley in the

central Texas excavations provide a tentative

cross-dating for Phases 1 and 2 at Davis

through these projectile points. This is from ap

proximately 1000 A.D. minus X (X being the
time needed for the formation of the upper parts

of the 40-foot terrace) until 1500 A.D., when
pottery appears in this region. When pottery
does appear in central Texas, it is not of Alto
Focus types, but a peculiar plain ware in which
intrusives occur from the later Frankston
Focus.31 The original appearance of central
Texas dart point styles at the Davis site cannot
be dated accurately. A time between 500 and
1000 A.D., if not earlier, seems quite reasonable,
considering the various lines of evidence treated
here: Kelley's geological correlations, the sand
tempered pottery associated with Phase 1, the

rocker-stamped sherds appearing in Phase 2,
the close comparisons with Formative Period

ceramics in Middle America, the great similar

there is no reason to doubt that the same ob
ject was used for different purposes?for cut
ting, scraping, hacking, etc., as occasion arose.

The following groupings are based primarily on
size and symmetry, and probably conform to
the dominating functions of the artifacts.

"Copena" knives. There is some possibility

that these are spear or lance points. They are
characterized by recurved edges?i.e., the base

and midpoint are about the same width, but
between these points the blade narrows (Fig.
60, a-h). Twenty-four were found, three from
each of Phases 1 and 2, one from Phase 3, and

17 from the field, of which 13 were in Zones 14
and 15. The large specimen in Figure 60, a was
found in a posthole (Fig. 25, g) associated with
Features 10-18, the group of houses north of

the mound (Fig. 13). We may suppose these
"knives" to have been a well established trait

during Phases 1 and 2, probably not continuing
into Phase 3. The specimens are all apparently
of local flint, cream, ivory, tan, light gray, some

with pinkish tinges and others with abundant
white flecks. This easily identified type provides
a very definite connection with cultures to the
east and across the Mississippi.32 On the other
32 Webb and Dejarnette (1942, pp. 301-6) called similar
specimens "Copena points" because of association with the

Copena Focus. Two village and five mound sites of this
focus were recognized by them in the Pickwick Basin of

the Tennessee River. Only two had these "points" or

knives in any quantity: site HN?4, 15 specimens (PI. 29);

and site LUV65, 10 specimens (PL 207). Four sites had

only one or two examples apiece. Three sites, including
LUV65, yielded one fluted ("Folsom") point apiece (Pis.
132, 207), which is interesting in view of the fluted point
fragment from Davis (present Fig. 57, v and pp. 170-2). The

Copena Focus is included in a "Southern Aspect of the
Hopewellian Phase" by Webb and Dejarnette. Martin,
Quimby, and Collier (1947, pp. 351-3) conjecture that
"The Copena Indians were closely related to Hopewell,
Troy ville, and late Adena peoples." Lewis and Kneberg
(1947, PL 2) illustrate similar blades from a preceramic
Archaic culture in western Tennessee. There are Copena
knives in the Spiro mound collections at Norman, Okla
homa. Harrington (1920, Pis. CX, CXI) shows them from
the Mineral Springs site in southwest Arkansas, probably
a Spiro Focus component. Copena knives were also found

and laid roughly in layers. Figure 61, a-m shows
13 examples of 57 blades considered to be axes,

each having a sharp-edged base. The bodies
vary in outline from triangular to parallel

edged and leaf-shaped (broadest in the middle).
The remaining five blades in the cache are con
sidered to be heavy side scrapers rather than
axes; they are chipped along the edges on one

side only, are roughly oval, and have no dis
tinct bases (Fig. 61, n-p). It is quite possible

that some of the cached blades are neither axes
nor scrapers, but roughly blocked-out objects
stored away with the intention of doing more
refined chipping when needed.
The cache, however, was not associated with
any buildings, graves, or other features, so far
as known. The flint is quite the same as we have
mentioned repeatedly in connection with dart
points, knives, and scrapers. The colors range
through cream, ivory, light gray, tan, flesh
colored, light yellowish-brown, etc.; three have
gray bands, and one has reddish bands (Fig. 61,
d, j); others (especially the grays) have numer
ous white flecks and crystals. The caching of
large blades in this manner is, I believe, com

base that could serve as axe bit. Specimens selected to show variations in form and size; triangular; long, parallel

and flesh-colored with numerous tiny white flecks and crystals, and sometimes red and white veins. Black'spots

are moss stains. The source of this flint was probably nearby for it is a common material at the site.

The pottery that could be identified by type or

sherds which could not be used for typological

pottery types were represented in houses, but

in varying numbers. "Sand-tempered" or

sandy-paste pottery was present in three (Fea

contained any "presumed trade sherds."
The four houses on the primary-mound plat

were square with oblique corners and aligned

the primary-mound platform was complete or
nearly so, at the end of Phase 2 (Fig. 4 and see

field east of the mound and could not be tied

into the three mound phases; they include
houses similar in structure to those of both

Phase 1 and 2 in the mound.

Assuming that 23 houses belonged to the
original sub-mound village (Features 10-18,

including 15 A, 19, 29 to 33, 37, 38, and 41 to
45), we find that they were all round except for

the oval Feature 37; none had an extended

entranceway, entrance being through any of
several wall gaps; five had sub-floor cache pits,
two to nine in number, plus nine pits in the ten
over-lapping outlines of Features 10-18 (Table

Barbed arrow points in four sub-mound houses,

dart points in two of these (Features 31, 33), is
important. Seven sub-mound houses, including
these same ones, had Holly Fine Engraved sherds
on their floors, and three of those with Holly

also had sandy-paste sherds. All these cross
ties help to cement the fact that these important

traits were present together in Phase 1 before
mound construction began.

corn, wood, and cane; animal bones and mussel
shells; burned clay (from walls or roofs); and a

convenience for discussing what happened. At
no time was there any pronounced change, it
being quite evident that the three phases apply
to a single cultural continuum undergoing sub

innovations arising within the resident group,
including the transfer of attributes from one

about their nature, function, or relative popu

traits by outside contacts, including the imita

rather definite traits that can be listed in the
conventional manner. Pottery, however, can be
broken down into an infinite number of "traits"

groups; less common in Davis Incised; a few in
Hickory, Dunkin, and Bowles Creek Plain.*
Bottles common in Holly, Hickory types; a few in
groups with engraved scrolls and "stepped" de
signs; three sherds Davis Incised; possibly repre

but not definite enough to tabulate.4
Simple bowls most common in Davis type, less so in

Holly; a few sherds in Hickory, "stepped" and
"zigzag" engraved groups, and Crockett.*

Cylindrical and barrel-shaped vessels common in
Dunkin type; much less so in grooved vessels and
Davis and Weches types; few sherds in Holly and
Pennington types.4
Jars common in Dunkin and Weches types; Duren
Neck Banded much more common than in Phase
1 and consists entirely of jars, many of them large

storage (?) vessels; also a few polished jar sherds
in Holly type among vessels with free punctates
(Table 7) and those with grooved designs.4
Compound bowls very rare; only definite sherd is
from an undecorated vessel.4
Bowls have evenly convex bottoms.4
Bottles, cylindrical and barrel-shaped vessels, and
jars have flat disk bases.4

simple and carinated bowls in Davis types; a

few Crockett and Pennington bowls; jars in the
Weches type and free-punctated group.4
Prevalence in Phase 1 of black and chocolate brown
colors in Holly type and minor engraved groups
was probably being lost in Phase 2, although nu

merous examples were found; probably more
medium browns and reddish browns than previ
ously in polished as well as unpolished vessels.4

Greatly widened, flat, decorated lips continue in

Holly type on carinated bowls; also appear on
simple deep bowls and in other types (see below).4

4. Minor descriptive groups and specific attributes first
appearing in this phase; not proved present in Phase 1.

All new accretions together constitute only a small frac

Side scrapers, retouched spalls (3).4
"Pick," pointed flint chipped on both sides (l).4

G. Earthworks: This phase consists of several stages of
mound building, beginning with a long and narrow
platform mound (Zone 6) erected over one of the four
small rounded mounds (Zone 2) of the previous stage.

A small extension and wide low bench on the south
side could have faced a small "plaza" or ceremonial
area on that side (Fig. 27, b). Subsequently, the plat
form area was greatly increased laterally by adding
fills of clay (Zone 7) to the north, east, and south

slopes, the excavations not being conducted far

enough to discover what happened on the western end.

Features 9 and 35 may have been erected when Zone

7 was complete (or after), their entrance passages
pointing toward the platform. Zones 8 and 9 were
added, further increasing the platform area north and

east, but not south. Features 34, 36, 39, and 40 were
erected upon this platform. The completed platform

now covered all four of the small rounded mounds.

During all this lateral expansion, the platform
height was not increased appreciably (probably from
about 9 feet with Zone 6 to 10 feet with Zone 9). The
fills all contained great numbers of potsherds, and oc
casionally parts of vessels which could be fitted to
parts from under the fills; this situation, with the lack

of any visible borrow pit, shows that the practice of

gathering clay from the occupied area around the

mound was continued from the end of Phase 1.

H. Evidence of trade (see Tables 12,17,18):
Sand-tempered or sandy-paste pottery, 5.6 per cent

of phase total, nearly all under rather than in
mound fills (local or trade?) .4

Marksville Incised (?), concentric squares (5);
crossed diagonals (l).4
Marksville Incised, S-shaped meanders on body,
square base, conical leg (mound and Feature 9).

field).

Sherds with four-armed voluted figures (1 from
Feature 9, 1 from field).
Catahoula sandstone and concretionary nodules ob

tained from outcrops of Catahoula Formation

about 50 miles downstream.

White and gray kaolin obtained from vicinity of
Troup, Texas; used for small carved head and pig
ments in pottery decoration.

Black slate and black micaceous sandstone, used

for flat adzes, probably obtained in central Ar
kansas mineral region.
Green and gray-green sandstone, schist, porphyry
for celts, or celts themselves imported, probably
from Arkansas region.

Gray-green talc schist (rim sherd of stone bowl)
probably obtained in central Arkansas or the
Appalachian Mountains.

4. Specific attributes of resident pottery types:
Continued tendency toward lighter colors, thicker

walls, coarser temper and paste, poorer surface
finish, less careful design execution; in utility and

polished types alike.6
Design motifs as before, with addition of excised
negative meanders on bowl rims (Fig. 37, f).6
Flat bases on jars, bottles; round bottoms on bowls

continued.6

Vessel forms as before except that cylindrical and
barrel-shaped vessels decrease in number while
jars with everted rims increase.6
Four raised rim peaks on bowls, jars, continued.6
Bone temper continued, not over 5 per cent of any

one type.6
Engraved imitations (?) of Marksville Incised de
signs continued (7).6
Legs (?), conical, and bar-shaped legs or flange (?)
fragments continue, but always very scarce.6

Wide, flat, decorated lips and flanged lips (partic
ularly in Holly and Pennington types) decrease or

disappear.6

Thick circular and cambered lips on globular bowls
(especially in Crockett type) disappear.6

Square bases disappear.6
Miniature vessels (almost all Bowles Creek Plain)
increased considerably, if present at all previously.

Black paint dribbles first appear (3 in secondary
mound, 5 in field at shallow depths).
D. Other clay artifacts:
Ear spools, ring-shaped (l).6
Pipes, long-stemmed (5).6
Figurine part, animal (l).6
E. Miscellaneous stone artifacts, pigments:

Milling stones, manos, pitted nutstones, probably
continued.6
Hammerstones probably continued.6
Use of Catahoula sandstone for hones and possibly
other artifacts.6

Hematite, limonite pigments (3).6

"Adze" blade (l).6

Celts, petaloid, "green stone" (13 fragments).6

Kaolin pigments (6).6
Quartz crystals (1 from Zone 10, 8 from field at
shallow depths).
Pulley-shaped ear spool fragments (6 from Zones 10
and 11, 3 from field at shallow depths).

"Tablet" fragments, including beveled (none on
mound but 8 from field at shallow depths).

F. Chipped stone artifacts:
Alba Barbed arrow points (13).6
Dart points include Gary Stemmed (3), Wells Con
tracting Stem (1), Yarbrough Stemmed (2), but all
dart types probably passed out of use in Phase 2.6

"Copena" knife (l).6
Leaf-shaped knives (2).6
Axe (?) blade (l).6

Awls, small, with unshaped bases (2, plus 6 from

field).

G. Earthworks: The secondary mound was built com
pletely over the primary-mound platform, covering it
to a depth of 7 feet or more, and extending thinly over
the primary-mound slopes. The modern top was gen
erally level around the two mound legs (Fig. 3, a-d),
but much narrower than the underlying platform; it
had probably been narrowed somewhat by later wash
ing, but could not have been as wide as the platform.
For some reason not clear, the secondary mound was

much more homogeneous than the primary mound,
generally lacking the basket-load construction of the
latter, although this was evident in places. It was not,
however, a midden accumulation, and must have been
erected rapidly as a unit. It contained large amounts
of sherds and other artifacts, considerably more than
the primary mound, and must also have been built of
clay scooped up in the surrounding village area rather
than from a borrow pit.

H. Evidence of trade:
Obtaining of materials such as Catahoula sandstone,

kaolin, and "greenstone" celts probably con
tinued from Phase 2.6

Marksville Incised (?) sherds, concentric squares

(7)-6.

Chevalier Stamped (?), vertical rocker zones (1).

Haley Focus (?) sherds (1, plus 2 in field).
Sanders Engraved sherds (1, plus 5 in field).
Red-filmed sherds (4, plus 23 in field, 1 in Feature 9).

Hayes Barbed arrow points, from Haley Focus (3,
plus 3 in field).
Possibly some blue-gray flint from central Texas.

SURFACE OCCUPATION BY

LATER GROUP

A number of potsherds and other artifacts
were found only on the modern surface and in
the plow zone (top 10 inches) of the field around

the mound. These can be attributed to the
Frankston Focus, a late prehistoric culture in
the Neches River Valley representing the an
cestors of the Hasinai Caddo division.7 Their oc
cupation must have been very brief and prob

7 A brief account of the Frankston Focus, its connection

with Hasinai tribes, and indicated dates, will be found in
Krieger (1946, pp. 206-12). In this work, the Frankston
Focus was said to extend into a European contact period
after circa 1600 A.D. Since then, an Allen Focus has been
defined for the contact period, Frankston Focus now being
entirely pre-contact {circa 1400-1600 A.D.). Frankston has
the same pottery types and other artifacts as before except
that Patton Engraved belongs entirely to the new, historic

Allen Focus (see Fig. 18 in the 1946 work). Frankston was
doubtlessly the immediate ancestor of the Allen Focus, and
therefore of the historic Hasinai Caddo tribes. Not a single
artifact of the Allen Focus was found here.

common traits of the Frankston rather than
the Alto Focus. Their plotted positions, how
ever, do not permit a statement on whether
these objects belonged to one occupation or the

of engraving and incising pottery, as well as neck-banding

they can hardly be confused. The cultural evolution from

region, but farther east, probably in the Red River Valley

system, so that a subsequent westward spread of "Cad

late foci in eastern Texas.

AFFILIATIONS of the alto focus
abbreviated. discussions
The check-list method
of
THE following
are necessarily
showing trait presence or absence in other sites
or cultures, while generally used to show "re
lationships," will not be followed here. For one
things these lists are almost always incomplete,

the traits being followed only so far as the

analyst has the time or the interest to follow
them. For another, they are only inventories,
with little if anything to do with culture proc
esses such as selecting, development, and rela
tive popularity; it is not the number of traits
held in common by cultural entities, but the
kind of traits, the way they cluster (or fail to)
in the process of borrowing, and the use made

of them that should occupy our attention.

Third, a check-list made without thorough con
sideration of time factors is apt to throw to
gether a miscellany of traits that show neither
a direct relationship nor the direction of bor
rowing. Fourth, the mere number of traits in

common between two groups is meaningless

unless broken down into the more general or

widely shared practices, and those special or
specific traits which actually demonstrate a re
lationship between those two groups, and those
alone. Thus, trait lists may be convenient for

quick visualization of a given situation, but

they are not studies in relationships.
To follow out trait comparisons fully for the
Davis site would require a volume. No pretense
is made here of a full exploration of its possi
bilities. Rather, I wish only to indicate the lines
along which the Alto Focus material seems to
bear its closest relationships. There is too much
involved for a completely satisfactory correla
tion, much less a "taxonomic" classification in

terms of "patterns" and "phases."

No chart will be presented here for the cor
relation of cultures in Middle America and the
Eastern United States. The Davis site certainly
changes our previous concepts, but so far as our
understanding goes of what actually happened
between these major regions and when, I think
we are barely getting started. Too many charts
and confident statements have been published,

purporting to "correlate" culture horizons in
the Eastern States and Middle America, but

in no case do they involve any real research on

both sides of the problem; it is "felt" that the
cultures ought somehow to line up in the charts
so they are entered in what seem likely posi
tions.1

We will not try to make a complete survey

of artifacts and building traits comparable to
those at the Davis site. Instead, the discussion

will be confined to those particular lines of

evidence which seem most likely to explain the
origins of the Alto Focus as a whole, and its ap
proximate date. Considerable attention will be
devoted to the pottery, for this was generally
more subject to subtle changes, yielding special
characteristics relatively easy to identify and

to delimit in time and space. The analyst,

working intensively with a given run of mater

ial, is entitled to concentrate on those clues

which seem most fruitful to him, to the neglect
of those thought to be more remote from the

immediate problem. Undoubtedly the Davis

site traits could be traced far more widely than
done below, but whether this would notably in
crease our knowledge of its historical position
is debatable. It all comes to a need for the same
old remedies: more field work; more intensive
analyses and critical thought; more publication;
more thrashing of problems in conferences.

POSITION IN "CADDOAN"
ARCHAEOLOGY

There is still a strong tendency to regard
"Caddoan" archaeology as involving a single

rather unique cultural complex, existing in late
prehistoric times. Since an intensive study of

1 To cite but one example, several noted authorities
compiled Table XI in The Maya and Their Neighbors
(Vaillant, 1940), placing the Louisiana culture periods
alongside those in the Southwest, Mexico, Oaxaca, Maya
regions, and Peru. By what token can Tchefuncte be
equated in time with Pueblo II, Teotihuacan 5, and Monte
Alban 4; Marksville with Pueblo III and Aztec I; Troyville
with Aztec II; Coles Creek with Aztec III, and so on? Was
this based on any known specific traits in common, on
trade pieces, on separate chronologies that showed similar
dates regardless of culture content? Undoubtedly, good
reasons were advanced for the correlations made within the

Middle American province, but as for the Louisiana cul
tures, it is safe to state that they were so placed for no ap
parent reason other than to have something on the chart.

Without wishing to get too involved at present, I would

Figure 1. The Chupek site on Aquilla Creek bottomland near Brazos River above Waco, Texas, has yielded many sherds
easily identified as Alto Focus types; it was an outlying non-mound village of this focus. The McDonald, Keith, and Hale
mounds in Texas, and Mound Plantation site in Louisiana bear some relationship to Davis in the pottery of Phase 3, but
have not been adequately explored. The Smithport Landing, Wilkinson, Allen, Colbert, and Greer sites are recognized by
C. H. Webb as the principal components of the Alto Focus in Louisiana. The Gahagan burial-mound site is the sole com
ponent of Gahagan Focus. The Troyville and Crooks sites in central Louisiana are important components of the Troy ville
and Marksville cultures respectively; they indicate the probable direction of some trade pottery at Davis. The Sanders
site near Red River is the type site for Sanders Focus; part of the Yarbrough site belongs to this focus, both indicating
the source of Sanders Focus trade sherds at Davis. The Jaggers and Mustang Creek sites are outlying components of the
Spiro Focus which in eastern Oklahoma includes mounds on the Spiro site; Groseclose or Eufaula mound; the Hughes,
Norman, and Brackett sites; and in southwest Arkansas the Mineral Springs site. The Haley mound site in southwest
Arkansas is the type component of the Haley Focus, which also includes components at Hatchel in Texas and at Cren
shaw, East mound, Ozan 1, and Washington in Arkansas. The Chupek, Yarbrough, and Sanders sites are non-mound,
lying beyond the western limits of mound building.

data. For present purposes, the following

Gahagan traits are important:

1. The village site was apparently swept

clean before the mounds were erected. (This is
not capable of proof, for the village was buried
by subsequent silting and could only be viewed
in cross section from time to time while the
river sliced away its west bank.)
2. The burial pits were large, deep, and rec

this also followed a Hopewellian pattern. In

this case, however, the parallels are in the Mid
dle West rather than Florida, so far as our pres
ent knowledge goes.18 Evidence of cremation,
common in Hopewellian mounds, has not been

found at Gahagan.

5. A few sherds of Coles Creek, Belcher

Focus, and other types have been found on the

Gahagan site between the mounds, but only

Alto Focus types within the burial mound.
6. Only six pottery vessels were found in the

three graves. Five of these are clearly Alto
Focus types: Holly Fine Engraved, Hickory
Fine Engraved, and one fine engraved with
"stepped" design. Holly includes two black
bottles with long, tapered spout and one black
barrel-shaped vessel; Hickory is represented by

one bottle, and the "stepped" design is on a
beautifully polished, rich dark brown, small

mouthed bowl.19 The sixth vessel is a peculiar
bowl with flat base and outward-curving sides,

called by Webb "Coles Creek Incised" because
of its horizontally incised lines, but now re

garded as probably a variant of Davis Incised.20

A recent publication by the Heye Foundation22

marks below result partly from some personal
examination of the Craig Mound artifacts (the
heart of the ceremonial complex at the Spiro
site). My allocation of some other sites in Okla
homa, Texas, and Arkansas to the Spiro Focus
is entirely provisional, pending research on the
subject by those closer to it.
Orr has divided the Spiro-site materials into
three components: Early, Middle, and Late.The
Middle component was subdivided into an early
and late phase.23 It is not clear whether all com

ponents belong to a Spiro Focus, or only the

Middle component; it is my belief that the latter

is the case. If so, the actual Spiro Focus ma
terials were found principally in the Craig,

of course present at Gahagan, but we cannot
say that it was absent at Davis, the conical

Gahagan buildings are unknown.

ceremonial field. Most of the common traits

were of economic and household nature. The

26 To cite an example, Orr (1946, p. 236) states that 221
skeletons came from the Craig mound Middle component,

and that each burial contained from 2 to 31 individuals. The

number of burials is not given, but after stating that 5
were intrusive in the Brown mound, and that the two
Ward mounds yielded 10 single and group burials, a subse
quent passage says there were 39 burials "in the Middle
Component." This could mean that 24 were in the Craig
mound but there were other areas from which some could
have come. At any rate, pottery was found in all 39 burials,

but "it actually comprised only a small percentage of the

total number of individual artifacts . . . ." The Middle

component pottery is described under eight types, 1, 2, 5,
6, 7, and A, B, C, with the following number of vessels in
each: 0 (90 per cent of the village sherds), 0 (few sherds from
village), 57, 14, 3 (plus fragments in burials and village),
3,1, and 3. We have no way of knowing which types or how

many vessels were in individual graves, their association
with non-ceramic artifacts, or on what basis the types were

defined. The Coles Creek Incised and French Fork Incised

vessels are listed with the Early component (pre-Spiro
Focus?), but this has been questioned by others who worked
in the W.P.A. excavations. This point is crucial for cross

dating the Spiro Focus. One remark was that the Coles
Creek vessels were "if anything, in the later parts of the
Spiro culture," a situation made possible by the fact that
the culture sequence was based on gross depth of graves
rather than on the levels from which the grave pits were

dug. I have no doubt that there was a long sequence of
culture at the Spiro site itself, and that Orr did his best

with an unfortunate situation. The missing data and un
answered questions, however, make detailed comparisons

with other cultures difficult.

3. They bear certain strong similarities in

dark engraved and polished-over incised pottery
constituting a special mortuary ware at Spiro,

and possibly so at Davis. Orr's "Spiro 5 type"

includes most of the comparable pottery at that
site, consisting of bottles with tapered spouts,
hemispherical bowls, and cylindrical or barrel
shaped vessels, mostly with flat disc bases but
including some "round" (convex) bottoms and

some flat, square bases. The engraved decora

tions are fully as fine as in the type Holly Fine
Engraved dit Davis, but differ from the latter
in pattern; the lines are farther apart and ar
ranged in parallel series running horizontally,

vertically, and diagonally, sometimes supple
mented by nested or concentric arcs, but the
chief differences lie in (1) the common use of
spiralling scrolls with circle cores, (2) the use of
fine punctates in the scroll cores and various

other areas, (3) the lack of excising with the
engraved lines, and (4) repetition of design
units two to five (usually four) times. Spiro

designs generally cover the whole vessel,

we now call the Haley Focus complex. The
Lemley's report in 1936 furnishes much more
sinking of extremely deep graves through

information on Mounds B and D. Four great

graves dug in the subsoil and covered by Mound
B, and others dug into the body of Mound D,

produced the "pre-Caddo" complex, now re

garded as an important component of the Coles

Creek culture. Eleven graves in Mound B and
two in Mound D, dug from their tops, produced
a very different ceramic complex, called "Cad
doan." Lemley's cross sections plainly show the
relative positions of the pre-mound and post

mound graves, and we need not repeat the

details.

The four graves dug into the surface be

mounds into the sub-soil, multiple burials in
rows, and much richer ceramic offerings with

them, all point to the second set as a Haley
Focus component. Still a third set of small,

single burials, dug into the mound tops a short
distance, and into the fields nearby, produced
vessels of the Belcher and Texarkana foci of the
later general horizon called Fulton Aspect.
At this writing, I am at a loss to know what

the exact relationship was between the Coles
Creek and Haley foci at Crenshaw. They evi

by 15 feet, the largest 13 by 22 feet. The bodies
had been placed in neatly parallel positions but
not all in one row. In Pit 9, six lay in one row
southeast; and six lay in a staggered row in the

opposite direction, two of them with heads
northeast, one southwest, one northeast, and
two southwest in that order. In Pit 3, two rows

of three each with heads southeast filled one
end of the grave, one row of seven with heads
southeast (except one to the northwest) ran the
remaining length of the grave, and a fourteenth
ran at an angle off-center.
The pre-mound graves doubtlessly present a

conception very similar to that at Gahagan,

with one important difference: although there
was ample space in the graves, no offerings of

any kind appeared against the pit walls. The

burial goods consisted mainly of ornaments and
arrow points, and occasionally pottery, placed
on the bodies or close to them.

What concerns us here is not so much the

spectacular pre-mound graves, but the relation

from the mound tops all the way into the sub
soil, and even on through the pre-mound pits.

speaking, consist of a dominating temple mound,

mounds were present in a cluster, suggests (1) that the
dominating temple mound alone was built with clay from a

distances. A calculation of the cubic contents, even very
approximately, should provide a scale for comparing the

that no precise boundary can be defined in their
design arrangements. In general, the very wide

carinated bowls of the Davis site are missing
in the north, their place occupied by small
hemispherical ("deep, simple") bowls, others

with a high side and shallow bottom, and a few
of composite outline. The Crockett scrolls with

punctated or incised cores and flanks, with a
bisector line sometimes present to connect the
cores, is the same in both complexes, and fur

the Burial Mound periods, namely, Adena,
Hopewell, Marksville, and Copena, without
attempting to distinguish time differentials
between them. This is a complicated task and
far from solved. The recent book, Indians Be

maries of their general characteristics.

We may begin by considering a number of
attributes of Hopewellian and Woodland pot
tery in Illinois which appear in one way or an

other in the Davis site incised and punctated
pottery. Many of these appear widely in the

Hopewell complex and on Marksville and Troy
ville pottery; and some were probably of very
wide distribution in the Eastern United States.
They are therefore not offered as specifically

onward, and no further mention of them will

be made.

On the other hand, the greatly widened flat
lip on bowls is a much more restricted trait,
found at the Brangenberg Mounds (Table 20),
in Marksville and Troyville and Florida fiber
tempered pottery, and on many of the stone
bowls at Poverty Point,78 to name examples.
A trait not noted on Hopewellian pottery but
of interest in connection with specialized lips
is that of the thick lip of circular cross section
found at Davis on globular bowls in Crockett
Curvilinear Incised.79 It may be significant that
neither lips of circular cross section nor ring

punctates appeared until Phase 2 in the Davis
tabulations.

Most of these rright also occur in the Ga
hagan, Haley, and Spiro foci if we had more
information on artifacts not placed in burials.

The "Copena" blades of the Alto, Gahagan,
and Spiro foci provide a rather definite con
nection with Copena Focus alone.

Traits not found at the Davis site, but con

necting it with Burial Mound cultures indirectly

through the Gahagan, Haley, and Spiro foci
(already discussed in the previous sections) in

clude:

Mounds erected over important interments (and over
cremations at Spiro).
Burials fully extended on the back.
Cremations (Spiro and principally Hopewell and Adena in

east).

Destruction of artifacts placed in graves (Gahagan and

Spiro).

Galena in graves.
Large rectangular graves with multiple burials placed
parallel in row, heads mainly in one direction but some
placed end-for-end, and others placed at right angles,

also end-for-end in some cases (Gahagan and Haley;
Hopewell and Adena).81
Copious use of copper for ornaments, covering of beads and

ear spools, masks, etc., particularly at Gahagan and
Spiro.
Very few, highly selective, non-utility vessels placed in
graves (Gahagan and Spiro; Hopewell, Marksville, and
Adena; pottery not placed with dead in Copena, Tche
functe) .

Added to these are the specific traits common

to Gahagan and Florida Hopewell.82 The curi
ous resemblance in facial expression on the

human effigy pipes at Spiro and on Hopewellian
clay figurines, and the round knobs protruding

from the head in both cases, have been cited

(p. 202).
Temple Mound. The Alto Focus bears a

number of general features which would relate

it to Temple Mound periods in the usual sense.83

These include:

Building of platform "temple" mound in Phase 2.
Destruction of important buildings by fire (Features 9 and
35 of Phase 2; possibly others).
Intentional mound accretion, to cover buildings on platform
or to attain greater height above village, or both.

Tendency toward square buildings in Phase 2.
Wide range of pottery vessel forms, including bottles.
Decoration by engraving on polished vessels (cutting design
with sharp implement after firing and polishing).
Polishing over incised and punctated decoration.

Marked increase in size of vessels, especially cooking and
storage jars, in Phase 2 and after.
Strap and loop handles toward end of focus (very rare).
Small, light arrowpoints appear at end of Phase 1 or before
any part of mound erected.
Possibly pottery pipes as a general trait, the long-stemmed
form being confined to cultures west of the Mississippi.

In connection with temple mounds, it should

be noted that the great Troyville group in
central Louisiana was a far more highly de
veloped site than Davis, and probably a much

larger town commanding the efforts of a much
greater population. The symmetrically terraced

central mound, 180 feet square and 80 feet
high, around which were seven neatly rect
angular platform mounds and a high clay
wall,84 all suggest an orderly plan, great in
itiative, and probably more intensive cere

monials than the Davis inhabitants ever

dreamed of. The Davis mound seems to have

been raised with the one objective of having a

platform above the village, no attempt being
evident to make it square or any other definite

shape.

Coles Creek, following Troyville and also a
Temple Mound culture, likewise was featured
by carefully built mounds in some order around

a court or plaza. The relations of Davis to

either Troyville or Coles Creek are extremely
vague except for certain ceramic resemblances.
Our type Crockett Curvilinear Incised provides
certain strong ties in its scroll motifs to the
Coles Creek type French Fork Incised but lacks

the ring punctates at line ends; also to Troy
ville and Marksville incised scrolls. Other re
semblances and confusions are listed in Table

to regard any vessels with horizontal lines only
as (iColes Creek Incised" or related thereto.86
The type Davis Incised partly resembles Coles
Creek Incised but lacks the typical lips and it
would be hard to decide which was derived from
the other.

Certainly a major identifying trait of all
"Caddoan" units is the use of engraved de

signs, usually filled with red ocher (in the Ful
ton Aspect they also bear fillings of white and
occasionally blue or green clay). Engraving oc

curs at least as far eastward as Moundville,
Alabama, on highly polished, often black ves
sels,87 and as far north as southern Illinois and
the lower Ohio Valley. We will reserve discus
sion of its distribution and time factors for a

future publication on the Fulton Aspect. At

present, I believe there is a growing feeling that
its occurrence northward and eastward of the
"Caddo area" was due to diffusion from there.88

Within the "Caddoan" units themselves, en

graving on black and dark brown pottery was
a dominant feature of Phase 1 at Davis; hence,
in our present knowledge this must represent

its earliest appearance in the United States.

The question of its origin, unless independently
invented, lies in Middle American archaeology.
Summary. The chronological position of Alto
Focus offers two principal alternatives:
1. It falls entirely within the Temple Mound

1 or "Early Middle Mississippi" period, corre
lating with the other Gibson Aspect foci, and
these with Troyville and early Coles Creek, as
in my previous charts.89 In this case, the traits
suggestive of Burial Mound cultures through

out the Gibson Aspect do not provide a tem
poral correlation with Burial Mound, but can
be regarded as marginal survivals of the latter.90
86 E.g., Ekholm (1944, p. 426) mentions a possible relation
between Tancol pottery in the Tampico area and ceramics
of the Southeastern United States. This opinion was based
largely, I believe, on a minor occurrence of horizontal lines
on rims and lips and would seem to be a rather weak link,
if at all. His Figures 28, 29 show other sherds resembling

Yokena Incised and Marksville Red Filmed of Louisiana,
according to J. A. Ford.
87 Moore, 1905, 1907.

pp. 27-9.

89 Krieger, 1946, Fig. 26 and pp. 251-7; 1947a, Fig. 50.
90 Ford and Willey (1940, p. 143) state that "Intensive
investigations in the central part of the Mississippi Valley

2. A new correlation may be offered as a
consequence of the Davis site analysis and its
relations to the Gibson Aspect foci. It is im
possible to be precise about this alignment. It
may be expressed very roughly as shown in
Figure 66 (see next page).
Figure 66 will no doubt disturb those ac
customed to thinking of Mississippian cultures
as everywhere following the Burial Mound
periods. The whole "Caddoan" block cannot be
called "Mississippian" without some qualifica
tion, although I suppose most archaeologists
would hardly hesitate to do so on the basis of
polished engraved pottery, vessel forms, and
temple mounds alone. What the chart amounts
to, in simplest terms, is that a block of culture
generally thought of as part of the "Early Mis
sissippian" horizon was present in a large area
west of the Mississippi Valley proper at a time

roughly equivalent to Burial Mound II in the

valley and lands to the east.
I will not try to defend the second alternative

beyond the matters already cited. Whether
Spiro Focus was coeval with Hopewell, or at
least existed before Hopewell died out, is a

problem for others; even if such an idea were
proved ridiculous the facts would be interesting.

The chart also calls for the Davis primary

mound (Phase 2) to have been built before the

end of Burial Mound II times as reckoned in
the Mississippi Valley proper. All one can say

on that score is that it would be absurd to ex

pect all temple mounds to have sprung up
overnight in the Eastern United States, as re
cent charts suggest.

While no single one of the Davis site, Ga

hagan, and Spiro traits cited above would carry
any weight in a correlation with Burial Mound
II, collectively they are rather convincing to the

writer. The three strongest points at Davis

may be reiterated: association of the finely en
graved black pottery and sandy-paste ware (of
which some pieces even had engraved lines) in

Phase 1; the pronounced dominance of dart
points (eight types) over small arrow points

(a few Alba Barbed) in Phase 1; and the entrance

of trade sherds in Phase 2 which may be re

will very probably show that the widespread Middle
Mississippi cultures were developing at the same time,
principally from Hopewellian. One result to be expected
... is that traits directly comparable with those of Hope
wellian will appear sporadically in peripheral Mississippian

cultures and in the adjacent Woodland cultures at dates
very near the beginning of the historic period."

MIDDLE AMERICAN AFFILIATIONS

At this date I do not believe we have pro
gressed notably beyond Vaillant's excellent

little paper91 on comparable vessel forms in the

Southeast, Southwest, Mexico, and Central
America. Due to a virtual total lack of chrono
logical perspective in the Eastern United States

at that time, Vaillant was unable to state

whether vessel forms there could or could not
be correlated with similar ones in Middle Amer

93 Random examples from Peru appear in Kroeber
(1944), who shows various bottles with a central spout,

cylindrical vessels, hemispherical or simple bowls, bowls of

composite outline, etc.; his Plate 5, c is a bottle with
strongly tapered spout. Bennett (1944, Figs. 5, a, b, d, e
and 12, a, B, f-h) shows some vessel forms similar to those

at Davis; his Figure 28, a shows a wide range of greatly
widened, flattened and flanged lips quite similar to those
of Holly Fine Engraved and other Davis types; and Figure
29, a-k shows designs of deep ring punctates, vertical rows
of crescent-shaped punctates, and punctates within bands

much like those on some Davis, Hopewellian, and other

Eastern pottery. Howard (1947, Fig. 2, d) shows the
bottle form with central spout from Late Ronquin, Vene
zuela; and his Figure 11 shows utility jars with corrugated
necks, as well as bowls with three small conical legs, from
lowland Bolivia. Countless other such examples could be

cited.

94 Red-and-white painting is a feature of the central
Mississippi basin and Tennessee-Cumberland culture, not
occurring at all in the "Caddo area" unless on rare trade

for the Gibson Aspect as a whole, with red
filmed surfaces appearing in the Haley and

Sanders foci. Effigy vessels, as noted on page 216,
were not present in the earlier foci, but appeared

during the Haley and Sanders foci and Late
Spiro component. Effigy vessels presumably
were inspired by contact with the central
Mississippi basin, but they do not include the
human figures or heads found in the latter area;
their origin remains an intriguing part of the
Middle American problem even if they are not
a general trait of the Gibson Aspect.
Turning to Middle America, an excellent re

cent paper by Armillas traces the main lines

of its culture history, employing terms similar
to those now advanced for Peruvian history.

The periods discussed by Armillas, with the
time span he allows for each, are:98

is published,some of Dr. Kidder's comments
are given.
Grooved Plate Phase (Mamom)

The unslipped jars were generally raked below the neck.
The black-ware jars, often a grayish color, frequently have

chevron incising below neck. The red ware plates have
grooving on the lip and the tuff orange ware was occasion

ally incised. This phase has the archaic type figurine;
handles on the unslipped jars, usually horizontally placed;
no legs or feet; and no polychrome ware.

Basal Flange Phase (Tzakol)
Here we find the earliest polychrome; legs come in
abundantly, also the ring base and pedestal base, spouts,
handles, and covers; but there are no figurines (except
where they are cover handles). Plaster or fresco technique
is used and with it human figure design, but otherwise no
lifelike animal or human figures are portrayed. Conven
tionalization takes the place of humanistic or geometric

design.

Incurved Lip Phase (Tepeu)
Jar lips become more and more elaborate in form. Legs

and pedestal bases are present and polychrome ware is
abundant. Fine orange occurs, usually carved. The design
is humanistic and geometric for the most part. No spouts
and no covers but an abundance of figurines (whistles) of
the late type. Glyph band designs are numerous.

corners, finely-made paint-filled lines, and some

vessel forms (carinated bowls, simple bowls,

cylindrical and barrel-shaped) are of remarkable
likeness, and at least one of Kidder's manuscript
figures shows a carinated bowl with a bisected

meandering band formed by excising, nearly
identical to that in the present Figure 37, f.
As a sidelight on this interesting problem, it

may be well to point out that some Esperanza

fine incising, being very shallow and made with a needle
sharp point, wouldn't take filling. It was post-firing, ap
parently, as it was not affected by smudging, and the paste

is somewhat lighter in color than the surface. The coarse
was sometimes done in the moist clay before polishing,
sometimes cut into the fired vessel. The Miraflores complex

has a very limited territorial range, being practically con
fined, as far as we now know, to the Guatemala valley."
On October 31, 1947, Kidder wrote that "The Miraflores
specimens should date from the early years of the Christian
era, perhaps from 100 to 200 A.D. That, of course, is pretty

much guess work but is as near as I can estimate. Robert
Smith believes, and I agree with him, that Miraflores is
probably contemporaneous with Chicanel rather than with

Mamom. This is on typological grounds but there may
have been lags in one direction or another between the
Highlands and Peten . . . there was never any strong de
velopment of fine engraving in Chicanel. This was confined

to Miraflores . . . ."

He further describes the building outlines, 34 in

number, discovered under the mound, on a
great platform inside the mound, and in the
fields to the north, east, and south. The com
pleted mound was roughly L-shaped with one

leg running north-south along the modern high
way, the other extending eastward from it at
right angles, and expanding southward at its
eastern end.

The 34 buildings (two of them only partly
cleared) revealed large round patterns in a

village under the mound, and square patterns
on top of the platform inside it. Both patterns
were found in the field, and were presumed to

follow the same sequence of round to square

buildings found in the mound excavations. Two

buildings, Features 3 and 9, were "compro

mises" or essentially square with rounded sides.
The sub-mound round houses contained a large
central post (in one case, probably a living tree)
used during construction, then usually lopped
off when the building was completed. The cen
tral fireplace was then made where the post (or
tree) was removed. Several sub-mound houses
also had numerous oval cache pits in their floors,
most of them containing a step or shelf part way

was completed. The secondary mound (Zones

10, 10a) was much more homogeneous and com
pletely covered the primary mound just as the

latter completely covered the four initial
rounded mounds. The modern surface of the
entire mound was called Zone 11. The field ex
cavations were then divided into four more
"zones": 16, the deepest, for all locations over
30 inches below surface; 15, from 21 to 30
inches deep; 14, from 11 to 20 inches; and 13,
the modern plow zone or top 10 inches.
Following this, the zones were grouped into

a sequence of cultural stratigraphy. This process
actually resulted from the analysis of cultural
remains, for only after all artifacts and houses
were plotted by zones was it possible to group
them on the basis of breaks or changes in the

cultural material. It was seen then that the
eleven physical zones in the mound could be

grouped into three "phases" marked by a meas

ure of culture change. The term "phase" was

used to designate these divisions because it was
clear that no breaks in occupation had occurred.

I did not want to use "period" or "stage" or
"level," for there were no abrupt changes or
large-scale turnover in culture traits at any

point.

The cultural stratigraphy was worked out

in the mound entirely; the field material then
proved to parallel it quite closely from the deep
est zone (16) to the surface plow zone (13).
Following this, the pottery was described in

two major categories: the resident, or Alto

The non-pottery artifacts, surprisingly few in

number compared to potsherds, were then
briefly described and plotted (Tables 17-18).
Chipped projectile points and knives of flint

artifacts, or even suggestions thereof, is sur

shells were recovered from different parts of the

preserved enough so that artifacts should also

of much social and ceremonial activity. The
building of true earth mounds was extremely

all of eastern Texas, and probably not more
than that in Oklahoma.

the writer in June, 1948, shows its base is 650 feet long,
maximum height 36 feet, and a long ramp running up its
eastern side. Under a Viking Fund grant, excavations are
being conducted to determine the builders of this mound.
The vessels shown by Moore did not come from the mound,
but from a cemetery nearby. The Hatchel mound 12 miles
northwest of Texarkana was not as long as Davis but more

than twice as high.

b) A minor but important use of scrolls in an incised

northwestern Florida in Weeden Island Incised, both of
which types are generally believed to have developed from
the conventionalized bird designs and scrolls of Marksville
Hopewellian pottery.
c) A technique of fine engraving plus excising on highly

246 SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY [memoirs, 5
Woodlands. A highly tentative formulation of

the sequence and associations of these com

plexes in the areas north of Mexico is offered

below:

1. Hohokam-Basketmaker Complex. This complex appears
to have been the earliest in areas north of Mexico. It has its
affiliations in the Sierra Madre Occidental, whence it moved
into the Hohokam area at least as early as 200 to 100 B.C.

It persisted as the only type in Hohokam archaeology and,
to historic times, as the sole type in the agriculture of the
Pima, Papago, and the Yuman tribes of the lower Colorado.
It appeared in Basketmaker context in the San Juan area

by about 200 A.D. as the earliest type in Anasazi agricul

ture. It was absorbed by the Mexican Complex, which

entered in late Basketmaker or early Pueblo times. The re
placement was complete in most of the area, but a few Hopi
varieties contain influence of the former strain.

It spread through the Prairie area and reached the
Ozark Bluff Dwellings by about 500 to 600 A.D., appar
ently as the earliest type, and moved on to the Ohio rock
shelters. In the Prairie this complex mixed first with the
Mexican Complex and later with the Eastern Complex. In
the East it was absorbed by the Eastern Complex.

2. Mexican Complex. This complex is derived from the

Mesa Central of Mexico and came from there into the
United States, bypassing the Hohokam area and not af

fecting Eastern agriculture until much later. It reached the

Anasazi area by about 600 to 700 A.D., where it absorbed
the Hohokam-Basketmaker Complex almost entirely. This

dominance was maintained to the present in Pueblo
varieties.
It moved into the Prairie mixing with the Hohokam
Basketmaker Complex and affecting the corn of the south
ern part of the region more than that of the Upper Missouri.

It appears in very dilute form in late Mississippi sites in
Illinois and Kentucky. It may have reached Virginia by
early historic times.
3. Eastern Complex. This complex is derived from Guate
mala and has not been reported from northern Mexico. It

appears in the Eastern Woodlands as the dominant type
from Texas to the St. Lawrence. It probably moved up the
east coast of Mexico, reaching the Caddo area by about 700

A.D. It reached the New York region and the Upper Mis
souri by about 1200 A.D. In the Eastern Woodlands it ab
sorbed the earlier Hohokam-Basketmaker Complex. In the
Prairie it mixed with the earlier complexes, exerting more
influence in the northern part of the region, where relatively

pure varieties are found in modern Indian agriculture.

It moved westward into the Rio Grande region, reaching

there by about 1300 A.D. and mixing with the Mexican
Complex. It exerted little influence on the corn of the west
ernmost Pueblos, such as the Zuni and the Hopi.

This formulation may crowd the data a bit but
seems essentially in accord with the corn facts
and does no particular violence to archaeologi

cal concepts and chronologies. It has been de
vised without data, for instance, on Hopewell
or Mogollon corn types and, with other serious

gaps in data, is naturally subject to revisions.

If the current rumors of pod corn in association
with late Cochise material from Bat Cave, New

Mexico materialize, an earlier wave of corn in
that area naturally would be indicated.

What might seem to be the most revolu

tionary suggestions concerning the East have

been anticipated by Griffin's remarks published
in 1946:42

Certainly the Southwest offers archaeological evidence
locating corn closer to the western Mississippi Valley than
does any other area. Corn is found there early enough to
permit its spread eastward into the Ozark area in a cultural
context comparable to the Basketmaker.

He further comments that:
It is not until the Mississippi period that we have ex
tensive evidence, in open sites, of the use of corn. This is
particularly true of the lower Mississippi Valley and in the

Southeast.

Martin, Quimby, and Collier in discussing the

archaeological background of the eastern

United States scoop this appendix by stating,
with no supporting evidence offered, that:43

Some of the earliest corn may have come into the area
from Mexico by way of the Southwest. Some of the latest
corn in the region may have come from Guatemala via the
east coast of Mexico.

MacNeish noted no contact between the

Huasteca and the Southeast earlier than that
associated with ceremonial mounds.44 This
adds to the growing suspicion that the Wood
land Pattern had no direct connection with the

higher cultures of Mexico and southward. This

idea receives strong support from the corn
data. The Hohokam-Basketmaker type of corn
from the Southwest seems to have been the
earliest in the East. Evidence of its priority
can be found in traces of it in the Quebec Flint
corn cultivated by the Micmac at the extreme

northern periphery. Also, Anderson has in

formed me45 that Eastern flint corns show vari

ant forms suggesting dilution by Hohokam
Basketmaker and that such dilution is also
evident in inbred Eastern flints. The Basket

maker corn from the Southwest seems to have

been carried into the East on a movement of
low-level Basketmaker-like agriculture associ
ated with the digging stick and metate. In the

Ozark Bluff Dwellings, Harrington noted a

Cob form. The butts are expanded, flaring, and quite
broad in proportion to the remainder of the cob. Below the
butt the cobs taper gradually to the tip. The cobs are often
curved. The cobs are generally circular in cross section but
often tend toward angularity; thus 8-row cobs may be some

cobs hexagonal.
The three cobs in lot 2064 which were noted as divergent
are somewhat elliptical in cross section and taper from the

another type, but more likely are abnormalities or nubbins.

original length of the cobs can be gained perhaps from the
amount and rate of taper in the cobs. The average degree of

taper is about 0.06 cm. per centimeter of length. If the

Row pattern and row numbers. The rows are generally
quite straight but an occasional tendency to spiral was
noted, particularly in areas near the butts. In most speci
mens the rows are distinctly paired, usually with a notice
able groove, and this feature too is accentuated near the
butts. As noted above, the pairing of the rows often results
in angular cross sections of the cobs.

The row numbers noted were 8, 10, and 12. There were
apparently none with row numbers in excess of 12. The per

centages of segments with different row numbers varied
from lot to lot. In lot 3103a there was a complete absence of

Kernels. No kernels were present in the material, but
something of their size at least can be deduced from the
limitations offered by the cobs. Judging by the circumfer

averaged about 6 to 7 mm. in width. Judging by the spac

our hypothetical ear length of 13.3 cm. there would be
about 53 kernels per row from butt to tip. One can only
guess at the length of the kernels, but such a guess can be a
reasoned one. Crescent-shaped (broader than long) kernels
are usually associated with cobs of the type in this material,
so it would seem likely that the kernels were about 4.5 to
5.5 mm. long.

Davis Site Types and Groups Possibly Conflicting Louisiana.Types
Pennington Punctated-Incised ^Rhinehardt Punctated, earUy Coles Creek period type.

Punctates simple, triangular, and ring-shaped, some
times in bands or in zones outlined by incised lines,
incl. triangles pendant from rim. Forms include the

"cauldron" (cylindrical), barrel, and carinated bowl.

"Free punctates", possibly Pennington included in Rhinehardt Punctated,
variants but on different range of vessel

forms (Table 14).

Weches Fingernail Impressed, in which a ^Included in Rhinehardt Punctated,
minor element consists of crescent-shaped
punctates arranged in vertical rows with
out the usual interspaced horizontal lines
(clearly a variation of Weches at Davis).

Crockett Curvilinear Incised 1 *French Fork Incised, early Coles Creek and Troyville

periods. No conflict with typical features such as scroll
bisector lines ending in large triangular pits or ring

punctates, which are absent at Davis. However, scrolls

and scroll bands without line-ending punctates are also
included and are very similar to typical Crockett de

signs. Vessel forms on the whole are distinct but over
lap. Some Crockett sherds have possibly been called
French Fork Incised.

Crockett Curvilinear Incised *Churupa Punctated, Marksville period. Ancestral to

French Fork Incised, differing in lesser use of hemicon
ical punctates, while both use plain and triangular punc
tates. In Crockett all three kinds of punctates common,

as are scroll motifs, rings, triangles, and miscellaneous
curvilinear designs. Churupa, Crockett, and French

Fork Incised are plainly different types but share so
many specific attributes that a closer definition of all

three is needed.

Dunkin Incised, especially cylindrical ves- *Mazique Incised, Coles Creek period. Lines placed diag
sels with grids or zones of parallel lines onally in grids or vertically on body; also alternating
in diagonal patterns on upper part or rim. triangles filled with parallel lines, sub-panels of diagon
al lines separated by single vertical lines; "cauldron"
form most common. "Flat shallow bowls", folded rims,
and lines ending in punctates occur here but not in the

Dunkin type. Mazique designs "may be a development

of the cross-hatched rim design of the Marksville period",
and same may be said of the crossed diagonals on the rim

of some Dunkin Incised vessels.

Described by Ford and Willey in Haag (1939).
