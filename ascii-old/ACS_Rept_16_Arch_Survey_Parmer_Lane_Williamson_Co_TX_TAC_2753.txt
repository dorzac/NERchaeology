Abstract
Cultural Resource Survey of the Parmer Lane Extension Project,
FM 2243 – SH 29, Williamson County, Texas
Archaeological and Cultural Sciences Group (ACSG) conducted an intensive archaeological
survey of the proposed extension of Parmer Lane between Farm to Market (FM) 2243 and State
Highway (SH) 29 in Williamson County, Texas from January 24, 2002 until April 02, 2002 and
excavated backhoe trenches on April 02, 2002 (Figures 1, 2, and 3). The project area consists of
the 3.7-mile long, 200-ft wide, County-controlled Right-of-Way (ROW) of the proposed
extension of Parmer Lane between FM 2243 and SH 29. An additional 500 ft on either side of
the ROW is included within the Area of Potential Effects (APE) for historic structures and land.
A records search was conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and
the Texas Historical Commission (THC) in order to locate any previously recorded historic and
prehistoric cultural resources in the project area. With the benefit of this research a 100%
pedestrian survey of the entire study area was performed. Shovel testing was performed in
upland areas where soil depth exceeded 10 cm. Backhoe trenching was used as a supplement to
shovel testing in the floodplains to test for buried sites using an informal, stratified sampling
strategy.
There are four previously recorded prehistoric sites near the proposed project area and one site
recorded within the project area. Sites 41WM90, 41WM106, 41WM107, and 41WM109 are
located along the South Fork of the San Gabriel River. Site 41WM104 is located within the
ROW. There are no previously recorded historical sites within the project area.
During the pedestrian survey, one unrecorded archaeological site was located within the 500-ft
APE for historical structures and properties. Site 41WM1043 is a twentieth century homestead
site that is comprised of a surficial scatter of household artifacts and a cylindrical well covered
with cut limestone blocks. No standing structures or foundations remain. Due to the heavily
disturbed nature of the site, no further work is warranted.
All shovel tests and backhoe trench tests were negative, except Shovel Test 16 at 41WM1043,
which contained colorless glass fragments at 0-5 centimeters below the surface (cmbs). These
artifacts were not collected,
Due to the heavily disturbed nature and sparse remains of 41WM104 and 41WM1043, the sites
have negligible research value. No further work is warranted. It is ACSG’s recommendation
that construction of the Parmer Lane extension and improvement be allowed to begin without
delay. This report follows the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) guidelines and is designed
to satisfy State and Federal laws and regulations. The findings of the cultural resource survey
and records search are summarized and assessments and recommendations concerning cultural
resources are presented. A brief environmental background is provided. No artifacts were
collected during the survey.

Introduction
Archaeological and Cultural Sciences Group (ACSG) conducted an intensive
archaeological survey of the proposed extension of Parmer Lane between FM 2243 and
SH 29 in Williamson County, Texas from January 24, 2002 to April 04, 2002 and
excavated backhoe trenches on April 04, 2002. The proposed road extension is
approximately 3.7-mile long and is located west of Georgetown, Williamson County,
Texas (Figure 1). The proposed road will cross the South Fork of the San Gabriel River
and two of the river’s unnamed, ephemeral tributaries. Only the South Fork of the San
Gabriel has significant alluvial deposits.
As a State entity, Williamson County is obligated to comply with the Texas Antiquities
Act and the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Texas Antiquities Act. These rules
are interpreted and enforced primarily by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). After
a visit to the project location, an initial scope of work was formulated to comply with the
Texas Antiquities code. The stated goal of the Antiquities Code of Texas is, “to locate,
protect, and preserve all sites, objects, buildings…, and locations of historical,
archeological, educational, or scientific interest, including but not limited to prehistoric
and historical American Indian or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites,
archeological sites of every character…within the jurisdiction of the State of Texas.” The
THC approved this initial scope of work and Texas Antiquities Permit #2753 was issued
to Sean R. Nash as principal investigator for Archaeological and Cultural Sciences Group
(ACSG).

Potential Impacts
The road construction will impact all surface areas within the limits of construction. In
upland areas, impact to bedrock is anticipated. In the deeper sediments of the floodplains
only bridge supports and abutments will impact sediments deeper than 1.5 m. Backhoe
trenches were concentrated in the areas that will have the deepest impacts. The potential
effects on historical properties include alterations of the setting, location, or use (this
includes historic structures within 500 ft of the ROW).

Environmental Background
Physiography
The property is located at the southern end of the Lampasas Cut Plain (Barnes 1974). A
rich ecotone, where three physiographic provinces intersect, encompasses the area of the
project. The property is within the upper reaches of the Brazos River drainage system
(Collins 1998:6). This landform is characterized in the area of the project by rolling
limestone uplands dissected by broad, shallow valleys. Karst features are common in the
region.
The proposed road will cross the South Fork of the San Gabriel River and two of its
unnamed, ephemeral tributaries. The river is located approximately 2.9 km north of FM
2243. Only the South Fork of the San Gabriel River has significant alluvial deposits.

Flora and Fauna
Upland soils are thin to non-existent and support a live oak savanna. Ashe juniper,
agarita, and prickly pear cactus are common. Within the floodplains of the South Fork of
the San Gabriel River, moderately deep alluvium supports riparian forests. Blair’s (1950)
Texan and Balconian biotic provinces meet in the area of the property and the flora and
fauna of both provinces can be found. During the survey, deer and jackrabbits were
observed within the project area.
Geology and Soils
Lower Cretaceous Keys Valley Marl, Edwards Limestone, and Comanche Peak
Limestone outcrop on the surface of the area and are exposed in the uplands north and
south of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River. Eckrant-Georgetown association soils
cover the upland portions of the project area. These are described as “very shallow to
moderately deep, calcareous and noncalcareous, stony, cobbly, and loamy soils formed in
indurated fractured limestone; on uplands” (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil
Conservation Service [USDA, SCS] 1983). In the lower elevations of the uplands, shovel
tests revealed mostly Denton-Eckrant-Doss association soils. These are described as
“moderately deep, shallow and very shallow, calcareous, clayey, cobbly and stony soils
formed in indurated limestone or limy earths; on uplands” (U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service [USDA, SCS] 1983). Oakalla-Sunev association
soils fill the floodplains of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River. These are “deep,
calcareous, loamy soils formed in alluvium; on bottom lands and stream terraces” (U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service [USDA, SCS] 1983).

Archaeological and Historical Background
Prehistoric period
There are four previously recorded prehistoric sites within 600 m of the proposed ROW,
and one previously recorded site (41WM104) within the proposed ROW. This site is
located at 251 m above mean sea level (AMSL) on the north bank of the South Fork of
the San Gabriel River, west of CR 268.
The University of Texas investigated 41WM104 in October 1963 during an
archaeological survey of the floodplain of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River.
According to TARL records, 41WM104 is surficial lithic scatter located on a river
terrace. Several artifacts were collected from the surface. Among these were eight
unidentified projectile points, 17 unifacial scrapers, three potsherds, various biface
fragments, debitage, and an 1841 United States dime. Site 41WM104 was found to be
heavily disturbed by plowing. James Corbin of the University of Texas recommended

limited testing of the site. ACSG personnel revisited site 41WM104 and confirmed that
the site is strictly surficial and very sparse in nature. Backhoe Trench Test 1, which was
executed at 41WM104, was negative with no artifacts observed or collected. ACSG
concluded that the site has very little research value due to past cultivation and surface
collection.
Sites 41WM90, 41WM106, 41WM107, and 41WM109 are not located within the ROW.
These sites are located along the South Fork of the San Gabriel River. 41WM109 and
41WM90 are located on the eastern side of CR 268. 41WM107 and 41WM106 are
located on the western side of CR 268.
The University of Texas investigated these sites in October 1963 during the cultural
survey that located 41WM104. Site 41WM90 consists of a heavily disturbed burned rock
midden feature and an associated surficial lithic scatter. Two unidentified projectile
points, two unifacial scrapers, and two bifacial blades were collected from the surface.
The site had been heavily disturbed by plowing. For this reason, no further work was
recommended by the University. Site 41WM106 is a large burned rock midden feature.
TARL records indicate that the site had been looted but much of the feature remained
intact. No cultural materials were collected during the 1963 survey, but chert flakes were
observed in the area of the site. Due to the extent of the midden, limited testing was
recommended by the University. Site 41WM107 is a large burned rock midden feature
that had also been heavily disturbed by looting. One unidentified projectile point and two
biface fragments were collected from the surface. Due to the extent of the midden
deposits, the University recommended further testing of the site. Site 41WM109 is
comprised of three burned rock midden features, which all showed signs of looting. One
drill was collected from the surface and chert flakes were observed in the area of the
features. The University recommended further testing of these middens as well.
Historic Period
There are no previously recorded historic sites within or near the project area.

Methods
A 100% pedestrian survey was conducted for Williamson County to “identify obvious or
well known properties” and “areas where certain kinds of properties are likely to occur”
[36 CFR part 64] (Derry et. al. 1985, King et. al. 1977). These include both historic and
prehistoric aged properties. A thorough record search was completed in order to
determine: (1) if there were any recorded sites within the project area; and (2) the nature
of the recorded sites in the general area. Based on this data, a strategy for an intensive
archaeological survey of the project area was devised. The survey strategy included a
100% pedestrian survey, shovel testing, and backhoe trenching.
Sites as defined by Hester et al. (1997:42) are “any discrete bounded location where
humans lived, worked, or carried out a task - and where evidence of their behavior can be
recovered by the archaeologist.” For practical purposes, any area where three or more
artifacts were found within a 10-m diameter was recorded. Isolated artifacts would be
plotted on a USGS 7.5’ topographic map.

For historical structures and associated lands, a 100% pedestrian survey was conducted
for Williamson County to determine if the undertaking would “cause changes in the
character or use of historic properties, if any such properties exist” [36 CFR § 800.2(c)].
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) defines an adverse effect
as any alteration in the features of a property “that may qualify the property for inclusion
in the National Register” [36 CFR § 800.9(a)]. The features may include the setting,
location, or use of the property. For the purposes of this survey, historical structures
within 500 ft of either side of the ROW were considered to be within the APE.
One site (41WM104) was previously recorded within the proposed project area.
Two separate methodologies were employed: one for the uplands, and one for the
floodplains. The upland strategy was simply to walk the right of way in parallel paths, 20
meters apart across the unpaved areas and perform shovel tests in places where soils
appeared to exceed 10 cm in depth. A visual inspection of the APE outside the ROW
was also conducted, primarily from the edge of the ROW. If any view of the APE were
obstructed, then the area in question would be more closely examined. The floodplain
was also the subject of a 100% pedestrian survey. Because of the possibility of well
preserved archaeological sites in the deep floodplain deposits, 7 backhoe trenches were
dug using an informal stratified random sampling strategy. All naturally exposed profiles
were examined.
Pedestrian Survey
Overall good ground visibility in the project area allowed for a confident appraisal of the
open upland areas. Wooded areas had only fair to poor ground visibility. Areas of better
visibility within the poor visibility areas received additional attention. Further, wooded
areas usually coincided with areas of deeper soils and were subject to shovel testing.
The floodplains had poor to fair visibility due to heavy vegetation, leaf litter, and flood
debris. If an artifact were found, the surrounding area would be cleared and carefully
searched. Notes were taken describing conditions, environmental factors, and any other
factors affecting the survey. Furthermore, photographs were taken of environmental
settings, cultural artifacts, and features encountered during the survey.
Shovel and Backhoe Testing
Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in diameter and dug to bedrock or sterile clay.
Shovel test locations were mapped by GPS (Figure 2). Notes were taken describing the
zone, depth, soils, stratigraphy, and any artifacts found. Whenever a site was located
during the pedestrian survey, additional subsurface testing was conducted to evaluate the
depth and nature of cultural deposits. Backhoe trenching was used in the floodplains to
test for buried sites using an informal stratified sampling strategy (Figure 3). The
trenches were approximately 4 m to 8 m long, 2 m wide and dug to the water table,
bedrock, or the reach of the backhoe. Profiles were examined, described, and
photographed. Representative profiles were drawn and/or photographed.

Results of Field Investigations
Pedestrian Survey Results
41WM1043
Description:
One new archaeological site was recorded during the pedestrian survey. 41WM1043, a
twentieth century homestead site, is located at the northwestern corner of the intersection
of FM 2243 and CR 268. It is located within the 500-ft APE for historical structures and
properties, but it is not located within the 200-ft ROW. There are no standing structures
or foundations at the site. The site is not eligible for nomination to the National Register
due to its heavily disturbed state and inconsequential historical affiliation. The site
consists of a surficial scatter of twentieth century artifacts and an associated circular well,
which is presently covered with cut limestone blocks (Figure 4). No other historical
features were evident at the site.
Site History:
The son of Geneva L. Keith, the owner of the property, informed ACSG personnel that
the site marked the location of a house that his father had constructed during the 1920s.
The current property owner and her family lived in the house for a few years and then
moved into an improved residence on the property. 41WM1043 was then occupied by
migrant farm workers until the house was dismantled sometime during the 1960s.
Cultural Materials Collected/Observed:
A surficial scatter of historical artifacts was observed at 41WM1043. The area of the site
is an open field, and the nucleus of the scatter is concentrated in a grove of trees. The
artifacts consist primarily of glass and ceramic fragments, but a fork/spoon handle, an
unidentified metal object, and a square nail were also observed. The site appears to have
been heavily disturbed by past agricultural activities (e.g. plowing and grazing). Due to
the fragmentary nature of many of the artifacts, few diagnostics were collected.
However, three glass container finish fragments that were collected from the surface
suggest a twentieth century utilization of the site. These container fragments display a
continuous seam running through the collar and finish. This seam is an attribute of glass
containers produced by automated machinery, which was introduced into the glass
manufacturing process during the early twentieth century. No diagnostic artifacts
predating the twentieth century were observed at 41WM1043.
Assessment:
Site 41WM1043 has very little research value due to its heavily disturbed and sparse
surficial distribution. The artifacts observed and collected represent an early to mid –
twentieth century component. No diagnostic artifacts from the nineteenth century were
observed. In addition, there are no extant historical structures (e.g. house, barn,
outbuildings) located at 41WM1043. Photographs, field notes, map drawings, and site
recordation through TARL, and have exhausted the research potential of the site.

Figure 4. A well covered with cut limestone blocks (41WM1043).

Much of the ROW for this project is located within the uplands north and south of the
South Fork of the San Gabriel River. In the upland areas, Lower Cretaceous Keys Valley
Marl, Edwards Limestone, and Comanche Peak Limestone outcrop at various intervals on
the surface of the area (Figure 5, 6). The soils within the area are heavily deflated and in
some cases non-existent (Figure 6). The upland areas contain thick cedar breaks with
very little ground cover. Surface visibility is often good to excellent due to numerous
patches of exposed soil and degrading bedrock (Figure 6). The lower elevations within
the upland areas contain moderately deep Denton-Eckrant-Doss association soils. Since
these areas often coincide with open pastures and tilled ground, visibility is good.
However, the possibility of finding intact archaeological deposits within these areas is
very low due to repeated plowing.

The floodplain of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River contains substantial amounts
of alluvium overlain by Oakalla-Sunev association soils. Bedrock and stratigraphic
profiles of high-energy alluvial deposits were observed in many areas along the riverbed
and cut-banks (Figure 7 and 8). During the survey, the river exhibited signs of recent,
intense flooding (Figure 8 and 9). Large uprooted trees and modern refuse deposits were
observed along the river’s heavily eroded, cut-banks (Figure 9). Visibility along the
floodplain was poor due to the large amounts of recently deposited flood debris. No
cultural materials were observed within the 100-year floodplain (except at site
41WM104, which has been heavily disturbed by plowing).
Alluvial deposits are confined to the areas immediately adjacent to the river channel.
Due to the significant slope (6 percent) south of the river, only a thin mantel of colluvium
covers the bedrock (see Shovel Testing Results). In some areas, the surface was covered
by a layer of bedrock fragments (Figure 9). North of the river, the floodplain is
characterized by deep alluvial deposits. However, much of this area has been heavily
plowed.

A large, modern refuse dump (Figure 10) is located approximately 1.7 km north of the
South Fork of the San Gabriel River, on the western side of CR 268. The dump area
contains three man-made stock tanks, a mobile home chassis (Figure 11), and a large
excavated pit containing modern refuse (e.g. sheet metal, lumber, tires, and misc.
automotive parts). The mobile home chassis and objects in its immediate vicinity show
thermal damage; thus, indicating a substantial fire has taken place at the site. There are
copious amounts of mid to late-twentieth century artifacts within the area but no
diagnostic artifacts predating the mid-twentieth century were observed.

Figure 11. Burned mobile home chassis.

An isolated projectile point base fragment (Figure 12) was located in an upland setting
north of a 90-degree bend in CR 268. The area of the isolated find consists of exposed
bedrock (Figure 6), thick juniper breaks, and an intermittent drainage. The intermittent
drainage contains very little alluvium. For the most part, the drainage bed is comprised
of exposed bedrock and pebble to cobble size limestone fragments. No water was present
in the drainage at the time of the survey. The surface of the area adjacent to the drainage
is covered with pebble to cobble size stones and a thin layer of leaf litter. Visibility
within the area was good to very good due to the minimal ground cover (Figure 12). No
other artifacts were observed in the area.

A twentieth century refuse scatter (Figure 13) was located in the northern-most section of
the ROW, between CR 268 and SH 29. The scatter is located ~3 m north of CR 268 and
appears to be the result of roadside dumping. It consists of a dense concentration of cans,
bottles, fragmentary ceramics, and miscellaneous domestic artifacts. The concentration
fans out several meters in an easterly direction and many of the objects are partially
buried by leaf litter and sediment. It appears that the dispersal and burial of items is the
result of intermittent roadside flooding. No historical features were observed within the
area of the scatter. Due to the abundance of metal, glass, and ceramic materials and the
corresponding lack of plastic and aluminum items, the artifacts in the assemblage most
likely represent a mid-twentieth century component. No diagnostic artifacts predating the
mid-twentieth century were observed within the scatter.

Shovel Testing and Backhoe Trenching Results

Backhoe Trench Test Results
Seven backhoe test trenches were dug into the floodplains of the South Fork of the San
Gabriel River (Figure 3). All backhoe trenches tested negative for cultural materials.

Figure 16. Lower section of Backhoe Trench Test 4.

A deep, steep-sided errosional gully is located on the northern side of the river, running
parallel to CR 268 on the eastern side of the road. The walls of the gully provided a
continuous, ~200-m long profile of terrace deposits. The entire length of the natural
profile was examined. No evidence of cultural activity was evident.
Backhoe Trench Test 1 was executed at site 41WM104 (a sparse lithic scatter) in order to
determine the nature and extent of subsurface cultural deposits. The results were
negative with no artifacts observed or collected. The sparse lithic scatter is confined to
the surface, which has been plowed repeatedly. Due to the disturbance of the site caused
by decades of plowing and the strictly surficial distribution of cultural materials, no
further work is warranted.
Backhoe Trench Tests 1 – 3 and 5 – 6 revealed stratigraphic profiles of Sunev silty clay
loam.

Typically, the upper layer is dark grayish brown silty clay loam about 18 inches
(45.7 cm) thick. The subsoil, to 52 inches (132 cm) is light yellowish brown silty
clay loam. The underlying layer, which extends to 60 inches (152.4 cm), is
reddish yellow silty clay loam and has many soft masses and concretions of
26

calcium carbonate (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service
[USDA, SCS] 1983).

Backhoe Trench Tests 4 and 7 revealed stratigraphic profiles of Queeny clay loam, which
is found along the edge of ancient stream terraces.

Typically, the surface layer is calcareous, moderately alkaline clay loam about 13
inches (33 cm) thick that is dark grayish brown in the upper part and brown in the
lower part. The underlying layer from 13 (33 cm) to 32 inches (81.3 cm) is
bedded gravel, sand, and fine earth. The upper part of the gravel layer is strongly
cemented by caliche (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service
[USDA, SCS] 1983).

Shovel Test Results
Shovel Tests 1 – 5 are located in the northern section of the project area, north of a 90
degree bend in CR 268 and south of SH 29 (Figure 2). Shovel Test 1 (Figure 18) is
situated at the head of a draw that contains an intermittent drainage. The area contains
exposed bedrock and a surficial scatter of pebble to cobble size limestone fragments. It is
27

also heavily wooded with junipers. The shovel test revealed a thin layer (0 – 28 cmbs) of
humic soil mixed with angular, pebble to cobble size, bedrock fragments. Bedrock was
exposed 28 cmbs. Shovel Test 2, which was conducted north of Shovel Test 1 and north
of the draw, revealed Eckrant cobbly clay 32 cm deep. Bedrock was exposed at 32 cmbs.
Shovel Tests 3 and 4 revealed a profile of Georgetown stony clay loam, which has a layer
of brown, stony clay underlain by a layer of reddish brown, cobbly clay. Charcoal and
burned rocks were observed at 0 – 15 cmbs in Shovel Test 4 (Figure 19). However, clear
evidence of recent brushfires (e.g. burned trees, charcoal, and burned rocks on the
surface) was noted in the area of Shovel Test 4. Shovel Test 4 is located at the edge of an
unimproved road. The charcoal and burned rocks were surface materials that were buried
by fill from the road construction.

Shovel Test 5 (Figure 20) is located between CR 268 and SH 29, in the northernmost
section. The soil profile revealed Eckrant cobbly clay with many angular to subangular,
pebble to cobble size, stones. At 30 cmbs, the matrix becomes redder in color. Shovel
Test 5 is located in the area of the historical refuse scatter. However, no subsurface
artifacts were observed or collected.

Shovel Tests 6 – 10 are located along the intermittent drainage where Shovel Test 1 was
executed. The soil profiles revealed Doss silty clay. It consists of highly humic, brown
silty clay loam with subangular to rounded, pebble to cobble size, limestone fragments
throughout. Two chert fragments were found at 0 – 20 cmbs in Shovel Test 7. However,
Shovel Tests 1 and 6, which were executed near Shovel Test 7, were negative, with no
artifacts observed or collected.
Shovel Tests 11 – 13 are located along the northern slope of the floodplain of the South
Fork of the San Gabriel River. Shovel Test 11 is situated near the crest of the slope.
Shovel Tests 12 and 13 are located in an open field midway down the slope. The area of
Shovel Test 12 and 13 (Figure 21) is currently being used as pastureland for cattle. The
soil profiles were consistent with Doss silty clay.
Shovel Tests 14 – 25 are located south of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River, on the
gently sloping northern slope of the Brushy Creek drainage basin. Shovel Test 14
revealed a soil profile of Denton Silty Clay. Shovel Tests 17 – 18 and 20 – 25 revealed
Eckrant cobbly clays (Figure 22). Shovel Test 16 (Figure 21), which is located at
41WM1043, contains Crawford clay. One metal washer, two clear glass fragments, and a
square nail were found at 0 – 5 cmbs. Shovel Test 19, which is located in a pecan
orchard on the eastern side of CR 268, revealed very humic Fairlie Clay (Figure 22). The
orchard contains newly planted trees and appears to have been recently cultivated.

Shovel Test 26 (Figure 10) was performed within the valley of the South Fork of the San
Gabriel River southwest of the CR 268 crossing. The valley walls rise at a 6 percent
slope and no significant alluvial deposits have agraded. The profile revealed by the
shovel test colluvium consisting of a homogenous, dark brown, sandy clay loam with
small to large pebble sized, subangular to rounded, limestone fragments throughout.
Bedrock was exposed at 26 cmbs. No cultural materials were observed in or collected
from Shovel Test 26.

Conclusions
Within the permit area of the project, a thorough intensive survey has been completed.
Results of a careful 100% pedestrian survey, shovel testing, backhoe testing, and archival
research indicate that there is no significant cultural resource within the ROW of the
proposed Parmer Lane Improvement Project. Only 2 sites were found to exist within the
ROW: 41WM104 (the prehistoric site) and 41WM1043 (the historic site). The historic
site (41WM1043) was discovered during this survey. No standing structures remain at
the site and there are no significant archaeological deposits. Site 41WM104 is surficial
and has been the subject of surface collection by University of Texas archeologists.
Routine contour plowing has also impacted the site.

Recommendations
Sites 41WM104 and 41WM1043 are so heavily disturbed that no research value is
ascribed to these sites. No further work is warranted. It is ACSG’s recommendation that
construction of the Parmer Lane extension and improvement be allowed to begin within
delay at this time. If any cultural remains are encountered during construction, all work
should cease, and an ACSG professional archaeologist should be called to assess the site.
If the site is assessed to be significant, further consultation with the THC should be
pursued.
