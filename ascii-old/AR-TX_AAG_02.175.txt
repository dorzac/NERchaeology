ABSTRACT
A Phase I archaeological survey was conducted on the proposed
Early/Zephyr Water Supply Corporation Water Line Project in Brown County, Texas,
under the auspices of Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5824 and Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The project area is located in central Brown
County within the corporate limits of the city of Brownwood and the city of Early The
total study area is approximately 8.48 miles (44,604feet) in length. Due to restricted
land access, pedestrian Survey level field investigations were conducted over several
months by American Archaeology Group, LLC (AAG) of Lampasas, Texas in
November and December 2010, and January, February, and December 2011. The prefield review indicated that two previously recorded archaeological sites were located
along the proposal project alignment (41BR497 and 41BR498).
Site 41BR497 was recorded as a prehistoric occupation site in which radiocarbon
dating of freshwater musselshell (Beta Analytic Sample Number 319839) yielded a
Conventional Radiocarbon date of 2,460 +/- 30 B.P. (Before Present) (Appendix III),
thus indicating cultural deposits dating to Late Archaic in age.
Site 41BR498 was recorded as a prehistoric occupation site in which radiocarbon
dating of freshwater mussel shell (Beta Analytic Sample Number 319840) yielded a
Conventional Radiocarbon date of 3,970 +/- 40 B.P. (Appendix III), thus indicating
cultural deposits dating from Late Early Archaic to Middle Archaic in age.
Both sites were relocated within the floodplain of Adams Branch and both
contained intact buried cultural deposits. Two new prehistoric sites were found during
the course of this investigation and recorded as 41BR584 (a low rise burned rock
mound) and 41BR585 (a surface lithic scatter). Proposed boring operations under
sites 41BR497 and 41BR498 will not impact these two locations. No further work is
recommended at these areas unless boring operations are not undertaken or an alternative
route is found for the water line project. Else, these two sites are deemed eligible for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and worthy of
designation as a State Archeological Landmark. Site 41BR584 was avoided by shifting
the proposed water line alignment by sixty feet to avoid and preserve this site. If any
future impacts are planned near this area, it is considered for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and worthy of designation as a State Archeological
Landmark. Site 41BR585 did not contain any subsurface cultural materials or any
important artifact assemblage. Therefore, it is not considered eligible for inclusion on
the National Register of Historic Places nor worthy of designation as a State
Archeological Landmark. No artifacts were collected, therefore no curation occurred.

INTRODUCTION
In November and December 2010, and January, February, and December 2011,
American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) was contracted by the City of Early and the
Zephyr Water Supply Corporation through the engineering firm of Jacob and Martin Ltd.
to conduct an archaeological survey. It consisted of an 8.48 mile (44,604 feet) survey with
a 30- foot right-of-way for a newly proposed 24-inch water line buried 4-6 feet below the
surface. It will be installed by the Brown County Water Improvements District located on
Brownwood, Texasâ south side parallel to an existing line that runs northwest then
northeast across State Highway 67. A total of 30.72 acres was investigated. The project
area is depicted on the Bangs East, Brownwood, and Owens 7.5' USGS quadrangles
(figures 1-5).
The proposed waterline continues across a pasture in a northeasterly direction until it
intersects and runs along the north side of Adams Branch and Pecan Bayou. The proposed
route continues to the northeast across State Highway 183 then parallels an old railroad
grade until it ends at the juncture with Salt Creek Drive. The entire project is located
within the City of Brownwood and the City of Early in central Brown County. The U.T.M.
coordinates for the approximate center of the project area are Zone 14 Easting 501500 and
Northing 3512000. The nearest water sources are Adams Branch (which flows into Pecan
bayou) and Pecan Bayou that ultimately flows south into the Colorado River. The
topographic position of the project alignment ranges from 1,444â on the northeast end and
1,535â near the south. At its lowest point at Pecan Bayou, it is 1,330â above mean sea
level.
This project was reviewed by the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) on June 25,
2010, which indicated concerns related to the historic Brownwood Water Canal and Aqueduct
System constructed between 1937 and 1939 (Whitsett 2010). Whitsett (2010) further noted
that Henderson (2000) had encountered buried cultural deposits within two prehistoric
archaeological sites (41BR497 and 41BR498-see Appendix II) that would be impacted by
the current proposed project.
The Texas Historical Commission (THC) concurred and required an archaeological
survey to be conducted. Previous archaeological surveys in Brown County have identified
significant prehistoric and historic sites. AAG was hired to perform an archaeological
survey under the auspices of the Texas Antiquities Code pursuant to Antiquities Permit
Number 5824 and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The
research design was coordinated with the Archeology Division, Texas Historical
Commission and was designed to intensively survey the project area in order to identify all
prehistoric and historic archeological and/or architectural properties, which may be eligible
for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The methods used
during this study are discussed below in the Field Methods section of this report.

RESEARCH DESIGN
Records Check
Prior to entering the field, American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) will
contact the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, the
state repository for site records on Texas, to determine if previously recorded sites are
present in the project area. This task may be conducted by a personal visit to TARL or
by telephone.
As the library of AAG is very extensive, especially regarding reports for the
project area region, much of the archival work can be accomplished in-house. Since
AAG has conducted work in the area, much of the background work already has been
accomplished.
Permit Application
No fieldwork will commence until issued a permit from the Archeology Division
(AD) of the Texas Historical Commission. An application for an antiquities permit will be
submitted to AD-THC as soon as AAG receives Notice To Proceed. Normally, AAG
discusses the project with AD personnel before beginning any fieldwork. This is done to
ensure that both parties are in agreement as to the level of work required for this project.
Survey Methods
The entire project area will be 100% surveyed intensively utilizing the
pedestrian survey method that is supported by shovel testing and/or augering, and with
the examination of eroded and disturbed areas where cultural materials may be visible
on the surface. Michael R. Bradle will act as the Principal Investigator. Shovel testing,
augering, and backhoe trenching will meet and exceed the Minimum Survey Standards
For Texas established by the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
In areas of poor visibility, and environmental settings that have potential for
buried cultural materials, shovel testing will be required and tests will concentrate in
areas of high site probability across the project area. All excavated fill will be screened
through Â¼ inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests will be manually excavated into sterile clay
or bedrock when possible.
The survey crew will be equipped with shovel test forms, notebooks, camera,
compass, and a project area map for accurate plotting of shovel tests, backhoe trenches,
and archaeological sites. In addition to shovel testing as a means to identify buried
sites, select areas in alluvial settings or areas with some appreciable soil depth will
be subjected to backhoe trenching. All sites identified in the project area will be

7

mapped in the field and plotted on a topographic map. Site locations will also be
determined through the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS). Each site will be
recorded using the official State of Texas Archeological Site Form. In no case will the
survey crew work outside of the project area depicted on the project area map provided
by the client.
Only diagnostic artifacts will be collected from the surface. All artifacts
recovered through shovel testing will be collected. These specimens will be bagged and
recorded on a field sack log. They will be analyzed and prepared for eventual curation at
TARL unless a petition to discard is prepared and accepted.
The draft report will be submitted to AD-THC for review. Once the report has
been approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), copies will be
delivered to AD- THC and the client. AAG will maintain copies of the notes,
photographs, site forms, and any other records produced from the project deemed to be a
work product.

PROJECT ENVIRONMENT
General
The project area is located within the Texan biotic province as defined by Blair
(1950:110-102). This province includes the broad ecotone between the forests of the
Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces of eastern Texas and Oklahoma and the
grasslands of the western parts of these states (Dice 1943). According to Blair
(1950:100), the southwestern boundary is arbitrarily defined by soil type at the line
separating pedalfers from pedocals. The Balcones escarpment forms an abrupt western
boundary for the central part of this province in Texas, and the western boundary in north
Texas corresponds to the western boundary of the Western Cross Timbers. Rainfall in
the Texan province barely exceeds water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite
(1948) as a moist subhumid climate with a moisture surplus index of from zero to 20
percent. The project area consists of cleared fields on terraces. It ranges from 1444 to
1535 feet above mean sea level in the northwest section of the City of Brownwood
southwest of State Highway 279. Round Mountain is about 2 miles to the south.
Soils and Geology
The project area contains 18 different soil types that are are moderately deep and
deep, loamy and clayey soils commonly found in upland areas (Clower, 1980). The soil
types encountered were: Abilene clay loam 1 to 3 percent slopes and Abilene-Urban land
complex 0 to 2 percent slopes is a well drained, deep clay loam soil located on gently
sloping uplands; Callahan loam 1 to 3 percent slopes, Callahan-Throck complex 1 to 8
percent slopes, and Callahan-urban land complex 1 to 5 percent slope which consists of
well drained, moderately deep loam located on gently to strongly sloping plains; Deleon
silty clay 0 to 1 percent slopes which consists of a moderately well drained and deep
clayey and loamy alluvial sediments; Frio silty clay loam 0 to 1 percent slopes is a very
deep soil formed in loamy and clayey calcareous alluvium; Nukrum silty clay 1 to 3
percent slopes and Nukrum-Urban land complex 1 to 4 percent slopes is a soil that
formed in alkaline clayey alluvium; Owens-Harpersville complex 8 to 45 percent slopes
soil series are is shallow to deep over claystone bedrock; Rochelle fine sandy loam 1 to 5
percent slopes consists of a well drained fine-loamy, mixed soil on ancient terraces;
Rowena clay loam 0 to 1 percent slopes is a very deep loamy and clayey sediment;
Sagerton clay loam 0 to 1 percent slopes and Sagerton-Urban land complex 0 to 3 percent
slopes belong to the Sagerton-Nukrum Group which includes nearly level to gently
sloping, deep, loamy and clayey soils overlying clayey or loamy sediments; SpeckTarrant complex 1 to 5 percent slopes soil series was formed in residuum and colluvium
from indurated limestone; Winters fine sandy loam o to 1 percent slopes and Winters fine
sandy loam 1 to 3 percent slopes was formed in loamy and clayey alluvium. The local
soils are underlain by Pennsylvanian-aged limestones, shales and mudstones of the
Strawn Group and Des Moines Series (Bureau of Econonic Geology 1976).

According to Blair (1950:113), the most characteristic plant association of this province is a
scrub forest of Mexican cedar (Juniperus mexicana), Texas oak (Quercus texana), stunted
live oak (Quercus virginiana), and various less numerous species.
The project area is also located well within the Prairies Vegetation Region and the
Edwards Plateau Vegetation Region (Gould 1962). Vegetational species characteristic of
the region include Plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformus), Texas oak (Quercus texana), ashe
juniper (Juniperus ashei), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), cedar elm (Ulmus
crassifolia), cottonwood (Populus deltoides), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), elm (Ulmus spp.),
sumacs (Rhus spp.), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), agarita (Berberis trifoliolata),
Texas stillingia (Stillingia texana), yucca (Yucca spp.), Texas prickly pear (Opuntia
Lindheimeri), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), and American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana).
Grasslands include seep mulhy (Muhlenbergia reverchnoii), Canadian wildrye (Elymus
canadensis), dichanthelium (Dichanthelium spp.), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), and
red grama (Bouteloua hirsuta). The project area is now primarily overgrown with juniper
and mixed oaks and grasses.

Hydrology
The project area is located within the Colorado River drainage basin, one of the
largest rivers in the state. The nearest major drainage to the project area is Adams Branch
and Pecan Bayou. Pecan Bayou drains to the south into the Colorado River.
Wildlife
The project area is located well within the Balconian Biotic Province, which is
characteristically represented by a general mixture of fauna from nearby surrounding
provinces (Blair 1950). Typical species found within the project area include White-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cotton-tailed rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), nine-banded
armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), black-tailed jack rabbit (Lepus californicus), raccoon
(Prycon lotor), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), wild turkey (Melagris gallopavo),
morning dove (Zenaida macroura), scissor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus), northern
bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), western coachwhip (Masticophis flagellum testaceus), and
the bullsnake (Pituophis melanoleucus sayi).
Vegetation
The vegetation of the Central Texas area has been described in detail by Tharp
(1939). The Texan Province (Blair 1950) has been geographically defined as the corridor
between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency regions, respectively, to the east and
west. Blair (1950) has described the vegetation groups of the Texan Biotic province in
considerable detail. The study area consists of cleared fields composed of grasslands and
weeds with some trees, including elm, juniper and mesquite, and shrubs immediately
adjacent to Williams Branch.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The project area is within the culture area known as the Central Texas
Archeological Region (Prewitt 1981). The chronology and all aspects of what we know
about the former inhabitants of this area were developed from information retrieved from
previous research efforts in the area and adjacent regions. There are four recognized
cultural periods in Central Texas: Paleo-Indian, Archaic (Early, Middle, and Late), Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. These periods are defined on the basis of changes that occurred
between each period and bear marked differences in technologies utilized, subsistence,
cultural manifestations, settlement patterns, and resource exploitation strategies. The
following is a brief synopsis of the four cultural periods.
Paleoindian Period
According to Willey and Phillips (1958:80), problems exist with the term
"Paleoindian," albeit widely accepted. Paleoindian typically refers to cultures oriented
towards big game hunting rather than gathering food for consumption. Eileen Johnson
(1977:65-77) states that it has been erroneously stereotyped as a âmigratory, systematic, big
game, procurement adaptation.â Collins (1995:381) argues that in Clovis times, for
example, Paleoindians exploited a diverse fauna base that not only included large
herbivores such as mammoth, bison, and horse but also smaller animals like water turtles,
land tortoises, alligator, mice, badgers, and raccoons. At Kincaid Rockshelter, a paved floor
suggests that the inhabitants of this site returned to it as part of a regular hunting and
gathering strategy in contrast with nomadic hunters who only pursued big game. It is,
therefore, assumed that an array of plants presumably constituted part of Clovis subsistence
(Collins 1990; Collins et al. 1989).
According to Skinner et al. (1981:13), the Paleoindian period is one of the least
understood time periods in Central Texas prehistory, primarily because few sites have been
excavated. As of 1985, for example, only two Paleoindian sites had been reported within
Bell County (Biesaart et al. 1985:125). Evidence of this period often occurs in the form
of surface collected materials found over much of Central Texas. At Fort Hood, this period
is represented by distinctive projectile points found in multi-component surface sites and
as isolated finds (Carlson et al. 1986:15). Generally, it is believed that this period lasted
from about 10,000 BC until 6000 BC Diagnostic artifacts of the period include the dart point
types; Angostura, Clovis, Folsom, Golondrina, and Plainview as defined by Suhm and
Jelks (1962), and Turner and Hester (1985).
These early sites often are found on old terraces of major river drainages and may be more
distant from major streams than more recent occupations (Bryan 1931). Some rockshelters,
such as the Levi site, were occupied intensively even though they are located a considerable
distance from major rivers. The only example of a rockshelter in Central Texas
immediately adjacent to a major drainage known to contain Paleoindian occupation is the
Horn Shelter (41BQ46) in Bosque County (Redder 1985). Also, Collins (1999) reported on
the Gault Site, a major Clovis site in Bell County, that is still being studied.

11

Archaic Period
The Archaic represents a broad cultural time period, which lasted from approximately
8500 Before Present (BP) to 1250 BP in Central Texas. According to Prewitt (1981:71),
"The Archaic Stage dominates all other remains in Central Texas." Prewitt (1981) has
subdivided the Archaic into eleven phases. LeRoy Johnson (1987) has questioned the
validity of the phase concept as used by Prewitt, especially the phases occurring before
the Middle Archaic. These have been grouped into Early, Middle, Late, and Terminal
periods by Carlson et al. (1986:15).
According to Prewitt (1981:77-78), during the Early Archaic there was a "strong
orientation toward the gathering aspect rather than the hunting, and a mobile population was
of low density." This occurred during the Circleville, San Geronimo, and Jarrell phases
(8500 BP - 5000 BP). In the Middle Archaic, food gathering had become very specialized
as evidenced by the presence of numerous burned rock middens/mounds (Prewitt 1981:7880). The Middle Archaic is seen by Prewitt to have taken place during the Oakalla, Clear
Fork, Marshall Ford, and Round Rock phases (5000 BP - 2600 BP). An overall decrease in
burned rock middens took place during the Late Archaic. Bison were important as a food
resource but did not dominate subsistence activities (Prewitt 1981:80-81). The Late
Archaic occurred during the San Marcos and Uvalde phases (2600 BP - 1750 BP). The
Terminal Archaic, according to the classification by Carlson et al. (1986), includes the
Twin Sisters and Driftwood phases (1750 BP - 1250 BP). An increase in the importance
of gathering and an apparent peak in site density seems to have occurred during Prewitt's
(1981:82) Driftwood phase.
Late Prehistoric Period
This period has been referred t o by some as the Neo-American Stage (Suhm et
al. 1954), Neo-archaic (Prewitt 1981), and Post-Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Technological changes are the primary distinguishing characteristics of this stage. The
Austin (1250 BP - 650 BP) and Toyah (650 BP - 200 BP) phases belong to this stage of
prehistory. During this time arrow points first appeared as well as ceramics and possibly
horticulture.
According to Collins (1995:385), there now is evidence that the bow and arrow
initially appeared in Central Texas. Pottery was added later and agriculture developed last
as it was of minor importance. Because Late Prehistoric groups continued to practice
hunting and gathering, a division or two sub-periods seem to have taken place. These are
referred to as Early and Late by Collins (1995:385) with a break between the long-standing
Archaic period and the Late Prehistoric period. This occurred circa 800 BP when Toyah
replaced Austin as the prevailing archeological manifestation.
The most obvious change that emerged at the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
period was the decreased use of the atlatl, or spear thrower, in favor of the bow and arrow.
Otherwise, subsistence lifestyles in the Late Prehistoric resembled those during the earlier
Archaic period (Prewitt 1981:74; Weir 1976). A chronological model by Dillehay (1974)
of bison presence and absence periods on the southern plains suggests that bison were
12

roaming during the Toyah phase but not during the preceding Austin phase.
Historic Period
Collins (1995:386) divides the Historic period of Central Texas into three subperiods: Early, Middle, and Late. During the first two, vestiges of both indigenous and
European peoples and cultures were present. However, in the third, the decline and
eventual decimation of the Aboriginal groups, along with the removal of the Apache and
Comanche to out-of-state reservation.
The early Historic sub-period in Central Texas began in the late 17th century when
Europeans first arrived. Brown County is situated within the historic range of the Tonkawa
Indians who inhabited the area in the 16th Century (Newcomb 1986). By the 19th Century,
they had broken ties with the Comanche and Wichita and were associated with the Lipan
Apache (Aten 1983:32). They have been described as typical southern Plains Indians who
were hunters and gatherers and who lived alongside the streams and rivers of Central
Texas.
During this period, Texas was occupied by numerous aboriginal groups including
the Caddo, Jumano, Tonkawa, Comanche, and Lipan Apache (Newcomb 1986). Trade was
known to have existed between the Jumano and Caddo. The Lipan Apache and
subsequently the Comanche entered the region from the Plains when following key animal
resources migrating into Texas. Contact period occupations are often identified by the
occurrence of glass beads, gun parts, gun flints, metal projectile points, and European
manufactured ceramics.
The archival search did not locate any Historic Indian sites in Brown County. In
nearby Coryell County, a blue glass bead was found with one of the burials at 41CV1, a
group burial along the Leon River (Jackson 1931), and a steel arrow point was reported as
an isolated find on Horse Creek in the extreme east corner of Coryell County (Campbell
1952).
About 1757 AD, the Spanish entered Central Texas and established a mission and a
presidio on the San Saba River in present Menard, Texas. The objective of this excursion
and brief occupation was to convert and pacify the Lipan Apache as well as locate reported
silver deposits. The mission was attacked and burned by a large force of Texas Indians and
abandoned in 1768 (Webb 1952). The area remained largely inhabited by Aboriginals,
(primarily Comanche and some Apache) until the mid-nineteenth century when the
collision with western Europeans became inevitable.
Brown County was organized in 1857 but formally created from parts of Comanche
and Travis Counties by an act of the State legislature in 1859. It was named for Capt.
Henry S. Brown, a Texas Revolution veteran.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Brown County has been investigated sporadically by both professional and
avocational archaeologists for the last few decades. In fact, there are more sites recorded in
this county than any surrounding counties, primarily as a result of many avocational
explorations. Of note, R. E. Forrester, E. B. Sayles and A. M. Woolsey recorded
prehistoric sites in the region in the 1920s and 1930s (unpublished notes on file, Texas
Archaeological Research Laboratory, TARL).
The Texas Archeological Society conducted the 1979 and 1980 field sessions in
Brown County about 7 miles northwest of Brownwood on the Bransford Eubank and
adjacent family ranches overlooking Pecan Bayou (TAS Newsletters; Vol. 24:1,2,3). A
variety of prehistoric sites, including camp sites (41BR107), burned rock middens
(41BR105 and 41BR110), ring middens (41BR9, 41BR104 and 41BR109), and historic
sites, which included a notched log cabin and a dugout with associated artifacts, were
recorded and excavated. A several mile long stretch along Pecan Bayou also was surveyed
that resulted in the recording of forty-nine additional sites in Brown County. In addition,
an early community store, Byrd's Store, circa 1860-1910 (41BR177) and a contiguous
road were located through local informants.
More recently Creel (1986) surveyed many different areas along the South Concho
River as part of his doctoral dissertation project. Espey Huston and Associates
(Wooldridge et al 1981) and Lintz et al. (1993) surveyed, tested, and excavated sites
throughout Owen H. Ivie Reservoir at the confluence of the Colorado and Concho
Rivers. Each has presented their own syntheses of the regional prehistory.
Closer to the project area, prehistoric sites 41BR30 and 41BR31 were recorded
along (and near) the unnamed intermittent north/south tributary of Adams Branch west of
the study area, while 41BR32 is located further to the southwest on the northern side of
Adams Branch. These sites include features such as burned rock middens (41BR30),
hearths and carbon stains as well as lithic and historic artifact scatters. Site 41BR30 is
located immediately south of the proposed clay grinding and mixing plant (tract 1) on
both sides of the Brownwood Water Supply Canal. It bears a series of middens west of
and parallel to the canal.
Other investigations in the area such as Bonine and Steely (2006) conducted an
oral hsitory project along with seven historic archaeological investigations at Camp
Bowie (41BR65, 266, 290, 299, 438, and 477). Bradle et al. (2000) conducted an
archaeological survey of a proposed clay mining area and building site very close to the
project area in the vicinity of Williams Creek but no sites were identified. Kegley (1979)
conducted a 3 mile linear survey along another water line route for the Brown County
Water Improvement District No.1. Subsequently, Kegley (1981) also surveyed a line
(along and near portions of the current project) and reported on sites 41BR30, 41BR302,
and 41BR303, which were recorded as lithic procurement and scatters.
Prikryl (1983) surveyed eighty-five acres for the Brownwood Sanitary Landfill
site and recorded 4 archaeological sites (41BR311, 41BR312, 41BR313, and 41BR314).
All four prehistoric sites contained chert tools, flakes, and burned rock fragments to an
14

average depth of 20 centimeters below the surface. Skinner (2003) surveyed 30 acres in
the City of Early to upgrade and expand a wastewater system by replacing existing
pipelines. Six archaeological sites were unearthed and recorded (41BR524, 41BR525,
41BR526, 41BR527, 41BR528, and 41BR29). Todd (2003) conducted an archaeological
survey of the Riverside Park Trails in Brownwood, Texas. No archaeological sites were
identified. Whitsett (1980) surveyed the Brownwood Water Treatment Plant expansion
and recorded site 41BR101. This location contained a few flakes, mussel shells, and bone
fragments.
Henderson (2000) conducted an archaeological survey of a number of proposed
water lines on behalf of the Texas Water Development Board to assist the Brown County
Water Improvement District No.1 to comply with state and federal regulations. One
portion of the line crossed over Adams Branch on the north side of Riverside Park.
Henderson (2000: 29-32) detailed the findings of two archaeological sites discovered
(41BR497 and 41BR498).
Site 41BR497 was recorded as an âaboriginal open campsiteâ in the floodplain of
Pecan Bayou located approximately 17 meters west of Adams Branch (Henderson
2000:30). This site was identified through the cultural materials discovered in Gradall
Trench 17 at a depth of 30 centimeters below the surface. There were additional shells
further down but without any concentration. Henderson (2000:30) further encountered a
âlarge fresh water shell accumulationâ at approximately 1.55 meters below the surface.
This mass was recorded as Feature 1 and it extended at a distance of approximately five
feet, being the width of the Gradall bucket. Henderson (2000:30) further noted that bone
fragments, flakes, charcoal, and burned rock were within the mussel shell accumulation.
Henderson (2000: 31-32) reported that site 41BR498 was found on the east side
of Adams Branch, which was based on the presence of cultural materials in three Gradall
trenches. Hearths, flint flakes, burned rock, a bifacial tool, and mussel shell fragments
were recovered. Henderson (2000:31) noted that the upper 30-40 centimeters of the site
appeared to be disturbed but it was reported that deeper deposits appeared to be intact.
Henderson (2000:31) indicated that a 40 x 40 centimeter burned rock hearth was
identified at approximately 75 centimeters below the surface, as well as scattered burned
rock at 57 centimeters below the surface. The horizontal and vertical extents of the site
were not determined. This location was identified on the basis of cultural materials
present in Gradall Trenches 21, 22, and 23 that were excavated during the Henderson
(2000) investigation. Henderson (2000:31) further indicated that the Gradall trenches
were excavated approximately 17 meters east of Adams Branch.

FIELD METHODS
Records Check
Prior to field investigations, the site files at TARL in Austin, Texas were checked
for previously recorded archaeological sites within and near the project area. In addition, a
search for other relevant archaeological contract reports was performed. Several
prehistoric sites were found, such as 41BR30, recorded in 1975 that consisted of a series of
burned rock middens on the west side of an unnamed minor drainage west of the
Brownwood Water Supply Canal. Two additional 1975 sites (41BR31 and 41BR32)
were noted along minor drainages further southwest of the project area. Henderson (2000)
reported on two other prehistoric sites located on Adams Branch (41BR497 and
41BR498), which are addressed in the Survey Methods and Results and Recommendations
sections of this report.
Additionally, AAG conducted historical archival research at the Brown County
Water Improvement District No.1 and located a number of historical photographs (figures
6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11) that provide insight into the various types of irrigation systems
constructed along with the magnitude of their impact. Based on these historical
photographs, it is apparent that these irrigation construction projects impact more area than
anticipated as well as the depth of impact.

Survey Methods
The field investigation included a full length, systematic pedestrian archaeological
survey of the proposed water line route. This was conducted by staff archaeologists from
AAG equipped with standard field equipment that included a shovel, a hand-held 1/4 inch
(6.3 mm) mesh screen, AAG shovel test forms, site forms, a compass, USGS topographic
maps depicting the project area, cameras, artifact bags, and inventory sheets.
Backhoe trenches were excavated to sterile substrate soils (or at least 2 meters),
whichever occurred first. All backhoe trench data were recorded onto the backhoe trench
log (Appendix I). Eighty (80) trenches were excavated and the backdirt piles were
inspected along the water line route. A shovel test column was excavated in the wall
and screened to locate any further buried cultural deposits in accordance to state
standards.
Unfortunately, most of the project area was disturbed through previous
extensive clearing and agricultural activities, urban disturbances, and existing rights-of
âway. However, AAG made a thorough effort to examine subsurface deposits in the
project area through backhoe trenching. Figures 1-5 depict the approximate location
of the eighty (80) backhoe trenches. Very few backhoe trenches were excavated on the
western end of the water lineâs route due to its path through an existing right-of-way
zone that had been heavily impacted. It also contained spoil piles deeper than the impacts
of the proposed water line. No artifacts were collected for curation.

20

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The pre-field study revealed two previously recorded sites in the immediate project
area (41BR497 and 41BR498) as recorded and reported on by Henderson (2000:29-33).
Overall, the parts of the project area had been impacted by being located in an urban
setting, as well as falling within existing rights-of-way zones with old railroad grade
construction, erosion, having past waterline maintenance and repairs, and experiencing
past archaeological investigations. Figures 12-16 provide examples of these impacts.
Four archaeological sites were encountered during the AAG investigation. The
previously recorded sites (41BR497 and 41BR498) were recorded by Henderson (2000)
and relocated by AAG. The newly recorded sites (41BR584 and 41BR585) were identified
and recorded by AAG.

purposes. Note the amount of fill piled to the right.

41BR497
AAG conducted backhoe trenching operations across the flood plain adjacent to
Adams Branch and only identified cultural materials in Backhoe Trench 54 (Figure 4). It is
worth noting that Henderson (2000:30) indicated that the site component âcontaining F-1
appeared to be well below the plow zone and did not appear to have been impacted by
agricultural activities.â However, the AAG project found cultural materials in BHT- 54 at
32 centimeters below the surface. This side of Adams Branch has been subjected to a
number of impacts such as plowing, livestock grazing, erosion, irrigation line construction
and repairs. Figure 17 shows continuously leaking water that prevents any subsurface
testing.

Figure 17. Northeastern view of area where site 41BR497 is located.
As noted above, site 41BR497 is located in an area approximately 50 feet from
Adams Branch (Appendix IIb). AAG could not excavate on line directly but it is in close
proximity to where Henderson (2000) had conducted investigations. BHT-54 was
excavated approximately 50 feet southeast of the line. This was done to assist in
delineating areal extents of the site and possibly to identify an alternate route, thereby
avoiding this site. However, BHT-54 was positive and fresh water mussel shell was found
in close proximity to a burned rock at 32 centimeters below the surface (Figure 18). The
mussel shell was collected for radiometric dating. Beta Analytic, Inc. conducted
radiocarbon dating on the sample submitted. The results yielded a Conventional
24

Radiocarbon date of 2,460 +/- 30 B.P., thus indicating cultural deposits dating to Late
Archaic in age.
No further excavation was completed at BHT-54 as it appeared to contain a burned
rock surface and intact cultural deposits. AAG did not want to disturb any additional
features.Notably, Henderson (2000:30) identified cultural materials at 30, 41, 55, 73, 90,
120, and 155 centimeters below the surface. The presence of cultural materials at 30
centimeters is consistent with what AAG identified in BHT-54. However, it is interesting
to also note that approximately 50-70 centimeters of soil deposits are missing. Itâs
apparent from the exposed roots of nearby trees (Figure 19).
Due to the large leak along the existing pipeline and the presence of subsurface
features with intact cultural deposits, AAG could not test the very same area that Henderson
(2000) had investigated. However, we believe this site should be avoided through a deep
(minimum 12 feet in depth) boring operation or an alternative route across the Adams
Branch floodplain chosen for further study.
BHT-53 was located slightly higher in elevation than BHT-54 within the vast
floodplain of Adams Branch. No cultural material was identified. This site appears to
have been elongated and sits astride the western side of Adams Branch.

Figure 18. View of BHT-54 (site 41BR497); note the presence of burned rock.

41BR498
AAG conducted backhoe trenching operations across the floodplain on the east
side of Adams Branch and identified subsurface cultural deposits in Backhoe Trenches 51
and 52 (Figure 4; Appendix IIb). Henderson (2000:31-32) identified site 41BR498 as
being in close proximity to BHT-51 (AAG). Since the planned route for pipeline
excavation was planned through this area, AAG excavated BHT-49, 50, and 52 in an
effort to avoid this site. All results were negative.
Henderson (2000:31-32) made three Gradall trenches within this site and
identified flakes, burned rock, two hearths, a bifacial tool, and mussel shell. She also
identified cultural materials at 57 and 75 centimeters below the surface. Henderson (2000:
31) identified the upper 40 centimeters as having been disturbed. AAG noted the same
disturbances as well as a number of gravel deposits on the surface related to repairs and
subsequent work on the existing water line (Figure 20).
AAG indentified cultural materials for this site in two backhoe trenches (BHT-51
and BHT-52). BHT -51 was excavated to a depth of 2.05 meters into a silty clay loam
with calcium carbonates present. One loose burned rock fragment was found at 47
centimeters below the surface. This trench appears to contain mixed clay deposits and
probably is the locality of Hendersonâs (2000) investigation of her Gradall Trenches 2123 (Figure 21).
26

BHT-52 was excavated 50 feet south in an effort to delineate the areal extent of
this site. Cultural materials were identified. Fresh water mussel shell was recovered in-situ
at 58 centimeters below the surface, collected, and submitted for radiometric dating
(Figures 22 and 23). Beta Analytic, Inc. conducted radiocarbon dating on the sample
submitted. The results yielded a Conventional Radiocarbon date of 3,970 +/- 40 B.P.
(Appendix III), thus indicating that the cultural deposits date to the end of the Early
Archaic into Middle Archaic in age.
Site 41BR498 is an equal distance from Adams Branch as Henderson (2000:31)
noted. AAG believes that this site definitely is located along a buried natural levee that
is noticeable among the trees in Figure 24. Previous pipeline construction bladed down
the levee in the vicinity where Henderson (2000) conducted her investigations. Natural
levees were occupied routinely by local prehistoric inhabitants of Central Texas.

and subsequent work on the existing waterline.

Both 41BR497 and 41BR498 are potentially eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places and potentially worthy of designation as a State Archeological
Landmark. AAG recommended to the City of Early and Zephyr Water Supply
Corporation, as well as its engineers, Jacob and Martin Ltd., to avoid these two sites and
their subsurface cultural deposits. Further discussions with Mr. Kit Harle, P.E. of Jacob
and Martin, Ltd. resulted in a plan to bore under both sites for avoidance.
AAG recommends that boring operations commence between BHT-48 and BHT-49
and bore a minimum of 12 feet below the surface (beneath any intact soil horizons and
under the creek bottom grade) and terminate the boring between BHT-78 and BHT-79
(Appendix IIb). This approach will preserve both sites and not require a Phase II testing
program.
41BR584 was encountered on a sloping field approximately 150 meters west of
Williams Branch, being a tributary to Pecan Bayou. This site was recorded as a low rise
burned rock mound (figures 25 and 26) approximately 25 x 25 meters in size. In
addition to the noticeable mounded area, it appears to be approximately one half
meter above the surrounding ground elevation. Only burned sandstone rocks were
observed. No artifacts or flakes were seen on the surface. AAG shifted the line route
approximately 60 feet to the northeast in order to avoid this site. Backhoe Trenches 60,
61, and 62 did not produce any artifacts or any subsurface cultural materials (Appendix
IIc).

Figure 25. Southwestern view of site 41BR584, a low rise burned rock mound.
30

Since 41BR584 was avoided with a minor alignment shift, no further work is
recommended. However, any future impacts that could come in close proximity to the
mound site should be mitigated through a testing program that focuses on site structure,
chronological age, and regional subsistence. This site potentially is eligible for inclusion
on the National Register of Historic Places and potentially worthy of designation as a State
Archeological Landmark.

Figure 26. The Southern view of site 41BR584. Note the burned rock mound that slopes
up on the right. The proposed alignment was shifted 60 feet to the northeast to avoid this
site.
41BR585 was recorded in a plowed field on the basis of surficial presence of a low
density of flakes and a few cores (Figure 27). The site appears to be fairly deflated because
of erosion, irrigation, and cultivation. This site also was recorded solely as a surface
locality (Appendix IIa). No cultural materials were encountered in Backhoe Trenches 58,
74, 75, or 76. The edge of this site appears within the current project, but the majority of it
is most likely to the south. The northern boundary is bounded by the old railroad tram.
Since this site contains no apparent subsurface deposits, no features, or significant artifacts
assemblage, 41BR585 is not considered eligible for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) nor worthy of designation as a State Archeological Landmark
(SAL).

31

Figure 27. Southwestern view of site 41BR585.
On the basis of these recorded results from the cultural resource surface survey and
backhoe testing of the proposed City of Early-Zephyr Water Supply Corporation
Waterline, AAG recommends that the project (as currently proposed) will not effect
significant cultural resources in the area. There will be no effect to any of the intact
subsurface cultural deposits. None of the previous irrigation canal features will be
impacted since they have been removed or filled-in.
The project alignment was done to avoid these buried features. The area between
BHT-69 and BHT-70 parallels an existing lateral irrigation line that should not be
impacted as the line will be placed between the irrigation ditch and the fenceline.
Additionally, the proposed line also would bore under any irrigation canals in order to
avoid any impacts. Therefore, it is recommended that the Archeology Division, Texas
Historical Commission concur with this recommendation with the stipulation that if
cultural resources are encountered during construction, then all work in the immediate
area must cease until the situation can be evaluated by American Archaeology Group
LLC in consultation with the Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission and
representatives of the City of Early and Zephyr Water Supply Corporation.
