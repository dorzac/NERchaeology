I would like to thank Ann M. Early, Lois E. Albert, Jeffrey S. Girard, Robert L.
Brooks, Scott W. Hammerstedt, Shawn Marceaux, Duncan McKinnon, Robert Z. Selden,
Jr., Mary Beth Trubitt, and Mark Walters for their help with previous compilations of the
Caddo bibliography. As part of their peer reviews of the final draft, Chris Lintz, Juliana
Barr, and John Samuelsen also provided useful suggestions and bibliographic additions.

INTRODUCTION
Timothy K. Perttula
This Bibliography is the latest and most comprehensive version of
published sources concerning the archeology, bioarcheology, ethnography,
ethnography, and history of the Caddo Indian peoples of the Trans-Mississippi
South. Two early editions were published by the Arkansas Archeological Survey
(Perttula et al. 1999, 2006), while a third edition (Perttula et al. 2011) was posted
on the Caddo Conference Organization (www.caddoconference.org) website. A
fourth edition was published by the Friends of Northeast Texas Archaeology
(Perttula et al. 2013). It is my hope that this latest version of the bibliography will
continue to be a useful reference work for people conducting research on, and/or
are interested in, Caddo native history and culture.
This version of the bibliography contains over 5000 references whose
subject matter in some manner is about the Caddo Indian peoples, an aboriginal
people that lived in southwest Arkansas, northwest Louisiana, eastern
Oklahoma, and eastern Texas (Figure 1) from as early as the Woodland period
(ca. 500 B.C. to A.D. 800) to the present-day. References concerning older
cultures that inhabited the area—Archaic and Paleoindian cultures—are not
included in the bibliography. Their traditional homelands, centering on the Red
River in the Great Bend area, covered approximately 200,000 km2.
The bibliography is organized into three major sections: (1) Caddo Archeology
and Bioarcheology; (2) Caddo Ethnohistory & Ethnography; and (3) Caddo
History.
I intend the Caddo bibliography to include references to all works that
address Caddo research questions and topics and/or provide information that will
be useful to people involved in Caddo research in this region, and it is current as
of June 2014. These include cultural resources management (CRM) reports of
limited distribution, journal articles, books, and other published or formally
completed documents, as well as important unpublished references. I have tried
to select references that have substantive information on the archeology and
history of the Caddo or their Woodland period ancestors within the boundaries of
the Caddo area. It is planned that this Bibliography will be regularly updated and
posted online on the Journal of Texas Archeology and History website.

and northern areas.

With the updating of this bibliography on a regular basis in a digital format,
I would appreciate receiving submissions of new references from colleagues and
people interested in the archeology and history of the Caddo Indian peoples, as
well as mention of any older references that were inadvertently omitted from the
present edition. These references should be submitted to:
