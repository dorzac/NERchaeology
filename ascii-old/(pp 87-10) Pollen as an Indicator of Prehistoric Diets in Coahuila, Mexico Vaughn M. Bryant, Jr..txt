POLLEN AS AN INDICATOR OF PREHISTORIC DIETS
IN COAHUILA, MEXICO
VAUGHN M.

BRYANT, JR.

ABSTRACT
This paper reports information derived from the pollen analysis of 47
human coproHte specimens recovered during the excavation of Frightful
Cave, Coahnila, Mexico. The age of the coprolites range from approximately 7.500 B. C, to A.D. 300 and are grouped into three major
categories based upon their provenience in the site. The data from these 47
human coprolites are used to: (1) reconstruct prehistoric diet patterns, (2)
predict specific periods of site occupancy, and (3) distinguish between
economic and background pollen types. In addition, the coprolitic data are
used for making limited generalizations concerning possible vegetational
changes in the Frightful Cave area during the past 9.500 years.

INTRODUCTION
Human coprolites recovered during the archeological excavation of
Frightful Cave were sent to Dr, Gary F. Fry of Youngstown State
University who conducted an analysis of the macrofossil contents.
Small subsamples (ca. 1-2cc) of each of the 47 human coprolites were
extracted by Fry and sent to the Texas A&M Anthropology Research
Laboratory where I processed and analyzed them for their pollen contents.
Each of the samples was reconstituted into a moist state using the
trisodium phosphate method developed by Callen and Cameron
(1960). Standard 200 grain pollen counts were attempted for each
sample as first suggested by Barkley (1934). In 26 of the samples it
was possible to obtain counts of between 200-300 pollen grains. Of the
remaining 21 samples all but seven contained between 100-200 pollen
grains, Of the total 47 samples only seven contained fewer than 100
grains or were totally void of pollen. The tabulation for each of the 40
samples containing more than 100 pollen grains is shown in Figure 1.
The human coprolites from Frightful Cave are organized into three
distinct categories based upon their provenience within the site.
Associated material from each category has been radiocarbon dated
(Stuckenrath n.d.}. The coprolites recovered from the lower strata of
the site are lumped into the category called "lower" and consist of 15
human coprolites that range in age from 7,500-5,000 B, C. The "middle" category contains 16 human coprolites recovered from strata
which have been dated between 5,000-2,000 B, C. The last of these
three categories is termed "upper" and consists of 16 human
coprolites recovered from strata dated from 2,000 B. C.-A. D. 300.

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
ANALYSIS

The pollen types recovered from these human coprolite specimens
are grouped into three distinct categories: {1} economic pollen, (2)
background pollen and {3) pollen that could have resulted from either
economic or background sources which I have termed "special
economic pollen types".
Economic pollen was found in almost all of the human coprolite
specimens examined from Frightful Cave. In many cases these pollen
types are represented by high percentages which suggest the intentional eating of flowers and/or pollen for its flavor, food value, or
suspected medicinal effects. Some might argue that such high
economic pollen counts could have been ingested as part of the normal pollen rain that settles on foods later eaten by man, or from the
eating of non-floral plant foods such as leaves, stems or fruits. These
alternatives have been investigated (Bryant 1969} and found to be
highly improbable. Likewise, I have found (Bryant 1969} that in certain regions local drinking water sources and normal pollen rain are
unlikely to account for the ingestion of more than approximately 2%
of any specific economic pollen type. The only exception would be
"special economic pollen types" which are from wind pollinated
plants such as those from certain species of composites and taxa in
the category termed "Cheno-Am".
In reviewing the data found in the coprolite specimens from Frightful Cave I shall consider the presence of any economic pollen type in a
quantity of 10% or greater to represent the direct ingestion of that
specific plant’s flowers and/or its pollen. A lower level of 2-3%
economic pollen could have been used instead of the 10% level in
view of past studies of human coprolites from the Amistad region
(Bryant 1974a}. However, while the presence of economic pollen in
percentages of more than 10% is interpreted to reflect the eating of
flowers and/or pollen, low percentages below 10% may not always
represent the direct ingestion of a specific plant’s flowers due to the
possibility of interflower contamination by insects. Therefore, if a
coprolite specimen contained 10% cactus pollen and 2% agave
pollen, for example, I would interpret the data to reflect the eating of
cactus flowers. On the other hand, while the 2% agave pollen in that
same coprolite may also reflect the additional eating of agave
flowers, it is also possible that such a marginal percentage of
economic pollen could have resulted from the interflower insect contamination of the cactus flower with a few agave pollen grains.
Special economic pollen types are different from economic types
since their pollen could be ingested as part of the food or by accident.

PREHISTORIC DIETARY ANALYSIS

91

Plants in this category produce large numbers of pollen grains which
become airborne and float in the wind currents until they drop to the
ground as one of the abundant contributors to the local pollen rain.
Thus. during the summer flowering season a person could ingest a
number of special economic pollen grains by a variety of methods
other than direct flower eating. This could include special economic
pollen types such as Cheno-Am, low-spine Compositae, and high-spine
Compositae, trapped in the mucus of the nose and lungs which is later
swallowed, pollen drunk as part of local drinking water sources, and
pollen that settles on foods about to be eaten. However, unless either
the seeds or the flowers of these types were being eaten one would
not expect to find pollen percentages of this type in excess of approximately 40% (Bryant 1974a).
There are a number of pollen types found in the Frightful Cave
coprolites which do not appear to have resulted from the direct eating
of certain plant foods and they are termed "background" pollen
types. Thus, these types tend to reflect pollen types found in the normal pollen rain of northern Mexico. Even th ough these background
types do not reflect any ethnobotanical significance in the Frightful
Cave coprolites the reader should not assume that these types are
always to be considered as background species. Typha and Ephedra,
for example, are classified as background types in this study yet in
other studies (Napton and Kelso 1969; Riskind 1970] one, or both of
these pollen types have been shown to reflect prehistoric man’s
dietary patterns.
Some of the background pollen types found in the Frightful Cave
coprolites are useful as indicators of probable seasonality of site
usage and they will be discussed later in this report. Other
background types, however, are useful only as indicators of plants
which at one time composed part of the local vegetation in the vicinity
of Frightful Cave.
The background pollen types fall into two broad categories: (I)
anemophilous -- those that are produced in large numbers and are
from plants which rely upon the wind to disperse their pollen, and (2)
zoophilous -- those that are produced in lesser quantities and are
from plants which rely upon insects to disperse their pollen.
Lower Level -- (7,500-5,000 B. C.)
During the early period of site occupation (7,500-5,000 B. C.) the
dominate economic pollen types found in the recovered human
coprolites consisted of Opuntia, Leucaena, and Umbelliferae. In addition large quantities of special economic pollen types such as

92

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Cheno-Am and low-spine Compositae were recovered from coprolites
dating from the early period of site occupation.
The pricklypear cactus (Opuntia) has a large, heavy grain which is
not suited to airborne travel and thus would not be a common component of any normal pollen rain fallout. Individual flowers in this
group of cacti produce a large number of anthers and pollen grains so
that the eating of even one flower would incorporate hundreds or
even thousands of pollen grains into a single fecal sample. In looking
at the pollen data from these human coprolites (Fig. 2) it is evident
that pricklypear cactus flowers were one of the more frequent food
choices during the early time period of site occupation.
Cactus flower eating is not unique to the Frightful Cave area.
Palmer (1878) noted that California Indians often ate freshly picked
pricklypear cactus flowers and used others ta flavor a type of fermented drink. In a similar study of the Pima, Castetter and Bell {1942}
reported that cactus flowers were an important diet item and were
ranked second only to mesquite in importance of gathered wild plant
foods. Previous studies of prehistoric human coprolites also note the
use of cactus flowers as food. Martin and Sharrock (1964) found high
percentages of cactus pollen in human coprolite samples recovered
from Basketmaker and Pueblo period sites in the Glen Canyon region
of Utah. I (Bryant 1974a) also found that cactus flowers seem to have
represented an important diet item for the Late Archaic inhabitants
of the Amistad Reservoir area located to the north of Frightful Cave.
In reference to the frequency of use (Fig. 2) it appears that
pricklypear flowers were eaten far more often at Frightful Cave
during the earlier period (7,500-5,000 B. C.) of site occupation than
during the later period after 5,000 B. C. This change in diet seems to
have been due to some unknown cultural change in dietary preference rather than to a loss of cactus availability in the local environment. The macrofossil plant remains recovered from these
same human coprolites showed no similar decrease in the eating of
cactus pads and cactus fruit after 5,000 B.C.
The occurrence of leadtree (Leucaena) pollen in the human
coprolites from Frightful Cave is most common in samples from the

eaten. In other instances, such as in sample 38 from the early period
of site occupation where leadtree pollen is present in a percentage
greater than 40%
it is obvious that the leadtree flowers were
actually eaten.
Umbelliferae plants have long been associated with man and today
many of our modern spices and herbs come from plants of this group.
In North America many different species of Umbelliferae were eaten
as food by aboriginal groups. Ethnographic records reveal that the
tubers were cooked or eaten raw (Spinden 1908), the leaves were
made into salads (Chamberlin 1911), the seeds were ground and eaten
(Harvard 1895), and the flowers were boiled to make tea (Brown
1868). The pollen grains from the many taxa in this plant family are
similar in shape and morphology and therefore difficult to separate
beyond the family level. Umbelliferae pollen was not common in these
coprolite samples, yet in one sample (sample 26) from the early period
of site occupation 90% of the total pollen was from some unidentified
member of the Umbelliferae plant family. In order to reach such a
high percentage of Umbelliferae pollen a person would have had to
eat individual flowers, drink the pollen as part of a beverage (tea) or
eat the leaves and flowers as part of a salad. Only in this one sample
from the lower occupational period (7,500-5,000 B. C.) of Frightful
Cave did the pollen record indicate the obvious use of some type of
Umbelliferae flowers as food. In the other coprolite samples where
Umbelliferae pollen is present it occurs in such low percentages that
it could be considered as a possible interflower or background contaminant.
A number of plants belonging to the Chenopodiaceae plant family
and to the plant genus of Amaranthus are known to have been used
throughout many areas of the American Southwest and Northern
Mexico (Barrows 1900; Castetter 1935; Elmore 1943; and Fewkes
1896). Collectively these plants are termed "Cheno-Am" by pollen
analysts (Martin 1963) since it is almost impossible to distinguish the
pollen types of this group from one another with the use of the light
microscope. Suspected use of these plants as food by the prehistoric
inhabitants of Frightful Cave is revealed in the pollen analysis of the
coprolites. Those pollen data revealed the highest percentages of
Cheno-Am pollen in coprolites dating from the earliest periods of site
occupation (Fig. I). Ilowever, the percentages of Cheno-Am pollen
found in the Frightful Cave coprolites dating from occupation periods
after 5,000 B. C. are 10w and suggest that they may have resulted
from sources such as the normal pollen rain which undoubtedly settled on prepared foods about to be eaten.
There are several justifications for using high percentages of
Cheno-Am pollen as indicators for prehistoric diet preferences of

PREHISTORIC DIETARY ANALYSIS

95

these plants. Unlike most of the other economic pollen types, high percentages of Cheno-Am pollen in human coprolites could result from
eating the seeds, eating the leaves, or eating the flowers. A plant’s
pollen does not often become mixed with its seeds yet among taxa of
the Cheno-Am this does result. Among many species of the Cheno-Am
group individual plants flower continuously over a number of weeks
and even months. As a result, when the earliest flowers turn to
mature seeds other flowers on the same plant are still in their
pollination stage, Thus during the collection and winnowing of ChenoAm seeds using aboriginal methods pollen from maturing flowers
near the top of the plants can become incorporated with the mature
seeds gathered from the lower portion of the plants. In addition,
Bryant and Larson (1968) found in the Amistad Reservoir area of
Texas large quantities of goosefoot seeds (Chenopodium)in the same
human coprolites that contained high percentages of Cheno-Am
pollen. Martin and Sharrock (1964) report similar results in their
study of human coprolites from the Glen Canyon area of Utah. ..................
Individual plant types within the family Compositae can be divided
into several categories based upon differences in their pollen morphology, One of these groups is termed "low-spine" and includes
those composite genera with pollen types having surface spines
shorter than two microns in height. The pollen in this low-spine
composite group is anemophilous (wind-pollinated) and is thus produced in great numbers and dispersed by the wind (ragweed is one
of the better known members of this composite group). These attributes make low-spine composite pollen one of the more common
background types found in normal pollen rains. Thus, considerable
amounts of low-spine pollen up to about 40°/o could be expected to
be inadvertently swallowed or eaten along with other foods and
would not reflect utilization of these composite plants as food. Most
of the low-spine pollen in the human coprolites from Frightful Cave
undoubtedly falls into this category. However, in one coprolite
sample (number 35) dating from the lower period of site occupation
low-spine composite pollen was recovered in a percentage greater
than 55% and thus strongly suggests more than iust an accidental
ingestion of this pollen type. !n that sample the high percentage of
low-spine pollen suggests the direct eating of composite plants,
their seeds, and/or their flowers. A similar situation was reported
in the Mammoth Cave area of Kentucky (Bryant 1975b) where large
numbers of Ira (marsh-elder) seeds were found in the same human
coprolite samples containing more than 50% low-spine composite
pollen.

96

Middle Level -- (5,000-2,000 B. C.)
The coprolitic pollen records suggest that diet patterns during the
middle period of site occupation differed from those of the earlier
period. Opuntia, Leucaena, and Umbelliferae were important during
the earlier period yet are replaced in importance during the middle
period by Acacia, Agave, and Solanum.
The pollen evidence suggesting the use of acacia as food is not
strongly represented in the coprolitic record from any period of site
occupation at Frightful Cave. Acacia pollen was found in only eight
samples and reaches a significant level of more than a few percent in
only one sample (Sample 43) which dates from the middle time period
(5,000-2,000 B. C.) of site occupation. The 12% acacia pollen in that
single sample may reflect the eating of acacia flowers, or the drinking
of acacia tea. The practice of acacia flower eating by the early
inhabitants of Frightful Cave admittedly is weak yet it does seem to
exist, since one would not normally ingest more than about 2% acacia
pollen from background sources (Bryant 1969).
Agave plants are a common component of many arid and semi-arid
environments in the American Southwest and Northern Mexico.
Ethnographic and ethnobotanical studies have demonstrated that
these plants were utilized for making fermented liquor, used as food,
and sought for their fibers. Palmer (1878) has also noted that in
California. for example, the flowers were collected and eaten for
their flavor and nectar contents. Approximately two hundred miles
north of Frightful Cave in the Amistad Reservoir area of southwest
Texas agave flowers were a common item in the prehistoric diet
(Bryant 1974a). The coprolitic pollen evidence suggests that at Frightful Cave agave flowers were also one of the more important flower
foods in prehistoric man’s diet and reached their height of utilization
during the middle occupation period. This apparent trend may reflect
the increased availability of agave plants or a change in diet
preference during the middle time period.
Nightshade (Solanum) pollen is present in only a few of the
coprolite samples from Frightful Cave. Known aboriginal dietic uses
of nightshades are centered mostly upon the eating of the tubers or
leaves (Sparkman 1908; Castetter 1935) and no mention is made of the
flowers being specifically sought as food sources. In spite of this lack
of ethnographic evidence it is still possible that nightshade flowers
were individually picked and eaten. The high percentages of nightshade pollen in samples 1 and 3 represent ingestion of the flowers
either directly, or indirectly as part of a salad. Nightshade pollen is
missing from the early period coprolite samples and is present in only
a few of the middle and later period coprolites. The highest frequency

PREHISTORIC DIETARY ANALYSIS

97

of occurrence, however, is linked to the middle period of site occupation.
Upper Level -- (2,000 B, C.-A, D, 300)
During the last major period of site occupation several new
economic pollen types dominate the human coprolite samples. Dalea,
Dasylirion, Portulaca and Unknown type A pollen were found in the
coprolites during the earliest two occupational periods yet did not
become dominate types until the final period of site occupation after
2,000 B. C. One of the special economic pollen types (high-spine composite} was also a common type found in most coprolites but assumes
importance as a diet indicator only during the upper period of site occupation ....
Dalea is a legume that is commonly found in many areas of the semiarid and arid Southwest and is a plant that would have been available
for utilization by the prehistoric inhabitants of Frightful Cave. Dalea
pollen is present in more than one-half of all the human coprolites
from Frightful Cave that contained sufficient pollen for analysis and
indicates a steady increase in use from early through late occupation
periods of the site. In many of the coprolite samples dalea pollen occurs in low percentages which may reflect a minimal utilization of
this flower as food. However, dalea pollen production per individual
flower is low, thus proportionately one would have to eat a number of
dalea flowers before its pollen would be found in abundant quantities
in a coprolite.
Sotol plants, like agave, produce conspicious flowers which are
easy to harvest. In the Amistad Reservoir area of southwest Texas
sotol flowers were an important part of Late Archaic peoples diet. In
that region I found that sotol pollen sometimes reached percentage
levels greater than 60% in human coprolite samples (Bryant 1974a).
In the Frightful Cave human coprolite samples, however, sotol pollen
is restricted to very low counts even though it is slightly more
frequent in the human coprolites from the final period of site occupation. In spite of its slight increase in certain site occupational
levels it is still suspected that most, or all, of the sotol pollen found in
the Frightful Cave coprolites may have resulted from sources other
than the direct eating of sotol flowers. This assumption is further
strengthened by the fact that there is a 81% correlation between the
presence of both sotol and agave pollen in the same coprolite samples.
Since these two liliaceous plants are found in similar habitats, have
similar flowering periods, and are pollinated by many of the same insect species it is probable that when the prehistoric people ate the
flowers of either plant they mght also have ingested a few pollen

grains of the other taxa. In any case, sotol flowers were not nearly as
important a diet item in the Frightful Cave area as they were in an
almost identical habitat 200 miles to the north in the Amistad region.
Purslane (Portulaca) pollen was found in only six of the human
coprolite samples from Frightful Cave. The low percentage of purslane pollen in most of those six samples may have resulted from interflower insect contamination, yet in one sample (sample 41) dating from
the upper period of site occupation the occurence of 60°/o purslane pollen probably resulted from the direct eating of the actual
flowers. The flowers may have been picked and eaten individually or
could have become accidently incorporated during the preparation of
a purslane leaf salad. Ethnographic sources do not mention the
specific use of purslane flowers as food yet both Rusby (1906) and
Elmore (1943) state that fresh purslane leaf salads were eaten by Indian groups living in the arid Southwestern United States. Other
evidence of its prehistoric use was found in human coprolite samples
recovered from Pueblo I and Pueblo Ill levels an Antelope House,
Arizona (Williams-Dean and Bryant 1975). As seen in Figures i and 2
the utilization of purslane as food is apparently restricted to the upper period of site occupation at Frightful Cave. Such limited usage
could have been cultural or may instead reflect an increased
availability of this plant in the local flora.
Unknown pollen type A is classified as an economic type because
the pollen grain morphology suggests that the parent plant was a type
that requires insect pollination. As such its pollen would not be expected to be found as part of the normal pollen rain of the region and
thus it could only have become incorporated into the coprolite as the
result of flower eating. There are no obvious clues as to which plant il
may rep resent except that its morphology compares favorably with
other pollen types of the family Leguminosae. A picture of this pollen
grain is included in Figure 3 in hopes that someone may recognize it.
Unknown pollen type A was recovered in coprolites dating from the
middle and upper periods of site occupation yet the highest concentration seems to have occurred during the upper time period.
The high-spine group of composites includes a number of taxa of
similar morpholopy all of which have pollen grains with surface
spines longer than two microns. Plants in this group produce pollen
that is dispersed by insects and therefore its pollen is usually weakly
represented in the normal pollen rain. Although this pollen type is
found in many of the Frightful Cave coprolite samples it reaches
significant percentages of over 45% mainly in coprolites dating from
the upper period of site occupation. In those instances of high pollen

percentages the most probable conclusion is to assume that it
resulted from the eating of high-spine composite flowers and/or
seeds. This assumption is further strengthened by the coprolite
macrofossil data which reveal that Helianthus (sunflower) seeds
were found in coprolite samples 4, 11, 36, and 42 from the upper occupation period which also contained high-spine composite pollen
percentages over 45%. I have also found similar correlations (Bryant
1974b) in human coprolites from Mammoth Cave where there was a
100% correlation between the presence of Helianthus seeds and highspine composite pollen in the same samples.
Unlike some seed-bearing plants, members of the high-spine composite group produce seed clusters in the form of "heads" which
allows for their easy harvest. Among the Apache, for example, sunflower seeds were regularly harvested late each fall by the women of
the tribe (Castetter and Opler 1936). The usual harvest technique employed by the Apaches was to place a basket underneath the sunflower head and then strike the back of the head sharply knocking the
seeds into the basket. Later, the seeds were ground into flour, made
into a dough, and then baked on hot stones or in hot ashes. Experiments conducted in our laboratory at Texas A&M University have
shown that the above method of sunflower seed collection will result
in the incorporation of sunflower pollen into the ground flour. This occurs because some of the sunflower pollen becomes trapped in among
the seeds and is then inadvertently collected in the basket and later
ground into flour along with the seeds-In this manner it is possible,
and even probable, that high-spine compositae pollen could eventually become part of a human fecal specimen.

SEASONALITY
It has been shown (de Lumley 1969; Bryant 1974a, 1974b) that the
pollen contents of prehistoric human coprolites can be used to
provide valuable clues as to the probable seasonality of site occupation. There are several ways in which this can be done. In human
coprolite samples where there is little background pollen and much
zoophilous economic pollen it is possible to suggest seasonality. It is
also possible to suggest seasonality when large percentages of
specific types of background pollen are present in coprolite samples.
(3n the other hand, weak representations of certain background types
or the total absence of pollen in human coprolite samples are not
useful clues as to probable seasonality.
Certain indications as to the probable seasonality of site occupation can be determined from the Frightful Cave coprolitic pollen

PREHISTORIC DIETARY ANALYSIS

101

data. However, in most cases when the determination of seasonality
is based upon high percentages of economic pollen types the assumption is made that the pollen was ingested during the season when the
plant was in flower. For example, in samples where large quantities
of cactus pollen are present (samples 38, 40 and 44) I assume that it
reflects the eating of fresh cactus flowers rather than the eating of
dried cactus flowers during a later season of the year. This assumption is based upon several factors: (i) most ethnographic sources
already cited report that when flowers were eaten they were
generally eaten fresh, and (2) many subsistence level hunting and
gathering societies did not, as a general rule, store dried foods for
later use.
Lower Occupational Period -- Coprolitic data from the lower occupational period (7,500-5,000 B. C.) at Frightful Cave reflect a
dominant summer and fall seasonality of site usage. In addition there
are four coprolite samples for which probable seasonality can not be
assigned.
Five of the coprolite specimens (sample 10, 38, 40, 44, 45) from this
time period reflect definite late spring or summer seasonality. In each
of these five coprolite specimens Opuntia is one of the dominant
represented pollen types and probably resulted from the direct
ingestion of fresh cactus flowers during the late spring and/or summer pollination period of those plants. The assignment of seasonality
for these five coprolites is also strengthened by the presence of other
zoophilous pollen types such as Agave, Dalea, and Leucaena.
Three of the other coprolites from this lower occupational period
(samples 26, 32, 35) contain data suggestive of either a summer or
early fall seasonality. In coprolite specimen 26, for example, 90% of
the pollen is from an unidentified taxon of Umbelliferae and 92% of
the macrofossil remains are fibers from some unidentified plant.
Genera of the family Umbelliferae bloom during different periods of
the summer and early fall. As stated earlier, the leaves, stems, and
flowers were often sought as food by early aboriginal groups in North
America, therefore it is possible that both the pollen and plant fiber in
coprolite specimen 26 could represent the gathering and eating of
flowering Umbelliferae plants during some period of either the summer or early fall.
Fall or winter seasonality is represented by the contents of three
coprolites (samples 21, 34, 39) from the lower occupational period of
Frightful Cave. Each of these three coprolites contains high percentages of Cheno-Am and/or high-spine Compositae pollen. Both

102

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

pollen types could have adhered to the seeds of these plants and been
ingested along with the seeds. This proposition is strengthened by the
macrofossil data which show that these seed types were indeed part
of the diet in these three samples. Since Helianthus as well as many of
the Cheno-Am species mature during the late summer and early fall,
their seeds could have been collected and eaten during that time
period. However, the possibility of seed storage for later winter use
must also be considered as a possibility. A spring and/or early summer seasonality is not likely for these three samples since they contain very little indicator pollen from those seasons.
Four of the coprolites (samples 19, 28, 46, 47) from the lower occupational period do not contain any pollen or contain such small
amounts that it is not useful for the reconstruction of either diet or
seasonality. Absence of pollen does nol always reflect a winter
seasonality as some might assume. It is true that except for/uniperus
and certain types of grasses atmospheric pollen levels should be at
their lower percentage during the winter months; yet other factors
could result in the absence of pollen in human coprolites. For example, in each of these four samples the macrofossil evidence shows that
the primary diet item was large amounts of plant fiber. The
prehistoric inhabitants of Frightful Cave could have collected and
eaten large amounts of plant fiber during any season of the year, and
therefore it is not wise to try to speculate as to the season represented
by these four coprolite samples.

Middle Occupational Period -- The coprolites dating from the middle
occupationalperoid (5,000-2.000 B. C.) at Frightful Cave are similar to
those of the upper period in that both groups reveal a predominate
pattern of summer and early fall seasonality. The middle occupational period coprolites wl~ich indicate a late spring or summer
seasonality (samples 15, 16, 17, 27, 29, 31, and 33) contain high percentages of pollen from plants (Agave, Dalea, and Opuntia) which
pollinate during the late spring and summer months. Two of these
coprolites (samples 27, 29) also contained large percentages of whole
cactus seeds which may have resulted from the eating of a few of the
previous year s mature cactus fruits still attached to the plant, or the
eating of some early maturing cactus fruits.
The coprolites from this period suggesting a late summer or early
fall seasonality (samples 3, 13, 22, 43) contain high percentages oI
whole seeds from plants which produce mature fruits in the late summer or early fall (-Asclepius, Celtis, Diospyros, Helianthus, and Opuntia). In addition most of these samples lacked significant quantities of

PREHISTORIC DIETARY ANALYSIS

103

zoophilous economic pollen and instead contained pollen types from
plants such as Gramineae and high-spine Compositae which bloom in
the late summer .....
Three coprolites from the middle occupational period (samples 7, 8,
and 9) each contained high percentages of Quercus pollen combined
with either Agave, Dalea, or Opuntia pollen. The combination of these
two factors suggests that these coprolites may represent an early
spring seasonality rather than either a summer or fall season. Oak
trees pollinate in the early spring yet their pollen is an airborne type
that could become recycled and incorporated into coprolites dating
from other seasons of the year, as is suggested for samples 16, 22, and
27. However, the complimentary association of significant amounts of
economic pollen with the presence of oak pollen is interpreted to
reflect a spring seasonality. The absence of coprolites reflecting a
winter seasonality may have been caused by some of the same
reasons mentioned earlier.

Upper Occupational Period -- The coprolites analyzed from the upper
occupational period (2,000 B. C.-A. D. 300) of Frightful Cave suggest
primarily a summer (sample 1, 2, 12, 14, 18, 23, 24, 30 and 41) and
early fall (sample 4, 5, 11, 25, 36 and 42) seasonality of site occupation. Many of the coprolites from this period assigned summer
seasonality contain high percentages of economic pollen types such
as Agave, Dalea, Solarium, and Portulaca which probably represent
the eating of these flower types during their summer flowering
season. The macrofossils recovered from these same coprolites include large numbers of Prosopis and Opuntia seeds. The Prosopis
seeds probably resulted from the eating of mesquite pods which begin
to mature in that region of northern Mexice by mid-summer while the
Opuntia seeds could have been swallowed during the eating of cactus
fruits which also begin to ripen by mid-summer.
The coprolites of this period representing a fall seasonality lack
significant amounts of economic pollen and instead contain large
amounts of pollen types such as grass and high-spine Compositae
which bloom in the late summer and early fall. These samples also
contain significant quantities of Prosopis, Opuntia, and Diospyros
seeds all of which would be most available in the early fall. I doubt
that these samples which I have assigned to a fall season could
represent a winter diet. Persimmon fruits, mesquite pods, and cactus
fruits are best eaten at maturity when the sugar content is the
highest. Furthermore, if these seeds were being stored for later winter use they would probably have been ground into flour and

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
therefore would not have appeared in the coprolite specimens as
whole seeds. Castetter and Opler (1936) note that the Apaches stored
certain types of seeds (mesquite, sunflower, and screwbean) which
were later ground into flour during the winter months and eaten.
Baegert (1952) also noted that the Indians of lower California ground
cactus seeds into flour during the winter months yet ate the ripe fruits
during the fall rather than storing them for later use.
The absence of coprolites from this occupational period representing other seasons of the year could be due to either or both of the
following possibilities: (1) Frightful Cave may have been occupied by
prehistoric man only during the warmer seasons of the year, or (2)
different hygenic habits may have been practiced dflring the colder
seasons of the year resulting in human defecation either outside the
shelter area or in regions of the shelter which were not excavated by
the archeologists.

SUMMARY
The Frightful Cave coprolites provide us with one of the longest
records of prehistoric man’s diet anywhere in northern Mexico or the
American Southwest. The coprolite macrofossil analysis combined
with my pollen analysis of these same specimens has revealed that
the prehistoric inhabitants of Frightful Cave ate a wide variety of
foods. In some cases the diet items consisted of fruits, leaves, bulbs,
and/or seeds. In other instances the people ate flowers and/or the
flower pollen.
In adition to the diet information these coprolites also provided insight into the probable seasons of site occupation and limited inferences about the paleoenvironment. With the possible exception of
only three specimens the coprolites from Frightful Cave indicate
primarily a cycle of spring and early fall site occupancy. Furthermore, the weak representation of certain pollen types such as
pine, alder, and cattails suggests an absence of these plants in the
local paleovegetation of the Frightful Cave area. If these plants ever
grew in the vicinity of Frightful Cave it would have to have been prior
to 7,500 B. C. The pollen data can also be used to demonstrate that
other plant types such as walnut, pecan, elm and Morman tea were
either absent in the local vegetation composition or were present in
very low quantities.
