This report documents a cultural resource inventory conducted on 1,783 acres at Lake O’ the Pines, Sam Rayburn
Reservoir, and Wright Patman Lake in East Texas for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth
District, in advance of proposed timber harvesting and park improvements. In compliance with Sections 106 and
110 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the inventory was conducted so that cultural resource sites would be
considered in planning and conducting the undertakings.
Fieldwork was conducted between October 2009 and May 2010 and included a 100% pedestrian survey
accompanied by 1,551 shovel tests, of which 139 tests were positive. Recovered artifacts included prehistoric lithic
flakes, projectile points, prehistoric and historic ceramics, metal, and glass. Artifacts will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory.
Thirty archeological sites were recorded. Twelve sites (41AG205, 41MR210, 41MR269, 41MR270, 41NA14, 41NA67,
41NA332, 41NA335, 41SA302, 41SA307, 41SA308, 41SB375) are not eligible for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) and no further work is warranted. Eighteen sites (41AG105, 41AG161, 41AG206, 41AG207,
41AG208, 41AG209, 41AG210, 41NA132, 41NA333, 41NA334, 41SA303, 41SA304, 41SA305, 41SA306, 41SB48,
41SB373, 41SB374, 41SB376) could not be clearly assessed for NRHP eligibility and should be avoided and
protected.

Lake O’ the Pines, Sam Rayburn Reservoir, and Wright Patman Lake

Abstract
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural
resource inventory conducted on 15 separate tracts of land, totaling 1,783 acres, in Angelina,
Bowie, Cass, Marion, Nacogdoches, San Augustine, and Sabine counties in East Texas. The
project area includes 398 acres in six inventory parcels at Lake O’ the Pines, 1,324 acres in
six parcels at Sam Rayburn Reservoir, and 61 acres in three parcels at Wright Patman Lake.
Work was conducted at the request of the Piney Woods Project Office of the United States
Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE). The USACE has proposed park
improvements in 10 parcels and timber harvesting in five parcels. In compliance with Sections
106 and 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the inventory was undertaken to ensure
that any cultural resource sites located on the parcels would be considered in conducting the
undertakings and in planning future undertakings.
Archeological fieldwork was conducted in six sessions: October 28–November 6, November
11–20, December 3–10, 2009, January 5–8, March 23–26, and May 12–13, 2010. Fieldwork
included a 100 percent pedestrian inventory accompanied by manual excavation of 1,230
shovel tests as a discovery tactic, complemented with an additional 321 shovel tests on sites or
around isolated positive shovel tests. Of these, 139 tests were positive, including 122 positive
tests on sites and 16 isolated positive tests. Recovered artifacts consisted of prehistoric lithic
flakes, projectile points, Caddo ceramics, historic ceramics, metal, and glass. All subsurface
artifacts were collected and will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Thirty archeological sites were investigated, including seven previously recorded sites and
23 newly discovered sites. All 30 sites were fully documented and evaluated for significance.
Twelve sites (41AG205, 41MR210, 41MR269, 41MR270, 41NA14, 41NA67, 41NA332,
41NA335, 41SA302, 41SA307, 41SA308, 41SB375) were found to have minimal potential
for further research; these 12 sites had very low subsurface artifact density and/or lacked
depositional integrity and are recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP. Using
the limited shovel testing inventory tactics, a clear assessment of research potential could not
be reached for 18 sites (41AG105, 41AG161, 41AG206, 41AG207, 41AG208, 41AG209,
41AG210, 41NA132, 41NA333, 41NA334, 41SA303, 41SA304, 41SA305, 41SA306,
41SB48, 41SB373, 41SB374, 41SB376). Further investigation may show that many of these 18
sites indeed have good research potential, but at present they are assessed as having uncertain
eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.

Lake O’ the Pines, Sam Rayburn Reservoir, and Wright Patman Lake

Chapter 1

Project Description
1.1	The Undertaking
The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE), is responsible for
managing certain federally owned lands in East Texas in association with lakes, reservoirs,
and navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 9,251 acres at Lake O’
the Pines, 17,461 acres at Sam Rayburn Reservoir, and 45,063 acres at Wright Patman Lake
(acreages are outside conservation pool).
While planning and conducting undertakings that have the potential to affect historic
properties, the USACE must consider such resources. Therefore, in compliance with
Sections 106 and 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended
through 1992 (P. L. 89–665 et seq.), the current inventories were authorized by the USACE
to identify any archeological sites, buildings, structures, or other resources that may be
eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All inventories
were conducted on and all sites are located on lands owned by the federal government and
managed by the USACE.
Much of the USACE-managed acreage at all three lakes is forested by mature pine and
hardwood stands. In conjunction with the existing management plans for the reservoirs,
and in accordance with accepted silviculture methodologies, the USACE has planned
for selective timber thinning in certain management areas at these lakes. Commercial
thinning removes marketable trees in uneven-aged stands (not clear-cut) through singletree selection. Removal of crop trees often disturbs the ground surface, but extensive
subsurface disturbance is not common.
In addition to timber thinning, improvements to recreational facilities are planned at the
parks around Lake O’ the Pines and Wright Patman Lake, and at Powell Park at Sam
Rayburn Reservoir. These improvements include upgrades to the restroom facilities as
well as construction of new recreational vehicle (RV) pads and roads. For the most part, the
planned undertakings at these locations include shallow ground disturbances less than 24
inches, or 60 centimeters (cm); localized disturbances up to several feet deep are possible
in association with restroom upgrades.

1.2.2 Sam Rayburn Reservoir
Congress authorized the creation of Sam Rayburn Reservoir in 1955 for the purposes of flood
control along the Angelina River, hydroelectric power generation, and conservation of water
for municipalities, industry, agriculture, and recreation. USACE began construction of the
reservoir in 1956, and impoundment began in 1965. Initially known as McGee Bend Reservoir,
the lake was renamed in honor of Speaker of the US House of Representatives Sam Rayburn.
The lake is the largest body of water in Texas. The conservation pool level is 164.4 ft amsl
(50.1 m amsl), and the lake has approximately 750 miles (1,207 km) of shoreline (Figure 1-8)
(US Army Corps of Engineers [USACE] 2010). The inventory includes six parcels totaling
1,324 acres. Timber thinning is proposed for these parcels with the exception of Powell Park,
where improvements to the park facilities are planned.

Project Description

Oak Park
Oak Park is located in Bowie County on the eastern end of Wright Patman Lake, about 16 km
southwest of Texarkana and 22 km north of Atlanta (see Figure 1-17). Totaling approximately
29 acres, this parcel is situated 1.9 km north of the Wright Patman Dam outflow, and along
the dry side of the earthen dam. The pentagonal tract measures about 530 m northeast–
southwest by 300 m northwest–southeast. It is located in the Wright Patman Lake USGS 7.5’
topographic quadrangle. Elevation is a steady 233 ft amsl (71.0 m amsl) across the entire
parcel.

1.3	Natural Environment
The project area is located in the Piney Woods region of East Texas. Forested areas in the
region include secondary growth and mature pine and pine-hardwood stands. Pine stands
observed during the field inventory typically consisted of loblolly (Pinus taeda), shortleaf
(Pinus echinata), and longleaf (Pinus palustris) pines. Hardwood trees were predominantly
various oaks, including southern red oak (Quercus falcate), white oak (Quercus alba), and
sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua) (Diggs et al. 1999). Figures 1-18 and 1-19 illustrate
typical landscape views for the project area.
Wildlife species common to the area include whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red fox
(Vulpes vulpes), bobcat (Felis rufus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum
(Didelphus virginiana), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), nutria (Myocastor
coypus), river otter (Lutra canadensis), and mink (Mustela vison) (Davis and Schmidly 1994).
Lake habitats support a variety of turtles (Figure 1-20), frogs, and snakes, as well as largemouth
bass (Micropterus salmoides salmoides), flathead (Pylodictis olivaris) and channel (Ictalurus

red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), osprey
(Pandion haliaetus), bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura),
white pelicans (Elecanus erythrorhynchos), common loons (Gavia immer), herons (Ardea
spp.), and egrets (Egretta spp.) (Bull and Farrand 1996).

1.4	Geology and Soils
1.4.1 Underlying Geological Formations
Four of the five parcels at Lake O’ the Pines are within the Queen City Sand formation (Eqc),
which consists of layers of red and white sands and sandy clays with depths near 200 ft (Sellards
et al. 1990:628). The one remaining parcel (Brushy Creek Park) is entirely within Holocene
and Pleistocene Terrace Deposits (Qt) left behind from a previous course of Big Cypress Bayou
(Hartmann and Scranton 1992).
At Sam Rayburn Reservoir, Compartment 7A is within Holocene Alluvium (Qal) and Yazoo
formations (Eya), both of which consist of marine clays, silts, and sands up to 200 ft thick
(US Geological Survey [USGS] 2010). Compartments 11A and 15B are entirely within the
Cadell Formation (Eca) with clay and very fine quartz sand down to 150 ft. Compartment 23
is partially within the Sparta Sand (Es) formation with fine-grained quartz sand and clays up
to 150 ft thick, and the Yegua Formation (Ey), which is mostly clay to a depth of 1,000 ft.
Compartment 40 is on transition zone between the Cadell (Eca) and Yegua (Ey) formations.
Powell Park is entire within the Yazoo Formation (Eya) (USGS 2010).
At Wright Patman Lake, Jackson Creek is within Holocene Alluvium (Qal), described above,
and Reklaw Formation (Er), which consists of quartz sands and clays about 80 ft thick over
1,200 ft of silty and sandy clays. The Elliott’s Bluff and Oak Park parcels are both within the
Wilcox Group, undivided (Ewi), characterized by about 700 ft of sand, clay and mudstone
(USGS 2010).

1.4.2 Soil Formations
Lake O’ the Pines
Soils within the Lake O’ the Pines survey areas include Bowie, Briley, Cuthbert, Darco, Iulus,
Kirvin, Lilbert, and Tenaha series (Soil Survey Staff 2010). All soil descriptions are from the

Project Description

Soils within the Elliott’s Bluff and Oak Park parcels include Sawyer series and an unnamed
udorthent series (see Table 1-13). The unnamed udorthent series has sandy clay loam to well
below 80 cmbs. The Sawyer series soils have silty loam to 65 cmbs with Pleistocene clays
below.

1.4.3 Archeological Potential of the Soils
All of the survey parcels have the potential to contain intact, buried archeological deposits.
The landscape of East Texas and northwestern Louisiana is known as the “sandy mantle”
and is generally characterized as “weakly consolidated, Tertiary age fluvial-deltaic deposits
of predominantly sandy texture” (Frederick et al. 2002:191). In Texas, the sandy mantle is
a soil formation that “extends in a slowly expanding pattern from south of San Antonio in a
northeasterly direction into East Texas” (Nickels and Lehman 2004:107), closely following
the distribution of sandy Eocene deposits, known as the Claiborne formation. All four of the
inventoried parcels near Sam Rayburn Reservoir are within this geographical feature.
Archeological significance of the sandy mantle area is currently heavily debated because
the age and origin of this formation is unknown (Boulter et al. 2007). Stratigraphically, the
sandy mantle is composed of an A-E-Bt pedon, with the Bt pedon dating to the Pleistocene.
The problems encountered with archeological projects located in this area lie in the debate
as to the age of the sands, rather than the formation of the A-E pedons. Some scientists argue
that the formation of the sandy mantle is predominately of pedogenic origins, whereas others
argue that the formation is attributed to colluvial and eolian processes (see Heinrich 1986;
Rogers 1994; Thoms 1993). According to Frederick et al. (2002:191–192), if the soils over
the Bt horizon “are the product of in situ pedological weathering of Tertiary bedrock, then
the A-E-Bt horizon all formed simultaneously from the same parent material.” Accordingly,
cultural material found within these soils is affected by pedoturbation, meaning that “these
sites would have minimal integrity and would be unworthy of preservation or excavation.”
However, if the soils are a product of colluvial and eolian processes, the underlying argillic
formation (Bt pedons) was already established; therefore, cultural material in these soils are
in context and have archeological significance (Frederick et al. 2002:191–192).
Research geared towards understanding the formation of the sandy mantle has been conducted
by various projects in the sandy mantle area (e.g., Boulter et al. 2007; Bruseth and Martin
2001; Frederick et al. 2000, 2002; Nickels and Lehman 2004). One in particular, Fredrick et
al. (2002), provides evidence of eolian deposition on uplands based on optically stimulated
luminescence dating. In their research, 33 samples were collected from an excavated trench
at 41LE191. Seven of the samples were collected from the sand above the Bt horizon, one
from the Bt horizon, six from unconsolidated sands, and 19 others from the same profile as a
control. Results of their findings (see Fredrick et al. 2002) show that sands covering the hill
at 41LE191 were deposited during the Holocene and were not a product of in situ deposition.
This is only shown for this area; other research shows that it can be applied throughout the
sandy mantle area.

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,783 Acres at
Lake O’ the Pines, Sam Rayburn Reservoir, and Wright Patman Lake

From 2002 to 2003, the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at Texas State UniversitySan Marcos conducted extensive archeological work in the 11,500-acre confines of Camp
Swift in Bastrop County. One of the primary research issues addressed by CAS during their
work was the formation of the sandy mantle. For the survey phase, CAS conducted a study
measuring the depth of the sand deposits based on depths recorded from the excavations
of over 800 shovel tests in 57 different locations in the Camp Swift Texas National Guard
base. Their research compared depths in different settings (i.e., terraces, foot slopes, side
slopes, drainage ways, ridges, and uplands) to the vertical distribution of cultural material
in these specific locations. From this research, it was shown that sand depths varied across
the landscape, and “that the physiographic setting cannot be viewed as an overriding
consideration when evaluating site depth, intensity of use, and integrity”; therefore, “sites
must be tested on a case-by-case basis regardless of their setting” (Nickels and Lehman
2004:124).
In 2002, CAS conducted NRHP eligibility testing on 20 prehistoric sites that included
the excavation of 120 test units and six backhoe trenches. The results of testing revealed
stratigraphic correlations in the data that suggest some sites in the sandy mantel indeed
contain deep, intact deposits of cultural materials. This conclusion was based on data gathered
from multilinear, corroborating lines of evidence including soil susceptibility values, pH
values, statistical data, artifact densities and sizes, non-artifact densities and sizes, soil
horizons, archeomagnetic samples, projectile point typology, clay lamella development, and
14
C samples (David Nickels, personnel communication 2008; Nickels et al. 2009).

2.1	Previous Investigations
A map and records search was conducted using the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC)
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas online database on October 19, 2009, and May 11, 2010. Eight
previously recorded sites were plotted within five of the 15 survey parcels. EComm revisited
each site (or the location on record of each site) during inventory of each parcel. The Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas shows 150 sites located within one mile of the 15 survey parcels.

2.1.1 Lake O’ the Pines
Alley Creek Park
In 1951, the National Parks Service (NPS) conducted a River Basin Survey of Big Cypress
Bayou before Lake O’ the Pines was impounded; this survey covered up to the shores of the
park to the south and east. The River Basin Survey recorded one site within a mile of the
Alley Creek Park parcel. A large multiple-locus site was recorded southwest of the park area
in 1957, but no survey data are available. Three surveys were conducted by the USACE in the
late 1990s, the closest of which is directly north of the park. This closest survey, conducted
by Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), recorded two sites along the shoreline north of the park. Three
additional sites are located within one mile of Alley Creek Park. All seven sites are described
in Table 2-1 below.

Cultural Context

Johnson Creek Park
The boundary of the 1951 River Basin Survey was along the southern and eastern shore of
Johnson Creek Park and only one site was recorded within a mile of the parcel. In 1974,
Gulf South Research Institute conducted a small survey across the lake in which one site was
recorded; EComm revisited this site in 2005. GMI conducted a survey of the lands to the
west and north of the park, finding one site. At least three other surveys were conducted in
the area but no further data is available in the THC Atlas. The first survey, by W. A. David in
1957, recorded four sites with one mile of the park. The second survey, conducted by Moore
Archeological Consulting in 1994 recorded four sites. The third, by Bo Nelson in 1997 also
resulted in four sites recorded. Fifteen of these sites and two additional sites are recorded in

Buckhorn Creek Park and Overlook Park
The 1951 River Basin Survey covered these parcels entirely and found no sites within a mile of
the parks. An Army Corps survey was conducted a small survey 200 m north of the parcels in
2002 with no sites recorded. Bo Nelson recorded a site nearly a mile to the northwest in 1994
and recorded two more sites to the east in 1999.
Some confusion exists as to the locations of sites 41MR103, 104, 105, and 106. USACE maps
provided to EComm show these sites located just northwest of the Buckhorn Creek Park
parcel. In contrast, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas has these sites plotted more than 4 km
to the east and on the opposite shore of the lake. Text site descriptions mention the lake as to
the west in support of the USACE maps. However, the UTM coordinates on the site forms
match the THC data (even while plotting three of sites underwater). Our conclusion is that
the USACE maps correctly plot the locations for these four sites; the UTM coordinates on
the forms were evidently erroneously calculated before the use of modern GPS receivers, and
these coordinates were used to plot the sites on the THC atlas. In 2005, EComm ground-truthed
the erroneous (THC) location of 41MR103 and found that location to be completely inundated.
All sites are described in Table 2-3 below.

Brushy Creek Park
The 1951 River Basin Survey covered the low-lying areas of the Brushy Creek Park, but no sites
were recorded. A small outlying portion of the River Basin Survey, located about one kilometer
inland from the shoreline, recorded one site. In 1974, Gulf South Research Institute conducted
a small survey northeast of the parcel and recorded one site. In 1975, the Texas Department of
Highways and Public Transportation (later Texas Department of Transportation) conducted a
linear survey to the southeast for the Texas 3001 alignment; no sites were recorded during the
project. GMI conducted a survey south of the park in 1995 in which three sites were recorded.
GMI also investigated a historic homestead northeast of the parcel in 1997. In 2005, EComm
conducted a survey of the landform to the northeast in which the correct location of 41MR62
was established. In 1998, a survey was conducted resulting in three sites recorded within one
mile of the parcel, but no data other than the location of the sites and sketch maps are available.
In 2002, another unspecified survey was conducted and a site was recorded within one mile of
the Brushy Creek Parcel; only the site location is on record. Sites within one mile of the Brushy
Creek Parcel are listed in Table 2-4.
Copeland Creek Park
The 1951 River Basin Survey covered the low-lying northern and western shores of the
Copeland Creek Park parcel. The River Basin Survey did not record any sites within the parcel,
but did record five sites across Copeland Creek to the west. In 1974, Gulf South Research
Institute recorded a site to the northwest. In 1998 and 2002, two surveys were conducted in
which five sites were recorded, but the only data available from THC are the site locations and
sketch maps for three of the sites. Sites within one mile of the Copeland Creek Parcel are listed
in Table 2-5.

In 1948, the NPS conducted the River Basin Survey, during which four sites were located
within a mile of the Compartment 7A parcel. Another survey was conducted in 1997 by AR
Consultants on a parcel three-quarters of a mile to the south east, in which five sites were
recorded; one of these was historic. An additional four sites have been recorded within one
mile of Compartment 7A but have no additional data in the THC Atlas. All sites within one

Compartments 11A and 15B
Several surveys have been conducted within parts of the Compartment 11A parcel or within
one mile of it, including the 1948 River Basin Survey. The River Basin Survey overlaps the
western half of the compartment and resulted in no new sites discovered within a mile. Two
surveys were conducted by the USACE in 1997 and 2001 that cover the northern half of the
peninsula; one site was located in these surveys. EComm conducted a survey about threequarters of a mile to the east in 2007 that resulted in no new sites. In 1993, the USACE
conducted two surveys near Compartment 11A, one to the southeast along the shoreline of
Buck Bay and one to the north along the shoreline of an unnamed inlet of Sam Rayburn. Three
additional sites were recorded by Carey D. Weber inside of previously surveyed areas near the
parcel, but no survey data are recorded. An additional site is recorded to the north of the parcel
but no data are available from the THC Atlas. All five of these sites are described below in
Table 2-7.
The 1948 River Basin Survey completely covered the Compartment 15B parcel, but no sites
were found within a mile of the parcel during that survey. In 1981, John Ippolito recorded
site 41SA151 to the north, but there are no survey data in the THC Atlas. Additionally, sites
41SA148 and 41SA149, listed in Table 2-7, are within one mile of Compartment 15B.

The 1948 River Basin Survey completely covered this parcel; no sites were found inside of the
parcel, but two sites were found across the lake. In 1973, T. E. Mayhew did some work in the
area and found three sites, one of which is inside the parcel. Carey D. Weber recorded seven
sites within a mile of the parcel; two of these are inside of the parcel boundaries. All 13 of these
sites are listed in Table 2-8 below.

The 1948 River Basin Survey covered this entire parcel except for about three acres. The River
Basin Survey resulted with only one site within a mile of the parcel. This site, 41AG28, has
been revisited several times, including once by EComm in 2003. EComm has conducted two
surveys within a mile of the parcels, one in 2002 north of Compartment 40 and one in 2003 to
the east, which revisited 41AG28. In 1980 three local archeologists, Oliver Bounds, Darcey
Faircloth, and Carey Weber, recorded 23 new sites. AR Consultants recorded six new sites and
revisited three of the above 23 sites. An additional two sites have been recorded in the area, and
all sites are described in Table 2-9.

Powell Park was completely surveyed in 1948 during the River Basin Survey. The survey
recorded one site almost a mile away in a now submerged portion of the lake. The land directly
south of the parcel was surveyed in 2009 by the USACE, and EComm surveyed the areas
directly west and north in 2007. An additional five surveys were conducted to the south in 1993

Jackson Creek
In 1949, the National Parks Service (NPS) conducted a River Basin Survey of Big Cypress
Bayou before Lake O’ the Pines was impounded. The River Basin Survey recorded one site
within a mile of the Jackson Creek parcel. In 1970, a survey was conducted around the lake to
allow for the lake level to be increased to the current level; this survey covered over 80 percent
of the parcel. This Lake Texarkana Enlargement survey recorded 18 sites within a mile of the
parcel, including one (41CS102) that is plotted on the western boundary of the parcel. GeoMarine, Inc., conducted two surveys in the area, one in 1994 and one in 2000, in which ten new
sites were recorded within a mile of the parcel. EComm conducted a survey in 2004, during
which four new sites were recorded in the area. An additional site was recorded in the area, but
no evidence of a survey could be located. All 33 sites are recorded in Table 2-11 below.

Elliott’s Bluff and Oak Park
The 1949 River Basin and the Lake Texarkana Lake Enlargement surveys both came near
the Elliott’s Bluff parcel, with the latter actually marked as crossing a portion of the parcel,
but both of the surveys are not entirely marked on the THC Atlas. The River Basin Survey
resulted in one site recorded to the north of the parcel, while the Texarkana Enlargement survey
recorded five sites along the shoreline and one additional site on the dry side of the dam near
Highway 59. A survey was conducted along Highway 59 in 1976, but no sites were recorded
within a mile of the parcels. EComm conducted a survey east of Oak Park on the eastern side
of Highway 59 in 2002, during which one site was recorded within a mile of the parcels. An
additional site was recorded near Highway 59 southeast of the parcels in 1973. All nine sites
are recorded in Table 2-12 below.

2.2	Cultural Framework
The archeological regions of Texas vary depending on what research is used to determine the
cultural framework of the project area. In some cases, such as in Turner and Hester (1999),
Texas is divided in to nine archeological regions, whereas Perttula (2004) further divides
these regions into 16 distinct archeological regions based on physiographic zones and biotic
communities. According to Turner and Hester’s divisions, the project is located in the East
Texas Archeological Region, whereas in Perttula’s (2004) model the project area is located
in Deep East Texas. Whatever the case may be, both models of the archeological regions of
Texas are correct; however, Perttula’s division better suits the project area ecologically and
physiographically. For the purpose of this report, Perttula’s (2004), model will be used in
discussing the cultural framework of the region. The prehistoric cultural framework of the
Deep East Texas region includes the Paleoindian period, Archaic and Woodland periods, and
periods of Caddo horticultural adaptation. Much of the information known about this region
has been recorded by many archeological investigations, beginning in the 1930s. This cultural
framework, discussed further below, has been adapted from Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993) and
Perttula (1993a, 1993b, 1995, 2004).

2.2.1 Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian period describes the time in which North America was first occupied by
peoples migrating from the Old World. The occupation of the New World is due in part to
the migration of extinct fauna (e.g., bison, camel, and horse) across the newly open lands and
the people who followed them, relying on these animals for everyday subsistence. Although
this portrayal of the early occupants of North America is generally accepted among some
archeologists, others see the Paleoindian period as a time in which Pleistocene peoples are
separated into Early and Late stages ca. 12,000–8000 BP, based on cultural traditions of tool
technologies (Bousman et al. 2004).
These stages differ from area to area and region to region depending on the data recorded in
those regions. There is a lack of good data in East Texas relating to the Paleoindian period.
While many projectile points such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, Scottsbluff, and San Patrice
have been recovered, most were isolated, mixed, found on the surface, or found in excavations
of later contexts (Perttula 2004). The distribution of artifacts suggests that most sites occur in
the valleys of major stream basins and resource-rich areas. Available evidence suggests that
groups occupied small camps, used a generalized toolkit, and were more likely to be highly
mobile hunters and gatherers rather than specialized large-game hunters (Perttula 2004).

2.2.2 Archaic Period
The Archaic period signifies a shift to a less mobile, more generalized subsistence strategy.
This change in subsistence strategies shows a greater exploitation of local environments with

Ecological Communications Corporation

41

Chapter 2

Cultural Context

the exploitation of plants and animals located in the immediate vicinity. Along with the change
in subsistence, a change is also seen in lithic technology. Evidence of this is apparent in the
archeological record, as lanceolate-shaped points gave way to stemmed and barbed dart points
and the presence of ground stone increased (Collins 2004). Although Archaic peoples were still
nomadic in nature, travel became more seasonal, utilizing food resources specific to certain
localities.
According to Collins (1995), the Archaic period in Texas lasted approximately 7,500 years,
from 8800 to about 1300 BP, and is divided into three sub-stages: the Early Archaic (8800–
6000 BP), the Middle Archaic (6000–4000 BP), and the Late Archaic (4000–1300 or 1200
BP). However, in the East Texas Archeological Region, reliable dating is not yet available to
unequivocally substantiate these different periods.
During the Early Archaic period, the climate changed from the wet and mild conditions seen
in the Paleoindian stage to a warmer and drier climate, ultimately leading to severe xeric
conditions during the middle stages of the Early Archaic. These climate changes forced the
peoples of the Early Archaic to broaden their subsistence strategies from hunting bison to
include the exploitation of resources such as acorns, fruits, rodents, deer, and prickly pear (Story
1985:38–39; Weir 1976). Settlement patterns also change during the Early Archaic. Sites are
smaller and more widely distributed, suggesting high group mobility within large territories.
Although most Early Archaic sites are only briefly used, they are apt to be concentrated in the
larger drainage areas in the region (Perttula 2004).
The Middle Archaic is characterized by larger sites in major basins in the region, a more
diverse hunting toolkit, the use of ground and polished stone tools, and the increased use of
plant foods as indicated by grinding implements and burned rock features. Possible hearths,
ovens, and burned rock concentrations in the region suggest the importance of processing and
cooking plant resources (Perttula 2004).
Throughout East Texas, Late Archaic-period sites are relatively common along major streams
and springs in the uplands and on tributary drainages. During the Late Archaic, population
density may have peaked, as evidenced by the apparent increase in the number of sites and
greater distribution of sites over the landscape. The large number and widespread distribution
of sites also suggests limited group mobility, the possible use of more defined territories, and
regular exploitation of localized food resources (Perttula 2004).

2.2.3 Woodland/Early Ceramic Period
The Woodland period (ca. 200 BC–AD 800) is not well defined but is largely identified by
plainware ceramics, tempered with clay/grog or bone, and by Gary projectile points. At sites
near the Red River, artifact assemblages are largely made up of ceramics, while at other sites
in Northeast Texas, such as near the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, ceramics are not as common.
One explanation for this difference may be possible regional differences in food processing
and diet during this period, all of which may have an effect on the degree of sedentism between
regions (Perttula 2004).
42

United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,783 Acres at
Lake O’ the Pines, Sam Rayburn Reservoir, and Wright Patman Lake

To date, archeological evidence suggests that Woodland populations were hunters and gatherers
living in larger groups and settling in given locations for longer periods than they had during
the Archaic period. In some instances (e.g., Skibo and Blinman 1999) pottery making is linked
to sedentism, perhaps giving reason for these long stays. In cases such as at the Ray Site, small
settlements with structures and middens suggest a more concentrated occupation, but these
sites are not as permanent as those seen at later Caddo-period sites in the region (Perttula
2004). With the exception of sites in the Sulphur and Neches-Angelina river basins, Woodland
sites are not very common throughout much of Northeast Texas, but when they occur, they
are represented by villages and hamlets in the floodplains or on terraces of larger streams, and
also by smaller components in the uplands. No Woodland-period burial mounds have been
documented in the region.

2.2.4 Formative Caddo Period and Early Caddo Period
Sites dating to the Formative Caddo (ca. AD 800–1000) and Early Caddo periods (ca. AD
1000–1200) are located primarily in the uplands just adjacent to major streams and smaller
tributaries and springs. Settlement locations with fertile soils and good drainage were primarily
chosen for habitation and cultivation of maize, squash, and native plants. Permanent settlements
were widespread that included structures, middens, pits, and cemeteries, and artifacts such as
tools and ceramics. Common settlements in the region include hamlets and farmsteads with
rectangular and circular structures, many with associated cemeteries. In addition to small
farmsteads, larger communities are also encountered, such as the George C. Davis Site on
the Neches River. These large villages are more common during the Early Caddo period and
continue through the Middle Caddo period, and include large groups of many structures, mound
centers, and elite burial pits. Distinctive artifacts such as celts, ceramic pipes and earspools,
and diversely decorated ceramic bowls and jars are commonly recovered from Formative and
Early Caddo sites (Perttula 2004).

2.2.5 Middle Caddo Period
The majority of archeological sites in Northeast Texas date to the Middle Caddo period (ca. AD
1200–1400). These sites continue the trend of diverse ceramic artifacts and larger settlements
with multiple mounds seen at the end of the Early Caddo period. One example of such a site is
the Oak Hill Village (41RK214), a large village with mounds, middens, and public structures.
Cultivation of maize and squash continued, but there is no evidence of dependence on maize
and other crops until after AD 1300 (Perttula 2004).

2.2.6 Late Caddo Period
Archeological sites that date to the Late Caddo period (ca. AD 1400–1680) are abundant in
Northeast Texas. Late Caddo sites are predominantly found in river basins such as the Red,
Cypress Creek, and Neches river basins. Smaller groups of sites are present in the Angelina,
Attoyac, middle and upper Sabine, and lower Cypress Bayou basins. Most Late Caddo period
archeological sites are either large permanent communities or smaller farmsteads, both with

associated cemeteries. Late Caddo-period earthen mounds were constructed and primarily
used from AD 1400 to 1540, except in the Red River, where mound construction and mound
shaft burials continued until 1650 or 1700 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Stable isotope and
bioarcheological evidence from the region indicate that at this time Caddo peoples were heavily
dependent on maize as their main dietary staple.
The Late Caddo Titus phase (ca. AD 1430–1680) refers to the archeological remains of Caddo
peoples that lived in the northeastern portion of the Texas Piney Woods between the Sulphur
and Sabine rivers. These Caddo peoples lived in a hierarchical and elite-controlled society.
They constructed both small settlements with family cemeteries and large settlements with
status-ranked community cemeteries, and made culturally distinct and diverse ceramics. Titusphase sites are usually found on valley terraces and upland slopes, projections, and basins, and
permanent settlements are usually located near freshwater springs (Perttula 2004).

2.2.7 Historic Period
Historic Caddo Period
Europeans in the region define the Historic Caddo period (ca. AD 1680–1860) as the sustained
European presence in and occupation of the Caddo area. It is during this period that the Caddo
and all other Native American groups except the Alabama and Coushatta were eventually moved
from Texas to the Indian Territory. Most Historic Caddo settlements in the region were small
farmsteads and hamlets with associated household cemeteries. Communities were composed
of many of these farmsteads spread out over large territories. Artifacts recovered from these
sites include a wide variety of Caddo ceramics, basketry, ornaments, and bone, stone, and
wooden tools. European goods are commonly found on Historic Caddo sites after ca. AD 1740
and include guns and gun parts, glass beads, and metal items such as kettles, hatchets, knives,
hoes, lead balls, and silver, brass, and copper ornaments (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
European Exploration and Historic Periods
Area of Lake O’ the Pines
Much of the area around Big Cypress Creek and what would eventually become Lake O’
the Pines remained uninhabited for most of the eighteenth century. The first Anglo-American
settlements were formed in the 1840s, and the town of Jefferson was founded at that time.
The settlers were primarily from Tennessee and Alabama; the area of east Upshur County and
Marion County was inhabited by settlers from Alabama. They set up a way of life similar to
what they had at home, which included large cotton plantations using slave labor (Atkins 2010;
Kirby 2010).
Jefferson quickly became a booming river port town, in fact the largest inland port in Texas.
North Texas agricultural produce was shipped to Shreveport and New Orleans, and as a result
of this connection with the Mississippi River system and factories to the east, new amenities

44

Lake O’ the Pines, Sam Rayburn Reservoir, and Wright Patman Lake

such as refrigeration, soda water, artificial gas for lighting, and ice production made their first
appearance as early as the 1870s (Atkins 2010). The white population supported the secession
movement and the Confederacy in the Civil War, and ordnance, rifles, and tinned food were
manufactured for the Confederate forces. Military occupation followed the Civil War, although
white suppression of the black majority continued to persist. Jefferson declined significantly in
1873, when the destruction of the “raft” (a massive log jam) on the Red River above Shreveport
reduced the water levels of Big Cypress Creek. The establishment of rail transportation in other
parts of the state also contributed to its decline (Long 2010a).
Rich iron ore deposits in eastern Upshur County had been mined on and off since the 1860s,
but the town of Ore City was not founded until 1911, anticipating the arrival of the Port Bolivar
Iron Ore Railroad. This railroad was chartered in December 1910 to connect Longview with
an area rich in iron ore near Hughes Springs, a distance of about 50 miles. Construction began
in 1912, but World War I halted completion of the line and it was abandoned in 1927 (Young
2010). Ore City operated as a mining and lumbering center, and managed to survive after these
major industries became non-operational (Long 2010b). Oil was discovered in the 1910s and
gave a boost to the manufacturing sector. The Depression dealt the area a hard blow, especially
the agricultural economy, but rising oil prices and federal assistance helped the area recover
more quickly than other areas of Texas. The economy and population of the area declined
slightly over the next 30 years, but the area moved more toward a tourist economy with the
development of urban heritage sites in Jefferson, obtaining NRHP status in 1971, as well as
water recreation from Caddo Lake State Park and Lake O’ the Pines, which were developed in
the 1930s and 1950s, respectively.
Area of Sam Rayburn Reservoir
The area around the future Sam Rayburn Reservoir was re-inhabited by Antonio Gil Ibarvo and
his fellow settlers in 1779 at the location of the previously abandoned mission in the Nacogdoches
area. The Spanish also settled areas to the southeast of Nacogdoches along the Angelina River,
called the Ayish Bayou District, in the late eighteenth century. Shortly after Nacogdoches’
founding, Ibarvo built a building called the Old Stone Fort for business and administration, and
the settlement became a center for illegal trade between Spanish, French, and Americans (Long
2010c; McDonald 1981). Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Nacogdoches
was the central location of politics in East Texas. Around 1812, Joaquín de Arredondo sacked
the town for housing supporters of Augustus Magee and Bernardo Guitiérrez. It became the
stage for a battle in 1832 that helped instigate the Texas Revolution, as well as was the center
of the Córdova uprising 1838 (McDonald 1981).
San Augustine, the only other densely inhabited area during this time, also participated
heavily in political activities and conflicts (Crocket 1932). Although the region was constantly
contested in the 1820s and 1830s, Anglo-American settlers continued to come and set up farms
in what would become Nacogdoches, Angelina, San Augustine, Tyler, and Jasper counties.
Bevil’s Settlement, later called Jasper, was founded in 1824 by John Bevil and became the seat
of Jasper County in 1844 (Smith 1979). The first ferry and port town in the area, Town Bluff,

was settled on the Neches River in 1833 as part of the Lorenzo de Zavala’s colony. Woodville
was established in 1846 when Tyler County was formed and quickly established itself as the
county seat.
By 1844, after the Regulator-Moderator War in the east, most of the area had seen the last of
openly violent conflict (McCroskey 2010). However, a new conflict was brewing that eventually
erupted into the Civil War. Mostly Southerners who carried the slave-run plantation culture
with them settled the region. Unlike their neighbors to the north, much of the environment was
not conducive to cotton production, so many who remained in the area were poor farmers with
few or no slaves, relying on subsistence agriculture, corn, and hogs, as well as some tobacco,
rice, and cattle. Steamboats ferried corn, cotton, and other products down the Angelina and
other navigable rivers to markets in the east, and many towns derived their income from
port fees. As a result, the reaction of the region’s inhabitants to secession was mixed. The
Mexican population in Nacogdoches did not approve of secession, but the area eventually
voted to support the cause (Long 2010c). Angelina County was one of the few in the state to
reject secession altogether (Boon 1937). The other counties to the south and east stuck to their
Southern roots and supported the action, sometimes by an overwhelming margin. Once the
Civil War began, all the inhabitants of the region supported the Confederate Army, supplying
troops and some iron goods. San Augustine was occupied by Confederate troops to guard
against invasion, but no battles were fought in the area.
The towns of Nacogdoches, Woodville, and Jasper were occupied by Union troops during
Reconstruction, and some KKK-like organizations were formed to force African-American
activists out of the area; however, these organizations dissolved soon after they were created.
The region suffered economically after the Civil War, and it did not begin to recover until the
railroads were built in the 1880s. All but San Augustine County had railroads built by the end
of the nineteenth century, and this mode of transportation enabled lumbering to develop in
full force. Towns such as Colmesneil, Rockland, Browndell, Zavalla, and Broaddus sprung up
around new sawmills, and existing towns began to harvest nearby timber for a new source of
income (St. Clair and St. Clair 1982; Wooster 2010). However, poor timber renewal practices
and the Depression caused timber sales to plummet in the 1930s, and several small towns were
deserted. In most areas, raising livestock began to replace what little cotton production was
present, and modest oil extraction was developed to support the economy in Nacogdoches
and Jasper counties. However, the primary economy remained agricultural, and the people
maintained a steady rural lifestyle. Timber harvesting was revived during and after World
War II, but not to the extent of previous years. Other areas began planting sugar cane, raising
poultry, and manufacturing tung (to make lacquer). Sam Rayburn Reservoir was completed in
1965, and tourism helped to revive the regional economy.
Area of Wright Patman Lake
The first likely European expedition into the area around Wright Patman Lake was led by Luis
de Moscoso Alvarado in 1542. Moscoso was a member of the Hernando de Soto expedition
into the southeastern US and took over after he died in 1539. Looking for an overland route

46

Lake O’ the Pines, Sam Rayburn Reservoir, and Wright Patman Lake

back to New Spain, he crossed into the territory that became Bowie County, and used existing
trails established by the Caddo to move further into the interior of Texas before turning around
and traveling back to the coast by way of the Mississippi River (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1993).
French visitors to the area included Henri Joutel, who was part of the LaSalle expedition,
and Henri de Tonti, who went to the area to look for survivors from Fort St. Louis (Harper
2010a). Permanent European presence began in 1719, when Le Poste des Cadodaquious
was established by the French at a location just to the northwest of Texarkana. Although a
fort in name, the establishment served more as a trading station and supply base for further
expeditions. The fort was abandoned a few years after the Louisiana secession to Spain in 1762.
The fort was reestablished in 1770 by the Spanish,under the name San Luiz de los Cadodachos,
but the Nasoni tribes with whom they were trying to foster a relationship left the area soon
after (Britton 2010). Finally, the Americans explored the area in 1806 when the Red River
Expedition, launched by Thomas Jefferson, traveled up the Red River to Spanish Bluff, where
they were forced to turn back by Spanish soldiers.
Immigration and settlement of the areas that would become Bowie and Cass counties began
in the 1820s and 1830s. Both Anglo-Americans and members of the Shawnee, Delaware, and
Kickapoo Indians settled there, but the Native American tribes moved on within ten years. By
1846, the establishment of separate counties had been made and county lines had been resolved.
The white settlers were primarily from the South and set up slave-operated cotton plantations
as well as raised corn, hogs, and some cattle. Just before the Civil War, the slave population
outnumbered the white population in Bowie County, and numbered just under half in Cass
County (Harper 2010a, 2010b). As was expected, the white population strongly supported the
secession movement and the Confederate war effort. Although no battle took place in the area,
federal troops occupied Bowie County in 1867 on behalf of the Freedmen’s Bureau to assist
black residents in obtaining their legal and political equality. This enflamed white residents,
who had lost much of their capital once the slaves were freed, and secretly supported anti-black
movements such as Cullen Baker’s gang and the Ku Klux Klan.
By the 1870s, the Texas and Pacific Railway was being built and several towns sprouted up
in the area. Texarkana was founded in 1873, at the site of an abandoned Caddo village, where
two major railroads would soon meet (Chandler and Howe 1939). It immediately became the
largest trading and manufacturing center in the area. Maud was formed in 1870. Atlanta was
founded in 1871, and it, along with Douglassville, was an economic center for the surrounding
rural community (Hazlewood 2010; Harper 2010c).
The entire area remained primarily rural with an agricultural economy, but small manufacturing
also employed some of the local population. The Depression had a devastating effect on the
area, but World War II brought the establishment of the Red River Army Depot and the Lone
Star Army Ammunition Plant, which increasingly employed many of the local residents from
that point forward (Harper 2010b). Changes in the economic market drew many people away
from farming and into manufacturing and trade. However, populations grew slowly, if at all,
and the inhabitants remained relatively poor. Wright Patman Lake was completed in 1957 and
provided recreation facilities as well as flood control measures.

Chapter 3

Methods
The archeological field inventory was conducted in six field sessions: October 28–November 6,
2009, November 11–20, 2009, December 3–10, 2009, January 5–8, 2010, March 23–26, 2010, and
May 12–13, 2010. In all, 144 person-days were spent in the field. Methods and density of shovel
testing complied with or exceeded the minimum requirements for field tactics stipulated by the
USACE (2007).

3.1	Survey Tactics
For each parcel, a logistical plan was prepared in advance using ArcGIS to determine the
number of shovel tests per transect needed to obtain the coverage goal. Each field archeologist
was given a copy of both aerial and USGS topographic views of the parcel and was assigned
a transect line and a targeted number of shovel tests. Transect lines were designated with an
alpha-numeric prefix, and individual shovel tests along each transect line were numbered so
that shovel test “7E-4” identified the fourth test along the seventh transect of the fifth day of
the project. In general, each crew member followed his/her own transect, walking parallel with
the other crew members. Occasionally, for logistical reasons, two crew members doubled up
with one person digging the shovel tests and another screening and recording the field forms,
or two or more surveyors would “leapfrog” along one transect, each digging alternating shovel
tests. Surveyors were given flexibility to place their shovel tests in likely locations such as
topographic rises, rather than at set intervals.
Recent debris such as aluminum cans, beer bottles and plastic detritus was commonly observed,
but no further attention was paid to such items clearly less than 50 years old.
Special effort was made to relocate the previously recorded sites in four of the parcels. For
these sites, the field crew used multiple lines of evidence to ascertain the location (or suspected
location) of the site. The crew referred to the site’s plot on the USGS topographic maps at
TARL, to the original site sketch map (when on file at TARL), and to the UTM (or latitude/
longitude) coordinates of the site. Allowances were made for possible conversion errors in
coordinate systems, and for possible map plotting errors. At each suspected location(s), the
crew conducted a pedestrian inspection of the vicinity. If no surface evidence of the site was
seen, the crew shovel tested the most probable location(s) based on the above lines of evidence.
At all shovel tests, GPS readings were taken to verify transect and shovel test locations.
Tests were selectively placed on landforms shown by previous research to be preferred site
locations, such as ridge lines, knolls, and promontories. In some cases, shovel tests could not
be dug due to standing water, erosion, or steep slopes, and these locations were individually
recorded on the shovel testing log. Areas of obvious deep disturbance, such as those affected
by bulldozing, were noted on the field maps and were excluded from shovel testing. Similarly,
Ecological Communications Corporation

49

Chapter 3

Methods

areas that were completely inundated were
excluded from transect coverage, including
low swampy areas, ponds, and all areas
underneath current lake levels (Figure 3-1).
All shovel tests were 30–35 cm in diameter
and were dug to the bottom of the Holocene
deposits as indicated by clay, or to 80 cmbs if
no clay was present. Tests were individually
recorded with regard to depth, soil type and
color, and cultural material present. Tests
were dug in natural stratigraphic levels
not exceeding 20 cm in thickness, and all
excavated material was screened through
¼-inch (6.4 mm) stainless steel mesh.

Figure 3-1. High water over the boat
ramp in Overlook Park, facing north.

All cultural material was collected with
the exception of recent objects such as
bottle glass shards, nails, and aluminum
pop-tabs. These were assumed to indicate
recent disturbance and were not collected.
The exceptions to this collection policy
include the investigations of sites 41AG207,
41AG208, 41NA335, 41SB374, and
41SB375. All shovel tests were backfilled.

Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in
the immediate vicinity at 5–15 m distances up to nine tests in an area. If more than one of
these tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found in any single test, then the
location was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive test was designated as an isolated
occurrence. The coordinates of isolates were plotted and the artifacts were collected, but these
were not further recorded. The recorded locations of previously recorded sites were similarly
investigated using multiple shovel tests.
On each site a permanent site datum was established using a 12-inch iron rebar fixed with an
aluminum survey tag. Tags were embossed with:
ECOMM 046-030
USACE FS###
On each tag, “FS” designates Field Site and was followed by a temporary site number for
newly recorded sites. Previously recorded sites were marked using their existing trinomial
designations. A photograph was taken of each datum, for ease of locating them in the future.

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,783 Acres at
Lake O’ the Pines, Sam Rayburn Reservoir, and Wright Patman Lake

Site boundaries were delineated by excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to identify zones
of zero or low artifact presence. Based on the distribution of negative shovel tests or absence
of surface artifacts, site boundaries were marked with pink-glo flagging tape when tree cover
allowed on-site Global Positioning System (GPS) mapping; otherwise, shovel test locations
were used to delineate site boundaries in the lab using ArcGIS. Sites were photographed
and mapped using a Trimble GeoXT sub-meter GPS and were recorded using State of Texas
Archeological Site Data Forms. All excavated artifacts were recovered and were processed and
analyzed in EComm’s Austin laboratory. All artifacts, notes, and records will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) upon completion of analysis.

3.2	Density of Shovel Testing
The contractual scope of work issued by the USACE specified that at a minimum, one shovel
test was to be excavated per three acres (equivalent to 0.33 tests per acre). Using this rate of
coverage, a total of 597 shovel tests was the minimum required to inventory the 1,783 acres
(Table 3-1). In an attempt to ensure greater coverage than this minimum, certain high-probability
areas were tested at a rate of 1–1.5 shovel tests per acre. These areas were mainly knolls, ridges
and other high landforms on the USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangles. In sum, 1,228 shovel
tests were actually excavated while on transect, or more than double the contractual minimum.

The lowest coverage was 0.45 tests per acre at Compartment 7A at Sam Rayburn Reservoir,
and the greatest coverage was 1.13 tests per acre at Johnson Creek Park at Lake O’ the Pines.
For the project as a whole, final coverage averaged about 0.69 transect shovel tests per acre.
Further, 332 additional shovel tests were dug on newly discovered sites, in search of previously
recorded sites, and/or around isolated occurrences. Combining the 1,228 tests on transect and
the 332 tests on sites, 1,560 shovel tests was excavated, or more than 0.87 tests per acre.
Appendix A provides maps of all transect shovel test locations by parcel, and the data from all
1,560 shovel tests are presented in Appendix B.

3.3

Archival Research

Following field work, archival research was conducted on all sites whose archeological
evidence dated to the historic period. The purpose of the archival research was to identify
historically notable persons possibly associated with each site. Initial archival research was
carried out by examining the primary sources in the deed, land title, and probate records. This
research was conducted in Lufkin, Texas for Angelina County, in Jefferson for Marion County,
in Nacogdoches for Nacogdoches County, and in Hemphill for Sabine County; no historic-period
sites were discovered in San Augustine County. The landowners, their heirs, assigns, and grantees
were identified and their presence in the area during the period of interest was verified through
United States Census data.
The identified persons were then further researched for historic significance. Individuals of
historic significance were defined as those who have merited an individual listing in The
Handbook of Texas Online published by the Texas State Historical Association and the General
Libraries of The University of Texas at Austin. If a person of historical significance was in
any way associated with the properties, capsule biography information was compiled and
the nature of the person’s relationship with the area and the tracts was further researched to
determine the level of the person’s involvement. Persons residing on a piece of property and/or
actively participating in its development were determined to be significantly associated with the
property. Persons owning a piece of property but not residing there nor actively participating
in its development (i.e., absentee owners) were determined to be not significantly associated
with the property.

3.4	Evaluation of Significance
The NHPA of 1966, as amended, [16 USC 470 et seq.] created the NRHP to preserve and
protect important aspects of our nation’s cultural heritage. Among other actions, the Act directs
federal agencies to assume responsibility for the preservation of historic properties located
on their land or controlled by them, and further stipulates that such agencies must take into
account the effects of their actions on cultural resources. Pursuant to this direction, agencies
are required to locate, inventory, and nominate to the Secretary of the Interior all properties
owned or under their control that appear to qualify for nomination to the NRHP. Eligibility for
nomination to the NRHP is restricted to properties that are significant and possess integrity as
defined in 36 CFR §60.4:
52

United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District

A Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,783 Acres at
Lake O’ the Pines, Sam Rayburn Reservoir, and Wright Patman Lake

The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,
engineering and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures,
and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials,
workmanship, feeling, and association (36 CFR §60.4).
Significance is further defined in four criteria. Cultural resources are considered significant if:
a) they are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
b) they are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c) they embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method
of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high
artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
component may lack individual distinction; or
d) they have yielded, or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory
or history (36 CFR §60.4).
Cultural resources may qualify for inclusion on the NRHP under any of the four evaluation criteria.
In this study, prehistoric sites were evaluated for significance with respect to NHPA Criterion D.
The demonstrated data content of each site was compared to important research contexts. Sites in
good condition and state of preservation and having several data types bearing on one or more of
the research contexts were evaluated as significant under Criterion D. Those sites that were observed to be in poor condition or state of preservation and/or sites with no data types bearing on one
or more of the research contexts were evaluated as not significant. Finally, sites whose expression
could not be satisfactorily investigated using the survey level tactics employed by this study were
classified as being of unknown significance.
Historic sites, in addition to being evaluated under Criterion D as described above, were also
evaluated with respect to Criterion B. Because none of the historic sites retained any architectural
elements, Criterion C was not applicable. Similarly, none of the sites are associated with important
historical events and so Criterion A was not applicable.

Results at Lake O’ the Pines
Six parcels totaling 398 acres were investigated at Lake O’ the Pines. Within the six parcels,
two new archeological sites were discovered and documented. The location of one previously
recorded site was investigated. In addition, two isolated occurrences were encountered and
investigated.

4.1

Alley Creek Park

The Alley Creek Park parcel totaled 72 acres and was inventoried using 64 transect shovel
tests, for a density of 0.89 shovel tests per acre. No cultural resource sites were found within
the parcel, although one isolated occurrence was documented and investigated with five shovel
tests. Figure 4-1 shows a typical landscape in the park, including cleared underbrush, picnic
tables, and RV pads. The locations and results of all shovel tests excavated within the Alley
Creek parcel are presented in Appendices A and B.

4.1.1 Isolated Occurrence
One isolated occurrence was present in the
Alley Creek Park parcel. A historic shell button
(Figure 4-2) was recovered from the surface
near Shovel Test (ST) 8A-2. Five shovel tests
were excavated in the area; due to the design
of the RV Park, no more shovel tests could
be fit into the area. All five shovel tests were
negative. As a result this location is considered
an isolated occurrence.

4.2	Johnson Creek Park

Figure 4-2. Historic shell button recovered
in Alley Creek Park near ST 8A-2.

The Johnson Creek Park parcel totaled 80
acres. It was inventoried using 90 transect
shovel tests, for a net density of 1.13 shovel tests per acre. One cultural resource site
(41MR270) was present and was investigated with six additional shovel tests. The locations
and results of all shovel tests excavated within the Johnson Creek Park parcel are presented
in Appendices A and B. Maps showing the locations of archeological sites and the State of
Texas Archeological Data Site Forms are presented in restricted access Appendices C and D.

4.2.1 Site 41MR270
Site 41MR270 (Figures 4-3 and 4-4) is a 32 x 25-m site of Archaic age on the northern
end of Johnson Creek Park. The site has an elevation of about 228 ft amsl (69.5 m amsl).
As the area is part of an RV
park, it is lightly covered in
sweetgum and oak trees with
no undergrowth. Soils within
the site are Cuthbert series.
Prior to EComm’s survey the
site area was impacted by the
construction of new RV pads
and a road. The construction
also involved the removal of an
RV pad that was located inside
of the site boundary, leaving a
loose sand pit on the northern
side of the site. Furthermore,
RV pad and road construction
resulted in much of the area
being filled with red clay soil

which extends into the western
half of site.
Seven shovel tests were
excavated on the site (including
the initial positive transect
shovel test). Three of the tests
were positive for a ubiquity
measure of 43 percent. One
of the positive shovel tests
(ST 7.5) was in the portion of
the site that had been covered
by construction fill, which
demonstrates that the portion
of the site has been capped. A
projectile point with Archaic
attributes was found between
20 and 40 cmbs in ST 7.1.
This point resembles a Motley
type, but has been reworked/
resharpened, thus no definite
identification can be made
(Figure 4-5). In total, one
projectile point and five flakes
were recovered from the site to
depths of 40 cmbs (Table 4-1).

4.5.1 Site 41MR210
Site 41MR210 (Figures
4-9 and 4-10) was recorded
as an artifact scatter on
the northwestern end of a
landform in 1998 (Texas
Historical
Commission
[THC]
1998d).
This
landform had been recently
flooded (Figure 4-11) by
high lake waters and no
artifacts were observed
during EComm’s survey
when the water receded. Six
shovel tests (three of which
were transect shovel tests)
were put in upslope where
some soil still remained,
but all shovel tests were
negative.

plates, cans, and other various refuse. The site has an elevation of about 264 ft amsl (80.5 m
amsl). The area of the clearing is covered in tall grass and some pine saplings, while the area
around the edges and the barrow pit has larger pines and elm trees. The undergrowth is very
dense outside of the clearing due to the amount of light that makes it to the forest floor with no
canopy. Soils within the site are Briley series.
The site is located on a 286-acre parcel that was acquired by the United States of America in
1955 through condemnation proceedings (Marion County Deed Records [MCDR] 194/532).
The land was condemned specifically in order to build the Ferrell’s Bridge dam, creating Lake
O’ the Pines. The owner of the property, Wellborn Cooner, evidently had plans to lease the land
for oil exploration. Subsequent deeds on file at the Marion County courthouse show he did
lease adjacent land (not acquired by the US government) in 1957, and the 1955 condemnation
decision explicitly prohibited any oil exploration from taking place within 1,200 ft of the dam.
The condemnation record noted that all reserved “minerals and rights are subordinated to the
prior right of the United States to construct the…dam (MCDR 194/535).” The legal description
of the condemned tract has it as part of the Morton, Timmons, Coupland, and Abrams surveys,
though 41MR269 is more specifically located on the Morton survey.
It is part of a 100-acre tract known as Block 1 of the Ward Subdivision, which encompassed a
much larger parcel composed of land not only in the Morton, Timmons, Coupland, and Abrams
surveys, but also the Ussery survey stretching along Big Cypress Bayou. A plat of the Ward
Subdivision was made in 1925 (Figure 4-14), though it is evident from references to the plat
found in deeds dating to the 1910s that the land was actually subdivided quite a bit earlier. This

research was unable to determine
when that subdivision was originally
made. In part, this is due to the fact
that Charles Ray, who originally
sold tracts to G. W. Washington and
Wellborn Cooner (Table 4-2), bought
and sold dozens of properties in
Marion County between 1900 and
1947, and the deed indices do not
contain any notes regarding the legal
description of the parcels. The parcel
on which 41MR269 is located was
originally sold to G. W. Washington,
an African American farmer, in 1915.
It is depicted on the 1925 plat as the

a bridge over Big Cypress Bayou ran through the property.
The Washington family lived on this area from before the twentieth century. G. W. Washington,
along with Frank, Henry, William, and David are all listed in the 1910 census, living within
several houses of each other. It is not clear whether they were all related. George and Henry
Washington are also listed as living in adjacent houses in the 1900 census for this area, so it
likely that at least those two men were brothers. In 1900, George was 27 years old and lived
with his wife Virgie and nine brothers and sisters ranging in age from two to 21years in age. By
1910, George and Virigie had five children of their own and five nieces and nephews living with
them. All the Washingtons living in this neighborhood were African Americans who owned the
properties on which they lived. In fact, the census shows that the neighborhood was dominated
by black farmers. The area was once known as Macedonia, an African American community
that in 1938 had a one-room school house, a church, and a cemetery (Odintz 2010). George
W. Washington is buried in the Macedonia cemetery (which may also be on the same 100-acre
parcel owned by Washington), having died in 1944 (Smith 2010).
Welborn Cooner (who was white) bought the property from the heirs of George Washington in
1947. Cooner owned a number of tracts of land in this part of the county, and he leased much
of it for oil exploration.
The archeological remains representing 41MR269 appear to postdate both the Washington
and Cooner periods of ownership. No artifacts or features were identified that relate to the
Washington period of occupation. The site itself consists of a borrow pit filled with tin cans
and bottles with no additional features. Nine shovel tests were excavated in order to assess
site integrity. The single positive shovel test was ST 1, dug in the borrow pit. Only a handful
of artifacts were collected from the site; pieces that would be useful in dating the site and
that were in good condition were kept for curation. The collected artifacts, consisting of three
bottles, a soda can, and a small plate, all date to post-1950 (Table 4-3).

4.6	Copeland Creek Park
The Copeland Creek Park parcel totaled 25 acres and was inventoried using 28 transect shovel
tests, for a density of 1.12 shovel tests per acre. No cultural resource sites were found within
the parcel, although one isolated occurrence was investigated through three shovel tests, all of
which were negative. A typical landscape is shown in Figure 4-15, illustrating the drop-off of
the main landform of the parcel. See Appendices A and B for the locations and results of all
shovel tests excavated within the Copeland Creek parcel.

Results at Sam Rayburn Reservoir
Six parcels totaling 1,324 acres were investigated at Sam Rayburn Reservoir. Within the six
parcels, 21 new archeological sites were discovered and documented and the locations of six
previously recorded sites were investigated.

5.1	Compartment 7A
Compartment 7A totaled 200 acres and was inventoried using 90 transect shovel tests, for a
density of 0.45 shovel tests per acre. Four new cultural resource sites (41SB373, 41SB374,
41SB375, and 41SB376) were recorded and one previously recorded site (41SB48) and
two isolated occurrences were investigated. An additional 56 shovel tests were dug in these
investigations. Previously recorded site 41SB302 was located just outside the boundary of the
parcel, but five shovel tests along that boundary found no evidence of the site extending into
the parcel. A small portion near the southeastern corner of this parcel could not be surveyed
as it was completely surrounded by deep and wide water (Figure 5-1). EComm placed several
shovel tests as close as possible to the area. See Appendices A and B for the locations and
results of all shovel tests excavated within Compartment 7A. Maps showing the locations
of archeological sites and the State of Texas Archeological Data Site Forms are presented in
Appendices C and D.

5.1.1 Site 41SB48
41SB48
(Figure

was recorded by R. L.
Stephenson in 1948 as a
small mound 30 ft (9.14 m)
in diameter, with no artifacts
on or around it, but with
four looter pits. Stephenson
(1948i) interpreted the site
as a burial mound. During
EComm’s
investigations,
no mound was found at the
plotted location, but shovel
tests placed at the site
location of record returned
ceramic and lithic artifacts.
Shovel testing expanded the
site to encompass the entire
landform.

Figure 5-2. Site 41SB48, facing south.

41SB48 now measures 130 x 85 m.
The site has heavy tree cover and
is situated on the shoreline of the
Bear Creek portion of Sam Rayburn
Reservoir. The site has an elevation
of 175 ft amsl (53.3 m amsl). The
typical vegetation in the site is pine,
oak, sweetgum, and ash trees and
greenbrier. Soils within the site
are Mattex-Iulus complex, with
loamy soils. Surface visibility is
approximately 5 percent.
Fourteen shovel tests were
excavated to assess the nature of
the cultural resource deposition and
to delineate the boundaries (Figure
5-3). Twelve of the 14 tests returned
subsurface material, for a ubiquity
measure of 86 percent. One hundred
four lithics and 19 prehistoric
ceramic sherds were recovered
between 0 and 100 cmbs in twelve
of the shovel tests (Table 5-1). In

and 10 mm apart. None of the decorative element
could be attributed to a specific ceramic type. The
remaining sherds, four of which were rims, were all plain with smoothed surfaces. The five
rim sherds can be seen in Figure 5-5 in both plan and profile views. Temper inspection found
10 exclusively grog sherds, six bone/grog sherds, one shell/grog sherd, and one sand temper
sherd. Thickness ranged from 4 to 8 mm, with no obvious correlations to decoration, temper,
or firing. Firing in a reduced atmosphere was predominant on 11 of the sherds, followed by
four sherds with mixed oxidization and reduction, with only three sherds completely oxidized
in cross section. In conclusion, the analysis of 18 ceramic sherds from 41SB48 found evidence
of utilitarian Caddo ceramics. It is possible that the single sand-tempered rim sherd could be
from a Goose Creek Plain vessel. Together with the Friley-like point, this may indicate a Late
Woodland occupation as well as a later Late Caddo occupation.

5.1.2 Site 41SB373
Site 41SB373 (Figure 5-6; see Figure 5-3) is a 125 x 50-m prehistoric site of a Middle to Late
Caddo occupation. It is situated just east of the Bear Creek branch of Sam Rayburn Reservoir.
The site has heavy tree cover and secondary growth. The site has an elevation of about 165 ft
amsl (50.3 m amsl). The typical vegetation in the site is pine, oak, sweetgum, and ash trees and
greenbrier. Soils within the site are Mattex-Iulus complex, with loamy soils. Surface visibility
is approximately 5 percent.
In addition to pedestrian survey, 23 shovel tests were excavated to assess the nature of cultural
resource deposition and site boundaries. Nine of the 23 tests returned subsurface material,
for a ubiquity measure of 39 percent. Sixteen ceramics and 16 lithic artifacts were recovered
between 0 and 100 cmbs (Table 5-2).
The

credited with being one of the early skirmishes leading up to the Texas Revolution. (Ericson
2008) and was a delegate at the convention at San Felipe in 1833. It is not clear for how long
or whether Johnson even lived on his league. He began selling portions of it in prior to 1842
(see site 41SB375, below).
By 1870. G. W. Mays owned 300 acres out of the northern portion of the league (Table 5-3).
Mays is listed in the 1870 federal census of Sabine County as living near Brookeland with his
wife Mary and daughter Ida. Mays was 26 years old, Mary was 21, and Ida was 3. Mays sold
300 acres to Samuel D. McClelland in 1879. Born in 1830 in Mississippi, it is not clear when
McClelland came to Texas. S. D. McClelland and his wife Thirsey (or possibly Tharsday)
are listed in the 1880 federal census for Sabine County, and they undoubtedly lived on their
property. McClelland died in Brookeland in 1895 and is buried in the Brookeland cemetery
along with his wife (McKary 2010). At some point, McClelland subdivided his property into
a number of smaller parcels. Many of them were six-acre parcels, though some encompassed
20 acres. McClelland reserved 100 acres for himself. When McClelland died, this eventually
became the home of his oldest son, Samuel N. He is listed in the 1900 federal census as a
44-year old farmer living with his wife, Ada (age 33), and six children. When Ada died, he
remarried and had at least one other child. He also earned income by selling timber on their
property, evidenced by a 1903 deed made to the T. B. Allen Timber Company (Sabine County
Deed Records [SCDR] R/124).
Samuel began selling the smaller land parcels around 1914, after his mother Thirsey passed
away. One of his earlier sales was a 20-acre tract to his son Calvin M. and Calvin’s new
bride, Elizabeth. The couple eventually had five children before Calvin died in 1928. Samuel
McClelland also sold additional parcels to Calvin, and as his other children grew to adulthood,
he sold parcels to them too. During the period of 1910–1920, Samuel McClelland also sold
tracts to non-family members, as evidenced by multiple deeds on record at the Sabine County
Clerk’s Office.
The McClelland family appears to have been close knit, and most of the family members
remained in the Brookeland area. There are dozens of McClellands buried in the Brookeland
Cemetery, including Samuel N., his first and second wives, many of his children, and Calvin
McClelland (McKary 2010).

over 5 ft at the level that has been filled in by soil. The removed cap of the cistern measures 3 ft
high and has an internal diameter of 3 ft at the top with 4-inch-thick walls. Feature 2 is similar
to Feature 1 but lacks the above ground component. The surface diameter of the cistern is 3 ft
and the interior diameter at the level of soil fill is approximately 5 ft. The sediment partially
filling the cisterns could not be safely tested during the survey.
In addition to the initial positive transect shovel test, three of the additional five shovel tests
at the site were positive for buried cultural material, returning 51 pieces of historic debris to

depths of 60 cmbs (Tables 5-4 and 5-5). The debris found in the shovel tests and around the
cisterns reflect a domestic occupation. The artifacts consist of kitchen and home debris that
probably post-date the 1920s. There is an abundance of clear, arsenic-bleached glass that was
produced after World War II; bottle crown caps also reflect the period after 1906, although the
specimens from 41SB374 probably date later than that. Most of the artifacts have no diagnostic
markings on them that would help identify place or time range of manufacture.

5.1.4 Site 41SB375
Site 41SB375 (Figures 10 and 11) is a 75 x 55-m historic site located near the Bear Creek
branch of Sam Rayburn Reservoir. The site has an elevation of about 195 ft amsl (59.4 m
amsl), and the area is moderately wooded with a mixed hardwood overstory and a scrubby
understory of vines. Soils within the area are Laneville series. Surface visibility in the area is
approximately 10 percent.
The site’s land ownership history is summarized in Table 5-6. The site is on land that was
originally part of a league granted to Achilles E. C. Johnson, who was one of Zavala’s colonists.
He was a participant in the Battle of Nacogdoches in 1832, which is credited with being one
of the early skirmishes leading up to the Texas Revolution. (Ericson 2008), and was a delegate
at the convention at San Felipe in 1833. Johnson sold one-quarter of his league to Alison A.
Lewis, though it is not clear when that sale took place. Confirmation of the sale was recorded in
1842, though it is clear from a second sale that Alison Lewis sold the same land to P. A. Sublett
in 1841 (SCDR F/539). That sale was not actually recorded with the County Clerk until 1888. P.
A. Sublett, an early settler of San Augustine and also a participant in the Battle of Nacogdoches,
probably never lived on this land. He died in 1850 in San Augustine (Cutrer 2010). In 1871, his
heirs sold 200 acres out of the Johnson tract to J. R. Bell, a farmer from Kentucky. Though Bell
officially owned the land in
1871, census records suggest
he may have occupied it
since before 1860. His name
appears in the federal census
for 1860 as a resident of
Sabine County, living on
“Bare” Creek with his wife,
Julia, and their six children.
In 1860, Bell was 39 years
old. He also appears in the
1880 census. His four grown
sons, George, John Henry,
Frank, and Luther, lived in
adjoining households. Bell
acquired additional property

When Bell died in his home
in 1904, he was buried in the
Brookeland Cemetery next
to his wife, who had died a
year before. The heirs of J.
R. Bell granted the original
200-acre homestead tract to
the oldest son George, who
continued to live on and farm
it. Other members of the Bell
family also continued to live
nearby. George died in 1933
at the age of 86. Like so many
other members of the Bell
family, he was buried in the
Brookeland Cemetery (there
are more than 60 members of
the Bell family buried there).

Clerk’s Office indicating that the Lakeys and the Bells were doing business with each other by
the early twentieth century. When Bob Lakey and his wife Zilla sold the Bell homestead to the
United States of America in 1961, the deed specified that one house, a smokehouse, two sheds,
an outhouse, a barn, and a garage were to be removed.

recovered on the surface and from shovel tests reflect a potentially wide date range (Table 5-7),
but generally reflect the period after 1900.
An opaque white and red marble is possibly an agateware marble, made from porcelain. These
have a date range of about 1850–1920 (Carskadden and Gartley 1990; Zapata 1997), which
does overlap with the period during which the Bell Family owned the property encompassing
the site. A fruit or preserves jar with a Hazel Atlas mark post-dates 1923. Two very corroded
nails and a clear glass (possibly medicine bottle) fragment provide little additional dating
information.
Three features were recorded. Feature 1 (see Figure 5-10) is a subsurface concrete well made
of concrete pipes, 30 inches in diameter, stacked vertically. The well is five courses deep, each
course being 31 inches, but has been filled with soil and brush; the original depth cannot be
determined. Feature 2 is a metal box set into the ground with a lid. When the lid is removed, a
series of pipes and a gauge is apparent. The purpose of the gauge is unknown, but it resembles
a modern propane gauge. Feature 3 is a 1.5-inch-diameter pipe sticking vertically out of the
ground 19 inches.

Site
41SB376
(Figures
5-12 and 5-13) is a
240 x 65-m prehistoric site
of undetermined age. It is
situated on a peninsula just
east of the Bear Creek branch
of Sam Rayburn Reservoir.
The site has heavy tree cover
and secondary growth. The
site has an elevation of about
164 ft amsl (50 m amsl).
The typical vegetation in the
site is oak and sweetgum,
with vines and greenbrier in
thick clumps. Soils within
the site are Mattex-Iulus
complex, with loamy soils.
This area floods occasionally, as
there is a large buoy in the middle
of the peninsula. Surface visibility
is approximately 5 percent.

One primary flake was recovered from ST 27FA-1 on transect. Surrounding this test, three
more shovel tests were excavated (because the location was surrounded by water, additional
shovel tests could not be excavated). All of these additional shovel tests were negative, and so
the locus is considered an isolated occurrence.

5.3	Compartment 15B
Compartment 15B totaled 239 acres and was inventoried using 183 transect shovel tests, for
a net density of 0.77 shovel tests per acre. Seven cultural resource sites (41SA302, 41SA303,
41SA304, 41SA305, 41SA306, 41SA307, and 41SA308) were recorded and six isolated
occurrences were investigated. An additional 92 shovel tests were used in these investigations.
See Appendices A and B for the locations and results of all shovel tests excavated Compartment
15B. Maps showing the locations of archeological sites and the State of Texas Archeological
Data Site Forms are presented in Appendices C and D.

5.3.1 Site 41SA302
Site 41SA302 (Figures 5-15 and
5-16) is a 35 x 30-m prehistoric
site of undetermined age. It is
situated on a low flat landform 30
m east of the Ayish Bayou branch
of Sam Rayburn Reservoir. The
site has sparse tree cover and
little secondary growth. The site
has an elevation of about 170 ft
amsl (51.8 m amsl), barely above
the floodplain of Sam Rayburn
Reservoir. The typical vegetation
in the site is pine, oak, and holly
trees. Soils within the site are
Metcalf-Sawtown complex, with
loamy clay. Surface visibility is
approximately 5 percent.
In addition to pedestrian survey,
11 shovel tests were excavated
to assess the nature of cultural
resource deposition and site
boundaries. Of these 11 tests (two
of which were transect shovel
tests), only three were positive
for subsurface cultural material,
for a net ubiquity measure of 27
percent (Table 5-9). Three lithic
flakes were recovered between
40 and 80 cmbs.

5.3.2 Site 41SA303
Site 41SA303 (Figures 5-17 and 5-18) is a 300 x 60-m prehistoric site of Caddoan age situated
on a peninsula east of the Ayish Bayou branch of Sam Rayburn Reservoir. The site has heavy
tree cover and secondary growth. The site has an elevation of about 165 ft amsl (50.3 m
amsl). The typical vegetation in the site is pine, oak, sweetgum, and ash trees and greenbrier.
Soils within the site are Guyton-Sawtown complex, with loamy soils. Surface visibility is
approximately 5 percent.
In addition to pedestrian survey, 24 shovel tests (four on transect) were excavated to assess the
nature of cultural resource deposition and site boundaries. Thirty-one items were recovered
between 0 and 80 cmbs in 18 of the 24 shovel tests excavated (75% ubiquity).
One projectile point resembling a Catahoula or possibly a Friley (Figure 5-19), one ceramic
sherd, one biface fragment, one piece of red ochre, and 27 pieces of lithic debitage were
recovered. The ceramic sherd is a plain rim sherd with grog temper, seen in Figure 5-20 in both
plan and profile views, and in Appendix E. Sherd thickness was only 5 mm with a smoothed
exterior surface. Firing environment provided oxidized exterior and interiors of the sherd and
a reduced core. The vertical distribution of artifacts was strongly unimodal at 40–60 cmbs,
suggesting a single, intact, buried component (Table 5-10).

has an elevation of about 165 ft amsl (50.3 m amsl). The typical vegetation in the site is oak
and pine trees. Soils within the site are Guyton-Sawtown complex, with loamy soils. Surface
visibility is approximately 5 percent.
In addition to pedestrian survey, eight shovel tests (including two on transect) were excavated
to assess the nature of cultural resource deposition and to delineate site boundaries. Three of
the eight shovel tests were positive (38% ubiquity), returning. seven lithics between 20 and 60
cmbs (Table 5-13).

5.3.8 Isolated Occurrences
Within Compartment 15B, six isolated occurrences were investigated.
One primary flake was recovered from ST 10M-2. Eight shovel tests were excavated in
radial directions; all eight tests were negative.
Historic ceramics were recovered in STs 0Z-3 and 0Z-5. No artifacts or features were
observed on the surface. Four additional shovel tests were excavated in the area, but all were
negative. Both loci are considered isolated occurrences.
One piece of lithic shatter was recovered from ST 4Z-2; five shovel tests were excavated on
neighboring mounds. All five additional shovel tests were negative.
One primary flake was recovered from ST 9AA-2; four shovel tests were excavated in radial
directions (additional shovel test were precluded as the locus had water on one side and the
project boundary on the other). All four additional shovel tests were negative.
One primary flake was recovered from ST 10AA-2; four shovel tests were excavated in radial
directions (additional shovel test were precluded as the locus was surrounded by water). All
four additional shovel tests were negative.

5.4	Compartment 23
Compartment 23 totaled 246 acres and was inventoried using 144 transect shovel tests, for
a net density of 0.59 shovel tests per acre. This parcel contained four newly discovered
cultural resource sites (41NA332, 41NA333, 41NA334, and 41NA335) and three
previously recorded sites (41NA14, 41NA67, and 41NA132). Two isolated occurrences
were also investigated. An additional 59 shovel tests were used in these investigations.
See Appendices A and B for the locations and results of all shovel tests excavated in
Compartment 23. Maps showing the locations of archeological sites and the State of Texas
Archeological Data Site Forms are presented in Appendices C and D.

5.4.1 Site 41NA14
41NA14 was recorded in 1974 by T. E. Mayhew as a Caddo and historic-period site
that had been destroyed by erosion from Sam Rayburn Reservoir. He recorded several
prehistoric and historic ceramics as well as two lithic projectiles and several other tools
(Mayhew 1974). The site was again recorded by Carey Weber in 1980 as a Pre-Caddo to
historic-period site with several hundred lithics and approximately 75 prehistoric ceramics
(Weber 1980e).

Lake O’ the Pines, Sam Rayburn Reservoir, and Wright Patman Lake

Site 41NA14 measures 70 x 50-m (Figures 5-30 and 5-31) and is almost completely
disturbed. The site has an elevation of 165 ft amsl (50.3 m amsl). The site only has tree
cover and secondary growth in small pockets around the edge of the large parking and
camping area. The trees are pine and holly with dense briar at the forest floor. Soils for the
site are Attoyac series, with fine sandy loam soils. Surface visibility is approximately 30
percent on the low areas of the site near the water and almost non-existent elsewhere due
to leaf litter.
Seven shovel tests were excavated inside the project boundaries at the point nearest the
centroid marked on the THC Atlas. The area tested is mostly a cleared and compacted area
for camping and hunting; as such, shovel tests were placed in the undisturbed pockets
spread around the site. Clay was reached in all tests at fairly shallow depths, ranging
from 20 to 60 cmbs. Three of the seven tests were positive for a ubiquity measure of 43
percent, returning 28 prehistoric lithic artifacts between 0 and 60 cmbs (Table 5-16). The
assemblage consisted of 20 primary flakes, two secondary flakes, seven tertiary flakes, and
one piece of shatter.

5.4.2 Site 41NA67
Site 41NA67 was recorded in 1973 by T. E. Mayhew (1973a). He mentions that the site was
first discovered in 1971, and that in the two years since initial discovery more than half of
the site had been destroyed by lake erosion. The site was recorded as an Archaic to Caddo
affiliation with hundreds of sherds and lithics recovered.
The site now measures about 30 x 30-m and has a 2–3-m escarpment (Figure 5-32) on the
southern edge where erosion has eaten away the site. The site has an elevation of about 170 ft
amsl (51.8 m amsl). It has moderate tree cover and little secondary growth; typical vegetation
in the site is pine and holly trees. Soils within the site are Attoyac series, with fine sandy loam
soils. Surface visibility is less than five percent.
Seven shovel tests were excavated in order to assess the nature of the cultural resource deposition
and delineate the site boundaries (Figure 5-33). Clay was reached in all tests at fairly shallow
depths, ranging from 20 to 60 cmbs. Only one of the seven tests (ST 1) was positive, for a
ubiquity measure of 14 percent. This test returned two primary flakes and one tertiary flake
between 20 and 40 cmbs. The area below the cliff at the southern end of the site was surveyed
on foot, but no artifacts were found on the surface. An anomalous alignment of clay (Figure
5-34) was noted offshore. The alignment does not appear to be natural; one speculation is that
it may be the remains of clay-filled “sand bags” that had been staked downslope in an attempt
to mitigate further wave erosion of the site.

5.4.3 Site 41NA132
41NA132 (Figure 5-35) is a 225 x 150-m prehistoric site that was first recorded in 1980 by
Carey Weber (1980h) as a “lithic/ceramic” site on the lakeshore at the end of an old road.
The site was again investigated in 1996 by the US Forest Service, who recorded the site as
a “prehistoric open site” (Jurney 1996). Both site records mention that 41NA132 has been
looted; however, no evidence of looting was observed during EComm’s investigation of the
site. Weber suggests that the site has multiple components ranging from “early lithic” to preCaddo/Early Ceramic, with a historic component as well.
The site location has moderate tree cover with little secondary growth and an elevation of
about 175 ft amsl (53.3 m amsl). Typical vegetation in the site is oak, pine, and cypress trees.
Soils within the site are Bernaldo-Besner complex, with loamy soils. Surface visibility is
approximately 5 percent.
In addition to the pedestrian survey, 24 shovel tests (including four on transect) were excavated
to assess the nature of cultural resource deposition and delineate site boundaries (Figure 5-36).
Thirteen of the 24 tests were positive, for a ubiquity measure of 54 percent. Subsurface material
was recovered between 0 and 80 cmbs, with a strong unimodal distribution at 0–20 cmbs (Table
5-17). The assemblage consisted of 119 items including one biface, one core, 111 flakes of
chert and silicified wood, two pieces of lithic shatter, and one piece of red ochre. No ceramics
or diagnostic tools were recovered from the investigation, so the previous site dating cannot be
confirmed. Some historic artifacts were recovered, but no historic features were located.

5.4.7 Site 41NA335
Site 41NA335 (Figures 5-43 and 5-44) is a 40 x 25-m historic site located south of a nowprivate road that previously crossed the Attoyac River. The site has an elevation of about 180
ft amsl (54.9 m amsl), and the area is moderately wooded with a mixed hardwood overstory
and a scrubby understory of vines and greenbrier. Soils within the area are Mollville-Besner
complex. Surface visibility in the area is approximately 5 percent.
The site is on land that was originally patented by the heirs of W. W. Malone in 1882 as part
of a 160-acre preemption survey (Table 5-20). William Malone and his wife Mary appear in
both the 1860 and 1870 federal censuses of Nacogdoches County, living the Chireno area,
which is along the Attayac River a few miles north of site 41NA335. Their actual home was
probably the land that later was patented as the Malone survey, Chireno being the closest
town. William Malone was 21 years old in 1860 and his profession was farming; his wife
was 15. In 1870, they had five children. The Malones do not appear in the census records
for Nacogdoches County in 1880, and it seems apparent that both William and Mary must
have died by 1882, since the land was formally patented by the five children. They sold all
of the land to William D. Jackson in 1887. Jackson is listed in the 1880 federal census for

Nacogdoches County as a farmer. He was 45 years old, and lived with his 39-year-old wife,
Mary, and their five children.
If Jackson ever lived on the Malone tract, it was for a short time only. In 1893, he sold the
eastern 121 acres of the property to Benjamin R. Wade and his wife Lizzie. Wade and his wife
were also living in the Chireno area in 1880. B. R. Wade was 30 years old in 1880. He and his
wife had two children at that time—Mary (age 4) and James (age 1). The couple eventually
had seven children who lived to adulthood. B. R. and Lizzie Wade did live on the Malone
survey. They are both listed in 1910 federal census in Nacogdoches County. They lived on
the Broaddus to Broom Ferry Road, and that road is probably the same one that is depicted

maps. At that time they had
two children who lived with
them: William (age 26) and
a daughter named Katie (age
12). Katie is not mentioned
in a list of the heirs of
B. R. and Lizzie Wade
(Nacogdoches County Deed
Records [NCDR] 303/542),
and so it is possible that
she died in childhood.
According to an affidavit
filed by an heir of B. R. and
Lizzie Wade, Lizzie Wade
died in 1918 in Nacogdoches
County (NCDR 303/542).
Benjamin died ten years
later in Cherokee County,
having
abandoned
the
family
farmstead.
The
seven children of the
Wades eventually settled in
different parts of Texas and
Louisiana. They divided the
property among the heirs of
the seven children in 1958,
and sold a large portion of it
to three brothers, Stephen,
Henry, and H. B. Tucker,
for use as the “Tucker
Clinic” (Figure 5-45). The

son of Benjamin and Lizzie Wade’s oldest daughter, Mary. In all likelihood, the land sold
to the Tuckers in 1958 had been vacant, occupied by tenants, or leased to the timber and oil
industries for close to 40 years.
When the Tucker brothers, Henry, Stephen, and Hal, purchased land in the Malone survey,
they were well-known doctors who lived in the City of Nacogdoches (Borders 2006; Ericson
2008). Early in their career Henry and Stephen treated patients in Stephen’s home on Mound
Street, converting the first floor of the house to a clinic (Ericson 2008). Henry Tucker appears
also to have been involved in the development of the Nacogdoches Memorial Hospital and
may have specialized in treating tropical diseases. It is not clear what sort of clinic the Dr.
Tucker hoped to open when they purchased land in the Malone tract in 1958. In any event,
the clinic must have been short-lived, since the US government acquired it in 1963.
The site was first indicated in the field by several large rocks that were out of context. Artifacts
observed on the site surface included two metal wash basins, a rusted sheet of metal, a crumpled
metal bucket, a rusted barrel, and empty metal propane bottles. Six shovel tests were excavated
on the site, of which three were positive. Artifacts found in the shovel tests include a clear glass
unmarked medicine bottle, a plain whiteware plate rim, and one clear glass bottle fragment
(Table 5-21). Clear glass typically indicates a manufacture date later than WWII (Lindsey
2010). Together with the metal basins and propane bottles the artifacts probably reflect the
period between 1940 and 1965 or
so. In addition to the positive shovel

It is not possible to definitely attribute any of these artifacts to the period during which the
Tucker brothers owned the land for use as a clinic, or an earlier occupation, since the artifacts
broadly reflect the 1940s through 1960s. Although it is interesting to note, the medicine bottle
found could reflect the Tucker period.

5.4.8 Isolated Occurrences
Two pieces of historic whiteware were recovered from two different shovel tests in the
northern portion of the parcel. This general area is shown to have four houses or other
structures on the 1958 Broaddus USGS 15’ map. The structures are no longer present having
been razed some time ago, and there is no sign of them above the ground or in shovel tests.
Since these buildings are no longer extant, these two artifacts would not contribute to the
archeological record of the area and are considered isolated occurrences.

5.5.2 Site 41AG161
41AG161 (Figures 5-48

AR Consultants in 1996
as a 22 x 30-m scatter of
lithics and ceramic along
the shoreline with negative
shovel tests (Trask 1996d).
EComm investigated the
location plotted on the THC
Atlas with six shovel tests
and a visual survey of the
shoreline, but recovered no
artifacts. No site is present
at the location on record.

However, the likelihood
is very slim that this site
is truly located at a UTM
position ending with double zeros
on both the northing and easting;
rather, it is more likely that the
UTM coordinates were rounded and
that this is not the location that was
observed in 1996.

Site 41AG205 (Figures 5-50 and

of undetermined age situated on a
low hill north of the Popher Creek
arm of Sam Rayburn Reservoir. The
site has sparse tree cover and little
secondary growth. The site has an
elevation of about 164 ft amsl (50 m
amsl), barely above the floodplain
of Sam Rayburn. The typical
vegetation in the site is pine, oak,
sweetgum, and holly trees. Soils
within the site are Rosenwall series,
with shallow clay. Surface visibility
is approximately 5 percent.

In addition to pedestrian survey, seven shovel tests were excavated to assess the nature of
cultural resource deposition and to delineate site boundaries. Clay was encountered at shallow
depths in all tests, ranging from 20 to 60 cmbs. One test was positive. Two lithic flakes and one
piece of lithic shatter were recovered between 0 and 20 cmbs.

5.5.4 Site 41AG206
Site 41AG206 (Figures 5-52 and 5-53) is a prehistoric site of Late Caddo age measuring about
130 x 70-m. It is situated on two high mounds on the shoreline north of the Popher Creek arm
of Sam Rayburn Reservoir. The site has moderate tree cover and several dense thickets of briar
and vine, but is otherwise open. The site has an elevation of about 170 ft amsl (51.8 m amsl);
the areas between and around the mounds are barely above the floodplain of Sam Rayburn. The
typical vegetation in the site is pine, oak, sweetgum, and cypress trees. Soils within the site are
Alazan series, with deep clay. Surface visibility is approximately 5 percent.
In addition to pedestrian survey, 19 shovel tests were excavated to assess the nature of cultural
resource deposition and to delineate site boundaries. Ten of the 19 shovel tests were positive,
for a ubiquity measure of 53 percent. Cultural material was recovered at the surface and in
each level down to 120 cmbs, with
a strong unimodal peak in artifact
frequency between 60 and 100 cmbs.
The recovered assemblage totaled
104 items including 16 ceramics,
one lithic core, 82 lithic flakes of
chert and silicified wood, two pieces
of lithic shatter, and three pieces of
ochre (Table 5-22).
The ceramic sample included 15
body sherds and one very small
sherdlet that was not analyzed (see
Appendix E). Sherd sizes ranged
from 15 to 45 mm, with seven of
the sherds 25 mm in size or greater.
Decorative elements were found
on the exterior of ten of the sherds:
nine brushed (three sherds were
refit) and one with two rectangular
punctations. None of the decorative
elements could be attributed to a
specific ceramic type. The remaining
five sherds were plain with smoothed
surfaces. Temper inspection found
13 exclusively grog sherds, one bone
sherd, one sand/grog sherd, and one

decoration, temper, or firing. Firing in an oxidized atmosphere was predominant on nine (61%)
of the sherds, followed by three sherds with mixed oxidization and reduction, and only three
sherds mostly reduced in cross section. In conclusion, the analysis of 15 ceramic sherds from
41AG206 found evidence of utilitarian Caddoan ceramics.

5.5.5 Site 41AG207
Site 41AG207 (Figures 5-54 and 5-54) is a 110 x 75-m historic site located at the intersection
of two roads inside of Monterrey Park. The site has an elevation of about 185 ft amsl (56.4
m amsl), and the area is moderately wooded with a mixed hardwood overstory and a scrubby
understory of vines and greenbrier. Soils within the area are Alazan-Besner complex. Surface
visibility in the area is approximately 5 percent.
Sites 41AG207 and 41AG208 (see below) are within the same 59.5-acre tract of land granted
to the United State in 1960 by Jim Smith and his wife Zella (Table 5-23). The deed specified a
number of structures that were on the property, which the sellers had the right to remove within
a month of the sale. These included: a dwelling, a smokehouse, a root cellar, an outhouse, a
water tank, a chicken coop, two 10 x 12-ft chicken houses, several barns, two wells (one for
the main house and one for a tenant
house), a calf shed, and two generic
sheds.
In 1960, Jim Smith was 85 years old
and his wife Zella was 77. They had
been living on the property since
1909, when they first purchased 80
acres (in two 40-acre tracts) from the
heirs of Matthew Colwell. The first
40-acre tract was purchased from
J. B. Pickard and his wife Priscilla,
who was a daughter of Matthew and
Martha Colwell. The second 40-acre
tract was purchased from Colwell’s
widow Martha and his son, Sam.
The second tract encompasses the
original Colwell homestead.

the 1870 federal census lists Matthew and Martha living with seven children, the oldest of
which was 20. It is unlikely that he was the son of the then 31-year old Martha. The 1870 census
indicates that the Colwells were living in Angelina County in the Pennington P. O. vicinity.
Their seven children included John (age 20), Wilie (age 14), Caroline (age 11), Priscilla (age
9), Eliza (age 7), William (age 5), and James (age 1). Also living in the same household was a
woman named Marie McNeal and her daughter Martha. It is possible that she was a sister of
Martha Colwell.
By 1880, Matthew and Martha had added three additional children to their family, Ann (age
9), Sarah (age 6), and Alabama (age 4). The Colwell family continues to appear in the federal
censuses for Angelina County through 1900. As the children aged, many of them continued
to reside in neighboring households. For instance, Wilie Colwell and his wife Rachel appear
in a neighboring household in 1880. In 1900, Martha, who was by that time a widow, lived
with her daughter Alabama and her husband. John Colwell, the oldest son of Matthew, lived
in a nearby household, and Martha and Matthew’s daughter Priscilla, who was then married
to J. B. Pickard, lived next to John and his family. After Jim Smith acquired 80 acres of the
original Colwell grant in 1909, many members of the Colwell family continued to reside on the
original Colwell land. The Smiths appear in the 1920 census living in the household adjacent to
J. B. Pickard and his wife Priscilla (né Colwell). John and James Colwell also lived nearby, in
addition to a number of other Colwells who may have been their sons. All listed their profession
as general farming.
Twelve shovel tests were excavated on the site, of which four were positive (33% ubiquity).
Fifty-nine artifacts were recovered; of these 57 were from the upper 40 cmbs (Table 5-24).
With the exception of a 1916 nickel found in ST 2, most of the artifacts offer no time-diagnostic

information that would allow them to be attributed to either the Smith or Colwell occupations.
They broadly reflect an occupation during the late nineteenth century through 1940s. The
aqua fruit jar fragments found in ST 10 at site 41AG207 could date to the late nineteenth
century, though without any other diagnostic manufacturer’s marks or details it is impossible
to determine with any certainty. The remaining artifacts probably reflect the 1900–1940s.
Six features were recorded. Feature 1 is a subsurface concrete well made of pipes, 30 inches
in diameter, stacked vertically. The well is 51 inches deep but has been obviously filled with
soil; the original depth cannot be determined. Feature 2 is a 25 x 30 ft depression in forest floor
about a foot deep, with noticeably softer soil than the surrounding areas. Feature 3 is an old US
Government Property line sign and a pile of scrap metal from a vehicle. Feature 4 is another
well, similar to Feature 1, but has been filled to 15 inches below grade. Feature 5 is a C-shaped
concrete chimney foundation measuring 72 x 42 inches with a 46 x 24-inch cutout on the west
side that is lined with a course of red brick. Feature 6 is similar to Features 1 and 4, but has an
above-ground cap that tapers the 30-inch well down to 17 x 24 inches.
Together, sites 41SA207 and 41SA208 represent the remains of the Smith farmstead, which
may in turn have been the original homestead of Matthew and Martha Colwell, as deed records
suggest. The artifacts and features found at 41AG207 reflect a domestic occupation. Feature 5
at site 41AG207 probably represents the remains of the Colwell house, later occupied by the
Smiths. Feature 2 at the same site is probably the root cellar mentioned in the deed transfer
from the Smiths to the United States government. The octagonal structure at 41AG208 (see
below) may represent the foundation of the water tank also mentioned in the deed transfer.

5.5.6 Site 41AG208
Site 41AG208 (Figures 5-56 and 5-57) is a historic structure located along an old road; it
measures about 30 x 25-m. The site is 250 m east of Sam Rayburn Reservoir. The structure has
an elevation of about 180 ft amsl (54.9 m amsl), and the area is moderately wooded with a mixed
hardwood overstory and a scrubby understory of vines and greenbrier. Soils in the area are

From the platform, a ramp
starting out at the level of
the floor descends into the
trough with a slope of 1 inch drop to every 2 inches of run. The trough reaches at least 7 ft
4 inches deep at the end opposite the platform, although the bottom is likely covered by an
unknown depth of mud and debris. The far end of the trough is a vertical wall with the top
rounded over connecting to an 18-inch-wide strip of concrete. At the start of the narrow strip
are three steps, each 15 inches long with a rise of 2 inches. Past the steps the strip extends an
additional 24 ft in the same direction before stopping where a tree has grown. To the south of
the structure is a mound measuring about 2 m wide, 4 m long, and about 1 m high. This pile
is thought to be the spoil pile from the excavation of the trough. To the north of the structure
is an H-bar for an old barbed wire fence.

Site 41AG210 (Figures 5-60 and
5-61) is a 30 x 20-m prehistoric
site of undetermined age. It is
situated on a high lone hill on
the shore line of Sam Rayburn
Reservoir at an elevation of
about 165 ft amsl (50.3 m amsl),
barely above the flood pool of
Sam Rayburn. The site has
moderate tree cover but heavy
secondary growth at the crest of
the hill. The typical vegetation
in the site is pine, oak,
sweetgum, and holly trees and
vines. Soils within the site are
Alazan-Besner complex, with
loamy soils. Surface visibility is
approximately 5 percent.
In addition to pedestrian
survey, ten shovel tests were
excavated to assess the nature
of cultural resource deposition
and delineate site boundaries.
Only one test was positive, for a
ubiquity measure of 10 percent.
Two lithic flakes were recovered
between 0 and 20 cmbs in ST 15Q-2.

5.5.9 Isolated Occurrences
One tertiary flake was recovered from ST 11N-1. Five shovel tests were excavated in radial
directions (additional shovel tests were precluded as the locus had water on one side and the
project boundary on the other); all five tests were negative.
One tertiary flake was recovered from ST 14N-1. Eight shovel tests were excavated in radial
directions. All eight additional tests were negative.
One tertiary flake was recovered from ST 3O-2. Eight shovel tests were excavated in radial
directions. All eight additional tests were negative.

Results at Wright Patman Lake
Three parcels totaling 61 acres were investigated at Wright Patman Lake. Within the three
parcels the location of one previously recorded site was investigated; no new archeological
sites were discovered.

6.1	Jackson Creek
The Jackson Creek parcel totaled 25 acres and was inventoried using 16 shovel tests for a
density of 0.64 shovel tests per acre. No new cultural resource sites were discovered in the
parcel. Two of the shovel tests were placed along the shoreline near previously recorded site
41CS102, which was plotted about 30 m off the western shore of the parcel. These two shovel
tests revealed disturbed soils and returned no artifacts. Further shovel testing at this location
was halted after ascertaining that the site is below the current water level (226 ft). No evidence
of site 41CS102 was discovered. Figure 6-1 shows a typical view of the surveyed landscape,
while Figure 6-2 looks northwest towards the plotted location of 41CS102. The locations and
results of all shovel tests excavated in the Jackson Creek parcel are presented in Appendices
A and B.

6.2	Elliott’s Bluff
The Elliott’s Bluff parcel totaled seven acres and was inventoried using four shovel tests. No
new cultural resource sites were discovered in the parcel. The eastern side of the earthen dam
directly across from this parcel slumped out during the fall of 2009. According to an informant
who spoke to the survey crew on site on April 13, the soil from this slump was used to raise
and level the cleared portion of Elliott’s Bluff. This fill can be seen in Figure 6-3, along with
new picnic tables and large boulders that were recently installed. One flake was recovered in
Shovel Test (ST) 15-4; because the flake was within this layer of fill, it was disregarded as out
of context. The locations and results of all shovel tests excavated within the Jackson Creek
parcel are presented in Appendices A and B.

6.3	Oak Park
The Oak Park parcel totaled 29 acres and was inventoried using 14 shovel tests. No new
cultural resource sites were discovered in the parcel. This parcel has been obviously bladed
and timbered in the past and supports no trees except for a double line that might denote an
old forest road. The soils in this parcel are much shallower than the NRCS Soil Survey reports
due to obvious blading. Any archeological deposits present in this parcel have been scraped
away. Figure 6-4 shows a view of the landscape looking through the row of trees toward the
dam. The locations and results of all shovel tests excavated within the Jackson Creek parcel are
presented in Appendices A and B.

Lake O’ the Pines, Sam Rayburn Reservoir, and Wright Patman Lake

Chapter 7

Conclusions
This cultural resources survey investigated 15 separate parcels in seven counties in East
Texas. Six parcels were at Lake O’ the Pines in Marion County, six parcels were at Sam
Rayburn Reservoir in Angelina, Nacogdoches, San Augustine, and Sabine counties, and
three parcels were at Wright Patman Lake in Bowie and Cass counties. The sample consisted
of 1,783 acres and the parcels ranged in size from 7 to 476 acres. Field methods included a
pedestrian inventory accompanied by excavation of 1,560 shovel tests, including 1,228 tests
excavated on transects and 332 shovel tests excavated to investigate sites or isolated positive
tests. Tests were approximately 30 cm in diameter and were dug to either the clay horizon or
to 80 cmbs. Shovel testing density for tests excavated on survey transects was 0.69 tests per
acre, more than double the contractual standard set by the USACE and the survey standards
set by the THC.
Of the 1,560 shovel tests dug within the 15 parcels, 137 tests were positive, for an overall
yield of 9 percent (Table 7-1). Of the 137 positive shovel tests, 121 were on sites and 16 were
isolated occurrences that were not clearly associated with any site. The remaining 1,423
shovel tests were negative, including 1,136 negative tests that were dug on transects and 287
negative tests that were dug on sites or around isolated positive shovel tests.
The inventory investigated 30 archeological sites including seven previously recorded
sites and 23 newly discovered sites. Of the seven previously recorded sites, two (41AG105,

41AG161) could not be confirmed as the true location of the site. The location of a third site
(41MR210) was relocated, but surface inspection and shovel testing were negative for cultural
resources. The remaining four sites were successfully relocated and re-recorded.
Thirteen of the sites recorded yielded temporally sensitive artifacts. These consisted of
prehistoric ceramics from four sites, ceramics and projectile points from two sites, a projectile
point from one site, and historic artifacts and features from six sites.

7.1	Site Research Potential and NRHP
Eligibility Recommendations
The eligibility of any given archeological site for nomination to the NRHP is determined by
evaluating the site’s significance, or its potential to contribute meaningfully to future scientific
research. Research potential is assessed by comparing the types of data that are known—or are
suspected—to exist at the site, together with their provenience, context, and integrity, against
a set of research questions that have been previously recognized for similar sites in the region.
For the current project, these research questions are discussed in the planning document for
East Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
Of the seven previously recorded sites, three (41MR210, 41NA14, 41NA67) were found to be
excessively eroded or were negative for cultural material and are recommended as not eligible
for nomination to the NRHP. The remaining four sites (41AG105, 41AG161, 41NA132,
41SB48) could not be clearly assessed and are evaluated as having uncertain eligibility for
nomination to the NRHP.
Of the 23 newly discovered sites, nine sites (41AG205, 41MR269, 41MR270, 41NA332,
41NA335, 41SA302, 41SA307, 41SA308, 41SB375) were found to have minimal potential
for further research. These nine sites had very low subsurface artifact density and/or lacked
depositional integrity, and are recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP. Using
the limited shovel testing inventory tactics, a clear assessment of research potential could not be
reached for some 14 sites (41AG206, 41AG207, 41AG208, 41AG209, 41AG210, 41NA333,
41NA334, 41SA303, 41SA304, 41SA305, 41SA306, 41SB373, 41SB374, 41SB376). For
example, some of these sites are situated on mounds but have disappointingly low overall
artifact density. Others have promising artifact returns but have unknown or suspect integrity.
Further investigation may show that many of these sites indeed have good research potential;
at present they are assessed as having an uncertain eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.

7.2	Site Summaries and Management Recommendations
Each of the 30 sites is discussed briefly below and a tabular summary is presented in Table 7-2.

Conclusions

tested, the NRHP eligibility status of the site is uncertain. No further work is recommended at
this location.
41AG161. On this previously recorded, ceramic-period prehistoric site, six shovel tests were
excavated; no cultural resources were recovered. The landform on which this site is (recorded
as) located was mostly underwater at the time of the survey. However, as the accuracy of the
plotted site location is questionable, the NRHP eligibility status of the site is uncertain. No
further work is recommended at this location.
41AG205. On this newly discovered prehistoric site, eight shovel tests were excavated; one
lithic flake and one piece of shatter were recovered between 20 and 40 cmbs in one of the eight
shovel tests. The site has an extremely low density of cultural material. Therefore, it is unlikely
that further investigations of the site would yield significant data and the site is recommended
as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP; no further research is recommended.
41AG206. On this newly discovered Late Caddo site, 19 shovel tests were excavated. In all,
76 lithics, 16 prehistoric ceramics, and four pieces of ochre were recovered between 0 and 110
cmbs in ten of the shovel tests. No artifacts were observed on the surface. Due to the limited
data collected, the NRHP eligibility status of this site is unknown. This site should be avoided.
If avoidance is deemed impractical, then further investigations may be necessary to determine
the extent of cultural deposits and the site’s eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
41AG207. On this newly discovered historic site, 12 shovel tests were excavated, with 57
historic artifacts recovered from 0 to 40 cmbs in four of the twelve shovel tests. Six features
are present. Along with 41AG208, data from this site could be used to supplement the history
of Angelina County, but due to the limited data collected, the NRHP eligibility status of this
site is unknown. This site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then further
investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and the site’s
eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
41AG208. On this newly discovered historic site related to 41AG207, a concrete structure
with a trough and a hexagonal base was recorded. Six shovel tests were excavated to determine
the use of the structure; one shovel test was positive with metal fragments between 0 and 20
cmbs. Along with 41AG207, data from this site could be used to supplement the history of
Angelina County, but due to the limited data collected, the NRHP eligibility status of this site
is unknown. This site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then further
investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and the site’s
eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
41AG209. On this newly discovered prehistoric site, six shovel tests were excavated, with
four flakes recovered between 40 and 80 cmbs in two of the six shovel tests. Despite the low
returns from shovel testing, the site is located on a low mound and research potential of the
site is considered to be uncertain. As a result, the NRHP eligibility status of 41AG209 should
be considered as unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical,

then further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and
the site’s eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
41AG210. On this newly discovered prehistoric site, ten shovel tests were excavated and two
lithic flakes were recovered from one test. No artifacts were found on the surface. Despite the
very low returns from shovel testing, the site is located on a low mound and for this reason the
research potential of the site is considered uncertain. As a result, the NRHP eligibility status
of 41AG209 should be considered as unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is
deemed impractical, then further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of
cultural deposits and the site’s eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
41MR210. Six shovel tests were excavated in effort to relocate this previously recorded
prehistoric site. No cultural resources were recovered. This site was recorded as a surface
scatter, but no artifacts were observed on the surface. The site has little research potential and
is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP. No further work is recommended.
41MR269. On this newly discovered historic site, nine shovel tests were excavated, with
historic debris found in one test. All artifacts were found in a borrow pit on the western side
of the site. The site is in proximity to Sam Rayburn Reservoir Dam, and is located near the
existing road leading to the old bridge across Big Cypress Bayou. The remains at this site
likely represent debris generated from a work camp related to the construction of the dam. As
a 1950s-era dump site, the artifacts have little research potential and the site is recommended
as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP. No further work is recommended.
41MR270. On this newly discovered prehistoric site, seven shovel tests were excavated, with
five lithic flakes and an untypable Archaic point that resembles a Motley recovered between
0 and 40 cmbs in three of the seven tests. Despite the diagnostic point, the site has a low
density of cultural material and it is unlikely that further investigations of the site would yield
significant data. The site is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP. No
further work is recommended.
41NA14. This previously recorded site has been largely destroyed. Seven shovel tests were
excavated, and 29 flakes and one piece of shatter were recovered between 0 and 60 cmbs. Most
of the site has been eroded by the lake or cleared and flattened into a campsite. Because this site
no longer has much integrity, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP.
No further work is recommended.
41NA67. This site was previously recorded in 1974 as greater than 50 percent destroyed. Seven
shovel tests were excavated, with three lithic flakes recovered from one of the seven shovel
tests. Because this site no longer matches the descriptions in the site forms due to significant
erosion, it no longer retains integrity, and is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the
NRHP. No further work is recommended.
41NA132. This previously known site was recorded with components ranging from “Early
Lithic” to Caddo and historic. Twenty-four new shovel tests were excavated with 102 lithics,

Conclusions

a piece of red ochre, two pieces of glass, and a historic ceramic sherd recovered from 13 of
the 24 tests. The site has a good density of cultural material, but important questions remain
about its research potential, especially its chronology. As a result, the NRHP eligibility status
of 41NA132 should be considered as unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is
deemed impractical, then further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of
cultural deposits and the site’s eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
41NA332. On this newly discovered prehistoric site, seven shovel tests were excavated; three
lithic flakes were recovered between 60 and 80 cmbs in two of the seven shovel tests. Based
on the overall lack of features and diagnostics and the low artifact yield, this site offers little
or no potential to answer significant questions regarding regional or local archeology. As a
result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is
recommended.
41NA333. On this newly discovered prehistoric site, 19 shovel tests were excavated, with 68
lithic flakes recovered between 0 and 80 cmbs in 10 of the 19 shovel tests. No surface artifacts
and no features were observed. Based on the limited data collection on the site, the NRHP
eligibility status of 41NA333 should be considered as unknown and the site should be avoided.
If avoidance is not possible, then further investigations may be necessary to determine the
extent of cultural deposits and the site’s NRHP eligibility.
41NA334. On this newly discovered prehistoric site, six shovel tests were excavated. Nine
lithic flakes were recovered between 0 and 100 cmbs in two of the six shovel tests. No surface
artifacts and no features were observed. Based on the limited data collected on the site, its
NRHP eligibility status is considered unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is
deemed impractical, then further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of
cultural deposits and the site’s NRHP eligibility.
41NA335. On this newly discovered historic site, six shovel tests were excavated; three pieces
of glass and one historic ceramic sherd were recovered between 0 and 40 cmbs from three of
the six shovel tests. A rock feature and surface scatter of trash were also recorded. Archival
research suggests that the landowners may have operated a rural medical clinic, but the
location of such a clinic is uncertain, and neither the artifacts nor the features at this site have
research potential. Based on the low artifact density and the lack of any diagnostic features,
the site is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is
recommended.
41SA302. On this newly discovered prehistoric site, 11 shovel tests were excavated, with three
lithic flakes recovered between 40 and 80 cmbs in three tests. No artifacts were observed on
the surface and no features were present. Based on the overall lack of features and diagnostics
and the low artifact yield, this site offers little or no potential to answer significant questions
regarding regional or local archeology. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for
nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is recommended.

ceramic sherd, one projectile point, one biface fragment, 27 lithic flakes, two pieces of lithic
shatter, and piece of red ochre were recovered between 0 and 80 cmbs in 18 of the shovel tests.
An underground pipeline crosses the site. Based on the limited data collected on the site and
the fact that the site consists of mounds, its NRHP eligibility status is considered unknown
and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is not possible, then further investigations may be
necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and the site’s NRHP eligibility.
41SA304. On this newly discovered prehistoric site, 18 shovel tests were excavated, with
one ceramic and three lithic flakes recovered between 60 and 100 cmbs in four of the 18
shovel tests. Based on the limited data collected on the site and the fact that the site consists
of mounds, its NRHP eligibility status is considered unknown and the site should be avoided.
If avoidance is deemed impractical, then further investigations may be necessary to determine
the extent of cultural deposits and the site’s NRHP eligibility.
41SA305. On this newly discovered prehistoric site, six shovel tests were excavated. One
prehistoric ceramic sherd, 14 lithic flakes, and two pieces of lithic shatter were recovered
between 0 and 80 cmbs in three of the six shovel tests. Based on the limited data collected, the
NRHP eligibility status of 41SA305 is considered unknown and the site should be avoided. If
avoidance is deemed impractical, then further investigations may be necessary to determine
the extent of cultural deposits and the site’s NRHP eligibility.
41SA306. On this newly discovered prehistoric site, eight shovel tests were excavated, with
seven lithic flakes recovered between 20 and 60 cmbs in three shovel tests. Based on the limited
data collected on the site and the fact that the site consists of mounds, the NRHP eligibility
status of 41SA306 is considered unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is
deemed impractical, then further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of
cultural deposits and the site’s NRHP eligibility.
41SA307. On this newly discovered prehistoric site, seven shovel tests were excavated. Three
lithic flakes were found between 0 and 60 in one of the seven shovel tests. No artifacts were
found on the surface and no features are present. The site has an extremely low density of
cultural material and it is considered unlikely that further investigations would yield significant
data. As a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further
work is recommended.
41SA308. On this newly discovered prehistoric site, 12 shovel tests were excavated, with three
lithic flakes recovered between 20 and 40 cmbs in two of the twelve shovel tests. No artifacts
were found on the surface and no features are present. The site has an extremely low density of
cultural material and it is unlikely that further investigations would yield significant data. As
a result, it is recommended as not eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is
recommended.
41SB48. This previously recorded prehistoric site was originally speculated to be a burial
mound. Fourteen shovel tests were newly excavated and 18 prehistoric ceramics, a projectile

Conclusions

point, a biface, a core, 91 lithic flakes, and 13 pieces of lithic shatter were recovered between
0 and 100 cmbs in 12 of the 14 shovel tests. No evidence of burials was observed. Due to the
limited data collected, the NRHP eligibility status of this site is unknown. This site should be
avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then further investigations may be necessary to
determine the extent of cultural deposits and the site’s eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
41SB373. On this newly discovered Middle to Late Caddo occupation site, 23 shovel tests
were excavated; 16 ceramics and 15 flakes were recovered between 0 and 100 cmbs in ten of
the 23 shovel test. Based on the data collected on the site and the fact that the site is a series of
mounds, the NRHP eligibility status of 41SB373 is considered unknown and the site should be
avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then further investigations may be necessary to
determine the extent of cultural deposits and the site’s NRHP eligibility.
41SB374. On this newly discovered historic site, six shovel tests were excavated; 51 historic
artifacts were recovered between 0 and 60 cmbs in four of the six shovel tests. Two cistern
features were present and are partially filled with sediment. Because the contents of the cisterns
are unknown, the research potential of the site is uncertain. As a result, the NRHP eligibility
status is unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then
further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and the
site’s NRHP eligibility.
41SB375. On this newly discovered historic site, six shovel tests were excavated around
three historic features, with five historic artifacts recovered from two of the six tests. Neither
the features nor the artifacts have potential for further research. The site cannot clearly be
linked to the earliest homestead and has no unique attributes that would contribute to a better
understanding of the history of Sabine County. As a result, the site is recommended as not
eligible for nomination to the NRHP, and no further work is recommended.
41SB376. On this newly discovered prehistoric site, eight shovel tests were excavated, with six
lithic flakes recovered between 0 and 100 cmbs in four of the tests. No artifacts were observed
on the surface and no features were present. Despite the limited artifacts observed, the site is
located on a prominent landform and further excavations may yield significant deposits. As a
result, the research potential of the site is uncertain and its NRHP eligibility status should be
considered unknown. The site should be avoided; if avoidance is deemed impractical, then
further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural deposits and the
site’s NRHP eligibility.

Appendix E Prehistoric Ceramic Analysis

Introduction
In all, 50 prehistoric ceramic artifacts were examined and described from seven sites: 41SB48
(n = 18), 41AG206 (n = 15), 41SA303 (n = 1), 41SA304 (n = 1), 41SB373 (n = 14), and 41SA305
(n = 1). The ceramic analysis focused on describing sherd attributes, vessel manufacture, and
decorative techniques. The data collected from the sherds, along with comments about unique
characteristics, are presented in Table E-1. Interpretation was broad, as the sample sizes were
small. All of the collected artifacts were from shovel tests. The ceramic description and analysis
found that the decorations and temper suggest most of the sherds came from Caddo utilitarian
and fine-ware vessels.

Definitions
Sherd attributes included data on vessel part, sherd size, and sherd thickness. Vessel parts were
described as base, rim, and body. Base sherds were identified by a flat and generally thicker
cross section from the underside of the vessel. Rim sherds included the lip of the vessel. No
rims were large enough to make an estimate of vessel size. Body sherds comprise the surface
of the vessel between the rim and base sherds. Sherd size was determined by placing the sherd
in the center of a scale of concentric rings with a 5-millimeter (mm) separation. Size was
determined as the ring closest to the edge of the sherd. Thickness was measured by pinching
the thickest portion of the sherd between parallel edges of calipers and was defined by the
maximum perpendicular distance (in millimeters) between the interior and exterior surfaces
of the sherd.
Vessel manufacture description included examining temper and firing techniques. For this
analysis, temper was bone, grit, or grog, grog/sand, bone/grog, and shell/grog. Temper was
observed using a reflective light microscope set at 25x magnifications. Bone temper was
identified by several white angular inclusions in the vessel paste. Grit temper was identified
by angular inclusions that were not quartz sand crystals, bone, or grog inclusions in the vessel
paste; material was identified where possible. Grog was identified by several fine angular
inclusions of fired clay in the vessel paste. Sand was identified by an abundance of quartz
sand grains within the sherd. Shell was identified by flat, angular, often flaky white fragments.
Firing was described using Teltser’s (1993:530–543) article with a chart of oxidization patterns
in sherd cross sections.
Decoration techniques described included decoration type, location, and surface treatment.
Decoration types included in the sample are plain, brushed, punctate, engraved, and incised
categories for this analysis. None of the sherds contained decorative elements distinctive
enough to relate to a specific vessel type. Without decorative elements, only manufacture data
was obtained. As stated in Suhm and Jelks (1962:19), several varieties of vessels were only
decorated around the rim, leaving a large portion of the vessel undecorated. Decoration location
was exclusively on the exterior of the sherd (convex). Surface treatments were described as
smooth with surfaces having been created while the vessel was wet.

Sample Descriptions
Site 41SB48 ceramic sherd sample included 18 specimens divided into five rim and 13 body
fragments (Figure E-1A–C). Sherd sizes ranged from 10 to 40 mm, with seven of the sherds
25 mm in size or greater. Decorative elements were found on the exterior of eight (plain/
decorated ratio of 2.25) of the sherds: four brushed sherds and four incised sherds with parallel
lines between 7 and 10 mm apart. None of the decorative elements could be attributed to a
specific ceramic type. The remaining ten sherds, four of which were rims, were all plain with
smoothed surfaces. Temper inspection found 10 (56%) exclusively grog sherds, six bone/grog
sherds, one shell/grog sherd, and one sand temper sherd. Thickness ranged from 4 mm to 8 mm
with no obvious correlations to decoration, temper, or firing. Firing in a reduced atmosphere
was predominant on nine (50%) of the sherds, followed by six sherds with mixed oxidization
and reduction, and only three sherds completely oxidized in cross section. In conclusion, the
analysis of 18 ceramic sherds from 41SB48 found evidence of utilitarian Caddo ceramics. The
presence of brushing on four of eight (50%) of the decorated sherds is suggestive of a post–AD

Figure E-1. Decorated ceramics (individual sherds are identified in Table E-1).

1400 date, as the ratio of plain/decorated sherds (1.25) contrasts to those described in Perttula
(2000:28) and Middlebrook and Perttula (1997:7) at 2.97 to 4.8 plain/decorated ratios. The
single sherd with shell temper suggests a very late Caddo occupation (after ca. AD 1600) for
the site. Shell temper is very rarely seen in East Texas Caddo sites, and it is likely that this
sherd is from a trade vessel (Tim Perttula, personal communication, 2010).
Site 41SB373 ceramic sample included 14 specimens divided into four rim and 10 body
fragments (see Figure E-1E–G). Sherd sizes ranged from 20 to 35 mm, with ten of the sherds
25 mm in size or greater. Decorative elements were found on the exterior of five (36%) of the
sherds: two brushed, one incised, and two engraved from near or on the rim of the vessel. None
of the decorative elements could be attributed to a specific ceramic type. The remaining nine
sherds were plain with smoothed surfaces. Temper inspection found nine (64%) exclusively
grog sherds and four bone temper sherds. Thickness ranged from 5 mm to 10 mm with no
obvious correlations to decoration, temper, or firing. Firing in an oxidized atmosphere was
present, with seven sherds (50%) having thin reduced interiors and/or exteriors. In conclusion,

the analysis of 14 ceramic sherds from 41SB373 found evidence of utilitarian and fine Caddo
ceramic wares made in a like process.
Site 41SA303 had only one ceramic sherd. This sherd is a plain rim sherd with grog temper.
Sherd thickness was only 5 mm with a smoothed exterior surface. Firing environment provided
oxidized exterior and interiors of the sherd and a reduced core.
Site 41SA304 had only one ceramic sherd. This sherd is a plain body sherd with grog temper.
Sherd thickness was only 4 mm with a smoothed exterior surface. Firing environment was
completely reduced.
Site 41SA305 had only one ceramic sherd. This sherd is a plain rim sherd with grog temper.
Sherd thickness was 6 mm with a smoothed exterior surface. Firing environment provided
oxidized exterior and reduced interior.
Site 41AG206 ceramic sample included 15 body sherds (see Figure E-1D). Sherd sizes ranged
from 15 to 45 mm, with seven of the sherds 25 mm in size or greater. Decorative elements
were found on the exterior of 10 (plain/decorated ratio of 1.5) of the sherds: nine brushed
(three sherds were refit) and one with two rectangular punctations. None of the decorative
elements could be attributed to a specific ceramic type. The remaining five sherds were
plain with smoothed surfaces. Temper inspection found 13 (72%) exclusively grog-tempered
sherds, one bone sherd, one sand/grog sherd, and one sand temper sherd. Thickness ranges
from 5 mm to 8 mm with no obvious correlations to decoration, temper, or firing. Firing in
an oxidized atmosphere was predominant on six (40%) of the sherds, followed by six sherds
with mixed oxidization and reduction, and only three sherds mostly reduced in cross section.
In conclusion, the analysis of 15 ceramic sherds from 41AG206 found evidence of utilitarian
Caddo ceramics. The high percentage of brushing among all the sherds (60%), grouped with
the low ratio of plain to decorated sherds (0.5), indicate a post–AD 1400 Caddo occupation
(Perttula and Reese 2000:28).

Results
Without diagnostic decorative elements on any of the sherds to aid in distinguishing cultural
and temporal affiliation, sherd temper provides broad insights only. The use of grog temper
in 44 of the 50 sherds examined, followed by bone and bone in combination with grog in 11
sherds, is indicative of Caddo ceramics. Sherd thickness and the use of brushing (n = 15) and
lesser amounts of incising (n = 5) and punctations (n = 1) are also suggestive of Caddo utility
wares on all of the sites. Engraved sherds on 41SB373 suggest fine wares on the site. Sites
41SB48 and 41AG206 are most likely Late Caddo sites (ca. AD 1400–1600) because of the
number of decorated sherds and the presence of brushed sherds in the samples. Excavation of
larger units is necessary to refine the date range and use of both sites.
