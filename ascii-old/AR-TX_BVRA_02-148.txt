ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of 13 high probability areas for prehistoric sites, 4 historic
cemeteries, and 2 water treatment plant sites within the path of a proposed 64.3 mile water
distribution line was conducted by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) in April and
May of 2005 for the Fayette Water Supply Corporation (WSC) under Antiquities Permit
3735. Most of the project area is in Fayette County, but small segments are in Bastrop
and Gonzales counties. In all, 117 acres were examined.
Five previously recorded prehistoric sites (41FY145, 41FY509, 41FY510, 41FY511,
and 41FY454) are shown on the Ammannsville, LaGrange West, and Flatonia NW
topographic maps on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) as
being in or near a portion of the water distribution line. Previously recorded sites 41FY145
and 41FY454 were assessed. The portions of these sites within the project area were
found to lack research potential, and no further work is recommended.
Previously
recorded sites 41FY509, 41FY510, and 41FY511 were not visited, as they have been
previously determined to lack research potential.
One previously unrecorded prehistoric site (41FY544) was found on the high bluff
overlooking the Colorado River to the northwest. Artifacts noted within the right-of-way
consist of one broken Palmillas point and one flake. The landowner showed the Project
Archaeologist a biface from the site, and he reported observing flakes and freshwater
mussel shell in the general area. Site 41FY544 is classified in this report as an unknown
site type, possibly a lithic scatter. That portion of the site within the project area is not
eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark; therefore, no further work is recommended. The projectile point
was collected and returned to the landowner. Palmillas points date to the Archaic period.
Four historic cemeteries are in the area. They are Cistern Catholic Cemetery,
Cistern Public Cemetery, Psencik Cemetery, and the Robbins family cemetery. It is
recommended that they be avoided. If this is not possible, scraping prior to the installation
of the water line should be conducted.
In addition, the water line passes near a sign on a fence marking the possible
location of Lane Pool School. According to the sign, the school was in use from 1890
through 1960. The building has been demolished, and no evidence of this site was found
in the project area. There is disagreement among the local inhabitants as to the exact
location of this school, and some say it was not in the area where the sign indicates it to
be.

INTRODUCTION
The Fayette WSC is applying for funds from the United States Department of
Agriculture, Rural Development to improve its water distribution system by providing
service to new customers in rural Bastrop, Fayette, and Gonzales counties (Figure 1).
In addition to new water line, the project will also include a water well and associated
water plant. Topographic coverage of the project area is provided by nine USGS 7.5â
maps. These are Ammannsville (2996-331), Cistern (2997-442), Flatonia NW (2997413), Jeddo (2997-431), La Grange East (2996-334), La Grange West (2996-333),
Swiss Alp (2996-332), Togo (2997-443), and Waelder (2997-424). The location of the
project area as currently planned is depicted on these USGS maps, which are on file at
the Texas Historical Commission in Austin, Texas. The entire project area is also
depicted in figures 2-3 in this report.
When possible, the Fayette WSC plans to place the 64.3 miles of water line on
private property outside the highway right-of-way and centered in a 15-foot wide
easement. The only area where the line is planned to be within the highway right-ofway is adjacent to the Psencik Cemetery, Cistern Catholic Cemetery, Cistern Public
Cemetery, and the Wood Creek Subdivision. The pipe will vary in size from 3 to 8
inches and will be placed in a trench with 36 inches of cover. The right-of-way will be
prepared by brush clearing when necessary. Subsurface disturbance will be created
by a trenching machine. Grading and/or leveling, when conducted, will be done
using a backhoe or bulldozer. Fences will be removed in those cases where access
to the easement cannot be obtained by other means. The water line will always be
on one side of the road. The water treatment plants will be constructed on a site of
one acre or less.
In a letter from William A. Martin of the THC to Bradley C. Loehr, P.E. of BEFCO
Engineering, Inc. in La Grange, Texas, a cultural resources survey by a qualified
archaeologist was requested. In order to satisfy this requirement, BEFCO and Fayette
WSC retained BVRA to perform this service.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following discussion was taken from the published soil survey for Fayette
County (Ressel and Brown 2004). Fayette County is located in the southeastern part of
central Texas. The county has a total area of 614,100 acres (960 square miles). Of
that total, about 4666 acres is water. The topography in most areas is nearly level to
undulating, but some areas are hilly and steep. Elevation in the county ranges from
200 to 500 feet above sea level.
Fayette County is in the Texas Claypan Area and Texas Blackland Prairie Major
Land Resource areas. Sandy soils are found in the Texas Claypan area, and these
soils were formed under post oak savannah and are mostly light in color. Clayey and
loamy soils are found in the Blackland Prairie. These soils were formed under grass
and are mostly dark. The Colorado River is the major drainage in the county.
Fayette County is hot during the summer months and cool in the winter when an
occasional surge of cold air causes a sharp drop in otherwise mild temperatures.
Rainfall is uniformly distributed throughout the year and peaks in the spring. Annual
total precipitation is normally adequate for cotton, feed grains, and small grains. In
winter, the average temperature is 54 degrees Fahrenheit, and the average daily
minimum temperature is 43 degrees. In summer, the average temperature is 83
degrees, and the average daily maximum temperature is 94 degrees. Total annual
precipitation is about 37 inches. Of this, 22 inches (60%) usually falls in April through
September.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
General
The project area is located in a region referred to in a statistical overview
compiled by Biesaart et al. (1985:Figure 15) as the Central Coastal Plain CulturalGeographic Region. When the overview was published in 1985, there were 1067
recorded archaeological sites in the region. This figure represented 5.28% of the
state. Of the 13 cultural-geographical regions in Texas, the Central Coastal Plain
was 10th in number of sites recorded. In 1985, there were only 65 recorded sites in
Fayette County. This was 6.10% of the region and .32% of the state. Site types
were listed as Paleo-Indian (2), Archaic (19) and Late Prehistoric (6). Some sites
are mentioned as being disturbed due to erosion, construction, and soil deflation.
Four sites are mentioned as being destroyed. No sites had been excavated, 48 had
been tested by hand, and 14 had been surface collected. Hearths and concentrations
of burned rock are also noted.
According to Nightengale and Jackson (1983:6), Fayette County occupies a
transitional zone between east, coastal, and central Texas cultures with the most
influence being from the central part of the state. This statement is based on a
comparison of projectile point types and, in some cases, pottery with those found in
the Central Texas region. This thesis is presented in more detail in a report by
Duford W. Skelton (1977:13-16).
Previous Investigations in Fayette County
The amount of work conducted in Fayette County (the primary portion of the
project area) has increased considerably in the 20 years since the statistical overview
was published. The number of recorded sites, for example, has increased from 65 to
over 500. The earliest work in the area was conducted by A. M. Wilson who
surveyed portions of Bastrop, Fayette, and Travis counties in June of 1930. An
unpublished report is on file at TARL (Wilson 1930). The first systematic study was
performed by J. P. Nunley (1963) in the 1960s, when he surveyed the area to be
inundated by the proposed Columbus Bend Reservoir. Of the 65 prehistoric sites
recorded in the county in 1985, 1 is Paleoindian, 19 are Archaic, and 6 are Late
Prehistoric. Two individual sites were investigated in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
These are the Frisch Auf! site (41FY128) which produced the first association of
Scallorn arrow points as grave goods in Central Texas burials (Hester and Collins
1969) and the Meier site (41FY59) which contained a Paleo-Indian component (Meier
and Hester 1972). The Frisch Auf! site, in contrast to other sites in the county, lies
within the Colorado River floodplain. Typically, sites in Fayette County were found
during these studies to be on the higher sand and gravel terraces above the
floodplain. Although these higher landforms protect sites from flooding, they are
subject to sheet erosion and slope wash, making them appear as surface sites due to
a very thin layer of soil, often less than six inches deep.

6

In the 1970s, archaeological activity in Fayette County increased as work was
done in conjunction with highway projects and transmission corridors. In the 1980s,
the most extensive survey was conducted over a 13,000 acre tract destined to
become a lignite mine (Nightengale and Jackson 1983). This study identified 56
prehistoric and 34 historic sites. Overall, the prehistoric sites were found to be
adjacent to creeks as only five sites were found on upland interfluves. In the
Cummins Creek Prospect area, 80% of the project area is overlain by Quaternary
fluviatile terrace deposits of gravels containing large quantities of chert and quartzite.
Two percent is overlain by the Manning Formation, which contains quantities of
knappable petrified wood. This tract is located on the divide between the Brazos and
Colorado rivers and, as such, would have been easily accessible to groups from both
basins as well as from the northwest and southeast (Nightengale and Jackson
1983:7). The Texas Highway Department continued work in the county in the 1980s
and into the 1990s when significance testing was conducted at two prehistoric sites
(41FY170 and 41FY509) (Price 1991).
Several studies involving historic sites have also been performed in the
county. These include:
â¢

Historic sites research at Biegel Settlement, a German community established
in 1838, by the Texas Archeological Survey as part of the Fayette Power
Project (Carter and Ragsdale 1976)

â¢

A study of historic sites located along Baylor Creek recorded during a span of
20 years as a result of projects conducted for the Lower Colorado River
Authority (Utley and Eling 1994). The sites were field checked and archival
research was carried out. The majority of sites are 19th century farmsteads,
although two cemeteries were part of the study. Most of the houses have
been razed, and the remains are not considered significant.

â¢

Archaeological excavations at the Kreische Brewery (41FY128)

In addition to archaeological reports, historical accounts are documented in local
county histories. Those identified during this survey include Bastrop County, 16911900 (Moore 1977); History of Bastrop County, Texas Before Statehood (Kesselus
1986); The History of Bastrop County Between 1846 to 1865 (Kesselus 1987);
Fayette County, Her History and Her People (Lotto 1902); Chronicles of Fayette
(Sinks 1975); Early History of Fayette County, 1822-1865 (Weyand); An Early History
of Fayette County (Weyand and Wade 1936); Fayette County: Past and Present
(Williams 1976), and The History of Gonzales County, Texas (Gonzales County
Historical Commission 1986).
It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss each Fayette County project in
detail. For the interested reader, a list of references regarding work in the county is
presented at the end of this report as Appendix I â Suggested Readings.

Previous Investigations Relevant to the Project Area
The site records at TARL indicated the presence of five previously recorded
prehistoric sites in or near the path of the water line as currently proposed. These
are 41FY145, 41FY509, 41FY510, 41FY511, and 41FY454.
Site 41FY145 was recorded by Jane Laurens and Jan Guy of Prewitt and
Associates while conducting a survey for the Fayette Electric Cooperative in 1979
(Laurens, et al. 1979). This site is described on the site form as a thin scatter of
burned rock and lithic debris associated with natural gravel and petrified wood
deposit, which appeared to be eroding out of a road cut through a gently sloping hill.
There is a discrepancy in the sketch map (not to scale) on the site form and the
TARL plotting. On the site form, the archaeologists observed cultural material along
Old Waelder Road (referred to as an access road on their map). The TARL plotting,
however, shows a large circle on top of the hill to the north of their survey area with
no reference to the area depicted on the sketch map. On the site form the
archaeologists state that they were not able to determine the north-south extent of
this site. Therefore, the TARL plotting may have been drawn by someone else
thinking that the site probably lies on the hill to the north.
Site 41FY509 was recorded by Barbara J. Hickman and Alan Wormser of the
State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (SDHPT) (now TxDOT) in
1989 during a survey for the Plum Bypass on State Highway 71. The site is
described on the site form as a lithic procurement workshop containing a scatter of
lithic debris, tested cobbles, and burned rock on the surface. No reference to a
published report was made. It is probable that documentation of this survey exists in
an unnumbered letter report on file at TxDOT. This site was tested for significance
under the supervision of G. R. Dennis Price of SDHPT in April of 1991. A report
authored by Price (1991) describes the results of testing at this site. Site 41FY409
was determined to be not significant. No further work was recommended, and the
bypass was constructed through the site.
Site 41FY510 was recorded by Alan Wormser of SDHPT in 1990 during a
survey for the Plum Bypass on State Highway 71. The site is described on the site
form as an open campsite located on an upland area containing Uvalde gravels.
Flakes, tested cobbles, and burned rock were observed scattered across the surface,
but no features were noted. A 20th century house and barn with corral was present
on the northeast portion of the site. The area was disturbed through moderate to
severe sheet erosion. No further work was recommended, and the bypass was
constructed through the site.

8

Site 41FY511 was recorded by Alan Wormser of SDHPT in 1990 during a
survey for the Plum Bypass on State Highway 71. The site is described on the site
form as a possible open campsite with no features observed. It is situated on a
deflated surface on a rocky upland area. Disturbance noted consisted of severe
erosion. No further work was recommended, and the bypass was constructed
through the site.
Site 41FY454 was recorded by William E. Moore in 1985 on personal time.
Moore walked over the site area and observed flakes on the surface in eroded areas
and adjacent to animal burrows. No shovel testing was conducted; therefore, the site
area was estimated at 200 m x 500 m based on the landform. Disturbance was
observed in the form of plowing, erosion, and animal burrows. No statement
regarding significance was made due to insufficient data.

METHODS
Background Check
Prior to entering the field, the site records at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin were checked
for the presence of previously recorded archaeological sites in the project area and
vicinity. In addition, a thorough review of the existing literature for Fayette County was
conducted. The location of the project area as currently planned is depicted on these
USGS maps, which are on file at the Texas Historical Commission in Austin, Texas.
Field Assessment
The Principal Investigator drove the entire 64.3-mile water line with the Project
Engineer in order to better identify high probability areas. During this assessment, both
sides of the road were investigated to include public rights-of-way and private
easements. The sites of the proposed water treatment plants were determined in the
field to be low probability areas for archaeological sites as they are on rather flat
landforms with no water nearby. Other areas were eliminated from consideration due to
disturbance such as erosion and human intervention (i.e., agriculture, structures, or
ponds), shallow soils (i.e., clay or sandstone at the surface), and distance to water.
Collection and Curation Policy
A Research Design was submitted to the Texas Historical Commission for
approval prior to the survey (Appendix II). The collection policy stated that all diagnostic
artifacts observed, and all artifacts found in shovel tests will be collected for analysis in
the laboratory. All artifacts determined to be significant will be placed in permanent
curation at TARL, and those artifacts determined to be not significant will be discarded.
Artifacts found on private property will be returned to the landowner.
Field Survey
A 100% Pedestrian Survey of 13 high probability areas as described in the
Research Design for the Antiquities Permit was conducted in April 2005. Fayette WSC
intends to place the water line on private property when possible, but will use existing
and disturbed rights-of-way when necessary to avoid prehistoric or historic sites.
Therefore, the survey was limited to the 15-foot easement on private property. All
survey areas were checked for eroded and otherwise exposed areas that might reveal
displaced cultural materials. The subsurface was examined through shovel tests in 11
areas and backhoe trenches in 2 areas. Each shovel test was recorded on a shovel
test log (Appendix III) and discussed in the project notes. Locations of shovel tests are
depicted on drafted maps in the Discussion of Areas Surveyed section below. The
excavated matrix was screened using Â¼ inch hardware cloth. In all, 80 shovel tests
were excavated. The Project Archaeologist documented the project with a digital
camera, hand-held GPS, and field notes.

10

Since shovel testing in areas 14 and 15 encountered sand to a depth of 100 cm,
backhoe trenches were excavated in order to reach four feet, the vertical extent of the
proposed construction. At the time of the survey, it had not been decided which side of
the road would receive the water line. Therefore, shovel tests were excavated on both
sides. Later, it was decided to place the water line on the west side of the road in these
areas to avoid existing utilities. Therefore, the three backhoe trenches were placed on
this side only. The trenches were 10 meters long x .75 meter wide, and varied in depth
from 130 cm to 150 cm. Profiles were drawn in the field, and photographs were taken
of each trench (Appendix IV).
Prehistoric Sites
Previously recorded site 41FY145 was examined through Pedestrian Survey
and shovel testing. The exposed road cut in the vicinity of the area where cultural
materials were depicted on the site form was checked as well as rodent burrows and
other forms of disturbance. A sample of lithic debris was collected from the surface for
analysis in the laboratory. That portion of the recorded site within the project area was
photographed with a digital camera. Appendix V depicts the location of this site on the
topographic map as shown on the maps at TARL.
This site was visited during this study by the Project Archaeologist using a site
form and GPS. A Pedestrian Survey was conducted of the project area (north of the
site as depicted on the sketch map), and six shovel tests were excavated (all negative).
Samples of surface debris were collected and returned to the laboratory where they
were determined to be non-cultural except for one piece of fire-cracked rock. The
results of the analysis appear in Appendix VI. The site area as depicted on the site form
sketch map is adjacent to a road. BVRA believes some of the materials described by
the Prewitt archaeologists as cultural may have been brought to the area during road
construction. There are no obvious artifacts mentioned on the site form. Instead, they
describe the cultural materials as âburned quartzite and chert (a few pieces), a few chert
flakes, several pieces of modified petrified wood (tabular pieces with edges rounded by
chipping), and unmodified petrified wood. It is very difficult to identify pieces of petrified
wood as cultural in most cases, and Fayette County is not an area where this raw
material was commonly used, as there was an abundance of high quality chert
available in prehistoric times. A site revisit form was submitted to TARL.
In summary, little evidence of site 41FY145 was found in the project area. That
portion of this site within the project area is not eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark.

11

Previously recorded prehistoric site 41FY454 within the path of the water line
was missed during the TARL search, but the project reviewer noted this error. This
location was, however, determined to be a high probability area and was shovel tested.
In all, eight shovel tests were excavated on both sides of the highway within the path of
the proposed water line, and no cultural materials were found. A site revisit form was
completed and submitted to TARL.
Three previously recorded prehistoric sites (41FY509 â 41FY511) within the path
of the water line near the community of Plum were also missed during the TARL
search, but the project reviewer noted this error (Appendix V). Site 41FY509 was
tested for significance by TxDOT and determined not to possess research potential.
Sites 41FY510 and 41FY511 contained few artifacts, were found to be severely
disturbed, and not selected for significance testing by TxDOT. These sites were visited
during the assessment, and disturbance within the right-of-way was confirmed. Outside
the right-of-way, areas of disturbance relating to agricultural activities were noted.
Based on these factors (prior determination of lack of significance and disturbed nature
of the sites), shovel testing was not conducted. A site revisit form for these sites was
not considered necessary.
Newly recorded prehistoric site 41FY544 was examined through a Pedestrian
Survey, photographed, and located with a hand-held GPS. Due to a lack of soil, shovel
tests were not excavated. The location of this site is depicted on the USGS map, La
Grange East (Appendix V). A site form for 41FY544 was submitted to TARL.
Historic Sites
Four historic cemeteries and the possible location of a school dating to the 19th
and 20th centuries were documented. The cemeteries were observed near the
easement as currently planned. The route of the water line in the area of each
cemetery was photographed. They were examined in an effort to determine the
general age of cemeteries as represented by the headstones present. The area around
Robbins Cemetery (not fenced) was walked in an effort to identify the distance of
marked graves to the right-of-way. The headstones had fallen over. This obscured the
dates, and no attempt was made to check them for dates. Since these sites are outside
the project area, no site numbers were assigned.
A sign placed on a fence post in Area 1 mentioned the presence of Lane Pool
School on the south side of Lane Pool Road. This was a Negro school that was in use
from 1890 to 1960. The field efforts made to locate the site consisted of a surface
inspection of the project area easement and three shovel tests (9-11). Resources at the
Fayette County Public Library were checked, and local residents were interviewed.

DISCUSSION OF AREAS SURVEYED
Area 1
This high probability area is depicted on the Ammannsville 7.5â topographic
quadrangle and consists of the high ground on the northeast and southwest banks of
the crossing of Lane Pool Creek by Lane Pool Road. The water line will placed on
private property and may be on either side of the road; therefore, both sides were
investigated. At the time of this study, the area northeast of the creek on both sides of
the road was in pasture with scattered oaks and elms. On the southwest side of the
creek the area northwest of the road was heavily forested, while the area on the
southeast side of the road was open pasture. Both banks were visually inspected.
Eight shovel tests (1-8) were excavated on the northeast bank of the creek. These
tests were excavated on both sides of the road and varied from 10 cm to 30 cm and
were dug through clay. Two tests were dug through a thin mantle of sand overlying the
clay. Six shovel tests (9-14) were excavated on the southwest bank of the creek.
These tests were excavated on both sides of the road and were dug to 10 cm through
clay. All tests were negative. The placement of shovel tests in this area is depicted in
Figure 4. Within this area, a sign depicting the location of Lane Pool School was
observed on the fence (Figure 5). This historic site is discussed in the Results and
Conclusions section below.

Area 2
This high probability area is depicted on the Ammannsville 7.5â topographic
quadrangle on the southwest side of F.M. 155 at the crossing of Lane Pool Creek
between Guenther Road and the community of Cozy Corner. The water line will be
placed on private property on the west side of the creek. At the time of this study, the
area was in pasture. Scattered cobbles were observed on the rise nearest the creek.
They did not appear to have been utilized or tested. Four shovel tests (1-4) were
excavated on the high ground south of the creek and were dug through clay to 10 cm.
Four shovel tests (5-8) were dug on two small rises north of the creek. These tests
were dug to 10 cm through clay. All tests were negative. Figure 6 depicts the
placement of the shovel tests in this area.

Area 3
Psencik Cemetery is depicted on the Cistern 7.5â topographic quadrangle on the
east side of Rosanky Road. The water line will be placed within the disturbed county
road right-of-way on the east side of the road. The cemetery was found to be well
maintained and still in use. A low chain link fence bounded the property. Gravestones
dating from 1888 to the present were observed. This site is outside of the project area
as currently proposed for the water distribution line (Figure 7). The right-of-way
adjacent to the cemetery is shown in Figure 8.

Area 4
This high probability area is depicted on the Cistern 7.5â topographic quadrangle
and consists of a small rise on the south side of F.M. 2237 on the east bank of Live Oak
Creek. The water line will be placed on private property on the south side of the
highway. At the time of this study, the area was in pasture. Five shovel tests (1-5)
were excavated and varied in depth from 10 cm to 60 cm. The soil varied from sandy
loam over clay-to-clay loam over clay. Shovel Test 5 contained only clay. All tests
were negative. Figure 9 depicts the placement of the shovel tests in this area.

This high probability area is depicted on the Cistern 7.5â topographic quadrangle
and consists of the high ground on the northeast bank of a tributary of Live Oak Creek.
The water line will be placed on private property and may be placed on either side of
the road; therefore, both sides were examined. At the time of this study, the area had
been mowed and was covered with a short grass. Four shovel tests (1-4) were dug on
the south side of F.M. 2237, and four shovel tests (5-8) were dug on the north side of
the road. All of the tests on the south side of the road were dug through clay and
gravels to 10 cm. On the north side, two tests were dug through clay to 10 cm, and two
were dug through a mantle of sand to clay and terminated at 50 cm. All tests were
negative. Figure 10 depicts the placement of the shovel tests in this area.

This high probability area is on the Cistern 7.5â topographic quadrangle and
consists of the high ground on the south side of Allen Road on the east and west banks
of Dogwood Creek. The water line will be placed on private property on the south side
of the road. At the time of this study, the area east of the creek was in a recently
cleared pasture, and the area west of the creek was a low rise in short pasture. Four
shovel tests (1-4) were dug through a clay loam over clay to 10 cm. The remaining four
tests (5-8) were dug on the west bank of the creek through sand and sand over clay.
The depth of these tests varied from 50 to 90 cm. All tests were negative. Figure 11
depicts the placement of the shovel tests in this area.

consists of a high hill on the south side of Allen Road to the east of Dogwood Creek.
The water line will be placed on private property and may be placed on either side of
the road; therefore, both sides were examined. The area surveyed was in pasture with
fair surface visibility. The 100% Pedestrian Survey found only clay at the surface. No
shovel tests were excavated, and no cultural materials were observed. The area is
depicted in Figure 12.

The Cistern Public Cemetery is depicted on the Cistern 7.5â topographic
quadrangle as being on the west side of Manchester Street in the community limits of
Cistern. The cemetery is well maintained and enclosed by a chain link fence.
Gravestones dating from 1885 to the present were observed. A producing oil well lies
within the cemetery fence. This historic site was observed to be outside of the right-ofway as currently proposed for the water distribution line. Figure 13 shows the proposed
water line. The water line will be placed within the disturbed street right-of-way on the
west side of Manchester Street adjacent to an existing water line. This area is shown in
the photograph in Figure 14.

Robbins Cemetery is depicted on the Cistern 7.5â topographic quadrangle as
being on the south side of Robbins Cemetery Road in rural Bastrop County. This is a
small family cemetery that is not fenced. A 100% Pedestrian Survey was conducted
along the proposed water line route to identify marked graves. Also, an inspection was
made in the thick brush and woods south of the proposed route to locate the cemetery.
Three gravestones, all lying on the ground, were found. The nearest observed grave is
approximately 40 meters from the proposed water line route. Figure 17 depicts the
proximity of the cemetery to the project area. The water line will be placed in the private
easement on the south side of the road as shown in Figure 18.

This high probability area is depicted on the Flatonia NW 7.5â topographic
quadrangle and consists of the high ground on the north side of Old Waelder Road east
of the crossing of Big Fivemile Creek. The water line will be placed on private property
on the north side of the road. At the time of this study, the area was in a pasture with
scattered oaks, elms, and mesquite. Five shovel tests (1-5) were dug on the north side
of the road through hard packed clay to 10 cm. All tests were negative. Standing water
was observed in low areas along the route. Figure 19 depicts the placement of the
shovel tests in this area.

Area 12
Previously recorded site 41FY145 is depicted on the Flatonia NW 7.5â
topographic quadrangle and close to the path of the water line as currently proposed.
The water line will be placed on private property on the north side of the road. At the
time of this study, the area was in woods consisting of oaks, elms, and juniper. Six
shovel tests (1-6) were dug on private property on the north side of Old Waelder Road
through clay and clay loam over clay. The depths of these tests varied from 10 to 40
cm. All tests were negative. Figure 20 depicts the placement of the shovel tests in this
area. Clearing for the fence line and bioturbation presented a good view of the ground
surface along much of the proposed route. A surface inspection was made of the road
cut south of the project area. It is this area where artifacts were collected during the
original visit to the site by archaeologists from Prewitt and Associates. The location of
this site on the maps at TARL is different from the map on the site form. This
discrepancy is discussed in the Results and Conclusions section which appears later in
this report.

This high probability area is depicted on the Jeddo 7.5â topographic quadrangle
and consists of the high ground on the north side of Jeddo Road on the east bank of
Peach Creek. The water line will be placed on private property on the north side of the
road. At the time of this study, the area was in pasture. Five shovel tests (1-5) were
dug through clay loam over clay to depths of 30 to 100 cm. All tests were negative.

Area 14
This high probability area is depicted on the Jeddo 7.5â topographic
quadrangle and consists of the high ground on both sides of Doe Run Road in the
Wood Creek Subdivision on the east bank of Copperas Creek. At the time of this
survey, the location of the water line was not known; therefore, both sides of the road
were shovel tested. Due to a conflict with existing utilities, the water line will be
placed in the disturbed right-of-way on the west side of the road. At the time of this
study, the area shovel tested consisted of disturbed right-of-way. The side of the
elevated landform had been mechanically cut away during road construction to the
level of the road. Then, ditches had been cut along both sides of the road. Road
base, consisting of gravels and some chert cobbles, had been brought in during
construction. Eight shovel tests (1-8) were dug through sand to a maximum depth of
100 cm, and not all tests reached clay. Two backhoe trenches (1-2) were excavated
on the west side of the road where deep sand had been encountered during shovel
testing. They were placed on the west side of the road because of existing utilities on
the east side. Backhoe Trench 1 was placed at the location of Shovel Test 4, and
Backhoe Trench 2 was placed between shovel tests 2 and 3. No cultural materials
were found in the shovel tests or backhoe trenches. Figure 22 depicts the location of
the shovel tests and backhoe trenches.

Area 15
This high probability area is depicted on the Jeddo 7.5â topographic
quadrangle and consists of the high ground on both sides of Doe Run Road in the
Wood Creek Subdivision on the southeast bank of Copperas Creek. At the time of
this survey, the location of the water line was not known; therefore, both sides of the
road were shovel tested. Due to a conflict with existing utilities, the water line will be
placed in the disturbed right-of-way on the west side of the road. At the time of this
study, the area shovel tested consisted of disturbed right-of-way. Cutting and filling
activities during road construction had altered the original ground surface. Road
base, consisting of gravels and some chert cobbles, had been brought in during
construction. Eight shovel tests (1-8) were dug through sand to a maximum depth of
100 cm, and not all tests reached clay. One backhoe trench (3) was excavated on
the west side of the road where deep sand had been encountered during shovel
testing. It was placed on the west side of the road because of existing utilities on the
east side. It was excavated at Shovel Test 4. No cultural materials were found in the
shovel tests or backhoe trench. Figure 23 depicts the location of the shovel tests and
backhoe trench.

Area 16
This high probability area is depicted on the La Grange East 7.5â topographic
quadrangle and consists of a summit on a high bluff overlooking the Colorado River
to the northwest, a steep slope toward the river, and a toe slope (Figure 24). The
water line will be placed on private property and will parallel an existing water line. At
the time of this study, the area on top of the bluff was wooded with the exception of
areas cleared by the landowner for his yard. The slope was covered with thick
grasses and vines. The toe slope by Camp Lone Star Road was in grass, but an
exposed ditch revealed a good view of the subsurface clay. A 100% Pedestrian
Survey revealed little or no soil overlying sandstone on top of the bluff. Therefore, no
shovel tests were excavated. One projectile point and one flake were observed on
the surface on top of the bluff. The point was collected for analysis. The entire area
is privately owned.

This high probability area is depicted on the Togo 7.5â topographic quadrangle
and consists of the high ground on the west side of Anchor Ranch Road on the north
bank of Buckners Creek. The water line will be placed on private property on the west
side of the road. At the time of this study, the area was in pasture with some woods.
Five shovel tests (1-5) were dug in the area. Three tests were dug through clay to a
depth of 10 cm, and two tests were dug through sand and terminated at 30 cm. All
tests were negative. Figure 25 depicts the placement of the shovel tests in this area.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Previously Recorded Prehistoric Sites
Site 41FY145 was visited during this study (see Appendix V for plotting on
topographic map). A Pedestrian Survey was conducted of the project area (north of the
site as depicted on the sketch map), and six shovel tests were excavated, all negative.
Samples of surface debris were collected and returned to the laboratory where they
were determined to be non-cultural except for one piece of fire-cracked rock. The
results of the analysis appear in Appendix VI. The site area as depicted on the site form
sketch map is adjacent to a road. BVRA believes some of the materials described by
the Prewitt archaeologists as cultural may have been brought to the area during road
construction. There are no obvious artifacts mentioned on the site form. Instead, they
describe the cultural materials as âburned quartzite and chert (a few pieces), a few chert
flakes, several pieces of modified petrified wood (tabular pieces with edges rounded by
chipping), and unmodified petrified wood. It is very difficult to identify pieces of petrified
wood as cultural in most cases, and Fayette County is not an area where this raw
material was commonly used, as there was an abundance of high quality chert
available in prehistoric times.
In summary, little evidence of site 41FY145 was found in the project area. That
portion of this site within the project area is not eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark.
Site 41FY454 was visited during this study (see Appendix V for plotting on
topographic map). Eight shovel tests were excavated in the area, and no cultural
materials were found. Since the plotting on the site map is only an estimate of the site
boundary, it is believed that this site does not extend into the proposed water line rightof-way.
Sites 41FY509, 41FY510, and 41FY511 were not visited during this survey. As
stated above, these sites had already been determined by to be not significant. The
areas tested at 41FY509 are depicted on the âTexas Archeological Sites Atlas Map.â
This map clearly shows that both sides of the highway were examined. Since the Plum
Bypass was allowed to be constructed within the known boundaries of these sites, there
was no reason to conduct a Pedestrian Survey or shovel testing in this area. The
location of these sites on the topographic map appears as Appendix V.

Newly Recorded Prehistoric Sites
Site 41FY544 was recorded on top of the high bluff overlooking the Colorado
River and La Grange to the north at an elevation of 370 feet (Figure 26). The soil is
rocky and contains little depth. Artifacts observed include the base of a Palmillas
projectile point and one flake. William A. Dickens analyzed the projectile point in
Appendix VII. The landowner reports additional flakes and pieces of freshwater mussel
shell from the general area. There is not enough information to classify this site;
therefore, it is referred to in this report as a prehistoric site of unknown type. It was also
not possible to determine the size based on the presence of two observed artifacts.
The age of this site is not known, although the presence of a Palmillas point
suggests an Archaic occupation. The overall condition and size of this site could not
be assessed based on the limited area observed during this survey. Part of the site
within the proposed easement has been disturbed by an existing water line and
development by the landowner. This area is not eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark.
Historic Sites
Four historic cemeteries, however, are located in close proximity to the water
line. These are the Cistern Catholic Cemetery (1902 to present), Cistern Public
Cemetery (1885 to present), Pscenik Cemetery (1888 to present), and Robbins
Cemetery (1851 to 1893). Three cemeteries will be avoided by placing the water line
in the public rights-of-way. At Robbins Cemetery, the water line may be placed within
a private easement. This appears to be a small family cemetery with the nearest
marked grave about 40 meters from the county road. According to a survey of
cemeteries in Bastrop County by Audrey Rother et al. (1987), this cemetery contains
graves dating between 1851 and 1893. Since the cemeteries are outside the project
area right-of-way, site numbers were not assigned.
The water line passes near the site of Lane Pool School. According to a sign on
the fence it was in use from 1890 through 1960 (Figure 5). The building has been
demolished, and this historic site will not be affected by construction. There is
disagreement among the local inhabitants as to the exact location of this school, and
some say it was not in the area where the sign indicates it to be. Since this site is
outside the project area right-of-way and its actual location is not known, it was not
assigned a site number.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed construction will not affect any prehistoric sites eligible for listing
on the National Register of Historic Properties or designation as a State Archeological
Landmark. The proposed route of the water line will, however, pass near four historic
cemeteries. Based on a discussion with the project reviewer at the Texas Historical
Commission, it is recommended that the water line be placed on the opposite side of
the road from these sites. If this is not possible, it is recommended that the entire area
of excavation in close proximity to each cemetery be scraped to a depth sufficient to
look for unmarked graves. This task must be performed under the supervision of a
professional archaeologist. A separate report documenting this activity will be prepared
as a supplement to the current report.
It is recommended that the Fayette WSC be allowed to proceed with their water
supply line construction in the remaining areas as planned. Should any archaeological
sites not mentioned in this report be discovered during construction all work must cease
until the situation can be resolved by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology
Division. If the route of the water line is changed from the areas mentioned in this
report, the Texas Historical Commission must be notified. Should the route of the water
line change to the opposite side of the road in a previously field assessed low
probability area, future field survey or notification to the Texas Historical Commission
will not be required. This project was conducted following the Minimum Survey
Standards defined by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division.

RESEARCH DESIGN
FAYETTE WSC PHASE 7 IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
(FAYETTE, GONZALES, AND BASTROP COUNTIES)

Records Check
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) will contact the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the state repository for site records, to
determine if previously recorded sites are present in the project area. In addition, a
review of relevant archaeological reports will be conducted, and local informants will
be interviewed concerning known sites and artifact types in the area.
Project Description
The Fayette WSC wants to install water line within rural portions of Fayette,
Gonzales, and Bastrop counties. These improvements will include new water well
and water plant. The water line will be placed on private property when possible
and moved to public rights-of-way in necessary to avoid significant archaeological
sites. In one case, the line will traverse cross-country for a distance of 2250 feet.
The water lines will have a minimum cover of 36â and will be installed using a
trencher. In some cases, however, a backhoe or trackhoe may be needed. The
diameter of the water line will be 8â or less. The width of the trench will be 12-24â
wide, and the easement will be 15â. The water plant will be placed within a one-acre
tract.
Site Types
Based on previous work in the area, habitation sites located on sandy knolls
adjacent to streams are the most common site type. These sites usually date to the
Late Prehistoric period and typically contain ceramics, lithics, faunal materials,
hearths, and sometimes burials. Often, they are in a sandy mantle with little site
integrity. Less common, are buried sites in the flood plains of major creeks and
rivers. Exposed gravels suitable for the manufacture of stone tools are very
common in Fayette County, especially north of the Colorado River. Therefore,
there is a good possibility of encountering lithic quarry sites. One such site
(41FY145) was identified near the project area during a survey for the Fayette
Electric Cooperative in 1979.

Survey Methods
The Principal Investigator for this project is William E. Moore, and the Project
Archaeologist is Edward P. Baxter. No fieldwork will commence until an Antiquities
Permit has been issued for this project. The high probability areas selected for
survey were identified after three tasks.
â¢

The Principal Investigator reviewed the topographic maps.

â¢

The Principal Investigator discussed the project with an archaeologist who is
familiar with sites in the area.

â¢

The Principal Investigator and Bradley C. Loehr, the Project Engineer drove
the entire project area and checked the maps against actual field conditions.

The survey crew will dig shovel probes to test for soil depth above the
Pleistocene clay. Shovel probes differ from shovel tests in that the excavated soil is
not screened, and the location of the probes are not typically depicted on the
project area map. These tests will adequately cover the area and will be dug in
arbitrary 10 cm levels. All excavated earth will be passed through Â¼ inch hardware
cloth. Shovel tests will be dug to the underlying clay subsoil when possible and to
depths of about 100 cm in sandy areas when clay is not reached. Artifacts found in
shovel tests will be collected and analyzed in the laboratory prior to curation.
When a site is found, an attempt to determine its boundaries through shovel testing
and surface inspection will be made, and all diagnostic artifacts observed on the
surface will be collected.
All sites found in the project area will be mapped. The site map will depict
the shovel tests (positive and negative). GPS plottings will be taking to more
accurately plot it on the proper USGS topographic map. All archaeological sites will
be assigned a field number. Later, an official trinomial will be assigned by TARL.
Future references to these sites will use the TARL number. The number of shovel
tests will meet or exceed that number requested in the Minimum Survey Standards
for projects of 200 acres or less.
The field assessment found no floodplain areas suitable for backhoe
trenching.
The field assessment observed no historic sites within the proposed
easements. Four cemeteries are near the project area. The route of the water line
will be evaluated in terms of any possible impact on these historic sites.
The entire project will be documented through digital photography, a handheld GPS, forms, and field notes.

FAYETTE WSC RESEARCH DESIGN - (PAGE THREE)
Artifact Analysis
All significant artifacts will be collected for analysis in the laboratory. They
will be described and measured. Those specimens deemed worthy of permanent
curation will be processed and turned over to TARL. All artifacts not viewed as
containing research potential for future researchers will be discarded following a
written document authorizing this action from the Texas Historical Commission,
Archeology Division or returned to the landowner if found on private property.
Report Preparation
A report documenting this project will be prepared following the guidelines
established by the CTA and THC. The style of this report will generally follow
that adopted by American Antiquity. Two copies of the draft report will be
submitted to the THC for review. A discussion of the project and
recommendations for future work will be included. Following acceptance of this
report, 20 copies will be submitted to the THC for distribution to regional libraries.
No site specific information will be present in the 19 copies for the general public.

APPENDIX VI
SURFACE-COLLECTED LITHICS FROM 41FY145
A small number (n=8) of lithics were collected from the surface of
previously recorded site 41FY145. These include 3 fragments of silicified wood,
4 small chert pebbles, and 1 small chunk of fire-cracked rock.
The silicified wood fragments range between 1 and Â¼ inch to slightly over
2 inches in length. These are highly silicified fragments composed of a hard and
solid composition as compared to the more common forms that fracture easily
into thin irregular fragments. Although this âqualityâ may be suitable for tool
manufacture, not one of these pieces exhibit cultural modifications.
The chert samples include both rounded pebbles and irregular chunks.
They range in size from 5/8 inch to 1 and 1/8 inch in length. All are fractured by
some natural factors such as fire, frost, or from crushing by the movement of
heavy equipment. Not one exhibits any attributes of cultural modifications.
The single piece of fire-cracked rock is the only specimen that may have
been culturally produced. It is marble sized and heavily rounded on all of its
edges and contains the typical coloration of blackened to reddish portions
common to burned limestone. Such materials were commonly utilized in rock
ovens in Central Texas for at least 6000 to 7000 years (Black and Ellis 1997:9).
These ovens were constructed of large pieces of limestone and heated to
high temperatures. After the desired temperatures were reached, they were
either covered by a thin layer of soil before roots, tubers, or meats were placed
on the surface. These were, in turn, covered with more soil or the addition of
more heated limestone and left to bake. Once the process was complete, the
hole was uncovered and the foods removed. The heated limestone; however,
usually fragmented into small pieces and was discarded. The sample specimen
appears to be such a fragment.

APPENDIX VII
DESCRIPTION OF PROJECTILE POINT
A single projectile point was found on the surface of site 41FY544 on a
rocky bluff overlooking the Colorado River to the northwest. This point is
classified in this report as belonging to the Palmillas type as defined by Turner
and Hester (1997:167). It is a small, leaf-shaped point with slight to well-barbed
shoulders. Its stem is expanding, and the base is bulbar-like and expanding.
This type is found from East Texas to the Coastal Plain and as far west as the
Lower Pecos. According Davis (1995:146-147), Palmillas points date from the
Middle through Late Archaic periods of Texas prehistory (circa 1500 B.C. to 500
B.C.).
Only the proximal half of the point is present. The distal tip was broken
from impact through use. Additional damage has resulted from exposure to heat,
probably from surface grass fires, which were common during prehistoric times.
It is made of a light gray chert with small white inclusions. This material probably
was obtained from gravels associated with the Colorado River. The point is 25.9
mm long and 21.9 mm wide. The juncture of the stem was measured directly
below the shoulders and is 12.2 mm wide.
