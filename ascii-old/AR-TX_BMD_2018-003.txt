Abstract

ABSTRACT
The Town of Flower Mound contracted Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. to perform a
cultural resources background review and archeological deep testing for the Denton Creek Boulevard
Bridge Project (Project) in Denton County, Texas. The survey was performed under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 8561. The following report provides information regarding the Project and includes the
methods and results of the cultural resources background review and archeological deep testing of an 0.9acre Area of Potential Effects (APE). No cultural resources were identified within the APE during the
background review or deep testing. The Project does not appear to have potential to impact cultural
resources listed or eligible for listing as State Antiquities Landmarks or in the National Register of
Historic Places. As a result, no further consideration of cultural resources under the Antiquities Code of
Texas or Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act is recommended in association with the
proposed Project.

Introduction

INTRODUCTION

The Town of Flower Mound contracted Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. (Burns &
McDonnell) to perform a background review and archeological deep testing for the proposed Denton
Creek Boulevard Bridge Project (Project) in Denton County, Texas (Appendix A: Figure A-1). The
following report provides information regarding the Project and includes the methods and results of the
cultural resources background review and deep testing.

1.1

Project Description

In support of ongoing expansion of Denton Creek Boulevard, the Town of Flower Mound is proposing to
build a bridge across Graham Branch, a low order tributary to Denton Creek. The proposed bridge would
measure approximately 100-feet-wide (30.5 meters [m]) and 400-feet-long (122 m), with depths of impact
down to 40 feet (12 m) for subsurface supports. Because the Project would be funded by the Town of
Flower Mound, a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the Antiquities Code of Texas applies for this
Project. The Project will also require a U. S. Army Corps of Engineers permit for impacts to Waters of the
U.S., so compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act is also required. All
cultural resource investigations were conducted in accordance with the Secretary of Interior’s Standards
and Guidelines for Identification and Evaluation and the Archeological Survey Standards for Texas
established by the Council of Texas Archeologists.

1.2

Area of Potential Effects

The proposed Area of Potential Effects (APE) is defined as the total 0.9-acre bridge footprint to a
maximum of 40 feet (12 m) below the ground surface (Appendix A: Figure A-1).

1.3

Project History and Personnel

Burns & McDonnell cultural resources specialists conducted a background review prior to the
commencement of fieldwork. The deep testing was conducted on October 4, 2018. The fieldwork was
performed by Daniel Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriguez also served as the Project’s Principal Investigator. The
survey was performed under Antiquities Permit Number 8561.

Research Design

RESEARCH DESIGN

The overall objective of the background review and archeological deep testing was to locate and assess
archeological sites and historic-age (50 years of age or older) properties listed, or eligible for listing, as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) within the
APE that could potentially be affected by Project construction. The following chapter provides
information regarding the sources consulted during the background review as well as the methods used
during the archeological deep testing.

2.1

Background Review Methods

A Burns & McDonnell archeologist performed an examination of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to
identify previously recorded cultural resources within a Study Area extending 1 mile from the APE. This
review included identification of archeological sites, NRHP-listed sites and districts, SALs, historic-age
cemeteries, Official State of Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs) such as Recorded Texas Historic
Landmarks, as well as previous cultural resources surveys reported within the Study Area.
Additionally, the Soil Web supplied by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Potential
Archeological Liability Maps (PALM) provided by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT),
and historic period maps provided by the U.S. Geological Survey Historic Topographic Map Explorer and
the Texas Historic Overlay (Foster et al. 2016) were consulted. These sources were studied to assess the
potential of previously unrecorded cultural resources occurring in the Project area.

2.2

Deep Testing Methods

Throughout the APE, mechanical trenching was conducted in lieu of shovel testing (Appendix A: Figure
A-2). Four trenches were mechanically excavated, one in each quadrant of the Project area. Burns &
McDonnell subcontracted a mechanical excavator and operator to perform the trenching. The excavator
was fitted with a 3-foot-wide (0.9 m) toothless bucket. Mechanized excavations proceeded in a slow,
controlled manner. At a depth of 4 feet (1.2 m) below surface, walls in each trench were closely examined
for the presence of archeological deposits, a vertical section was scraped clean, and a stratigraphic profile
was recorded. After examination, each trench was slowly excavated down to the level at which preHolocene, culturally sterile substrate was exposed, or down to the maximum reach of the excavator arm.
Stratigraphic profiles were completed for each trench. During excavation, a sample of trench backdirt was
screened through ¼-inch mesh unless the matrix was dominated by clay, in which case the matrices were
troweled through and visually inspected for artifacts and other evidence of archeological deposits. All
trenches were photographed upon completion and then backfilled. Occupational Safety and Health

Results of the Background Review

RESULTS OF THE BACKGROUND REVIEW

The background review documented that no previous archeological surveys have been reported within 1
mile of the Project. The closest previous survey is located approximately 1.5 miles east of U.S. Highway
377 (Appendix A: Figure A-1). That survey was conducted in 2012 in support of the widening of U.S.
Highway 377 between Roanoke and Denton. No previously recorded archeological sites, NRHP-listed
sites or districts, SALs, historic-age cemeteries, or OTHMs have been reported within the 1-mile Study
Area or within the APE. Additionally, there are no recorded archeological sites along the Graham Branch
of Denton Creek outside of the 1-mile Study Area. No areas with high historic-age site potential were
identified within the APE based on the review of historic-age maps.
Soils within the APE are mapped as Frio silty clay. Frio silty clay is a very deep, well-drained soil formed
in calcareous loamy and clayey alluvium on nearly level to very gently sloping floodplains (NRCS 2018).
The PALM indicates these soils have high potential to contain both shallow and deeply buried
archeological deposits (Abbott 2011) (Appendix A: Figure A-3).

Results of Deep Testing

RESULTS OF DEEP TESTING

Deep testing was conducted within the APE in areas identified on the PALM as having high potential for
buried archeological deposits due to the presence of Holocene-aged alluvium. Four backhoe trenches
(BHT) were excavated; one in each quadrant of the 0.9-acre APE (Appendix A: Figure A-2). The trenches
were confined to areas where soils had not been previously disturbed. A transmission line corridor crosses
the eastern edge of the APE and a barbed wire fence bisects the center of the APE, running west to east
(Appendix B: Photographs B-1 and B-2). A dirt two-track road runs north to south along the western edge
of the Project (Appendix B: Photograph B-3).
Each trench measured approximately 5 m (16 feet) in length and 1 m (3 feet) in width. The trenches were
excavated to depths ranging from 103 centimeters below surface (cmbs) (3.4 feet) to 234 cmbs (7.7 feet).
Trench excavations were terminated upon encountering bedrock (in BHT 1) or the water table (in BHT 2,
3, and 4). A possible paleo-channel was identified in BHT 1 (Appendix B: Photograph B-5). Gravel and
sand lenses and buried A horizons indicative of flood deposits were observed in BHT 2, 3, and 4
(Appendix B: Photograph B-7 through B-11). These gravel and sand lenses mark numerous periods of
high energy scouring and aggregation of Denton Creek. BHT 3 contained a small amount of mussel shell.
However, no artifacts or cultural features were identified in any of the trenches. Therefore, the observed
mussel shell does not appear to be cultural but rather naturally deposited by these flood events.
Photographs of trench profiles are provided in Appendix B (Photographs B-4 through B-11), and a table
of stratigraphy is provided in Appendix C.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Burns & McDonnell cultural resources specialists conducted a background review of a Study Area
extending 1 mile from the 0.9-acre APE. No previously recorded cultural resources or areas with high
historic-era site potential were identified during the background review. The review of soils and the
PALM indicated that the APE had a high potential for buried prehistoric archeological deposits due to the
presence of Holocene-aged alluvium. Principal Investigator Dan Rodriguez directed and monitored
excavation of four backhoe trenches within the APE on October 4, 2018. No artifacts or cultural features
were identified in any of the trenches. The Project does not appear to have the potential to impact cultural
resources listed or eligible for listing as SALs or in the NRHP. No further consideration of impacts to
historic resources under the Antiquities Code of Texas or Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act is recommended in association with the proposed Project. If previously unidentified
cultural resources are encountered during construction or if significant changes to the project APE are
made, then additional assessments of impacts to cultural resources would be required.
