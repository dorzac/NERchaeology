ABSTRACT

This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey
conducted on 90.65 hectares (224 acres) of property proposed for the construction of a
residential development in Montgomery County, Texas. During this investigation, 7
previously unrecorded cultural resources were located within the project area. These
resources consisted of low-density lithic scatters (Sites 41MQ212 and 41MQ213) and
isolated lithic flakes (Isolate Finds #1 through #5). All of these resources were recorded
along the ridges and hill slopes overlooking either White Oak Creek or its unnamed tributary.
No cultural features were observed in association with these sites. The archaeological
contexts of all non-diagnostic artifacts were noted, but this material was not collected during
survey.
Soils observed in the project area resemble descriptions published in soil manuals for
this portion of Montgomery County. The presence of water-worn gravels and alluvial
sediments indicate that lateral stream channel alteration and down cutting, most likely from
periodic flooding, bank slumping, and resulting soil transport and redeposition, have been
important natural processes impacting this landscape. Also, mechanical logging is evident by
remnant logging roads throughout the property. The presence of artifacts within these
disturbed colluvial and alluvial deposits, the low density of observed cultural material, and a
lack of cultural features indicate that these sites have been dramatically impacted by postdepositional alterations. Previous testing also concluded a lack of integrity associated with
the cultural resources within the vicinity.
For these reasons, HRA Gray & Pape recommends that these sites are not eligible
for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. HRA Gray & Pape also
recommends that no further investigation be required in the project area, and that the project
be allowed to proceed as planned.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC of Houston, Texas (HRA Gray & Pape) performed an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey on 90.65 hectares (224 acres) of property
proposed for the construction of a residential development in Montgomery County, Texas.
The goals of the survey were to determine if the project would affect any previously
identified archaeological sites as defined by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to establish whether or not previously
unidentified buried archaeological resources were located within the project’s Area of
Potential Effect (APE).

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The residential development, which includes the construction of private residences
and associated infrastructure, will occur on approximately 90.65 hectares (224 acres) of
property located along Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 3083 north of White Oak Creek. The
project location is also adjacent to a previous survey undertaken by HRA Gray & Pape (see
Pickering and Hughey 2006), and shares all the physical characteristics of that property.

ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT
This report is organized into 7 numbered chapters. Chapter I provides an overview of
the project. Chapter II presents the environmental setting and geomorphology of the project
area. Chapter III presents a discussion of the cultural context associated with the region.
Chapter IV discusses the results of previous cultural resources surveys near the project area.
Chapter V presents the research design and field methods developed for this survey. The
results of research and survey activities are presented in Chapter VI. Chapter VII presents
the investigation summary and conclusions.

CHAPTER II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

The following section provides a discussion of the general geomorphological
characteristics found in the Montgomery County area. This is followed by discussions of soil
characteristics, climate, and the flora and fauna typical of the area.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
The Texas Coastal Plain makes up part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain, a low, level
to gently sloping region extending from Florida to Mexico. The Texas Coastal Plain extends
north to the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and west to the Balcones escarpment in central
Texas. The basic geomorphological characteristics of the Texas coast and associated inland
areas, which includes Montgomery County, resulted from depositional conditions influenced
by the combined action of sea level changes brought about by glacial advance in the northern
portions of the continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load
capacity of the region’s rivers. Locally, Montgomery County is underlain by relatively
recent sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Miocene to
Holocene (Abbott 2001; Van Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott 2001;
Barnes 1992; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term human occupation in
modern-day Montgomery County include the Beaumont Formation, generally believed to
predate human occupation in the region, and the so-called “Deweyville” terraces, which are
positioned stratigraphically between the Beaumont and Recent deposits. These terraces date
to between one hundred thousand to four thousand years ago, and are characterized as
consisting “of up to three inset fluvial terraces…(distinguished by the presence of)…large
looping meander scars…” indicative of watercourses capable of fluvial action and discharge
markedly greater than that seen today (Abbot 2001: 16). Overlaying these deposits may be
relatively thick or thin Holocene deposits, laid down in the Montgomery County area by
alluvial or eolian factors, or potentially, marshy environments.

SOILS
The current project area contains the same soils as in Pickering and Hughey (2006),
namely Bib soils (Bb), Blanton fine sand (BlC), Boy fine sand (Bo), and Conroe loamy fine
sand (CoC) (McClintock et al. 1972).
Bibb soils (Bb) consist of nearly level, poorly drained loamy soils located in
floodplains that drain sandy and loamy soils. The surface layer is composed of grayish
4

brown very fine sandy loam with brown mottles to a depth of 25.4 centimeters (10 inches).
This is followed by a stratum of grayish brown very fine sandy loam with reddish brown
mottles 25.4 centimeters (10 inches) thick. Underlying this is a 109.2-centimeter (43-inch)
thick layer of gray very fine sandy loam with pockets of very pale brown and white silt loam
(McClintock et al. 1972).
Blanton fine sand (BlC) is highly permeable, has a low water capacity, and is found
on convex ridge slopes. The surface stratum consists of 12.7 centimeters (5 inches) of dark
grayish brown fine sand. This is followed by 33.02 centimeters (13 inches) of pale brown
fine sand with faint yellowish brown mottles. Underlying this is a layer of pale brown fine
sand with distinct brown and yellowish brown mottles that is 20.32 centimeters (8 inches) in
thickness. This is underlain by a 55.88-centimeter (22-inch) thick stratum of pale brown fine
sand. The next layer is consists of 45.72 centimeters (18 inches) of pale brown fine sand
with 0.63-centimeter (0.25-inch) thick lamellae of yellowish red loamy fine sand. The final
stratum in the sequence is composed of pale brown fine sand with 1.27-centimeter (0.5-inch)
thick lamellae of yellowish red loamy fine sand and is approximately 60.96 centimeters (24
inches) in thickness (McClintock et al. 1972).
Boy fine sands (Bo) are found on uplands that are level to gently sloping and
moderately well drained. The surface layer typically consists of grayish brown fine sand to a
depth of 17.78 centimeters (7 inches). This is underlain by a stratum of pale brown loamy
fine sand approximately 101.6 centimeters (40 inches) in thickness. Following this is a layer
of brownish gray sandy clay loam mottled with red and strong brown to a depth of
approximately 177.8 centimeters (70 inches) (McClintock et al. 1972).
Conroe loamy fine sand (CoC) is a level to gently sloping soil found on broad ridges
with convex slopes. The upper stratum consists of 7.6 centimeters (3 inches) of soft and very
friable grayish brown loamy fine sand. This is underlain by a layer 53.3 centimeters (21
inches) thick composed of light yellowish brown loamy fine sand that is very friable and
approximately 10 percent, fine and medium, indurated ironstone concretions. Following this
is a 7.6-centimeter (3-inch) thick layer of yellowish brown sandy clay loam which is
characterized as hard, friable, with some red mottles surrounded by weakly cemented
ironstone concretions, and contains few fine and medium indurated ironstone concretions.
This is underlain by a 30.5-centimeter (12-inch) thick layer of yellowish brown clay with
many prominent red mottles that is approximately 35 percent plinthite with few fine and
medium indurated ironstone concretions. Following this is a 38.1-centimeter (15-inch) thick
stratum composed of red, brownish yellow, and light gray clay that is approximately 40
percent plinthite and contains weakly cemented ironstone concretions. This is underlain by a
53.3-centimeter (21-inch) thick stratum of reticulately mottled weak red, light gray, and
strong brown clay with many weakly cemented ironstone concretions (McClintock et al.
1972).

CLIMATE
Montgomery County’s close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico tends to influence the
temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity of the region. Winds usually trend from the
southeast or east, except for in winter months when high-pressure systems can bring in polar
air from the north. Average temperatures in the summer can reach well into the 90s (degrees
Fahrenheit) and are often accompanied by equally high humidity. Although winter
temperatures can reach into the low 30s (degrees Fahrenheit), below freezing temperatures
usually occur on only a few days out of every year, and are typically restricted to the early
morning hours.
Rainfall occurs most frequently during two precipitation peaks throughout the year;
one which typically occurs in late spring, due to the passage of cold fronts, and the other in
late summer and early fall, resulting from tropical storms and hurricanes (Abbott 2001).
Precipitation in Montgomery County averages 120 centimeters (47.44 inches) annually
(Long 1999).

FLORA AND FAUNA
Present-day Montgomery County is located near the western edge of the
Austroriparian biotic province, and is situated in the Blackland Prairies and Post Oak
Savanna ecoregions (Abbott 2001). Evidence from pollen analysis in Central Texas suggests
that, at least during the Late Pleistocene, the area may have been populated by vegetative
species that were tolerant of a cold weather environment. Climactic fluxuation during the
Holocene would eventually result in a gradual trend towards warmer weather, similar to that
seen today (Abbott 2001).
Late Pleistocene flora may have included populations of spruce, poplar, maple, and
pine (Holloway 1997), in an oak woodland environment that would eventually transition to
an oak savanna in the late Holocene (Abbott 2001). Fauna during this time would include
currently present species such as white-tailed deer and various smaller game, as well as
bison, and, in localized areas, pronghorn sheep and the American alligator (Abbott 2001).
The modern vegetative community associated with this region consists of a diverse
collection of trees and undergrowth (Abbott 2001). Various pine species, such as loblolly
and shortleaf, are predominant, but identified trees also include various oaks and elms.
Honeysuckle, dewberry, yaupon, and blackberry are common, as are indiangrass and
bluegrasses (Abbott 2001; McClintock et al. 1972).
The modern faunal community includes mammals such as deer, squirrel, opossum,
raccoon, skunk and various small rodents, numerous bird species, and reptiles including the
Texas rat snake, the western cottonmouth, the kingsnake, and various turtle species. Black
bear and bison were present occasionally in the past (Abbott 2001).

CHAPTER III. CULTURAL SETTING OF THE STUDY AREA

Southeast Texas has traditionally been viewed as a buffer zone between cultural
regions. Patterson (1995) describes the archaeological record in this area as being an
interface between the Southern Plains and the Southeast Woodlands. Along similar lines,
both Shafer (1975) and Aten (1984) have categorized the Post-Archaic archaeological record
of this region as Woodland. This categorization is not meant to literally invoke the exact
cultural patterns and chronology of the Woodlands culture found to the east. But as Aten
(1984:74) states, “it loosely connotes activities by populations on a geographic as well as a
cultural periphery of the southeastern Woodlands.” Under this framework the prehistoric
archaeology of Southeast Texas represents a mixture of diffused technology and local
innovation.
Dee Ann Story (1990) has suggested that the culture of Southeast Texas is distinctive
enough to merit a separate designation by the Late Prehistoric. The Mossy Grove cultural
tradition is a heuristic concept based on technological similarities shared by groups in this
region. The primary marker of this technological tradition is the plain, sandy-paste Goose
Creek pottery that is found in this region from the Early Ceramic through Early Historic
periods.
Ethnic affiliations for the region are not entirely clear. Aten (1983) has defined the
Brazos Delta-West Bay, Galveston Bay, and Sabine Lake archaeological areas and suggests
that they may correlate with the Historic territories of the Coco, Akokisa, and Atakapa
groups respectively. Similarly, historic reconstructions of the inland subregion suggest a
number of possible group affiliations (Story 1990). The historic economic inland/coastal
cycle of the Akokisa, which stretched from Galveston Bay to the San Jacinto River basin,
may mean that archaeological materials in the Lake Conroe area are affiliated with this
group. Alternately, these remains may be associated with the Bidais who occupied territory
immediately to the north of the Akokisa groups. At this point in time, it is not possible to
identify the cultural affiliation of the groups that inhabited the inland subregion. In part, this
is a function of the dynamic nature of this region in which a number of cultural traditions met
and diffused.
The Southeast Texas region is divided into inland and coastal margin subregions,
which have archaeologically distinctive subsistence patterns, settlement patterns, and artifact
types. Archaeological and historic evidence suggests that some groups exploited inland
resources year round, while other groups spent parts of the year both inland and on the coast.

PREHISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL TIME PERIODS
Based on aspects of material culture, researchers have identified six archaeological
time periods associated with Native Americans in southeast Texas; in general, these include
the Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late
Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on the
general framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of
these periods. Patterson’s (1995) chronology, for example, includes Early Paleoindian
(10,000-8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.),
Middle Archaic (3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D.
100-A.D. 600), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the
Historic Indian (A.D. 1700-1800) periods. In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a Southeast Texas
chronology that includes Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8000-5000 B.C.),
Middle Archaic (5000-1000 B.C.), Late Archaic (1000 B.C.-A.D. 400), Early Ceramic (A.D.
400-A.D. 800), and Late Ceramic (A.D. 800-A.D. 1750). Despite these differences, the
chronologies developed by researchers are based primarily on changes in projectile point
technologies within the region and the introduction of pottery. It is generally recognized that
a broad-based hunting and gathering lifestyle was utilized throughout all time periods.

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Evidence is sparse for Paleoindian habitation, and much of what is known about the
period in the area comes from a compilation of materials gathered from the state of Texas
and North America. At the close of the Pleistocene, large game hunters crossed the Bering
Strait, and within a few millennia had penetrated into South America (Culberson 1993;
Newcomb 1961). The Paleoindian people traveled in small bands (Culberson 1993) and
were mega-fauna hunter-gathers with the bulk of their meat protein derived from mammoths,
mastodons, giant bison, and giant sloths. These groups carried with them an easily
recognizable stone tool material culture, though admittedly, little is known about their
wooden or bone tools and clothing types. Diagnostic points such as fluted Clovis, Folsom,
and Plainview points can be used to identify a site’s Paleo component, and the nature of these
points demonstrate the nature of their hunting style. The above points are large and designed
to be attached to a spear. No evidence of bow and arrow hunting has been found associated
with this period (Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961).

ARCHAIC PERIOD
With the retreat of the glaciers (the Hypsithermal period), the mega-fauna upon which
the Paleoindian peoples depended gradually became extinct. This shift in food supply is seen
as the pivotal transition point between the Paleo and Archaic periods (Biesaart et al. 1985;
Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961). Though dates often disagree (ranging from 8000 B.C.
marking the beginning of the Early Archaic [Culberson 1993], to Aten [1984] stating that the

8

transition from Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric-Woodland began around A.D. 100), there are
three progressive stages recognizable during the Archaic period: the Early, Middle, and Late.
Much of what is know about the Early Archaic peoples indicates that they were small,
isolated bands of hunter-gatherers that remained in relatively restricted regions (Aten 1984).
With the loss of the mega-fauna as a food source, the Early Archaic peoples adopted the
hunting of smaller game such as bison and deer and increased their reliance on foraging
(Culberson 1993). The material record fits the transitional makeup of this period because
there was a dramatic shift from the large spear points of the Paleoindian period to a reliance
on smaller dart type points. Diagnostic designs for this period are Dalton, San Patrice,
Angostura, Golondrina, Merserve, Scottsbluff, Wells, Hoxie, Gower, Uvalde, Martindale,
Bell, Andice, Baird, and Taylor (Turner and Hester 1993). These points are much more
crudely made than their Paleo precursors, but remain designed for use on a spear shaft.
The Middle Archaic period saw the largest growth in technology and in the number of
stone tools utilized. Specialized tools appeared for the milling of wild plant foodstuffs
(Culberson 1993) along with a large assortment of tools for food preparation and
procurement. Gravers, scrapers, axes and choppers, knives, drills and polished stone tools,
also known as ground stone tools began to appear in large quantities (Newcomb 1961).
Diagnostic points such as Gary, Kent, Palmillas, Nolan, Travis, Belvedere, Pedernales,
Marshall, Williams, and Lange predominate the spectrum of dart points from the Middle
Archaic period (Turner and Hester 1993; see also the Edwards Plateau Aspect [Newcomb
1961]). The advent of the atlatl also seems to be placed within this period (Culberson 1993).
The Late Archaic period saw a dramatic increase in the population densities of Native
American groups. Human habitation of areas rich in diverse flora and fauna intensified, as
did the variety of materials and artifacts (Culberson 1993; Aten 1984). Late Archaic peoples
began relying heavily on foraging tubers, berries, and nuts and hunting small game such as
deer, rabbits, and raccoons, as well as fish and shellfish, and birds. Groups became socially
more complex than earlier periods and the result was an increasing intercommunication with
neighboring groups. Culberson (1993:55) states that a “Lapidary Industry” developed in
which stone artifacts were made from exotic materials (jasper, hematite, quartz, shale, slate,
etc.) acquired from sources great distances away. These materials were fashioned into an
increasingly complex array of household goods such as celts, plummets, banner stones,
mortars and pestles, and pendants; also during this period there is an increase in the
occurrence of sandstone bowls (Culberson 1993). Diagnostic points of this period are
difficult to distinguish from those of the Middle Archaic. Gary and Kent points remain
prevalent in southeast Texas, while other points such as Marcos, Montell, San Gabriel,
Mahomet, Fairland, and Castroville also appear at times (Turner and Hester 1993).

LATE PREHISTORIC AND PROTOHISTORIC PERIODS
The transitional period between Late Archaic and Woodland-Late Prehistoric is a
period marked by an intensification of group dynamics across Texas. The advent of the bow
9

and arrow is believed by most (Aten 1984; Culberson 1993; Newcomb 1961;) to be from this
period, though some may place it later. Most importantly for archaeological investigations,
the first signs of pottery begin to emerge at sites from this period. Although the amount and
variety of pottery intensifies during the Late Prehistoric, it is an excellent way of determining
the terminus post quem of a site. Fishing, bison hunting, and the collection of wild flora
intensifies beyond the level of the Late Archaic period during this stage, but there is no
sufficient data to demonstrate the initial advent of sedentary agricultural. The diagnostic
points of this period are Catahoula, Friley, Alba, and Bonham (Turner and Hester 1993).
The Late Prehistoric (also known as Woodland and Ceramic Periods) continue from
the end of the Archaic period to the historic period ushered in by the Spanish Missions and
Anglo-American settlers. During this period there is a shift to the almost total use of arrow
points such as Perdiz and, later, Scallorn, and almost every group now has pottery. According
to Aten (1984), there are nearly 18 different types of pottery from this period currently
identified for the east Texas Coast alone based on temper, paste, and design. It is during this
period that peoples known today as the Caddo, Atakapans, and Bidai, to name a few, are
identifiable both culturally and materially. This is mostly due to the historical sources of the
seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries that aid in the reconstruction of the past cultures
in the area.
In order to better understand the complexity of the region’s cultures, researchers turn
to historical sources to get an understanding of the peoples who first occupied the southeast
Texas. Hernando De Soto encountered the Native Americans of the region during his
expedition in 1542 (Hudson 1976); it was the first recorded meeting with the Caddo peoples.
The first expeditions by La Salle in 1687 and the subsequent settlement in the eighteenth
century by Europeans continued to document the presence of Native American groups in the
area (Aten 1984). French traders and Spanish missionaries encountered the Hasinai, also
known as the Neches Angelina, who became allies of the Spanish against the western Apache
tribes (Newcomb 1961). The later historical sources identify the Hisinai as one of the two
main groups in the area of eastern Texas that fall under the Caddo culture (the primary
culture that dominated the Piney Woods area), the other of which is the Kadohadacho (La
Vere 1998; Gregory 1986).
The loose cultural group, known as the Atakapans, dominated the majority of the land
north of present-day Harris County in what is now Montgomery County. Their language
group extended from the Gulf coast to the Trinity and San Jacinto Rivers and they had much
in common with the coastal group known as the Karankawas (Aten 1984). The Atakapans
were subdivided into regional groups. The Akokisas dwelled primarily on the shores of the
Trinity and San Jacinto Rivers. The Patiris group occupied the land north of the San Jacinto
valley. The Bidias group dominated the Trinity Valley and to their north was the small group
known as the Deadoso. Most of what is known about the Atakapans culture comes from the
early accounts of the French explorer DeBellise. They are described as primarily huntergather groups who relied somewhat on agriculture and fishing (Sjoberg 1951).

10

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Spanish and French used the Native
American groups as pawns in the two nations’ quest to settle the area (Newcomb 1961).
Most destructive for all native groups in the region was the influx of European diseases.
When Anglo-American settlers began moving into the area in mass around the 1850s, disease
and warfare had decimated the groups to near extinction.

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENT
It is believed that the first European to enter the region known today as Montgomery
County was the French explorer Rene Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, around the year
1687 (Long 1999). This expedition in turn forced the Spanish overlords of the region to
mount retaliatory expeditions to the region to reclaim the land. Though the Spanish did
manage to establish three missions along Spring Creek, which is within the boundaries of
present-day Montgomery County, they never successfully established permanent settlements
throughout the region. The missions were abandoned around 1756, and only sporadic
settlement occurred until the issuance of land grants by the Spanish and Mexican authorities
to Stephen F. Austin. Anglo-American settlers began to pour in and nearly 42 families
obtained legal land titles from the government. One important early settler to the area was
Andrew Montgomery, who established a trading post on the Loma del Toro crossroads. This
trading post soon grew into the town of Montgomery, which in 1837 with the formation of
Montgomery County became the county seat.
Named after the region’s largest existing city, Montgomery County was created by
the Texas Legislature in 1837. It was the third county established by the republic. The
original borders of the county spanned from the Trinity River on the east to the Brazos River
on the West, the Old San Antonio Road to the north and the San Jacinto River to the south.
Today, Montgomery County is bounded by Walker and San Jacinto Counties to the north,
Harris County to the south, Waller and Grimes Counties to its west, and Liberty County to
the east.
Situated at the juncture of what is today known as the East Texas Timberlands/Piney
Woods region and the Texas Coastal Plain, the nineteenth century landscape consisted of
dense forests situated on exceptionally fertile soil. This attracted many settlers who
immediately began to clear the land in order to exploit it for agricultural production and
cattle grazing. Ranching and basic subsistence farming were the region’s primary
agricultural enterprise until they were superceded in the 1850s by cotton production. The
cotton industry, driven by slave labor and the plantation economy system, experienced a
great boom during prior to the Civil War, partially by exploiting overland trade opportunities
with the growing metropolises of Houston and Galveston.
It was not until the post-war era that the region faced its first economic downturn.
Without the wartime demand for agricultural goods and the loss of slave labor, planters who
had overextended themselves to meet the increased demand for cotton found themselves
without a market and in possession of lands with depleted soils. Recovery for the county did
11

not occur until the construction of several railroad lines in the 1870s. The InternationalGreat Northern Railroad built a line across the county, and the Houston and Texas Central
built a line through Navasota and Montgomery Counties. These lines missed the city of
Montgomery, which was at that time the county seat, but they did intersect at the small
community of Conroe; similarly, the Gulf, Santa Fe, and Colorado rail-lines also intersected
there. Shortly thereafter, in 1889, the county seat was moved to Conroe and has remained
there since.
With the construction of the railroads through out the county, the region saw
increased development of the lumber industry. Long (1999) states that roughly forty-five
steam-powered sawmills were in operation throughout the county in 1882. In 1914, the Delta
Land and Timber Company built the South’s largest timber mill near Conroe. The timber
industry remained the largest revenue source for the county until the 1920s when there was a
steep decline in the amount of available timber within the region due to uncontrolled logging.
Long (1999) also states that in the 1870s the county had eighty percent forest coverage, but
over the next four decades most of the county was deforested.
This deforestation opened the land to a further increase in ranching and farming.
Despite a brief resurgence in cotton production, by the 1910s many farmers began growing
fruits and vegetables in order to meet the demands of the nearby coastal metropolises. The
region saw another downturn when the effects of the Great Depression reached the area, and
continued until the post World War II period. Though the regional farmers benefited little,
the county prospered in the 1930s and beyond due to the discovery of oil near Conroe in
1932. The discovery of oil brought unimaginable wealth to the region as well as a four-fold
population increase. With oil fields discovered all around the county, Montgomery County
soon became the richest oil producing regions in the United States. To date, oil remains the
primary source of income for the county, while the majority of agricultural income comes
from livestock.

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal
Plain tend to be composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits reflecting short-term occupation
episodes. In general, these sites consist of temporally non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin
subsurface deposits, or suggest the presence of multiple cultural components within a mixed
stratigraphic archaeological context. Historic sites near the project area typically consist of
farm- or homesteads dating to the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries.
The primary problem facing researchers working on prehistoric sites in this region
stems from a dearth of cleanly stratified deposits. Environmental conditions leading to slow
soil development combined with rapid urbanization in many areas of southeast Texas have
complicated the already difficult task of reconstructing cultural traditions and developing
chronologies associated with the highly mobile lifeways of the prehistoric hunter-gatherer
populations formerly inhabiting this area.
The majority of larger inland sites consist of sandy middens with high lithic material
counts and moderate amounts of pottery located near water sources. These sites are
generally considered base camps and there is a notable absence of satellite activity areas.
Within the base camps distinct activity loci are present (Patterson 1995).
Lithic artifacts recovered at sites near the current project area are primarily
manufactured from chert and petrified wood. Chert deposits are concentrated in the western
portion of the south Texas region, while petrified wood dominates in the eastern portion of
the region. This geographic parity is generally reflected in the types of materials found at
sites. Sites in the western and central portions of south Texas have predominately chert
artifacts with some petrified wood. Conversely, artifacts recovered from sites in the eastern
portion of south Texas are mainly manufactured of petrified wood (Patterson 1995:256).
Extra-local lithic materials found in the region include Edwards Plateau chert and ground
stone from Arkansas sources. The presence of these materials may suggest the presence of
regional trade networks or through the movement of groups or individuals into the region, as
in the case of the Edwards Plateau material.
Inland sites have a high debitage to core ratio indicating that primary reduction most
often was carried out at source locations. The presence of point preforms in various stages of
production and failure at campsites indicate that blanks and preforms were being transported
back to these locations for final reduction (Patterson 1995). The unifacial tools found at sites
are typically flakes utilized from the bifacial thinning process. These tool types include
scrapers, denticulates, notched tools, perforators, and gravers. These formal tools occur only
in small numbers at inland sites.

13

Projectile point types, along with ceramics on the coastal margin, are the most
distinctive artifacts associated with archaeological sites in southeast Texas. The various
types serve as hallmarks of the cultural periods of the region. These types range from the
Clovis and Folsom points found in the Early Paleoindian period, to the stemmed points of the
Archaic, to the dart points of Late Archaic/Early Ceramic, and finally to the arrow points of
the Late Prehistoric ca. A.D. 500 or 600. The projectile point technologies found in the
region were influenced by adjacent regions through time including the southern plains,
southeast woodlands, Louisiana, and north, central, and south Texas.
A brief overview of selected research projects conducted in close proximity to the
study area is presented below. The results of the background investigation regarding
previous research conducted within the current project area are presented in Chapter VI.
Of most importance to the current study is an intensive pedestrian survey undertaken
by HRA Gray & Pape in 2005. The survey covered 40.47 hectares (100 acres) of property
located adjacent to the current project area to the south (see Figure 1). The survey identified
7 previously unidentified archaeological sites. These sites entailed low-density lithic scatters
or ephemeral campsites located along the hill slopes overlooking White Oak Creek or its
unnamed tributary. In the process of testing the sites for potential National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility, deep testing was undertaken at many locations in and
around the sites. Results showed no deeply buried cultural deposits. Because of the lack of
integrity of the sites and the low number of artifacts none of the sites were recommended as
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP (Pickering and Hughey 2006).
In 2003, the Moore performed a survey on 6.88 hectares (17 acres) for the Brazos
Valley Research Associates. The subject property is located just south of the current project
area (see Figure 1). No previously unrecorded archaeological sites were found during the
survey (Moore 2003).
A road expansion of FM 3083 was the subject of a survey conducted by SWCA, Inc.
Environmental Consultants. The survey found that a large portion of the right-of-way
(ROW) had been heavily disturbed due to logging and housing construction. Parts of the
area were backhoe trenched to test for deep deposits. Four flakes were found in the area,
which the survey team designated as isolated finds (Barile 2002).
A proposed extension of FM3083, connecting Interstate Highway (IH) 45 and State
Highway (SH) 105 northwest of Conroe, Montgomery County, Texas, was surveyed and
shovel tested by Jeff Turpin in 1996, to determine if significant cultural resources would be
affected by construction. Based on the advice of the Department of Antiquities Protection,
two segments totaling 1.5km (.94 miles) in length were targeted for survey. Neither
produced any evidence of prehistoric or historic occupation (Turpin 1996).
In 1988, the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (SDHPT)
conducted a survey for the proposed construction of FM 3083. No evidence of historic or
prehistoric archaeological sites was found during the coarse of the survey (SDHPT 1988).
14

In 1986, the SDHPT conducted a survey on United States Highway 75 (US 75). No
evidence of historic or prehistoric archaeological sites was found and no further work was
recommended (SDHPT 1986).
Harry Shafer and Thomas Stearns recorded a subsurface site within the Sam Houston
National Forest in 1975. The goal of this project was to develop an interpretation of the site
prior to the construction of a recreational center. Most of the recovered artifacts consisted of
shallow, dispersed deposits dating to the Early and Middle Archaic periods (Shafer and
Stearns 1975).

CHAPTER V. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

This archaeological resources survey was designed to identify and assess preliminarily
archaeological resources that may be impacted by the proposed project, as well as to assess
damage to archaeological resources impacted by construction activities initiated by this project
prior to archaeological investigation.
LITERATURE REVIEW AND SITE FILE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Site file research was
performed in order to identify all previously recorded archaeological sites within 1.6-kilometers
(1-mile) of the project areas, and all recorded historic structures eligible for NRHP listing
located adjacent to the project APE. Site file research was used to provide a historic context to
the archaeological survey, and additional documentary research was conducted in order to
provide an understanding of the development and history of the APE, the surrounding area, and
southeast Texas in general. This research then was used to prepare an overview history of the
area, and provided an understanding of the contextual framework of Montgomery County’s
prehistory and history. No previously recorded sites are located within this study radius.

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY METHODOLOGY
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were
designed to identify and record the existence of archaeological resources, prehistoric and
historic, within the defined project boundaries.
In areas where surface visibility allowed for an examination of the ground surface
(i.e. surface visibility greater than 30 percent), a surface inspection of an area measuring 4
meters2 (43 feet2) was performed at each planned shovel test location. Shovel tests were also
excavated in areas considered likely by survey personnel to contain intact subsurface deposits
regardless of surface visibility. Shovel tests typically measured 30 centimeters (12 inches) in
diameter and were excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3 feet) into the underlying
substratum, or until culturally sterile subsoil was encountered. Removed soils were screened
through 1/4-inch hardware cloth. Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard
terminology and the Munsell (2000) soil color charts. Additional information concerning soils
encountered was recorded on standardized shovel test forms for each excavation. Based on
previous results in the area (Pickering and Hughey 2006) deep testing was not deemed
necessary during this survey. Those results showed cultural materials were located at shallow

16

depths within the range of shovel testing. Also, natural impacts to the area have resulted in a
lack of intact cultural deposits overall.

17

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Seven previously unrecorded archaeological resources (five isolated finds and two
sites) were identified within the project area. No architectural resources appearing to be over
50 years in age were observed within the project APE. The results of the site file research
are discussed in the following section, followed by a discussion of the results of the
archaeological field investigation.
Upon survey completion, each cultural resource loci was assessed as to whether or
not formal state recordation would be appropriate. In general, isolate non-diagnostic lithic
finds and sites with extremely low-density lithic scatters were plotted on project maps and
identified by field site or isolate number, but not formally recorded as archaeological sites.
Site trinomials were obtained for all diagnostic isolates and for all sites for which some level
of behavioral activity could be assessed.

SITE FILE AND LITERATURE RESEARCH
Site file research was conducted at TARL and supplemented by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the THC. Research objectives were to identify all recorded
archaeological sites within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the project area. This research indicated
that 7 previously recorded archaeological sites are located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of
the current project area. These are summarized in Table 1 below.

All of these sites were recorded as part of the 2005 intensive pedestrian survey of HRA Gray
& Pape. Cultural materials were found between 0 and 100 centimeters (0 and 3 feet) deep
and typically consisted of low numbers of lithic debitage. None of the sites were
recommended for inclusion in the NRHP (Pickering and Hughey 2006).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
The intensive pedestrian survey was designed to assess the potential impact that
construction activities might have on archaeological resources located within the project area.
The 90.65-hectare (224-acres) project area was subdivided into 2 survey areas (Areas A and
B). Area B was further divided into 5 segments. The results of the intensive pedestrian
survey are detailed below.

AREA A-1
Survey Area A-1 was located on the western side of the study area (west side of FM
3083) (Figure 2). It encompassed an area totaling approximately 8.40 hectares (20.75 acres)
in size. A total of 98 shovel tests were excavated along 8 survey transects during the
intensive pedestrian reconnaissance. A typical shovel test (B6) was excavated to a maximum
depth of 1 meter (3.281 feet) and possessed a surface layer of 10YR 5/3 sand with few to
several gravel inclusions followed by a stratum of 10YR 7/4 sand with few to several gravel
inclusions (Figure 3). Six shovel tests were positive for cultural material. These produced 3
isolates and 2 sites (Sites 41MQ212 and 41MQ213), which are summarized below.
Site 41MQ212
Site 41MQ212, a prehistoric lithic scatter, was identified through 1 positive shovel
test containing debitage (Figure 2). The site is located on a wooded upland area
approximately 210 meters (690 feet) from White Oak Creek. Delineation of this site was
accomplished by the placement of shovel tests at 10 meter (32.81 feet) intervals radiating
from the positive shovel test in the transect directions, opposed to cardinal directions. A total
of 5 additional shovel tests, excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet) were
added, one of which was positive for cultural material (Figure 4).

Site 41MQ213
Site 41MQ213, a prehistoric lithic scatter, was identified through 2 positive shovel
tests containing debitage. This site is located on a wooded upland terrace along White Oak
Creek (Figure 2). Delineation of this site was achieved by the placement of shovel tests
radiating from the positive shovel tests, as was done at Site 41MQ212, in transect directions
and at 10 meter (32.81 feet) intervals. A total of 6 additional shovel tests were excavated to a
maximum depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet) in the process of delineating this isolate, none of
which were positive for cultural material (Figure 5). None were positive for cultural
material.

Isolate Find #1, identified as a prehistoric isolate, was initially identified through a
single positive shovel test containing one lithic flake. The isolate is situated within a wooded
upland area approximately 35 meters (114.83 feet) northwest of FM 3083 (Figure 2). This
isolate was delineated by the placement of shovel tests spaced at 10-meter (32.81-foot) and
20-meter (65.62-foot) intervals radiating in cardinal directions from the positive shovel test.
A total of 4 additional shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet)
in the process of delineating this isolate, none of which were positive for cultural material
(Figure 6). State designated trinomials were not sought for this isolate. Recommendations
regarding this isolate are provided in Chapter VIII.
Isolate Find #2, identified as a prehistoric isolate, was initially identified through a
single positive shovel test containing one lithic flake. The isolate is situated within a wooded
upland area approximately 90 meters (295.28 feet) northwest of FM 3083 (Figure 2). This
isolate was delineated by the placement of shovel tests spaced at 20-meter (65.62-foot)
intervals radiating in cardinal directions from the positive shovel test. A total of 4 additional
shovel tests, excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet) were used for the
delineation of this isolate, none of which were positive for cultural material (Figure 6). Note
that no delineation tests were conducted to the north of the isolate since these would have
fallen outside of the current project boundary. State designated trinomials were not sought
for this isolate. Recommendations regarding this isolate are provided in Chapter VIII.
Isolate Find #3, a prehistoric lithic flake, is situated within a wooded upland area
approximately 65 meters (213.25 feet) north of FM 3083 (Figure 2). This isolate was
delineated by the placement of shovel tests spaced at 10-meter (32.81-foot) and 20-meter
(65.62-foot) intervals radiating in cardinal directions from the positive shovel test. A total of
4 additional shovel tests, extending to a depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet) were used for delineation
of this isolate, none of which were positive for cultural material (Figure 6). State designated

AREA B-1
Survey Area B-1 was situated in the northwestern section of the eastern portion of the
study area (Figure 2). It occupied an area measuring approximately 34.33 hectares (84.83
acres) in size. A total of 166 shovel tests were excavated along 13 survey transects, with 4
additional delineation shovel tests, giving a total of 170 shovel tests for the segment. A
typical shovel test (D:14), was excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet), and
comprised of a surface layer of 10YR 5/3 silty sand followed by a stratum of 5YR 6/3 fine
silty sand with inclusions of coarse sandy clay (Figure 3). Two shovel tests were positive for
cultural materials and are summarized below.
Isolate Find #4, a prehistoric lithic flake, is situated within a wooded upland area
approximately 400 meters (1312.34 feet) east of FM 3083 (Figure 2). This isolate was
delineated by the placement of shovel tests spaced at 15-meter (49.21-foot) intervals
radiating in cardinal directions from the positive shovel test. A total of 4 additional shovel
tests, extending to a depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet) were used for delineation of this isolate,
none of which were positive for cultural material (Figure 6). State designated trinomials
were not sought for this isolate. Recommendations regarding this site are provided in
Chapter VIII.
Isolate Find #5, a prehistoric lithic flake, is situated within a wooded upland area
approximately 100 meters (328.08 feet) northwest of an unnamed tributary of White Oak
Creek (Figure 2). This isolate was delineated by shovel tests spaced at 30-meter (98.43-foot)
intervals radiating in cardinal directions from the positive shovel test, none of which were
positive for cultural material (Figure 6). State designated trinomials were not sought for this
isolate. Recommendations regarding this site are provided in Chapter VIII.

AREA B-2
Survey Area B-2 was located in the southeastern section of the eastern portion of the
study area (Figure 2). It encompassed an area measuring approximately 12.08 hectares
(29.86 acres) in size. A total of 24 shovel tests were excavated along 7 transects during the
initial intensive pedestrian survey of the area. None were positive for cultural material. A
typical shovel test (F:3), was excavated to a maximum depth of 50 centimeters (19.70
inches), and was comprised of a surface layer of 10YR 4/3 sandy loam followed by a stratum
of 10YR 4/6 sandy loam and another stratum of 7.5YR 5/8 sandy clay with inclusions of
coarse gravel (Figure 3). Survey crew began to space the shovel tests 200 meters (656 feet)
apart while offsetting the transects 100 meters (328 feet). This was due to the determination
that this area was low in the probability for containing cultural resources. Previous surveys
supported this determination (Pickering and Hughey 2006).
26

AREA B-3
Survey Area B-3 was the eastern-most section of the eastern portion of the study area
(Figure 2). It occupied an area measuring approximately 5.55 hectares (13.70 acres) in size.
A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated along 8 transects. A typical shovel test (E:2), was
excavated to a maximum depth of 70 centimeters (27.60 inches), and was comprised of a
surface layer of 10YR 5/2 loamy sand underlain by strata of 7.5YR 5/6 sand and sandy clay
with many gravel inclusions (Figure 3). Inclusions of gravel were found throughout. No
cultural material was found.

AREA B-4
Survey Area B-4 was the northeastern portion located in the eastern section of the
study area and covered approximately 13.95 hectare (34.47 acres) (Figure 2). A total of 23
shovel tests were excavated along 9 transects during the intensive pedestrian survey of this
area. A typical shovel test (D:1), was excavated to a maximum depth of 95 centimeters
(37.40 inches), and was comprised of a surface layer of 10YR 4/3 sand followed by a stratum
of 10YR 4/6 compact sandy loam with approximately 10 - 15% gravel inclusions throughout.
This was followed by 5YR 4/6 sandy clay (Figure 3). No cultural material was found.

AREA B-5
Survey Area B-5 was in the southern portion of the eastern section of the study area,
under Area B-1 and on the west side of B-2 (Figure 2). It occupied an area measuring
approximately 10.90 hectares (26.94 acres) in size. A total of 18 shovel tests were excavated
along 7 survey transects. A typical shovel test (F:1), was excavated to a maximum depth of 1
meter (3.28 feet), and was comprised of a surface layer of 10YR 5/2 loamy sand underlain by
a stratum of 10YR 6/4 fine loose sand (Figure 3). No cultural material was found.

CHAPTER VII. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey
conducted on 90.65 hectares (224 acres) of property proposed for the construction of a
residential development in Montgomery County, Texas.
Initial investigation consisted of a background literature and site files search to
identify the presence of recorded sites in close proximity to the current project area.
Previously recorded archaeological sites were not identified within the project area. Seven
previously identified prehistoric archaeological sites were recorded within 1.6 kilometers (1
mile) of the project area.
Field investigation consisted of pedestrian reconnaissance, shovel testing, , and
photo-documentation. Subsurface investigation included the initial excavation of 339 shovel
tests in previously undisturbed and disturbed areas to depths ranging between 30 to 100
centimeters (11.81 to 39.37 inches). A total of 27 additional shovel tests were excavated
during cultural resource delineation, bringing the total of excavated shovel tests to 366.
During this investigation, 7 previously unrecorded cultural resources were located
within the project area. These resources consisted of isolated finds (Isolates #1 through 5)
and low density lithic scatters (Sites 41MQ212 and 41MQ213). All of these sites were
recorded along the ridges and hill slopes approaching either White Oak Creek or one of its
unnamed tributaries. No cultural features were observed in association with these sites.
As in Pickering and Hughey (2006), soils observed in the project area resemble
descriptions published in soil data for this portion of Montgomery County. The presence of
water-worn gravels and alluvial sediments indicate that lateral alteration to local stream
channels and down cutting have been important natural processes impacting this landscape.
Holocene-age soils appear to have been severely depleted and disturbed by these processes as
well as by mechanical logging that took place in the past, as evidenced by remnants of
logging roads throughout the property. The presence of artifacts within the disturbed
colluvial and alluvial deposits, the low density of observed cultural material, and a lack of
cultural features all indicate that these sites have been dramatically impacted by postdepositional alterations.
Most likely, alteration resulted from natural erosion and
redeposition, perhaps by slumping and soil transport from periodic high velocity flood
events, and the action of springs, seeps, and intermittent rivulets, all of which can affect the
archaeological context of deposits. Based on those results deep testing was not deemed
necessary during this survey. Previous deep testing showed a lack of intact cultural deposits
overall due to the impacts mentioned above. Also, cultural materials were located at shallow
depths within the range of shovel testing.

ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS
Following Section 106 of the NHPA, any federal undertaking must take into account
its effect on historic resources, i.e., architectural or archaeological properties on or eligible
for the NRHP. Once resources are identified within the project’s APE, they must be
evaluated for their National Register eligibility (Advisory Council for Historic Preservation
1999).
When an archaeological site has been discovered, a major goal associated with any
archaeological evaluation is to make recommendations concerning the eligibility of the
resource for the NRHP. Archaeological resources are most frequently evaluated for
eligibility in regard to Criterion D: information potential.
For a site to be considered eligible for the NRHP under Criterion D, it must possess
information bearing on an important scientific research question. Important research
questions commonly involve testing new or former hypotheses regarding topics in the natural
sciences and/or addressing aspects of the cultural chronology of a region. This information
must be evaluated within the framework of an historic context, meaning, the researcher must
be able to address how the information contained within the resource is likely to effect
current understanding of a particular time period (United States Department of the Interior
[USDI] 1983:II-26, 1991:21). In order for an archaeological resource to be considered
significant, it generally must retain integrity. While sites that have been disturbed through
natural or cultural processes can still be eligible if their undisturbed portions contain
significant information potential, sites that have lost their stratigraphic context are commonly
considered to have lost integrity of location (USDI 1983:II-26, 1991:23, 49).
A comparison of published soils data (McClintock et al 1972) with Abbott (2001)
supports an assessment that deeply buried Holocene alluvium is not present over the vast
majority of the project area; the survey crew encountered mainly either Conroe, Boy, or
Blanton soils, all of which are composed of sandy ancient alluvium and considered by Abbott
to have a low geoarcheological potential for intact cultural resources (Abbott 2001; 22, Table
2).
In a previous survey located adjacent to the current project area, soils considered by
Abbott (2001) to have a high potential for cultural materials were found in elongated
stretches along creek margins, between natural levees and the (pre-Holocene) uplands
(Pickering and Hughey 2006). Those soils are frequently flooded, and likely unsuitable for
long-term human habitation.
It is not surprising that this investigation recorded a series of low-density sites on
ridges and hill slopes approaching the nearby creek and its tributary. However, due to low
artifact density, limited artifact types, and lack of integrity of nearby sites, HRA Gray & Pape
recommends that these sites are not eligible for inclusion on the National Register. HRA
29

Gray & Pape also recommends that no further investigation be required in the project area,
and that the project be allowed to proceed as planned.
