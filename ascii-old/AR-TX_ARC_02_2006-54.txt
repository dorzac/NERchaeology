ABSTRACT
The North Texas Tollway Authority intends to construct approximately
6.7 miles of toll road that extends the Dallas North Tollway. The proposed
route runs from US 380 north to FM 428 and west of the town of Prosper
in Collin County, Texas. During the middle of November, 2006, AR
Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey
of the proposed toll road route. One historic site, 41COLccc, which
consists of a cistern was recorded but no prehistoric sites were found
during the archaeological survey. AR Consultants, Inc. believes that site
41COL191 is not eligible for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places because it will not provide any significant information to
the history of Collin County, Texas. In addition, the footprint of the house
and associated features has been removed; therefore, the cistern can not be
placed into any context.
Based upon the absence of prehistoric sites and site 41COL191 lacking
context, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource
investigations are unwarranted along the proposed toll road route.
However, if buried cultural materials are encountered during construction,
work should stop in that area immediately and the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission be notified.

INTRODUCTION
In late March and April 2002, AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd and Skinner 2002a) conducted
an evaluation of the archaeological potential of several road corridors that are being
considered to extend the Dallas North Tollway from US Highway 380 in west central
Collin County north to the Grayson County line. This extension is known as Section 4 of
the Dallas North Tollway. The archaeological evaluation was conducted for Halff
Associates, Inc. of Dallas, Texas, acting on behalf of the North Texas Tollway Authority
(NTTA). Based upon this evaluation, the North Texas Tollway Authority proposes to
construct approximately 6.7 miles of toll road beginning at CR 27 where it intersects US
380 and running north and terminating at CR 428 approximately 1,900 feet west of the
intersection of CR 52 and CR 428 (Figure 1). The archaeological survey of the proposed
toll road was done in November 2006 for Halff Associates, Inc. which is doing the
environmental permitting for the North Texas Tollway Authority.
On November 2, 10 and 16, 2006, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed tollway route. The archaeological
survey was being done because the North Texas Tollway Authority is a political entity of
the State of Texas and a Texas Antiquities Permit was required. The Archeology Division
of the Texas Historical Commission issued Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4294 for
this archaeological survey. In addition, since Doe Branch and a few minor drainages are
to be crossed, possible relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as
amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No. 11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the
Cultural Environment” and Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural
Properties (36CFR800), Appendix C. The purpose of the archaeological survey is
determine if cultural materials are present, make recommendations about their
significance and determine how they might be impacted.
The following report contains a brief description of the natural environment, the culture
history and then a review of previous investigations in the area. This is followed by the
research design and methodology. The results section follows. Recommendations follow
and a list of references cited concludes the report. This report was written in accordance
with the guidelines for reports developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (N.D.)
and adopted by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area in western Collin County is near the western edge of the Blackland Prairie
(Diggs, Lipscomb, and O’Kennon 1999), and it is this setting that characterizes much of
North Central Texas. The prairie is dissected by the East Fork of the Trinity River on the
eastern edge of Collin County and then by drainages that run basically west to east from
east of Frisco and empty into the East Fork or east to west from the Frisco area and drain
into the Elm Fork. Narrow bands of bottomland forest are confined to the drainages
throughout the county. For more than a century, parts of the area have been farmed
extensively. The native vegetation exists today in only a few relict prairies and woodland
habitats, the study area does not include any of these relict locations.
The geological formation mapped on the surface and otherwise underlying the study area
is the Cretaceous-aged Eagle Ford Shale. Most of the study area from US 380 north to
Celina is covered with undivided Quaternary deposits [Qu] of sand, clay, silt and gravel.
This is mostly colluvium with lesser amounts of alluvium. This includes all of the Doe
Branch Watershed (Bureau of Economic Geology 1967). Bedrock decomposition and
pedogenesis in the study area have resulted in creation of the soil association known as
the Houston Black-Houston (Hanson and Wheeler 1969: General Soil Map). The channel
of Doe Branch is mapped as frequently flooded Trinity clay (Hanson and Wheeler
1969:Sheet 16) although its banks are mapped as Houston Black clay.
Water is a limited resource in the prairie environment. Doe Branch is mapped as
perennial drainages on the SCS and the USGS maps. Brune (1981) lists no springs in the
study area.
The upland surface has been cleared of most trees and supports bermuda and other
grasses that have been invaded by mesquites. The edge of the upland and the valley
support numerous young and old trees including bois d’arc, American elm, cedar elm,
hackberry, honey locust along with various weeds and masses of greenbriars. According
to various authors, including Lynott (1979), the prairie once supported a cover of tall
grasses and was inhabited by now absent herbivores including bison and antelope.
Certainly, deer inhabited the floodplain forests, but this environment is not abundant in
the survey area.
Paleoenvironmental change is not well documented but it is summarized by Prikryl
(1993:192-193). Prior to 12,000 B.C., the climate of north central Texas was cooler and
moister than at present. Between 12,000 and 8,000 B.C., the climate became warmer and
this continued to the present, but with brief mesic periods. It is suggested that the
presence of high grass pollen and low arboreal pollen between 5550 and 1050 B.C. show
a drying with a return of arboreal pollen after 1050 BC. The later change is similar to the
environment of today. High grass pollen also occurs at approximately A.D. 450 and from
A.D. 1550 to 1650, thus also suggesting drier periods. The presence of paleosols between
A.D. 1 and 1,000 suggests an increase in moisture during this period with a return to drier
conditions after A.D. 1,000.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Over the past several decades, cultural resources investigations in north-central Texas
have varied due to the locations and types of projects carried out; therefore, the data base
of information to which new projects can be compared is limited. This is particularly true
for eastern Denton and Collin County which are located in the uplands of the Blackland
Prairie. The following culture history is derived from the monograph, “Lower Elm Fork
Prehistory”, by Daniel J. Prikryl (1990). Prikryl’s framework includes six prehistoric
periods, to which the historic Native American and European periods have been added.
Using Prikryl’s time framework, the following paragraphs present a brief description of
the culture history of the region.
Historic European
Historic Native American

6,000 B.C. to 4,000 B.C.
ca. 11,000 B.C. to 6,000 B.C.

The history of the Collin County region can be traced to as early as 8-9000 B.C. and
since that time, it appears to have been continuously occupied (Crook N.D.). The
physical evidence of past occupation in the county has been termed "cultural resources,"
and many of these resources have been of such significance that they have been
recognized, recorded and in many cases preserved (RMA/Texas 1986).
Prehistoric Native American settlement in Collin County began at least 10,000 years ago
as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points. No very early
prehistoric sites have been recorded in the county but Paleo-Indian sites have been
reported from Denton County to the west in the valley of the Elm Fork of the Trinity
River (Crook and Harris 1957; Ferring 2001; Prikryl 1990). Nevertheless, artifact
collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff and other Paleo-Indian
points from the surface of sites in the region (Meltzer and Bever 1995). The presence of
exotic, i.e., non-local, lithic resources indicates that these early people traveled a territory
where higher quality lithics were available or were involved in a system of raw material
trading. These early people hunted now extinct large game but probably also foraged off
the land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from 7,000 to 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late as
A.D. 700 to 800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the county but particularly along
the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather native foods

(Lynott 1977). Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock and scrapers are common
artifacts found on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued making and using
exotic cherts for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local
lithics for chipped stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde Gravels
(Menzer and Slaughter 1971; Byrd 1971). Larger Archaic sites have been recorded and
tested at Lake Lavon (Dawson and Sullivan 1973) and these sites are generally located on
terraces or ridges that overlook the East Fork of the Trinity. Smaller lithic scatters have
been recorded in upland areas throughout the county in conjunction with surveys of Soil
Conservation Service flood-water retarding dams and other projects (Lynott 1974;
Hughston and Lynott 1974; Peter 1990; Hunt, Peter and Allday 1991). These sites appear
to be Archaic in age but none have been thoroughly studied and their relationship to the
Lake Lavon sites is uncertain.
About A.D. 700 to 800, a major change is found in the artifacts and settlement patterning
of the prehistoric sites. Sites tend to congregate along the main stem of the East Fork of
the Trinity River. This is attributed to the drying up of the smaller tributaries. During this
period, which is known as the Late Prehistoric, Caddoan pottery from East Texas appears
as trade material along with the indigenous Nocona Plain pottery. It has been suggested
that farming may have been practiced. Arrowheads appear about this same time and
apparently the bow and arrow had been added to the hunting tools. The other interesting
thing is the appearance of large, circular pits constructed at sites along the East Fork and
its tributaries. No good explanation has been posed about the function of these features
although various authors have offered their interpretations (Stephenson 1952; Lynott
1975a and 1975b; Bruseth and Martin 1987).
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of the Collin County and the north central Texas area based on an absence
of sites with trade goods that might have been obtained from French, Spanish or English
traders (Skinner 1988). This simplistic interpretation is tied to a general drying trend and
attempts to factor in negative information generated by professional and avocational
archaeologists who have conducted numerous site surveys throughout the region (Peter,
Cliff and Green 1996:2). There is very little evidence of historic era Native American
occupation anywhere in either county although historic accounts indicate that groups
were present in the early 1800's.
European settlement in the study area began by the mid-1800's with the establishment of
the Peter's Colony after Texas independence. Collin County was established in 1846 and
the county seat was at Buckner until 1848 when it was moved to McKinney. Settlement
has continued to the present. By the turn of the century, all of the major communities had
been established and some had passed away. The best summary of the history and
prehistory of Collin County, and adjacent Denton County, is the document, An Open
Space Plan for Collin County (RMA/Texas 1986).
No major archaeological investigations have been conducted in the study area. GeoMarine, Inc. (Owens and Gibson 1999) investigated the area north of US 380 for the
Lake Chapman Water Supply Corporation but found no cultural materials. According to

the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2006), surveys by the Texas Water Development
Board found no sites near County Road 4 west of FM 439 and northwest of Prosper or
near Celina. A TxDOT survey along FM 483 near the intersection with FM 289 north of
Celina also found no sites.
Several archaeological surveys (Owen and Gibson 1999; Todd and Skinner 2002b; Todd
2004, 2005) have been conducted along Doe Branch in both Collin and Denton Counties,
Texas, but no prehistoric sites have been found. However, two historic sites (41DN532
and 533) were recorded along Doe Branch in Denton County (Todd 2005). Site 41DN532
is a historic homestead dating to the l930s and site 41DN533 consists of two
concrete/brick rings of unknown function.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The purpose of this research design is to insure that fieldwork made a contribution to the
prehistory and history of Collin County, Texas. A records review indicated no evidence
of prehistoric occupation in the survey area. However, a historic residence which is
located just south of Doe Branch on the 1930 Soil Map for Collin County, Texas may be
impacted by the proposed road route. Based on the known prehistoric and historic
archaeology of the area, we proposed the following three research questions.
The first research question concerns the prehistoric occupation of the study area.
It was predicted that upland prairie had little likelihood of having been
occupied prehistorically because of the lack of permanent water and low
biotic diversity. In addition, Uvalde gravel is presumed absent; therefore,
the presence of quarry sites is unlikely.
The second question concerns the historic occupation of the study area.
It was predicted that historic sites were likely to be located along
roadways in well drained settings that were not farmed.
The third question guided the survey work in this survey as well as any archeological
survey done.
How did past people use the land, what record of this use did they leave
behind?
In order to address the above questions, the archaeologists first reviewed the information
about the study area found in the Texas Archeological Site Atlas and the 1930s Soil Map
for Collin County published by the Soil Conservation Agency. The proposed toll road has
a right-of-way that ranges from 360 to 400 feet. Armed with the USGS map, soil map,
shovels, a camera and field notes, the archaeologists carefully inspected the ground
surface in meandering transects. They also made notes about the vegetation, soil and soil
exposure and took photographs. Since the study area is in an upland setting, shovel tests
were placed in locations that might contain cultural resources as suggested by the Council
of Texas Archeologists (2002) and adopted by the Texas Historical Commission. Shovel
tests were not dug in disturbed areas or where the soil visibility was 30 percent or more.
Shovel tests in Doe Branch’s floodplain were supplemented by augering until the auger
could not be turned by two people. The clay which could not be screened was manually
inspected for cultural resources as were the pit walls.
Backhoe trenching was not done due to the fact that none of the drainages crossed had a
well developed floodplain in which cultural materials would be buried and preserved.

RESULTS
Survey began at the intersection of US 380 and CR 27 and went north to FM 248. Shovel
tests are described generally in the text, but specific information is provided in Table 1.
Shovel test locations are plotted on Figures 4 and 7.
The proposed road corridor begins at Hwy 380 and runs north to County Road (CR) 3
The corridor is mapped as the present road, CR 27. CR27 is approximately three-fourths
of a meter higher than the plowed fields on both sides of it (Figure 1). Going north on CR
27 from Hwy 380 there are rocks the plowed field on the west side of the road. There was
probably a house on the west side of the road, before the Latimore Materials plant. The
house is gone and there is modern trash on the probable house site. After the Latimore
Materials plant, there is an unimproved pasture with hackberries and trash in it. There is a
metal gate and an abandoned hopper near the intersection of CR 27 and CR3. On the east
side of CR27, from Hwy 380, the plowed field is flat. Approximately half-way between
Hwy 380 and CR 3, unimproved pasture is present until prior to encountering CR 3
where a shiplapped house, possibly pre-WWII, is present. The residence has multiple
additions and there are junk cars in the back yard. It has metal fences on the west and
north sides, and there are barbed wire fences on the east and south sides. The proposed
road will be routed east of and around the house so it will not be impacted; however, it is
now for sale. No shovel tests were excavated in the plowed areas due to the excellent
ground visibility. Also, no shovel tests were excavated in the unimproved pasture due to
the prior disturbance from farming, upland situation and the 30 percent ground visibility.
No settings that would contain prehistoric sites were found and no historic standing
structures or features were seen either.
From CR 3 to CR 4, the proposed corridor runs through plowed pasture parallel to a dirt
two-track road until the road bends left. The proposed corridor continues north through a
plowed pasture until CR 4. Approximately half-way between the county roads is Burton
Branch. When the area was evaluated, the drainage was about a meter wide and deep
with a culvert and covered with fill. At that time, both sides of the drainage were
inspected, but no cultural resources were found. Since the evaluation, trash has been
dumped in the drainage which caused water from the Ponder sewer plant to back up. In
addition, beavers have invaded the area. From the drainage is CR 4 is plowed corn field
(Figure 3). Ground visibility was excellent in the plowed fields and no shovel tests were
excavated for that reason. No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the
ground surface and no standing historic structures or features were found.
From CR 4 to CR 5, the proposed roadway corridor is to be placed slightly west of CR
49, a caliche road, and parallels it until the second bend in the CR 49 where it is to be
placed adjacent to CR 49. At the intersection of CRs 4 and 49 there is a drainage that
appears to have been channelized at one time with running water. The drainage is about a
meter deep and two meters wide. The substrate is clay with scattered pea gravel. No
shovel tests were placed adjacent to the drainage due to disturbance from road
construction. From CR 4 to the first bend in CR 49 is unimproved pasture. Ground

visibility ranged from less than 10 to 30 percent. Trees include hackberry, elm and bois
d’arc while understory vegetation includes Johnson grass, coastal bermuda, berry vines,
saw greenriar, pawpaw, daisies and native grasses and bushes. A possible residence is
shown on the 1960 USGS map between CR 4 and the bend of the road. A wooden shed
was found, but no residence, cistern, storm cellar or historic features. At the bend of the
road, another possible historic residence is shown. A well pump that was in a cinder
block house and a gravel road leading to what appeared to be an elevated area for a house
was found. Four concrete blocks by the well house were found that might have been pads
for a windmill. Only three bricks were found in the vicinity of the possible residence. No
cistern, storm cellar or other associated features were found. Although out of the main
route, the possible residence might be impacted by collateral construction; therefore,
three shovel tests (1 through 3) were placed in the elevated area (Figure 4), but were
culturally sterile. The shovel tests encountered clay to depths of 37, 36 and 33 cm below
the ground surface, respectively. A trailer house may have been located on the elevated
area. A lone electric pole was found approximately 40 m southeast of the elevated area,
but no historic features were associated with it.

portion of the Celina, Texas 7.5’ USGS map.

From the bend of the road to CR 5 is pasture that has been recently plowed. Ground
visibility was 90 percent. No cultural materials were found on the ground surface.
However, two areas were investigated further. A possible historic residence was
investigated where CR 49 bends back to the west before turning north. The area
contained a trash deposit (Figure 5) and two wooden sheds with metal roofs. The area had
______________________________________________________________________________________

been disturbed by bulldozing since push piles were present. Since no house foundation,
cistern or storm cellar was found, it was felt that the area did not need to be recorded as a
site. A cistern was found on the west side of CR 49 about 1,390 feet south of CR 5. A
historic trash scatter in a plowed field was found west of the cistern. The cistern was
recorded a site and given site number 41COL191. A description of the site is presented
below.

Figure 5.

Historic trash scatter located east of second bend in CR 49. View is to the
north.

From CR 5 to CR 51, the proposed toll road runs through unimproved pasture, recently
planted hay fields and a corn field. Approximately 1,350 feet north of CR 5, is a recently
plowed hay field. North of the hay field is unimproved pasture that contains a field
drainage. The drainage is about 2 m wide and 1.5 m deep with a clay substrate. Water
was ponded from recent rains. The unimproved pasture contains vegetation similar to that
north of CR 4. Ground visibility in the unimproved pasture ranged from less than 10 to
60 percent. Eye-height visibility was about 20 meters. No shovel tests were placed on the
drainage’s banks due to the good ground visibility. From the unimproved pasture to the
floodplain of Doe Branch, the land is in recently plowed and planted johnson grass hay.
The proposed route will cross a knoll south of Doe Branch and the soil consists of eroded
Houston clay. Ground visibility was better than 70 percent.
A floodplain forest (Figure 6) is present from about 950 m south of Doe Branch to
approximately 20 m north of the creek. Vegetation includes prickly pear, rabbit grass,
hog bush, bois d’ arc trees, hackberry and elm trees and native grasses and shrubs.

Ground visibility ranged from 20 to 70 percent. Eight shovel tests (3 through 11) were
placed in the area from south of the intermittent channel that is beginning to form an
oxbow and on the north bank of Doe Branch (Figure 7). All of the shovel tests were
culturally sterile. Shovel tests 4 through 8 encountered clay that extended to from 73 to
107+ cm below the ground surface. Shovel test 9 uncovered 52 cm of clay that overlaid
the same clay that contained limestone pea gravel to 138 cm below the ground surface.
Shovel test10 uncovered a different clay that extended to 67+ cm below the ground
surface and shovel test 11 uncovered the same clay found in shovel tests 4 through 9 that
extended to 66 cm. Below this clay was the same clay except that limestone pea gravel
was present. Underneath the pea gravel was the same clay as in Zone I which extended
from 90 to 109+ cm below the ground surface. Doe Branch is about 2 m wide and deep.
Water was flowing in clay substrate that contained pea gravel. The channel is mapped as
containing frequently flooded Trinity clay.

Figure 6.

No backhoe trenching was done within the floodplain because we felt that the subsoil had
been encountered. In addition, the gravel encountered in ST 9 indicated that the creek
was further south at some time in the past. According to Hanson and Wheeler
(1969:Sheet 16), Doe Branch’s floodplain is mapped as eroded Houston clay. AC1
horizon is approximately 10 inches below the ground surface and is the same color as the
topsoil, the A horizon. The shallowest shovel test was 67 cm (approximately 2.25 feet)
which should have encountered both the A and AC horizon (Hanson and Wheeler
1969:18).

Shovel test locations placed in the floodplain and on Doe Branch’s banks
plotted on a portion of the Celina, Texas 7.5’ USGS map.

From Doe Branch north to CR 51 was a recently plowed corn field where ground
visibility was 90 percent. The soil is Houston Black clay. No cultural materials older than
50 years were seen on the ground surface from CR 5 to CR 51 or found in the eight
shovel tests.
From CR 51 to FM 428, the proposed toll road crosses a hay field, a mixture of
unimproved and improved pasture, improved pasture and a corn field that has recently
been plowed. Almost all of the route is east of and parallels a fence. Even in the
unimproved pasture, ground visibility was at least 50 percent, and ranged from 70 to 100
percent throughout the rest of this portion of the survey area. Deflation from plowing is
shown in Figure 8. The ground drop is where the hay field and the mixture of improved
and unimproved pasture meet. No shovel tests were placed in the Blackland upland
setting due to the excellent ground visibility and no cultural materials older than 50 years
were seen on the ground surface.

Site 41COL191
Site 41COL191 consists of a historic cistern and associated trash scatter which is
probably the remnants of the homestead that the cistern was associated with. The cistern
is 63 inches long northeast-southwest and 58 inches wide northwest-southeast. The
cistern was probably deformed into its present configuration during construction of CR
49. The cistern has a brick collar and the unmarked factory made bricks stand about 7
inches above the ground surface in the southwest corner and the rest of the bricks are at
ground level (Figure 9). The bricks standing above ground have a concrete outer
protective layer. The bricks are 4 inches wide and have been cemented together. The
bricks extend to 25 inches below the ground surface and below the bricks, the cistern
consists of flat limestone rocks that extend to 149 inches below the ground surface.
According to Speck (1979:230), there is a similarity between cisterns and wells. Cisterns,
however, are usually cone or bell-shaped, as in Figure 10. When the cistern was dug and
the walls were set, dirt was filled in around the walls and curbing was added. In addition,
underground water was probably not present for a well since no major streams are present
either to feed the underground stream or receive water from it. Although shallow water
was present within the cistern, this was a result of the recent rains prior to the
archaeological survey.

The cistern adjacent to CR 49. Note flat limestone rocks beneath bricks.

West of the cistern is a historic trash scatter that is approximately 168 feet wide east-west
and 276 feet long north-south (Figure 11). Trash within the scatter includes unmarked
factory made brick, opal and clear glass shards, metal, white porcelain shards and the top
of a clear glass screw-top bottle. Site boundaries were not defined by shovel testing due
to the excellent ground visibility which was at least 60 percent. According to Texas
Historical Commission standards, the normal six shovel tests required to define a site are
not necessary when ground visibility is greater than 30 percent.
According to the records for Collin County, Texas, Fowler Living Trust transferred the
property that the historic cistern/trash scatter is located on to Headquarters, LP on
January 16, 2004 (Volume 5589, p. 1558). Billy R. and Janice Fowler transferred the
property to the Fowler Living Trust on May, 3, 2000 (Volume 4660, p. 2306). No record
could be found for the transfer from Francis Chesney to the Fowlers; however, the
Chesney Family, LTD transferred the property to Francis Chesney on December 29, 1997
(Volume 4068, p. 3237). From here the records are sketchy. No record is available for
when the Chesney Family, LTD acquired the property. On February 17, 1959, the
property was transferred to Ruth Holder (Volume 549, p. 63) by H. E. Test, et al. Mr. J.
M. Furr transferred the property to W. K. Texas on January 1, 1918 (Volume 215, p. 7).
No record exists on who the property was acquired from by Mr. Furr, but Mr. T. H.
Twitty and A. H. Bellew acquired the property from Mr. J. D. Nance on October 25,
1892.

Conclusions
No prehistoric sites were encountered in the Blackland prairie as expected. However, one
historic site, 41COL191 was discovered west of and adjacent to CR 49. The site is a
cistern and a historic trash scatter and possibly dates to the 1930s. The associated
homestead and any other possible historic structures or features have been removed.

RECOMMENDATIONS

AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource investigations are
unwarranted based upon the absence of prehistoric sites and the disturbed historic site,
41COL191, which is an isolated historic cistern with a trash scatter. Since the cistern is
not associated with the historic homestead and other associated historic
structures/features and will not provide significant information to the prehistory or
history of not only Collin County but the State of Texas, it is felt that the site is not
eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. However, if buried
cultural materials are encountered during construction, work should stop immediately in
that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be
contacted. Work should not begin until the proper investigations have been conducted.
