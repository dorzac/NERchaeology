Archeological Investigations at
Scorpion Cave (41 ME 7)
Medina County, Texas
LYNN HIGHLEY, CAROL GRAVES, CAROL LAND
AND GEORGE JUDSON

ABSTRACT
During the early summer of 1971, archeological investigations
were conducted at the Scorpion Cave site in northeastern Medina
County, Texas. The cave is located above the western floodplain of
the Medina River in the lower level of 80-foot bluffs. Large amounts
of occupational debris were recovered from cave deposits, indicating
that the cave was occupied throughout the Archaic period and into
Late Prehistoric times. Historic materials were also present in the
cave. Studies of faunal remains from the site are provided.

INTRODUCTION
In June and July of 1971, excavations were carried out at the
Scorpion Cave site (41 ME 7), which is located on the Medina River
about .5 mile downstream from the Medina Lake Dam (Fig. 1.).
Excavations at the site were carried out by a group of amateur
archeologists, including co-authors Carol Benson Land and George
Judson. The group worked to extensively excavate archeological
deposits within the cave; they also investigated the area outside
the cave mouth, but no occupational evidence was present.
Participants in the excavations at Scorpion Cave included coauthors Land and Judson, assisted by Perry Haass, the late Maxine
Benson and Ruth Judson. Carol Land kept a diary of the proceedings, including excavation notes and maps. Site photographs were
taken by Pete Farmer.

Co-authors Graves and Highley were not present during the
excavation. Therefore, the discussion of excavation procedures, as
well as many portions of the remainder of the paper, is based upon
excavators’ notes supplemented by input from George Judson.
The authors would like to acknowledge the advice and
criticism of Thomas R. Hester. His help was invaluable and greatly
appreciated. We would also like to thank Thomas C. Kelly for
assistance with artifact photography and identification; Anne A.
Fox for historic artifact identification and suggestions on various
aspects of the paper; Richard McCeehee for information on the
geological composition of various artifacts; Sam Nesmith for identification of cartridge cases; and John S. Graves, Jr. for assistance
with site maps and photographs. We would also like to acknowledge those who participated in the 1971 excavations upon which
this report is based.

ARCHEOLOGICALBACKGROUND
Less than 30 prehistoric sites have been recorded in Medina
County. Patterson (1975) has studied the blade technology at
quarry site 41 ME 3, and has recorded sites 41 ME 9-17, all in
northern Medina County (Hester and Kelly 1976). In 1976, the
Center for Archaeological Research, The University of Texas at
San Antonio, excavated four sites (41 ME 18-21) near Natalia,
which is located in southeast Medina County (ibid). In 1975, the
Texas Historical Commission carried out historic site excavations
at the Landmark Inn in Castroville (see Hester 1975a). Little else is
known about the archaeology of Medina County. Suhm (1960)
should be consulted for a general overview of the archeology of the
central Texas region.
Four major chronological periods can be discerned in central
and south central Texas prehistory. The Paleo-Indian period (ca.
9200-6000 B.C.) is represented primarily by random finds of dart
points such as Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, and Golondrina (see
Sollberger and Hester 1972; Hester 1971). Five Folsom points were
found in the backdirt left by looters at the Kincaid site in nearby
Uvalde County (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks 1954; Sellards 1952;
Wormington 1957). A Plainview point was found eroding from a
bluff upstream from Scorpion Cave (George Judson and Harvey
Smith, Jr., personal communication). Several Plainview points were
recovered during 1977 excavations at the St. Mary’s Hall site

{Hester 1978; see also Hester 1975b and Cantu, Lauderdale and
Stoner 1976).
The Archaic period (ca. 6000 B.C.-A.D. 500/1000) is represented by numerous sites containing a great variety of dart
points, bifaces and unifaces, and by the appearance of grinding
stones. Burned rock middens are also characteristic of this time
span. The current state of the Texas Archaic has been reviewed
in a group of papers edited by Hester [1976). For information on
internal divisions of the Archaic, Johnson, Suhm, and Tunnell
(1962) should be consulted. Weir (1976) has synthesized recent
data on the Central Texas Archaic and has proposed an alternative chronological sequence. Many of the projectile points from
Scorpion Cave date to the Archaic period. Near the cave are
several burned rock middens.

The Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 500/1000-historic contact)
is characterized by the appearance of arrow points and pottery.
Most of the projectile points from Scorpion Cave date to this
period. No pottery was recovered, but the presence of clay
nodules was noted; field records do not indicate whether or not
these were baked.
The Historic period begins with the arrival of the
Europeans. Sites dating from this period include missions,
ranches, and structures built by the early settlers. Other than
Spanish mission sites in which Indian quarters are found, very
few sites representing historic Indian groups have been recorded
(Hester 1975b).
An ethnographic summary of central Texas Indian groups
has been prepared by Newcomb (1973). The

culture

of the

Payaya, a Coahuilteco-speaking group of the south central Texas
area, has been described by Campbell (1975). Included in this
paper is information about the protohistoric lifeway of Payaya
tribes along the Medina River, south of Scorpion Cave.
Ethnohistoric accounts researched by Campbell refer to groups
camping on the Medina River, near the present boundary between Medina and Bexar Counties. Pecan groves along the
Medina River and the abundance of game, especially bison,
seemed to account for Payaya encampments in this area.

THE SETTING
The site is situated 150 yards west of the present channel of
the Medina River. The cave mouth faces east, with an old river
channel situated halfway between the cave and the present river
channel. The site is within the Medina Canyon, which is about
116 miles in length, extending from Bandera County southeast
into Bexar County (Fig. 2, A).
The cave mouth sits about 20 feet above the present river
level, with bluffs rising approximately 80 feet above the cave
(Fig. 2, B). On the opposite bank of the river are gravel terraces
and a lower river bluff.
The floodplain is characterized by a heavy vegetation cover.
Trees are represented by many large elm, pecan, poplar, and
live oak in the floodplain, with cypress and willow along the
river. Also present are cedar, laurel, buckeye, walnut, persimmon, and hackberry. Plants include guajillo, agarita, yucca,
kinikinik, numerous grape vines, and assorted weeds and
flowers. There are also a variety of native grasses.
The cave is located in the northeast section of Medina
County. The northern portion of the county is hilly and broken
along the Balcones Escarpment. The site is on the southwestern
edge of the Edwards Plateau, a rugged area of Comanchean
Cretaceous limestone dissected by numerous rivers and stream
beds of the area. The remainder of Medina County is rolling,
partly brush-covered, with some fertile valleys. The site is also
within the southern portion of the Balconian Biotic Province
(Blair 1950: 112-115). The climate of the Balconian is semiarid
and mesothermal, with rainfall decreasing from east to west.
Average annual precipitation in Medina County varies from 28
to 30 inches (Carr 1967: 4). Mean temperature range is 42 to 96
degrees, with altitude varying from 600-1900 feet (Texas
Almanac 1976-1977: 333).
The Medina River rises in northwestern Bandera County,
flowing southeast to the San Antonio River, and having a length
of 116 miles. It is a springfed stream (ibid: 117). According to
Blair (1950), "The floodplains of the streams are occupied by a
mesic forest of large live oaks, elms, hackberries and pecans.
Along the Medina River, in the southeastern part of the
province, large cypress trees (Taxodium distichum) fringe the

144

stream course." This description is characteristic of the Scorpion Cave environment.

THE CAVE
The mouth of Scorpion Cave faces east, toward the Medina
River, which flows generally north to south. The floodplain
slopes upward from the river to the cave mouth, which is located
some 150 yards west of the river and approximately 20 feet
above present water level. However, the old river channel is only

75 yards east of the cave.
The mouth of the cave measures 19 feet at maximum (Fig. 3,
A). The cave interior consists of a roughly circular area extending 17 feet into the bluff; the maximum height of this room is
approximately 6 feet. A shelf of about 1.5 feet in height extends
along the south wall of the room. From this outermost room, a
passageway of 7 feet maximum width runs 20 feet at a 30
degree angle to the opening (Fig. 3, B). The shelf continues along
the south side of this passage, with another shelf along the
opposite wall. At the end of the passage, a second passage 6 feet
in width extends for another 19.5 feet at a 90° angle from the
first. Then, a third passage, of 4 feet maximum width, continues
for 17 feet at a 30° angle from the second. The cave ends at this
point. Between the second and third passages is a larger area, 7
feet wide and 6 feet high; a chimney (with a slight updraft) found
in the ceiling of this area extends upward into the bluff above.
(See Fig. 4 for diagram of cave interior.)

EXCAVATION PROCEDURES
Excavations were carried out in the outermost circular area
of the cave and in the first passageway (see Fig. 4), as well as
outside the cave mouth. The basic excavation strategy was
"vertically-oriented". Units were laid out in four-foot squares
wherever feasible; contours of the cave necessitated differentlyshaped units in some areas. Excavations were carried out in sixinch arbitrary levels. All excavated materials were passed
through 1¼,, mesh and were bagged according to unit and level.
Large amounts of charcoal, chert debris, bone, snail and mussel
shell were saved along with all artifacts.

Many large rocks in front of the cave mouth were removed
to facilitate excavations. Portions of the deposit in units located
across the mouth were derived from spalling of the cave ceiling;
consistency was that of a fine powder and it was gray in color.
Toward the front of these units the deposits were comprised of a
dark humus soil and burned rock. Medium-sized land snails
prevalent in the cave probably represent a food source for
prehistoric inhabitants.
As excavations proceeded, large rock spalls from the cave
ceiling were uncovered in the units. A red clay gravel was
reached in some areas at the lower levels. Several hearths were
uncovered in the outermost circular room at depths of approximately 36 inches; associated artifacts found nearby may be
the result of knapping sessions around a fire, with heattreatment of raw materials a part of the knapping process.

DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTIFACTS
The excavations at Scorpion Cave resulted in the recovery
of 682 prehistoric artifacts. The following broad categories were
established through the analysis of the specimens: Chipped Stone
Artifacts (including Projectile Points, Other Bifaces and
Unifaces), Painted Artifacts, Ground and Pecked Stone Artifacts,
Bone Artifacts and Shell Artifacts. The various classes of artifacts in each of these categories will be described in the
following section. Projectile points were generally sorted according to the typology of Suhm, Krieger and Jelks (1954). All
measurements are in millimeters with incomplete measurements
in parentheses. Dimensions are indicated by the following abbreviations: L: length; MW: maximum width; MT: maximum
thickness; SL: stem length; SW: stem width; and NW: neck width.
WT: weight, is in grams, and is given for complete specimens
only. Vertical provenience data are provided in Table 3. Terminology used in the projectile point descriptions is defined by
the sketch in Figure 5.

& 8). The predominant point type at

Scorpion Cave, these points are characterized by deep corner notches, a broad
concave base, and a stem as wide or wider than the shoulders. The triangular
blades are straight or slightly concave; many are serrated. Edwards points were
first described by ]. B. Sollberger (1967). He believes that the Edwards point was
the first arrow point form in the Edwards Plateau region and was patterned after
dart point forms, such

as

Frio, Ensor, Fairland, Martindale, Pedernales, and

Uvalde. A discussion incorporating new data on the type followed a few years
later (Hester 1970). In this paper and a subsequent site report (Hester 1971),
Edwards points recovered at the La ]ita site in northeastern Uvalde County were
described. The 1977 UTSA Archaeological Field Course recovered a number of
Edwards points at the St. Mary’s Hall site, 41 BX 229 (Hester 1978), and they
were also found during an extensive survey of the Camp Bullis area in northern
Bexar County (Gersfle, Kelly and Assad 1978). Radiocarbon data for Edwards
points have been obtained from two sites. A date of A.D. 1054 was assigned to a
stratum containing Edwards points at a site on Camp Bullis (ibid); dates of A,D.
960 and A.D. 930 come from the La ]ita site (Hester 1971). The Edwards type
represents 75%

of the arrow point total recovered from Scorpion Cave. Table 1

presents the measurements for the Edwards points from Scorpion Cave; weight is
included for complete specimens only.

FRESNO (5 specimens; Fig. 6, b-d). Two specimens are basal fragments; the
remainder are substantially complete. Bases range from slight convexity to slight
concavity. The triangular points are very thin, well-made specimens. L: (18-29);
MW: 15-21; MT: 3-4; WT: .7-1.2.
PERDIZ (5 specimens; Fig. 6, e-h). All of the specimens are fragmentary. Two
are worked unifacially except for bifacial flaking on the stems. Two have serrated
edges. L: (19-36.5); MW: 11.5-18.5; MT: 3-4; SL: 10-12; NW: 6.5-7.
SCALLORN (16 specimens; Fig. 6, i-v). Eight of these are essentially complete.
Bodies vary from broad to slender with edges slightly concave to slightly convex.
Stems are expanding, with bases varying from slight convexity to concavity. Body
edges of several specimens are finely serrated. Workmanship is generally good.
Measurements of essentialy complete specimens are: L: 23-27; MW: 13-31; MT:
2.5-5; SL: 4-6; SW: 10-17; NW: 6-11; WT: .7-2.2.
UNFINISHED (2 specimens; Fig. 9, a-b). One specimen appears complete but
probably represents an unfinished point since only one side has been notched. L:
45; MW: 16; MT: 4.5; SL: 6; SW: 7.5; NW: 10. The other specimen is the basal
fragment of a preform made on a flake. The preform has been side-notched; one
lateral edge has been bifacially trimmed, the other edge has been trimmed
unifacially. L: (27); MW: 18.5; MT: 3.5; SL: 7; SW: 12; NW: 9.
FRAGMENTS (116 specimens). Thirteen partial basal fragments are probably
broken Edwards points. Another basal fragment is probably a broken Scallorn

point. Eleven other arrow point fragments could not be classified. Sixty-eight
distal fragments and 23 medial fragments were also recovered. Most of these
arrow point fragments were in the upper three levels. Not illustrated.

DART POINTS
A total of 71 dart points was found; types included Bulverde, Castroville,
Early Triangular, Ensor, Frio, Kinney, Langtry, Marcos, Marshall, Martindale,
Montell, Nolan, Palmillas, Pedernales, Travis and Wells, as well as several
specimens that do not fit within existing taxonomy. Unfinished dart points and
dart point fragments are also described.
BULVERDE (1 specimen; Fig. 10, a). This incomplete specimen has only a
partial body, probably broken in manufacture, which is slightly convex. The stem
is contracting with a slightly convex base. L: (44); MW: 35; MT: 7; SL: 19; SW: 14;

barbed. The basal edge is slightly concave. L: (36.5); MW: (37.5); MT: (5); SL: 16;
SW: 11.5; NW: 13.5
MARCOS (2 specimens; Fig. 10, i-j). These incomplete specimens have
triangular bodies, one very broad, with straight edges. The stems are strongly
expanding with a straight base on the broader specimen, a slightly concave base
on the other. L: (36-37); MW: 30-35; MT: 7; SL: 8-9; SW: 13-26.5.

patinated specimen exhibits crude workmanship. L: 49; MW: 22; MT: 8.5; SL: 21;
SW: 18.5; WT: 9.4.
PALMILLAS (1 specimen; Fig. 12, a). This complete specimen has a narrow
triangular body with slightly convex edges. The stem is expanding with a straight
base. Body edges are serrated; workmanship is good. L: 42; MW: 17; MT: 5; SL:
6.5; NW: 11; WT: 2.9.
PEDERNALES (13 specimens; Fig. 12, b-j). The specimens are morphologically
diverse. Only six are complete; several appear to be unfinished and were probably broken in manufacture. Bodies vary from triangular to leaf-shaped, with
straight or convex edges. Barbs are present on three of the points. Stems are 1/41/3 of total length. Variation from slight to deep concavity is present on the bases.
Workmanship varies from very good to crude, the latter possibly reflecting the
incomplete manufacturing stage of these points. Basal thinning frequently consists
of a single channel flake removed from the center of the base on both faces of the
stem. L: (36)-104; MW: 27-42.5; MT: 6-9; SL: 12-27; SW: 16-27; NW: 15-25; WT:
8.3-21.6.
TRAVIS (1 specimen; Fig. 12, k). This specimen has a triangular body with
slight rounded shoulders. The base is slightly convex. L: (52); MW: 25; MT: 7; SL:
12; SW: 14; NW: 16.
WELLS (1 specimen; Fig. 12, 1). This complete specimen has a slender
triangular body, small shoulders, and a long stem with rounded base. It is heavily
patinated. L: 61; MW: 21; MT: 8; SL: 24; SW: 15.5.

UNCLASSIFIED DART POINTS
The following dart points do not fit into any currentlydefined type.
GROUP 1 (1 specimen; Fig. 13, a). This point cannot be placed within the
existing taxonomy. The lateral edges are alternately beveled, resulting in a very
sharp point. The specimen has a convex base and broad corner notches. L: 57;
MW: 25; MT: 7; SL: 14; SW: 21; NW: 15; WT: 6.8.
GROUP 2 (2 specimens). This group consists of the stems of two dart points.
They have concave bases, but are not identifiable. They are too fragmentary for
measurement.

UNFINISHED DART POINTS
These eight points were abandoned at different stages in the
manufacturing process. They are divided into six groups.
GROUP 1 (1 specimen, not illustrated). This specimen has corner notches. The
body has pronounced convex edges. One side has traces of cortex on it. L: (35.5);
MW: 31.5; MT: 15.5; SL: 9.5.; SW: 18; NW: 18; WT: 9.7.

body flares out to a concave base; there is no stem. L: (51.5); MW: 34.5; MT: 8.5.
GROUP 3 (1 specimen, not illustrated). One fragmentary specimen consists
mainly of a base. One lateral edge has a side notch. The base is convex. L: (30);
MW: 35.5; MT: 8; SL: (1.5); SW: 50.3; NW: 29.
GROUP 4 (1 specimen, not illustrated). This fragmentary specimen is absent
the distal tip and part of the stem. It has a slight side notch on the intact side. The
base is concave; the lateral edges of the body are slightly convex. L: (45.5); MW:
(32.5); MT: 6; SL: (12); SW: (19.5); NW: (22).
GROUP 5 (1 specimen, not illustrated). This basal fragment has convex edges
and a long contracting stem with a concave base. L: (38.5); MW: 26.5; MT: 7.6;
SL: 16; SW: 16; NW: 18.
GROUP 6 (2 specimens; Fig. 13, c-d). These specimens have broad side
notches and the body has straight to slightly convex lateral edges. One has a
slightly convex basal edge; the other has a concave basal edge, with the tops of
the stem broken off. It is patinated and has a beveled stem. L: (54.5-57); MW: 3132; MT: 10-10.5; SL: 13.5-(14); SW: (20-23); NW: 19-19.5; WT: 15.4-17.0.

DART POINT OR LARGE BIFACE FRAGMENTS
The majority of these (84 specimens; not illustrated) seem to
be dart point fragments. There are 27 distal fragments, 26
medial fragments, and 31 miscellaneous fragments that are too
burned or broken to identify. Several medial fragments have part
of a shoulder remaining. Several of the fragments are patinated.

DART POINT PREFORMS
This

category

includes

134 bifacially

chipped

artifacts,

excluding projectile points, which are probably projectile point
preforms. Of this number, only 36 are substantially complete
specimens. On several of these cortex remains on one face
which may have been impossible for the knapper to remove,
resulting in their discard. A few of the basal fragments were
complete enough to sort into groups 1-8 with the complete
specimens, but most basal, medial, and distal sections were too
fragmentary to divide morphologically. Eleven groups are
described below.
GROUP 1 (2 specimens; Fig. 14, a, b). Narrow lanceolate outlines; the face of
one specimen has a thick lateral ridge with parallel flaking to either side of this
ridge. Fair workmanship. Straight to slightly convex bases. L: 65-69; MW: 21-24;
MT: 10-11.
GROUP 2 (3 specimens; Fig. 14, c, d). Ovate with convex bases. One is made
on a flake, with cortex covering the lower half of one face. L: 50-70; MW: 36.5-56;
MT: 12-13.
GROUP 3 (8 specimens; Fig. 14, e, f). Asymmetrical but generally ovate

SCORPION CAVE ARCHEOLOGY

165

outline and convex bases. Crude; two are badly scarred and poflidded. L: 40-64;
MW: 30.5-49; MT: 6-10.
GROUP 4 (11 specimens; Fig. 14, g, h). Triangular with straight to convex
bases. Thick and crude with some cortex remaining on most. Distal tip absent on
four specimens. L: 50-84; MW: 33-53; MT: 12-22.
GROUP 5 (7 specimens; Fig. 14, i, j). Triangular with straight edges and
slightly convex bases. Two are basal fragments; two are badly potlidded. One
specimen narrows sharply at the proximal end. Fair workmanship. L: 50-69; MW:
27.5-43; MT: 7-11.
GROUP 6 (12 specimens; Fig. 14, k, 1}. Triangular with convex bases and
edges. Two have missing tips; another three are basal fragments. Fair workmanship. L: 47-81; MW: 32-46; MT: 7-11.
GROUP 7 {6 specimens; Fig. 15, a, b). Small triangular outline; bases straight
to convex; crude workmanship. L: 41.5-53; MW: 27-30; MT: 7-10.
GROUP 8 (3 specimens; Fig. 15, c). Residual category. Very crude. One has
mostly cortex on one face and is rectangular with perforator-like tip. Others are
roughly triangular; one has cortex at the distal end; the other is badly poflidded.
The remaining three groups are bifacially worked artifacts too fragmentary
to classify more definitively.
GROUP 9 (22 specimens). Basal fragments. Several specimens are thinned
and exhibit fair workmanship. Others are crude and still have cortex remaining
on one or both faces. One specimen was made on a biface thinning flake. Several
specimens are poflidded; some are patinated. Not illustrated.
GROUP 10 {18 specimens). Medial fragments. Broken at various stages of
manufacture. Most of the medial sections are small. Not illustrated.
GROUP 11 (42 specimens). Distal fragments. Wide range in size, workmanship and stage of manufacture. Some with cortex, patination, and/or potlidding.
Not illustrated.

Both

are

triangular in outline with moderately concave bases. Body edges are serrated;
workmanship is fair to good. These bifaces, from levels 2 and 3, were probably
utilized as knives. L: (79-110); MW: 31-41; MT: 6-10.
LARGE THINNED BIFACE (1 specimen; Fig. 13, g). This large but relatively
thin specimen was apparently broken during manufacture. Both halves were found
in Unit 1, the distal end in level 1 and the proximal end in level 2. Workmanship is good. L (combined halves): 121; MW: 60; MT: 12.
PERFORATOR (1 specimeni Fig. 13, h). This specimen has a rounded ovate
base with a long shaft. The tip is absent. L: 66; MW: 44; MT: 11; L (of shaft): 35.
BEVELED KNIFE (I specimen; Fig. 13, i). This medial fragment is alternately
beveled

along the

edges.

This

type of knife

dates to the

Late

Prehistoric (Hester and Parker 1970). A complete specimen was found on the
natural shelf in the cave but was not available for analysis. L: (36.5); MW: (23.5);
MT: (6).
CHOPPER [1 specimen; Fig.16, d). Several broad flakes have been removed
bifacially from one end of the cobble, forming a convex edge. The proximal end is
covered with cortex. L: 90; MW: 83.5; MT: 42.

CRUDE BIFACES. These differ from those artifacts in the preform category in
that the former represent crude percussion as opposed to controlled percussion
and some pressure flaking on the latter. Seven groups of thick, percussion-chipped
bifaces are described below.
GROUP 1 (6 specimens; Fig. 15, d). Ovate outlines. Thick, crude. Large flake
scars. Cortex on one or both faces. L: 63-85; MW: 46-70; MT: 18-38.
GROUP 2 (7 specimens; Fig. 5, e-f). Ovate outlines. Thick, crude. Large flake
scars. Cortex on one or both faces. L: 63-85; MW: 46-70; MT: 18-38.
GROUP 3 (2 specimens; Fig. 15, g). Small, ovate. Cortex on one face. L: 53-54;
MW: 34-44; MT: 14-16.
GROUP 4 (2 specimens; Fig. 15, h). Thinner; ovate outline. Cortex on one or
both faces. One is fire-fractured. L: 69-73; MW: 52-60; MT: 11-14.
GROUP 5 (1 specimen; Fig. !5, i). Very large ovate biface. No cortex
remaining. L: 96; MW: 81; MT: 21.
GROUP 6 (1 specimen; Fig. 15, j). Asymmetrical. Made on a flake. Cortex
remaining on each end. L: 51; MW: 46; MT: 13.
GROUP 7 (4 specimens). Fragmentary. Crude, some fire-fractured. Not illustrated.
CORES AND CORE FRAGMENTS (12 specimens). All have had flakes
removed bifacially. All but two have cortex remaining. On one of these, blade-like
flakes have been removed. Most of these specimens are natural platform cores. L:
55-81; MT: 23-40.

UNIFACES
RETOUCHED BLADES (5 specimens). By definition, a blade is a long, narrow
flake, the length being at least twice the width. One or more lateral ridges occur
on the dorsal surface. These five specimens show a series of patterned flake scars
along one or both edges. Two of the blades show only slight modification. One
blade has been retouched bifacially along one edge and unifacially on the other
edge. This blade is sharply pointed and twisted. Two blades are retouched
unifacially along both lateral edges. Use-wear analysis of blades from the central
and southern coast has shown that retouched blades were most often used as
cutting tools or knives, rather than as scrapers (Hester and Shafer 1975). L: 510.5; MW: 1-5; MT: .5-1.
UTILIZED BLADES (4 specimens). The edges of these blades have been
slightly modified by use-wear.
RETOUCHED FLAKES (29 specimens). These flakes have been finely
retouched along one or several edges. They have been divided into the following
categories.
FORM 1 (1 specimen). This secondary flake has been alternately retouched
along the lateral edges. L: 7; MW: 4; MT: 1.5.
FORM 2 (2 specimens). These two secondary flakes have been trimmed along
the lateral edges producing a pointed flake. L: 7-7.5; MW: 5-7.5; MT: 2-2.5.
FORM 3 [7 specimens). These have been retouched along most of the flake
perimeter. Three interior flakes have been trimmed unifacially; the four secondary flakes have been trimmed bifacially. L: 4.5-9.5; MW: 2-5; MT: .5-2.
FORM 4 (6 specimens). These flakes have been trimmed unifacially along
both lateral edges. Three of the flakes are interior; three are secondary. L: 5-10.5;
MW: 3-6.5; MT: 1-2.

FORM 5 (3 specimens}. These secondary flakes have been retouched along
the lateral edges as well as along the end opposite the bulb of percussion. L: 4.55.5; MW: 3-6.5; MT: 1-1.5.
FORM 6 {8 specimens}. These flakes have been retouched unilaterally. Six
are secondary flakes; two are primary flakes. L: 3.5-12; MW: 2.5-6.5; MT: 1-2.
FORM 7 {2 specimens}. One secondary flake has been trimmed unilaterally;
the opposite edge is cortex. The platform end has also been trimmed. The other
flake has cortex along the platform end and along one lateral edge, The opposite
edge and the end opposite the platform end have been retouched. L: 6.5-20.5;
MW: 3-5.5; MT: 1-1.5.
SCRAPERS (7 specimens}. These artifacts represent tools which have a steep
bit edge or edges. Five are unifacial; one is biracial.
side scraper (1 specimen}. This specimen has been retouched unilaterally. L:
74; MW: 33; MT: 12.
end and side scrapers (3 specimens; Fig. 16, a, c}. One specimen is complete;
two are broken. On each specimen, one lateral edge has been retouched as well
as the end opposite the bulb of percussion. L: 62-97.5; MW: 37-88; MT: 12-27.5.
27.5.
double end and side scraper (1 specimen; Fig. 16, b}. This specimen has been
flaked along both lateral edges as well as the end opposite the bulb of percussion.
L: 76; MW: 43; MT: 12.5.
irregular scrapers (2 specimens}. These specimens are irregularly shaped.
The fragmentary unifacial scraper is trimmed along the perimeter. The bifacial
flake is alternately trimmed along the lateral edges, one of which is concave. The
end opposite the bulb of percussion has the steep-bit edge. L: 40.5-94; MW: 37-62;
MT: 8-16.

PAINTED ARTIFACTS
PAINTED PEBBLES (3 specimens; Fig. 17, a-c}. These pebbles show evidence
of black linear decoration. One oblong pebble has several intersecting black lines
painted on it; the design is very dim (L: 57; MW: 33; MT: 10}. A second oblong
specimen has three black parallel lines running lengthwise down the center of one
face {L: 53; MW: 32; MT: 19}. A third light brown oblong pebble has two black
parallel lines running the width of one face, slightly off-center; there are also
patches of red paint on this face (L: 63; MW: 35; MT: 20}. The occurrence of
painted pebbles in central Texas is very rare. A painted pebble was recovered
from Classen Rockshelter, 41 BX 23 (Fox and Fox, unpublished manuscript on file
at the Center for Archaeological Research, The University of Texas at San Antonio}. This specimen had black paint on one end; a design was not distinguishable. At the Goodrich Site, a waterworn limestone slab had red parallel lines
painted on both faces (Suhm 1960}. Hester {1977} recently reported a painted
pebble with red linear decorations from Zavala County in south Texas.
STAINED STONES {3 specmens; Fig. 17, d}. One oblong specimen, as well as
an ovate and a broken specimen, has reddish colorations on one or both faces.
They were probably used to grind hematite. A conglomeration of a reddish
material identified by Dr. Richard V. McGehee as hematite was also found in the
deposits. This material is not native to the immediate area. (oblong specimen, L:
83; MW: 40; MT: 18; ovate specimen, L: 75; MW: 69; MT: 13).

GROUND AND PECKED STONE ARTIFACTS
PITTED STONES (3 specimens; Fig. 17, e). All three specimens are limestone
and have a circular pitted area centrally located on both faces. Two stones are
ovate, while the larger stone is rectangular. Similar artifacts have been described
by Skinner (1971) and Word (1971). L: 85-138; MW: 68-91; MT: 43-60.5.
HAMMERSTONES (2 specimens). The smaller chert hammerstone evidences
battering on both ends. The larger hammerstone, made of limestone, shows
battering on only one side. L: 67-97; MW: 45-82.5; MT: 40-66. Not illustrated.
MANOS (2 specimens). Both are fragmentary and are made of limestone. The
larger mano is ovate with wear facets on only one face. The other is fragmentary
but appears to have been ovate in outline. It has wear facets on both faces. L:
35.5-79.5; MW: 75-80.5; MT: 38.5-48.5. Not illustrated.

BONE ARTIFACTS
BONE AWLS (8 specimens; Fig. 18, a-f). Four awls have been manufactured
from the split bones of a deer. Similar awls have been recovered from Baker Cave
and Red Mill Shelter (Word 1971). Word states that they do not need to be altered
to be useful as a tool. Three of the specimens show no alteration; one has been
sharply pointed (L: 44-54). Four broken awl tips were also recovered. Two are
burned; all evidence polishing. The top of one appears to be fire-hardened. L: 2056; MW: 5.5-12; MT: 2.5-4.5
DEER ULNA FLAKING TOOL (1 specimen; Fig. 18, g). The distal end has
been broken off. Well-defined scratches are visible along the sides of the
specimen, apparently used as a flaking tool. L: 77; MW: 30; MT: 13.5.
BONE BEADS (4 specimens; Fig. 18, h-i). One polished bone bead, made from
the radius-ulna of a hawk-sized bird, is incised. Three grooves are cut around the
bone and are filled with asphaltum. A fourth groove was started (L: 35; MW: 5.5).
A similar polished bone bead was also recovered. It is not incised and was made
from the radius of a vulture (L: 35; MW: 7.5). Two smaller, thicker beads were
made from the bones of a raccoon-sized animal. These beads are not as highly
polished; one is rodent-gnawed (L: 11.5-14; MW: 11-12.5). Two other bone
specimens might represent beads but are in such poor condition that identification
is not possible.
POLISHED BONE FRAGMENTS (9 specimens). All fragments show a high
degree of polishing. Several are burned.

SHELL ARTIFACTS
NOTCHED SHELL (1 specimen; Fig. 18, j]. This Rabdotus land snail has a
rectangular slit cut in it. Clark (1969) reviews many of the archeological sites in
Texas that have yielded shell ornaments. Most recorded examples are of snails
that were strung as beads, and this modified land snail might have been utilized
in that manner (L of snail: 22.5; L of notch: 10.5).

FLAKE ANALYSIS
The total amount of flakes that came out of the excavations
conducted at Scorpion Cave was not available for analysis. From
the flakes that were studied, it appears that the final stages of
biface reduction were carried out within the cave. The majority
of flakes are interior; comparatively, very few primary or
secondary flakes were present. Many of the flakes can be
classified as bifacial thinning flakes. Only 12 cores were found
in the cave; 135 preforms and 23 crude bifaces were recovered.
Units 13, 14, 15, 17 and 19 (see Fig. 4) contained large numbers
of flakes.
Many blades were also recovered from the deposits. Blades
are representative of a specialized flint&napping technique that
produces a long, narrow flake, which even unmodified has an
excellent cutting edge. The length of a blade is at least twice the
width and exhibits one or more lateral ridges on the dorsal face.
Retouched blades and arrow points made on blades were
analyzed and described earlier in the text. According to Green
and Hester (1973) blades are characteristic of the Late
Prehistoric period. Patterson (1973, 1976) has carried out extensive studies of blade technology in Texas.

HISTORIC ARTIFACTS
The Historic period is represented by a wide variety of
artifacts. Specimens of pottery, glass, metal, leather, and plastic
were recovered from Scorpion Cave. None of these can be attributed to a historic Indian occupation of the cave. Other than
several majolica fragments, the earliest items are Americanmanufactured and can be dated to the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. Other specimens date up to the present time.
Presumably the historic items were randomly carried into the
cave by campers, hunters or other transients. Due to the
relatively small number of specimens it is doubtful that they
represent any sort of long-term historic utilization of the cave. A
State Historical Commission marker at the site of the Medina
Dam indicates that 16 Mormon families under the leadership of
Lyman Wright settled there in 1854; the site was abandoned in
1858 due to Indian depredation. Present-day owners do not know
of any other settlements or structural remains in the immediate

area that date to the late 1800s and early 1900s which might
explain the presence of the older specimens.
Other caves and rockshelters in central Texas have also
contained historic artifacts as well as a prehistoric assemblage.
Kincaid Rockshelter in Uvalde County (Glen Evans, personal communication}, Oblate Rockshelter in Comal County (Johnson, Suhm
and Tunnell 1962}, and Classen Rockshelter in Bexar County
(unpublished manuscript on file at the Center for Archaeological
Research, The University of Texas at San Antonio) contained
historic metal and glass artifacts overlying prehistoric occupational debris.
The specimens from Scorpion Cave were scattered throughout the upper levels of most excavated units. The majority of
these items extended from the outermost units of the cave to
Units 19 and 20 (see Fig. 4); fewer specimens were found in the
rear passageway.
The following is a general discussion of the historic
specimens from Scorpion Cave:
CERAMICS
MAJOLICA (Fig. 19, a, b). Four fragments of European majolica probably date
to the late 19th century (Anne Fox, personal communication). The three body
sherds and one rim sherd have a green and yellow floral design on an off-white
background. There is a green band along the exterior rim.
MEYER’S POTTERY (Fig. 19, f). Twenty-eight fragments of Meyer’s pottery,
probably from the same vessel, date to the late 1800s and early 1900s (Anne Fox,
personal communication}. Founded in 1887, the Meyer Kiln was located in
Atascosa near San Antonio. It continued in operation until 1937. Meyer’s pottery
is distinguished by a red slip which results in mottled golds, browns, and greens
(Schuetz 1969}.
CRUCIBLE {Fig. 19, g). This fired clay fragment probably represents the lining
of a still (Anne Fox, personal communication}. The owners of the property report
that they have located the remains of a still near the cave.
MARBLE. This fired clay specimen was found in the rear of the cave.

GLASS
BOTTLE GLASS. 189 fragments of aqua, clear, amber, and green bottle glass
were found scattered throughout the upper levels of the cave deposits.
"GEBHARDT EAGLE" was imprinted on one of the clear bottle glass fragments.
GLASS STOPPER. One clear bottle glass stopper was recovered.

METAL
CARTRIDGE CASES (Fig. 19, d, e). Two of the cartridge cases found in
Scorpion Cave were manufactured in the latter half of the 19th century. One is a

Spencer rim-fire cartridge case which was manufactured during the Civil War
and into the early 1870s. This type cartridge case was the standard cavalry
carbine issued by the United States government after the Civil War. The other
cartridge case is tentatively identified as a .50-.55 Springfield carbine, dated to
ca. 1870 (Sam Nesmith, personal communication}. Both of these specimens were
found in Unit 7, level 3 (see Fig. 4). Other specimens include .22 caliber, .30
caliber, .32 caliber, .38 caliber, and Colt .45 caliber cartridge cases.
BRIDLE FOR A GUN LOCK (Fig. 19, c). This specimen was found in Unit 7,
level 3 along with the aforementioned Spencer and Springfield cartridge cases
and can probably be attributed to the same time period (Sam Nesmith, personal
communication}.
NAILS. Sixteen square nails and 16 round nails were found in the deposits.
The presence of the square nails is puzzling since there are no known early structures in the immediate area.
MISCELLANEOUS METAL ITEMS. Other metal specimens include a square
nut, a fishing weight, bottle caps, wire fragments, staples, and several unidentifiable metal fragments.

MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS
A triangular leather fragment with a series of holes along one side is probably part of a shoe or boot. Five plastic buttons and one cork were also recovered.

COMMENTS ON THE MOLLUSCAN REMAINS
The following is a description of molluscan remains recovered from Scorpion Cave.
RIVER MUSSEL. Several small fragments of unidentified species were found
in the excavations, as well as two almost complete shells. No modification was
noted on any of the specimens.
LAND SNAILS. Large quantities of land snails were recovered. According to
the field notes, they were found in almost every unit. Information providing exact
quantities and provenience was not available. Identification of the species and
information on habitat are based on Allen and Cheatum (1961: 291-361).

FAMILY RABDOTUS
Rabdotus sp.
Comments: Present in large quantities at Scorpion Cave, these snails are
commonly found in semi-arid south central, southwest, and west Texas. They
probably represent a food source utilized by the prehistoric occupants of the cave
(Allen and Cheatum 1961; Hester 1971). As described earlier in the text, one shell
had been modified.

FAMILY OLIACINIDAE
Euglandina texasiana
Comments: Only four of these snails were found. Their habitat is wellprotected areas with the presence of abundant moisture.

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

178

FAMILY HELICINIDAE
Helicina sp.
Comments: These snails occurred in small quantities, Their habitat is open
wooded areas and unprotected fields, Because of their small size, they obviously
do not represent a food source.

FAMILY POLYGYRIDAE
Polygyra texasiana
Comments: Very few of these snails were recovered. They occur in both
woodlands and open fields. They do not represent a food source.

DISCUSSION

Very few mussel shell fragments were found in the materials available for analysis from Scorpion Cave. Perhaps they
were not collected by the excavators. With the close proximity of
the Medina River, it would be expected that this food source
might have been heavily exploited.
It is generally assumed that the Rabdotus species was
collected as a food item. Clark (1969, 1973) has reviewed the
data published by many archeologists in Texas and the general
opinion is that the snails were part of the aboriginal diet. Ethnohistoric accounts tend to support this assumption (T. N. Campbell, personal communication to T.R. Hester) and analysis of
human coprolites fron archeological sites is providing new
data. Bryant and Williams-Dean (1975: 107) have found the
shells of land snails in human coprolites from rockshelter sites in
Texas.
Land snails recovered from the St. Mary’s Hall site (41 BX
229) were analyzed by Guntharp (1978, unpublished manuscript,
on file at the Center for Archaeological Research, the University
of Texas at San Antonio). To determine a possible correlation between the presence of land snails and human occupation, a
study was made of distribution, density, and size of the Rabdotus
species for a selected sample from the site. The data suggests
that the Rabdotus were of such large size and found in such
large concentrations that natural distribution seems improbable.
Immature snails were noticeably absent from the site. Guntharp
concludes that the Rabdotus species had been seasonally
gathered by the prehistoric occupants of the site.
Studies have also shown that certain snails may be attracted to midden debris. Some species of land snails are often

SCORPION CAVE ARCHEOLOGY

179

found today around debris where there is abundant moisture;
Rabdotus species have been found to accumulate near dryer
deposits of organic material (Clark 1969). However, present
research seems to support the assumption that large concentrations of land snails are directly related to the gathering activities
of prehistoric peoples.
FAUNAL ANALYSIS
The faunal remains from Scorpion Cave were numerous and
widely varied. A total of 8718 bone fragments was submitted to
Billy Davidson for analysis; 285 fragments (3%) were identified
according to species and genus. The faunal remains were
analyzed according to unit and level; this data is on file at the
Center for Archaeological Research, The University of Texas at
San Antonio. The following is a taxonomically arranged list of

Several armadillo fragments were among the faunal
remains, but according to Billy Davidson the preservation of the
bone indicates the animals have only recently died and this
species should not be included in the faunal list. A recent invader from Mexico, the armadillo did not occur in south central
Texas prior to the 1900s.
The faunal remains suggest that the prehistoric inhabitants
of Scorpion Cave relied on hunting wild game and small mammals and supplemented their diet with avifauna, reptiles, and
riverine resources. According to Newcomb (1973) prehistoric
hunters and gatherers in this area of Texas overlooked very few
animals as a potential food source. Many hypotheses could be
offered regarding aboriginal hunting activities as suggested by
the faunal remains. However, many of the bone fragments might
represent recent intrusions. The majority of fragments occur in
levels 1 and 2. A great quantity of bone found in the rear of the
cave might indicate the presence of a carnivore lair. Most of
these fragments are of large mammals and turtles, snakes, and

SCORPION CAVE ARCHEOLOGY

181

turkey. A large concentration of bone was also found in the first
three levels of the units near the mouth of the cave.
Whitetail deer and cottontail rabbit were the most
numerous of the identified species. Fragments were found in
almost every excavated unit. Deer remains extended as deep as
level 8 in Unit 3 (see Fig. 4) but were mainly concentrated in
levels 1 through 3 of most units. Cottontail rabbit was encountered as deep as level 5 in Unit 20, but was concentrated in
levels 1 and 2 of most units.
Pack rat remains were also numerous. Though found in most
units, a great number of pack rat remains were found towards
the rear of the cave. The field notes do not mention the presence
of pack rat nests; however, the great quantity of fragmented
bone in the rear of the cave might conceivably be attributable to
pack rat activities.
The bovid remains could not be specifically identified as
either cow or bison, but several specimens found in the lower
levels are undoubtedly bison. According to ethnographic accounts, bison-hunting was common in this area of central Texas
(Dillehay 1974; Campbell 1975).
The occurrence of black bear is notable. According to Davis
(1974) the species was once widespread throughout the state.
However, the only other reported occurrences in the south Texas
faunal record are at the Kirchmeyer site in Nueces County
(Hester 1975c) and at Mission San Bernardo near Guerrero,
Coahuila, Mexico (Davidson and Valdez 1976). According to
Olsen (1971} bears were occasionally killed for purposes other
than food since they were competitors for both food and shelter,
especially caves.
The smaller mammals found in the deposits probably
represent food items. However, the occurrence of bat probably
indicates a recent intrusion. Caves and rockshelters are used as
roosting sites, and according to Olsen (1971), there is no
evidence that bats were ever used as a food item in this hemisphere. Because of burrowing activities, the presence of pocket
gopher in lower levels probably represents natural intrusions.
Four species of turtle, three of which are aquatic, were
identified and are considered part of the aboriginal diet. Turtle
remains were found in almost all units. Other riverine resources
include freshwater drum and yellow catfish.
Birds, especially turkey, were apparently an abundant and

182

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

preferred source of food. Turkey fragments were found in most
areas of the cave and occurred as deep as level 7 in Unit 2. The
presence of two migratory water fowl, Canada goose and greenwing teal, suggests seasonal occupation of the cave. According
to Baird (1974), Pettingill (1970), and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission (personal communication), these birds usually
occur in the southern regions of the United States from November to April. Only two fragments were identified as Canada
goose and one of these was found in association with domestic
goat and pig. This might indicate a more recent occurrence of
the fowl.
The variety of fauna suggests that the prehistoric
inhabitants of Scorpion Cave exploited a wide variety of animals
available as food. Wild game and smaller mammals, as well as
birds, reptiles, and fish were apparently abundant in the area.
The large quantity of fragmented bone might be due to the
aboriginal practice of eating bone marrow. The abundance of
such a great variety of animals, coupled with the available
vegetal resources, would have made Scorpion Cave and the
surrounding area a favored camping site for prehistoric hunters
and gatherers.

OTHER SITES
The Medina River is an area from which no previous archeological work has been published. However, it appears to be
an area that was extensively occupied for many thousands of
years. Approximately 300 yards to the north of the cave at 41
ME 8, a portion of the bank bordering the river has been washed
out during periods of heavy flooding, exposing burned rock to a
depth of approximately three feet in the upper portion of the
bank. From the lower portion of this burned rock, a Plainyiew
point was recovered (Harvey Smith, Jr., personal communication}. Below the Medina Dam is the original channel to the east,
with a creek merging from the west. Between the confluence of
these bodies of water is a strip of land from which large numbers of artifacts of Archaic and Late Prehistoric age have been
obtained, lust below the dam, Perry Haass (personal communication} reports a site at which an obsidian point has been found.
To the south of the cave, along the base of the cliff, are
several overhangs of various sizes, but no archeological
materials have been found in these areas. About 300 yards south

SCORPION CAVE ARCHEOLOGY

183

of the site is another burned rock midden from which many
Archaic and Late Prehistoric materials have been obtained,
among these a corner-tang knife. Many crude bifaces were also
recovered. Artifacts from this midden as well as many from a
five-mile stretch of the Medina River floodplain are among those
found on the surface over a period of several years by George
and Ruth Judson.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
During June and July of 1971 archeological investigations
were conducted at Scorpion Cave in northwestern Medina
County, Texas. Prehistoric occupations from the Pre-Archaic
through the Late Prehistoric periods are represented by extensive cultural remains. Historic materials were also recovered.
Suhm (1960) has been used as the main reference to incorporate
Scorpion Cave into the known archeology of central Texas and
should be consulted for further information on other cave and
rockshelter sites.
The determination of occupational sequences at Scorpion
Cave was necessarily based on temporally diagnostic artifacts
(i.e., arrow and dart points) which could be related via crossdating to similar artifacts at other central Texas sites. A careful
record of artifact provenience kept by the excavators revealed
that archeological deposits within the cave were heavily mixed
(see Table 3). This does not seem untenable given the powdery
composition of the cave deposits which could have been easily
displaced by successive groups of inhabitants.
The Pre-Archaic is represented by two Martindale points.
Early Archaic specimens include Bulverde, Early Triangular,
Nolan, Travis and Wells points. Castroville, Langtry, Marcos,
Marshall, and Pedernales points are representative of the Middle
Archaic, with Pedernales apparently continuing into the Late
Archaic at Scorpion Cave (cf. Hester 1971). Occupational
evidence of the Late Archaic is dominated by Ensor points (30%
of recovered dart points); Frio, Kinney, Montell, and Palmillas
points are also representative of the Late Archaic.
The Late Prehistoric periods is dominated by the presence
of 88 Edwards points (75% of recovered arrow points). They
represent the earliest arrow point form found in central Texas,
and this is one of the largest collections of Edwards points yet
documented. Radiocarbon dates from the La Jita site in north-

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

184

western Uvalde County (Hester 1971) indicate that this type
appeared between A.D. 900 and 1000 in the southwestern Edwards Plateau region. A radiocarbon date of A.D. 1054 was
obtained from excavations in the Camp Bullis area near San
Antonio (Gerstle, Kelly, and Assad 1978). Other arrow points
include those of the Cuney, Fresno, Perdiz, and Scallorn
varieties. Provenience of arrow point specimens (see Table 3)
shows Edwards as the only arrow point type present below level
4. However, the majority of the specimens were in levels 1 and
2, as were several Early Archaic specimens.
The beveled knife fragment and bone artifacts also date to
the Late Prehistoric period. No pottery was recovered. However,
26 nodules of clay were recovered from level 3 of Unit 36 (see
Fig. 4). Ranging in size from 1A" to 11A" in diameter, most of the
nodules were of fine yellow clay; others were of red clay which
was slightly coarser and harder. Since the nodules are fairly
uniform in size and occur in an isolated part of the cave, they
probably do not represent a natural occurrence.
Historic specimens include ceramic, glass, metal, leather,
and plastic items. Several date to the late 18th and early 19th
centuries; others date up to the present time. These items were
probably left behind by hunters or campers and do not represent
a long-term historic utilization of the cave.
Based on the percentage of projectile points, the Late
Prehistoric, with representative arrow points comprising 62% of
the total, would appear to be the heaviest occupational period at
Scorpion Cave. However, if preforms are taken into consideration, dart point preforms representative of the Archaic
period comprise 77% of the preform total (see Table 2). Since
the preforms are not temporally diagnostic and provenience of
all specimens is mixed, the occupational periods represented by
them cannot be assigned more definitely than as "Archaic". A
reasonable assumption based on consideration of both diagnostic
points and preforms would be that the cave provided intermittent shelter to numerous inhabitants from the Middle
Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods.

Lithic debris representative of the initial stages of artifact
manufacturing is not well represented at Scorpion Cave. Only 12
cores and 23 crude bifaces were recovered from the cave; primary
and secondary flakes were infrequent. Interior flakes, many classifiable as bifacial thinning flakes, comprised the greatest quantity
of lithic debris. Horizontally, recovery of several thousand flakes
and flake fragments from Units 13, 14, 15, 17 and 19 (see Fig. 4) is
indicative of an area where final flint&napping stages and/or point
resharpening were carried out. Quarry sites such as the one
recorded by Patterson (1975} in northern Medina County were
probably utilized by the cave’s inhabitants for early phases of core
reduction and initial phases of biface manufacture.
Of 134 dart point preforms recovered during excavation, 82 of
these (61%) were proximal, medial, and distal fragments. Within
the arrow point preform category, 75% are basal fragments.
Apparently the cave’s inhabitants were attempting, at times unsuccessfully, the latter stages of biface reduction within the cave.
Only two hammerstones were recovered from cave deposits; one
broken deer ulna flaking tool was also recovered.
Of special interest are the painted pebbles and stained stones.
The pebbles all have black linear decoration; one specimen also
has red patches on one face. These specimens are very rare for
this part of Texas, although a painted pebble with red linear
decoration has been reported from Zavala County (Hester 1977).
The stained stones, possibly used for grinding pigment, have
reddish colorations. A hematite concretion, not native to the immediate area, may be the color source.
Charcoal and burned limestone were found scattered throughout the deposits. According to the field notes, Units 9-12 (see Fig. 4)
contained hearths. One hearth contained a large concentration of
Rabdotus snails. At 36 inches in Units 2 and 4 a large hearth was
exposed and was surrounded by tools and chert debitage, probably
an indication of heat treatment of raw materials as part of the
knapping procedure.
Faunal remains, along with the analysis of cultural remains,
indicate that the prehistoric inhabitants of Scorpion Cave were
seasonal hunters and gatherers who utilized a wide variety of
resources found in the local environment. Whitetail deer and cottontail rabbit were most numerous in the faunal materials; a
variety of smaller mammals were also apparently utilized as
food items. The presence of bison and black bear is significant.

186

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

According to Campbell (1975), bison-hunting was common along
the Medina River. Black bear has been recorded at only two
other sites in south Texas. Turtle and turkey were a preferred
food source. Seasonality is suggested by the occurrence of
Canada goose and green-wing teal, present in the area only
during winter migrations. Riverine resources were exploited as
indicated by the presence of several species of fish and mussel
shell fragments. Found throughout the deposits were great
quantities of land snails. Mostly of the Rabdotus species, they
represent a significant food source.
Plant remains have not been preserved, but a great variety
of edible plants are available in the wooded area surrounding
the site. The recovery of several manos and pitted stones certainly suggests the processing of vegetal materials. Newcomb
(1973) provides a general description of the subsistence and
material culture of the aboriginal inhabitants of this area. He
reports that the grinding process was used for almost every
edible item, including dried fish, agave, peyote, and prickly pear.
Though most creatures were considerd as a possible food
source, plants were the mainstay of their diet (ibid). Campbell
(1975) has reviewed ethnohistoric accounts of the Payaya Indians who inhabited this region of south central Texas. A very
important part of their gathering activities was the harvesting of
pecans in autumn. The Payaya reportedly were able to remove
the nut shell without breaking the nut meats (ibid). Perhaps this
was the function of the pitted stones found within the cave. They
have been described as "nutting" stones at other archeological
sites (Johnson, Suhm, and Tunnell 1962).
The occurrence of bone beads and tools provides further
insights into the culture of the prehistoric inhabitants of Scorpion Cave. The incised bone bead, its grooves filled with
asphaltum, is probably indicative of trade with coastal peoples.
At the Floyd Morris site in Cameron County, several bone beads
with traces of asphaltum were recovered (Collins, Hester and
Weir 1969).
Comparison of Scorpion Cave to similar sites is difficult
because so little professional archeology has thus far been done
in the southwestern Edwards Plateau. Both rockshelters and
burned rock middens are frequently reported by area residents
and ranchers, but detailed information is unavailable. The
following is a review of several recorded sites in central Texas

whose artifact assemblages are comparable to specimens from
Scorpion Cave.
La ]ita, a terrace site with several burned rock middens is
located on the Sabinal River in northwestern Uvalde County (approximately 35 miles west of Scorpion Cave). It is an important
comparative source for the Edwards Plateau area (Hester 1971).
Cultural remains at La Jita are attributable to Archaic and Late
Prehistoric occupation. The Middle Archaic is dominated by the
presence of numerous Pedernales points. Nineteen Edwards
points were recovered. Bone-tempered potsherds were also
present.
Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County has an artifact assemblage similar to that of Scorpion Cave (Fox and Fox,
unpublished manuscript, Center for Archaeological Research,
The University of Texas at San Antonio). Located on Cibolo
Creek, the rockshelter contained ceramic, metal, and glass artifacts overlying prehistoric assemblages. The prehistoric
cultural remains include Castroville, Ensor, Darl, Langtry,
Montell, Pedernales, and Shumla points. A possible Edwards
point was also recovered. Other artifacts include a deer ulna
awl and a painted limestone pebble. The pebble was painted on
one end; the design motif could not be determined.
Timmeron Rockshelter in Hays County was excavated in
1975 by the Southern Texas Archaeological Association (manuscript in progress). Several dart point types were recovered, but
the Late Prehistoric components, with Edwards, Scallorn, and
Perdiz arrow points, were most numerous. Several burned rock
middens were located in the immediate vicinity of the rockshelter.
The Wolf Site in Blanco County consists of a rockshelter and
a nearby burned rock midden [Highley and Lengefeld 1977).
Several ring middens have also been recorded just west of the
site (Carolyn Spock, personal communication). Preliminary
testing at the rockshelter, located on the Pedernales River, has
resulted in the recovery of several Perdiz points, many flakes
and blades, and one bone tool. Several ovate unifacial scrapers
were surface-collected near the rockshelter; these specimens can
be attributed to the Late Prehistoric period (Green and Hester
1973).
Salvage archeological efforts prior to construction of
Canyon Reservoir in Comal County (Johnson, Suhm and Tunnell

188

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

1962) revealed three important sites, a burned rock midden site,
a terrace site, and a rockshelter. Oblate Rockshelter contained
remains of the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, with Ensor,
Frio, Marcos, Perdiz, and Scallorn points present in large
numbers.
As with most caves and rockshelters, the Late Prehistoric
cultural assemblage at Scorpion Cave is more prolific than the
Archaic components. A gradual increase in occupational debris
begins in the Middle Archaic period. The presence of a nearby
burned rock midden also seems to be characteristic of most cave
and rockshelter sites. Burned rock middens are attributable to
the Archaic period. Their occurrence near a natural shelter
suggests multi-component utilization of the general area surrounding the site. The Late Prehistoric, represented by a greater
number of diagnostic artifacts, might indicate longer periods of
occupation of natural shelters and/or utilization by larger groups
of peoples. Further research is needed to incorporate the data
from central Texas rockshelters and determine their relevance
in overall settlement patterns of prehistoric hunters and
gatherers.
