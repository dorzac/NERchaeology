From Circleville to Toyah:
Comments on Central Texas Chronology
Elton R. Prewitt

ABSTRACT
Relatively reliable radiocarbon assays tor the Central Texas region now total at least
147. These assays, when dendrochronologically corrected, support the sequence of temporal phases proposed by Prewitt (1981). The assays are tabulated and the age ranges are
illustrated. Minor adjustments to the beginning and ending dates of some phases are made
to reflect additional radiocarbon dates obtained since 1981. The refined chronology provides a departure point for estimating relative population density through time. Frequency
of component occurrence is tabulated for 147 sites or surveys reported in Central Texas.
These frequencies are then divided by the length of the phases (in years) to obtain a density ratio. Contrary to previous subjective estimates, this method indicates a decrease in
population density in the middle Archaic and a peak in the late Archaic. This is followed
by a sharp decrease in the Neoarchaic Austin phase and a slight increase in the Toyah
phase. Additional discussions are concerned with overlapping ranges of dates between
phases. The Neoarchaic Austin and Toyah phases provide an example to show that each of
these phases occurs earlier in the northern portions of Central Texas. When compared to
the historical incursions of the Apaches, and later the Comanches, a pattern of population
translocations is evident. This suggests that a series of southward movements out of the
Plains began at least a thousand years before the arrival of the Apaches.

INTRODUCTION
Cultural chronology in Central Texas has received a great deal of attention
from archeologists for many years. Refinements of the basic framework continue
to be made by various individuals. This trend can be expected to continue as
additional data for the region are accumulated. Recently, I published a short synthesis detailing my perception of the Central Texas chronological sequence (Prewitt 1981). A major criticism of that article has been the omission of supporting
radiocarbon assays to accompany the age ranges given for the cultural phases.
The purpose of this paper is to provide that supporting documentation. The
chronological data are then used to construct a method for determining index
ratios that may indicate changing relative population densities within the Central
Texas archeological region. Finally, an explanation of overlapping date ranges for
the Neoarchaic stage is provided.

THE RADIOCARBON DATA

A listing of the radiocarbon assays used in this paper is given in Table 1.
This compilation of 147 assays has been screened for general contextual integrity. Dates obtained from snail shells are not included because of their demonstrated unreliability (Valastro and Davis 1970a:273). Other sample results are
omitted due to inconsistencies between the known cultural context and the reported age range. The list presented here, then, is not to be regarded as a compilation of all radiocarbon assays that have been obtained for Central Texas.
Rather, a degree of judicious screening has been exercised in the compilation.
However, it should be noted that all samples which reflect probable overlapping
of the age ranges of phases have been retained on the list. No attempt has been
made to ignore assays that do not fall neatly within the stated range of a particular phase.
Table 1 presents a variety of data for each sample. The sample number (e.g.,
Tx 508) is followed by the assay date and range stated in radiocarbon years (e.g.,
490 -+ 80) B.P. (years before present, corrected to A.O. 1950). The samples are
arranged in chronological order of the median date reported by the issuing laboratory. The laboratory date is followed by a corrected date and range derived
from Damon et al. (1974). Assays younger than 350 or older than 5700 radiocarbon years are not corrected. The next column indicates the general provenience of each sample by site name and site number. The final column gives the
source of each assay.
A plot of all the assay ranges is presented in Figure 1. More detailed plots of
the ranges are shown in Figures 2 through 4. It is readily apparent that a large
majority (107 of 147, or 73 percent) of the assays fall within the Late ArchaiC
and Neoarchaic phases. However, it is encouraging to note that of the 33 assays
obtained since the data were compiled for the 1981 article (Prewitt 1981), 20
assays are Middle Archaic or older. This, as expected, has resulted in the minor
adjustment of age ranges for several phases. This procedure can be expected to
continue as more dates are obtained. A comparison of the 1981 and the current
chronological interpretation is presented in Figure 5.

RELATIVE POPULATION DENSITIES

The relative prehistoric population density of any given region is a topic
that is difficult to approach. In no case have we totally surveyed a given area,
accurately determined approximate band size for each component of each site,
and then arrived at a maximum population figure for a given period of prehistory.
Recent population estimates have been based on unquantified perceptions rather
than on hard data. At best, these are subjective guesses that reflect individual
experiences. Two examples, Weir (1976) and Skinner (1981), are reviewed to
illustrate this point.
Weir (1976:119-137), in his synthesis of the Central Texas Archaic, includes a general indication of population density to support his assumptions regarding focal or dispersed economic orientations in the subsistence base. This is
summarized (Weir 1976:138) as low for the Early Archaic San Geronimo phase,
increased in the Clear Fork phase, high in the Middle Archaic Round Rock phase,
diminished in the San Marcos phase, and continued diminishing in the terminal
Archaic Twin Sisters phase. This reflects Weirâs personal orientation toward the
Middle Archaic. Since he dealt extensively with that period in his studies (see
Weir 1967, 1976, and 1980), his perception of site densities is subjectively (and
unconsciously) distorted to emphasize the Middle Archaic.
Skinner (1981) argues a slightly different interpretation, but it is similarly
based on subjective dealings with the Late Archaic. He envisions a more-or-less
normal distribution curve where there is a steady population increase beginning
with a low density in the Paleo-Indian stage and peaking with a high density in
the Late Archaic. Population density then decreases steadily through the Neoarchaic until the cultural truncation precipitated by European peoples. Figure 6a
illustrates the generalized population density estimates given by both Weir and
Skinner.
These two estimates provide an interesting contrast in interpretation based
on subjective information. They also provide a point of departure to more realistically discuss generalized population density estimates. While working on the
chronological synthesis of Central Texas in 1981, I blundered across a potentially
useful method of estimating population density. I did not feel that adequate data
had been compiled to effectively support my arguments at the time, so my notes
and scribbled ideas were laid aside. Work on a totally separate subject during
1983 resulted in the accumulation of the appropriate data.
While actual numbers will change as new data are published, the basic idea
was to obtain a ratio of component occurrences to the duration of a component in
years. This should eliminate the subjectivity displayed by Weir and Skinner. The
first step in deriving a density ratio index is to determine the approximate duration of each phase or time period. This has been accomplished to a certain degree
of accuracy in the first section of this paper. This information is graphically
summarized in Figure 6b. As can be seen in this illustration, the duration of
most phases varies markedly, although there is a general trend toward shorter
periods through the Late Archaic.
The second step is to determine the number of times each component occurs
in the region. This is, of course, an impossible task in view of our lack of data
about every site that exists, or has existed, in Central Texas. However, if it is
accepted that published reports represent a relatively accurate portrayal of the

relative occurrence of components, then there is a basis from which a ratio can
be obtained. The data used here are from a statewide projectile point distribution
study I am currently conducting. Over 400 reports have been examined in detail,
and the types (and frequency) of projectile points have been tabulated. Within the
Central Texas region (as defined in 1981), there are 147 reported sites with 907
component occurrences represented (Table 2). These figures cannot be taken as
gospel for several reasons. Variations in the regional boundary through time have
not been taken into consideration. Only those sites that fall within the generalized boundary are included. In addition, all sites included do not necessarily
represent single sites. Surveys are treated as single site occurrences. However, in
some areas, multiple surveys have been reported. Each of these is treated as a
separate site occurrence. Some excavation reports lump artifacts from more than
one site. Where possible, these have been segregated, but in many instances it
has been impossible to effectively sort the materials on the basis of the published
information. In those cases, two or more sites may be treated as a single site
occurrence.
With these caveats in mind, the frequency of component occurrences is
illustrated in Figure 6c. There is a general tendency for the percentage of components to increase through the Late Archaic, then decrease in the terminal Archaic. This is roughly similar to Skinnerâs postulations (see Figure 6a). As will be
seen, though, this is an inaccurate representation.
The third step in deriving general population density is to obtain a ratio of
component occurrences to time. This is accomplished by dividing the number of
component occurrences by the length of that specific phase in calendar years.
Figure 6d, which presents the results of these calculations, suggests that general
population densities varied markedly through time. The overall trend is for
steady population increase through the Archaic followed by a sharp decrease in
the Neoarchaic.
A very low ratio is obtained for the Paleo-Indian stage. This is followed by
relatively even increases in the Circleville and San Geronimo phases of the Early
Archaic. However, there is a distinct decrease in the Jarrell phase followed by an
increase in the Oakalla phase and a sharp increase in the Clear Fork phase. Surprisingly, and in contrast to Weirâs perception, there is another distinct decrease
in the Marshall Ford phase followed by further decrease in the Round Rock
phase. This trend is abruptly reversed with a sharp increase in the San Marcos
phase that levels off through the Uvalde phase. The Twin Sisters phase sees
another sharp increase followed by a very marked increase that peaks in the
Driftwood phase. The ratio then drops abruptly in the Austin phase of the
Neoarchaic. In fact, it falls to Middle Archaic levels. The succeeding Toyah
phase shows the beginnings of another increase that is truncated by European
influences.
These ratios must be used with caution, as they indicate only relative population densities, not actual numbers. It must be kept in mind that we are dealing
with component occurrences, not head counts. At this point, our knowledge of
the prehistory of Central Texas does not allow us to calculate the frequency of
group moves from one site to another. Nor are there substantive data available to
indicate the degree of fluctuation in the frequency of movement between phases.
Consequently, groups in one phase that may have moved fewer times will be
represented by a lower ratio than groups in another phase that may have moved
more frequently but had a smaller actual population.

For example, the florescence of burned rock midden use in the Middle
Archaic phases may have precipitated a relatively high degree of sedentism.
Fewer sites would have been occupied by any one group, and group size could
have been relatively large. In contrast, the dispersed foraging and hunting economy of the Late Archaic phases may have forced smaller group sizes, but these
groups could have moved from one site to another more frequently. These situations would yield the kind of ratios illustrated in Figure 6d but would not yield an
accurate estimate of actual population.
However, with these cautions in mind, the data presented in this paper provide quantified indications of relative population density. While it may be argued
that at this point I have shown only site density rather than people density, there
is still some merit to the method in that it avoids unsupported generalizations
such as those made by Weir and Skinner. It provides at least a rudimentary mechanism for comparing ratios of densities between temporal phases even though it is
certain that better and more accurate methods will be devised in the future.
That a more accurate system will be devised is not idle speculation in view
of the increasing attention that is directed toward estimates of generalized population density. For example, Collins and Driskell (1980) have presented a case for
a population peak in the Late Archaic in the Falls of the Ohio River region in
Indiana and Kentucky. While they relied on a simple frequency of component
occurrence to make their case, the idea of examining the data to make such determinations indicates that thought is increasingly being directed toward this problem. Other researchers within the Central Texas region are similarly concerned.
In particular, Carlson and others (1983) present a scenario at Fort Hood that is
consistent with the data presented in this paper. At Fort Hood, component frequency was calculated on the basis of number of occurrences per 1,000 years.
That they used a grosser chronology (Early, Middle, and Late Archaic) does not
detract from the effectiveness of their presentation. Their results are quite compatible with those described here using a more refined chronology. Since Fort
Hood is wholly contained within Central Texas, this provides support for the current data.
A dual system relying on both component frequency and projectile point
frequency is utilized by Howard (Howard and Freeman 1984). Again, the results
are remarkably similar to those described in this paper. Their project involved a
survey of about 1,800 acres in northwestern Travis County, so the compatible
results are not surprising. I suspect that Howard has identified an additional item
to be examined: projectile point tYequency in relation to component occurrence.
I must temper my enthusiasm for this angle of investigation by pointing out
that projectile point frequency alone is insufficient to solve the problem. As I
have discussed previously (Prewitt 1981, 1982), the dependency upon hunting
plays an important role in the frequency of projectile points, and this must be
determined by the relationships of all tools within a given phase. Still, there is a
definite merit to the system Howard has proposed.
However, there is another dimension that needs to be added to the complex
formula under development. This concerns the geographic area encompassed by
any given phase. As indicated in Prewitt (1981), some phases encompass nmch
smaller areas than others. This must be taken into consideration when dealing
with relative population density. I predict that we will have a substantially more
accurate idea of population density when we derive an analytical system based
upon the relationships of the following elements: (1) length of phase in years; (2)

Prewitt--Circleville to Toyah

225

frequency of component occurrence; (3) frequency of projectile point occurrence; (4) ratio of projectile points to all other tools for a given phase; and (5)
area encompassed by each phase. Obviously, this problem will require considerable work to arrive at any reasonable solution. Certainly, the simplified system
illustrated in this paper is an improvement, but there are more improvements to
come. Once the five elements noted above are combined into one mathematical
formula, then we may expect to have a more realistic, although not complete,
grasp upon relative population densities in the Central Texas region.
OVERLAPPING PHASES
A recurrent problem with the manner in which ages of phases are presented
in this paper is the overlapping of.temporal ranges. I prefer to use a median date
to indicate the end of one phase and the beginning of the next. This is not a completely accurate portrayal of the realities involved in the passage of time. As is
obvious in Figure 1, there are several instances where the date ranges for successive phases overlap to some degree. This is particularly true in the Late Archaic and Neoarchaic phases, t will focus on the Neoarchaic to explain my interpretation of this phenomenon.
Phases are not static units designed for pigeonholing relics of the past.
Phases are descriptive tools used to characterize fluid human activities in specific
geographic areas. In this instance, phases are used to characterize a very large
area termed the Central Texas archeological region. Cultural adaptations or expressions cannot be expected to appear suddenly at the same time over the entire
region. Rather, a specific phase must originate, or enter a region, from some
limited area, then spread across the remainder.
If the Neoarchaic phases are viewed in this manner, then the overlap between the ending of the Austin phase and the beginning of the Toyah phase is
clarified. To do this, the succession of phases must be viewed on a north-south
distributional basis along the Balcones fault zone. This is necessary because
most of our radiocarbon dates are from sites along this zone; we do not have
sufficient data for an east-west comparison, nor can we extend the comparison
into the Archaic for the same reason.
Figure 7 presents a graph of the Austin and Toyah phase radiocarbon dates
segregated on a north-south basis. It is clear from this illustration that the Austin
phase appeared somewhere around 1350 B.P. in the northern area that extends
from about Cleburne to Waco. In the middle area that extends from just south of
Waco to about Round Rock, the beginning dates are around 1250 B.P. The Austin phase begins in the southern area (extending from about Austin to San Antonio) at about 1 t00 B.P. Figure 8a illustrates this progression from a geographic
perspective. The ending dates show an analogous pattern. The Austin phase ends
at about 800 B.P. in the northern area, 700 B.P. in the middle area, and 550 ~.P.
in the southern area.
Now, compare these with the beginning dates of the Toyah phase (Figure 7).
The Toyah phase appears at about 700 B.P. in the northern area, at about 600 B.P.
in the middle area, and at about 500 B.P.in the southern area (Figure 8b). The
ending dates are again analogous: 350 B.P. in the northern area, 250 a.P. in the
middle area, and 200 B.P. in the southern area.
The overlap period of about 700 to 550 B.P. is illustrated in Figure 8c. While

the Austin phase still exists in the southern area, the Toyah phase has already
begun in the northern area. Thus, the overlapping date ranges are not only plausible but are expectable if this model is accepted. Further, there are far-reaching
implications to be derived from the model.
It is an accepted fact that major north to south population movements occurred during the early Historic stage. The Apache expansion that swept southward and westward in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is well documented. This event was followed by a similar movement by the Comanches in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. These historical events are generally attributed to the effects generated by contact with European peoples. Acquisition
of guns and horses is credited for giving these groups the military superiority and
mobility necessary for rapid expansion and movement.
However, if the model presented here for the Austin and Toyah phases is accurate, then this pattern was established at least a thousand years before the Apaches
began their rise to southern Plains domination. What triggered these postulated
prehistoric population or cultural expansions? It is possible that the Austin phase
could have resulted from the early adoption of the bow and arrow by groups that
gained technological superiority over more conservative groups that maintained
a dependency on the atlatl and dart weapons systems. Did this result in a movement of people or just ideas? Was the change violent, or was there peaceful interchange through trade? Certainly there are increased suggestions of violence
during the Austin phase (Prewitt 1974:46-50, 1982:66, 176-178). Could this reflect an event similar to the later Apachean incursions? The possibilities are
there,but I do not think we have sufficient data to answer these questions at the
present time.
What about the Toyah phase? What triggered this change? Did another group
actually move out of the Plains and into the Central Texas region? The primary
changes seem to have been precipitated by the southward expansion of bison. At
least, the subsistence base appears to have been related to bison procurement.
Did a familiarity with bison-procurement methods provide one group with technological superiority over other resident groups to whom bison were previously
unknown? As with the Austin phase, we do not have sufficient data to answer
such questions now.
What is important here is that there is a logical explanation for the radiocarbon dates that have been obtained for the Neoarchaic stage in the Central
Texas region. Further, this small bit of information can provide the basis with
which to examine more detailed questions regarding people and their activities
during a specific period of time.
