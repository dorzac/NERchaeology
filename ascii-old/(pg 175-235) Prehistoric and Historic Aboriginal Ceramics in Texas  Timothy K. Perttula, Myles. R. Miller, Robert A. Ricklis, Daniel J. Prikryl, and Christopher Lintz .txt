ABSTRACT
The use of ceramics by prehistoric Native Americans was widespread in Texas, being adopted by groups
in East Texas as early as ca. 500 B.C. and then continued to be used as late as the nineteenth century among a
number of different Native American groups across the state. The variety of ceramic forms, decorations,
manufacturing technologies, and functions is impressive, ranging from: coastal Goose Creek and Rockport
pottery; the Toyah and Henrietta ceramics of the buffalo hunters of the prairie-plains; the Puebloan and Antelope
Creek ceramics of the Panhandle farmers and buffalo hunters; the impressive Jornada Mogollon ceramics of the
E1 Paso area Puebloan groups; and the well-made and finely decorated ceramics of the Caddoan groups of Eastern
Texas. This paper provides broad overviews of the different currently recognized prehistoric and historic
regional ceramic assemblages in Texas, focusing on their technological and functional character, and changes
over time in ceramic styles, types, and vessel forms.

INTRODUCTION
Much attention has been paid by Texas archeologists over the years to the stone projectile points,
tools, and lithic debris made and discarded by the
prehistoric Native Americans who lived in the state
of Texas (e.g., Turner and Hester 1993; Davis 1991;
Suhm and Jelks 1962). While not without problems
of analytical scope and clarity (sensu Johnson 1989),
the archeological focus on stone artifacts has produced a wealth of information on the manufacture
and use of stone tools, as well as a better understanding of the cultural context and chronology of
these tools--most notably the temporal sequences
of the dart and arrow projectile points in the different regions of Texas (Turner and Hester 1993:1163; see also Prewitt, this volume).
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about
the prehistoric and historic aboriginal ceramics in
Texas. Certainly, valuable information has been
gained since the 1940s and 1950s on the styles and
types of ceramics made in Texas by Native Americans (Krieger 1946; Suhm et al. 1954; Suhm and
Jelks 1962). This is especially true of the wel!made and abundant ceramic vessels recovered in
quantities from prehistoric Caddoan sites in Northeast Texas, and much of importance has been

learned of late from analyses of Coastal (Aten 1983;
Ellis 1992; Ricklis 1990), Canyonlands (Boyd et al.
1993), and Toyah phase ceramics (Johnson 1994;
Quigg and Peck 1995; Treece et al. 1993). Nevertheless, overall it is fair to say that our general level
of understanding concerning prehistoric ceramics,
and the appreciation of the kinds of useful information their study can provide about cultural affiliations, well-defined temporal frameworks, site
function, food processing and storage, and trade
and exchange between groups, is not well developed in Texas archeology today.
This paper begins to redress this relative lack
of attention given prehistoric and historic aboriginal
ceramics by Texas archeologists. We consider
regional ceramic assemblages in Texas (i.e.,
Northeast Texas [Caddoan], North Central [Plains
Village], East Central, Southeast Texas, Central and
South Texas [Toyah and Rockport], Rolling Plains
and Panhandle [Antelope Creek] and Caprock
Canyonlands, and West Texas Mountains and
Basins [Jornada Mogollon]), and focus on two main
goals: (a) to discuss the technology and functional
character of these regional ceramic assemblages
(Figure 1); and (b) to summarize the context and
temporal framework of the assemblages, with
particular attention to changes over time and space

vessel forms for each Texas region.
Caddoan Ceramics from
Northeast Texas
The distinctive styles and forms of ceramics
found on sites in Northeast Texas hint at the variety,
temporal span, and geographic extent of a number
of prehistoric Caddoan groups in this region (cf.
Thurmond 1985, 1990). The diversity in decoration

and shape in Caddoan ceramics is substantial, both
in the utility ware jars and bowls, as well as in the
fine ware bottles, carinated bowls, and compound
vessels. However, prehistoric ceramics had been
manufactured in Northeast Texas for about 1000
years before the development of the Late Prehistoric
(after ca. A.D. 800/900) Caddoan ceramic tradition.
Story (1990:246-247, 277-319), in an excellent discussion of the cultural context and archeological character of these early ceramic-making
groups, indicates that the earliest ceramics in the

region date between ca. 500-!00 B.C. and are
closely related to the kinds of ceramics being produced in the Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV).
Groups manufacturing these early ceramics were
relatively sedentary hunter-gatherers. South of the
Sabine River, the earliest locally produced ceramics are plain wares with sandy pastes (sharing similarities with the coastal and inland Southeast Texas
ceramic Goose Creek Plain), while north of the
Sabine River to the Red River, the early ceramics
are principally from thick, plain grog- (Williams
Plain) and bone-tempered (Cooper Boneware) vessels, although sandy paste wares are also present in
low numbers (Story 1990:246).
Between the introduction of ceramics in the
region, and the emergence of distinctive Caddoan
vessel forms and decorative motifs around A.D.
800, the local plain ware traditions seem to have
continued relatively unchanged. LMV-related ceramics are present as well, although not in great
numbers, including distinctive Marksville,
Troyville, and Coles Creek incised and stamped
vessels (see Phillips 1970) from sites such as Resch,
Coral Snake, Tankersley Creek, and James Pace in
the Sabine River and Cypress Creek basins.
As Story (1990:247) notes:
Sometime probably between A.D. 700 and
A.D. 900 (there is a lot of room for arguing
the age), Caddoan ceramics came to dominate
the northeastern part of [Texas]. These ceramics are distinguished by certain vessel forms
(especially a long-necked bottle with a globular body and a carinated bowl), engraved decorations, and other attributes. Although the
bottle form and engraving may have an exotic
origin, most of the Caddoan ceramics can be
recognized as local developments with strong
influences from the LMV.
A diverse and distinctive ceramic assemblage characterizes the Caddoan tradition in Northeast Texas.
Ceramics are quite common in domestic contexts
on habitation sites across the region (i.e., it is not
unusual to recover more than 10,000 sherds from
hundreds of vessels on Caddo settlements on excavation projects, and assemblages with upwards of
100,000 sherds are not uncommon at the larger
sites), and also occur as grave goods in mortuary
contexts (see for example the large well-analyzed
sherd assemblages from George C. Davis [Newell
and Krieger 1949; Stokes and Woodring 1981],

177

Deshazo [Fields 1981], Bensonâs Crossing
[Driggers 1985], and 41MX5 [Brewington et al.
1995]). Much attention has been paid by Caddoan
archeologists over the years to the well-made ceramics manufactured by the Caddo peoples, and it
is accurate, we think, to state that the study of
Caddo ceramics is integral to the study of any Caddo
site in the four-state Caddoan archeological area.
The Caddo made ceramics in a wide variety of
vessel shapes (cf. Reynolds 1992), and with an
abundance of well-crafted and executed (Johnson
1992) body and rim designs and surface treatments
(Table 1). From the archeological contexts in which
Caddo ceramics have been found, as well as inferences about their manufacture and use, it is evident
that ceramics were important to the prehistoric
Caddo in: the cooking and serving of foods and
beverages, in the storage of foodstuffs, as personal
possessions, as beautiful works of art and craftsmanship (i.e., some vessels were clearly made to
never be used in domestic contexts), and as social
identifiers (that is, certain shared and distinctive
stylistic motifs and decorative patterns marked
closely related communities and constituent groups
[David et al. 1988; Thurmond 1985]).
The Caddo made both fine wares (with very
finely crushed temper [Schambach and Miller
1984:109]), bottles and many bowls, and utility
wares (some of the simple bowls, as well as the jars
that were made in a variety of sizes). Almost without exception, Caddoan ceramics were tempered
with grog (crushed sherds) or bone, although burned
and crushed shells were used as temper after ca.
A.D. 1300 among most of the Red River Caddo
groups (see Bruseth 1995; Schambach and Miller
1984) and on later Caddoan sites in the upper Sulphur River basin (see Fields et al. 1994; Cliff and
Perttula 1995). After adding the temper to the clay,
the kneaded clay was formed into clay coils that
were added to flat disk bases to form the vessel,
and the coils were apparently smoothed with a round
river pebble to create the finished vessel form. Decorations and slips were added before, as well as
after, baking in an open fire, and commonly the
vessels were then burnished and polished; red ochre
and white kaolinite clay pigments were often added
to or painted on to the decorations on bottles and
carinated bowls.
These kinds of ceramics were designed to
serve different purposes within Caddoan communities and family groups--from that of a cooking

pot to the mortuary function of a ceremonial beaker-and this is reflected in differences in paste,
surface treatment, firing methods, decoration, and
vessel form between the two wares. Both the early
and later Caddoan fine wares were usually wellpolished, and decorated with fine-line incised and
engraved designs (Figure 2a-n, Figure 3a-p, and

Figure 4a-e, h). The earlier Caddoan fine ware
designs are curvilinear, rectilinear, and horizontal,
and frequently cover the entire vessel surface; other
fine ware designs simply are placed on the rim (see
Figure 3c, f-k, m-n), or sometimes on the interior
rim surface. In general, the earlier Caddoan fine

quite uniform in style and form, suggesting broad
and extensive social interaction between Caddoan
groups across the region.
The later Caddoan fine ware designs in
Northeast Texas include scrolls, scrolls with ticked

lines, scrolls and circles, negative ovals and circles,
pendant triangles, diagonal lines and ladders, and
S-shaped motifs (see Figure 4a-e, h; also Suhm and

use in historic Caddoan ceramics (that is, until about
A.D. 1800 [Gregory 1973]). They are best
exemplified by the intricate scrolls, ovals, and
circles on Hudson Engraved and Keno Trailed
bottles and Natchitoches Engraved bowls among
Red River Caddoan groups, the scrolls and ticks of
Patton Engraved among Hasinai Caddo groups
south of the Sabine River (Fields 1981), and the
pendant triangles and engraved scolls on Womack
Engraved bowls on the upper Sabine (Duffield and
Jelks 1961; Jelks 1967) and the middle Red River
(Harris et al. 1965).
The later Caddoan fine wares (that is, dating
after ca. A.D. 1300/1400) are more stylistically diverse across Northeast Texas, and there are very
specific differences in vessel shapes, designs, and
decorative attributes between Caddoan ceramics in

individual drainages, or even within specific smaller
segments of river and creek basins (e.g., Thurmond
1985; Perttula et al. 1993). This diversity can be
reasonably interpreted to be representative of specific Caddoan social groups. In historic Caddoan
times, ceramic vessel forms and decorations are
considerably more homogeneous across much of
the Caddoan area, suggesting extensive intra-regional contact between contemporaneous Caddoan
groups (Perttula 1992:154 and Table 14).
Table 1 indicates the impressive diversity of
vessel forms among the Caddoan fine wares. This
includes carinated bowls, deep compound bowls,
double and triple vessels (joined bowls and bottles
[Suhm and Jelks !962:Plates 38k, 51e, 59d]),
bottles, ollas, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic
effigy bowls and bottles, ladles, platters, peaked

jars, gourd and box-shaped bowls, and chalices.
The Caddoan utility vessels usually have a
coarser paste, a rougher surface treatment, and
thicker body walls than the fine wares, which was
probably related to the performance needs of the
cooking pot to withstand thermal shock and cracking during use (see the experimental studies by
Schiffer et al. 1994 on the thermal response of
cooking pots). Typical utility vessel shapes included
small to large jars (see Figure 2t, Figure 3q, and
Figure 4f-g), as well as a variety of conical and
simple bowl and bottle forms, most of the latter in
the earlier Caddoan ceramics (and the historic
Caddoan ceramics) being plain and unpolished. The
utility vessels have carbon encrustations, food residues, and soot stains, suggesting they were employed by the Caddo as cooking pots. Some of
these kinds of vessels were used primarily for storage (those with large orifice diameters and vessel
volumes) of foodstuffs and liquids.
While plain utility vessels were commonly
used by Caddoan groups in Northeast Texas, particularly before ca. A.D. 1300-1400 (see Table 1),
they were also decorated in a variety of ways. The
earlier Caddoan utility wares had horizontal (see
Figure 2o-r) and cross-hatched incised lines, fingernail impressions (see Figure 2s-t), pinching, fingernail and tool punctates on the rim and bodies, as
well as neck-banding, at least south of the Sabine
River [see Newell and Krieger 1949] (see Figure
3q). The types of decorations and/or surface treatments on later Caddoan utility vessels included
neck-banding or corrugation (see Figure 4f-g),
brushing, ridging, applique (Perino 1994:Figure 7ef, h), and combinations of zoned and diagonal incised and punctated designs on the rim and body of
jars. In historic Caddoan times, rows of fingernail
punctations on the rim of everted-rim Emory
Punctated-Incised jars are a common decorative
treatment. Handles and lugs were present on some
of the utility vessels.
Caddoan ceramics were apparently widely
traded in Texas, as they have been found in significant quantities on North Central, East Central, Central, and inland Southeast Texas archeological sites
(Story 1990:247). The earlier Caddoan ceramics
(dating before ca. A.D. 1300) were most widely
distributed in the upper Trinity and Brazos River
basins of North Central Texas (see Prikryl and
Perttula, below), and in inland Southeast Texas,
while the Late Caddoan ceramic wares appear to

have been most commonly exchanged with East
Central and Central Texas groups after A.D. 1300,
as well as with prehistoric peoples living along the
Trinity River in inland Southeast Texas (McClurkan
1968). Caddoan ceramic finewares were also traded
extensively in parts of the Midwest and Southeastern U.S., most notably after ca. A.D. 1300-1400
with Native American groups living in the Lower
Mississippi Valley of Arkansas and Louisiana (Early
1993:232-233).
Other types of ceramic artifacts manufactured
by prehistoric Caddoan groups include ceramic
earspools and disks, figurines, and a variety of pipe
forms (Jackson 1933:71). The earliest types of
Caddoan clay pipes were plain, tubular and cigarshaped forms, followed by the long-stem "Red
River" pipes (Hoffman 1967) with burnished and
polished stems and bowls; rectangular platform
pipes and some elbow pipe forms (Bruseth and
Perttula 1981:Figure 5-11a-b) have also been recovered in Caddoan sites dating before A.D. 1200.
The later Caddoan pipe forms in Northeast Texas
are biconical and elbow pipe forms with small bowls
(< 25 mm) and small stem diameters (< 25 mm)
(see Jackson 1933:Plates 16-18).
Two recent advances in the study of Caddoan
ceramics hold great promise for increasing our
knowledge about prehistoric stylistic, technological,
and functional changes in this material culture. First,
compositional analyses using petrographic and
chemical characterizations are now being used on
samples of Caddoan ceramics (see Fischbeck et al.
1989; Steponaitis et al. 1995) to discern
manufacturing techniques, source/regional
distributions of particular wares, and functional
characteristics of different kinds of vessels (ReeseTaylor 1994, 1995a). For example, recent analyses
of the petrographic constituents in the pastes of
Caddoan ceramic assemblages in the Sabine River,
Cypress Creek, and Sulphur River basins has shown
that there appear to be consistent paste differences
(specifically in the percentages of alkali feldspars
and quartz) between the ceramics in each of the
river and creek basins (Figure 5). This is turn seems
to reflect the local basin-specific production by
Caddoan groups of ceramic vessels from locally
available clays (Reese-Taylor 1995), with limited
evidence for the exchange of vessels from one group
to another in different basins. This type of analysis
should prove of great utility in examining the
archeological record in Northeast Texas (and

adjacent regions) for considerations of cultural
affiliation, and exchange between Caddo and nonCaddo groups, as well as for discerning
manufacturing techniques, raw material use, source/
regional distributions of particular wares, and
specific functional characteristics of different kinds
of vessels (Neff 1995; OâBrien et al. 1994).
Second, a very detailed analytical classificatory system of decorative motifs and patterns has
been developed for Caddoan ceramics by
Schambach (Schambach 1981; Schambach et al.
n.d.) that has proved useful in detecting fine-scale
temporal and stylistic changes (on the order of 2030 years) in ceramic decoration among prehistoric
Caddoan groups on the Red and Ouachita rivers in
Arkansas and Louisiana (e.g., Schambach and
Miller 1984; Kelley 1994). The system uses a hierarchical or paradigmatic (see Dunnell 1986) classification of decorative techniques and motifs (classes
A-H, such as diagonal or vertical rectilinear incised
[A], horizontal rectilinear and curvilinear designs
[B], brushed [D], engraved [E], and applique [HI,
etc.) for rims and vessel bodies in combination with
groups of similar designs within classes, called patterns. Figure 6 illustrates how the classification
works with a sample of vessels from the Late

Caddoan Cedar Grove site in southwestern Arkansas (Schambach and Miller 1984); for example, the
Austin-Abraham vessels on the top row illustrate
Class A rim and body decorations, while Austin 1
and Austin 2 represent different designs with the
Austin pattern of vertical incising on short rims.
The definition of such stylistic attributes is
well-suited to the recognition of comparable design, vessel, and rim sets across the Caddoan area.
With this kind of specific and idiosyncratic information on prehistoric vessel decorations (element
as well as placement), and forms, as well as the
character of stylistic variation present at different
times among related groups (e.g., Neiman 1995),
we can confidently explore the nature of social
relationships among Caddo groups "from the message and meaning ascribed to ceramic design"
(Early 1995:4).

Southeast Texas

Prehistoric ceramics are common in inland and
coastal sites throughout Southeast Texas (cf. Aten
1983; Bollich 1995). According to Aten (1983),
ceramics were adopted by coastal hunter-gatherers
about 2000 years B.P., and perhaps by 1500 years

ago in the Conroe-Livingston inland area; ceramics
continued to be an important part of the material
culture assemblage of these groups unti! at least
A.D. 1700. Story (1990:256 and Figure 39) includes these coastal and inland groups under the
rubric "Mossy Grove" as "a general cultural pattern
and as a regional tradition that partly parallels development of the Caddoan tradition to the north.
And, like the Caddoan tradition/culture, it encompasses the archeological remains of what were
surely different ethnic (and possibly even linguistic) groups."
Recently compiled computer data bases for
the region indicate that ceramics have been recovered in quantity from several hundred published

185

surface-collected and excavated sites (Patterson
1993, n.d.). By far the dominant kind of ceramics
in Southeast Texas is Goose Creek Plain (Aten
1983:231-232), an undecorated sandy paste ware
that was manufactured across the region (Table 2).
This ceramic occurs as relatively simple and small
to medium sized jars, beakers, and bowls (Figure 7)
with rounded bases and relatively straight (vertical)
walls (Ellis 1994; Ricklis 1994; Weinstein 1991).
Aten (1983:206-245) has developed a useful
ceramic typological system for prehistoric and early
historic Southeast Texas ceramics, basing his
approach on the type-variety system propounded by
Phillips (1970) for the LMV. Ceramic pastes (i.e.,
untempered sandy paste, sand-tempered, bone-

tempered, and grog-tempered) are the key to the
typological classification of Southeast Texas
ceramics, since most of the vessels were apparently
undecorated, but he also used decorative attributes
(such as incising, stamping, red filming, etc.) to
define specific varieties (Figure 8), including Goose
Creek Incised, Goose Creek Red-Filmed, and others.
From this classificatory scheme, Aten
(1983:Figure 14.1-14.3) has created a detailed ceramic seriation that charts temporal changes in
pastes and vessel decorations. This ceramic seriation
has recently been shown not to work that well for
estimating the chronological placement of specific
ceramic assemblages (Ellis and Ellis 1994; Ricklis
1994:213-215), probably in large measure because
it is based on small sherd sample sizes, the limited
stylistic variability in Southeast Texas ceramics,
and slow rates of change in the use of different
types of paste (which is probably tracking basic
technological continuities in the manufacture and
use of ceramics in the region). Nevertheless, it still
has merit as a chronological tool (particularly in
the absence of independently derived absolute
dates), and is currently the best available synthesis
of Southeast Texas ceramic change.

variety Conway) between about A.D. 250-425 (Aten
1983:287). Goose Creek Incised and Goose Creek
Red-Filmed, although present earlier, became more
common (perhaps combining for as much as 10
percent of particular site ceramic samples) between
ca. A.D. 650-1000, after which Goose Creek ceramics are virtually replaced by plain and decorated grog-tempered wares.
Aten (1983) has defined these grog-tempered
wares as Baytown Plain and San Jacinto Incised,
and suggests they are most frequent in sites dating
between A.D. 1000-1400+, after which they rapidly declined in popularity. More recently,
Weinstein (1991:106) has proposed that Baytown
Plain along the Upper Texas Coast be restricted to
vessels having obvious and abundant grog temper
in a clayey or silty paste matrix, as it is in the LMV

classification, and that a San Jacinto Plain type be
used for sandy paste sherds with only small amounts
of finely-crushed grog. Weinstein (1991) further
suggests that the Baytown Plain wares are not common in Southeast Texas other than between ca.
A.D. 1300-1400, and that the clearly locally produced Goose Creek and San Jacinto jars and bowls
dominate the ceramic assemblages up to about A.D.
1700. Analyses of vessel forms made during this
period of grog-tempered ceramics (Figure 9) indicate that they were predominately straight-walled
jars and wide-mouth bowls (Ellis 1994; Howard
1990; Ricklis 1994; Weinstein 1991).

Figure 9. Galveston Bay Late Prehistoric Vessel Shapes
from the Mitchell Ridge site (from Ricklis 1994:Figure
7.6).

Incised ceramics of several different styles and
decorative motifs (Aten 1983:Figure 12.6) are particularly characteristic of the period between ca.
A.D. 1000-1700 in both San Jacinto and Goose
Creek ceramics. These include in approximate sequential order as follows: zoned incised-punctated
designs, multiple horizontal incised lines, and diagonals, cross-hatching, engraved panels, and pendant triangles (Aten 1983:242). As Aten (1983:242)
and Ricklis (1994:209) have pointed out, there are
many parallels between coasta! and inland Southeast Texas ceramic styles and decorative styles used
in contemporaneous LMV Coles Creek and
Plaquemine culture ceramics (Figure 10). Ricklis
(1994) also identifies lip incising and scalloping as

187

common decorative elements in the large (+26,000
sherds) Mitchell Ridge (41GV66) ceramic assemblage, which dates principa!ly between ca. A.D.
1300-1600. He defines these decorative elements
as Goose Creek Modified Lip and San Jacinto Plain
Modified Lip types.
The period after A.D. 1000 in Southeast Texas
is also marked by the occasional appearance of
Caddoan ceramics, including kinds of engraved,
incised, and brushed sherds being made and used
by Early and Late Caddo groups in the Neches and
Angelina River basins of Northeast Texas. Caddoan
ceramics are quite abundant in the ConroeLivingston area (Aten 1983:Figure 14.5), and Aten
(1983:295) suggests from the ceramic analysis of
four sites and three radiocarbon dates that there
were two peaks in the frequency of Caddoan ceramics in the area (ca. A.D. 1000-1350, and after
A.D. 1500).
Bone-tempered ceramics appear in some quantity in Southeast Texas after ca. A.D. 1400. As
Patterson (this volume) notes, some of the ceramics
in the western part of the region may be related to
Toyah phase Leon Plain, but elsewhere in the region its sandy paste, and occasional incised designs, clearly relate it to the Mossy Grove ceramic
tradition (e.g., Aten 1983:244). At about the same
time as the peak in bone-tempered ceramics, Goose
Creek Plain ceramics appear to replace the San
Jacinto Plain and Baytown Plain, and by A.D. 1700
it accounts for more than ca. 94 percent of the
ceramic assemblages. From then until about A.D.
1800, ceramics decline in frequency on Native
American sites in Southeast Texas, although Goose
Creek Plain continued to be manufactured and used
by these groups (Aten 1983:289).
Alabama-Coushatta ceramics are also found
after 1800 in their recently established Southeast
Texas village sites. The Carl Matthews site in Polk
County is probably the best-known AlabamaCoushatta archeological site in the region. The Alabama-Coushatta ceramics are principally sandy
paste, deep flaring, Chattahoochee Roughened, vat.
Chattahoochee jars, with roughened or brushed
bodies, and with applique and crimped fillets along
the rim (Jurney and Perttula 1995), but cazuelas
and hemipsherical bowls were also manufactured.
In most particulars, Alabama-Coushatta ceramics
are virtually identicial to the ceramics being made
by their Creek Indian relatives in Alabama after
1780.

Perttula et al. ~ Prehistoric Ceramics in Texas

East Central Texas
Sandy paste ceramics are apparently the earliest wares in the Trinity and Navasota River basins,
being adopted by ca. 50 B.C. in Woodland or Early
Ceramic period contexts (Fields 1993:119); these
ceramics are quite comparable to the Goose Creek
Plain ceramics noted in the southern part of Northeast Texas and across all of Southeast Texas. Thin
shell-tempered and kaolin paste ceramics also appear in Early Ceramic contexts at several sites in
the middle Trinity and Navasota River basins
(McGregor and Bruseth 1987; Fields 1993).
By about A.D. 800, the early plain wares were
replaced by grog, grit, and bone-tempered jars,
simple bowls, and carinated bowls with punctated
and incised decorations on vessel rims and bodies
(Bruseth 1987:Table 8- t 7). The decorative elements
are quite similar to those seen on Northeast Texas
Caddoan utility wares, and the stylistic resemblances
increase in ceramic assemblages dating after ca.
A.D. 1000 (McGregor and Bruseth 1987:184; Fields
et al. 1991).
At Richland Creek, dominant ceramic decorative styles between ca. A.D. 1000-1200 include
horizontal incised lines with zoned punctates, random punctations, and diagonal incised lines, with
incised and punctated sherds accounting for about
55 percent of the decorated sherds at Bird Point
Island (Bruseth 1987:Table 8-17); engraved sherds
represent only about 3 percent of the decorated
sherd sample. Similar ceramic styles are evident in
Late Prehistoric assemblages from a number of sites
at the Jewett Mine (Fields et al. 1991). The later
ceramics (dating after ca. A.D. 1300/1400) again
bear strong resemblances to Caddoan ceramics from
Northeast Texas, particularly from Frankston phase
Caddoan groups residing in the upper Neches and
Angelina River basins (cf. Shafer 1981; Fields
1981). Well represented are brushed, incised, engraved, neck-banded, and punctated vessels that
compare well to the Poynor Engraved, Maydelle
Incised, and Bullard Brushed types (Bruseth
1987:125-126; Fields et al. 1991:254-256).
Bruseth (1987:125-126) interprets the
Caddoan-related ceramics at Richland Creek to be
of local manufacture, but a product of "interaction
with these eastern neighbors," with the possibility
of some occupation by Caddo groups from East
Texas after ca. A.D. 1300. Fields et al. (1991:258)
conclude that the Jewett ceramics are "comparable
to Caddoan pottery from East Texas proper, and

189

there is no reason to suppose that most of the vessel
ceramics were not deposited as a result of occupations by Caddoan groups." Detailed petrographic
and chemical analyses of the pastes of Northeast
Texas Caddo and East Central Texas ceramics (e.g.,
Reese-Taylor 1995a), in conjunction with the study
of stylistic and functional attributes of both regional
assemblages, should help to resolve the cultural
and social affiliation of the Late Prehistoric ceramics from this region.
Other types of ceramic artifacts were made in
Late Prehistoric times in East Central Texas. Ceramic pipes are present, although not nearly as common as on domestic Caddo sites in Northeast Texas,
and the forms of the pipes are different from the
long-stemmed or elbow pipes most common in the
latter region (Fields et al. 1991:258 and Figures 43
and 93d; Bruseth 1987:123-124). Several small clay
beads were found at Bird Point Island in a postA.D. 1300 context (Bruseth 1987:Figure 8-4c-d).

North Central Texas
Daniel J. Prikryl and Timothy K. Perttula
Prehistoric ceramics began to be made and
used by aboriginal peoples in North Central Texas
after about A.D. 1000. Although it is possible that
some small amount of grog, grit, and bone-tempered ceramics were being used as early as ca. A.D.
750 + 100 at the Baggett Branch site (41DL149) in
the upper Trinity River basin (Peter and McGregor
1988a; see also Story 1990), ceramics, however,
become common only in archeological contexts in
the region after about A.D. 1000.
A diverse range of prehistoric ceramic wares
occur across the North Central Texas region, although with the exception of villages on the Red
River (e.g., Lorrain 1967, 1969; Martin 1994; Price
1993; Witte 1935, !936), and an occasional site on
the middle Brazos (Wright 1995), the Elm Fork
(Prikryl 1990; Ferring and Yates 1995), West Fork
(Peter and McGregor 1988b), and East Fork of the
Trinity River, in most cases ceramics are not a
particularly abundant part of the material culture of
the Late Prehistoric cultural groups in the region.
For example, of 238 Native American sites reported
by Prikryl (1990) on the Elm Fork, only 35 sites
(14 percent) have yielded aboriginal ceramics. This
rarity in ceramics is especially evident in comparison with that seen in contemporaneous Caddoan

190

Texas Archeological Society

groups in Northeast Texas, and Jornada Mogollon
Puebloan groups in West Texas, where ceramics
are by far the most abundant artifact class. This
must relate to the relatively minimal importance of
the use and function of ceramic vessel containers in
the cooking and storage of food stuffs, oils, and
seed stock in the North Central Texas region.
As we discuss below, by far the most common
kinds of ceramics found in ca. A.D. 1000-1300
archeological assemblages in North Central Texas
are plain and decorated non-shell-tempered wares
that resemble the ceramics found on Caddoan sites
(Krieger [1946], and Harris [1936, 1945] before
him, noted this characteristic of the ceramics from
North Central Texas sites) in the Neches, Sabine,
and Red River drainages in the Pineywoods and
Post Oak Savannah (see Perttula, this volume). Plain
mussel shell-tempered (also including fossil-shell
and other calcareous aplastics) pottery is also wellrepresented in the North Central Texas region, principally on Plains Village archeological sites (i.e.,
the outmoded Henrietta focus or complex) that date
after about A.D. 1250/1300. We discuss these ceramics in more detail later, but we turn first to a
consideration of the pre-A.D. 1300 ceramics manufactured, and/or traded for, by aboriginal peoples in
the prairies and savannah habitats of North Central
Texas.
Caddoan grog-, bone-, and grog/bone-tempered
decorated ceramics (incising, engraving, and
punctated elements) are notable in prehistoric archeological sites dating before ca. A.D. 1300 along
the East Fork of the Trinity River and the Blackland Prairie (i.e., Harris 1936, 1945; Krieger
1946:131; Ross 1966; Sorrow 1966; Martin and
Bruseth 1988), on the Elm Fork (Prikryl 1990), in
rock shelter and terrace sites in the middle Brazos
River basin (Jelks 1962; Stephenson 1970; Brown
et al. 1987; Story 1990; Wright 1995), and at the
Cobb-Pool site at Joe Pool Lake in the drainage
basin of the West Fork Trinity River (Peter and
McGregor 1988b). Since there have been no petrographic or chemical compositional analyses of these
Caddoan ceramics to be certain of their place of
manufacture or source area, no general consensus
has been reached about whether the Caddoan ceramics represent: (a) trade wares from Caddo groups
in Northeast Texas, (b) locally-manufactured ceramic wares where vessel forms and decorative
styles may have been borrowed or copied from
nearby Caddoan communities, (c) the residues from

actual settlement of Caddoan groups in North Central Texas, or (d) some combination of the above
that may vary regionally and temporally. The occurrence of these Caddoan ceramics in the region
speaks to important issues of local and extra-local
trade and exchange between Caddoan horticulturists/agriculturists and hunter-gatherers, as well as
to perceived expansions in the broad land use patterns of the social and politically complex Caddoan
communities between ca. A.D. 1000-1300 (e.g.,
Story 1990; Perttula 1993; see also Fields, this volume); thus, ceramic sourcing studies of the North
Central Texas Caddoan ceramics will be crucial for
unravelling Late Prehistoric cultural change in the
region.
Along the middle Brazos, the small numbers
of Caddoan ceramics are represented by portions of
vessels of Hickory Engraved and Holly Engraved
from rockshelter deposits (e.g., Jelks 1962:Figure
24; Stephenson 1970:Plate 23), while sherds from
Kiam Incised, Dunkin Incised, and Weches Fingernail-Impressed vessels have been recovered in preA.D. 1300 contexts at sites such as Chupik (Story
1990), Asa Warner (Wright 1995), and McDonald
(Brown et al. 1987). These kinds of Caddoan sherds
point to associations with earlier Caddoan settlements in the Neches River basin of Northeast Texas
(e.g., Newell and Krieger 1949; Stokes and
Woodring 1981). In the upper Trinity River basin,
any specific Caddoan regional affiliations are more
elusive, in part because of the small size of the
sherds in the collection (which make typological
identifications difficult at best), and limited descriptions or illustrations of the decorated sherds in site
assemblages (i.e., Peter and McGregor 1988b).
Based simply on geographical proximity, however,
one should look to Caddoan groups in the upper
Sabine and middle Red River for vessel form and
stylistic comparisons with the upper Trinity ceramics. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that a
Sanders Engraved vessel (a Caddoan carinated bowl
form manufactured between ca. A.D. 1100-1300 in
the upper Sabine and middle Red River areas) was
recovered in a burial context at the Upper Rockwall
site on the East Fork of the Trinity (Ross 1966:Figure 10e).
The relatively large ceramic assemblage from
the Cobb-Pool site (n--721 sherds) gives a good
sense of the character of the pre-A.D. 1300 ceramics in the upper Trinity River basin, even in the
absence of sherd illustrations (Peter and McGregor

Perttula et aL m Prehistoric Ceramics in Texas

1988b: 149-158). The site, essentially interpreted as
a single component occupation dated between ca.
A.D. 1000-1200, contains primarily grog-, quartzor grog-quartz-tempered ceramics decorated on the
body and rim with parallel incised lines or random
to parallel rows of fingernail punctations; the incised and punctated sherds account for 85 percent
of the decorated sherds (Peter and McGregor
1988b:Tables 9-12 and 9-17). The decorated sherds
represent about 29 percent of the sherd assemblage.
Engraving (8 percent), brushing (5 percent), and
interior slipped (2 percent) round out the decorated
ceramics from the site. What sets the Cobb-Pool
ceramic assemblage apart from contemporaneous
Caddoan sites in Northeast Texas is the amount of
plain shell (or fossil shell [Ferring 1988]) or shellquartz-tempered sherds from Cobb-Pool (129 sherds
or 18 percent of the ceramic assemblage [Peter and
McGregor 1988b:Tables 9-12 and 9-17]); as discussed above, plain shell-tempered ceramics are
absent from Caddo archeological sites in Northeast

191

Texas till after A.D. 1300. Plain shell-tempered
pottery, however, also occurs on several East Fork
Trinity River and Trinity River archeo!ogicat sites
that were primarily occupied before A.D. 1300 (see
Ross 1966; Sorrow 1966; Martin and Bruseth 1988),
as well as in a component at the Chicken House site
on the Red River in Cooke County, Texas that may
date between A.D. 1030 and A.D. 1280 (Prikryl
1994; see also Lorrain 1969). The earliest shelltempered pottery from this site is from plain flatbased flowerpot-shaped vessels (Figure 1 la-b).
Southwestern ceramics are rare in North Central Texas archeological sites prior to A.D. 1300.
After A.D. 1300, small quantities of Jornada
Mogollon brownwares, Chupadero black-on-white
sherds, and Rio Grande polychromes have been
found in sites on the upper Red River, the Clear
Fork of the Brazos, and on the Elm Fork of the
Trinity (see Krieger 1946; Prikryl 1990; see also
Millerâs discussion of West Texas Puebloan ceramics, below). This seems to reflect broad, regional

changes in trade and exchange relationships between Puebloan groups and Plains Village peoples
on the Southern Plains (see Spielmann 1991; Vehik
and Baugh 1994).
Certainly the most notable Southwestern ceramic find on the earlier Late Prehistoric sites, is
the stirrup-spout Arboles Black-on-White vessel recovered from the Lower Rockwall site on the East
Fork of the Trinity (Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968).
This vessel was manufactured between A.D. 9501050 (Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968:56), and petrographic analyses by McIntrye and McGregor (1982)
indicate that the basalt-tempered piece was manufactured among Puebloan groups along the upper
Rio Grande in New Mexico.
Where prehistoric archeological sites have been
radiocarbon dated in the North Central Texas region, plain shell-, fossil shell-, and calcareous-tempered (i.e., bone or crushed limestone) ceramic
wares dominate ceramic assemblages dating from
after ca. A.D. 1200/1300 to A.D. 1600. In most
particulars--temper, vessel forms, and surface treatment--these wares strongly resemble Plains Village ceramics from Washita River phase sites
(Richard Drass, 1994 personal communication to
Daniel J. Prikryl), and sites at Lake Texoma on the
Red River, in South Central Oklahoma (Bell 1984;
Brooks 1989, 1994). Washita River phase ceramic
assemblages have the following characteristics: (a)
they are coiled and smoothed; (b) a variety of calcareous tempers were used, but crushed shell was
preferred; (c) vessel forms are primarily globular
and vase-like (or "flowerpot") jars with round or
flat disk bases and outflaring rims; (d) decoration
of these vessels is minimal, principally consisting
of rows of nodes, applique fillets, lip tabs, as well
as vessel body cord-marking; and (e) also present
are small (7.5 cm in height), thick, barrel-shaped
cups with corncob-roughened exteriors and interior
surfaces that have a bright red/reddish-yellow staining (Bell 1984:318-320 and Figure 14.5).
In North Central Texas, this ware has been
called Nocona Plain, as defined by Krieger
(1946:110-111) primarily from the analysis of the
ceramics from the Harrell site at the confluence of
the Clear Fork of the Brazos and the main Brazos
River in Young County. It is one of the key defining characteristics of the Late Prehistoric Henrietta
focus (Krieger 1946:87-159), a rather nebulous archeological construct that groups together archeological remains along the upper Red River valley

and tributaries, such as the Wichita, Little Wichita,
and Pease rivers, and along the headwater areas of
the Trinity and Brazos rivers.
As Krieger (1946:110-111) defined the plain
shell-tempered pottery from the Harrell site, which
represented 95 percent of the 597 sherds in the
collection, it was primarily from rounded or globular jars with rounded bases, although deep bowls
were also present. He did note that plain shelltempered flowerpot jars with flat, extended bases
occur in Henrietta archeological components on the
upper Red River (Krieger 1946:111, 141). A few
sherds had rows of nodes at the rim-body juncture,
or vertical fingernail marks, crudely incised diagonal lines, and vertical striations on the rim, or impressions (stamped with a paddle or textile
impressed?) on the body of the vessel. The jar rims
were upright to outwardly flaring. Also present in
the Harrell site ceramic assemblage were 16 sherds
of a thick, molded ware from small bowls (4-8 cm
in height) with a reddish-yellowish paste and heavily
scored exterior surfaces, a sherd of southeastern
New Mexico brownware, and a sherd from a Late
Caddoan Poynor Engraved bowl (Krieger
1946:111).
Subsequent analyses of the ceramics found in
Henrietta sites since Kriegerâs time basically confirm his descriptions (e.g., Lorrain 1967, 1969; Martin 1994) of these wares. Studies by Prikryl (1990,
1994) of the shell-tempered pottery from Elm Fork
and Red River Plains Village components do indicate, however, that these post-A.D. 1300 ceramic
assemblages are much more variable in vessel form,
base shape, and temper inclusions than was recognized in Kriegerâs (1946) summary.
The variability within post-A.D. 1300 ceramic
assemblages can be illustrated in several respects.
For instance, limestone and limestone-shell tempered sherds amounted to 52 percent of the sherd
assemblage from the 13th and 14th century Dillard
site (41CO174) on the Red River, while contemporaneous sites nearby and upstream have more
than 93 percent crushed mussell shell tempering
(Lorrain 1967, 1969; Prikryl 1994). Furthermore,
Prikrylâs (1990:80) examination of sherds from the
Ledbetter site (41DN5) showed that most of what
had previously been considered shell-tempered
ceramics by Stephenson (1949) were actually tempered with bone, crushed limestone, and fossil
shell. Cord-marked globular jars, tempered with
bone and grit, are also present in ceramic assem-

Perttula et al. ~ Prehistoric Ceramics in Texas

blages on the upper Red River. Krieger (1946:131)
notes only a few cordmarked sherds from sites on
the Red River at the confluence with the Little
Wichita River, and these vessels are comparable to
the Lindsay Cordmarked ceramics found on contemporaneous Washita River phases in South Central Oklahoma (Bell 1984; Brooks 1989, 1994).
Finally, the kinds of vessels represented in these
assemblages includes more than simply jars and
deep bowls, namely: flat disk-based flowerpotshaped jars, round and flat-based globular jars
(some 40 cm in diameter and 60 cm in height
[Lorrain 1969]), deep straight-walled bowls, ollas,
short-necked bottles, and the thick molded bowls
or mugs (Prikryl 1994) (see Figure 11).
The globular jars, probably cooking jars, are
the most frequent vessel form in the post-A.D. !300
ceramics on the Red River (Figure !2). They have
an abundant calcareous temper (often leached out,
creating a porous surface), thin body walls (4-8
mm), smoothed surfaces (particularly on the exterior
of the vessel, with smoothing on interior surfaces

193

River locales; Lorrain (1967:200) called it
Redware. The hand-molded pottery is from thick
(10-20 ram) but small cylindrical mugs or bowls
(see Figure 1 li), 40-80 mm in diameter, with corncob-roughened exteriors and occasional random
brushing marks. The interiors of the mugs or bowls
are bright red and Lorrain (1967) and Bell (1984)
have speculated that this is possibly from holding
fire or perhaps they were used as cups that held an
ochreous paint.
Lorrain (1967:200, 1969) also identifies a thin
(2.7-3.5 mm), plain, blackware tempered with
burned and crushed mussel shell from the prehistoric Coyote and Glass sites in the Spanish Fort
area. An occasional bone, grit, or grog-tempered
sherd may also be found in the Red River ceramic
assemblages.
Other kinds of ceramic artifacts on post-A.D.
!200 Late Prehistoric Plains Village archeological
sites in North Central Texas include pottery beads,
pottery disks (spindle whorls?), clay figurine
fragments (Krieger 1946:141), and long-stemmed
pipes. The beads and disks are rarely found in
archeological contexts, but the long-stemmed clay

limited mainly to smoothing over the coil lines),
and they are almost always plain; 1-2 rows of nodes,
strap and loop handles, and diagonal incising are
rare decorative flourishes. Bases are predominantly
flat disks (Figure 13c-e), although conical or semirounded jars are also known (see Figure lle). Jar
rim sherds are strongly everted or outflaring (Figure
13a-b).
The thick, untempered, hand-molded pottery
(Figure 14) is present in post-A.D. I200 Late Prehistoric sites in the upper Brazos and upper Red

pipes have been recovered in some quantity in 13th
and 14th century contexts at sites on the Red River
(Lorrain 1969; Martin 1994). These pipes have
small-bore long-stems, and small bowls with simple
rounded lips (Martin 1994:Figure 34), and they have
a polished surface finish. Unlike the long-stemmed
pipes from Caddoan sites (cf. Hoffman 1967), those
on the Plains Village sites appear to have been
tempered with shell, as well as bone and grit.
Historic aboriginal ceramics have been found
in eighteenth century Nortefio phase archeological
sites, well-documented as related to the Wichitaspeaking Wichita, Tawakoni, Taovayas, and Waco
groups (cf. Newcomb 1993; Bell et al. 1967; Story
1985), in the upper Brazos, Trinity, and Red River
basins in North Central Texas. The ceramics include pottery vessels, globular pottery beads, elbow pipes, and unbaked clay figurines.
Pottery sherds or vessels are not apparently
common on Nortefio sites, as aboriginal ceramics

were being replaced by metal and tin containers
supplied to the Wichita peoples by European and
American traders. For instance, despite extensive
excavations at sites such as Longest (Bell and Bastian
1967) or Vinson (Smith 1993), less than 300 sherds
were recovered from either site, representing only a
handful of vessels. Moreover, some of the vessels
used by the Nortefios were not manufactured by
them, but were objects of trade from Puebloan or
Caddoan groups (e.g., Krieger ! 946). Caddoan vessels of the types Natchitoches Engraved, Simms
Engraved, and Hudson Engraved (manufactured by
Caddoan groups living several hundred miles downstream in the Great Bend area of the Red River) are
particularly notable trade vessels, as were northern
Rio Grande Puebloan ceramic wares.
Nortefio ceramics in North Central Texas include small, plain, globular jars, usually shell-tempered, but also bone-tempered or with a combination
of tempers (Gilmore 1967; Bell and Bastian 1967),
as well as bowls, carinated bowls, and bottles. The
plain jars have outflaring rims and flat disk bases,
and resemble what has been called Nocona Plain
on Late Prehistoric Plains Village sites in North
Central Texas. Petrographic analysis of Spanish Fort
sherds indicated that these jars were made from
local fossiliferous Permian clays (Gilmore 1967).
The non-jar vessel forms were usually decorated
with incised and engraved lines, fingernail
punctates, and brushing (Bastian 1967; Smith 1993),
and the design elements clearly resemble Caddoan
ceramics manufactured in Northeast Texas and
Southwest Arkansas in the eighteenth century (e.g.,
Schambach and Miller 1984). However, Gilmoreâs
(1967) petrographic analyses of Womack Engraved
and Emory Punctated-Incised sherds from Spanish
Fort sites suggests they were made of local Pleistocene clays or fossiliferous Permian clays.
Other plainwares in Nortefio sites includes Leon
Plain (see discussion of Leon Plain in Ricklis, this
paper) and Goliad Plain from the Vinson site (Smith
1993:114-115, 117). Bastian (1967) also notes a
highly polished, buff to dark brown, plain pottery
(tempered with bone, grit, and shell) from the Upper
Tucker site, while ridged or paddle-marked pottery
was identified by Krieger (1946:163) from the Spanish Fort sites that is similar to paddle-marked pottery from Wichita sites in South Central Kansas and
northern Oklahoma (Wedel 1959; Scott 1994).
The Wichita-speaking groups made distinctive
ceramic elbow pipes (see Story 1985:Figure 4a-aâ).
They had smoothed or polished conical bowls, and

slightly flaring thick-walled stems with short spurs
at the heel, and were usually plain, although
Womack Engraved motifs were added to pipe bowls
from Red River Wichita sites (Bell and Bastian
1967; Bastian 1967). The pipes were tempered with
a combination of grog, bone, or shell, and they had
compact pastes.
Human and animal figurines of a distinctive
reddish-brown clay are notable on Nortefio archeological sites; for example, some 74 clay figurines or
figurine fragments were recovered in excavations
at the Longest site (Bell and Bastian 1967). In addition to figurines with human shape (Figure 15c),
quadruped (horse?) and bird form figurines were

made of baked or unbaked clay. Bell and Bastian
(1967:95) suggest that the bird forms, subrectangular tablets (see Figure 15h-i), represent owls.
They also note that some unbaked figurine fragments had irregularly placed holes in them, as if the
holes could be used for the insertion of sticks. Fortyone similar figurines and fragments have been documented by Prikryl from sites on the Texas side of
the Red River opposite the Longest site; these are
in the Benton-Whiteside collection. The most common recognizable forms are horses (see Figure 15ab,f). One horse head figurine fragment has an
applique bridle, and other horse figurine fragments
have incised lines which appear to distinguish
manes. Other zoomorphic forms appear to represent dogs and birds (probably owls).

The Ceramics of the Toyah Horizon and the
Rockport Phase as Indicators of Some
Basic Sociocultural Patterns
Robert A. Ricklis
Beginning ca. A.D. 1250/1300, ceramics
became a regular part of archeological assemblages
in Central and southern Texas. In these regions,
bone-tempered pottery, more often than not
undecorated, appeared as part of a Late Prehistoric
material culture which included: Perdiz arrowpoints,
unifacial end scrapers, thin bifacially flaked knives,
flaked chert drills/perforators made on blades and/
or flakes, and a prismatic blade-core industry (e.g.,
Hester 1975, 1980; Prewitt 1981;
Black 1986; Highley 1986; Johnson
1994; Ricklis and Collins 1995). This
kind of pottery was manufactured by
Toyah folk until late in the
seventeenth century (Johnson [ 1994]
dates the Toyah phase from A.D.
1300 to 1660), although a corrected
radiocarbon date of A.D. 1770 + 60
(Beta-70658) has recently been
obtained from organic residue on the
walls of a Leon Plain olla-like vessel
from 41CV174 at Fort Hood (Abbott
1995:6-112).
On the central Texas coast, ceramics seem to have been made a slightly
earlier appearance. Pottery in this area
is generally made from sandy clays
which are indistinguishable from
much of the clayey sediments found
in the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation, the regionâs geologic foundation. Sandy paste
pottery has been found along the central coast associated with Scallorn arrowpoints (Story 1968), which
are well-dated in Texas to ca. A.D. 700-1250/1300
(Prewitt 1981, 1985). Ceramic technology probably
arrived in the region via the diffusion of ideas and
techniques from the upper Texas coast (Campbell
1961), where the regional pottery of the Mossy
Grove tradition (Story 1990) appeared some 2,000
years ago, probably in response to influences from
still farther afield in the Lower Mississippi Valley
area (Aten 1983). The earliest central coast pottery
was thus usually a plain, sandy paste ware similar to
the Goose Creek Plain potter,./of the upper Texas
coast (Story 1968; Ricklis 1990:Appendix A;
Weinstein 1992).

196

Texas Archeological Society

At least by ca. A.D. 1250/1300, asphaltum
was being applied as coating and/or decoration,
judging from radiocarbon dates associated with asphaltum surface-treated sherds at the Mellon site
(41RF21) (see Ricklis, this volume). Campbell
(1961) suggested that asphaltum-painted designs
(subsumed under the general typological designation of Rockport Black-on-Gray [see Suhm and
Jelks 1962]) may have been inspired by the blackon-white decorations on Huastecan ceramics found
along the Gulf coastal plain of Northeastern Mexico
(see Hester, this volume). However, the designs on
Rockport ware are not the same as those on
Huastecan pottery, and asphaltum coating/decoration may have been an intra-regional development.
The use of asphaltum as coating for baskets is well
documented for the Late Archaic on the central
coast (see Ricklis, this volume), and the transfer of
this practice to an introduced ceramic technology
would presumably not have involved any major
shifts in behavioral patterns.
The origins of inland, bone-tempered wares
(so-called Leon Plain [Suhm and Jelks 1962[) of
the central and southern Texas Toyah phase or horizon are less clear. With very rare exceptions, pottery appears rather abruptly in the archeological
record, in conjunction with Perdiz arrowpoints and
the other elements of the Toyah techno-complex,
and with an apparent emphasis on bison hunting
(Prewitt 1981, 1985; Black 1986; Johnson 1994;
see also discussions in Mallouf 1987; Huebner 1991;
Ricklis 1992). The apparent lack of in situ evolution of the Toyah ceramic tradition (judging by the
virtual absence of earlier pottery in the Toyah area)
suggests introduction from some other area or areas, which to date have not been identified (Johnson
[1994] suggests possible influences from the eastern margins of the greater American Southwest).
Leaving the question of origins aside, it is clear
that by A.D. 1300 two broadly definable ceramic
traditions were in place in Central and southern
Texas. The Toyah ceramic tradition of bonetempered pottery extended across a very large area,
from West Central Texas, into the northern part of
southern Texas and onto the inland part of the Gulf
coastal plain (see Figure 1). The coastal Rockport
ceramics are found in a narrow strip along the Gulf
coast, from the Colorado River delta on the north to
Baffin Bay on the south. The geographic
distributions of these two prehistoric pottery
traditions offer excellent opportunities to delineate
major cultural patterns, to define the spatial

boundary between the two, and by extension, to
gain insight into how prehistoric hunter-gatherer
populations interacted along a major cultural
boundary. To facilitate discussion, it is worthwhile
to summarize the salient characteristics of each of
these two major pottery traditions.

Salient Features of Toyah Ceramics
Descriptions of Toyah ceramics have appeared
in a number of publications in recent decades. A
typological description of the Leon Plain type, originally thought to be restricted to Central Texas, may
be found in Suhm and Jelks (1962). Later reports on
sites in the northern part of South Texas presented
additional descriptive data, which established that
bone-tempered plainware, essentially indistinguishable from Leon Plain, had a broader geographic
distribution than originally suggested. This pottery
has been found in moderate abundance in the Choke
Canyon area in Live Oak and McMullen counties
(Hall et al. 1986; Highley 1986), to the west along
the Rio Grande Plain (Hester 1975), as far south as
the Hinojosa site in Jim Wells County (Black 1986),
and along the coastal prairies inland from the central
Texas coast (Hester and Parker 1970; Ricklis 1990).
In general, the Toyah ceramics share a number of
common attributes: (a) the range of vessel forms
was limited, and included simple bowls, jars, and
constricted-neck ollas; (b) most vessels were undecorated; (c) pots were usually tempered with more
or less abundant amounts of crushed bone; and (d)
vessel surfaces, especially exteriors, tended to be
oxidized to various shades ranging from tan through
pinkish-orange to reddish colors (Figure 16).
Most recently, LeRoy Johnson (1994:187-210)
has presented a descriptive summary of Toyah pottery, based on examination of ceramics from the
Buckhollow site in Kimble County in West Central
Texas. Johnson (1994) identifies the following characteristics which he attributes to the pottery of what
he calls "classic" Toyah culture:

(a) the various bowl, jar, and olla forms were
constructed using thick coils or ropes of clay;
(b) pots were usually tempered with abundant
crushed bone, so that the bone constitutes up to
one-third of the prepared clay body;
(c) still-moist vessel interiors were often scraped
with bundles of small sticks, creating striated
surfaces;

Perttula et al. ~ Prehistoric Ceramics in Texas

Figure 16. Selected examples of Toyah horizon bonetempered pots, Central and southern Texas, based on

Mellon site, 41RF21 (Ricklis 1990).

(d) vessel exteriors were well-smoothed and frequently burnished or floated; and
(e) most vessel surfaces were oxidized to various
shades of pale pink or red.
Chemical analyses of residues scraped from
the walls of five Toyah vessels at the Rush site
(41TG346) provide significant insights into the use
of the vessels. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope
data suggest "that a single type of food was not
being prepared in all vessels" (Quigg and Peck
!995:148), but that bison bone grease/fat, mesquite
bean/bison bone grease, and deer/bison bone grease
were processed and cooked in broad ollas, large
jars, and/or bowls.
Other characteristics of Toyah pottery include
the occasional use of loop handles (e.g., Highley
1986; Ricklis 1990), and the presence on some pots
of a thin red wash or slip (the so-called Doss Redware

197

of Kelley [1947]; see also Hester and Hit1 [1971]
and Highley [1986]). Also, it should be pointed out
that not all Toyah pottery is devoid of other decorative elements. Black (1986) notes the occasional use
of asphaltum decoration on sherds from the Hinojosa
site, as did Hester and Parker (1970) for several
bone-tempered sherds from the Berclair site in Goliad
County. Although these sherds do not bear typical
Rockport ceramic decorations, they do suggest that
the practice of asphaltum painting was inspired from
the nearby Rockport pottery tradition of the central
Texas coast. Along the eastern margin of the Toyah
area in Central Texas (see Figure 1), a fair number
of pots had brushed exteriors, sometimes in conjunction with rows of punctations, both attributes
reminiscent in a general way of certain pottery types
further to the east in the Caddo area of eastern Texas
(e.g., Suhm 1955; Ricklis and Collins 1995). Petrographic analyses of selected sherds from Toyah phase
sites at Fort Hood and Hays County--focusing on
types of temper, frequency of non-plastic inclusions, and porosity--has been able to sort out the
ceramics made by Toyah groups from the grogtempered, low porosity ceramics manufactured by
Caddoan groups in Northeast Texas (Reese-Taylor
1995b; Reese-Tay!or et al. 1995). Interestingly, asphaltum decorations and Caddo-like surface treatment are both found, respectively, near the eastern
and southeastern margins of the Toyah area. This
suggests external stylistic influences from adjacent
cultural areas.

Rockport Ware
Although pottery has long been recognized as
part of the later prehistoric material culture
assemblage on the central Texas coast (e.g., Martin
1931; Sayles 1935), formal typological definitions
were not forthcoming until Suhm and Jelks (1962)
defined three types of Rockport ware: Rockport
Plain, Rockport Black-on-Gray, and Rockport
Incised. In general, Rockport vessels were
recognized as: (a) thin-walled pots built by the
coiling technique; (b) simple, rounded-base vessel
forms such as bowls, jars, and constricted-neck olla
or bottle-like shapes; and (c) were made of a sandy
paste clay body. Rockport Plain was defined to
include undecorated vessels of various shapes,
although minor decorative elements in the form of
lip notches or crenelations were included in the
type. Rockport Incised referred to pots with simple
geometric incised designs on the exterior rim section

198

of vessels. Rockport Black-on-Gray included
vessels with asphaltum surface treatment in the
form of coating and/or painted decorations
(straight or squiggly lines and/or dots).
In an examination of various technical,
formal, and decorative attributes on 464
Rockport ware rimsherds from four central
Texas coast sites, I was able to identify several
key correlations of specific attributes which
justified a revision of the Suhm and Jelks (1962)
ceramic typology. The ceramic samples came
from the Kirchmeyer site (41NU11) near Corpus
Christi, the McGloin Bluff site (41SP11) on the
north shore of Corpus Christi Bay, the Live
Oak Point site (41AS2) on Copano Bay, and the
Guadalupe Bay site (41CL2) on Guadalupe Bay,
an arm of San Antonio Bay (see Figure 1).
Ceramics from all four sites are housed at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The
University of Texas at Austin, where the
analyses were conducted.

Rockport B!ack-on-Gray I. The ceramic analysis revealed distinct clusterings of key attributes in
asphaltum coated/decorated pots, indicating that
Rockport Black-on-Gray can be divided into two
separate types. The diagnostic decorative element
on Rockport Black-on-Gray I is a band of asphaltuna paint along the lip, which was sometimes wide
enough to extend 1-2 cm onto the exterior rim of
the vessel. The lower portion of the vessel exterior
was sometimes coated with asphaltum, but vessel
interiors were nearly always left uncoated. Pots of
this type were generally fired in an oxidizing atmosphere, but one that was often not well-controlled,
since surface colors frequently are variable, ranging from light (oxidized) to gray or dark gray (reduced). Vessels were occasionally tempered with
sparse to moderate amounts of crushed bone. Pots
were most often bowls or jars; 91 percent of the
sherds of this type were from wide-mouth vessels.
Rockport Black-on-Gray H. This type has several diagnostic attributes. Decoration consists of:
(a) an asphaltum lip band, (b) vertical squiggly or
wavy lines extending from the lip band to the basal
portion of the pot, and sometimes (c) a circular
patch of asphaltum on the base of the vessel (see
Figure 17). In contrast to other Rockport types, the
majority of vessels (76 percent of the analyzed
sherds) were constricted neck olla or bottle-like
forms. Virtually all pots of this type bore interior
asphaltum coating. Vessels were consistently fired
in a well-controlled oxidizing atmosphere, so that
colors virtually always fall in the range from very
light buff to pale orange or pale red. Finally, pots
of this type were almost never tempered with
crushed bone (none of the sherds in the analyzed
sample were bone-tempered, and nearly all specimens examined from other Rockport sites are free
of bone temper).
The combination of attributes in Rockport
Black-on-Gray II pots suggests a specialized function for these vessels. Exterior asphaltum painting
would seemingly not be practical on a pot which
was to be used for cooking, since the asphaltum
would melt; similarly, the asphaltum coating on the
interior of virtually all pots of the type would hardly
be desirable in cooking pots. At the same time, the
common form for these pots--nanow-mouth ollas
or bottle-like shapes--would be well suited for
transport and/or storage of water or other liquids.

199

Also, the interior asphaltum coating would serve to
seal vessels used as water containers. Finally, the
consistent tack of bone tempering may be another
signature of non-cooking vessels, since the crushed
bone occasionally found in other Rockport types
may have served to lessen the effects of thermal
shock. The sand inclusions found in Rockport
Black-on-Gray II (and virtually all other Rockport
ware) would perhaps not serve very well, alone, as
a tempering agent in cooking vessels, since sand
has a very different coefficient of expansion and
contraction than does clay (Rice 1987:229).

Ceramics, Cultural Boundaries, and
Sociocultural Relations in the Late
Prehistory of Southern Texas
In addition to their importance as time markers, and as components of Late Prehistoric technology, Toyah and Rockport ceramics serve to
delineate, with some accuracy, the geographic
boundary between fundamentally different adaptive systems and, presumably, populations with divergent sociocultural traditions. Analyses of ceramic
samples from a number of Rockport phase and
Toyah horizon sites on Texasâ central coastal prairie strongly suggest that inland folk ranged within
about 40 km of the mainland shoreline, and that
this was the inland margin of the area used by
coastal people of the Rockport phase. Sites within
about 40 km of the mainland shoreline yield, for
the most part, ceramics which can be classified as
Rockport ware, whereas sites farther inland have
largely produced the bone-tempered plainware attributable to the Toyah horizon.
Since most Rockport phase sites on the coastal
prairie, away from intensively occupied shoreline
fishing camps, are small, with thin deposits and
low artifact densities (see Ricklis, this volume),
large ceramic samples are not available from any
given site. Sizeable samples of rim sherds are not,
therefore, available from these sites with which to
conduct statistically reliable typologica! analyses.
However, it is possible to distinguish samples of
Rockport ware from Toyah pottery on the basis of
key attributes which can be observed on even the
smallest sherds.
As may be seen in Figure 18, in ceramic
samples from shoreline sites, which clearly represent
occupation by coastal groups, approximately 50

treatment, as coating and/or painted decoration
(these data and all others, except from the Hinojosa
site, are based on vessel counts, as represented by
sherds which can be sorted into vessel groups based
on attributes of color, hardness, surface treatment,
and aplastic inclusions; the Hinojosa ceramic data
are derived from a select sample of 100 individual
sherds [Black 1986]). Additionally, Figure 19 shows
percentages of sherd groups in samples from
Rockport phase sites with no bone temper, and
sparse, moderate, and profuse bone temper (using
for the sake of comparison, Blackâs [1986]
definitions of sparse, moderate, and profuse bone
temper as representing, respectively, <5 percent, 525 percent, and >25 percent of the total volume of
the sherd). The percentage breakdowns of asphaltum
surface-treated pots versus pots without asphaltum,
and pots with varying amounts of bone tempering,
are thus effective "signatures" of coastal Rockport

ware by virtue of the redundant similarities in the
proportional representation of these attributes.
Ceramics from inland Toyah sites on the
coastal plain show marked contrasts in terms of
these basic attributes. The Hinojosa site (41JW8) in
Jim Wells county, west of Corpus Christi, is an
excellent point of departure for Rockport-Toyah
comparisons, since: (a) the site is clearly attributable
to the Toyah horizon, and (b) Black (1986) has
quantified data on the key attributes which can be
readily compared to the Rockport ceramic data. As
shown at the top of Figure 20, in Blackâs (1986)
"select" analytical sample of 100 sherds from
Hinojosa, only 11 percent bear asphaltum surface
treatment. The percentage breakdown of sherds
without bone temper versus those with sparse,
moderate, and profuse crushed bone is, respectively,
4 percent, 27 percent, 53 percent, and 16 percent
(Figure 21). If the Hinojosa pottery can be taken to
be more or less representative of coastal plain Toyah
ceramics, then it can be concluded that even limited
pottery samples, consisting perhaps of mostly small
sherds, can be said to have markedly differing
attribute signatures, according to whether they
represent coastal or interior peoples and culturaladaptive patterns.
In fact, the signatures for Rockport ceramics
and for the Hinojosa Toyah pottery have proved to

margin of the Rockport phase area, at just that
point where one may expect to find a Late
Prehistoric cultural boundary. As shown in
Figures 22 and 23, small Rockport phase sites on
the Aransas River (41SP159, 41SP167, and
41SP170-North component), all about 40 km
from the mainland shoreline, have very similar

were occupied during the fall-winter, and that
Rockport phase sites saw spring-summer
occupations. A seasonal, ecological complementarity in boundary zone use is
suggested, with Toyah folk moving in small
groups into the boundary zone to fill the void
created as Rockport people tended to
aggregate at large fall-winter fishing camps
on the coast (see Ricklis 1990, and Ricklis,
this volume).
At the Mellon site, the spatially discrete
Rockport and Toyah components may represent simultaneous use of the site. Abundant
bison and deer bones were found in test units
and excavations across most of this small site,
indicating that it was a locus for more or less
intensive butchering/processing of large game

1987), through Central Texas (Prewitt 1981, 1985;
Johnson 1994; Ricklis and Collins 1995), into
southern Texas (Hester 1975; Black 1986; Highley
1986), and onto the central and upper Texas coasts
(Ricklis 1992, 1994). While this may or may not
reflect differences in the spatial scale of female vs.
male inter-group relations, it does warn against
assumptions concerning the utility of lithic data as
an indicator of the geography of prehistoric
sociocultural patterns. Regardless of the broader
implications of the widespread distribution of a lithic
package, the more localized ceramic expressions
suggest that pottery is the more reliable indicator of
social identity, and cautions against assumptions
that lithic horizon styles or techno-complexes
directly represent the distributions of cultural,
ethnic, or linguistic groups.

Prehistoric and Protohistoric Ceramics from
the Lower Plains, Caprock Canyonlands,
and Texas Panhandle
Timothy K. Perttula and
Christopher Lintz
Emerging material culture patterns suggest that
the Texas Panhandle, Caprock Canyonlands, and
Lower Plains regions have been a vascillating border area for at least three diverse ceramic wares or
ceramic traditions. These include: (a) a cord-marked
ware derived from the Plains (to the north, east, and
northwest) which is found mostly in the upper Texas
Panhandle but also in the lower plains of North
Central Texas (e.g., Krieger 1946); (b) a mediumpasted plain brownware primarily found in the lower
panhandle, the Caprock Canyonlands, and the

203

Lower Plains that appears to have been derived
from the Southwest (principally the Jornada
Mogollon area); and (c) a thin, dark sandy to micaceous paste plain ware found throughout these regions in Protohistoric contexts (after ca. A.D. 1450),
and apparently deriving from the north central portions of New Mexico (see general summaries in
Hofman and Brooks 1989; Brooks 1989; Hofman
1989). The recognition of these three general ceramic wares oversimplifies the tremendous range
of variability present in the ceramic assemblages
found on aboriginal sites in these regions. For the
most part, the gross delineation of ceramic types
has been used as a crude temporal and cultural
indicator, and we archeologists have a long way to
go in recognizing and refining the temporal, spatial, and cultural significance of the ceramics used
in these areas.
The earliest prehistoric ceramics manufactured
in the upper Texas Panhandle appeared about ca.
A.D. 400 (e.g., Couzzourt 1985, 1988). They are
closely related to the Plains Woodland ceramics
found in Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Colorado (cf. Bozell and Winfrey 1994:Figure 2a-d;
Vehik 1984) in that they are large, thick-walled,
conical or conoidal-shaped vessels,1 and have completely cord-roughened exterior surfaces with little
to no rim or lip decoration. The small assemblage
of sherds from such sites as Lake Creek (Hughes
1962) and Tascosa Creek (Couzzourt 1985, 1988)
are dominated by these thick cord-roughened vessels, tempered with crushed rock (usually quartz
and carbonate, but scoria-tempered [Hughes et al.
1978:102] and basalt-tempered [Quigg et al.
1993:149] wares are also known in parts of the
Texas Panhandle) and bone. Diagonal incising is
the only other apparent decorative element represented in these Texas Panhandle WOodland ceramic
assemblages. Smooth-finished sherds with crushed
plagioclase feldspar temper found associated with
cord-marked Woodland vessels on these early sites
have been tentatively identified as intrusive
Mogollon brownwares, probably Alma Plain
(Hughes 1991:26-27).

~A whole Woodland period pot of unknown provenience in the collections of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum stands
33 cm high with an orifice diameter of 33 cm. It has a conical base, and the vesselâs maximum diameter is not at the rim, but farther
down on the body; the walls are 8-9 mm thick at the rim. Stick impressions were present on the lip of the pot, and just below the
rim were two parallel incised lines with punctations between the lines (A. J. Taylor, personal communication to Christopher Lintz,
1995).

In the Caprock Canyonlands, the earliest ceramics date from between about A.D. 200 and A.D.
1100, based on radiocarbon dates from the
Deadmanâs Shelter (41SW23), Sam Wahl
(41GR291), South Sage Creek (41KT33), and Kent
Creek (41HL66) sites (Willey and Hughes 1978;
Boyd et al. 1992, 1994; Cruse 1992; see also Boyd,
this volume). The ceramics from these Palo Duro
Complex sites appear to uniformly be Mogollon
brownwares--including Jornada Brown, Middle
Pecos Micaceous Brown, and Roswell Brown-and the petrographic analyses by Robinson (1992,
1994) suggest they were manufactured in the
Middle Pecos valley in southeastern New Mexico.
Eastern Jornada Mogollon occupations (the
Querecho phase) dating towards the end of this
period (ca. A.D. 950-1100) on the southwestern
part of the Llano Estacado had locally-made
brownwares as well as a few Puebloan tradewares
(e.g., Corley 1965).
Locally-manufactured Plains Village (ca. A.D.
1100/1200-1450/1500) ceramics in the Texas and
Oklahoma panhandles include the large globularbodied Borger Cordmarked vessels in the Antelope
Creek phase (see Krieger 1946:44; Suhm and Jelks
1962:15; Lintz 1984:333-335; J. Hughes 1991:3233), and the cord-marked and distinctive rim/lip
decorated ceramics from the Buried City complex
along Wolf Creek (Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987;
D. Hughes 1991). These Late Prehistoric cordmarked ceramics are undoubtedly related to the
earlier Woodland ceramic tradition in the region.
Across most of the Llano Estacado and Caprock Canyonlands, the few ceramics that are found
on Late Prehistoric campsites include Jornada
Mogollon E1 Paso brownwares, Puebloan
polychromes, and Chupadero Black-on-white vessels from the Salinas Pueblo area along the Pecos
River in eastern New Mexico (e.g., Johnson
1978:107, 1993, 1995; Krieger 1946:77-81;
Holliday and Johnson 1990:45). However, along
the southwestern edge of the Llano Estacado, relatively sedentary groups were manufacturing their
own local brownwares and corrugated utility vessels (and then later indented brownwares [Collins
1969]), and were trading for painted Puebloan wares
in the Mimbres, Salinas, northern Rio Grande, and
Three Rivers areas of New Mexico (see summary
in Baugh 1994).
Suhm and Jelks (1962:15) provide the most
thorough description of Borger Cordmarked. This

is an elongated to globular jar (made by coiling
clay ropes) with short vertical to flaring rims (Figure 24), 20-30 cm in height with orifice diameters
ranging between 14-22 cm. Crushed rock (usually
quartz) and sand were used as temper, along with
mica, bone, or other inclusions. The jars have convex bases, and generally thin walls, perhaps thinner
near the base than the rim. The rim and body of the
vessels are covered with fine vertically-placed cord
impressions on the upper body which overlap considerably near the base (sometimes the cord impressions are smoothed over) from paddles used in
shaping and weld{rig the vessels, and rarely with
incisions, punctations, and notches on the rim and
lip; red, gray, and black washes or slips have also
been documented in a few Antelope Creek phase
ceramic assemblages.
In a sample of 272 rims from five Antelope
Creek phase sites (McGrath, Black Dog Village,
Two Sisters, Stamper, and Roy Smith), Lintz
(1978:Figure 6) noted that: 65 percent were only
plain or had cordmarking, 7 percent had diagonal
punctations on the lip, 6.3 percent had pinched liprim junctures, and 6.6 percent had a single row of
fingernail gouges around the rim; the other 7
percent of the rims were represented by dotpunctated lips and rims, diagonal incised lines, lip
tabs, or had distinctive collared and cambered rims.
Brushed bodies, fingernail punctates on the vessel
shoulder, and parallel trailed lines on the body, are
other rare decorative elements in the Antelope
Creek ceramic medium. There is a relatively high
percentages of decorated rims (particularly pinched
rims, as well as the diagonal incising) in the
ceramic samples from the Roy Smith, Stamper, and
Two Sisters sites in the Oklahoma Panhandle. This
suggests interaction between these Antelope Creek
phase groups and the Buried City Complex, on
Wolf Creek in the northeastern part of the Texas
Panhandle, because rim decorated vessels with
similar decorative elements are much more
common in the Buried City Complex (cf. Hughes
1991; see below for discussion of Buried City
Complex ceramics).
The general shape and form of the Borger
Cordmarked vessels, and the soot-blackened and
smudged exterior and interior surfaces, certainly
indicate that these were cooking jars. Exactly what
was being cooked in the jars is uncertain, as
organic residues on the vessels have not been
studied, but stable carbon isotope analysis of

Perttula et al. ~ Prehistoric Ceramics in Texas

present as trade wares in small amounts. Lintz
and Reese-Taylorâs (1995) petrographic analysis of collared and non-collared rims in Antelope Creek phase, Buried City, and Upper
Republican assemblages suggests that many of
the collared rim vessels were made in the Panhandle, probably by the Buried City Complex
groups, and do not represent tradewares from
Central Plains Tradition groups. Miniature vessels (5-6 cm in height), unfired and not coiled,
have been recovered from Spring Canyon
(Duffield 1964), site 41MO7 (Green 1986:41),
Saddleback (Holden 1934:39), Chicken Creek
(Schmidt-Couzzourt 1983), and Coetas Ruin 55
(Studer 1934).
In the Buried City Complex, the locallymanufactured ceramics are the large globular or
subconoidal jars, but unlike in the Antelope
Creek phase, these vessels often have high and
slightly flaring rims (D. Hughes 1991:Figures
25 and 26; Hughes and Hughes-Jones 1987:Figures 16 and 17; whole globular and subconoidal
vessels with high and flaring rims found in a
feed lot in Darrouzett, Texas appear to be related to the Buried City Complex [Jackson et al.
1982:108-109]). Again, a mixture of temper inclusions were used, including bone, caliche,
sand, grog, shell, and scoria, with a fine quartz
sand being most frequently employed as an

of western Kansas (see Wedel 1959:575-576); in
that the Geneseo Plain and Simple Stamped pottery is decorated with applied fillets as well as
single and double rows of pinches and gouges,
there are stylistic resemblances. However, the
Geneseo ceramics from Kansas are smooth-surfaced (not cord-impressed), often have flat bases,
and have loop handles (Scott 1994:71), ceramic
attributes that are not characteristic of the Buried
City Complex ceramic assemblages.
In contrast to the Plains Village cord-marked,
globular jar ceramic traditions in the Canadian
River basin of the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, Puebloan ceramics are widely distributed
on the Llano Estacado at this time (as are the New
Mexican glazewares from the Galisteo Basin, although they appear to be concentrated in the Plains
Village sites on the Canadian River [Spielmann
1983:Figure 6]), and local ceramic traditions appear to be absent except for those of the eastern
extension of the Jornada Mogollon. Krieger
(1946:77-81) had noted some 50 years ago that
nearly all the ceramics found in dune areas, lake
beds, and by springs on the Llano were manufactured by Jornada Mogollon and other Puebloan
groups. Most recently, Johnson (1995) states that
the most frequent Puebloan ceramics on the southern High Plains found in contexts dating between
ca. A.D. 950-1450 include Chupadero Black-onwhite, Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta, Jornada
Brown, and E1 Paso Brownware (see Table 3).
Ochoa Indented brownware, made by eastern
Jornada Mogollon groups after ca. A.D. 1350, is
also broadly distributed on the Llano Estacado,
from the White River south to the Midland area
(Johnson 1993:Figure 12.4).
These eastern Jornada Mogollon groups on the
southwestern part of the Llano Estacado continued
to manufacture plain brownwares, corrugated jars,
and after A.D. 1350 the Ochoa Indented

207

brownware. Northern Rio Grande tradewares
became common after ca. A.D. 1300, and included
polychromes, black-on-whites, black-on-reds, and
yellow-glazed wares from the Salado, Upper Rio
Grande, Salinas, and Three Rivers areas of New
Mexico and Arizona, as well as Ramos Polychrome
from northern Chihuahua (Casas Grandes) (Collins
1971). The Salt Cedar site in Andrews County,
Texas, one of the more important eastern Jornada
Mogollon sites on the Llano Estacado, had
Puebloan tradewares such as Agua Fria Glaze-onred, Chupadero Black-on-white, E1 Paso
polychrome, and San Clemente Glaze A
polychrome (Collins 1968).
The character of aboriginal ceramics found on
campsites and villages across the Texas Panhandle
and Llano Estacado, as well as in the. Caprock
Canyonlands and the Lower Plains, changed
greatly after ca. A.D. 1450. The ceramic wares are,
with few exceptions, dominated by Northern Rio
Grande glazewares (glazes III-VI or C-F) and thin,
dark plain utility wares of one sort or another,2
most closely resembling Southwestern-style culinary pottery, particularly those made in the Pecos
and Galisteo pueblos (see Habicht-Mauche 1987,
1988, 1991; Boyd and Reese-Taylor 1993; Baugh
1986, 1992; Baugh and Eddy 1987; Spielmann
1983). Red River Late Caddoan style ceramics are
also present in small amounts, particularly in the
Edwards phase sites in western Oklahoma? These
changes in the composition of ceramic assemblages
appear to be related to the development of new and
more intensive forms of economic interaction and
exchange between the Pueblo farmers of the Rio
Grande, the bison hunters of the southern High
Plains, and horticultural villages communities on
the Red, Washita, and Canadian rivers in western
Oklahoma.
Spielmann (1983:268) concluded that the local manufacture of ceramics on the southern High

2Some Texas archeologists have referred to this kind of plain micaceous ceramics as "Apache pottery" (Hughes 1991;
Holliday and Johnson 1990; Johnson 1987), which is an inappropriate ethnic and cultural appellation, if not downright inaccurate,
given: (a) the difficulty in visually sorting it from utility wares produced at Pecos and Galisteo pueblos, and (b) the divergent
findings from the petrographic and compositional studies conducted on these utility wares by Boyd and Reese-Taylor (1993),
Peck (1993 ), and Habicht-Mauche (1987, 1988, 1991). The 1985 Southern Athapaskan Ceramics Conference had codified this
as an Apachean ware, Llano Estacado Gray Ware (Baugh and Eddy 1987).
3Twenty-five sand and shell-tempered sherds (90 percent sand and 10 percent shell inclusions) from the Floydada Country
Club site were identified as Caddoan because of the shell tempering and a similarity to Caddoan utility wares (Word 1991:77),
but this is unlikely because Caddoan shell-tempered vessels along the Red River do not contain sand tempering.

208

Texas Archeological Society

Plains ceased after ca. A.D. 1450,4 as the Llano
Estacado bison hunters obtained the Rio Grande
wares as their main source of ceramics in exchange
for bison meat, hides, and related products.
Through time (by ca. A.D. 1600) as the exchange
system evolved, the Pecos and Picuris glazewares
had replaced the glazewares produced for the market from the Galisteo and Tonque pueblos. In plotting the distribution of post-A.D. 1450 Rio Grande
ceramic glaze wares, Spielmann (1983:Figure 6)
also noted that they appeared to be concentrated on
sites along the major waterways that originate in,
and flow east out of, New Mexico, specifically
along the White River and the Prairie Dog Town
Fork, as well as Tierra Blanca Creek (a tributary
of the Prairie Dog Town Fork) and the North Fork
of the Red River. In major protohistoric Garza and
Tierra Blanca Complex components such as
Bridwell (41CB27), Montgomery (41FL17), Pete
Creek (41CB1), and Blackburn (41RD20), Rio
Grande glazewares may amount for as much as 75
percent of the ceramic assemblages (e.g., Baugh
1986:Table 4; Spielmann 1983); they may be lacking entirely from Tierra Blanca and Garza camps
where micaceous utility wares are better represented along with smaller amounts of sandy-paste
Edwards Plain and grog-tempered Little Deer Plain
(see Baugh [ 1986:170-172] for definitions of these
Southern Plains utility wares).
At the time of Spielmannâs (1983)
consideration of Puebloan-Southern Plains
exchange systems, the thin, plain micaceous utility
wares on Southern High Plains sites were
considered to have also been manufactured by
Puebloan groups, probably at Pecos Pueblo given
their resemblances to Blind Indented Corrugated
and Faint-Striated jars at Pecos Pueb!o (Kidder and
Shepard 1936). However, petrographic analyses of
utility ware sherds--and variability in tempers,
paste, textures and finish, vessel size, and color-from Garza, Tierra Blanca, and Wheeler phase sites

by Habicht-Mauche (1987, 1988, 1991) suggested
that these culinary ceramics were more likely to
represent ceramics locally produced by High Plains
bison hunters, but out of a shared Southwestern
ceramic tradition (Habicht-Mauche 1987:184);
nevertheless, a small percent of the utility wares
were thought to have been actually obtained in
trade from Rio Grande pueblos (Habicht-Mauche
1991:67).
Given these findings, the Southern Plains striated utility ceramics were assigned to a new type,
Tierra Blanca Plain (Habicht-Mauche 1987:178180, 1988:217-272), named after the protohistoric
component at the Tierra Blanca site in Deaf Smith
County, Texas. It is a thin (averaging 3-5 mm),
coil-constructed ware of "small-to-medium globular to slightly elongated jars with everted rims and
gently curving shoulders" (Habicht-Mauche
1987:180; Figure 25). The exterior surfaces, brownish gray to black in color, were smoothed to faintly
striated, probably by scraping with a corn cob, and
only rarely decorated with two to three parallel
rows of fingernail punctations (see Figure 25d).
The paste is slightly sandy, with silica-rich crushed
rocks added as temper, and variable amounts of
mica particles are also present as a paste constituent, but it is not considered by Habicht-Mauche
(1987:178) as a "micaceous" ware.
The study of 17th century ceramic assemblages
from the Headstream (41KT51) and Longhorn
(41KT53) sites in the Double Mountain Fork of the
Brazos River basin provide a different perspective
on the character and place of aboriginal ceramics
among bison-hunting groups living in the Caprock
Canyonlands (Boyd et at. 1993). Puebloan redwares,
glazewares, and matte paint wares accounted for 58
percent of the estimated 31 vessels at the two sites,
probably originating mainly from Pecos Pueblo,
but also from the Santa Clara (Tewa) and Salinas
pueblos of the northern Rio Grande (Boyd and
Reese-Taylor 1993; Peck 1993); Pecos-style tubu-

4Garza components at Lubbock Lake and Lott do provide clear evidence that locally-manufactured ceramics are part of the
material culture assemblage of these Southern Plains bison hunters. At Lubbock Lake, the local ware is a thick, grit-tempered
ceramic with brushing and corncob impressions (Johnson et al. 1977:Figure 4e; Johnson 1978:Figure 27x, 1987:115); Johnson
(1987:115) indicates this ware has been found in protohistoric contexts in sites on the southern half of the Llano Estacado. The
local ware at the Lott site is a bone-tempered ceramic manufactured from Triassic clays, and decorated with incised diagonals,
parallel lines, and rows of punctations; vessel forms are bowls,jars, and carinated bowls (Runkles and Dorchester 1987). A sherd
of thick grit temper, with brushing and corncob impressions, was also present in the Lott site ceramic assemblage (Group I in
Runkles and Dorchester [1987]).

lar pipes (Boyd et al. 1993:Figure 82) were also
found at both sites.
Plain utility and micaceous utility vessels
represent a minimum of 13 vessels at Headstream
and Longhorn. Technologically and stylistically
these wares cannot be distinguished from either
Tierra Blanca Plain or the Pecos or Picuris Pueblo
Faint Striated utility wares. However, based on the
petrographic analysis of sherds from these
Justiceburg Reservoir sites as well as the examination of petrographic data and ceramic thin
sections from Pecos Pueblo and Tierra Blanca Plain,
and X-Ray flourescence of paste composition, Boyd
and Reese-Taylor (1993:374-375) conclude that:
(1) the plain utility wares are from the same sources
as the glazewares, most probably Pecos Pueblo, as
they have the same variability in pastes and that (2)
these culinary wares "probably represent
Puebloan...rather than Plains-made wares." Thus,
they question the utility of Tierra Blanca Plain if it
refers to Southern Plains-made striated culinary
wares or to a "widespread indigenous Plains ceramic
tradition" (Boyd and Reese-Taylor 1993:375), and
point out the need for further study of the

209

compositional variability of Puebloan plain and
striated utility wares
Although no Northern Rio Grande glazewares
were recovered in the investigations at Palo Duro
Reservoir in Hansford County, Texas, another interesting protohistoric (with three radiocarbon dates
averaging A.D. 1550 and a TL date of A.D. 1655 +
155) ceramic assemblage was recovered from
41HF8, Block C, along Palo Duro Creek in the
northernmost part of the Texas Panhandle (Quigg
et al. 1993). Reconstrnctable sections of three quartz
sand-tempered vessels were found in Block C
(Qu!gg et al. 1993:Figure 5.61), including: a small
(14 cm orifice diameter) bean pot with smooth,
non-striated exterior surfaces; a second smoothedsurface vessel with a vertical to outflating rim and
constricted neck (12-13 cm orifice diameter); and a
small, molded globular "cup" with flared lip and
slightly restricted orifice.
Petrographic analyses indicate that these utility vessels were made in the Panhandle, using clays
from outwash alluvial sediments with a fine quartz
sand added as temper (Reese-Taylor 1993). It is
notable that mica is lacking in the paste, whereas
the Tierra Blanca Plain ceramics in contemporaneous Tierra Blanca, Garza, and Wheeler phase usually have small to moderate amounts of finely
crushed mica in their pastes (Habicht-Mauche
1991:59).

Concluding Comments on Panhandle,
Caprock Canyonlands, and
Lower Plains Ceramics
Our understanding of prehistoric and protohistoric ceramic variability in the Lower Plains,
Caprock Canyonlands, and Texas Panhandle regions has been hindered by the completion of few
large archeological projects within the past 50 years.
These types of projects can provide an opportunity
to examine a suite of temporally and culturally distinct ceramic sites. However, there has been an
uneven archeological emphasis on excavating
mostly prominent Late Prehistoric village sites with
abundant artifacts, including pottery, the recovery
of mostly small and often culturally mixed ceramic
assemblages from other time periods, and until recently, a tendency to utilize a lumpers (as opposed
to a splitters) approach in studying ceramics with
the primary goal of delineating gross temporal
trends. Few attempts have been made to rigorously

and the other ends, as well as any cultural connotations inherent in such divisions, remains mostly a
matter of conjecture at this time. Simply for ease of
presentation, we consider the Jornada Mogo!lon
portion of West Texas as including the areas where
ceramic production occurred, or else where ceramics are commonly found in abundance. This generally encompasses the basin and range physiographic
zone west of a line drawn along the Guadalupe and
Delaware Mountains, then roughly following the
Cermnics of the Jornada Mogollon and
southern boundary of Culberson County to the Rio
Trans-Pecos Regions of West Texas

Grande valley to a point near the town of Redford,

Lukowski 1981; Miller 1994; Rohrt and Skinner
1974); the Delaware Mountains (Miller 1994); and
the Diablo Mountains (Cherry and Torrence 1973).
E1 Paso Brownware is also commonly found
along the Rio Grande Valley for several hundred
miles (Betancourt 1981; Johnson 1977; Kelley
1948). This includes the La Junta district at the
confluence of the Rio Grande and Conchos rivers
in the vicinity of Presidio (Beckes 1975; Kelley
1939, 1949, 1953, 1985; Kelley et al. 1940; Mallouf
1985; Shackleford 1951, 1955).
Production of E1 Paso Brownware ceramics
probably took place in several of these areas, particularly at settlements presumably affiliated with agricultural economies in the Salt Flat Basin and the Rio
Grande corridor. Several settlements in these areas
have typical Jornada Mogollon ceramic assemblages,
with the addition of arrow point technologies more
closely resembling those of the Trans-Pecos region
(Ackerly et al. 1987; Miller 1994). Verification of
production zones outside the Hueco Bolson will
require chemical compositional analysis such as that
undertaken by Ekland (1977), and offers an intriguing study for the future. Also interesting is the relatively common occurrence of both Viejo and Medio
period Chihuahuan ceramics in the southern part of
the region (Skinner et al. 1973, 1974; Martin 1990;
Miller 1992a; Hamilton n.d.).
The frequency of Jornada Mogollon ceramics
declines markedly as one progresses east of the line
dividing the Jornada Mogollon and Trans-Pecos
regions. Sporadic occurrences of E1 Paso
Brownware sherds have been noted in the Eagle
Mountains south of Van Horn (Creel 1991; Howard
1994; Jackson 1932, 1937; Miller 1992b), at
Granado Cave and Caldwell Ranch in the Rustler
Hills north of Van Horn (Hamilton n.d.; Tanner
1949), a small number of rockshelters throughout
the Big Bend region (Hilton 1986; Mallouf 1985),
and even north into the Texas Panhandle (Boyd
1993; Johnson 1993, 1995; see also Boyd, this volume). It can be reasonably assumed that these occurrences resulted from interregional exchange
networks rather than local production.
In the Jornada Mogollon region, E1 Paso
Brownware ceramics are found at large pithouse
and pueblo residential sites situated along the well-

211

watered alluvial flanks of mountain chains, playa
basins, and river valleys, as well as at virtually
thousands of srnalt, short-term settlements distributed throughout interior desert basins. Collections
of 30,000 or more sherds have been recovered from
sites such as Hueco Tanks Village (41EP2A), Hot
Well Pueblo (FB6363), and Firecracker Pueblo
(41EP25). While the larger samples occur on residential sites, small collections of sherds are commonly found distributed across interior basins.
Technologically, the E1 Paso ceramic tradition
is characterized by a distinctive coarse-grained temper of crushed igneous rock, usually granite or syenite, with feldspar, quartz, and sometimes biotite
mica being the primary non-plastic inclusions.
Sherds often have a dark carbon streak, and surface
colors range from dark red to light brown or tan,
depending upon clay sources and firing conditions.
Surface finishes are usually smoothed, wiped, or
sometimes self-floated, and are uneven with numerous temper pits and drag marks clearly visible.
From the earliest typological descriptions
(Lehmer 1948; Mera 1938, 1943; Runyan and
Hedrick 1973; Stallings 1931), E1 Paso Brownware
has been traditionally classified into three types
based on stylistic and chronological criteria: an undecorated type known as E1 Paso Brown or Plain
Brown, and two painted types designated E1 Paso
Bichrome and E1 Paso Polychrome. It should be
noted that the terms E1 Paso Bichrome and E1 Paso
Polychrome are somewhat misleading. E1 Paso
Bichrome is actually a monochrome, with a red (or
rarely a black) pigment applied to the otherwise
undecorated and unslipped, plain, brown vessel surface. Likewise, E1 Paso Polychrome should be considered a bichrome, with both red and black paint
applied to the vessel surface. However, the original
descriptive terms are here retained due to their primacy in the archeological literature.
Despite over four decades of archeological
work, developmental ceramic chronologies for West
Texas are still poorly known. The general ceramic/
architectural phase sequence outlined in Lehmerâs
(1948) seminal study of the Jornada Branch of the
Mogollon continues to be a standard reference,
despite its publication date of over 40 years ago.
Several modifications and refinements to the
sequence have been proposed over the past 20 years,
mostly through the pioneering work of Michael
Whalen (1977, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1985)in the
Hueco Bolson, and David Carmichael (1983, 1986)

rim form. Early E1 Paso Brown has contracting rim
walls and pointed (or "pinched") lips, while the
later variety dating to ca. A. D. 1000 or 1050 tends
towards more uniform rim walls with flat or rounded
lips. Recent studies have demonstrated how variations in these rim forms reflect increases in orifice
diameter and vessel size, and therefore demonstrate
a shift to the production and use of slightly larger,
wider-mouthed vessels at ca. A.D. 1000.
Aside from minor changes in rim form and
orifice diameter, many researchers have noted the
otherwise almost complete lack of variation for most
of the 500-700 year span of plain brownware production (Whalen 1993, 1994a, 1994b; Miller n.d.).
It is easy to bemoan this lack of variation, particularly since it has been extremely difficult to identify
chronological trends in brownware production, not
to mention the inability to construct a ceramic
seriation which could aid in site dating. Reed (1991),

on the other hand, proposed that this should be
viewed more as a function of a highly stable, successful adaptation to the semi-arid basin and range
environments of West Texas, a position which, rather
than viewing ceramics as simply a chronological
device, integrates them into an overall conception
lining ceramic technology and settlement adaptations. The lack of functional changes in rim and
vessel form indicates that the role of ceramics in
hunting and gathering adaptations may not have
changed appreciably for most of the Mesilla phase,
although this interpretation merits further research
through more controlled technological analyses of
E1 Paso Brownware temper, paste, strength, and
thermal resistivity characteristics.
The period from A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1250 witnessed several developments in local ceramic production, as well as changes in the inventories of
non-local ceramic types. Beginning sometime in
the eleventh or early twelfth century, painted varieties of E1 Paso Brownware first appear. As seen in
Table 4, there is no clear chronological division
between the production dates for undecorated E1
Paso Brown and the two painted types: E1 Paso
Bichrome and early variants of E1 Paso Polychrome.
Instead, current evidence suggests that all three
types were either produced contemporaneously, or
represent a rapid development and sequential replacement of types within a relatively brief period
of 100-150 years. At present, evidence for either
position is equivocal. However, a notable aspect of
this period is that the three traditional types as defined on the basis of decorative attributes all have
nearly identical vessel forms. E1 Paso Bichrome
and early/transitional E1 Paso Polychrome vessel
forms continue the pattern of predominantly
neckless jars and hemispherical bowls seen in E1
Paso Brown vessel assemblages, indicating that between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1250 a relatively rapid
change in decorative styles occurred with little concomitant change in vesse! form and function.
E1 Paso Bichrome continues to pose problems
for chrono!ogical placement, mostly due to the fact
that very few chronometrically dated pure
bichrome assemblages have been excavated or
reported. Most E1 Paso Bichrome assemblages
have been found in association with late E1 Paso
Brown, Mimbres Black-on-white, and often the
early/transitional variants of E1 Paso Polychrome,
from components dating between ca. A.D. 10001250. A few incidences have been reported of

214

Texas Archeological Society

crudely painted bichrome sherds recovered from
sites or contexts dating as early as A.D. 600-800,
but neither the dating nor the painting have been
conclusively verified.
The few suitable E1 Paso Bichrome collections
that have been studied show close similarities to E1
Paso Brown in terms of overall vessel and rim
forms. The primary difference between the two
types is the addition of red or black-painted designs
on E1 Paso Bichrome. Some have questioned the
existence of the black-on-brown variety. While redon-brown designs are much more common, a few
examples of true black-on-brown are known from
several excavated collections. Designs are simple,
consisting of single or double diagonal lines appended from the rim or a rim band. On larger sherds,
the lines can sometimes be observed to form triangles and chevrons (Figure 28).
E1 Paso Polychrome first appears between A.D.
1000 and A.D. 1100. Early and transitional variants
of E1 Paso Polychrome follow the basic vessel form
trends established in the E1 Paso Brown series, and
the design layouts of E1 Paso Bichrome. Again, the
predominant vessel form is the neckless jar and
hemispherical bowl, although necked jar forms also

Figure 28. Early E1 Paso Polychrome designs on rim
sherds and example of design band layout.

occur for the transitional variant during this period.
Designs on early and transitional E1 Paso
Polychrome are similar to those for E1 Paso
Bichrome, with the addition of both black and redpainted parallel lines. Primary design layouts consist
of diagonal red and black bands appended from the
rim, or a rim band which form combinations of
chevrons and triangles (see Figure 28). The
transitional variant is notable for the first incidence
of stepped fret designs which become common in
later classic variants.
While two variants of El Paso Polychrome
dating before A.D. 1250 have been recognized during recent analyses of several excavated collections, it is not yet possible to determine whether
they represent functional and/or chronological variation or simply minor differences among site assemblages. The two variants are classified on the basis
of a slightly greater proportion of necked jars and
the occurrence of stepped fret design elements on
the transitional variant. However, it is often difficult to distinguish necked and neckless jar forms
using collections of small rim sherds, and stepped
frets are generally rare. Therefore, the two variants
can seldom be discriminated among sherd lots.
By A.D. 1250, there is virtually a complete
replacement of Plain Brown and Bichrome types,
as well as the early/transitional variant of E1 Paso
Polychrome, with Classic E1 Paso Polychrome (Figure 29). This pattern is unique among Southwestern ceramic technologies, since no plain or
corrugated utilitarian wares are produced in combination with the painted E1 Paso Polychrome ceramics. Instead, E1 Paso Polychrome is painted only on
the upper half to two-thirds of the vessel. The lower
portion of the vessel--the area most likely to come
into contact with heating fires--was left undecorated. Therefore, E1 Paso Polychrome served multiple functions as both a utilitarian and
non-utilitarian decorated ware.
Classic E1 Paso Polychrome jar forms include
the characteristic everted rim, restricted orifice
necked jar, or olla. Bowl forms include hemispherical shapes with somewhat larger orifice diameters
and sizes than earlier variants. Some Classic E1
Paso Polychrome jars measure nearly one meter in
height and have orifice diameters of nearly 35 cm,
and represent some of the largest vessels ever produced in the Southwest. Unusual vessel forms include paired jars connected by a "stirrup" handle,
jars with attached base supports, and a highly styl-

protuding from the rim (Figure 30).
Two variants of Classic Et Paso Polychrome
have recently been identifed; they are differentiated
on the basis of subtle differences in wall thickness,
rim form, and design elements. One variant is characterized by relatively thicker walls, and a slightly
outcurved ri~n with a flat or rounded lip. The second variant tends towards thinner vessel walls, a
greater degree of rim eversion and thickening with
a rounded lip, and perhaps a slightly higher incidence of curvilinear design elements. While it would
be tempting to classify these variants as early and
late, analysis of chronometric data has found little
differentiation among the two, and other archeological evidence suggests that they may represent
slight functional differences associated with different settlement types rather than discrete chronological developments.
Unlike other Southwestern decorated ceramic
traditions, painted E1 Paso brownwares have never
developed a reputation for aesthetic achievement in
terms of design elements and layout. It is the
authorâs opinion that the complexity of design
layouts on Classic E1 Paso Polychrome vessels has
been unappreciated, perhaps due in part to the fact
that so few whole vessels are available for study.
Further, design layouts are constructed from a

limited set of elements, consisting primarily of
alternating red and black parallel or interlocking
bands, and stepped frets (Figure 31). Circles, combs,
and crosses are sometimes present as secondary
elements. Morn recent appraisals have observed that
this restricted set of design elements is integrated
into an extremely complex and dynamic series of
band layouts between the rim and lower framing
lines (Miller n.d.; Thomas OâLaughlin, personal
communication, 1994).

While up to this point we have emphasized the
indigenous E1 Paso Brownware tradition, it must
also be noted that a variety of noteworthy ceramics
occur in West Texas, including types such as
Mimbres Black-on-white and Ramos Polychrome,
which rank among the most remarkable of prehistoric North American ceramics. By far, the two
most common non-local ceramic types am Mimbres
Black-on-white and Chupadero Black-on-white.
Mimbres Black-on-white occurs on most
pithouse sites in the area dating prior to A.D. 1150,
usually in association with E1 Paso Brown,
Bichrome, and early/transitional Polychrome variants. Mimbres ceramics are known for their fine
design execution and highly stylized naturalistic
representations of animals and humans. Figure 32
illustrates an example of a partial Mimbres Classic
Black-on-white vessel with a naturalistic design
motif from the North Hills I site (41EP355) in northeast E1 Paso. Chupadero Black-on-white is one of
the most widely distributed ceramics throughout
West Texas and New Mexico. It is also one of the
longest-lived types, with dates reported from ca.
A.D. 1150 to A.D. 1650.
Other important additions to the West Texas
ceramic inventow originated in the Casas Grandes
area of the North Central Mexican state of Chihuahua. Medio and Tardio period ceramics are commonly found in the area at pueblo sites dating
between A.D. 1250 and A.D. 1450. Common types
include the finely made Ramos Polychrome (Figure 33), with fine-line red and black designs and
occasional effigy vessels, and Villa Ahumada Polychrome with relatively thick red and black designs

painted over a chalky white slip. Playas Red is
another common ceramic notable for a wide range
of textured and modeled design elements. Although
considered primarily of Chihuahuan origin, there is
some evidence for local production of Playas Red
variants across the Jornada Mogollon region (Bradley and Hoffer 1985; Creel et al. 1995).
Recent excavations and survey projects have
also documented the presence of earlier Viejo period (ca. A.D. 700-1150) red-on-brown and polychrome types throughout the southern portion of
West Texas. Viejo period ceramics, such as Mata
Polychrome, Anchondo broad-line red-on-brown,
Pilon, Leal, and Fernando narrow-line red-onbrown, and several Convento textured varieties,
have been recorded at pithouse and rockshelter sites.
Locations include several pithouse sites around E1
Paso (Miller 1989), the Rio Grande valley terraces
and Alamo arroyo in the vicinity of Fort Hancock
(Martin 1990; Miller 1992a), near Sierra Blanca
(Skinner et al. 1973, 1974), and at Granado Cave
near Van Horn where a whole Mata Polychrome
vessel was found filled with cotton seeds (Hamilton
n.d.; Mallouf 1985). The presence of these Viejo
period ceramics now suggests a much !onger period of contact between West Texas and Chihuahua
than has previously been considered, and close similarities between the design trends of Viejo period
ceramics and E1 Paso Bichrome and early E1 Paso
Polychrome have been noted (Miller 1991a).
Finally, an assortment of other Mogollon and
Anasazi types occur in West Texas, although these
are much fewer in numbers than the types described
above. White Mountain Redwares from East Central
Arizona, including St. Johnâs, Fourmile, Pinedale,
and Heshotauthla Polychrome, occur at pueblo and
some late pithouse sites. Salado Polychromes (Pinto,

Ana County Airport site west of El Paso.

217

Gila, and Tonto Polychrome) are also sometimes
found at pueblo sites in the region, as are Cibola
whitewares from northern New Mexico and Arizona.
By most accounts, the prehistoric E1 Paso
Brownware ceramic tradition comes to an end with
the abandonment of E1 Paso phase puebloan settlements at A.D. 1450. The following 230 year period
presents a rather blank picture for local ceramic
traditions affiliated with various protohistoric
groups, such as the Manso, Suma, and Jumano,
who from Spanish accounts are known to have occupied the region. Several coarsely finished, sandtempered sherds thought to be of historic origin
were recovered from a possible Manso site (LA
26780) near the Dona Ana County Airport, 16 km
west of E1 Paso (Batcho et al. t984). Occasionally
an odd sherd with a sand temper or an unusual
surface treatment or color has been reported during
survey or testing projects in the Hueco Bolson and
elsewhere in the Trans-Pecos. However, these also
have similarities to prehistoric Western Mogollon
plainwares such as Alma Plain. To date, none of
the unusual Jornada sherds has been conclusively
identified as protohistoric in affiliation.
It is not until the Spanish Colonial/Post-Pueblo
Revolt period after A.D. 1680 that a distinctive
local ceramic tradition can again be recognized in
West Texas. With the establishment of the Socorro
and Ysleta missions by Pueblo Revolt refugees from
North Central New Mexico came a new ceramic
tradition known as Ysleta and Socorro Brownware
(Peterson and Brown 1991). Ceramic production at
Native American settlements affiliated with the missions, such as the Ysleta WIC site (41EP2840),
offers several interesting contrasts to local prehistoric technologies (Miller and OâLeary 1992), including a greater level of standardization in vessel
form, size, and symmetry. Also notable is the combination of the traditional olIa jar form and carinated bowl forms similar to northern New Mexico
Puebloan ceramics with new forms such as candlesticks and platos (flat plate-like vessels) imposed
by Spanish consumers (Figure 34). This tradition
continued until later historic times with the introduction of wheel-thrown commercial ceramic production in the 1800s.
Again, non-!ocal types occur with some frequency, demonstrating participation in regional exchange networks, particularly along the Camino
Real (see Palmer t993). Tewa and Ogapoge
Polychromes and Rio Grande Glazewares from

northern and central New Mexican Pueblos have
been found at several sites in the Rio Grande valley
in the vicinity of E1 Paso (Figure 35). A notable
addition to the ceramic inventory of this period are
the porcelain-like majolica wares produced in
Puebla, Mexico, and transported along the Camino
Real as it passed through E1 Paso del Norte.

Several ethnohistorically documented Spanish
Colonial period groups produced ceramics in the
La Junta District, including several affiliated with
early mission settlements which predate the Pueblo
Revolt occupation of the El Paso area (Kelley 1953,
1986). However, the ceramics of this area have not
yet been fully described (but see Hoyt 1994; Cloud
et al. 1994:86-102). Further reserach should be emphasized in the La Junta District, since here we
have the potential to examine the entire range of
ceramic production from prehistoric to late historic
times in West Texas.

Summary of West Texas Ceramics
Despite more than 40 years of archeological
research and 20 years of intensive cultural resource
management survey and excavation projects, ceramic studies in West Texas are essentially still in

Perttula et al. m Prehistoric Ceramics in Texas

their infancy. While other regions of the Southwest
have moved on to issues of technological production within a wider framework of anthropo!ogica!
theory, ceramicists in West Texas are still wrestling with fundamental issues of typology, chronology, and context. Although these are worthwhile
pursuits, it is perhaps time to broaden our perspectives, theoretical outlooks, and range of analytical
tools (Miller 1991b).
Aside from their utility as relative chronological indicators, and for other traditional research
avenues, more interesting is the potential information afforded by various technological aspects of E1
Paso Brownware production. As several passages
in this section have noted, the E1 Paso Brownware
tradition is one of the more distinctive in the American Southwest, although it is one that is often portrayed in a rather negative manner for, as noted by
Stephen LeBlanc (1982), E1 Paso Polychrome represents "...one of the least aesthetically pleasing
ceramics produced in the southwest." Aside from
the aesthetic critiques, such viewpoints reflect our
perception of the relatively unstandardized and unchanging technology of the region.
Rather than viewing ceramic production solely
in aesthetic and typological terms, it would be more
productive to examine ceramic technology within
the context of the particular settlement and
subsistence systems of the region. Only recently
have we begun to reconsider the functional roles
of ceramic technological variability in the context
of highly mobile, hunter-gatherer settlement
adaptations characteristic of most of West Texas
(Miller 1990, n.d.; Poche 1995; Reed 1991;
Whalen 1994a, 1994b). This will require a
fundamental shift in how we perceive ceramic
production, as well as the development of new
analytical tools and methods.
I see great potential for an expanded
application of geochemical and petrographic
methods for identifying ceramic compositional
groups and how they relate to production zones and
resource locations (Bentley 1994; Burgett n.d.;
Bradley and Hoffer 1985). These data offer several
possibilities, including: refined models of
production, use, exchange, and discard for mobile
hunter-gatherer groups; as well as interactions
between the Mimbres Valley, northern Chihuahua,
the Jornada Mogollon, and the greater Trans-Pecos.
Did E1 Paso Polychrome serve as the "tin can" of
the Southwest as proposed by DiPeso et al. (1974),

serving primarily as a cheap container for the
exchange of goods? Or will more subtle functional
implications be found upon closer examination?
Variations in temper selection and preparation,
vessel wall strength, thermal shock resistance, and
surface treatments may also furnish some insight
into the role of ceramics in an essentially hunting
and gathering economy (Whalen 1994a). How the
role of ceramics changed in the context of later
prehistoric agricultural development may also be
examined, clarifying whether or not the application
of necks to jar forms was a functional result of the
increasing use of ceramics for the preparation of
corn, in turn reflecting greater agricultural
dependence after A.D. 1100 or A.D. 1250 (Seaman
and Mills 1988; Hard et al. 1995). These questions
offer intriguing research results for the future.
Perhaps no other region of Texas, with the
exception of the Caddoan area of Northeast Texas,
offers such potential for ceramic studies.

SUMMARY COMMENTS
This review of the prehistoric and historic
aboriginal ceramics made and used by aboriginal
peoples in Texas barely scratches the surface in
terms of truly characterizing the impressive
stylistic, functional, and technological diversity of
the many ceramic wares found across the state. As
we discussed, ceramics were manufactured in
Texas beginning as early as 500 B.C. in parts of
Northeast Texas, and by A.D. 1200/1300 or so,
ceramics were a very significant part of the
material culture of aboriginal peoples in Southeast
and coastal Texas, among Caddoan and Jornada
Mogollon groups, and among the Plains Village
communities in the Texas Panhandle and the North
Central Texas prairies.
Differences and trends in the use of ceramics
by these aboriginal peoples relate to the most basic
issues of prehistoric and historic Native American
cultural adaptations (see OâBrian et al. t994), not
simply to standard but less-compelling issues of
chronology and cultural-temporal systematics.
Thus, it is high time that Texas archeologists begin
to truly take full advantage of the valuable research
information to be gained by the comprehensive
regional and site-specific study of ceramic style,
function, and technology embedded in the diverse
aboriginal ceramic assemblages found across the

state in archeological contexts. Accordingly, we
hope that this overview will bring renewed
archeological attention to the prehistoric and
historic aboriginal ceramics found in Texas, and
that new methods of study-- and most importantly
new ways of thinking--result in refined
understanding of the role of ceramics in Native
American lifeways.
