Introduction
For the third consecutive year, the 2010
Archaeology Field School, South Texas
(AFSST) season centered on one site,
Fort Lipantitlán (41-NU-54, hereafter
designated NU-54). This important site
contains stratified components dating
from Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and
Spanish/Mexican contact periods (Drolet
2008a, 2009a). The site is located along
the Lower Nueces River near San
Patricio, Texas (Fig. 1). Previous survey
and testing operations by the AFSST has
confirmed this site extends approximately
20 hectares in size and is associated with
dispersed habitation localities (Drolet
2008a, 2009a).
Work this summer continued excavations
in the northwest site portion (River
Area). Two block excavations exposed
habitation localities associated with
prehistoric occupations and an historic
component dating to the late 1700s and
early 1800s. Site NU-54 is the only
known site in the Lower Nueces River
Valley where these distinct cultural
occupations have been clearly isolated
together, offering an opportunity to trace
changes from prehistoric to historic
periods in a single river valley and a
single site in South Texas.
As described in earlier reports, Site NU54, known locally as Fort Lipantitán,

served as both a Spanish/Mexican civil
settlement and military station during the
late 1700s and early 1800s (Drolet 2009a;
Jackson et al. 2006). Our previous
archaeological work over the past three
years has demonstrated that prior to the
establishment of the Fort in the 1830s,
the settlement was a Late Prehistoric base
camp associated with historic contact and
cohabitation (Drolet 2008b, 2008c,
2009b, Drolet and Wright 2010). One of
the two habitation features investigated
this year offers additional evidence
relating to this contact situation.

This report describes student training and
field research during the 2010 Field
School program. Institutional and public
support make this annual program

2

possible. Field operations and research
results are described below.
Participants and Support
The 8-week archaeology field program is
co-sponsored by Texas A&M UniversityCorpus Christi (TAMU-CC), and the
Corpus Christi Museum of Science and
History (CCMSH). The goals of this
program, now in its eleventh year, are to
offer students and the public training in
archaeology field methods and document
the history of human settlement in the
Lower Nueces River Valley. There are
two groups of participants: University
students enroll in the AFSST course
(Anthropology 3390) at TAMU-CC, and
interested youth groups and public sign
up through the CCMSH. All participants
work in teams under the Director and
field supervisors. Everyone is housed at
a local ranch that serves as the field
headquarters.
The University students were from Texas
A&M University-Corpus Christi and
Texas A&M University-College Station.
John Hahn and Rebecca Izen, previous
Field School students, served as Field
Supervisors. Sixty new and returning
volunteers joined the Field School team.
These included middle school and high
school students and adult volunteers.
Among these were forty-four 7th graders
from the Alice ISD Science Camp who
assisted in field and lab operations over a
two day period. They were accompanied
by high school mentors and teachers.
Project Assistance
The Archaeology Field School received
continued support and assistance from
institutions, community organizations,
and individuals.
The sponsoring

institutions, including Texas A&M
Corpus Christi and the Corpus Christi
Museum of Science and History offered
logistical and administrative support.
The Friends of the Corpus Christi
Museum provided equipment, supplies,
and consultant fees for field supervisors.
The Corpus Christi Museum Director,
Rick Stryker, as always provided his
support. The Texas Archeological
Society graciously contributed financial
support for the program.
Support also came from individuals and
organizations. St. Patrick’s Catholic
Church in San Patricio once again
provided the Community Center for
dinner and evening discussions. The
field research team had exclusive use of
Dr. Robert Bluntzer’s ranch in San
Patricio, where the field headquarters,
camp, and laboratory were located. Rick
Kocurek and Peter Tischler offered
access to their ranches for archaeological
research at and around Site NU-54.
Charles Bluntzer, Joan Bluntzer, Cindy
McCown, Della Yunis, Bill Havelka, and
Reverend George Thomas were helpful in
providing logistical and field support, as
well as information about local history.
Finally, Mr. Sanford Amey of Corpus
Christi, kindly donated the use of a 4wd
pick-up truck for the 2010 program.
The community of San Patricio hosted a
public meeting at St. Patrick’s Church
Community Center where Field School
students and staff presented their final
research results (Blue 2010; Cowen
2010; Riewe 2010). The presentation
was attended by approximately 35 people
from the surrounding area.

used
for
staging
logistical
hunting/foraging procurement in the
surrounding Valley areas (Drolet 2008c).
While two of the Late Prehistoric base
camps, SP-220 and NU-301 appear to
have been abandoned in the 1700s, Site
NU-54 shows evidence of continued
occupation and contact in the late 1700s
and early 1800s. NU-54 is the only site
in the Valley with this long, continuous
sequence and the only one identified thus
far that contains information relating to
Late Prehistoric Spanish/Mexican contact
at a Native site in the region (Drolet
2008b, 2009b).

Field Research and Results
The 2010 field season focused on Fort
Lipantitlán, Site NU-54, a habitation site
with both prehistoric and historic
components (Chapman 2008, 2009, 2010;
Drolet 2009b). It represented one of
eleven small hunting camps located in the
northern Nueces Valley during Late
Archaic times. In the latter part of the
Late Prehistoric, after AD 1400, the site
became one of three principal base camps
located along a 14km stretch of the
Nueces River (Fig. 2).
NU-54 is associated with a diversity of
small
satellite
hunting
camps,
procurement stations, and quarries
located 1-3km around the habitation
complex. This pattern is similar to the
other two principal base camp sites, SP220 and NU-301. These three base
camps continued to be principal
habitation areas until the 1700s. They
functioned as settlements for multiple
domestic groups, locations of pottery and
stone tool making, and permanent camps

Fig.3. Site NU-54, Overall site boundaries and principal
occupation areas (a-d). Habitation areas (A1, A2, A6)
discussed in the text are illustrated in the River Area.

In 2010, work at NU-54 focused on two
previously identified habitation localities,
Areas 1 and 2 in the River Area (Fig. 3).
The objectives of intensive excavation at
each locality were to isolate the
prehistoric components, recover artifact
assemblages for laboratory study, and
locate specific habitation features. Block
excavations were designed to provide
both stratigraphic and spatial information
about the Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and
historic site occupations.

4

To further investigate the clustered
relationship within the multiple site
group surrounding NU-54, subsurface
testing was continued at one out-lying
site, NU-333 (Hahn 2010; Figs. 2 and 3).
Previous work in 2009 indicated the site
served as a temporary lithic reduction
station. It measured approximately 1 ha
in size and was located a few hundred
meters north of NU-54, adjacent to a
principal quarry, Site NU-258, located
along the banks of the Nueces River
(Hahn 2008, 2009). A Late Prehistoric
lithic assemblage was recovered in 2009,
primarily containing reduced cores and
prepared bifaces. Toyah phase sherds
and early historic pottery fragments were
associated with the assemblage, clearly
linking the use of this site with the Late
Prehistoric/Historic habitation at NU-54.
Continued testing at this site in 2010 was
designed to obtain more information
about its overall size and to recover a
larger sample of lithic materials relating
to tool manufacturing at NU-54 and chert
cobble procurement at quarry site NU258.
One of the more intriguing issues to
develop in our recent research at NU-54
has been the “historic cohabitation”
argument
expressed
in
recent
professional conference papers (Drolet
2008b, 2009b; Chapman 2010). This
argument is based on archaeological
remains recovered in the upper cultural
component at the site. The component
contains Late Prehistoric Toyah phase
artifacts
mixed
with
Spanish/Mexican/English artifacts dating
from the late 1700s and early 1800s. We
interpreted this component as evidence
for historic contact prior to the
establishment of Fort Lipantitlán in the
1830s. Other archaeologists have

suggested the cultural materials may
represent temporally distinct and
disturbed occupation components, where
mixing of artifacts in these upper levels is
perhaps the result of periodic flooding
and recent land-use disturbance. This
alternative hypothesis challenged us in
the 2010 work to generate more
information that might support or reject
the cohabitation argument. During this
season, the field team continued to
carefully record stratigraphy, plot all
cultural materials, and record minute soil
changes. In addition, floatation and
column samples were collected from the
block excavations for analysis and test
units were excavated outside the
habitation areas to record evidence of
natural soil horizons, flood lenses and
evidence of recent tillage disturbance.
This additional information along with
careful evaluation of excavated cultural
materials has strengthened the Late
Prehistoric
cohabitation
argument
(Chapman 2010, Drolet and Wright 2010,
Inez 2010).
Habitation Area 1 (A1), River Area,
NU-54
This habitation area was identified during
the 2008 surface survey of the site (Fig.
3). It contained Late Prehistoric and
historic artifacts dispersed over an area
approximately 10m by 10m. Testing in
2008-2009 revealed a 20-30cm deep
habitation deposit containing fragmented
faunal bone, pottery, and lithic artifacts
(Drolet 2009a). In 2010, excavations
were extended from the original 20082009 test units to include a 7m long x 3m
wide x 40cm deep block to further
expose the cultural deposit and record
special features within the cultural
component.

deer) was recovered in a section of the
habitation area, possibly used as a grease
production station (Blue 2010). Adjacent
to the concentrated bone, a hearth was
identified with heavy amounts of
charcoal and ash, suggesting the locality
where the faunal bone was burned
(Riewe 2010). Other cultural material
included shell beads, modified shell
remains, fired clay nodules, fish otoliths
and sandstone nodules (Chapman 2010;
Cowen 2010).
Although no house
features, such as a floor, pole
impressions, or stone alignments were
identified, the exposed area was clearly
used for domestic activities by one or
more surrounding households.
The
undisturbed deposit clearly indicates a
contact period habitation.

shows the 7x3m block excavation and students drawing the
north wall stratigraphic profile.

The excavation yielded a rich collection
of cultural material, a hearth, and a bone
bed (Blue 2010; Riewe 2010). The
cultural material consists of mixed Late
Prehistoric
and
historic
artifacts
distributed homogeneously throughout
the 30cm deep deposit. These include
over 350 Native ceramic fragments,
consisting mostly of Leon Plain ware
(Fig. 5). Spanish, Mexican, and English
ceramics were equally numerous,
consisting of over 300 sherds containing
colorfully
decorated
and
glazed
earthernwares.
Glass and metal
fragments, including one glass bead were
also scattered throughout the excavation
area (Drolet and Wright 2010). Toyah
phase lithic artifacts dominated the
deposit, including chert bifaces, cores,
modified flakes, prismatic blades, and
thousands of debitage flake remains
(Izaguierre 2010). Approximately 3000 g
of crush, fragmented, and burnt faunal
bone, mostly large mammal (bison and

Habitation Area 2 (A2), River Area,
NU-54
This habitation area, identified in 2008
by concentrated Late Prehistoric and
historic surface artifacts, revealed more

6

temporal evidence about site habitation in
the River Area. Limited excavations
begun in 2009 (Drolet 2009a) were
expanded in 2010 exposing a 3m long x
4m wide x 1m deep block. Within the
top 20-30cm Late Prehistoric and historic
materials were recovered in sparse
amounts compared to Area 1, located
40m to the west (Fig. 3). However,
beneath this upper cultural layer, an
earlier Archaic habitation component was
identified that measured 40-50cm in
depth (Maeda 2010).

dart point (Fig. 6 a, b, c, e, j). These, the
Matamoros point recovered during the
2010 testing at Area 1 (Fig. 6f), and the
dart points recovered from surface survey
(Fig. 6 g, h, i,) are diagnostic artifacts
commonly found in Middle to Late
Archaic sites in the Valley and the region
(Drolet and Gilmore 2002). In addition
to the projectile points found at Area 2,
cores, bifaces, modified flakes, prismatic
blades, a bifacial gouge, an abrader, an
anvil, and a hammer stone were
recovered in the same 20-60cmbs
Archaic component (Maeda 2010).
Testing conducted in other areas of the
River Area (Drolet 2009) indicate the
Archaic occupation deposit extends from
Area 2 approximately 40m further north
and west across the terrace to Area 6
(A6) (Fig. 3). The component confirms
the earliest NU-54 site habitation, dating
somewhere between 2700 and 1000 years
ago, based on regional dating of the
period and the associated diagnostic
artifacts (Perttula 2004:9).

The lower-level Archaic component
contained diagnostic lithic artifacts and
an abundance of flake debitage. The

Testing at Site NU-333
In addition to the initial post hole test
units excavated at this site in 2009,
tewenty-four more units were completed
in 2010 (Hahn 2009, 2010). The most
recent work recovered Late Prehistoric
lithic and ceramic material similar to the
2009 assemblage (Drolet 2009:6). The
bulk of the recovered material comes
from a buried cultural deposit located 1040cmbs and spread over an area
measuring approximately 100m long by
30m wide. The 2010 lithic artifacts
included 1 Perdiz point, 1 knife, and 1
biface along with several plain Toyah
pottery sherds and moderate densities of
chert flakes, faunal bone fragments, firecracked rock and clay nodules. The
small size of the site along with the

7

abundance of lithic material indicate that
the locality fronting the Nueces River
was a procurement/reduction station used
by groups from NU-54 in Late
Prehistoric times. During this period,
base camp settlements like NU-54,
typically contained multiple small
hunting camps, lithic reduction stations,
and quarry sites where resources were
procured, modified, and carried back to
the base camp for use or consumption.
Discussion
Site NU-54 is providing new information
about the prehistory of the Lower Nueces
River Valley and the broader South
Texas region.
The settlement is
associated with a long hunter/gatherer
tradition that developed over several
millennia. It is the only habitation site in
the Lower Nueces Valley where an
approximate
2700-year
continuous
occupation has been documented. The
archaeological sequence at the site
extends over two prehistoric periods and
continues until early 19th century historic
times.
The earliest inhabitants at the site were
Archaic groups that probably seasonally
lived here. Habitation Areas 2 and 6
contain remains of this earliest
occupation, associated with Tortugas,
Catan, and Matamoros projectile points,
diagnostic of Middle and Late Archaic
periods. During Late Prehistoric times
the settlement grew in size and was
associated with multiple habitation areas
containing pottery and lithic tool
assemblages. Common artifacts during
this period included Toyah pottery
fragments, Perdiz arrow points, and
diverse unifacial tools, including
modified flakes and prismatic blades.
Site NU-54 represented one of three
major Late Prehistoric base camps in the

Lower Nueces Valley at this time. Like
the others, the settlement became
permanent and utilized the surrounding
prairie lands and flood plains as a
territorial location for hunting, gathering,
and procuring raw materials.
At the terminal portion of the Late
Prehistoric, rapid changes began to affect
NU-54 and other nearby base camps.
Habitation Area 1 at NU-54 contains
clear evidence of culture contact with
Spanish/Mexican groups. Diverse glazed
pottery types, including Mayolicas,
Galera Ware, crockery, and even fancy
English whitewares suddenly appear and
are mixed with native Toyah pottery.
The glazed ceramics can be dated to this
period and are identical to historic wares
imported into the nearby Spanish
Missions at Goliad at this time (Fox and
Ulrich 2008).

Fig. 7. Mexican Galera Ware recovered from Habitation Area
1, NU-54.

Formal analysis of the Toyah ceramic
remains from Area 1 indicate this contact
situation may have endured for several
decades and influenced change in native
pottery manufacture at the site. The
native ceramics from Area 2 correspond
to Toyah ware, typically consisting of
plain, undecorated, bone-tempered bowls
and jars commonly associated with Late
Prehistoric sites in South Texas (Johnson
1994; Fig. 5). However, the fragmentary

8

but sizable collection from Area 1 shows
new features (Drolet and Wright 2010).
The sherds contain gravel temper instead
of the traditional bone temper, indicating
a major manufacturing change. Several
sherds have bright red slips and two even
have clear glazes representing new
decorative elements on the native wares.
These innovations may have been
attempts by local Toyah potters at
copying the colorful and better made
Spanish/Mexican/English ceramic style
vessels circulating in habitation areas of
NU-54. In addition, black designs were
being applied on some Toyah pots using
asphaltum, a decorative technique more
commonly associated with Rockport
phase pottery from the neighboring
central Texas coast.
Were the historic changes at NU-54
during the end of the Late Prehistoric due
to the movement of artifacts or people or
both? From the late 1700s to the early
1800s, was the Late Prehistoric base
camp at NU-54 being transformed into a
Spanish/Mexican hamlet through contact,
trade, and cohabitation? Does the
borrowing of asphaltum painting
techniques by local, Late Prehistoric
Toyah potters at NU-54 indicate that
trade and technology transfer operated
between Native groups of the coast and
inland areas during the same Spanish
contact period? These are intriguing
questions that could help direct future
research about historic contact at Native
settlements in South Texas and help
explain how this contact influenced
cultural change, alliances, and trade.
Given the information being generated at
NU-54, this is one of the only known
sites in South Texas where answers to
these questions can be answered.

Final Comments
Archaeology field schools are designed
to train students in methods and
techniques of data recovery, laboratory
analysis, and artifact conservation. The
Archaeological Field School, South
Texas has successfully done this for the
past eleven years. It has also provided an
opportunity for public volunteers to learn
about how archaeological research is
conducted. In the San Patricio county
area, local support of this program has
resulted in land owners and community
people protecting archaeological and
historical sites on their property.

School Headquarters, San Patricio, Texas.

Another important component in field
school training has been teaching
students how to prepare field reports and
present professional conference papers.
The final Field School papers and oral
presentations benefit the students
academically. This year, as in previous
ones, the Field School students modified
their field reports into conference papers
and presented these at a special
Symposium of the Texas Archeological
Society (TAS) Meetings held at Corpus
Christi in October 2010. The papers
focused on data recovered from NU-54
and NU-333.
Topics ranged from
habitation feature identification (Riewe
2010), faunal analysis (Blue 2010),
stratigraphy (Izen 2010), lithic tool

9

assemblages (Chapman 2010; Hahn
2010, Yzaguirre 2010), and pottery types
(Drolet and Wright 2010). The papers
included interpretive sections about how
these topics relate to Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and historic occupations at
NU-54. Several of the students received
scholarship awards from TAS for
attending and presenting at the
conference.
