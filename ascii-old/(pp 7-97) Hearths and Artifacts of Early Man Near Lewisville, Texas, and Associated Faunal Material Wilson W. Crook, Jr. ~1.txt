Note: The names of many authors should head this paper, as it represents
a compendium of the work and efforts of many different persons and institutions. Without any one of these valuable contributions, much vital
information and many interpretations would have been neglected. If the
list of acknowledgements appears long, so also is the list of important
contributors. The effort and detail expended may appear excessive in view
of the small number of artifacts actually recovered, but in the case of the
Lewisville site it is the supplementary material and its description and
evaluation that is of paramount importance. This is the first Clovis camping
station to be discovered; it is the first Clovi3 site down off the Plains, in
place, in a recognized river terrace formation; it has produced perhaps the
most extensive faunal association for Early Man in America to date; and
it has provided the first material of Clovis age and provenience for radiocarbon dating. As to the sequence of the writers’ names, this is purely
alphabetical. No junior or senior authorship is implied, the writers working
as full and equal partners in the project. W.W.C., Jr. & R.K.H.

INTRODUCTION AND HISTORY
The Lewisville site, an Early Man camp site consisting of 21
hearths with associated artifacts and faunal remains, was discovered and partially excavated near Lewisville, Denton County,
Texas, between the years 1951 and 1957. The site lay in an alluvial terrace 70 feet above the Elm Fork of the Trinity River.
It was exposed by the excavation of a huge borrow pit for fill
in construction of the Lewisville Dam, an operation which removed more than 20 feet of overburden from the terrace. Evidence of occupation by Early Man occurred in the verst bottom
of this pit.
This terrace has been geologically correlated with an interstadial or interglacial period of the Late Pleistocene, possibly
within, or just preceding, the Wisconsin stage, depending upon
the eventual definition and evaluation of this stage. Extinct

faunal-remains of this general age have been identified from
the site.
A Clovis-type projectile point was recovered actually in place
in one of the hearths, apparently identifying the occupation.
Charred vegetable material in close association with the Clovis
point in one hearth, and wood charcoal from another hearth at
the same geo!ogic level, have provided two separate radiocarbon
datings. These dates are in agreement in being beyond the effective range of the carbon dioxide type counters, expressed as
being "more than 37,000 years old."
In addition, six other artifacts were recovered from the site,
plus a very extensive faunal collection. Most of the faunal remains were found actually burned within the hearths; others
were closely adjacent on the same buried surfaces. The probability is that all of them were food items of the occupation;
but whether this is so or not, all were certainly geologically
contemporaneous with Early Man at Lewisville. It is particularly of note that the terrace, and within the terrace the specific sub-formation in which the site occurs, are identical with
the terrace and sub-formation which yielded the partial skeleton of the Lagow Sand Pit Man of 1921, some 25 miles downstream on the Trinity River at Dallas. Other evidences of human occupation in this same geological stratum are also known
from the immediate area and stream system.
Theodore E. White, then of the River Basin Surveys and
now with the National Park Service at Dinosaur National
Monument, Jensen, Utah, is the original discoverer of the site.
As paleontologist doing salvage work during construction of the
Garza-Little Elm Reservoir (which is impounded by the Lewisville Dam), he located the site and excavated it as a bone
quarry. Attracted by what appeared to be burned areas in the
vicinity, White tested one such "hearth" in company with Glen
L. Evans, then geologist with Texas Memorial Museum, and
Edward B. Jelks of the River Basin Surveys archeological project at the reservoir (Stephenson, 1949). This was in late 1951,
and according to a personal communication from White, the
test produced burned deer bones, a horse vertebra, packrat
bones, and charred hackberry seeds. Here was evidence that

rather strongly pointed to the occurence of man at the site in
Pleistocene times.
White and ;[elks introduced the writers to the site in hopes
that local archeologists would maintain vigil and perhaps develop the tantalizing possibilities of the locality.
This was done, and thanks to the rapid erosion of the pit
walls and floor by the rains of the following five years, the discoveries described in this report were made. As a matter of
fact, enough evidence of the probable presence of Early Man
had accumulated by the Fall of 1952 for the annual meeting of
the Texas Archeological Society, held that year at Southern
Methodist University in Dallas, to be led on a field trip to the
site.
But it was in late February, 1956, that rains finally revealed a
large hearththe existence of which had previously been unsuspected with typical burned bone fragments upon its surface. This hearth is identified as "Hearth 1" in ensuing sections
of this report. In early March, Alex D. Krieger, then research
archeologist for the University of Texas and currently Director
of the Riverside Municipal Museum in California, visited the
site by invitation and confirmed the fact that the hearths unquestionably appeared to be of human origin. Krieger also made
specific suggestions for systematic excavations to prove the
hearth occurrences.
As a result, a "group dig" by the Dallas Archeological Society
was scheduled for the weekend of March 25-26. Clearing of the
dig-site and testing on March 22, in preparation for staking
out five-foot squares and a cross-section trench of Hearth 1,
resulted in the exciting discovery of a Clovis point in situ in
the upper zone of the red-burned hearth area, plus a "pocket"
of dark-black burned material, at first thought to be a segment
of charred log, some three inches in diameter and seven inches
long, only 20 inches from the point, in the same red-burned
hearth clay. This carbon sample eventually produced the first
of the radiocarbon dates for the site and was identified as
being "fibrous vegetable material," rather than wood charcoal
as originally thought. The writers, with Mrs. R. K. Harris,
made this initial discovery.

Texas Archeological Society

Telegrams were sent to all archeologists within 500 miles
of the site, inviting participation in the weekend "dig" which
now appeared so promising. Only Sack T. Hughes, Curator of
Archeology at the Panhandle-Plains Museum, Canyon, Texas,
was able to join the weekend project, especially contributing
to the excavation and the jacketing of a humerus of Camelops.
Members of the Dallas Society, besides the writers, who assisted
in this and subsequent excavations, are: Joan Ablon; Herschel
N. Cobb and Mrs. Cobb; Lloyd Harper and Mrs. Harper;
Henry Hanna; Linda Harris; Robert C. Hatzenbuhler and Mrs.
Hatzenbuhler; J. B. Merritt; John Perkins and Mrs. Perkins;
E. J. Ruhland; J. B. Sollberger; Lester Wilson and Mrs. Wilson.
In addition, Richard E. Johnson, President of the Tarrant
County Archeological Society, aided in the first and ensuing
excavations. Almost the entire membership of the Tarrant
Society, including Mr. and Mrs. Tom Dawson, R. E. Forrester,
Mr. and Mrs. John J. Henlein, and Mr. and Mrs. C. W. Worthington, joined the later excavations of Hearths 14, 15, and 16.
Parker Willingham of Denton, Texas, was another steady digger and, especially, an important contributor to the faunal collections.
Professiona! visitors, in addition to Krieger and Hughes, included E. H. Sellards, Director of the Texas Memorial Museum;
F. W. Miller, Curator of the Dallas Museum of Natural History; E. S. Barghoorn of Harvard University and paleobotanical consultant to Humble Oil & Refining Co. ; Weldon Whitaker
of Humble’s Houston Research Center, who so painstakingly
prepared the radiocarbon samples; Charley Steen of the National Park Service, Santa Fe, New Mexico; and J. L. Mahon,
Secretary of the Alabama Archeological Society.
Special thanks are due to the Humble Co. for the services
of their radiocarbon laboratory in determining dates; this
dating was under the personal direction of H. N. Fisk, C. R.
Hocutt, H. Dayton Wilde, and Milton Williams.
Morris F. Skinner of the Frick Laboratory, American Museum of Natural History, New York, is mainly responsible for
the vertebrate identifications. Fred W. Wendorf, then of the

Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe and now with Texas
Technological College in Lubbock, Texas, arranged these identifications.
Thomas M. Oelrich and Claude W. Hibbard of the University
of Michigan have provided the definitive identifications of the
land turtle fauna and many of the smaller mammals.
Elmer P. Cheatum of Southern Methodist University, in collaboration with Henry van der Shalie of the University of
Michigan, has handled the identification of the invertebrates.

The U. S. Corps of Engineers, in the person of Ray H. Runder, head of the Fort Worth District, furnished permission to
excavate and provided an invaluable contour map of the site
vicinity. Hence Griffith, commercial photographer and amateur
acheologist, is mainly responsible for the photographic record.
Some excavation photos are by the writers, Cobb, and Johnson.
Mrs. Forrest Kirkland furnished the drawings in Fig. 4.
It had been intended that all of the hearths would be exca~
vated before the time the site was due to be inundated by the
Garza-Little Elm Reservoir. However, Nature planned otherwise. The unprecedented rains of March, April, and May, 1957,
caused a 70-foot rise in the level of the reservoir, filling it to
capacity in a few weeks’ time. A number of unexcavated hearths
were lost to the lake as a result. The site will remain under 15
feet of water even at conservation pool level. The Lewisville
site has thus been destroyed.
The location of the site is shown in Fig. 1.
SUMMARY OF HEARTHS
AND RELATED FAUNAL FINDS
Twenty-one red-burned clay hearths in the form of oval,
shallow, basin-shaped fire-pits constituted the main occupational features at the Lewisville site. Associated with them
were seven artifacts, which are described in the next section,
and a great variety of fossil bones. The general circumstances
of the hearths and paleontological finds are summarized in the
present section. More detailed descriptions are presented in
later sections of the report.
The hearths occurred on the surface of four of the seven
superimposed depositional strata, called "layers" in this report,
which make up the Upper Shule~ formation, as discussed in a
later section. The general stratigraphic situation is shown in
Fig. 2. Three hearths occurred on the surface of the lowest
layer, Layer 1; 13 occurred on the Layer 2 surface; one was on
the Layer 3 surface; and four were on the Layer 5 surface.
All the hearths appear to have been shallow basins scooped
out, burned, and filled with refuse and later flooding sediments.

The average size of the great majority is about 30 inches in
diameter, and they are definitely fire-burned to a depth of between eight and 12 inches. Hearth 1, an exception, measured
some eight feet by 10 feet, and was burned to a depth of 18
inches; this must represent a major bonfire site, repeatedly
re-used. Hearth 4 seems to represent a series of three successive fire-pits dug at approximately, but not quite exactly, the
same location; its combined area is some four feet in diameter,
and the maximum depth of the several pits is more than 30
inches of fire-burned clay. It may be instructive that the use
of snails and hackberry seeds--undoubtedly marginal fare--is
least pronounced in the larger hearths, and heaviest in the
smaller fire pits. In general, the frequency of remains of large
game animals is the opposite of this pattern, favoring the
larger hearths.
Paleontological remains weathered out from the same surfaces
as the hearths, so closely adjacent to the hearths that there can
be little doubt they represent camp refuse connected with the
use of the fire-pits. As with the hearths, the great majority
derived from the old Layer 2 surface. It is highly significant

that while the borrow pit for the dam fill extends nearly half
a mile in length, exposing the same geologic strata throughout,
fossil bones were almost exclusively concentrated in the hearth
area at the east end; here, bone scrap littered the gullies and
surfaces.

Two specimens of mammoth bone came from opposite ends of
the occupation area--a femur head from the west end at Layer
2, and an immature tusk from the east end at Layer 1.
White’s excavated bison skull, with four cervical vertebrae,
came from Layer 2 between Hearth 8 and Hearth 13, in what
later turned out to be an interesting grouping. A large camel
skull was later discovered by the writers only 15 feet northeast of the bison. This specimen was photographed and viewed
in place by Krieger, Hughes, and many other visitors to the
site, but was destroyed by looters before it could be jacketed
and removed. Ten feet due east of White’s bison, later erosion
also exposed large deer antler fragments which were recovered.
Thus, within a restricted area, head fragments of three large
game animals occurred, without any sign of other skeletal parts
of the bodies.
Only 20 feet northeast of Hearth 8, a perfectly preserved
coyote jaw also occurred. Again no bones below the neck have
been found. As with the other instances, and Hearths 8 and 13,
this was from the Layer 2 surface.
Bones of horse, one of the more common animals represented,
were found at various spots over the site. White reported a
horse jaw, presumably from Layer 2, in what is now the general
site area. The writers recovered the following: a partial jaw,
with three teeth, of a large horse some 100 feet northwest of
Hearth 1 on Layer 2; two horse vertebrae at Layer 2, 40 feet
north-northeast of Hearth 1; a distal end of a medium-sized
horse metapodial, broken off for marrow almost identically to
the one in Hearth 1 but in this case unburned, also some 40
feet north-northeast of Hearth 1; and a horse vertebra from
Layer 1 some 30 feet west of Hearth 2 in the deep gully. Ran-

dom horse teeth, from the Layer 5 level, have been found in the
vicinity of Hearths 11 and 12.
Approximately 50 feet due east of Hearth 1 on the Layer 2
surface, 40 feet east of Hearth 7 and some 30 feet west of
Hearth 6, the remains of a semi-articulated fore-limb of an
immature camel were excavated and preserved.
Fragments of bison teeth were recovered from 30 feet southwest of Hearth 1, and from 40 feet due west of Hearth 1, both
on the Layey 2 surface.
White recorded bony scutes of glyptodon from the general
Layer 2 smfface of the site; these are now in the custody of the
U. S. National Museum, and the writers did not match the discovery in their collections.
An area badly dissected by shallow gullies came to be named
"Rodent Hollow" by the writers during their early years of collecting at Lewisville, due to the large numbers of fossil bones
recovered regularly there, mainly of rodents. Subsequent excavations revealed the source of these finds five hearths, Nos.
4, 14, 15, 16 and 17 all at the Layer 2 surface in the immediate
area.
From a 50-foot-square zone, encompassing all five hearths
and all paleontological finds at "Rodent Hollow," came the following assemblage: lower canine of bear; teeth of peccary;
jaw of a small deer; hoof of fore-foot of medium-sized deer;
semi-articulated hind-limb of small-sized deer; lower molar and
jaw fragment of skunk; burned jaw-tooth of raccoon; four jaws
and assorted limb bones, scapula, and pelvis of rabbits; live
jaws and one maxilla of prairie dog; occipital portion of rat
skull; limb bone of mole. In addition, a quartzite chopper (described in the next section) occurred only five feet from the bear
canine mentioned above.
Bones of rabbit and prairie dog occurred generally throughout the site. In addition to the specimens already enumerated
in and adjacent to hearths, seven additional rabbit jaws and
two prairie dog jaws were recovered, all from the Layer 2 surface.

Terrapin and tortoise remains were undoubtedly the most
common vertebrate fossils at the site, in or out of the hearths.
Their occurrence was so common that no accurate record was
maintained. Specimens were donated to visitors and to Boy
Scout groups as mementoes; others were submitted for chemical testing, such as by the nascent uranium daughter products
age determination method. Without exaggeration, it is safe to
say that these were the most numerous fossils in every 10-foot
square of the general hearth area, at every layer level. The
writers conservatively estimate that such land turtle remains,
outside of the recorded hearth occurrences, must have represented no less than 20 individuals. Again, these were most common at Layer 2 (the layer most widely exposed, both by excavation and erosion, at the site), but were also plentiful at
Layers 1, 3, 4, and 5 as well.
Outside of the hearths, the most noteworthy land turtle occurrences include: (1) a carapace fragment (Layer 2) of a
giant Testudo species; (2) White’s report of "a large Gopherus
type land turtle (Layer 2?); (3) a. well-preserved "nesting"
of carapace, plastron, and limb bones of Terrapene canaliculata
of very large size (Layer 3). This last example of T. canaIiculata is most interesting in that its structural detail differs
imperceptibly from that of the living T. carolina, except that
the Lewisville specimen is some 21/2 times the size of any existing example. On the basis of the sample identifications submitted of the turtle material, the writers estimate that at least
90% of the fossil turtles at Lewisville belong to the extinct
Terrapene group, while only about 10~~ pertain to the extinct
Testudo family. None belong to living species in the region.
A description of the very large example of T. canaliculata is
worthwhile, since it rather definitely suggests the presence of
man at the Layer 3 surface, stratigraphically between the
Layer 2 and Layer 5 hearths. As found, the specimen was
"nested" with the two parts of the plastron at the bottom; the
posterior plate of the plastron was inverted, with the humerus
cemented to the ventral side, although this side was found facing
upwards. The essentially complete carapace was immediately
above the plastron, also inverted, but with another of the limb

18

bones cemented by caliche to its under side in this case the
original dorsal surface of the carapace. No flood or work of
nature can have affected such a "nesting" of the parts of a
single individual. The evidence strongly suggests the work of
man at a terrapin "lunch," with the cleaned and discarded hard
parts neatly stacked to one side, perhaps in a shallow gully of
the time.
Just two feet south of Hearth 13 on the Layer 2 surface,
tome 40 vertebrae of a Colubrid snake were recovered. These
belong to the posterior half of a small snake, and may wel!
have been associated with the food activities cf Hearth 13.
Previously, a geology student from Southern Metho:~ist University recovered the skull and anterior portion of a small
grass snake from the general hearth area. The latter occurrence is considered to be derived from the Layer 2 surface.
No fragments of mussel shell or eviden2es of hackberry seeds
were recovered or observed outside of the hearths. This is interpreted as testimony that their occurrences were undoubtedly the result of importation by man.
DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTIFACTS
Despite the numerous evidences of human occupation at the
Lewisville site, the actual number of artifacts found is relatively limited. Their detailed description is warranted in order
that they may be compared with previous Early Man assemblages and with possible future discoveries.
Foremost among the artifact assemblage is of course, the
Clovis projectile point. In addition, a flake scraper, a chopper,
a hammer stone, and three flakes, complete the collection. These
are illustrated in Fig. 4, all actual size.
The Clovis point (Figs. 4,A,B; 6,A,B) was found in Hearth
1. It was some four inches beneath the red-burned clay surface
of the hearth, and 13 inches inside the north edge of the burned
area. Some 20 inches due south, with its top at the same level as
the point, was the pocket of charred vegetable material which
yielded the first C-14 date for the site. The point lay flat in a
horizontal plane, with the partially-fluted side down. A block

of the hearth clay was removed, treated, and jacketed in Plaster
of Paris, preserving intact the projectile point impression.
Upon this block the point is now displayed in its original finding situation.
Of an opaque white flint, the Clovis point measures 82 mm.
in length, despite obvious previous shattering and repointing
on the tip end; width measures 33 mm. ; thickness at mid-point
8.5 mm. This compares very favorably with the dimensions of
the published illustrations of all other excavated Clovis4aoints.
As recorded, published illustrations for 20 Clovis points found
at Angus, Dent, Miami, Clovis, McLean, and Naco, average
83.7 mm. long and 26.8 ram. wide; the range of variation is
116-36 mm. in length, and 33-16 mm. in width (Cotter, 1938;
Bryan and Ray, 1940; Wormington, 1949; Sellards, 1952;
Haury et al., 1953). Thus the Lewisville specimen is seen to
fall well within the range of variation; slightly less than the
average length, and above the average width. Because the tip
has been shattered and repointed, the point’s original length
can be construed to have been well beyond the average of all
illustrated Clovis points, although probably still within the range.
The width, as already noted, is above average, but within the
range. Hence the Lewisville specimen can be interpreted as
being, and having been originally, a large Clovis point.
The thickness of the mid-section, 8.5 mm., compares with an
average of the known determinable specimens--six of the 20
points illustratedof 7.8 mm. Again, the Lewisville specimen
appears large, though within the 5-10 mm. range of previously
described points.
There is a flute 29 mm. long on the partially-fluted under side
(as the point lay when found), and a broken, half-flute, of 32
mm. on the upper side. From observation it is suggested that
fluting was attempted on the upper side, but faulty fracture to
the right prevented a true flute and a second attempt was tried,
resulting in a hinge fracture which produced only a distinctly
thinned base some 9 ram. long and 14 mm. wide, superimposed
upon the earlier attempt. Ground edges are present across the
base and 40 mm. up one side, 32 mm. up the opposite side.

A thin coat of caliche encrustation covered the point, particularly on the under side as found. This has since been removed, after observation and recording, by cleaning solutiom~.
The flake scraper is fashioned from a broken flake of opaque
white flint, distinctly retouched with pressure-flaked bewds
on both side edges (Fig. 4,E). This artifact was found some 50
feet northwest of Hearth 1 in a shallow, eight-inch erosion
gully, at the same level as Hearth 1.
A crude chopper (Fig. 4, F, G) made from a quartzite cobble
with its lower end crudely flaked into a cutting bit and the
upper, nodular, crust preserved for a hand-hold, was excavated
as found freshly eroding in a six-inch gully some 80 feet northeast of Hearth 1, and only 15 feet from the four hearths excavated in "Rodent Hollow" at the site. Of gray quartzite, the
original nodule undoubtedly originated in a cobble field exposed
a half mile west of the site at an altitude of more than 5,30
feet, a remnant of the badly eroded T-5 (Buckner Ho~eHackberry Creek) terrace of much earlier date. This field is
also probably the source of at least two of the flakes found in
the site.
Heavily battered at both ends, the crystalline quartzite cobble (Fig. 4, D) constitutes the hammer stone found freshly
eroded in a 12-inch gully just 10 feet south of White’s bison
excavation. Its source is likewise very probably the cobble field
described above.
Three flakes complete the artifact assemblage. One, of opaque
white flint, occurred on the eroded surface just 15 feet southwest of Hearth 1. The other two, of quartzite, occurred upon the
eroded surface between Hearth 1 and the horse teeth to the
northwest. All artifacts described appear to be derived from
the common, most popular, Layer 2 former surface of the site.
EXCAVATIONS OF THE HEARTHS
Controlled excavations at the Lewisville site were somewhat
limited in extent and were mostly of a salvage nature, due to
a number of factors. Therefore it was most fortunate that the
amount and specific nature of the finds recovered were so in-

22

Texas Archeological Society

formative. Before describing the hearths, we will review the
factors affecting the investigations.
To begin with, the massive excavation for dam fill material
removed a tremendous overburden to expose the site; that this
excavation stopped just about at the level of the most intensely
occupied former surface, was pure luck. The pronounced erosion
since that excavation, resulting in both sheet-wash and strong
gully erosion, further exposed the site materials and reduced the
necessity o3 heavy archeological digging.
Secondly, the hearths, animal bones, and artifacts were very
slowly and progressively revealed over a six-year period of
erosion, and for the first five years of this time the presence
of Early Man was considered to be only a possibility, though
highly likely. As a result there was no incentive to devote any
intensive effort at the site until evidences of human occupation,
at an obviously early geologic level, became positive.
In addition, at the time of the conclusive discoveries, the
River Basin Surveys work in the reservoir area had long since
been completed, and only local money and labor furnished by
the Dallas Archeological Society, the neighboring Tarrant
County Archeological Society, and interested friends and
visitors, were available. This situation caused a concentration
of effort at only the most promising localities in the general
site area.
Finally, geologic studies revealed that the Lewisville occupation successively utilized the series of layer surfaces in the
Upper Shuler formation as it was progressively deposited, and
excavations and testing showed that all finds were essentially
confined to the immediate, local, layer surface adjacent to each
hearth or other paleontological-archeological find. Thus, deep
excavations were not justified; if a promising find warranted
excavation, once the layer surface of its location was laid l~are
no digging was found to be productive more than a foot or so
beneath this surface, unless it involved the excavation of an
actual hearth pit. All materials found were closely associated
with the layer surface upon which they were deposited.
Thus, due to the scanty remains of an apparently ephemeral,

seasonal, sporadic occupation over a continuing period, there
was no appreciable depth to any feature of the site such as is
found in true midden accumulations of later date. Nevertheless,
were it not for the dam excavations, the site would have been
a very deeply buried one, requiring very extensive and expensive digging.
White’s hearth. (Test excavation described in personal communication.) This hearth is presumed, in the light of more recent work and stratigraphic knowledge, to have been at the
Layer 2 surface. It was in the general vicinity of White’s bison
excavation. Associated with the hearth were found a charred
vertebra of horse, burned deer bones, burned packrat bones, and
charred hackberry seeds. Apparently this was one of the typical
small hearths so often encountered in the writers’ excavations
described below.
Hearth 1. Lying at the surface of Layer 2, this was the largest
and most promising of all man-made features found at the site.
After Krieger’s personal inspection and his verdict that the
hearth seemed unquestionably to be of human origin, the most
elaborate excavation plans commensurate with the abilities of
the Dallas Archeological Society were initiated. When preliminary testing on March 22, 1956, revealed the pocket of "charcoal" (later Barghoorn’s "fibrous vegetable material" which
provided the first C-14 date of "more than 37,000 years") and
the Clovis projectile point, a weekend "group dig" of the entire
Society was arranged for March 24-25, 1956 (Fig. 6, A, B, D,

(Fig. 5). Following Krieger’s suggestions, a trench two feet
deep was cut first, exposing a cross-section of the hearth. Thereafter, the individual five-foot squares were excavated by handtrowel in two-inch levels, the contents of each level being collected in a paper bag labeled by square and level. Extensive
plotting and photography of each discovery in place accompanied the record of digging. When it became apparent that the
non-red-burned area outside the actual hearth was almost completely sterile some six inches below the surface of Layer 2,
excavation was carried deeper only within the red-burned
hearth itself, to its base.
Thus the records show that Square 13 includes mostly the
hearth area, with both the Clovis point and the material which
provided the first C-14 date. Square 12 is at least two-thirds
within the hearth area. Squares 17 and 18 include about onethird each of the hearth ; and Squares 7, 8, and 14 include minor
portions of the productive hearth itself. In all, excavations at
Hearth 1 covered some 300 square feet of surface around the
hearth (Squares 1 through 5, 6, 10, 11, and 21 through 25 were
left unexcavated). Nothing of significance was found more than
six inches below the original Layer 2 surface, although the redburned clay of the hearth area extended to 18 inches below that
surface.
The cross-section trench had its vertical east face along the
west borders of Squares 11 through 15. This north-south line
of stakes was laid out by compass, transecting the west onethird of the hearth. As can be observed in Fig. 5, C, the hearth
profile displayed a large, roughly basin-shaped, fire pit. Maximum depth of the hard, red-burned clay was 18 inches below
the Layer 2 surface; this varied along the cross-section exposure. At both the north and south edges of the pit, the bottom
of the basin rose rather abruptly to the Layer 2 surface, suggesting that the hearth was intentionally dug rather than occupying a chance depression. In common with all other hearths
excavated at this site, no evidence of burned root holes or other
indications of a possible burned tree stump were observed; as
seen in the trench wall, the hearth was an eight-foot-long basin.
What appeared to be the caliche-filled hole of a subsequent ver-

tical root or crayfish penetration of the hearth from a higher
level occurred at the south end of the cross-section trench.
Recorded finds from the excavation of Hearth 1 and their
respective proveniences are:
Square 7. A long, narrow extension of red-burned clay extended from the central hearth area into this square, appearing
to be the result of a fire log laid into the hearth and burning
back eventually beyond the confines of the actual hearth. A piece
of burned sandstone at a depth of three inches below the former
Layer 2 surface, and a small piece of unidentifiable burned bone
at four inches, were the only finds.
Square 8. Only a small corner of the hearth area was included
in this square. Two fragments of burned terrapin carapace, presumably T. canaliculata to judge from their thickness and size,
were found three inches below the Layer 2 surface.
Square 12. Approximately two-thirds of this square was prime
hearth area. This area probably included the zone of maximum
fire heat of the hearth, as a medium-sized ash bed and two areas
of exceptionally hard-burned red hearth clay were encountered.
Inside the red-burned zone, a fragment of burned terrapin
carapace (T. canaliculata?) occurred three inches below the
Layer 2 surface; charred hackberry seeds were found at a depth
of four inches; and an unburned terrapin carapace fragment
occurred three inches deep outside of the hearth area.
Square 13. All but a few square inches of the northeast corner
of this square was hearth area. The charred, fibrous vegetable
material for the first C-14 date came from a "pocket" in the
southwest quarter, extending at an angle from near the Layer 2
surface to a depth of some five inches in the red-burned hearth
clay. The Clovis projectile point lay in the northwest quarter at
a depth of four inches. Other materials and objects encountered
in this square, and their depths, are as follows: prairie dog jaw,
three inches; split and burned bones of deer, two to three
inches; burned terrapin carapace fragments, two to three inches;
split and burned bones of deer, four inches; burned and broken
distal end of horse metapodial, four inches; burned leg bones

of small bird, four inches; burned wolf claw, four inches; and
burned fragments of terrapin carapace, four inches.
Square 14. Only the edge of the hearth area was included in
this square. Finds included only several fragments of burned
terrapin carapace at depths of from two to four inches.
Square 17. The edge of the hearth extended only into the
northeast corner of this square. Materials found were: burned
fragments of terrapin carapace, three inches deep; burned leg
bones of small bird, three inches deep; and a small piece of
unburned sandstone, four inches deep.
Square 18. An edge of the hearth area extended into the
southeast corner of this square. Several fragments of burned
terrapin carapace occurred at a depth of three inches; one small
mussel shell (Fusconaia cf. undata [Barnes] ), heavily burned,
was three inches deep; and what was apparently the matching
mussel shell also occurred at a three-inch depth, but unburned
and outside the hearth.
Numerous caliche-filled crotovinas and root-fillings were observed and plotted, but no post-holes or other recognizable manmade features were recognized. No artifacts other than the
Clovis point were recovered from Hearth 1, but a flint flake was
found on the eroded Layer 2 surface only 15 feet southwest of
Square 21.
Hearth 2. Exposed at the base of a gully, 36 inches below the
level of Hearth 1 and at the former Layer 1 surface, Hearth 2
was a small, basin-shaped, hearth pit which measured 35 inches
long by 23 inches wide, and only six inches deep (Fig. 6, C).
This hearth seemed typical of most of the Lewisville examples, irrespective of which of the five different layer surfaces
they pertained to. It gave the impression of a one-fire hearth
of a transitory nature, utilized by small numbers of people. This
hearth and Hearths 5, 18, and 21 (which were unexcavated and
lost due to the filling of the lake) are geologically earlier than
any others described at the site.
Materials found in the excavation of Hearth 2 include: a
burned and broken distal end of the humerus of Odocoileus vir-

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

29

ginianus; a burned cheek-tooth of the same species of deer; an
unburned hoof of the same species of deer; burned and unburned carapace fragments of Testudo species of land-tortoise.
of two sizes (large and small), plus burned and unburned foot
and toe bones of both tortoises; a burned jaw fragment of Sylvilagus floridanus (cottontail rabbit) ; a burned mussel shell of
Quadrula frustulosa (Lea) ; a burned snail shell of Polygyra cf.
texasiana (Moricand); charred hackberry seeds; and a fireburned nest of the mud-dauber wasp. Two charred fossil pupae
of the mud-dauber wasp were found in the red-burned clay nest.
At the same level (Layer 1 surface), some 10 feet upstream
in the gully wall, was found an unburned horse vertebra.
Hearth 3. Almost directly across the gully from Hearth 2,
but above it at the Layer 2 surface, occurred another typical
small hearth. Its basin was an ellipse, some 35 inches long, 20
inches wide, and red-burned to a depth of seven inches. Charred,
broken fragments of what appeared to be the le~ bones of a
large animal (the size of horse, bison, or camel), a heavily
burned maxilla of Sylvilagus floridanus, burned fragments of
terrapin carapace (from their size, probably T. canaliculata),
and a few charred hackberry seeds, comprised the finds.
At the same level as Hearth 3, some 76 inches northeast,
occurred an unburned horse vertebra. Across the gully at the
same level, within 10 feet of Hearth 3 and between it and
Hearth 1, occurred a series of three horse vertebrae. Five feet
west of the series of vertebrae, again at the Layer 2 surface,
was a broken distal end of a horse metapodial, remarkably like
the one found in ~Hearth 1; in this case, however, it was unburned. Both appear to have been the result of intentional
breakage to extract marrow from the long bones.
Approximately 10 feet further west occurred a well-worked
white flint flake-scraper, also at the Layer 2 surface. Roughly
40 feet northwest of the scraper on the Layer 2 surface a portion of a horse jaw with three teeth, unburned, was found.
Hearth 4. This was one of the most interesting features at
the site. Apparently three different fire pits were dug at almost,

30

Texas Archeological Society

but not quite, the same location. As a result, "Hearth 4" is in
reality a nest of three hearths closely overlapping.
Two deep pits, one with red-burned clay to a depth of 33
inches below the Layer 2 surface, and the other to a depth of
28 inches, demonstrate an overlap of approximately two-thirds.
It is very probable that the deeper pit followed and obscured
the other one, as the 33-inch-deep pit contained a six-inch straturn of unburned yellow sandy clay at a depth of 17 inches below
the Layer 2 surface, seemingly undisturbed. As this unburned
fill still left the hearth as a depression 17 inches deep, it is interpreted as being evidence of human snuffing of a fire rather
than a succeeding flood deposit. This assumption is borne out
by the fact that the third and latest hearth at the spot appears
also to have originated from the same Layer 2 surface, rather
than from a higher position which a flood deposit might have
occasioned.
The third fire at the hearth burned the clay red four inches
thick immediately above the fill, seemingly occupying the partially f!lled depression left from the earlier fires. On top of this
an unburned yellow sandy clay fill occupied the uppermost 13
inches of the hearth basin. In this case it was impossible to
determine the cause of the yellow fill, whether human agency or
a succeeding flood deposit.
The three pits composing the composite Hearth 4 will be considered as Hearths 4-A, 4-B, and 4-C, in the order of their presumed occurrence. Together, their combined area was~a rough
circle, 67 inches north and south, 59 inches east and west, and
with varying depth17 inches, 28 inches, and 33 inches.
Found in the excavation of Hearth 4 were the following: a
large quantity of good charcoal, mainly at the base of Hearth
4-B in small log size; charred mouse teeth and leg-bones, at a
depth of 20 inches; burned leg-bone fragments of a large animal
(possibly the size of horse, bison, or camel) associated with
Hearth 4-C at the surface and at depths of one to 10 inches;
burned egg-shell fragments of a large bird (possibly the size of
turnkey or goose), associated with Hearth 4-C at a depth of
eight inches; burned snail shells of Anguispira altern~ta, gen-

Hearths and A~’tifacts of Early Man Near LewisviIle, Texas

31

erally associated with Hearth 4-B at depths of 17 to 25 inches;
and a few charred hackberry seeds, from both Hearths 4-A and
4-B at depths of 20 to 30 inches.
Hearth 4 lies at the eastern edge of what has been colloquially
called "Rodent Hollow" at the site, due to the large collection of
small mammal remains, mostly unburned but some welt charred,
found in the immediate area, all from erosion of the original
Layer 2 surface. These items, found in an area some 50 feet
square in the years before the multiple hearths were exposed,
include the following: five jaws of prairie dog; three jaws and
assorted skeletal parts of cotton tails and a form of jackrabbit;
a limb-bone of mole; a cheek-tooth of raccoon; a portion of jaw
and jaw-tooth of skunk; the occipital portion of a wood-rat
(packrat) skull; jaw and teeth of a ground squirrel; numerous
terrapin carapace fragments (all seemingly of T. canaliculata) ;
an articulated hind limb of a small Odocoileus virginianus; a
complete ramus and a hoof-bone of the same small species of
deer; a lower canine of black bear; several snail shells of the
Stenotrema monodon aliciae variety; and the teeth of an extinct
peccary, Platygonus allemani. Within 10 feet of the bear canine,
eroding from the same Layer 2 surface, was found the quartzite
chopper, discussed earlier.
These finds can not be assigned to particular hearth areas,
since the presence of hearths in the "Rodent Hollow" area was
not known until after these specimens were collected. Subsequent
erosion exposed not only Hearth 4, but also Hearths 14, 15, 16,
and 17, in the immediate vicinity. The presence of these hearths
explains the concentration of fragmentary fossil remains in
"Rodent Hollow."
Hearth 5. (Not excavated.) Between the partial skeleton of
Camelops and Hearth 7, at the level of Layer 1; a small hearth.
Hearth 6. Exposed on a peninsula between two converging
gully cuts, Hearth 6 appeared to be the remains of another
Layer 2 small hearth, about 38 inches in diameter, and redburned to a depth of nine inches. Due to the presence of great
numbers of charred hackberry seeds, this hearth and the adjacent area was totally excavated in hopes of obtaining a sample

32

Texas Archeological Society

which could be dated by the C-14 method. Finds resulting from
this work include: an unburned and almost complete right
maxilla, palate, and dentition of raccoon; a burned molar of
cottontail; a charred molar of prairie dog; a burned jaw and
teeth of wood-rat (packrat) ; three burned jaws of field-mouse
(Peromyscus sp.) ; three charred cheek teeth of meadow-mouse
(Microtus sp.); burned fragments of terrapin carapace (presumably-from their size T. canaliculata); charred and uncharred vertebrae of a large and a small snake of the Colubrid
family; burned and unburned fragments of egg-shell of a large
bird (possibly the size of turkey or goose) ; an unburned vertebra of a small fish; burned leg-bones of either a frog or a
lizard; charred and uncharred shells of both Anguispira alternata and Polygyra cf. texasiana snails; and multitudinous
burned hackberry seeds. A jar full of these seeds was submitted
to Humble for C-14 dating, but upon their being bathed in acid
it was found that all were essentially carbonate "casts," rather
than being true organic remains.
About half-way between Hearth 6 and Hearth 4, an unburned
lower jaw of raccoon was found. This was at the Layer 2
surface.
Hearth 7. Only 20 feet southeast of Hearth 1 on the Layer 2
surface was Hearth 7. The burned clay basin measured roughly
30 incr~es in diameter, with a depth of five inches at the center.
Most prominent w.ere two large ash beds containing some charcoal which was rather pulverized and intermixed with the clay.
The clay was more lightly fired than in most of the other
hearths, suggesting that the hearth was perhaps used only once.
Burned carapace fragments of terrapin (T. canaliculata?),
charred mouse bones, large numbers of charred snails (both
Anguispira alternata and Mesomphix sp.), and burned hackberry seeds were found.
Hearth 8. Some 60 feet northeast of White’s bison excavation
and nearly 300 feet northeast of Hearth 1, Hearth 8 was another small basin derived from the Layer 2 surface. It measured
roughly 28 inches in diameter and seven inches deep at the
center.

This hearth was of major importance because it contained
four charred logs at the very bottom of the red-burned clay pit
(Fig. 6, F). These little logs were of various thicknesses and
lay scattered, pointing in all directions. It is from this excellent
charcoal sample that the second radiocarbon date was run as a
check on the date from Hearth 1, again yielding a date of "more
than 37,000 years." Barghoorn classified the carbon specimen
as definitely wood charcoal, but stated that the cellular structure had so deteriorated with age as to be unidentifiable.
The usual Lewisville site hearth finds -burned fragments of
terrapin carapace (T. canaliculata?), burned jaws and bones
of mice and rat, charred snail shells of Mesomphix sp., and
burned hackberry seeds--were found in Hearth 8.
Hearths 9, 10, 11, 12. These four were all of the small hearth
variety, exposed at the Layer 5 level in the wall of the borrow
pit above the general area of White’s bison excavation and
Hearth 8. Three were destroyed by erosion and the fourth was
looted by unknown visitors to the site. Nevertheless, certain
information as to their contents is available due to finds remaining even after the erosion and looting.
Hearth 9 apparently contained burned terrapin carapace fragments, burned split bones (probably deer), and charred hackberry seeds. Hearth 10 had at least burned fragments of a large
mussel shell. Hearth 11, looted, still contained part of a molar
tooth of a large-sized horse. Hearth 12 had burned fragments
of terrapin carapace.
Hearth 13. Eight feet west of White’s bison excavation occurred Hearth 13, an ellipse 27 inches long and 20 inches wide,
red-burned to a depth of four inches. A good-sized ash bed
occurred in the center, with very fine pieces of charcoal. Two
badly deteriorated snail shells (Polygyra cf. texasiana) were the
only contents of the basin, but 28 inches to the south, at the
same level, 39 vertebrae of a Colubrid snake were found. The
vertebrae were unburned and essentially articulated, representing the caudal end of the vertebral column.
Hearths 14, 15, 16, 17. These four hearths, which were near
Hearth 4 described earlier, occupied a zone less than 30 feet

34

Texas Areheologica[ Society

square in the center of what has been referred to as "Rodent
Hollow." After sheet-wash exposed the five hearths, the reason
for the concentration of so much small animal bone material
was quite evident. All the hearths lay at the Layer 2 surface.
Hearth 17 lay six feet west of Hearth 4; Hearth 16 was five
feet west of Hearth 17; Hearth 14 was 12 feet southwest of
Hearth 16; and Hearth 15 was five feet, three inches, south of
Hearth 14. In addition, Hearth 14 was four feet, five inches,
south of the quartzite chopper found in place.
Hearth 14 measured 57 inches long, 40 inches wide, and six
inches deep. Finds included: burned and split bones, probably
of deer; burned and unburned hackberry seeds in quantity; a
burned cheek tooth of raccoon; snails of both Anguispira and
Meso~nphix genera; burned rat bones; and burned fragments of
terrapin carapace (T. canaliculata?).
Hearth 15 was a large ellipse, 70 inches long and 42 inches
wide. Its northwestern two-thirds averaged about eight inches
in depth, but the southeastern one-third was a deep red-burned
pit with its bottom 22 inches below the Layer 2 surface. Included in the hearth were an unburned rabbit jaw, charred
fragments of terrapin carapace (T. canaliculata ?), burned bones
and teeth of mice and rats, three heavily burned shells of large
mussel (Arnblema pticata) low in the deep end of the basin,
charred snails of Anguispira type, and charred hackberry seeds.
Hearth 16 was 54 inches long, 32 inches wide, and four inches
deep. Burned fragments of terrapin carapace (T. canaliculata ?),
burned fragments of mussel shell, charred snails of Meso~phix
type, and a few charred hackberry seeds, constituted the con-

tents.
Hearth 17 was a very shallow basin, measuring 33 inches
long, 25 inches wide, and only three inches deep. It contained
only split bone (probably deer) and burned fragments of terrapin carapace.
Hearth 18. Unexcavated and lost to the rising lake. It was at
the Layer 1 surface in the bottom of a gully some 15 feet from
the semi-articulated remains of the young camel at Layer 2
above, in the immediate vicinity of Hearths 7 and 1.

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

35

Hearth 19. Unexcavated and lost to the lake. On the Layer 2
surface; very similar in appearance to Hearth 13 and only 10
feet north of it, near the location of the large deer antler and
about 20 feet east of White’s bison excavation.
Hearth 20. Unexcavated and lost to the lake. At the Layer 5
level in the same borrow pit wall that contained hearths, 9, 10,
11, and 12, and within eight feet of Hearth 11.
Hearth 21. Unexcavated and lost to the lake. Exposed on the
Layer 1 surface in the gully floor just upstream from Hearth
2 on the same level. Erosion by the heavy rains responsible for
the lake rise disclosed this location just a few days before it
was inundated. Apparently it was a medium-sized hearth. Evident in its surface were burned fragments of land turtle and
burned limb bone fragments of a large animal the size of bison,
horse, or camel.
GEOLOGIC ANALYSIS OF THE TRINITY RIVER
ALLUVIAL TERRACES AND THE LEWISVILLE
ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE
Shuler (1935) has described the Trinity River as a consequent stream upon the upland plain of Cretaceous rocks between the Brazos drainage to the west, the Red River to the
north, and the eastward flowing streams of East Texas.
More than three-quarters of the entire Trinity system, including the area discussed in this paper, lie in the Gulf Coastal
Plain physiographic province. Only the headward reaches of
several branches and tributaries penetrate westward into the
North Central Plains region beyond a line extending roughly
from Red River through Fort Worth, Waco, and Austin. As a
result, a very low gradient is characteristic of the Trinity. From
Bridgeport in Wise County, to Trinidad in Henderson County,
a distance of 216 river miles, the Trinity falls at an average
rate of only 12 inches per mile. This part of its course includes
all localities under discussion in this report. From Trinidad to
the Gulf of Mexico, some 400 river miles, the gradient reduces
to only eight inches per mile. Westward, on the upper reaches,
the gradient markedly increases above Bridgeport.

36

Texas Areheological Society

The western headwarters originate in Pennsylvanian and Permian surface outcrops. In the region under discussion, known
locally as "the forks of the Trinity," where the West, Elm, and
East Forks converge to form the main stream, essentially within
Dallas County (Fig. 9), the river crosses progressive outcrops
of Cretaceous strata. Primarily these are, from northwest to
southeast, the Woodbine Sands, the Eagle Ford Shale, the Austin Chalk, and the Taylor Marl. Thence, southeastward, the
stream crosses the Tertiary sequence and ultimately, near the
coast, a belt of Quaternary sediments.
At Dallas, where the West and Elm Forks join inside the city
limits, the main Trinity has cut a notch through the cuesta of
the resistant Austin chalk. The Elm Fork, from the Lewisville
site area in Denton County to the juncture, flows along the contact line between the Eagle Ford Shale to the west and the
Austin Chalk. One of these two Cretaceous formations comprises the country bedrock at all localities to be described, with
the Eagle Ford lying beneath the Lewisville site itself on the
west side of Ehn Fork near the mouth of Hickory Creek.
Apparently the history of the Trinity system is as follows:
the Laramide Revolution at the close of the Cretaceous uplifted
the region above Trinidad from the sea, possibly tilting the
Cretaceous formations, in part at least, at that time. The area
remained as a low-lying coastal plain throughout the Tertiary,
as the strand-line gradually moved southeast and south during
this long era of deposition. Ancient Trinity River may have
originated during this period as a sluggish, short, low-gradient
stream comparable to many Gulf Coast bayous of today. Certainly some stream pattern must have existed prior to the Pliocene-Pleistocene continental uplift for the notch in the present
Austin Chalk cuesta to have been subsequently trenched.
Then, at the close of the Tertiary--and perhaps responsible
for the phenomena of the Pleistocene--a continental batholithic
uplift occurred in Western North America, the subsequent erosion of which has produced today’s Rocky Mountains. This major event may have completed the present tilting of the Cretaceous formations, and is unquestionably responsible for their
present elevation above sea-level; its periodic cycles may well

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

37

have produced the alluvial terrace sequence observable in stream
valleys of Pleistocene age, and it is undoubtedly the ultimate
cause of the present erosional topography and relief.
No Tertiary deposits have been observed in the general region
under discussion; hence the conclusion that throughout this long
period the area was exposed to continental erosion, but was of a
very low elevation not conducive to any notable terrestrial deposition. The local blackland soils of the surviving uplands,
deeply weathered from the underlying Cretaceous outcrops,
strengthen this conclusion. Extensive Pleistocene deposits occur
only in the stream valleys as alluvial terraces, apparently the
result of cyclical stream rejuvenation over a period of general
land rise.
Trinity Alluvial Terraces
The sequence and composition of the Trinity River alluvial
terraces has been described partially by a series of writers and
students. A major revision and description, drawing upon their
experience and tempered by the findings of the present writers,
is in manuscript form. Excerpts from this forthcoming publication will be extensively utilized in the following pages in assessing the geology of the Lewisville site.
Shuler (1935), writing on the terraces of the main Trinity
near Dallas, and Pattillo (1940), writing on the terraces of the
Elm Fork near Carroltton (10 miles below Lewisville), are the
major sources. Briefly, their finds (correlated by Pattillo) and
recent studies indicate the following sequence (see Fig. 7; dual
nomenclature, except for the floodplain, indicates correlated type
localities of the main Trinity and Elm Fork sequences) :
Stream Grade. At Dallas today, the Trinity flows at an elevation of about 365 feet above sea-level.
The Floodplain Terrace (T-O) surface lies at a general elevation of 20 feet above stream grade. Approximately 10 feet of
this is composed of locally-derived alluvium from the adjacent
blackland uplands, while 10 feet is trenched into the underlying
Cretaceous bedrock as a channel cut. A purely modern fauna is
included, with Neo-Indian (pottery, agriculture, and arrow

Texas Archeological Society

points) materials at the base of the alluvium, and Anglo-European materials in the uppermost six inches and upon the
surface.
Union Terminal-Carrollton Terrace (T-l). Represented by
"rises" in the main stream floodplain and by "veneers" upon
the eroded slopes of the next higher terrace near stream valleys.
As much as 30 feet above the present floodplain, or some 50 feet
above stream grade. Approximately 15 feet in thickness. Basal
gravels, 5 feet; red sandy clay (often with pebbles), 5 feet;
gray, unstratified sand, 5 feet. No known fauna from gravels
or red sandy clay; only modern species of bison, deer, and turkey, and a keel-vaulted Homo sapiens, from gray sands. Archaic
Stage human artifacts and site indications in situ in red sandy
clay and gray sands; Neo-Indian artifacts from surface of gray
sands. (New distinction of terrace materials and inclusions.)
Pemberton Hill-Lewisville Terrace (T-2). Stands some 50 feet
above present floodplain or 70 feet above present stream grade.
(New terrace distinction, from former Union Terminal-Carrollton.)

39

Approximate 35-foot section as follows, from base to top:
Basal gravels, 10 feet. Uppermost foot often cemented into
conglomerate. Contains highly mineralized, stream-abraded,
fragmentary faunal remains of general Middle and Upper Pleistocene derivation, some of which are quite possibly redeposited
from erosion of older formations. These remains include representatives of Elephas imperator, Mastodon ?americanus (very
rare), Bison alleni, Equus cf. fraternus, Equus scotti, Camelops
sp., Smilodon cf. fatalis, OdocoiIeus virginianus, ground sloth,
and a huge specimen of Testudo sp. These basal gravels constitute the "Hil! formation" at the Lewisville site. (Local stratigraphy at the Lewisville site is discussed later in this section.)
Laminated yellow sands, five feet. Well bedded, with whitish
calcareous "zones" and platelets, from which calcareous rootfillings often depend. Ferruginous concretions around included
fossils. Fossil wood of deciduous type, occasional. Elephas imperator from contact line with gravels below, in semi-articulated
skeletons; Elephas columbi above, within the formation. Also
large bison, camel, horse, saber-tooth, ground sloth, large Testudo, fox, and deer, none identified as to species. Scales of the
alligator gar fish occur at one locality. This is the "Lower Shuler
formation" at Lewisville.
Yellow sandy clay, 15 feet. Sub-divided into at least seven
successive "layers," each separated from the next by minor erosional surfaces. Whitish calcareous "zones" throughout; massive
development of caliche nodular concretions particularly at each
layer surface, increasing in size from lowest to highest; calcareous root and crotovina fillings from layer surfaces. Many
articulated and semi-articulated faunal remains, including Elephas columbi, Camelops hue~’fanensis dallasi, Tetrameryx shuleri, Equus scotti, Equus cf. fraternus, Odocoileus sp., and Homo
sapiens (Lagow Sand Pit Man, discussed in a later section of
this report), identified previous to the Lewisville studies of this
formation. To these forms must be added the extensive fauna
from Lewisville, listed in the Paleontological Section of this
paper, including the addition of the following large forms not
already listed above: Bison ?taylori, Equus (large sp.), Equus
(medium-sized sp.), Platygonus ?alemanii, Odocoileus virginia-

nus (large sp. and small sp.), Glyptodon sp., Euarctos sp., a
large wolf and coyote, both of Canis sp., and a large land turtle
of Testudo sp. A host of smaller forms also occur, in addition to
artifacts of human manufacture, including a Clovis projectile
point. This is the vital "Upper Shuler Formation" at Lewisville.
Dark gray alluvium, five feet. Contains multitudinous tiny
nodular caliche concretions, and no observed faunal inclusions.
This is the "Richards formation" at the Lewisville site.
Travis School-Farmers Branch Terrace (T-3). Approximately
70 feet above floodplain and 90 feet above stream grade. Section 25 feet thick, composed of: basal gravels and sands, five
feet, with uppermost sands lightly cemented into soft sandstone;
yellow sandy clay with vague whitish "zones" of caliche and
many medium-sized caliche nodular concretions, 15 feet; dark
gray alluvium with tiny caliche nodular concretions, very dry
in appearance, five feet. A proboscidean leg bone from the lowest gravels, a horse toe-bone from the cemented sands, and a
number of semi-articulated skeletons of Mastodon americanus
from the yellow sandy clay, are the only known faunal in-

clusions.
Love Field-Bethel Terrace (T-4). Stands 100 feet above floodplain, some 120 feet above stream grade. Section 30 feet thick,
composed of: basal yellow laminated sands, 20 feet, becoming
impregnated with more and more clay near the top of the formation; dark gray alluvium, 10 feet, dry and notably jointed,
with basal four feet heavily charged with whitish calcareous
"zones" and upper six feet containing tiny caliche nodular concretions. No known fauna.
Buckner Home-Hackberry Creek Terrace (T-5). Stands 145
feet above floodplain, some 165 feet above stream grade. Occurs
only as remnants capping much-dissected high ground at similar
elevations upstream and downstream; upstream examples somewhat higher, indicating downstream gradient of ancient terrace.
Fields of cobbles and boulders of quartzite, petrified wood, ferruginous sandstone, and some flints, with original matrix sluiced
away except near Mesquite in east Dallas County where a fourfoot section remains showing cobbles imbedded in rusty, sandy

formation. Some earth movement discernible since deposition of
terrace, as several mid-stream examples lie at higher elevations
than others both above and below. No faunal remains. (New
terrace identified.)
Cretaceous uplands. Gently rolling erosional topography, beginning at about 175 feet above floodplain, or 195 feet above
present stream grade, and with a general elevation at, or above,
215 feet above floodplain or 235 feet above present grade. Isolated erosional remnants as high as 425 feet above present
stream grade.
Tributary creeks in the region seldom, if ever, evidence the
entire sequence just described, and being locally derived from
the Cretaceous formations of the immediate vicinity, their terrace materials are of a somewhat different nature than those of
the through-flowing Trinity with its distant upstream sources.
Nevertheless, correlation is possible.
These lesser tributaries have not participated in the apparently late cycle of the main stream’s dark alluvial floodplain
deposit; all are deeply trenched at present and seem still to possess sufficient gradient for cutting into the bedrock. Therefore,
their T-O corresponds to the Trinity T-l, with a comparable
triple formation sequence: basal white rock gravels and yellowish-tan clay, four feet; light tan clay with tiny caliche nodules,
six feet; and gray alluvium, four feet. This 14-foot section, in
addition to a cut into the underlying bedrock, often provides a
present channel-cut of as much as 20 feet into the small-stream
floodplain.
At the contact line between the middle and upper fills, corresponding to the disconformity between the light tan clay and
overlying gray alluvium, occur evidences of human occupation
here and there. At one locality, Dixon’s Branch, a Carrollton
Focus Archaic site has been identified; on nearby Ash Creek,
indications are present of another Archaic occupation zone at
this level, including one small hearth. From both sites, the bones
of Bison bison have been tentatively identified, in close association with flint flakes and artifacts and bearing marks of cutting
and butchering. Bones of Odocoileus virginianus also occurred

42

Texas Archeological Society

in lesser numbers in the small hearth, as well as burned mussel
shells and snails.
On the surface of the gray alluvium at several localities occur
sparse occupational sites of relatively late pottery cultures,
though none has as yet demonstrated any evidence of historic
contact materials.
In like manner, the T-1 of the small streams correlates with
the T-2 of the Trinity. This terrace stands some 30 feet above
the floodplain and 45 to 50 feet above stream grade. A 24-foot
section contains: basal white rock gravel, five feet; gray powdery limestone detritus, much like fine sand and often laminated
and sometimes cemented, five feet; gray to light yellow-buff
clay, with vague whitish caliche "zones," 10 feet; and a dark
gray alluvium with tiny caliche nodular concretions, four feet.
Known faunal remains come from the contact line of the gravels
and overlying "sands," including Elephas columbi in semi-articulated condition, Equus sp., and Camelops sp. Well upstream
on several creeks, Archaic occupation sites occur upon the surface of the capping alluvium formation.
A vague indication of even earlier and higher activity of the
tributary streams is given by channel fills preserved in a number of high erosional "divides" of the Cretaceous bedrock. These
contain a reddish clay with caliche nodular concretions, but
their identification with any of the higher main Trinity terrace
events is not yet demonstrated.
Correlation with Louisiana Terrace Sequence
There is little difficulty in correlating the Trinity terrace
system with the classic work of Fisk (1938, 1940) and others,
on the Red River and the Mississippi in Louisiana. In the following comparisons, the work of Fisk in Grant and LaSalle
Parishes (1938) and Avoyelles and Rapides Parishes (1940) is
combined with that of his successors in the Louisiana Geological
Survey. Murray (1948) in DeSoto and Red River Parishes, and
Martin, Hough, Raggio, and Sandberg in Webster Parish (Martin et al., 1954), followed Fisk’s basic tenets and extended their
interpretations up Red River to the Arkansas border.

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

43

The entire state of Louisiana falls within the same Gulf
Coastal Plain physiographic province as does the lower threequarters of the Trinity drainage. However, in Louisiana no
formations older than Tertiary and Quaternary outcrop; the
northern two-thirds of the state are Tertiary, with Pleistocene
and Recent deposits ill the alluvial valleys, while the southern
third is Pleistocene and Recent. Thus the course of the Red
River in Louisiana is comparable with that of the Trinity below
Trinidad, with similar elevations and country bedrock.
Only 150 miles separate the Trinity at Dallas and the Red at
Shreveport. This upper region of the Red presents the greatest
similarity in terrace relationships to the Lewisville-Daltas region of the Trinity. On the Trinity, in this area, the present
gradient is approximately 12 inches per mile; downstream, below Trinidad, it is some eight inches per mile. On the Red River
in north Louisiana it is "less than one foot per mile"; as far
south as Avoyelles and Rapides Parishes, the present gradient
of the Red is roughly five inches per mile. While not identical,
the two drainages are, for practical purposes, highly similar
for geologic terrace studies.
In Louisiana, along Red River, four pronounced terrace formations have been described and evaluated, in addition to a
complex floodplain deposit. From highest to lowest, they are:
Williana Terrace. Standing some 180 feet above the present
floodplain (200 feet above stream grade?), this terrace seems
to correlate closely with the Buckner Home-Hackberry Creek
Terrace (T-5) of the Trinity, which stands at some 145-175
feet above the floodplain near Dallas. The description of Williana remnants in Webster Parish is strikingly reminiscent of
the Buckner Home-Hackberry Creek; "... Williana terrace
deposits . . . are confined to small, remnant patches of basal
sands and gravels capping the highest hills in the area, the
original terrace surface having been eroded away."
Bentley Terrace. Approximately 120 feet above floodplain,
the Bentley in Louisiana seems to represent the Love FieldBethel (T-4) at Dallas which stands 100-110 feet above floodplain. It is very similar in being considerably dissected, with
large remnants here and there remaining untouched.

44

Texas Archeoiogical Society

Montgomery Terrace. Stands roughly 70 feet above floodplain, as does the corresponding Travis School-Farmers Branch
(T-3) of the Trinity. Composition lithologically is quite similar
in presenting the first strongly indicated presence of caliche
nodular concretions in the sequence.
Prairie Terrace. Some 40 feet above floodplain, whereas the
equivalent Pemberton Hill-Lewisville (T-2) of the Trinity lies
at about 50 feet above floodplain. This difference is possibly
accentuated by the narrow gap through the Austin Chalk at
Dallas. The lithologic sequence of the Prairie Terrace, from
basal gravels upward through calcareous clays, is quite comparable to that of the Pemberton Hill-Lewisville terrace.
Floodplain deposits. Here lies the basic, but not critical, difference between the two sequences. The floodplain of the Red
River in Louisiana discloses a deep trench almost totally refilled
today. Borings in this floodplain suggest two different bottom
levels at approximately
35 feet and
70 feet, perhaps indicaring two buried stream-channel periods.
The existence of a buried trench so much deeper than that of
the Trinity at Dallas can be rather easily explained by the relative hardness of the underlying Austin Chalk at Dallas, in contrast to the softer Tertiary sandstone and clay siltstones in
Louisiana which allowed a deeper cut in the same period of
time. In addition, it has been pointed out that the Louisiana
sequence, particularly in the extreme north, compares best with
that of the Trinity below Trinidad, in Tertiary sediments in
Texas. Whereas at Dallas the present floodplain is composed of
only 10 feet of alluvium on top of the Austin Chalk, the floodplain at Trindad and below is considerably deeper and composed
of the sequence gravel-red sandy clay-gray sand, which is seen
only as remnant "rises" in the valley at Dallas.
Thus on the Trinity it can be seen that the Dallas T-l, preserved in floodplain "rises" and in higher terrace "veneers,"
constitutes what is probably the T-0 at Trinidad and downstream. Therefore, the Trinity T-1 at Dallas, as described earlier, probably correlates with the deeper floodplain fill on the
Red River in Louisiana.

Hearths c~nd Artifacts of Early Ma~ Near Lewisville, Texas

45

The very recent alluvial fill of the floodplain on the Trinity at
Dallas rather surely correlates with the more shallow cut-andfill on Red River which, today, constitutes the surface of the
T-0 and has been shown to overlap even late Neo-Indian pottery
culture occupation sites, just as at Dallas.
Thus, even on the upper Trinity, despite a slightly higher
actual elevation and a difference in underlying bedrock, there
is dual evidence of rather late floodplain fills. These fills are
expressed in somewhat different form from those on Red River
in Louisiana, but must, inevitably, represent the same sequence
of events.
Confirming this conclusion is the observation that the most
recent alluvial fill in the Trinity floodplain is of local, redeposited origin from the adjacent Cretaceous uplands. In Louisiana,
the recent fill is described as being "Recent alluvium . . . confined to the floodplain of present-day streams . . . Alluvial deposits consist of material derived from the surrounding Tertiary and Pleistocene deposits . . ." (italics ours).
The absence of identified faunal remains in the Louisiana
terrace sequence, plus the relatively unexplored status of correlated human occupational remains, makes exact correlation
with the Trinity sequence tenuous, but the apparent physical
relationship is almost undeniable. Therefore the following correlations are proposed:

Glacial-Interglacial Theories
Fisk was perhaps the first to correlate alluvial terraces of
coastal plains streams--far-removed from direct glacial effects

46

Texas Archeological Society

--with eustatic changes in sea-level connected with glacial manifestations. Since neither continental glacial advances nor alpine
glacial maxima ever physically reached such regions, his theories are exceedingly valuable in correlation procedures.
In considering the Red River terrace sequence in Grant and
LaSalle Parishes, Fisk states, "The explanation of conditions
under which the Central Louisiana terrace materials were deposited must take into consideration an agency capable of alternating periods of down-cutting, with periods of alluvial drowning. Nothing in the Tertiary history of the Gulf Coast suggests
such an alternation. The glacial epoch, however, seems to offer
precisely the conditions required. It is now quite generally recognized that ice on the land must form from water withdrawn
from the sea; the glacial stages, therefore, were represented by
a lowering of sea-level and by erosion along stream systems.
With retreat of the glaciers, the ocean basins were replenished,
baselevel of streams was raised, and the streams filled the valleys with floodplain materials."
"The depositional stages of the terrace sequence appear to be
correlated with interglacial stages; the valley cutting stages
with glacial advance . . ." (italic ours.)
In like manner Antevs (1955) described downstream activities along the middle courses of river systems in the Southwest.
Speaking of the Middle Colorado near Austin, Texas, he says,
"... Here aggradation of the stream bed takes place mainly
during dry-age, upstream, arroyo-cutting because the large debris masses transported by big arroyo runs are dropped as the
water volume and the stream gradient decrease. Stream entrenchment takes place during relatively moist ages, when the
plant cover is good on the upper reaches, and as a consequence
the water volume in the middle sections is large and the water
relatively clear. A possible result is stream terraces. A good example of a relevant, middle-stream section, is the Texas Colorado River near Austin . . ." (italics ours).
Zeuner (1950) provides a graphic description of "thalassostatic river terraces": "Returning now to the terraces of the
rivers, it has been said that in the lower course, near the sea,

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

47

the fluctuations of the sea-level prevail over the climatic rhythm.
Hence, river terraces formed under the influence of the changing sea-level may be called thalassostatic terraces. Since the sealevel was high in the interglacials (and relatively high, it may
be assumed, in the interstadials), we find that the mild phases
are characterized by compensatory aggradation, the river building up its bed as the sea-level gradually rises. The gravel sheets
deposited in this manner, therefore, contain predominantly
warm faunas .... On the other hand, when, during a glacial
phase, the sea-level was low, the gradient of the lower course
of the river was much increased, and the resulting erosion cut
a narrow valley, and sometimes a gorge, graded to the low sealevel of that time."
Zeuner appears to believe that this effect is fairly well restricted to the tidal reaches of lower river courses, but it should
be obvious that the alternation of such aggradational and erosional cycles would extend upstream through the entire coastal
plain. The recession of sea-leve! during the Pleistocene has been
estimated reliably as of a nature of some 300 to 600 feet; thus,
a stream such as the Trinity, as far as Dallas, could easily have
had its present relative elevation of 365 feet more than doubled,
with a consequent marked effect upon its present-day gradient.
Conversely, if all existing ice were to melt today, it is estimated
that sea-level might rise an additional 100 feet or more; this in
turn would definitely reduce further the present low gradient
of the Trinity at Dallas.
Flint (1957) expresses a somewhat similar theory near the
close of his chapter on the "Fluctuation of Sealevel": "...
Along considerable stretches of some rivers the general effect
of these slow fluctuations would have been twofold: (1) filling
of valleys with sediment by slackened streams, and (2) erosion
of valleys by accelerated streams..."
Therefore it would appear that the Trinity terrace sequence,
including the T-2 containing the Lewisville site, would be the
result of periods of an interglacial nature, and the intervening
valley cuts would be the result of glacial advances. The fauna
described in the Paleontological Section of this report supports

48

Texas Archeological Society

this conclusion, as it appears to indicate a climate certainly no
cooler than the present (interglacial?) and possibly somewhat
warmer than today.
General Pleistocene Correlations
Fisk found himself inconvenienced by his five definite cutting
cycles in correlating his terrace sequence with the accepted
Pleistocene series of four main glaciations. His answer was to
break the Wisconsin, or Fourth Glaciation, into two major
phases, an "Early Wisconsin" and a "Late Wisconsin," separated by a major interstadial to which he attributed the formation of the Prairie terrace. Recalling the long-standing controversy regarding the inclusion of the Iowan sub-stage in the
Wisconsin, as opposed to considering it a separate glaciation,
and in view of the fact that in either event it was separated
from the next sub-stage by a definite interstadial named the
"Peorian," it was logical for Fisk to indicate that his late terrace-building interstadial was the Peorian. In the light of the
current state of flux of the Late Pleistocene sequence, such a
name may or may not be useful or specifically correct at this
time.
Fisk’s correlation chart is herewith reproduced in part:
Post-Glacial ...................... Recent Alluvium

The Prairie member, which Fisk in this chart assigns to the
Peorian, is correlated in the present paper with the Pemberton
Hill-Lewisville terrace of the Trinity, as has already been discussed.

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

49

In any event, Fisk differentiated between an Early Wisconsin
and a Late Wisconsin, separated by a major interstadial to
which he attributed the Prairie terrace. It is perhaps remarkable that an interstadial could produce a terrace of a magnitude
comparable with those deposited in previous interglacials, but
such may be the case. Disregarding for the present the unestablished theory of five Pleistocene glaciations, with four intervening interglacials, it is certain that the Prairie and Pemberton
Hill-Lewisville terraces were deposited as floodplains prior to
the last major glacial event of the Pleistocene, whether called
"Late Wisconsin" or something else. On the Trinity, the general
fauna from the many exposures of the Pemberton Hill-Lewisville terrace (including the Lewisville site itself) is unquestionably Upper Pleistocene, with an abundance of extinct forms to
support any of these several possibilities.
All in all, a series of five glacial stages, with four intervening interglacials, plus a Post-Glacial period of deposition, would
best fit the terrace situation on the Trinity and Red Rivers. In
particular this scheme would provide an additional interglacial
later than the .Sangamon, to which the Prairie terrace stage
could be assigned. Until some such scheme develops, however,
Fisk’s correlation, reproduced above, must stand. The Pemberton Hill-Lewisville terrace (T-2) of the Trinity, at the Lewisville site and elsewhere, is here correlated with Fisk’s Prairie
member.
Should a fifth glacial stage be differentiated, then the Lewisville site terrace would fall in the sequence as follows:
Post-Glacial .... Floodplain and Union Terminal-Carrollton
Wisconsin ............................ Erosion interval
"New Interglacial". ........... Pemberton Hill-Lewisville
"New Glacial". ........................ Erosion interval
Sangamon ................ Travis School-Farmers Branch
Illinoian .............................. Erosion interval
Etc., etc.
In any case, the terrace containing the Lewisville site rather
definitely appears to represent a mild, warm interstadial or
interglacial period in the Late Pleistocene. This situation is in

5O

Texas ArcheoIogical Society

contrast to that of most Early Man sites in America, which are
associated with pluvials and cold-moist periods normally accompanying a glacial sub-stage maximum, or early in its decline.
In addition, while moist extremes are recorded in the Trinity
T-2 terrace at Lewisville apparently exceeding today’s precipitation, numerous alternations to the opposite, dry, extreme are
also evident, repeated times when caliche formed in a region
where caliche formation is out of the question today.
The terrace can scarcely be ascribed to the Recent because of
the extinct fauna included in it and the magnitude of the subsequent alluvial history.
Local Stratigraphy at the Lewisville Site
Fig. 8 illustrates the section of the Pemberton Hill-Lewisville
terrace (T-2) at the Lewisville site itself. The diagram is most
representative of the center area of the site, as to the east the
Lower Shuler laminated yellow sands were preserved in thicker
section. The erosional surface between the Lower Shuter sands
and the Upper Shuler clays sloped definitely down towards the
west, evidence of a channel-cut in this direction at that period.
In addition, the depth of the basal Hill gravels could not be
ascertained as none of the deepest gully cuts penetrated to bedrock. Only about three feet, at most, of the top of the gravels
were exposed anywhere at the site.
The local stratigraphy at the Lewisville site is as follows:
Bedrock. Presumably the Cretaceous Eagle Ford Shale, to
judge from numerous exposures immediately upstream and
downstream from the site, and also on the west side of Elm
Fork valley. Not exposed at the site itself, but revealed in the
recent Santa Fe Railroad cut just south of the dam, where an
identical section is displayed in an as yet uneroded condition.
Hill formation. Basal gravels of the Pemberton Hill-Lewisville terrace (T-2) of the Trinity River. Depth unknown at the
site, as only the topmost three feet were penetrated by the deepest gullies. Typical lithological content, displaying iron cementation in topmost levels into a tough conglomerate layer, including

Hearths and A~’tifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

51

at Lewisville a cemented sandstone lens of some eight inches.
Highly mineralized fossil bone fragments, particularly proboscidean leg bones, horse teeth (large), and fragments of carapace
of very large land turtle (Testudo sp.), all thoroughly mineralized, as usual in this formation.
Lower Shuler formation. Laminated yellow sands, generally
stained by limonite but banded in areas with manganese-stained
layers. Calcareous zones and plates, with calcareous root-fillings
dependent. Varies in thickness at the site from a maximum of

about 10 feet in the east wall of the pit, tapering to some three
feet at the center of the site, and to a total pinch-out in the
western area of the pit where the Upper Shuler rests disconformably directly upon the Hill gravels. This situation strongly
suggests channel-cutting of some nature to the west of the main
Lewisville site area in late Lower Shuler, or immediately postLower Shuler, time. No fossils have been observed in the Lower
Shuler formation at the site.
Upper Shuler formation. Sandy yellow clays, apparently the
result of successive layers of deposition of similar material
over a continuing period of time. At least seven distinct layers
are recognized, each representing individual flooding periods
with temporary surfaces established at the conclusion of each,
and with minor erosion and channel-filling evident. Layer 1 is
approximately two feet thick; Layer 2 is about three feet thick
on the average; Layers 3, 4, 5, and 6 vary from six inches to
as much as one and one-half feet thick; Layer 7, at the top, is
about five feet thick. Each layer is characterized by formation
of nodular caliche concretions at its surface, increasing progressively in size from bottom to top. Vague, whitish, "soft
caliche" zones are found throughout; calcareous fillings of holes
of rodents, crayfish, and roots are also present, especially in the
lower layers. Human occupation fire-hearths occurred at layer
surfaces: three atop Layer 1; 13 on the Layer 2 surface; one on
the Layer 3 surface; and four on the Layer 5 surface. Burned
bones occurred within the hearths, and unburned bones were
adjacent to the hearths on layer surfaces nearby. The fossils
are partially mineralized and caliche-encrusted. Artifacts were
found within and outside of the hearths. The hearths and associated fossils and artifacts are described in detail elsewhere in
this report.
Richards formation. Dark gray, very dry alluvium. Contains
tiny nodular caliche concretions throughout. No observed faunal
remains. Total of five-foot thickness. Obvious channel-fills into
surface of underlying Upper Shuler in places.
Disregarding local variations in thickness of the formations,
individual inclusions, and differing upstream lithologic provenience, the pattern of this particular terrace and its sub-forma-

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Nea.r Lewisville, Texas

53

tions can be duplicated and easily correlated on other stream
systems in the region. For example, this local Trinity River
expression can be matched with comparable exposures on the
Red River to the north, the Sabine and Sulphur systems to the
east and northeast, the Brazos at Waco to the south, and the
Leon even farther south and southwest. Along the Trinity and
its forks and tributaries, the sequence varies somewhat in thickness and lithologic origin, but the correlation is obvious.
In comparing and correlating the terraces of the Trinity with
those of the Red River as described by Fisk and others, it should
be pointed out that Fisk and his students have followed the
geologic technique of observing the terrace formations from a
macro-view, whereas the writers, as archeologists, have studied
the sub-formations of the Trinity terraces from a micro-view,
placing much greater emphasis on individual sub-formations
which, even though only a few inches thick, may represent an
important interval of a thousand years or more in the archeo~
logical sequence. With this consideration in mind, the published
descriptions can be seen to bear a satisfactory similarity to the
sequence described in this report.
Even as Gulf Coastal Plain stream terraces seem representative of the effects of interglacials and interstadials, and valleycuts tend to be correlated with glacial advances (or sub-stage
halts and readvances), so also is there a tempting possibility of
matching terrace sub-formation depositions and intervening
minor erosional disconformities with sub-stage waxing and
waning of the Pleistocene ice sheets. It is here that a word of
caution needs to be entered.
It should be apparent that in continental glaciations, alpine
glaciations, and even in non-glaciated regions where pluvial lake
beaches or sea-level beaches are concerned, in the practical
sense only the late, relatively minor (and progressively more
so) oscillations are preserved for interpretation, following the
maximum effect produced by the geologic phenomenon. Thus,
while glacial retreat "X" may have had five sub-stages (each
of which may include advances, halts, retreats, and readvances)
in its history, if Sub-stage No. 2 represented its maximum extent, then no more than the last three sub-stages of its retreat

54

Texas Archeological Society

are preserved for present geological study. Therefore, only the
glacial drifts or tills, the pluvial lake beach lines, the terrace
sub-formations, and the ocean beach-strands associated with its
progressive retreat stages, after the maximum, can be expected
to be preserved for a geological study.
Even so, the deposition of alluvial terrace fills, such as the
Hill gravels, must have begun shortly after the commencement
of retreat of the glaciations, following their maximum extension. This being the case, alluvial terrace formations of nonglaciated coastal regions, as at Lewisville, can be expected to
represent the period of degtaciation immediately following glacial maxima, plus the first half or more of the ensuing interglacial or interstadial period. The evidence at the Lewisville site
indicates that a progressive retreat series of some four episodes
of retreat-halt-readvance must have occurred in the deglacial
and the ensuing interglacial (or interstadial), following the
valley cut which preceded the T-2 terrace deposition. This cut is
correlated at the latest with "Early Wisconsin."
IDENTIFICATION OF PALEONTOLOGICAL REMAINS
Faunal material was relatively abundant at the Lewisville
site, although generally quite fragmentary and usually in the
form of bone scrap. Some floral materia! was also present. These
materials were concentrated in, and in the immediate vicinity
of, the numerous hearths. Collections of known provenience
over the past six years, and their several identifications, are
described in the following paragraphs.
1. River Basin Surveys. White (personal communication) lists
the following from his original paleontological salvage work:
Bison sp.
Equus sp.
Glyptodon sp.
deer
packrat
"large land turtle of Gopherus type"
hackberry seeds

He~rths and Arti/acts Of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

55

The bison specimen consisted of a skull and four cervical
vertebrae, which today are in the U. S. National Museum. Unfortunately they have not yet been unpacked and identified as
to species. According to some observers at the time of excavation, the size and straightness of the horn cores suggested affiliation with the Bison antiquus taylori type, but this is not yet
scientifically confirmed.
White’s test excavation of one of the hearths yielded a horse
vertebra, split deer bones, bones of packrat, and hackberry
seeds, all burned. In addition, he recovered from the general
site area a horse jaw, glyptodon scutes, and carapace fragments
of his "Gopherus type" land turtle.
After considerable communication with White on the matter,
the authors feel that all of his finds were probably derived from
what is now referred to as the Layer 2 surface. His excavation
pit for the bison was still to be observed upon this surface until
the rising lake destroyed the site.

Several of the identifications were uncertain due to the nature of the material furnished Skinner. ?Bison is based upon a
fragmentary tooth; bison teeth are not diagnostic for specific
identification. "Proboscidean" is based upon a femur-head and
one tusk; without teeth or more of the skeleton, identification
of the species of mammoth is not possible. Nine jaws and one
maxilla of rabbit presented a difficult problem of identification
upon which Skinner suggested further study. The Colubrid
snakes are represented only by vertebrae, and the "amphibian
or reptile" only by small, fragmentary limb bones. The Pisces
specimen is comprised of only two vertebrae. The Aves determination is based only upon fragments of a large egg shell.
3. University of Michigan. At Skinner’s suggestion that the
turtle fauna was worthy of a specialist’s attention, these materials were referred to Thomas M. 0elrich. Oelrich’s report
on Skinner’s "Testudo (large)" and "Terrapene (large)" is as
follows:
Testudo sp.
Terrapene canaliculata Hay
Oelrich confirmed that both types were extinct, but because
of the fragmentary nature of the Testudo carapace remains,

4. University of Michigan. Through the good offices of Skinner
and Oelrich, Claude W. Hibbard agreed to examine those of
the small mammal forms which presented special identification
problems. The following are his assessments:
Mephitis mephitis ............ stripe& skunk
Proeyon lotor ............... raccoon
Cynomys ludovicianus ........ prairie dog
Scalopus aquaticus ........... eastern mole
Sciurus niger ................ fox squirrel
Microtus sp .................. meadow vole
Peromyscus gossipinus ....... cotton mouse
Peromyscus leucopus or
maniculatus ............... white-footed or deer mouse
Sylvilagus floridanus ......... eastern cottontail rabbit
Lepus (new species?) ......... jack rabbit family
5. Smithsonian Institution. John W. Harrington of Southern
Methodist University arranged to have W. F. Foshag identify
the articulated skull, jaws, and vertebrae of a snake, found by
a student on a geological field trip to the Lewisville site borrow
pit (Harrington, 1953). Foshag’s identification is as follows:
Family Colubridae, marked similarity to genus
Drymarchon.
This grass snake was reported to have been found in the
vicinity of White’s finds, and hence must have come from the
general site area.
6. Southern Methodist University. The snail and mussel faunas, recovered almost exclusively from within the hearths themselves, have been identified by Elmer P. Cheatum. Collaboration
was furnished by Henry van der Shalie of the University of
Michigan.

7. Miscellaneous. A burned nest of the mud-dauber wasp was
recovered from Hearth 2. The presence of crayfish is indicated
both by caliche-filted crotovinas suggestive of crayfish holes
(distinguished from larger ones suggestive of holes of the
prairie dog, both types of holes being distinguishable from
irregular root holes which were also present) and by the pres~
ence of raccoon, whose diet is normally made up in large measure of crayfish. Finally, a paleobotanical identification: the
writers collected large numbers of hackberry seeds of the general Celtis family, which occurred without exception in the
hearths.
Comments on identifications. White’s bison is very probably of
an extinct type, although this cannot be stated with absolute
surety. Skinner’s bison identification has been conservatively
referred to the "living" classification on the basis of the fragmentary tooth specimen, completely non-diagnostic in itself. It
is worthy of note that no identification of the living form, Bison
bison, has ever been made from the Upper Shuler geologic formarion along the Trinity River system. With the large number
of extinct Pleistocene forms, including extinct bison, identified
elsewhere in the immediate area from this same formation, it
would be most surprising for the bison from the Lewisville site
.to be anything but an extinct type.
As for the mammoth remains, identified only as "Proboscidean," it should be noted that mammoth bones are common in
the Upper Shuler formation along the Trinity. To date, all identified specimens have been referred to Elephas columbi, and thus
it would be unique for the two occurrences at Lewisville (one
from Layer 1 and one from Layer 2) to be anything else. To
eliminate another possibility, there is no known record of
Mastodon from the Upper Shuler.
While rabbits have changed remarkably little since the Pliocene, the numerous rabbit occurrences at Lewisville are still

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

59

informative in nature. The ordinary cottontail, Sylvilagus floridarius, is present in large numbers in the area today. The modern representative of the jack rabbit, Lepus californicus, is
likewise common, though in distinctly smaller numbers than the
cottontail. At the time of the Lewisville site occupation, however, the Lepus family representative does not seem to have
been the same as the existing jack rabbit. This may indicate
that enough time has passed since then for a sub-specific change
to have taken place in the evolution of this widely distributed
prairie animal.
Not included in the faunal specimens submitted for identification was a large camel skull found near White’s bison excavation. Before this unquestionable example of Camelops could be
properly removed and preserved, unknown persons looted and
destroyed the specimen. Since Skinner’s Camelops identification
was based upon the limb bones of an immature individual, the
last specimen almost certainly represented a second, adult, occurrence of the type in the site.
The two sizes of deer identified raise interesting questions.
The smaller Odocoileus virginianus A is markedly suggestive
of the small Sonoran type found today in North Mexico adjacent
to the Texas border, considerably south of the Lewisville region.
The larger version, Odocoileus virginianus B, is today more
comparable with specimens found far to the north in the Eastern United States, for instance in Michigan. Neither sub-species
seems typical of the white-tail deer found today in Texas. It
may have been that climatic differences occasioned the occurrence of the smaller type this far north in Lewisville times,
while lack of modern "trophy-hunting" pressure may have
allowed, in those early days, the survival of larger, and older,
bucks of the typically modern Texas deer.
In the identified snail fauna, it is most significant that the
two species most common today in the area are not represented
by a single specimen in the Lewisville collections. Conversely,
of all the Lewisville snails recorded from the hearths, only
Polygyra cf. texasiana is found today in the immediate region,
and then only rarely. As these organisms are highly specialized
in climatic adaptation, and have remained relatively static, in

60

Texas Archeological Society

terms of evolutionary change, over vast periods of geologic time,
they indicate a climate different from that of today.
If we combine the several vertebrate identifications, add
White’s glyptodon finds, and rule in favor of an extinct form of
bison as discussed previously, some nine of the 30 possible forms
of vertebrates at Lewisville appear to be extinct, and in addition there may be a new variety of jack rabbit. It is well known
that, almost without exception, the smaller vertebrate forms,
as well as the mollusks, have not evolved new species in such
a short and recent a period as the Pleistocene. As a result, it
seems most probable that the entire assemblage at Lewisville
is Late Pleistocene, rather than Recent, in date.
Numerical occurrence. Beyond the specific identifications, a
review of the numerical occurrence of animal forms at Lewisville brings out significant facts.
Overwhelmingly, either inside or outside the hearths, land
turtles are the most common vertebrate form. At least 24 individuals have been recorded by the writers, including three of
Testudo and 21 of Terrapene canalicuIata. In addition, there is
White’s possible Gopherus specimen, as yet not officially identified. Testudo and Terrapene canaliculata are known to be extinct; the Gopherus specimen is still uncertain as to its evolutionary status. Land turtles are relatively low in the animal
scale and are not considered prime examples of rapid evolution
and adaptation; therefore, the fact that extinct forms are the
most numerous item at the site, to the practical exclusion of
living types, suggests that a considerable period of time has
elapsed or that there has been a major faunal change due to
climate shifts.
The next most common vertebrates are the rabbits, with 13
examples. The majority, as today, represent the living cottontail. It is also not unusual that the minority (also as today in
the region) are of the Lepus or jack rabbit group; but the
Lewisville specimens probably represent a new species, which
is possibly now extinct--and is certainly extinct in this area.
The specimens of the two sizes of Odocoileus virginianus rep-

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

61

resent probably nine individuals. Both sizes of this species of
deer are living forms today.
Mice represent some nine individuals, all of living forms.
Eight seemingly are Peromyscus, while one is Microtus. Zoologists consider Microtus recently extinct in Texas, the last recorded occurrence being in the early 1900’s in extreme Southeast Texas.
Combined, the specimens of the two sizes of horse are believed
to total eight individuals. Two are of the large type and six
represent the medium-sized Equus. Both forms are extinct.
Eight examples of the living prairie dog occur in the site. In
historic times, this animal approached the Lewisville region no
closer than Archer County, Texas, some 100 miles to the west.
Its presence in some numbers at the Lewisville site suggests
more arid conditions than today, as indicated also by the caliche
formation in the Upper Shuler formation.
Next in numerical importance are raccoon with 5 individuals,
and woodrat (packrat) with four, both forms living in the area
today.
Of the remaining scattered occurrences, the extinct forms are
as follows: mammoth, two; bison (presumed extinct), two;
camel, two; peccary, one; and glyptodon, one.
The remaining living forms are: Colubrid snakes, five; skunk,
two; fox squirrel and ground squirrel, two; birds, two; bear,
one; wolf, one; coyote, one; mole, one; frog or lizard, one; and
fish, one.
Of the three species of mussel recovered, all are living forms
throughout the vast Mississippi drainage. Only Amblema plicata, from Hearth 15, is useful in interpretation as it is known
to prefer sluggish waters, ooze and muck best of all. This suggests a possible cut-off ox-bow of the ancient Elm Fork near
the Lewisville site at the time of occupation, a circumstance that
in turn postulates a choked stream bed with a meandering
channel, the gradient having been reduced until it was quite low.
The mud-dauber wasp, the presumed crayfish, and the hackberry trees presumed to be in the vicinity, tell us little about

62

Texas Archeological Society

the environment of the site at the time of occupation other than
by the fact that in modern distribution they are neither arctic
nor tropical.
INFERRED CLIMATE OF THE OCCUPATION
A number of considerations indicate that the climate prevailing in the Lewisville region at the time of occupation must
not have been greatly different from that of today; certainly
no cooler, and quite possibly somewhat warmer, at least in the
winters. In the alternation of precipitation cycles, it does appear
that the moist and dry extremes may both have exceeded present-day records, but within the framework, and against the
background, of a temperature average as warm as, or warmer
than, that observed today. At either extreme, it is suggested by
the evidence that the present conditions of timbered streamdraws running through grassy, upland prairies, were merely
accentuated or reduced, from time to time.
Climatic conditions of the past several thousand years are
those of an interglacial or major interstadial, if they do not
indeed signal the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of
an entirely new epoch. Many articles dealing with the weather
in the past few years have pointed out the current definitely
warmer trend.
Therefore, the evidence strongly indicates that the climate of
the Lewisville site occupation was that of an interglacial or
major interstadial interval comparable to the present. The presence of extinct fauna rules out a Recent date. Considered as a
whole, the terrace--including the older forms from the gravels
below the occupational strata--could date from the last interglacial or any of the succeeding Wisconsin interstadials; in any
case, it is certainly Late Pleistocene in date. The geology of the
alluvial sequence points to an interglacial or to a major interstadial between two pronounced cycles of glacial activity within
the Wisconsin, or Fourth, Glaciation.
Most of the flora and fauna found at the site demonstrate
today a wide range of habitat within the temperate zone. This
conclusion is based on observation of the environment of iden-

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

63

tical modern species, and upon living forms which are related
to Lewisville species and are assumed to have possessed similar
environmental adaptations.
Such generalized temperate zone forms indicate that, much as
today, neither a severe boreal nor a strong tropica! displacement
of climatic zones was in effect during the time of occupation.
Certain individual species suggest a somewhat warmer climate
than today, and a number attest to extremes of both more moist
and dryer climate than at present. The total absence of any representative of a "cold fauna" may not be considered unduly
significant this far south, but the presence of types more common now in warmer regions--in a few cases, actually confined
to warmer climatic zones--is noteworthy, as today’s climate is
considered to be definitely that of an interglacial, or at least
an interstadiah
The Lewisville site falls in the southern half of the area
between 40° and 50°F. January isotherms (McNally, 1956).
Denton County, in which Lewisvil!e is located, has a January
norm of 44.5°F., based on the last 34 years’ record maintained
by the U. S. Weather Bureau. Minimum temperature recorded
in this period is --3°F. ; average dates for first and last killing
frosts are, respectively, November 10 and March 27 (McGregor,
1955). While mild by most Northern Hemisphere standards, the
climate today in Denton County: even in the present-day interglacial or interstadial, is not friendly to sub-tropical flora and
fauna. The average 132-day killing frost period each Winter
would discourage almost any truly "warm" assemblage, and
the recorded maximum low of --3°F.--even if sporadic in occurrence-would complete the job..
Therefore, it is most significant that a number of forms which
normally prefer a warmer climate today than that in Denton
County, should be recorded at the Lewisville site.. This is interpreted as definite evidence of interglacial or interstadial conditions at the time of occupation. It is well established that most,
if not a!l, of the interglacials--and a number of the interstadials
--produced a higher average temperature in the Northern Hemisphere than exists at present.

The remains of the lower orders of animals are perhaps most
instructive, since they are the least adaptive to environmental
changes.
Undoubtedly the most common vertebrate fossils at the site
are the land turtlesterrapins and tortoises. Of these, Terrapene canaliculata comprises probably 90% or more, being represented by charred, fragmentary specimens in 12 of the 18
hearths investigated, plus numerous unburned examples adjacent to, or on the same stratigraphic level with, the general
hearth-site area. The large Testudo species are represented by
the minor proportion of turtle remains, definitely burned specimens being found only in Hearth 2, and unburned specimens
being in the form of only a few fragments of carapace found
elsewhere throughout the site.
T. canaliculata is considered to be indistinguishable in all
characteristics, except its distinctly larger size, from T. carolina,
living today. It is unquestionably the ancestor of the living
form. The known and studied Late Pleistocene localities of T.
canaliculata are--in addition to Lewisville--Florida, San Patricio County in Coastal South Texas, and Friesenhahn Cavern
in Bexar County, Texas (Milstead, 1956). All of these locations,
except Lewisville, fall well south of the 50°F. January isotherm
today, and thereby suggest a Pleistocene climate warmer than
that of today at Lewisville. A very closely related species, T.
llanensis, described from Southwest Kansas, have been interpreted as evidence of an interglacial period there (Hibbard,
1955). It is also informative that the group represented today
by T. carolina, favors a wooded habitat more common to the
Southeastern United States, suggesting more moist conditions
than those now prevailing at Lewisville.
Today, the existing species of Testudo are confined to the
tropics of North and South America (Williams, 1950). Even
the living Nearctic branch of the Gopherus family, restricted as
it is to the southern Gulf States and Atlantic Coastal States,
South Texas, and Southern California, inhabits the warmest
regions of the United States. Therefore, a large, extinct example of Testudo at Lewisville is very definitely considered to be
evidence of an interglacial or interstadial climate, warmer by

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

65

some degree than that of today. The presence of Testudo also
indicates a more humid environment.
Among the five species of land snails identified in charred
condition in 12 of the 18 Lewisville hearths investigated, it is
highly significant that neither of the two most common snail
species of the region today is represented by a single specimen.
On the other hand, four of the five species at Lewisville can
scarcely be found in the Lewisville region today; the fifth, Polygyra cf. texasiana, can be collected in the area, but not easily.
The first four, Stenotrema monodon, Stenotrema ~nonodon aliciae, Mesomphix species, and Anguispira alternata, are more
typical of present-day, better-watered, humid environments. Today, the Stenotrema types are to be found in the vicinity of the
springs around San Marcos, in South Central Texas. The Anguispira specimens are to be collected in the "Big Thicket"-a sub-tropical remnant in Polk, Tyler, and Hardin Counties, in
the extreme Southeast Texas region. Both areas are distinctly
warmer and more moist (because of the Balcones Fault springs
in the San Marcos area, and because of heavier annual rainfall
in the "Big Thicket") than the Lewisville area today. Mesomphix
is to be found today in the better-watered forest regions from
Louisiana to Michigan. Polygyra has a variable habitat, ranging
from deep woodland to heavy turf on grassy prairie.
Glyptodon, present at Lewisville, is recorded only from the
southern United States, even in interglacials. Without doubt
this is a South American immigrant, its range restricted to
warm climatic conditions. The living relative, the armadillo, has
been until recently restricted to South Texas and portions of
Southwest Arizona. Very recent expansion--perhaps in part via
tourist transplantation and in part because of modern climatic
warming changes--has moved the northern edge of its range
into Northeast Texas, Southern Oklahoma, and even Arkansas
and North Louisiana. In any event, the range of the living member of the family, and the range indicated by the recorded
occurrences of the extinct Glyptodon, is largely restricted to the
present sub-tropical regions of the United States. Rare as its
fossil records are, Glyptodon at Lewisville is not an indicator
of killing frosts or sub-zero weather at the time of occupation.

66

Texas Archeological Society

The living peccary (Pecari angulatus) probably extended over
most of Texas, the southwest corner of Arkansas, and parts of
Southern Arizona in very recent historical and prehistoric times.
The presence of its presumed ancestor, Platygonus alemanii, at
Lewisville suggests a climate certainly no more rigorous than
that of today. That this extinct form is also recorded as far
north as Kentucky in fossil form may possibly be attributed to
interglacial northward extension of range in excess even of
recent times. Today, the living peccary--or "javelina" is restricted to extreme Southwest Texas (below San Antonio) and
Southern Arizona, southward through Central and South America as far as Patagonia.
Although living peccaries run in packs, they never exist in
such numbers to be a major part of a faunal population in any
given area. They constitute a rare fossil, indeed, in known sites
of Early Man. Likewise: fossils of Glyptodon are rarely associated with Early Man sites. That both occur at Lewisville is
therefore a remarkable coincidence, very possibly suggesting
their relative abundance in the region, although stil! in small
total numbers. This circumstance would, in turn, strengthen
the theory that the climate at the time of the Lewisville occupation was somewhat warmer than today.
The occurrence of Microtus (meadow mouse) at Lewisville
is interesting. The recorded modern occurrences in Texas are
limited to two, both reported about 50 years ago: one from the
Guadalupe Mountains in the far west (in an Alpine biotic zone),
and one in extreme Southeast Texas near Beaumont. Since the
time of these reports, exhaustive search by naturalists has failed
to produce another example, leading to the conclusion that
Microtus no longer occurs in the region. The meadow mouse is
considered to belong in more moist areas, and its occurrence at
Lewisville is in agreement with some of the other faunal occurrences there which we have already reviewed.
Cynomys ludovicianus, the prairie dog, almost equals the
horses and deer in frequency of occurrence at Lewisville. This
form is unquestionably representative of semi-arid grasslands,
and is indicative of dryer conditions than today at the site.

Hearths and Artifact~ of Early Ma~ Near Lei~isville, Texas

Historically, the eastern edge of the range of the prairie dog
was in Archer County, Texas, 100 miles west of Lewisville. The
average annual precipitation in Archer County is 24.6 inches,
in contrast to 35.0 inches in Denton County. Obviously the occurrence of this species, in considerable numbers, suggests the
dry extremes of the climatic fluctuations during the span of
occupation at the Lewisville site. Even in the present environraent of timbered stream valleys and grassy uplands, there are
no prairie dogs on the uplands; yet at the time of Lewisville
this form must have been relatively abundant in the area.
Formation of caliche, both in nodular concretion form and in
vague, "soft caliche" zones, at each of the successive levels in
the Upper Shuler formation at Lewisville, is most significant.
By accepted standards, this circumstance requires a reduction
in annual rainfall to less than 14 inches per year--a marked
change from the present, and similarly different from the humid
climate indicated by the numerous evidences interpreted and
described above. That this dry oscillation occurred often and
regularly during the Lewisville occupation is amply recorded in
the caliche formation at each successive layer surface in the
Upper Shuler formation. Red-burned caliche nodules and unburned nodules in the hearths conclusively illustrate that the
human occupation occurred both before and after some of the
dry periods. The presence in the hearths of faunal remains
pertaining to both moist and dry conditions confirms this conclusion.
It may well be that "wet" and "dry" are relative terms as
regards the formation of caliche. In reality, "net precipitation,"
the quantity of moisture actually available to plants and animals, may be the determining factor. Higher temperatures in a
time of moderate rainfall may so increase the evaporation that
the "net precipitation" may only be equal to that of a "dry"
period. While not provable geologically, this is an attractive
and plausible theory, strongly supported by a comparison of
rainfall records in Nebraska and the Texas Panhandle country.
Both areas experience similar rainfall, but the evaporation differences make for more moist conditions in Nebraska than exist
400 miles due south in the Texas Panhandle region.

68

Most authorities do not feel that evidence of a dry climate in
non-glaciated regions is suggestive of a time of glacial advance.
This opinion is in accord with the proposed interglacial or major
interstadial interpretation of the geology and paleontology at
Lewisville. That both dry and wet cycles alternate is, again, in
favor of the interglacial-interstadial theory. That both grasslands and forest types of fauna occur together at Lewisville is
strongly indicative of the mixed condition of timbered draws in
an area of upland grasslands, such as exists at Lewisville today.
The human occupation, although covering a considerable span
of time, is considered to be more closely associated with the
wetter phases. Everything seems to suggest a period warmer
than today, perhaps at times more moist, and most probably
representative of an interglacial or major interstadial epoch.
As a final consideration in this discussion of inferred past
climate, we note that it is possible to argue that extinct faunal
types may not necessarily have had the same climatic adaptations as their living relatives. In this vein, paleontologic finds
both north and south of present ranges may be quoted. But
until such geographical displacements can be unquestionably
interpreted in the light of recognizable periods of glacial advance or of interglacial recession, such "variable adaptation"
theories are meaningless. In other words, unless a member of
a present-day tropical family can be shown to have existed in
the north during a period of glacial advance, or a cold-climate
form can be shown to have lived in the south during an interstadial, an occurrence does not perforce indicate a different
adaptation from that of living representatives of the same
group. It may simply demonstrate interglacial extension of
warm faunas or glacial extension of cold forms.
RADIOCARBON DATINGS
Through the generosity and cooperation of the Humble Oil &
Refining Company, Production Research Division, Houston,
Texas, the Lewisville site materials have yielded two different
radiocarbon age determinations. These were the first to be associated with the Clovis projectile point type and, thereby, possibly with the Llano Complex (Sellards, 1952).

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

69

Primarily concerned with dating geologic formations of Recent alluvium and sediments, the Humble laboratory has also
handled a considerable number of archeological samples. The
first group of these has recently been published (Brannon et al.,
1957), including those from Lewisville.
Special thanks and appreciation are due to H. N. Fisk, director; C. R. Horcutt, assistant director; H. Dayton Wilde; Milton
Williams; and Weldon Whitaker, for many courtesies and invaluable services. Williams provided most of the contact work
and Whitaker personally processed the samples.
Five different carbon samples were submitted, of which the
first and fifth yielded datings.
Lewisville Sample No. 1 (Humble 0-235) occurred in place
in Square 13 of the Hearth 1 excavations as a rich pocket of
carbonized material, roughly three inches in diameter and seven
inches long, in the heavily red-burned hearth clay (Fig. 3).
This was only 20 inches from the Clovis point, likewise imbedded in the red-burned hearth clay of Square 13. Both the
charred material and the projectile point occurred at the same
level, with some of the charred matter extending a few inches
deeper into the hearth due to the angular inclination of the
pocket. E. S. Barghoorn, consulting paleobotanist for Humble,
identified the carbonized material of the sample as "fibrous
vegetable material." The date determined for this sample is
expressed as being "more than 37,000 years B.P."
Lewisville Sample No. 5 (Humble 0-248) came from the
charred remains of four small logs in Hearth 8. After the
surprising result of the first dating, Barghoorn and Whitaker
were flown to the site to select a sample of different provenience
for purposes of checking the first date. According to Barghoorn,
the charred logs were unquestionably "wood charcoal" and of
such purity that only hand-sorting and routine processing were
required for dating. Geologically, Hearth 8 should have been
contemporary with Hearth 1, as it occurred upon the same
stratigraphic surface level approximately 300 feet northeast.
A relatively continuous series of hearths and adjacent faunal
remains connected the two over the intervening area, and

70

Texas Archeological Society

Hearth 8 itself lay among several other hearths and faunal
occurrences, including White’s bison excavation, the camel skull,
the large deer antler, and the coyote jaw. The date for this
sample is likewise expressed as being" "more than 37,000 years
B.P."
The agreement of two different dating runs, based upon two
different carbon samples of different materials, from two different hearths in the site, is considered to be significant.
Essentially, both samples were beyond the effective range of
the counting apparatus, as the recorded radiations from the
samples were less than the probable error of the background
count of the machine. Hence the terminology of simply being
"more than 37,000." The "dates" are minimum expressions.
The carbon dioxide gas-counting technique is employed by
the Humble Radiocarbon Laboratory, possessing the several
advantages of increased range, smaller sample necessary, elimination of radioactive contamination, and routine removal of
carbonates by the acid bath.
Discussion of the current controversies, some supporting and
others suggesting the invalidation of the entire technique of
radiocarbon dating, is beyond the scope of this paper. A final
and conclusive settlement of the matter may be years in the
offing. In the meantime, it is well to record that large quantities
of additional charcoal from these two particular tests, plus that
from other hearths excavated later at the Lewisville site, have
been sealed and preserved for possible future cross-dating with
other laboratories. This material will be available when, and if,
advances in the technique may extend the range or improve the
method of dating.
OTHER EVIDENCES OF EARLY MAN IN THE
LEWISVILLE REGION
Sites and finds of Early Man at several places in the region
in which the Lewisville site lies suggest the presence of man at
the same geologic level and with very similar paleontological
associations. These occurrences, inconclusive as each may be in

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

71

its own right, serve to demonstrate that the Lewisville Site is
not an isolated instance floating in a geographica! vacuum.
Lagow Sand Pit (Fig. 9, No. 2)
The "Lagow Sand Pit Man" is a fossilized partial human
skeleton recovered by Ellis W. Shuler, of the Southern Methodist University Department of Geology, in 1920. These remains
occurred in a large sand pit, the Lagow Sand Pit, just east of
the present State Fair Grounds in Dallas. The pit has since
been refilled, and is today occupied by the locomotive roundhouse of the Texas & Pacific Railroad. The early date of the
find, in terms of the development of American archeology, is

undoubtedly responsible for the undeserved obscurity of this
important discovery.
O{ great importance for this paper is the geologic assessment
of Lagow. As described by Shuler (1923), the Lagow Sand Pit
was excavated into the Trinity River terrace that stands some
70 feet above present stream-grade. This fact can be proved
by reference to the present-day Dallas City Plan Commission
maps, which have accurate five-foot contour control. The terrace
is thereby identified as the Pemberton Hill-Lewisville (T-2)
terrace discussed in the geologic section of this report. To further demonstrate this correlation, Lagow lies on the west bank
of White Rock creek above its confluence with the main Trinity
and its present, refilled location, is located between the 445 and
450 contour lines; while the present elevation of Pemberton Hill
itself the type location of the T-2 terrace--is 446 feet, on the
opposite (east) side of White Rock creek and only a mile downstream.
Further, the terrace of Elm Fork which includes the Lewisville site has been cited as the Pemberton Hill equivalent of the
T-2 on this major tributary. Thus the Trinity system T-2 is
today called the Pemberton Hill-Lewisville terrace.
Again referring to the work of Shuler, the section at Lagow
matches those of both Pemberton Hill and Lewisville, with the
provenience of the human remains seemingly in the Upper
Shuler formation of the terrace sequence, precisely as the occurrence of the Early Man evidences at the Lewisvitle site. Shuler’s
description of the formation at Lagow bearing the human remains is as follows: "... sandy clay with light calcareous segregations [nodules?] and streaks [soft caliche?]. Texture . . .
varies. Color yellow." The writers have personally studied the
residual exposures at the Lagow locality, and confirm the presence of a typical Upper Shuler sequence, including an unmistakable Upper Shuler yellow sandy clay. In addition, the Lagow
Man bones today, apparently having never been thoroughly
cleaned, still exhibit yellow sandy clay in hollows and crevices,
indistinguishable from materials on similar uncleaned animal
bones from the Upper Shuler at both Lewisville and Pemberton
Hill.

73

The obvious fossilization of the Lagow Man bones is quite
comparable to that exhibited in animal specimens from both
Lewisville and Pemberton Hill. No human remains of later geologic provenience in the region demonstrate such a degree of
fossilization. This is yet another confirmation of Shuler’s observations. An example of the degree of fossilization is the
chemical analysis of the human bones in relation to those of
C¢melops, from the same stratum, that Shuler supervised in

George Grant MacCurdy examined the specimens and reported as follows: "The human bones from Dallas comprise
segments of the right and left femur, right and left tibia, and
right fibula; also the left horizontal ramus of the lower jaw
and several fragments of the calotte. All presumably belong to
one individual, a large adult male of the modern type. This is
about all one could say without having in hand more of the
skeleton." The skeletal material is illustrated here in Fig. I0.
No artifacts accompanied the Lagow find, so far as is known.
Alfred S. Lull (1921) identified the following fauna from the
same stratum (i.e., the Upper Shuler formation): antelope
(Tetrameryx shuleri); mammoth (Elephas columbi) ; camel
(Camelops huerfanensis dallasi); bison (large, but non-specific) ; and deer (Odocoileus species). Al! are general Late Pleistocene forms in the area, of which only Tetrameryx does not
also occur at Lewisville.
With the positive geologic correlation here proposed for Lewisville and Lagow, the radiocarbon datings at Lewisville assume
an added significance, if valid. The dates should also equate, approximately, with the Lagow skeleton; if this is true, the "Lagow Sand Pit Man" may well be one of the very earliest exam-

ples of human remains in the Western Hemisphere. Whether
or not Lagow man also made Clovis points, as at Lewisville, is
a moot question, scientifically unprovable at present. However,
the presence of ~wo different types of man at so early a date,
only 30 miles apart, and geologically contemporaneous, would
be rather remarkable in view of the otherwise sparse evidence
of Early Man at such a level.
Pemberton Hill (Fig. 9, No. 3)
Located at the corner of Loop 12 highway and Pemberton
Hill road in southeast Dallas, Pemberton Hill lies on the east
side of White Rock creek near its confluence with the valley of
the main Trinity. This is approximately one mile downstream
from Lagow and some 30 miles from Lewisville.
In the section on geology and the immediately foregoing discussion of Lagow Sand Pit, it has been demonstrated that Pemberton Hill is directly correlated with both Lewisville and Lagow
in terms of such factors as geologic section, terrace identification, and height above stream grade. A product of extensive
gravel and sand working over many years, with consequent
erosion of the pit walls and slopes, the site presents a striking
appearance comparable in every particular to the Lewisville site.
Aside from its important geologic interest, Pemberton Hill
has attracted the attention of the writers for the past five years
because of the large numbers of fossil animal bones eroding
from the Upper Shuler formation at the site. Mammoth, horse,
and large bison are unquestionably present, although the collections have not been submitted for final identification.
tn November, 1956, a broken center-section of a spear point
or knife blade (Fig. 11, B) was discovered definitely in place
at the site, in an Upper Shuler formation fil! of a channel-cut
in the underlying Lower Shuler sands. Despite the commercial
removal of much of the overlying deposits, the artifact was still
some six feet below the present, disturbed surface, and solidly
imbedded in Upper Shuler material, rather obviously in its
lowest layer since the cut containing the Upper Shuler was intrusive into the underlying Lower Shuler sands. The writers

76

Texas ArcheoIogical Society

also observed tiny flecks of charcoal in the immediate vicinity
of the find at the time of discovery.
Of an opaque white flint, the center-section could well have
been from a Clovis type projectile point, but above the short
fluting, as no indication of fluting is present in the fragment.
Certainly the chipping, edges, and cross-section do not belie this
possibility. It is also quite possible that it is a center-section
from a knife blade, rather well made.
In January, 1957, two amateur paleontologists of Dallas, Bob
H. Slaughter, Jr., and Laith Starrett, found a second artifact
at Pemberton Hill. These two investigators had been attracted
to the site by the fossil bone occurrences and were shown the
location of the center-section find, with cautions to watch for
any other human evidences. Their discovery was a large, rather
boldly flaked, flint blade (Fig. 11, C) just exposed in the base
of a small gully. This was higher in the Upper Shuler formation at the site than the find-spot of the specimen found by the
writers. It was on the eroded slopes of an undisturbed remnant
of the original terrace, near the spot where the somewhat disarticulated remains of a horse had previously been excavated
by the writers. Nevertheless, the artifact was found within 18
inches of the head of the gully, and hence could not possibly
have washed down from a greater distance. It was still fourfifths buried when discovered and may well have been exposed
actually in place.
At this location, the blade was found at a depth of 10 feet
below the contact line of the Upper Shuler and the overlying
Richards formation. At Lewisville this would be at about the
level of Layer 5. But at Lewisville the Lower Shuler was preserved in much greater thickness to the east of the site, with a
definite erosional slope to the west, and with a consequently
reduced thickness of Upper Shuler to the east and increased
section to the west. In like manner, at Pemberton Hill, the
Lower Shuler is preserved in greater thickness in the area of
the Slaughter-Starrett find, sloping off towards the location of
the center-section discovery; as a matter of fact, the Lower
Shuler is only a few inches beneath the Slaughter-Starrett find
location, suggesting that here, again, the human evidence is

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

77

essentially near the base of the Upper Shuler deposition. All
this is in close agreement with the conditions at Lewisville.
The artifact is apparently a combination scraper and fleshing
knife. At the top, as illustrated, is what appears to be an intentionally-fashioned angular cutting edge. The specimen is
made from a fossiliferous gray flint commonly encountered in
the Edwards Plateau region of Texas, especially along the Brazos River.
Thus, two artifacts of human manufacture--and there seems
to be no possibility whatsoever, in the particular case of Pemberton Hill, of confusion with later occupations at the site, since
none have been found--occur in the same geologic situation and
with paleontological associations very similar to those at Lewisville and Lagow Sand Pit. Unlike Lewisville, however, no evidence of a fire-burned hearth has yet been observed, although a
few charcoal flecks accompanied the center-section artifact. In
addition, three flint flakes have been recovered in place in the
Upper Shuler at Pemberton Hill.
Hickory Creek Below Denton (Fig. 9, No. 4)
Some 10 miles upstream from Lewisville, on the north side
of Hickory Creek in Denton County, a short distance downstream from the U. S. Highway 377 bridge, is yet another Early
Man location of simi]ar date.
Here again is a typical T-2 (Pemberton Hill-Lewisville) terrace, penetrated by gravel pits, that has yielded an extensive
fossil fauna, as well as evidences of man, all eroding from an
unquestionable Upper Shuler formation exposure.
We can avoid unnecessary detail by saying that the geologic
and paleontological situation is identical with that at Lewisville.
In 1951-52, North Texas State College of Denton, Texas, excavated an articulated skeleton of Elephas columbi in the base
of a five-foot gully cut into the Upper Shuler at the site. Since
then, the writers have recovered evidence of a large bison,
camel, land turtle (probably Testudo species), and a gastropod
of Anguispira affiliation, from the site. All seem identical to
specimens from Lewisville.

as yet not identified. This combination of occurrences again
demonstrates the undoubted presence of man during Upper
Shuler times on the Upper Trinity drainage system.
Oak Cliff Clovis Point (Fig. 9, No. 5)
Late in 1955, E. S. Moore, of the Oak Cliff section of Dallas,
telephoned the writers that he had found an "interesting arrowhead" in some fill-dirt delivered commercially. Upon investigation, the "arrowhead" turned out to be a skillfully chipped Clovis projectile point (Fig. 11, A).
While it is indeed unfortunate that, despite a search, the exact
gravel pit which yielded this Clovis point could not be located,
it is still most suggestive that such an artifact was delivered
locally in Dallas. Based upon the writers’ experience, it is highly
likely that the pit of provenience is within 20 miles of the find,
undoubtedly in Dallas County. Because of commercial factors, a
further distance is not probable. However, the pit is unknown,
and no exact analysis of the find location is possible. Nevertheless, the occurrence seems again to prove the presence of "Clovis
man" in the area.
The point is of a semi-transluscent yellow flint. It is a true
Clovis point of the finest, thinnest workmanship and fluting.
Henderson County Stone Heads (Fig. 9, No. 6)
Sellards’ three remarkable stone heads from gravel pits near
Malakoff, Henderson County, Texas (Sellards, 1952), add to the
Early Man evidences on the Upper Trinity. Occurring in the
same T-2 terrace of the main Trinity River, some 80 miles
downstream, these three carved sandstone concretions were
found at the disconformity separating the Hill gravels and the
Lower Shuler sands. Whether they pertain to the final stage of
the Hill gravel deposition, the minor erosional hiatus intervening, or the base of the overlying Lower Shuler sands--all
three equally possible in a geological sense--is immaterial. In
any of these cases they seem to record the presence of man in
the stream system at a very early period, even earlier than

80

Texas Archeological Society

Lewisville, and at a cultural level capable at least of primitive
sculpture. That three different stone heads occurred, in two
different gravel pits, makes the finds all the more remarkable.
CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION
Small groups of people, perhaps no more than single family
units, apparently visited the Lewisville site area from time to
time over an undetermined number of years during the active
period of occupation. From the evidence of the Clovis type projectile point, these groups may represent the people responsible
for the Llano Complex of Sellards (1952). If not, they certainly
must have been contemporaries of the Llano Complex people to
have acquired such a point at so early a time.
In general, the hearths are small and scattered, with only two
(Nos. 1 and 4) possessing any real size and displaying unmistakable indications of re-use for repeated fires. This fact, coupled with the scanty flint-work recovered, suggests brief itinerant camping, with possibly only one or two fires built at a
time, rather than continued occupation by a sizable group. If
the site had been occupied for any length of time or by larger
numbers of people, more cultural debris could be expected. Additionally, with hearths occcurring upon four different levels in
the Upper Shuler formation, it is possible to visualize the site
as representing a series of such sporadic visits over a number
of years. Obviously the most popular period was when Layer 2
existed as the site surface, since most of the hearths and material derive from this zone; but the site was also definitely
occupied both before and after this period.
How long a span of time this occupation covered is impossible
to state. Enough time did elapse for floods to deposit four layers
of the Upper Shuler formation, varying in thickness from six
inches to four feet, with sufficient dry time between floodings
to form caliche nodules of considerable size beneath each of the
successive surfaces. Certainly the time of occupation must be
reckoned in terms of hundreds of years, if not thousands.
Perhaps the site was a favored hunting station in the Fall
months, briefly visited year after year. The large quantities of

Hearths and Artifacts of Eo~rly Man Near Lewisville, Texas

81

burned hackberry seeds, encountered in practically all hearths
at all levels, suggest a seasonal occupation in the Fall. These
seeds do not mature in the area today until late August. The
first good "norther" of the Fall, a strong north wind usually
occurring in the October 15-November 15 period, blows the
seeds to the ground, whereupon hordes of grackles and starlings
descend upon the area for a few weeks and noisily clean up the
crop. That men frequented the area most probably in the earlier
portion of "prime hackberry season" is suggested by the number of immature seed hulls found, though by far the majority
are mature specimens.
Such an August or September timing agrees well with the
early historic records of buffalo hunting in this region. The East
Texas Caddo maintained a custom, later adopted by the first
white settlers, of going west in the Fall (usually September)
to the Elm Fork of the Trinity to hunt buffalo and lay in a
winter supply of meat. This was occasioned by the annual migrations of the great buffalo herds on the plains, which in the
early Fall brought large numbers of bison this far south and
east. The region seems always to have been more or less at the
dividing point between the prairies to the west and the forested
country to the east, hence similar game conditions may have
prevailed long ago.
However, there also is an indication that the Lewisville site
was visited in the Spring as well, as testified by the burned
bird egg shells in both Hearths 4 and 6.
With a climate as warm as, or warmer than, today, the countryside must have presented a view of rolling, grassy prairies
on the uplands and with timber growth along the stream valleys, much as today. The valley of the Elm Fork of the Trinity
could not possibly have had its present’relief, for the floodplain
was silted up and stood some 70 feet above today’s stream grade.
The valley must have been wide and shallow, stretching from
one to three miles across. Much of this broad floodplain may
have been timbered, including, at least, goodly numbers of hackberry trees.

82

Texas Archeological Society

Deer, black bear, probably wolves, cottontail rabbits, raccoons,
and other forest forms inhabited the timbered bottoms. On the
adjacent prairies the American horse, camel, bison, mammoth,
coyote, prairie dogs, and other plains types were present. The
actual stream channel was operating at low gradient, as evidenced by the choked floodplain. The quiet water of cut-off
oxbows is suggested by one type of river mussel found in the
site.
In the more moist periods, associated with the intermittent
floods that continued to deposit layers of the Upper Shuler yellow sandy silt, the area covered by the timber growth of the
bottoms probably expanded, and the forest animals harbored
therein increased. In the dry times, the timber probably retreated toward the very banks of the stream channel, and generally withdrew downstream, while prairie conditions and fauna
encroached upon the floodplain. If caliche could form in quantity in the floodplain itself from time to time, the vegetation
cover on the upland prairies must have been sparse indeed
during the dry extremes. This would have had the effect of concentrating the animal life of the region along the stream valleys.
From the food evidences, Lewisville man must have pursued
an economy very similar to that of the African Bushman today
he ate anything and everything he could get his hands on!
The great diversity in the large game species found at the site
shows no noteworthy specialization towards preferring any
single type of animal. Although the horses and deer are the
most numerous of the large forms, they do not dominate the
fauna and their numbers may mean only that they were easier
to capture. The wide variety of large food animals possibly suggests that no species was present in the region ~in true herd
numbers at the time of occupation, so that the hunters were
content with a camel here, a horse there, and so on, as encountered by chance.
The great numbers of terrapins, and the small animals, also
suggest that large game was not readily available. On the other
hand, this collection may simply be the result of women and
children foraging about the campsite while the hunters were off
for several days after bigger game.

Certainly the hackberry seed was a much-utilized item of diet.
The use of this seed as food has a long history with mankind,
extending back to Peking Man in the caves at Chou-kou-tien,
and having also been found in abundance in the Frontier Cu!ture Complex in Nebraska (Holder and Wike, 1949). When
more occupational campsites (in contrast to the common "kill"
sites) of Early 5~[an in North America are found, the hackberry
seed can very probably be expected as a companion.
The artifact assemblage of spear point, crude chopper, hammerstone, and flake-scraper, does not suggest an impressive or
highly developed cultural level. All of these implements could
be, and probably were, associated with the acquisition of food
and its preparation, as well as being involved in the manufacture of a few tools, mainly weapons. This circumstance is in
accord with the narrow variety of implements recorded from all
other Clovis sites. Of course, one does not see the perishable
items, but bone objects would be expected to have survived in
the light of the large amount of refuse bone preserved by the
caliche-charged soil. That no bone artifacts were found is of
note, in view of the finding of bone points and tools in the Clovis
level at Blackwater Draw. However, no other Clovis site has
yet yielded any bone work, so perhaps Lewisville is not unduly
exceptional in this respect.
The radiocarbon datings are most interesting. If valid, they
strongly reinforce the geologic assignment of the occupational
period to at least a major interstadial of the Wisconsin prior
to the last cycle of glacial advances. "More than 37,000 years
old" is certainly a surprising date; but then, no Clovis site had
been dated by C-14 previous to the work at Lewisville. Even
disregarding the datings, a considerable antiquity for the site is
still to be supposed in view of the evidence of the geology, fauna,
and the Clovis point.
The radiocarbon dates seem to imply a long period of little
cultural change in America--a not impossible circumstance if
one views the living Australian Blackfellow and South African
Bushman as examples of cultural conservatism among primitive
peoples. Their patterns of existence can be but little different
from those of their ancestors of 20,000-40,000 years ago.

In the 1955 Seminar on "Functional and Evolutionary Implications of Community Patterning" (Beardsley et al., 1956),
certain rather apt descriptions of the Lewisville situation occur
in the earliest category, Free Wandering. The writers have
lifted from context and italicized to provide emphasis to key
statements :
"Ethnographic criteria: . . . divided into small family units
that move about continuously and without any territorial considerations .... Material equipment is minimal . . . made as
needed and discarded after use. There is no social organization
beyond the family, and families come together only on rare and
brief occasions .... "
"Archeological criteria: Ideally, Free Wandering should be
attested by a very wide distribution of artifact types that are
simple in nature and limited in variety. In general, such remains
should represent the initial occupation of any given region ....
Since camps were moved frequently, evidence of occupation may
be undetectable or at best scanty, consisting of ash or charcoal,
split or burned animal bones, and a few artifacts."
"Archeological examples: . . . In the New World, the distribution of Clovis points over the greater part of North America
may provide a comparable example .... "
Lewisville seems to fit this definition rather well. The successive revisitation of the site, suggestive of the next stage, Restricted Wandering, does not vitiate against the comparison if
climatic and ecologic conditions remained relatively stable, as
could be expected in an interstadial period.
Comparisons
Because of geological provenience and other considerations,
only the Clovis finds at Dent, Colorado, and at Blackwater Draw,
New Mexico, seem readily comparable to Lewisville.
At Dent, the prime factors seem to be the occurrence of Clovis
points two formations deep into the Kersey terrace (T-2),
whereas Folsom points occur at plow-depth upon the surface of
this terrace downstream (Wormington, 1949). In like manner,

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Mc~n Near Lewisville, Texas

85

the Lewisville Clovis point occurs deep within the second formation, while a Plainview point has occurred at Seagoville,
downstream from Lewisville, seemingly in place at spade-depth
on the surface of the same T-2 or Pemberton Hill-Lewisville
terrace (elsewhere Plainview is dated by radiocarbon at no more
than 1,000 years younger than Folsom). It is obvious that the
terraces of the South Platte in Colorado result directly from
alpine glaciers, whereas those of the Upper Trinity derive from
eustatic fluctuation of sea-level; but the two features must be
essentially contemporaneous with deglaciations. Melt-water from
a receding alpine glacier eventually bursts through the impounding terminal moraine and floods downstream, dropping its
silt load as a floodplain deposit, later to be entrenched and left
as terraces. Likewise a non-glaciated Coastal Plain stream such
as the Trinity would silt up its floodplain in a period of deglaciation as the ice melted and sea-leve! rose; this would in turn
be trenched and remnants left as terraces in any succeeding
ice-advance with consequent lowered sea-level and thereby increased gradient.
Blackwater Draw presents an unimpeachable stratigraphic
sequence with Clovis points occurring below Folsom points and
even higher Plainview-like "Yuma" forms (Sellards, 1952).
Here the major separation consists of an apparent eolian erosional disconformity which partially or totally removed the
"brown sand wedge," depending upon the specific location, and
may even have cut down the Clovis-bearing "speckled sand"
member. If caliche formed as far east as Lewisville, eolian erosion is entirely possible at Blackwater Draw at the same time
period. That Clovis points are associated at Blackwater Draw
with mammoth, horse, and large bison--whereas the later occupations are seemingly associated solely with large bison--and
that the Lewisville site also provides a Clovis point associated
with mammoth, horse, large bison, camel and other species, is
very probably significant.
Questions and Discussion
So much for what appear to the writers to be the most reasonable and logical conclusions about the Lewisville site as af-

86

Texas Archeological Society

forded by the several lines of evidence. Alternative interpretations are of course always possible, but those presented here
appear most probai)le.
There are two important questions which remain to be discussed. First, does the Clovis point really pertain to the site?
Second, are the radiocarbon datings valid?
Had there been no C-14 date; had any such date been more on
the expected order of 12,000-20,000 years; or had the writers
repudiated the dating results, possibly suggesting some means
of contamination, there probably would be little question about
the point itself. While the artifact assemblage is sparse, a single
Clovis point would still be rather generally accepted as identifying the occupation. After all, five of the eight Clovis sites (Angus, Dent, Miami, McLean, and Lewisvi!le) yielded a total of
but eight points, an average of less than two per site.
Similarly, if more Clovis points accompanied the find say,
perhaps, three or more there would also be no question of
identifying the occupation.
A number of possibilities present themselves. Perhaps the
point was introduced into the site in some manner at a later
date than the occupation of the hearths, and thus does not actually pertain to that occupation. Or the site may not be a "site"
at all, but a result of some natural phenomenon, into which a
Clovis point was accidentally intruded. This latter possibility
might also explain the unexpected C-14 datings, since they then
would represent some ancient natural occurrence and not date
any human occupation.
To begin with, Clovis points are extremely rare along the
Upper Trinity, making any manner of intrusion a remarkable
coincidence. The Dallas Archeological Society maintains a collection of more than 175,000 cataloged specimens from the region, of which but eight (including the specimen from Lewisville) are Clovis projectile points. This circumstance does not,
in itself, rule out the possibility of intrusion at Lewisville, but
does indicate what an unusual coincidence an intrusion of a
Clovis point would have to be.

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

The site was revealed in 1950 by the removal of some 20 feet
of overburden by bulldozers. The erosion of the exposed pit floor
and walls in the succeeding seven years materially altered the
surfaces, cutting both small and deep gullies, and removing a
good deal of the flat surface deposits by sheet wash. The writers
estimate that perhaps as much as a foot of earth had been so
removed above Hearth 1 where the Clovis point was found. No
spoil dumps are in evidence about the pit, as this was a borrow
pit, excavated to secure fill dirt that was hauled away for the
dam, unlike the procedure in gravel operations. The presence
of the hearth itself was unsuspected by the writers until February, 1956, following a rain. As the writers had actually walked
across the spot only a month before, without noticing the least
indication of a hearth, and as the hearth was found within three
days of the only rain during the intervening period (it being
customary to search the site for fresh erosion on weekends after
each rain), Hearth 1 can only have shown the faint reddish
tinges then apparent for some three days previous to its discovery. So little was showing that it was quite a surprise upon
excavation to find that it measured eight feet across.
At the time of discovery no visible disturbance could be noted.
However, the six years of rainwash, since the bulldozer work,
might have obliterated minor surface disturbance from such a
source.

Two powerful arguments against the possibility of disturbance by the bulldozers are the facts that the point lay imbedded
in the red-burned clay of the hearth, and was encrusted with
caliche. Even after cleaning, the red clay color can still be discerned in the tiny flake fractures on both sides of the point.
Thus the bulldozer would have to acquire a Clovis point, an
unusual accident in itself in the region, and then by fortuitous
circumstance move it, without breaking or chipping (no fresh
scars are apparent), exactly to the location of Hearth 1 and
there implant it; and all this would have to occur at the very
close of the pit excavation so as to leave the specimen in the
floor of the borrow pit.
Even so, the bulldozer would have had to acquire the point
from somewhere in the immediate vicinity, actually within the

88

Texas Archeological Society

pit itself; this necessity is heightened by the catiche encrustation
on the point. Caliche is rare this far east in the Southwest, and
along the Upper Trinity it occurs in no formation later than
the Upper Shuler and Richards Formations of the Lewisville
terrace. These two formations are exactly what constitute the
some 20 feet of overburden removed at the site. Both Krieger
and Sellards viewed the point before the caliche was removed
in cleaning.
Thus the possibility of intrusion through bulldozer excavation
is exceedingly faint.
Burrowing rodents are another well known means of intrusion of artifacts into older strata. Evidence of these animals
about the site occurs in the form of two different sizes of crotovinas, each filled with a cast of caliche. The large crotovinas,
coupled with the prairie dog remains (both burned, in the
hearths, and unburned about the fireplaces) suggest prairie dog
holes. The small ones, coupled with the presence of raccoon
(again both in and out of the hearths) suggest crayfish holes
during the more moist cycles. Raccoons depend heavily upon
crayfish in their diet.
In the excavation of Hearth 1 and the adjacent five-foot
squares, a number of such caliche-filled holes were encountered,
quite distinct in their whitish calcareous color as contrasted to
the surrounding red-burned clay of the hearth and the yellow
clay of the adjacent surfaces. These holes were plotted on the
excavation graph, as the diggers were especially looking for
possible post hole evidences. None of the caliche-filled holes were
near the projectile point, except for a small filling barely an
inch in diameter, some six inches away. This hole, by its very
size, was either a crayfish or root hole, rather than a prairie
dog hole. The point would have had difficulty moving through
it, even in vertical position. Furthermore, the point was six
inches away in apparently undisturbed red-burned clay, and
lying horizontal, flat upon its side. There seems little chance
that it reached its final position via the small hole.
In addition, the various crotovinas and!or root hole fillings
were not observed to extend through any of the observed "lay-

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Ma,n Near Lewisville, Texas

89

er" surfaces of the Upper Shuler yellow sandy clay. None of
these multiple temporary surfaces is farther from the next
above or below than about four feet. Hence even if rodent transportation were involved, it could scarcely derive from farther
than the next layer surface, in the same general formation.
Again, the rodents would encounter the difficulty already
mentioned, of acquiring a Clovis point at all in the region, and
would be the unconscious agents of a remarkable coincidence if
they put it into a human occupation hearth.
Possible "planting" of the point by parties unknown, to perpetrate a hoax, seems unreasonable as matters stand. No one
even knew the hearth existed until February, 1956; only four
people had seen the location prior to excavation, so far as the
writers know, and general knowledge even of the site itself did
not spread unti! the actual finding of the point in the excavation.
It will be recalled that no visible disturbance was evident prior
to excavation. If, miraculously, someone did manage to insert
the point without leaving visible evidence of disturbance, he
would also have needed to know, somehow, where the hearth
was, and then would have to be an astute enough student of the
area to have rubbed red-burned clay into the flake fracture and
to have possessed or faked convincingly the caliche encrustation.
The caliche crust almost removes the matter of intentional intrusion from the realm of possibility, as few people other than
the writers even know such material exists in the region. Only
a year or so ago a prominent local geologist stated to a visiting
one in the writers’ presence that "caliche doesn’t exist this far
east."
Frankly, the only parties with sufficient knowledge of the site
prior to excavation, with enough background information on
the archeology and geology of the area, and with the opportunity to convincingly pull off such a hoax, are the writers themselves. In this respect let it be quickly stated that had they done
so, in the light of the controversial developments since the announcement of the unexpected radiocarbon dates, at least a
second Clovis point would have been arranged to be "found" in
one of the additional hearths! Much hard digging was done in

90

Texas Archeological Society

107-degree weather the following summer in an honest attempt
to alleviate the paucity of artifacts.
In short, intrusion appears a highly remote possibility and
the point must have been in place as found.
The possibility that the burned hearth areas were created by
natural agencies -forest fires, burning tree stumps, lightningstrikes, and so forthrather than by man can be disposed of
without even considering the Clovis point. The heterogeneous
fauna found burned in the hearths includes plains types
camel, horse, bison, prairie dog, etc. ; forest forms--deer, wolf,
raccoon, cottontail rabbit, "deep woodland" snails, etc.; and
actual stream denizens--river mussels, fish, and lizard or amphibian. None of the possible natural phenomena named above
could easily combine such diverse groups into such small, specific locations as the individual hearths. No traces of anything
resembling a burned root hole have been observed, and rather
than looking like stump holes, the hearths are in the form of
more or less bowl-shaped pits, some deeper than others. A forest
fire could scarcely be expected to burn yellow clay a dark red 22
inches deep at Hearth 1 and 36 inches deep at Hearth 4, and
not even scorch the intervening surface between, all at the same
level.
Moreover, such a phenomenon would have had to occur repeatedly within a small, limited area such as the site encloses,
upon each successive layer surface as the deposition of the
Upper Shuler continued. Otherwise, how is one to explain three
hearths at the Layer 1 surface, 13 at the Layer 2 surface, a
single hearth on the Layer 3 surface, and four more at the Layer
5 surface? Natural causes seem beyond reasonable credulity.
Regarding the validity of the radiocarbon datings, the writers
are not in a position to discuss alternatives, not being specialists
and not even having good backgrounds in nuclear physics and
chemistry. However, certain observations from the circumstances
at the site itself, and from the literature, can be offered as bearing upon the problem.
Justified questions concerning the datings divide quickly into
specific questions about the site samples themselves, and into

Hearths and Artifacts of Early Man Near Lewisville, Texas

general questions about the whole method of radiocarbon age
determination.
Admittedly the datings were a surprise both to the Humble
Laboratory and to the writers themselves. However, prior to
Lewisville, geologic estimates had been the only guides in thinking, and it is well proven that an erosional hiatus or disconformity can represent an indeterminate length of time. In addition, the carbon dioxide technique, employed by Humble, has
nearly doubled the range of radiocarbon dating over the earlier,
solid-carbon method; thus a number of previous datings, particularly those of a geological nature, are now obsolete and
merely indicative of having fallen beyond the effective, accurate
range of the earlier technique. And finally, the datings on Santa
Rosa Island, off Southern California, from human occupation
hearths have also recently demonstrated that man of some nature was present in North America as long ago as "more than
37,000 years," similar to the dates for Lewisville (Krieger,
1956, and personal communication).
On the other hand, many radiocarbon dates have been disproven as having been mis-identified, mis-labeled, contaminated
in one way or another, or the implications incorrectly interpreted. The technique is still in its relative infancy, with much
improvement yet to be expected.
In the specific case of the Lewisville samples, little doubt can
be honestly expressed as to the applicability and handling of the
two samples dated by Humble. The first, from Hearth 1, was
from "charred, fibrous vegetable material" only 20 inches from,
and in "tight" association with, the Clovis point. Realizing full
well that they were playing with scientific dynamite, after the
first shocking date, Humble flew Barghoorn and Whitaker to
Dallas to select carefully a second samplefrom another source
and another materialto check the first run. When the "wood
charcoal" from Hearth 8, some 300 feet away but on exactly the
same level as Hearth 1, produced the same result as the first
sample, Wilde declared the evidence to be "overwhelming" and
released the dates. Very special pains were taken with this
second sample.

If, indeed, the hearths are the result of human occupation,
a matter discussed above, then only questions about the general
method remain.
Critics of the technique, who do not deny its overall potential
but debate certain individual datings, usually point up possible
mis-identification or correlation, and contamination of the sample in some manner. While some might doubt the geologic correlations at Lewisville, and a few might still suspect the Clovis
point occurrence, the main focus of thinking will probably be
towards the possible "contamination" theory of the carbon
samples.
An important point deserves reiteration here: it is far easier
to contaminate so as to make the date younger than it is to
make it older; thus the very age suggested by the Lewisvitle
samples appears to argue for their validity. For example, in
experiments of the Lamont Geological Laboratory it was found
that the artificial addition of only 5% of modern carbon would
reduce the apparent C-14 age of a 30,000 year-old sample by as
much as nearly 8,000 years (Broecker and Kulp, 1956). Conversely, the artificial addition of dead carbon in the amount of
50% to any sample would only increase its apparent C-14 age
by a constant error of plus-5,200 years. Referring to Broecker
and Kulp (ibid.), Figure 4, this would suggest that for the
Lewisville dates to have been contaminated "older," from the expected age to the observed results, the samples must have been
replaced by dead carbon to the extent of nearly 95 %.
Considerable recent discussion has centered upon the possible
ion-exchange of organic C-14 with dead carbon in CaCO~ in
groundwater solution. Broecker and Kulp rather discount this
possibility in specimens after the CO~ cycle is interrupted by the
death of the organism, citing particularly examples of the Copenhagen Laboratory’s results from three samples taken from
the same Allerhd horizon in one site. As cited, the three datings
overlap each other in complete compatibility, and agree with
other European datings for the Allerhd interval. Most importantly, the organic C-14 of the wood and lake mud samples
agrees nicely with the CaCO:~ content of the lake marl, suggest-

ing that little, if any, interchange has occurred, in the last
10,000 years.
These authorities also observe that "low-growing plants in a
caliche or heavily carbonate soil"--which Lewisville undoubtedly possessed may be deficient in C-14 to the extent of even
20 %, giving an undue age determination of a constant nature
of plus 1,800 years. This is immaterial on a specimen of extreme
age.
Therefore, in the light of present knowledge limitations, the
Lewisville dates apparently survive all tests. Certainly, in the
carbon dioxide method, all existing carbonates are removed by
the initial acid bath; this was graphically demonstrated when
another Lewisville sample, of charred hackberry seeds, literally
disappeared in the acid, after laborious hours of collecting.
Obviously, the seeds were mainly CaCQ casts, whereas the
dated samples of charcoal were able to survive the bath.
No one will deny the presence of a heavy concentration of
caliche in the Upper Shuler formation at Lewisville. Whether
or not this evidence of groundwater migration of CaCQ is significant in the matter of affecting radiocarbon samples is a moot
question at present. Broecker and Kulp appear to feel that this
factor is not significant.
The recent C-14 date of some 20,000 years ago obtained by
Wendorf at the Midland site (Wendorf, personal communication) is also pertinent to the problem. Midland has been demonstrated as being stratigraphicatty lower than the Folsom
horizon at the site (Wendorf et al., 1955), yet the discoverers
believe (personal communication) that it is not as old as Clovis.
If, then, Folsom is on the order of 10,000 years in age, Midland
is 20,000, and is older than Folsom as expected, Clovis must be
of an even greater antiquity than 20,000. Following this line of
thought, Midland might seem to help partially fill the tremendous gap between Lewisville and Folsom. However, this latest
C-14 date from Midland, which is presumed to be most reliable
since it was provided from more than ample carbon samples in
contrast to the ealier attempts to date the organic remnants in
partially fossilized bone, is subject to the same carbonate con-

tamination questions discussed for Lewisville. At Midland, the
20,000-year-old sample was extracted from carbonized organic
animal grease drippings which had been sealed inside the caliche
rock hearthstones.
As for a complete repudiation of the entire radiocarbon method, for many reasons a discussion of this matter is completely
beyond the capabilities of the writers. It may be mentioned that
most, if not all, of the proofs so far advanced for the C-14
technique appear to be generally acceptable.
The Lewisville site is far more important for its implications,
interpretations, and associated and derived data, than for its
actual artifact finds. The faunal record is perhaps the most
complete ever reported from an Early Man site in North America, and gives a greatly extended insight into the food habits
and economy of the people who lived at the site. The radiocarbon
dates, based upon abundant charcoal (in sharp contrast to the
common situation at many Early Man sites, where either there is
no datable material at all, or else there must be a desperate
gleaning of a dating sample from meager sources) are most
challenging in the apparently great age they assign to the site.
Lastly, and most important, Lewisville provides an early site, of
previously recognized type, down off the High Plains in a geologic situation that makes possible many comparative conclusions. In the course of future archeological research, this last
fact may well turn out to be its most important contribution to
the study of the early human occupation of North America.
