ABSTRACT
In March 2009 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resource management survey of a proposed improvements to the Fairview City
Park for the City of Henderson in Rusk County, Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit #5173
was obtained and all terms of the permit were carried out. The proposed park includes
six activity areas, a parking lot, and a road totaling roughly 1.5 ha. (3.7 ac). The parking
lot and five activity areas will be in highly disturbed areas of the existing city park. The
road and a trail head will be in a stand of mixed pine and hardwood trees less than 20
years old. A visual examination and shovel testing found no historic or prehistoric
cultural resources with the project area boundaries. The absence of cultural resources
was attributed to the previous park disturbance, upland setting and distant from any
reliable sources of surface water. No artifacts were collected and no further
investigations are recommended.
DETAC is requesting concurrence with the
determination of “no effect” on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed project area.

INTRODUCTION
On 16 March 2009 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resource management survey of improvements to the Fairview City
Park for the City of Henderson, Texas in Rusk County (Figure 1). Texas Antiquities
Permit #5173 was obtained and all terms of the permit were carried out. The report was
reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission.
The proposed project focused on developing a road, a parking area, and six
activity areas. Activity areas include a concession stand, trail head, water park, pavilion,
playground, and a skate park. Of these developments, only the road and trail head are in
recently undisturbed areas; all others will be in highly disturbed areas with little to no
insitu soil. The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. The report was prepared following the short
report format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (1995a) with
modifications requested by the THC (Martin 1999).

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area includes a 780 m (2560 ft) long road and six activity areas
roughly 30 m (100 ft) in diameter except for the concession stand which will be roughly
15 m (50 ft) in diameter. Total project area is roughly 1.5 ha. (3.7 ac). The project plans
included building the activity areas and parking lot in an area already in use by the city
along with grading of the road route and constructing a paved road. Currently, the
activity areas, except for the trail head, are in level areas with exposed clay subsoil and
bedrock. The southern half of the road and trail head are in a stand of mixed hardwood
and pine trees less than 20 years old. The road was delineated with surveyor stakes at the
time of the survey.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Rusk County has been studied in numerous small surveys and larger
investigations. The small surveys have focused on oil and gas exploration, farm to
market roads by TxDOT, and rural development throughout the county by FHWA and
the TWDB, e.g., Galan and Barber (2001). The larger investigations have focused on the
Oak Hill and Martin Lake mines as well as various electric transmission and pipeline
right-of-ways, e.g., Jones et al. (1987), Glander and Bond (1986), and Nash et al. (1993).
Surveys found both prehistoric and historic resources adjacent to the floodplains on first
terraces or along the toe slopes of higher ridges. A majority of these resources are
prehistoric open campsites near year round water and on sandy knolls, tow slopes, or
ridges, e.g., 41RK214, Oak Hill Village (Rogers and Perttula 2004).
The occupation of Rusk County ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.)
to Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period (ca. 200 B.C. A.D. 800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the historic
Euro American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian period
(ca. 10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers
that consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic (7000-200
B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized approaches
toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800)
represents an increasing utilization of the environment by local groups to include a greater
reliance on cultigens, prolonged occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly
sedentary lifestyle, and the emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The
Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture (A.D. 800-1600). This
culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the tradition of the Lower
Mississippi Valley (Story 1990). Larger aggregates of people became sedentary and
constructed villages with public ceremonial areas and cemeteries found in association with
large mounds. A stratified social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level
as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). The Historic period (1680-present) describes both
the history behind the current cultural setting of the area and marks a transition from the
native populations’ domination of the area, to the European immigrants establishment of
farms, towns, and counties followed by a change to farming and ranching in the early 20th
century and the addition of industry in the later part of the 20th century (THA 2009).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were preformed in compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231,
1970), the guidelines set forth by the CTA (1995b), and the Register of Professional
Archaeologists.
The program of site evaluation was conducted in accordance with the National
Park Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) which present the guidelines for determining
eligibility of a cultural resource for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The objectives of the survey were to locate prehistoric and historic cultural
resources sites within the survey areas. If sites were found, then the investigations were
to delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, determine each site’s integrity,
and provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s potential for NRHP eligibility.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using maps and files listed on the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2009). The Site
Atlas was consulted for published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys
as well as State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP sites within or in close
proximity to the project area.
DETAC conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area. To locate sites, the
pedestrian survey relied on visual examination and shovel testing. Visual examinations
were conducted in areas with exposed soil surfaces in a continuous effort between shovel
tests at all locations with exposed surfaces. Shovel testing was conducted in accordance
with the Texas Historic Commission’s guidelines for cultural resources surveys.
According to these guidelines, project areas less than 4.0 hectares (11 acres) require a
minimum of 2 shovel test per 0.4 ha (1 acres) and linear projects require roughly one test
per 100 m (330 ft) of distance; therefore, a total of 14 shovel tests were required for the 1.4
ha (3.4 ac) parking and activity areas and the 740 m (2430 ft) road. Shovel testing included
excavating an area approximately 30 cm (12 inches) in diameter in 10 cm (4 inch) levels
down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35 inches). The excavated matrix was screened
through a 0.635 cm (0.25 inch) wire mesh screen. The depth, soil type, and color of each
shovel test were recorded along with a GPS position with 3 to 5 meter accuracy.

RESULTS
The previous investigation research found two previously recorded cultural
resources within a mile of the park, a historic district, and six previous surveys around the
city of Henderson. The closest documented archaeological site is 41RK173 approximately
110 m (1770 ft) east of the project area followed by 41RK76 roughly 350 m (1150 ft) north
of the project area. The site boundaries for 41RK173 are 500 x 300 m (1640 x 990 ft)
encompassing the toe slope and summit of a ridge overlooking Shawnee Creek (Hughs
1940). A second search of site information for 41RK173 did not reveal any additional
information (Spock 2009). Site 41RK76 was documented as an early historic pottery kiln
with no remaining buildings but a scatter of brick, stoneware, and various glazed ceramics
roughly 350 m (1150 ft) to the north-northwest of the project area (Greer 1974).
Additionally, downtown Henderson (400 m (1310 ft) northwest of the project area) was
recognized as a NRHP district. The Henderson Commercial Historic District includes 71
historic resources of Classical Revival, Art Deco, and Romanesque architecture with
periods of significance as early as 1875 to the 1930’s (THC 2009, NRHP 2009).
The closest documented archaeological surveys were conducted for FHWA in 1985
along Highway 79 from the intersection with State highway 225 southwest to a proposed
loop which was surveyed in 1987 and 1993. The survey for the loop resulted in the
documentation of 41RK195 west of the city limits. North of the city, the Texas Water
Development Board conducted two surveys for water lines in 2007; no sites were
documented. Additionally, Perttula and Nelson (2003) excavated site 41RK170, Nawi hain
Ina, roughly 2 km (1.2 miles) south of the project area. Excavations revealed a midden, pit
and post features along with Caddo artifacts on a narrow ridge overlooking the confluence
of two creeks.
Soils in the project area include Bowie very fine sandy loam and Cuthbert fine
sandy loam over the existing park area with Sacul fine sandy loam in the trees. All three
soil series consist of 20 to 25 cm (8 to 10 inches) of very fine sandy loam over clay (NRCS
2009).
Overall, the area slopes toward the southeast into deeply incised unnamed
drainages that collect into a stream along the southern border of the property (Figure 2).
The existing park area is primarily exposed subsoil and bed rock outside the baseball

Vegetation was exclusively

pasture grasses on the baseball field and mixed hardwood and pine trees with moderate to
dense understory and thick pine duff on the ground surface along the road right-of-way.
The road right-of-way will parallel an existing paved trail. The trail is a loop that extends
eastward from the east central part of the cleared area, arcs south, and then returns to the
southeast corner of the cleared area near a cell phone tower (Figure 2). Most of the area
near the trail head and proposed road south of the existing side walk was dominated by
spoil piles of soil from construction east of the project area.

This area was also

dominated by deeply incised drainages through stratified sandstone and mudstone.
A total of 24 shovel test were excavated along the road, trail head, and near the
proposed pavilion and water area where sandy soil was observed over the clay and
bedrock. Shovel testing found soil conditions similar to the soil survey with brown to
light brown sandy loam over clay with mottled clay loam in the disturbed areas. The
deepest tests were found where the road will be furthest from the park in the stand of
trees. No cultural material was observed in the shovel testing or during the surface
inspection of exposed surfaces near the parking lot and activity areas. Shovel test results
are described in Table 1.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed improvements to the Fairview city park will utilize previously
disturbed areas and a new road will parallel and existing walkway through a stand of
trees to connect a proposed trail head at the edge of existing urban development. Shovel
testing focused on the areas not visibly disturbed in the past year. Surface inspection and
shovel testing found no evidence of either prehistoric or historic period occupation.
In conclusion, the investigations did not document any cultural resources. Based
on the investigations, there is little chance of encountering cultural resources in the
project areas. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect”
on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed project area.
