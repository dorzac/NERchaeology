ABSTRACT
On April 4-8, 2011, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted cultural resource
investigations for the proposed Boys and Girls Club facility in Huntsville, northern Walker
County, Texas.
The investigations were conducted for The City of Huntsville under Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 5917. The project area of potential effect (APE) consists of a two
acre tract that will contain a 20,000 sq ft Boys and Girls Club building and associated
infrastructure construction (the location of the building within the two acre tract has not yet been
determined). The tract is located adjacent to the North Side Cemetery, which lies across 1st Street
on the west side of the project property. The tract thus falls within the Texas Historical
Commission, Archeology Division, regulations in regards to ground disturbance in proximity to
recorded cemeteries, as well as the occasional occurrence of unmarked graves outside the
currently visible boundaries of such cemeteries. The City of Huntsville therefore requested a
proposal to determine with a justifiably high level of confidence whether or not human burials are
present within the tract. This project was tailored to that objective, as well as to assessing the
presence or absence of any other class of significant archeological deposits within the subject
property.
To achieve the primary objective, mechanical excavations focused on what was designated as the
“jurisdictional initial survey area,” which consists of the 23,000 sq ft area immediately adjacent to
the 1st Street and adjacent cemetery grounds. This rectangular strip begins at the tract’s west
property line/1st Street ROW, and extends eastward for 70 ft (a distance of 70 ft is employed as
this reflects the THC Archeology Division’s mandate for cemetery surveys; i.e., unmarked graves
must be searched for on any project within 70 ft of a known cemetery). As this area represents
the area of highest probability for containing grave features (due to its proximity to the cemetery
grounds), the scope of work argued that negative results in this area could be used to suggest that
no graves are present in the remainder of the tract
An intensive pedestrian field survey of the tract was conducted, and included both surface and
subsurface (shovel test and backhoe trench) examination (Figure 4; see Appendix 1 for details).
A total of nine shovel tests were excavated. The backhoe investigations located within the
“jurisdictional initial survey area” (JISA) consisted of the mechanical excavation of a total of
approximately 3512 sq ft (ca. 0.08 acres, 326.3 m2), and included three deep trench probes.
No prehistoric or historic cultural materials or features, or any trace of grave shafts or stains or
other evidence suggesting the presence of human burials was found by the shovel tests,
mechanically excavated trench, or surface observations. Consequently, no further archeological
investigations are recommended. In the event that additional archeological deposits or features
should be encountered during construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission contacted for further consultation.

INTRODUCTION
was designated as the “jurisdictional initial
survey area,” which consists of the 23,000
sq ft area immediately adjacent to the 1st
Street and adjacent cemetery grounds
(Figure 3). This rectangular strip begins at
the tract’s west property line/1st Street
ROW, and extends eastward for 70 ft (a
distance of 70 ft is employed as this reflects
the THC Archeology Division’s mandate for
cemetery surveys; i.e., unmarked graves
must be searched for on any project within
70 ft of a known cemetery). As this area
represents the area of highest probability for
containing grave features (due to its
proximity to the cemetery grounds), the
scope of work argued that negative results in
this area could be used to suggest that no
graves are present in the remainder of the
tract.

On April 4-8, 2011, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted
cultural resource investigations for the
proposed Boys and Girls Club facility in
Huntsville, northern Walker County, Texas.
The investigations (MAC PN 10-34) were
conducted for The City of Huntsville under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5917.
The project area of potential effect
(APE) consists of a two acre tract that will
contain a 20,000 sq ft Boys and Girls Club
building and associated infrastructure
construction (the location of the building
within the two acre tract has not yet been
determined). The project area is depicted on
the Huntsville, Texas 7.5' USGS
topographic quadrangle map (Figures 1, 2).
The tract is located adjacent to the North
Side Cemetery, which lies across 1st Street
on the west side of the project property
(Figures 2, 3). The tract thus falls within the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology
Division, regulations in regards to ground
disturbance in proximity to recorded
cemeteries, as well as the occasional
occurrence of unmarked graves outside the
currently visible boundaries of such
cemeteries. The City of Huntsville therefore
requested a proposal to determine with a
justifiably high level of confidence whether
or not human burials are present within the
tract. This project was tailored to that
objective, as well as to assessing the
presence or absence of any other class of
significant archeological deposits within the
subject property.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the tract was conducted, and included
both surface and subsurface (shovel test and
backhoe trench) examination (Figure 4; see
Appendix 1 for details). A total of nine
shovel tests were excavated. The backhoe
investigations
located
within
the
“jurisdictional initial survey area” (JISA)
consisted of the mechanical excavation of a
total of approximately 3512 sq ft (ca. 0.08
acres, 326.3 m2), and included three deep
trench probes (the irregular shape of the
trench resulted from the need to maneuver
around the large number of trees located
within the tract). The field investigations
were conducted by project archeologist
Randy Ferguson and field technician
Rachael Goings. Douglas Mangum served
as the project’s principal investigator.

To achieve the primary objective,
mechanical excavations focused on what

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Branch) and 900 m to the west (Town
Branch).

Soils and Geology
Walker County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Flora and Fauna
Walker County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The county is
situated within the pine-oak subdivision of
the Austroriparian province (Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species
of the pine-oak forest subdivision as loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus
echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak
(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests
are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such
trees
as
sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia
grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water
oak (Quercus nigra), and other species of
oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly
diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandisia
usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).

The project area is depicted on sheet
32 of the Soil Survey of Walker County
(McClintock et al. 1979). Two soil types are
present in the tract, Ferris clay 1 to 5 percent
slopes (16) in the west half, and Annona
association, gently undulating (2), in the east
half. These soils are identified as somewhat
poorly drained with slow runoff.

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus
borealis,
Sciurus
niger,
Sciurus
carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys
breviceps,
Reithrodonomys
fulvescens,
Peromyscus leucopus, Oryzomys palustris,
cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat
(Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail
(Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison)
may have been present on nearby grasslands
at various times in the past (Gadus and
Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene

Climate
The modern climate of the Walker
County study area is described as hot in the
summer and cool in the winter, with uniform
rainfall throughout the year, but infrequent
snow (McClintock et al. 1979:1). Summer
temperatures average 82°F (28°C), while
winter temperatures average 51°F (11°C).
Annual precipitation averages 44 inches
(112 cm).
Hydrology
While a number of small streams
dissect the Huntsville area, no streams are
located on, or immediately adjacent to, the
project tract. The closest streams are located
approximately 500 m to the northeast (Horse

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and
faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able
to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,

fated Narváez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).
The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated Narváez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Prior
to

field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that no previously recorded archeological
sites are located in, or within the immediate
vicinity (½ km) of, the project area.

materials, including pottery and/or arrow
points.
Over the next two decades, a
number of large archeological survey
projects associated with large public work
projects, including the Honea Reservoir
(Lake Conroe; Shafer 1966, 1968), and the
Sam Houston National Forest (Shafer and
Baxter 1975; Shafer and Stearns 1975;
McNatt 1978). These projects recorded, and
in some cases, excavated, a wide range of
prehistoric sites dating form the Archaic to
Late Ceramic periods, as well as some
historic sites.
Closer to the current project area,
three investigations have been conducted at
Eastham-Thomason Park, located in north
Huntsville, approximately ¾ of a mile west
of the North Side Cemetery. The first of
these surveys, all of which were conducted
by Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
covered the entire 48 acres of the park in
1990 (Moore and Moore 1990). No sites
were recorded, though it appears to have
been at a limited, reconnaissance level, with
few shovel tests conducted. A second
survey of park property was conducted in
1999 (Moore et al. 1999). This survey
covered portions of a 100 acre expansion to
the park. A single prehistoric site, 41WA99
was identified, and recommended for
testing. The third survey within the park
was conducted in 2005, in preparation for
proposed improvements that included a dog
park, gazebo construction, and an
interpretive center (Mangum and Moore
2005). No sites were identified during this
survey.

The
first
systematic
archeological investigation in Walker
County was conducted by the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project (TASP)
during its survey of the proposed
Livingston Reservoir area in Polk, San
Jacinto, Trinity, and Walker Counties in
1961 and 1962 (Nunley 1963). This
project was an attempt to assess the
archeological potential of the region
destined to inundated by the waters of
Lake Livingston.
Members of the
Houston Archeological Society (HAS)
assisted TASP personnel in the survey.
The first recorded sites in Walker
County (41WA1-41WA7) were located
by HAS members during these efforts.
Fieldwork consisted of surface survey
and shovel testing at two sites, 41WA1
and 41WA3, and documentation of an
artifact collection from 41WA2. No
formal testing was conducted. Most of
the sites produced Late Prehistoric

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
markers are the most obvious of such
potential
shallowly
buried
artifacts.
However, other artifacts or imported objects
are often placed intentionally at cemetery
locations, or tend to be lost or discarded in
some
considerable
numbers
within
cemeteries over time. Intentionally placed
items include the grave decorations, but may
encompass materials like crushed shell or
gravel for walkways). Lost or discarded
items can include nails, pieces of pottery,
food bones, and other everyday items left by
visitors to the graves. These classes of
cemetery-associated materials both tend to
be numerous and found close to the ground
surface. They can sometimes be located by
surface observation, or in areas where the
ground surface is obscured by vegetation, by
small, shallow shovel tests without fear of
disturbing any burials. For the current
project, a systematic pedestrian survey
consisting of ground observation and shovel
testing will be conducted in order to look for
surface indications of potential grave
features and associated cemetery-related
items, as well as to prospect for potential
prehistoric sites.

The fieldwork was conducted on
March 28-April 1, 2011, and consisted of
shovel testing, backhoe trenching and visual
examination for surface exposure of cultural
materials (Figures 1, 2).
The project area of potential effect
(APE) consists of a two acre tract that will
contain a 20,000 sq ft Boys and Girls Club
building and associated infrastructure
construction (the location of the building
within the two acre tract has not yet been
determined). The project area is depicted on
the Huntsville, Texas 7.5' USGS
topographic quadrangle map (Figures 1, 2).
The tract is located adjacent to the North
Side Cemetery, which lies across 1st Street
on the west side of the project tract (Figures
2, 3, 5). The tract thus falls within the Texas
Historical
Commission,
Archeology
Division, regulations in regards to ground
disturbance in proximity to recorded
cemeteries, as well as the occasional
occurrence of unmarked graves outside the
currently visible boundaries of such
cemeteries. The City of Huntsville therefore
requested a proposal to determine with a
justifiably high level of confidence whether
or not human burials are present within the
tract. This project was tailored to that
objective, as well as to assessing the
presence or absence of any other class of
significant archeological deposits within the
subject property.

Shovel Test Excavation
A total of nine shovel tests (STs 19) were excavated. Each of the shovel tests
were excavated in 10 cm levels and screened
through ¼” mesh (Figure 4; Appendix 1),
and all were recorded and plotted on the
project map. The tests were located along
three transects, and were spaced at
approximate 30 m intervals. All the shovel
tests were able to reach the shallow ancient
(pre-Holocene) subsoil. The upper interface
of this dense clay stratum ranged in depth
from 24-55 cm below the ground surface.
No prehistoric or historic cultural materials
or features, or any evidence of human
burials were found in any of the shovel tests.

Vegetation in the project property
consisted of a dense mix of trees and
underbrush, with 0 percent surface visibility
(Figure 6). The vegetation includes mostly
mature pine with some oak, elm, yaupon,
and others. The topography gently slopes
down from west to east.
Understory
includes greenbrier and poison ivy.
Burial Location: Surface and SubSurface Survey Methodologies
The most basic burial and cemetery
location method is close observation of the
ground surface. Toppled and buried grave

Backhoe Trench Excavation
In order to definitively determine
the presence or absence of burials within the
tract,
mechanical
excavations
were

conducted within the “jurisdictional initial
survey area,” which consists of the 23,000
sq ft area immediately adjacent to the 1st
Street and the adjacent cemetery grounds
(Figures 3, 4). This rectangular strip begins
at the tract’s west property line/1st Street
ROW, and extends eastward for 70 ft (a
distance of 70 ft is employed as this reflects
the THC Archeology Division’s mandate for
cemetery surveys; i.e., unmarked graves
must be searched for on any project within
70 ft of a known cemetery). As this area
represents the area of highest probability for
containing grave features (due to its
proximity to the cemetery grounds),
negative results will be used to suggest that
no graves are present in the remainder of the
tract.

undocumented burials. Further, all of these
burial locations were identified without
impact to human remains or burial
enclosures (coffins, vaults, etc.).

The standard burial identification
subsurface survey procedure entails the
removal of a superficial layer of disturbed
soil in order to permit the identification and
recording of grave shaft locations (if any)
within the surrounding, undisturbed natural
soil.
This technique can generally be
carried out with negligible impact to the
actual graves and human remains.

BHT 1 was placed near the southern
boundary of the JISA (Figure 4). The trench
measured 2.0 m in length, 1.1 m in width,
and reached a maximum depth of 1.27 m
(Figures 7, 8). The trench cut into a
bulldozer ‘push-pile’ (most likely related to
the construction of the metal buildings
immediately to the south), revealing that the
disturbed fill zone extended an additional
20-40 cm beneath the current ground
surface, and had truncated the underlying
natural soil of Zone 1. The fill layer
contained significant amounts of modern
debris, including cans, bottles, carpet
fragments, decomposing shoes, animal bone
(cow), and fragments of clothing. The
preserved portion of Zone 1 ranged from 1525 cm in thickness, and consisted of a loose
sand. Zone 2 appears to be the preHolocene subsoil, and consisted of an
extremely compact mottled sandy clay that
was at least 40 cm in thickness, and
extended below the base of the trench.
revealed an upper zone of sandy loam, 50-60
cm in thickness, a 40-50 cm thick layer of
brown sand, and an underlying stratum of
sandy clay.

For the current project, MAC
conducted the systematic mechanical
excavation of a series of connected shallow
scrapings and deeper trench/probes along
the long axis of the “jurisdictional initial
survey area” (JISA; Figure 4). The deeper
trenches (BHTs 1-3) were placed near the
two ends, and near the middle of the tract,
and were excavated first in order to
document the subsurface stratigraphy, and
determine the depth to which the scraping
would need to reach in order to make any
graveshaft features visible.

MAC has successfully employed
this procedure in a number of investigations
within the past fifteen years. In three
instances,
one
conducted
for
the
Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris
County, one for the City of Houston Public
Works Department, and the last for a private
developer, MAC was able to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the clients and the Texas
Historical Commission that no graves were
present within the areas of concern. The
methodology was equally successful in the
remaining cases including, for example,
work conducted at the City of Houston’s E.
R. and Ann Taylor Park, for the Harris
County Flood Control District and for the
American General Land Development
Company at its Greatwood planned
community, though the results contrasted
with the negative outcomes cited above.
Each of these investigations resulted in the
identification of numerous, previously

BHT 2 was placed near the center of
the JISA (Figure 4). The trench measured
3.0 m in length, 2.0 m in width, and reached
a maximum depth of 1.30 m (Figures 9, 10).

approximately 3500 sq ft in exposed area,
these shallow trenches were intended to
expose any grave-shaft features that
extended into the underlying intact soils.
These scraped areas averaged 50 cm in
depth, but in some cases extended down to
100 cm due to the undulating nature of the
subsoils. The scraped area roughly bisected
the JISA, extending for almost 100 m
between BHTs 1 and 3. The irregular shape
of the scraped trench resulted from the
necessity of avoiding the large number of
trees present with in the heavily wooded
tract.

The excavation revealed a 35 cm thick upper
Zone 1 of sandy loam; Zone 2, a 20-30 cm
thick layer of brown sand; Zone 3, a 40-60
cm thick layer of sandy clay, and Zone 4, an
underlying stratum of gray clay that
extended beyond the base of the trench.
BHT 3 was placed at the north end
of the JISA (Figure 4), and measured 3.0 m
in length, 3.0 m in width, and reached a
maximum depth of 1.30 m (Figures 11, 12).
The trench revealed an upper Zone 1 of
sandy loam, 10-20 cm in thickness; Zone 2,
a 5-15 cm thick layer of clayey sand; Zone
3, a 20-35 cm thick layer of sand; Zone 4, a
20-25 cm thick layer of mottled sandy sand;
and Zone 5, an underlying stratum of gray
clay that extended beyond the base of the
trench.

Other than the modern debris in the
disturbed fill encountered by BHT 1, no
cultural materials or evidence of grave
shafts, or any related cemetery/historic
features were identified in any of the
backhoe trenches or scraped areas.

Between the three backhoe trenches
a series of mechanical scrapings where
excavated (Figures 4, 13, 14). Totaling

RECOMMENDATIONS
An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the tract was conducted, and included
both surface and subsurface (shovel test and
backhoe trench) examination. A total of
nine shovel tests were excavated across the
entire tract, and approximately 3512 sq ft of
backhoe excavation was conducted. The
mechanical excavation was limited to the
“jurisdictional initial survey area,” which
consisted of the 23,000 sq ft area
immediately adjacent to the 1st Street and
which represents the area of highest
probability for containing grave features.

On April 4-8, 2011, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted
cultural resource investigations for the
proposed Boys and Girls Club facility in
Huntsville, northern Walker County, Texas.
The investigations (MAC PN 10-34) were
conducted for The City of Huntsville under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5917.
The project area of potential effect
(APE) consists of a two acre tract that will
contain a 20,000 sq ft Boys and Girls Club
building and associated infrastructure
construction.
The tract is located
immediately east of the North Side
Cemetery, and is separated from the
cemetery grounds by 1st Street. The tract
thus falls within the Texas Historical
Commission,
Archeology
Division,
regulations in regards to ground disturbance
in proximity to recorded cemeteries, as well
as the occasional occurrence of unmarked
graves outside the currently visible
boundaries of such cemeteries. The City of
Huntsville therefore requested a proposal to
determine with a justifiably high level of
confidence whether or not human burials are
present within the tract. This project was
tailored to that objective, as well as to
assessing the presence or absence of any
other class of significant archeological
deposits within the subject property.

No prehistoric or historic cultural
materials or features, or any trace of grave
shafts or stains or other evidence suggesting
the presence of human burials was found by
the shovel tests, mechanically excavated
trench, or surface observations.
Consequently,
no
further
archeological
investigations
are
recommended. In the event that additional
archeological deposits or features should be
encountered during construction, work
should cease in the immediate vicinity and
the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.
