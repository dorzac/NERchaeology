ARCHEOLOGICAL MATERIALS FROM FIVE
ISLANDS IN THE LAGUNA MADRE,
TEXAS COAST
T. N.

CAMPBELL

In the central section of the Texas coast two cultural units
have been recognized, the Aransas Focus, which has been
assigned to the Archaic Stage, and the Rockport Focus,
which has been assigned to the Neo-American Stage (Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, pp. 121-128). The Aransas Focus
is known chiefly from two excavated sites on Aransas Bay
(Campbell, 1947, 1952); but the Rockport Focus is known
only from brief reports of archeological survey work (Martin, n. d., 1929, 1931; Potter, 1930; Sayles, 1935); from excavated Aransas Focus sites with small Rockpor.t components
(Campbell, ibid.); and from supplementary data included
in the Handbook (Suhm, et al., 1954). In the archeological
literature it is not possible to find a single description of an
isolated Ro·c kport Focus component, based either on excavation or a large surface collection. It is evident that the
Rockport Focus needs documentation.
The purpose of this paper is to report archeological materials from five islands located at the northern end of the
Laguna Madre in Nueces County, Texas. These materials
are derived both from surface collections (1929 to present)
and from excavation (1933), but for the latter materials
the methods of control used in excavation do not meet current standards. Nevertheless, the collections from these five
sites clearly indicate an Aransas as well as a Rockport occupation. The evidence documents an extension of the Aransas
Focus farther south on the Texas coast, and it also adds
much detail to our knowledge of the content of the Rockport Focus.
The five islands are located (Fig. 1) just south of Corpus
Christi Bay, which is connected with the Laguna Madre, a
narrow body of water that lies between enormously long
Padre Island and the Texas mainland. Flour Bluff marks
the entrance into the Laguna Madre. Just south of Flour

8

Texas Archeological Society

Bluff a chain of small, low-lying islands closely parallels
the mainland shore for a distance of three or four miles.
These islands are in the extreme eastern part of Nueces
County, some 10 or 12 miles southeast of downtown Corpus
Christi and just east and southeast of the Corpus Christi
Nav·a l Air Base. Most of .t he available maps show at least
seven islands in the chain, but there are also a number of
islets that do not show. On five of the seven larger islands
archeological sites have been reported. These sites, from
north to south, are designated as follows: Site 77B5-13 (Indian Island), Site ?7B5-1 (W~bb Island), Site 77B5-2, Site
77B8-6, and Site 77B8-7.
Archeological sites on this chain of islands have been
briefly and somewhat casually reported in three publications by George C. Martin and Wendell H. Potter, who
visited the islands and made surface collections during the
course of an archeological survey, 1927-1929. Only one site
is descri:bed, an unidentified island at the northern end of
the chain whose surface was littered with fractured pebhles,
flint flakes, and potsherds (Martin, 1929, p. 51). Mention is
made, without specifying any particular island, that human
skulls and various long bones had been exposed by wave
action (ibid., p. 50). Both Martin and Potter provide scattered references, along with ·a few illustrations, to specimens
collected from sites on these islands. Except for two specimens of pottery, the specific provenience of these objects is
not given. The list is brief 1b ut illuminating in a general
way. It includes a bone or shell pendant (Martin, 1929, p.
54); a cylindrical pebble with an encircling groove near one
end (ibid.); two flint drills, one with an irregularly shaped
stem (Martin and Potter, n. d., Par.t 1, plate at left, specimen No. 4), the other bipointed and with a triangular cross
section (Martin, 1929, p. 56); eight small flint arrow points:
four Perdiz points,* one Fresno point, two Starr points, and
one broadly lanceolate point with straight base (Martin and
Potter, n. d., Part 2, plate at left and plate at right, specimens

points; one Abasolo point (ibid., plate at left, No. 12), one
rechipped Lange point (ibid., No. 9), and one Pedernales
point (ibid., No. 16).
The two specimens of pottery, referred to above, were
collected on Webb Island (also called Arrowhead Island).
One is a portion of the neck of a vessel which had an internal
flange "on which a lid could rest" (Potter, 1930, p. 40). The
second specimen, a hemispherical bowl of Rockport Blackon-Gray, is of considerable importance .because it is one of
the few complete vessels of this type ever reported. Wavy
lines extend downward from the lip, which is also painted.
This bowl is stated to have been "plowed up" on Arrowhead
Island (ibid., Plate 8, Fig. 15).
Fourteen flint artifacts from these islands in the Laguna
Madre were donated to the University of Texas by George
C. Martin in 1930. The specific island from which each
specimen came is unknown. The collection includes one
Desmuke dart point, one Catlin dart point, a small flake
knife, two crudely fashioned oval bifaces, three small planoconvex end-scrapers, and five side-scrapers.
The evidence presented by Martin and Potter clearly indicates a Rockport Focus occupation of this chain of islands
at the northern end of the Laguna Madre. Particularly diagnostic are the small, plano-convex end-scrapers, Perdiz and
Fresno arrowpoints, and the bowl of Rockport Black-onGray pottery. An earlier occupation, the Aransas Focus, is
also indicated by the various dart points which can be
identified.
INDIAN ISLAND SITE
The northernmost island in the chain of islands along the
mainland shore has at times lbeen known as Indian Island
(Fig. 1). Tlhis island has an area of less than two acres, a
maximum elevation of a:bout four feet above mean sea level,
and is separated from the mainland by a narrow salt flat
which is covered ·b y water only at times of exceptionally
high tide.

Archeological Materials from the Texas Coast

This islet was visited in 1929 by A. E. Anderson of Brownsville, Texas, whose notes are on file at the University of
Texas. Anderson states that a midden some 12 to 18 inches
in thickness covered the island at the time of his visit but
that the hurricane of 1919 had done consider·a ble damage to
the deposit. He dug small pits in various places on the island
and passed the excavated material through a screen. A few
artifacts were found in this way. Most of his collection,
however, was obtained from the eroded surface areas. It
consists of 94 stone, bone, and shell ohj ects and 13 potsherds.
Anderson's catalogue makes no distinction between artifacts
excavated and artifacts collected from the surface. This
imposes no real difficulty in interpretation, because the assembl·a ge clearly indicates a Rockport Focus occupation.
Only two specimens suggest an earlier Archaic occupation.

Projectile Points. The flint projectile points, 25 in number, are nearly all arrowpoints. One large, bipointed specimen (Plate 1, F) appears to be a broad form of Lerma dart
point. An additional fragmentary, rechipped specimen,
which has been c1assHied as a knife, may actually be a
form of Desmuke point. The two specimens constitute the
only evidence of an earlier Archaic occupation at the Indian
Island site.
The remaining 24 projectile points are arrowpoints and
occur in forms that consistently appear in the Rockport
Focus as now known. The Perdiz type predominates and is
represented by 12 points (Plate 1, A-B). These Perdiz points
all have the same stem form, but the blade edges vary from
concave (two specimens) through straight (eight) to convex (two). Two additional points (Plate 1, C) are similar
to Perdiz but have narrow stems with parallel edges and
bluntly rounded bases. These may be variants of Perdiz
(their stem bases are lightly damaged), and the same may
be said of two additional points of the same form but with
somewhat broader stems. These last two specimens are
crudely made from very thin, curved flakes and bear flake
scars only here and there along the stem and blade edges.
One speeimen with ·a rudimentary stem is recognizable as

12

a Cliffton point (Plate 1, D). Three points are lozengeshaped in outline, and one of these (Plate 1, E) is unifacially
beveled at both ends, left on the distal portion, right on the
proximal portion. Two triangular points with concave bases
(Plate 1, G) are Fresno points. Plate 1, I, is probably also a
Fresno arrowpoint, but it is thicker, more crudely made, and
asymmetrically triangular. The last point in the series is
broadly lanceloate in form and has a concave base (Plate
1, H).

Knives. The Indian Island collection includes six rather
nondescript sp~cimens which are proba<bly best classified as
small knives (Plate 1, L). They are roughly chipped and in
outline vary from ovate to trianguloid. In length they range
from 43 to 58 mm. and in thickness from 7 to 14 mm. Two
are so crudely fashioned that they may never have been
used.
End-scrapers. Thirty plano-convex end-scrapers made of
flint are included in this collection (Plate 1, M-P). They
are small in size, varying in length from 15 to 46 mm., and
in outline they range from ovate to almost circular. Most of
these tools are actually combination end- and side-scrapers.
Only six are retouched at the end only (Plate 1, M) . Of the
remaining 24 specimens, eight are retouched along one lateral edge (Plate 1, N) and 16 along both lateral edges (Plate
1, 0). Three of the combination scrapers also bear a beaklike graver point on one lateral edge (Plate 1, P). The extremely small end-scraper shown in Plate 1, 0, is the only
one of its kind in the Indian Island series. This tiny form is
common in the Brownsville Focus farther south on the Gulf
coast (MacNeish, 1947, p. 6).
Side-scrapers. Twenty-four side-scrapers (Plate 1, Q-S)
were made from small flint flakes, many of which are long,
narrow, and prismatic in form. In length they range from
22 to 54 mm. Seven of these are retouched along one of the
long sides, producing a more or less straight edge (Plate 1,
Q) ; 12 specimens have two such retouched edges opposite
each other; and four, which were made from broader flakes,

have one broadly convex retouched edge (Plate 1, R). One
side-scraper is unique in that it has a short stem (Plate 1,
S). Most of these side-scrapers show only light retouching.

Drills. The flint drills from this site, five in number, are
distinctive in form. Three are complete and almost identical
in size and shape (Plate 1, J). They are narrow and thick
(thickness is almost as great as width); the proximal ends
are pointed, and two of these three specimens show wear at
the distal end. Their average length is 21 mm. This particular form of drill, which has a tapered proximal end, was
probably set in a handle. A fourth fragmentary specimen
appears to be of the same type. The fifth drill in this series
(Plate 1, K) is broader, is asymmetrical in outline, and has
a narrow, straight base.
Flint Cores. The Indian Island collection contains only
one flint core, but this specimen helps to visualize the
method of obtaining flakes for m aking scrapers and arrowpoints. An elongated river pebble was broken transversely
near one end. The fractured surface of the larger por.tion
was used as a striking platform, and flakes were struck from
the sides of the peb ble, leaving rather long flake scars that
give the core a roughly fluted appearance. This form is
sometimes called a polyhedral core.
Bone and Shell Artifacts. Objects of bone consist of an
undecorated tubular head of bird bone (Plate 1, T) with a
length of 42 mm. and a diameter of 6 mm. (the saw-cut
ends have not been smoothed) ; the distal tip of a wellground spatulate implement of split bone, probably a flaking
tool (Plate 1, U) ; and a sliver of split ·b one having a beveled,
saw-cut facet at one end.
Two small ()bjects of conch shell were collected. One is
roughly disk-shaped (diameter 14 mm.) with a smoothly
ground edge (Plate 1, X); the other is rectanguloid (14 x 16
mm.) with rough edges (Plate 1, Y). These are very common objects in the Brownsville Focus (MacNeish, 1947, p.
6), but rare in known Rockport Focus sites.

16

Texas Archeological Society

Pottery. Fourteen sherds of Rockport ware were collected
by Anderson. Two sherds appear to be from Rockport Plain
bottles. One is a rim sherd from a bottle with narrow, vertical neck and rounded lip; the other is from the neck of a
similar but larger bottle whose exterior surface was heavily
coated with asphaltum. The remaining 12 sherds seem to
come from about six different vessels whose exterior surfaces were brushed, and in eight of these sherds the interior
surface is also brushed. One sherd bears an asphaltumcoated interior, and another has a crack-lacing hole.
Conclusions. This assemblage of artifacts from Indian Island may for the most part be attr1buted to the Rockport
Focus, and this site is the nearest thing to a single-component site that has been reported. Evidence of an earlier
Archaic occupation is very slight. Two artifact forms, the
very small end-scraper and the conch-shell disk, which are
rare at this site and common in sites of the Brownsville
Focus to the south, suggest interaction bet·w een these two
contemporary cultural groups.
WEBB ISLAND SITE
Webb Island, also known as Arrowhead Island, is the
largest of the islands at the northern end of the island chain
(Fig 1). It is separated from the mainland by a channel of
very shallow water some 500 feet in width. Webb Island is
irregular in shape, the main part to the north being roughly
circular, with a smaller lobate extension to the south and
southwest. A small but relatively long inlet almost divides
the northern part of the island from its southern extension.
From north to south Webb Island has a length of approximately 1,250 feet, and its maximum width from east to west
is about 850 feet. The average elevation above mean sea
l'evel is between two and three feet. Grasses and scattered
weeds make up the vegetative cover. The eastern shore is
heavily eroded, and it is clear that wave action, particularly
during hurricanes, has caused steady retreat of this shore
line for a long time.
The island has been visited by a number of individuals

Archeological Materials from the Texas Coast

17

who have made their collections available for study, and it
has also been tested by excavation. Approximately 5,439
specimens have been collected at the Webb Island site. Of
these, 465 are artifacts of stone, bone, and shell, and 4,974
are potsherds. A chronological account uf the various investigations is presented below.
On January 6, 1929, A. E. Anderson of Bro-wnsville visited Webb Island, collected a few artifacts, and recorded
observations on some ten burials that had recently been
exposed by wave action on the eastern shore. One wellpreserved skull was collected.
In July, 1929, a small surface collection from Webb Island
was donated to the University of Texas by J. C. Webb, landowner. Presumably these specimens were collected over a
period of years preceding that date.
A. M. Wilson o·f the University of Texas visited Webb
Island in the summer of 1930, accompanied by George C.
Martin of Rockport, who directed him to the site. Wilson
collected artifacts, chiefly potsherds, from the eroded beach
and shallow water on the eastern shore of the island. According to Wilson's notes, the Laguna Madre was at that
time rapidly encroaching on the land and removing the
midden deposit capping the island.

Alexander Cox, a resident of Corpus Christi, made collections from the surface at Webb Island at various times
prior to 1933. Part of his collection from the island was
donated to the University of Texas in July, 1933.
Test excavations (described below) at Webb Island were
made by A. 'T. Jackson and a crew of several men during a
three-day period (July 16-18) in the summer of 1933. Most
of the artifacts described below were derived from this investigation by the University of Texas.
At various times during the past 15 years William E.
St·a nton of Corpus Christi has collected from the -surface at
Webb Island. His collection was recently made available for

18

Texas Archeological Society

study, and all of his potsherds from Webb Island were donated to the University of Texas.
In his excavations of 1933, Jackson dug four test trenches
on the eastern shore of Webb Island. Three of these were
dug at intervals of about 75 feet on the larger northern part
of the island, and the fourth was dug across the narrow
isthmus which joins the two main parts of the island. The
width of these test tren~hes is unspecified, but a sketch map
in the field notes indicates that they had approximate
lengths of 100, 150, 90, and 60 feet. The three trenches on
the northern part of the island began at the eastern beach
line and proceeded in a westerly direction toward the interior of the island.
The field records do not refer to any method of excavation
control, and depth records do not seem to have been made
for any artifacts. However, the statement is made that all
of the artifacts encountered during excavation were in the
upper 15 inches of midden deposit. It is also stated that
nearly all of the pottery and flint artifacts occurred in the
topmost eight inches of the midden, but a few potsherds
were found as deep as 14 inches below the surface. AI though
two cultural horizons are present at Webb Island, it is not
possible to separate them on the basis of clear stratigraphic
evidence. Except for pottery, nothing can be attributed to
any particular level in the midden. The artifacts derived
from this excavation must perforce be assigned the same
status as those taken from the surface by the various collectors.
The midden deposit seems to have covered most of the
northern part of the island, and in Jackson's excavations it
ranged in thickness from 18 inches to 33 inches. It was made
up principally of discarded marine shells and animal bones
in a loose matrix of dark, sandy soil. Field ident1fications
indicate that the shells included oyster, clam, and conch,
and that bones included fish, bird, and deer, as wen as a
few bison and human bones. Most of the animal bones were
fragmented and showed traces of having been in fire. Beds
of charcoal were noted at several places in the excavations,

and one such area was identified as a "fire pit". Bits of
burned clay, fragments of pumice, and lumps of asphaltum
occurred here and there in the midden deposit. The artifacts scattered through the upper part of the midden-it is
puzzling that no artifacts were ,f ound in the lower partconsisted of objects made from stone, bone, shell, and clay
(pottery). Also ine'luded were flint chips and cores, which
indicate local flint chipping. No European objects were encountered during excavation, but coins and pieces of rusted
iron were collected from the surface.
When Anderson visited Webb Island in 1929, some ten
burials were in various stages of exposure by wave action
in one section of the eastern beach. Groups of human bones
were distributed over a beach zone some 150 feet wide. This
zone extended from a low, wave-cut bluff out into shallow
water. Some burials were exposed in situ; others were entirely uncovered and the bones were being scattered by the
waves. One skuiJ.l was observed in situ under six inches of
water. Anderson's notes provide no data on position and
orientation of the skeletons. Among the bones of one burial
a deer metapodial awl was found (Plate 4, C); and from the
burial area one conch shell adze was also collected. These
occurrences suggest that some of the burials belong to the
Aransas occupation. Anderson estimates that the skeletons
were probably buried at a depth of some three feet at a time
when the island was at least 200 feet wider that it was in
1929.
In the following sections the artifacts from Webb Island
will be described by classes, as dart points, knives, drills,
etc. For each class described, certain types and forms will
be identified as probably associated with either the Aransas
or the Rockport Focus. The b'asis for such judgments is the
reported presence of these types and forms in other components of these foci on the Gu'lf coast.

Dart Points. Fifty-two dart points occur in the Webb
Island series, of which nine are unclassifiable fragments.
Twelve types have been recognized among the remaining

22

Texas Archeological Society

43 specimens, and these types are listed below in order of
frequency.
(1) Catan (Plate 2, E-F), nine specimens (21 % ) . Four
of these are unifacially beveled on the left.
(2) Matamoros (Plate 2, J), eight specimens (19 %). One
is unHacially beveiled on the left.
(3) Tortugas (Plate 2, H-I), seven specimens (16 %). Two
are unifacially ·b eveled on the left.
(4) Kent (Plate 2, L), four specimens (9 % ).
(5) Abasolo (Plate 2, B-D), three specimens (7 % ). The
point at Plate 2 (Plate 2, B) has been damaged at the base,
which is the reason for its fluted appearance.
(6) Darl (Plate 2, R), two specimens (5 %). One of these
has a unifacial'ly beveled stem (left) and a unifacially beveled blade (right); the other has only a unifacially beveled
stem (right).
(7) Refugio (Plate 2, A), two specimens (5 % ).
(8) Ensor (Plate 2, Q), one specimen (2 % ).
(9) Castroville (Plate 2, 0), one specimen (2 %).
(10) Desmuke (Plate 2, K), one specimen (2%).

(11) Morhiss (Plate 2, M), one specimen (2%).
(12) Palmillas (Plate 2, N), one specimen (2 % ).
(13) Unidentified (Plate 2, G, P), three specimens (7 % ) .
The specimen not illustrated (a basal fragment) is similar
to Plate 2, P, but has a straight base.
In order to facilitate comparison, the dart points from two
excavated and previously .published Archaic sites (Aransas
Focus) on the Texas coast have been re-examined and the
types identified with the assistance of Dee Ann Suhm. These
are the Johnson site (Campbell, 1947) and the Kent-Crane
site (Campbell, 1952), both of which are located about 40
airline miles north of Webb Island.

Archeological Materials from the Texas Coast

23

Among the nine dart points from the Johnson site seven
types can be identified: Catan, 2; Matamoros, 1; Ensor, 1;
Edgewood, 1; Ellis, 1; Kent, 1; Lange, 1; unidentified, 1.
At the Kent-Crane site, with 101 dart points, 20 types can
be identified: Kent, 19; Ensor, 14; Tortugas, 12; Lange, 10;
Marcos, 6; Matamoros, 5; Travis, 5; PalmiLlas, 5; Ellis, 4;
Abasolo, 3; Catan, 1; Pedernales, 1; Uvalde, 1; Martindale, 1;
Edgewood, 1; Desmuke, 1; Bulverde, 1; Kinney, 1; Nolan, 1;
Marshall, 1; unidentified, 8. As the total number is 101, the
above frequences serve as approximate percentages.
To those unaccustomed to a muHiplicity of projectile point
types in the same component, the recognition of 20 different
types at the Kent-Crane site may seem unbelievably large.
It may be pointed out, however, that the Archaic cultures of
central and southern Texas are marked by an amazingly
large number of dart point types (Suhm et al., 1954, p. 100) .
An adequate explanation for this phenomenon has not yet
been found .
When the dart points from Webb Island are compared
with those from the Kent~Crane site, a number of signi.f icant
facts emerge. Most o,f the types that occur at Webb Island
also occur at Kent-Crane. The exceptions are low-frequency
types (Morhiss, Refugio, Castroville, and Darl do not occur
at Kent-Crane). Fewer types characteristic of the Edwards
Plateau Aspect occur at Weblb Island. Types characteristic
of the Fa'lc6n and Mier foci of southern Texas and adjoining
northeastern Mexico occur in both sites (Tortugas, Abasolo,
Matamoros, and Catan), but the frequency of each type is
considembly higher at Webb Island. This suggests that as
one moves southward from the central section of the Texas
coast, Falcon and Mier dart point types will increase in frequency and Edwards Plateau types will decline.
Of the 12 dart point types represented at Webb Island,
all except Catan, Matamoros, Darl, and Ensor may safely be
attributed to an Aransas occupation. The status of the four
exceptions is uncertain because they are types which appear
to have survived from the the Archaic into the N eo-Ameri-

can stage in central and southern Tex·a s (Suhm, et al., 1954,
pp. 410, 414, 422, 448).
Arrowpoints. All of the 'a rrow.points at Webb Island are
attrilbuted to the Rockport Focus. The series consists of
242 flint arrowpoints, of which 13 are unclassifiable fragments. Of the 229 classifiable points, 206 have been identified as follows:

(1) Perdiz (Plate 3, A-P), 148 specimens (65%). As this
is a fairly large sample from a single site, it provides an
opportunity to study local variation in the Perdiz type. Of 82
points wHh stems undamaged, about 36% have stems that
are bluntly rounded as opposed to sharply pointed. In a
number of these points (13 % ) the stem has approximately
parallel edges for a large part of its 'length before tapering
to a point (Plate 3, C, H, I). About 10% of this group have
short, broad stems in com:b inati:on with square or sloping
shoulders (Plate 3, N-P), and some of these, although smaller
in size, grade into the Cliffton type (cf. Plate 3, Q-S). Suhm
(personal communication) points out that a few of these
(Plate 3, J, P) resemble the Bassett type of northeastern
Texas (Fulton Aspect). Approximately 30% of these Perdiz
points have long, narrow stems (Plate 3, A, E, L, M), and
about 47% have stems that are relatively short and narrow
(Plate 3, B, G, J). In the whole series of Perdiz points (148
specimens) blade edges tend to be perfectly straight (37%)
or concave (37%); less commonly convex (26%). In specimens with convex blade edges the amount of convexity is
not great. A majority of the Perdiz points are barbed (77%);
some have square shoulders (17%); and a few have poorly
defined shoulders (6 % ). Serrated blade edges occur in
about 6% of the Perdiz points at this site.
(2) Fresno (Plate 3, HH-JJ), 29 specimens (13%). Of
the 29, 11 have bases that are s·t raight or almost straight and
18 have concave bases; five have serrated lateral edges. One
additional arrowpoint, possibly of Fresno type, was rechipped at the distal end to form a short-pointed drill (Plate
3, RR).

(3) Starr (Plate 3, EE-GG), 16 specimens (7%). All of
these Starr points have concave bases and concave lateral
edges, but in some specimens the basal concavity is rather
shallow. The dividing line between Starr and Fresno points
in the Webb Island series has to 'be drawn al'lbitrarily, for
the two types grade into each other. Starr points are common in the Brownsville and Mier Foci of extreme southern
Texas and northeastern Mexico (Suhm, et al., 1954, pp. 132,
141), and their presence at Webb Island in a Rockport component is of special interest.
(4) Cliffton (Plate 3, Q-S), 6 specimens (3 % ) . As Cliffton
points elsewhere are consistently associated with Perdiz
points, it is possible that Cliffton is only an extreme variant
of Perdiz.

(5) Young (Plate 3, LL), 5 specimens (2 %). These have
been chipped from thin flakes, and in each specimen only
one face is covered ·b y flake scars, the other face being marginally retouched. Four of these points have convex bases;
the fifth has a base that is almost straight. Young points
are associated with the Henrietta Focus of north-central
Texas and adjoining part of southern Oklahoma, and they
are said to be rare in central Texas (Suhm et al., 1954, p.
510). Their presence at Webb Island extends the distribution of the Young point to the Gulf coast.
(6) Scallorn (Plate 3, X-Y), 2 specimens (1 %) .
Arrowpoints of unidentified type at Webb Island number
23 (about 10%) . The principal forms are described below.
Eleven arrowpoints have slightly expanding stems with
convex bases, concave to straight blade edges, and strong
ba11bs (Plate 3, Z-DD). Two of these are very small (Plate
3, DD). These points do not appear to be variants of the
Scallorn type, which is represented by only two readily
identifiaJble specimens at this site. They show considerable
variation, especially in size and in stem width.
Seven arrowpoints are neatly lozenge-shaped in outline
(Plate 3, T, U), and it is difficult in some instances to de-

28

Texas Archeological Society

termine which is the proximal end. These are made from
thin flakes and are marginally retouched on both faces. It
is possible that they are extreme variants of Perdiz (cf.
Pl·a te 3, N, with T, U).
Two arrowpoints are lanceolate in outline; one has a concave base (Plate 3, V), the other has a convex base (Plate
3, W).
Two arrowpoints are trianguloid but have strongly convex bases (Plate 3, MM). They resemble Young points in
outline and method of manufacture, but they are much
smaller in size (the smallest is only 16 mm. long). These
may be variants of the Fresno type.
One point, unique in the Webb Island series, is lanceolate
in outline and has recurved lateral edges (Plate 3, KK). It
bears some resemblance to the Talco type of northeastern
Texas (Titus Focus), but it does not appear to fall within
the Talco range of variation (see Suhm et al., 1954, p. 508).
The arrowpoint (as opposed .to the dart point) has consistently :been recognized as diagnostic of the Rockport Focus, but very few .arrowpoints from the central section of
the 'T exas coast have been described and illustrated in the
literature. The arrowpoints from Indian Island and Webb
Island, although not stratigraphically isolated by excavation,
are important because they provide a measure of typological
range in the Rockport Focus. The types present at these
two sites will, of course, have to be validated by controlled
excavation.

Knives. Only two flint knives occur in the Webb Island
collections. They are large, relatively thin, and almost circular in outline (Plate 4, G). The Abasolo and Refugio dart
points described above (see Plate 2, A-D) may also have
served as knives. At present it is not poss1ble to assign
these knives to a particular component at Wehb Island.
End-scrapers. One of the most common and characteristic
tools at Webb Island is a very small plano-convex endscraper made of flint (Plate 2, U-Z). Fifty-nine of these

Archeological Materials from the Texas Coast

29

were collected and nearly all of them are less than 40 mm.
in length. Some are actually of thumb-nail size. These endscrapers are all very much alike, being fashioned from fairly
thick flakes and having a steeply retouched convex scraping
edge at one end. Occasionally one or both lateral edges are
also retouched to form a combination side- and end-scraper.
There are minor variations, however, and some of these
may be noted. The extremely small end-scrapers, six in
number, have a breadth equal to or somewhat greater than
the length (Plate 2, U). Two end-scrapers are very long
and narrow, and one of these has both lateral edges retouched. Thirty are ovoid in outline (Plate 2, V), though
the steeply retouched end may sometimes broaden out to
give the specimen an outline that is more pyriform than
ovoid (Plate 2, Y). A few of these ovoid scrapers bear a retouched lateral concavity (Plate 2, W). Nineteen may be referred to as truncated ovoid (Plate 2, X) . Two specimens
have a broadly elliptical outline; these are made from thicker flakes and the whole circumference is steeply retouched
(Plate 2, Z).
The similarity of the end-scrapers at Webb Island to those
at Indian Island would indicate that most of the end-scrapers
at Webb Island are referable to the Rocroport Focus. Reference has already been made to the common occurrence of
the extremely small end-scrapers in the Brownsville Focus.
Side-scrapers. The 29 flint side-scrapers (Plate 2, AACC) are also rather small. Twenty-two of these are prismatic flakes with one or both lateral edges neatly retouched.
The retouched edges are usually quite straight, but occasionally they may be slightly concave or slightly convex (Plate
2, AA-BB). The average length of these prismatic forms is
20 mm. Two side-scrapers are conchoidal in outline and
have one strongly convex scraping edge (Plate 2, CC). The
remaining five specimens are concave scrapers made from
larger and thicker flakes. It is likely that most of the sidescrapers belong to the Rockport occupation at Webb Island.
In general they duplicate the series at Indian Island.

30

Texas Archeological Society

Gravers. Four rather thick flint flakes bear graver points
(Plate 2, S), short 'b eak-like projections showing minute retouching on both edges near the point. None of these has
flake scars on the buLbar or flat face of the flake. Flint
gravers are known to occur in the Aransas Focus (Campibell,
1952, p. 71), and for this reason the Webb Island gravers are
attri:buted to the Aransas component. It may turn out that
gravers also occur in the Rockport Focus.
Drills. Flint drills number 12 specimens and most of these
are slender bipointed forms. Four are rod-like in form, with
edges parallel for most of the length, and they are carefully
chipped on both faces to produce a thickly lenticular crosssection (Plate 3, NN-00). Six are similar, but the proximal
end tapers below what may be called poorly defined shoulders, giving the effect of a pointed stem (Plate 3, PP), like
those at Indian Island. These could have served as arrowpoints, for they grade into the Perdiz arrowpoint series.
Slender, 'b ipointed drills also occur in the Brownsville F·o cus
(MacNeish, 1947, p. 6). Another form of drill, represented
by oniy one specimen (Plate 3, QQ) was made by shaping
one end of a long, narrow flake to a tapered point; the
opposite or proximal end is bulbous and shows only a small
amount of retouching. One triangular arrowpoint, possilbly
of Fresno type, had been rechipped to form a short-pointed
drill (Plate 3, RR). All of these drills are attributed to the
Rockport Focus.
Gouge. One very small plano-convex gouge (or endscraper) of flint was collected at Webb Island (Plate 2, T).
This specimen is 33 mm. long and 24 mm. wide, and the
steeply retouched cutting edge is battered and dulled from
use. Except for its very small size, this tool is indistinguishable from the larger Clear Fork gouge that occurs widely in
Archaic cultures of the Texas area. Sayles (1935, Table 5)
attrilbutes the small form to his Rockpol't Phase on the Texas
coast. The survival of this form later than the Archaic stage
on the coast needs to be confirmed by excavation.
Miscellaneous Flint Artifacts. Two small flakes, each bearing a neatly serrated edge, were also collected at Webb

Island (Plate 2, DD), as well as a large number of flint
flakes of assorted sizes that may have 1been used but bear
no traces of retouching or use. These materials cannot be
assigned to any particular occupation at the site.

Milling Stones. Milling stones seem to have been rare at
Webb Island. The collections include one hand stone (mano)
and one fragment of a grinding slab, both made of sandstone.
The hand stone has 'been shaped by pecking; it is broadly
oval in outline and has one strongly convex grinding facet
(Plate 4, E). The grinding-slab fragment shows wear on
both flat surfaces. Milling stones have not yet been linked
with the Rockport Focus, but they do occur in the Aransas
Focus (Campbell, 1947, pp. 59-60).
Hammerstones. A lenticular core of mottled gray flint
(69 x 81 x 28 mm.) was used as a hammerstone, for its circumference is heavily battered in places. A rectanguloid
quartzite pebble also shows battering along all its edges.
These could have occurred in either occupation at Webb
Island.
Abrading Stones. Five small, thin fragments of sandstone
show flat or slightly concave grinding facets on both surfaces. Fragments 9f pumice, which frequently wash ashore
on the Texas coast, appear to have been collected by the
aboriginal inhabitants and used for purposes of abrasion.
Six such pumice fragments, all roughly oval in outline, were
found on Weblb Island, three of them in Jackson's excavations. The largest has a length of 97 mm., but only one of
these six fragments exhibits any evidence of usage-a flat
facet developed by abrasion. Sandstone abraders have been
reported from Aransas sites (Campbell, 1952, p. 72), but
sandstone and pumice abraders have yet to be linked with
the Rockport Focus.
Asphaltum. Lumps of asphaltum were encountered by
Jackson in the upper 12 inches of the midden deposit. Eight
were collected and brought to the laboratory. One small
piece bears a faint basketry impression on one flat surface.
Wilson also collected one small piece of asp hal tum showing

34

Texas Archeological Society

what appears to be a twined basketry impression. Thus far
asphaltum showing twined basketry impressions has been
reported only in Aransas Focus sites (Campbell, 1952, pp.
73-74). Asphal<tum was, however, extensively used for decorating and surface-coating Rockport pottery.

Shell Artifacts. Artifacts of shell are rare in the Webb
Island collections. The shells used were chiefly conch and
clam. The series includes 16 beach-rolled columellae of small
conch shells varying in length from 35 to 72 mm. Six of
these were found in the test trenches, and it is likely that
the occupants of Webb Island collected these small objects
for use as awls and even possibly as skewers for meat.
Eighteen shell objects exhibit unmistakable evidences of
human handiwork. These include seven adzes made from
conch whorl (one was found by Anderson in the burial
area), both triangular and quadrangular forms being represented in approximately equal numbers (Plate 4, A-B) ; a
conch columella gouge (Plate 4, D) ; a small end-scraper
made of clam shell (Plate 4, H); four small triangular objects ·o f thin clam shell, all approximately of the same size,
which may be awls or possibly projectile points (Plate 4,
I; this specimen differs from the others in having a beveled
base); a disk-shaped bead of conch shell (diameter 10 mm.,
thickness 5.5 mm.), with a conical perforation; a rather
large triangular piece of conch shell (Plate 4, F) ; and two
small quadrangular pieces of conch whorl. Of these various
shell objects, only one, the clam-shell end-scraper came from
the test excavation. A tiny gastropod shell (Cerithium variabile) :bears a small perforation at its anterior end, apparently by punching through the thin shell with a sharppointed tool.
Only three of these shell artifact forms can be assigned
to a specific component. Conch-shell adzes and gouges are
common in Aransas Focus sites (Campbell, 1947, p. 65), but
it has not yet been established that these forms survived
into Rockport times. Disk beads of shell occur in the
Brownsville Focus (MacNeish, 1947, p. 6), and for this
reason the single specimen from Webb Island is attributed

Archeological Materials from the Texas Coast

35

to the Rockport Focus, which is considered to be contemporaneous.

Bone Artifacts. A deer metapodial awl (Plate 4, C) was
found by Anderson in the burial area on the eastern beach.
This was among the scattered bones of one of the burials
that was being exposed by wave action. Only one other
bone artifact appears in the Webb Island collections, a fragment of a tubular bone bead. One end of this bead is ground
to a smoothly rounded edge, but the opposite end is jaggedly broken. The bead was made from a light bone having
a diameter of appro:x2imately 6 mm. The length of the fragment is 29 mm. An eroded antler tip and two garfish scales
were also collected. The latter may have served as projectile points, but this is doubtful. In the literature metapodi!al awls and bone beads have thus far been linked with
the Aransas Focus (Campbell, 1952, pp. 55, 60), but the
presence of a bone bead at Indian Island suggests that this
artifact form also occurs in the Rockport Focus.
Pottery. Some 4,974 potsherds were collected at Webb
Island. Many of these are very small fragments (exceptioll!ally small fragments were not counted), and a ronsiderable number are badly eroded by wave action, making
observations of surface treatment impossible. The identifications given below are reasonably accurate, for they are
based only on sherds with observable criteria. The category
labeled ''Rockport ware" is a residue category that includes
all sherds believed to fall within the range of the Rockport
series of types.
The types designated Rockport Plain, Rockport Black-onGray, and Rockport Incised have been described in the
Handbook (Suhm, et al., 1954, pp. 382-385). As no large
sample of Roc~ort Focus pottery from a single site has
previously been described, the following paragraphs will
summarize the characteristics of each type as shown by the
pottery from Webb Island. Only criteria of form and decoration will be considered, because paste criteria are adequately covered by the Handbook.

36

Texas Archeological Society

(1) Rockport Plain. Sixty-four rim sherds from what appear to be bowls and jars have been classified as Rockport
Plain.
The bowls, represented by 26 rim sherds, all seem to be
hemispherical in form. Nineteen of these have flat lips
(Plate 5, DD-EE), including three that have a slight external overhang (GG) and three that have diagonally incised lips, giving the flat lip a milled effect. Seven sherds
have rounded lips (Plate 5, FF). Some ibowls at Webb Island
had scored surfaces: one rim sherd has a horizontally scored
interior; two are similarly scored on both interior and exterior surfaces; and one is horizontally scored on the interior,
but scored on the exterior in a crisscross fashion. One bowl
sherd bears a crack-lacing hole.
Jars, which are represented by 38 rim sherds, appear to
have had two basic forms, one with an incurved rim (16
sherds), the other with an essentially vertical rim (22
sherds). Jars with inqurved rims have flat lips (Plate 5,
Y-AA); in this group three rim sherds show a slight internal
lip overhang (Plate 5, Z) and three show an external overhang (Plate 5, AA). Jars with vertical rims have either fiat
lips (6 cases; Plate 5, BB) or rounded lips (16 cases; Plate
5, CC). Surface scoring and exterior asphaltum-coating occur on jars. Only two sherds have a horizontally scored
interior (on one of these the exterior is asphaltum-coated).
Seven sherds have both interior and exterior surfaces scored,
all horizontally except f.or the interiors of three sherds,
which have a combination of horizontal and diagonal scoring 't hat gives the effect of a pattern. Six jar sherds have
asphaltum-coated exteriors; and one sherd is asphalt-coated
on both surfaces.
(2) Rockport Black-on-Gray. Sherds assigned to this type
total 132, of which 20 are rim sherds.
Among the 20 rim sherds, six appear to be from jars with
fairly straight rims, two with flat lips (Plate 5, T) and four
with rounded lips (P:l ate 5, U-V). Three of the six jar-rim
sherds have painted lips and the remainder have faint traces

of a single vertical wavy line on the exterior. One rim sherd
with painted lip has a horizontally scored interior.
The remaining 14 rim sherds appear to be from hemispherical bowls: eight with flat lips (Plate 5, B, C, W), one
flat lip with interior overhang (Plate 5, F), and five with
rounded lips (Plate 5, D, X). Two of the flat-lipped bowl
sherds have rather deeply notched lips (Plate 5, B). In each
case the flat lip has been painted with asphaltum, but the
painting does not extend into the notches. Lip painting also
occurs on nine additional bowl rim sherds (Plate 5, C-D).
Three sherds have a more complicated exterior design in
black paint: one horizontal band at the rim, extending over
the lip, and a fairly broad diagonal line or band located below but not connected (Plate 5, F). Asphaltum coating occurs on a few of the bowl rim sherds. Two sherds have
coated interiors, and two additional sherds have exterior
coating below, and separated from, the painted lip (Plate
5, D).
The Rockport Black-on-Gray body sherds cannot be identified as to form, although one specimen appears to be from
a narrow-necked bottle. These 112 sherds all bear traces of
a design in black on the exterior, the most common element
(82 cases) being a vertical line that varies from straight to
wavy (Plate 5, G-K). About half of these vertical lines are
straight or very slightly sinuous, the remainder being very
sinuous. One sherd shows a sinuous line extending from a
horizontal band (Plate 5, L). It is evident that a very common form of decoration on Rockport Black-on-Gray vessels
was a series of widely spaced vertical lines that extended
downward from the vessel rim, as shown by Potter (1930,
Plate 8). Diagonal lines occur only on three sherds (Plate
5, N). Dots, either in vertical rows (Plate 5, P) or scattered,
are also rather rare, occurring on only eight sherds (cf. Potter, 1930, Plate 8, Fig. 16). An additional 18 sherds bear parts
of what appear to be bolder designs (Plate 5, M, 0). Only
12 of the 112 Rockport Black-on-Gray body sherds have
scored surfaces (seven with scored interior, one with scored
exterior, and four with both surfaces scored). Only one

40

Texas Archeological Society

sherd shows exterior scoring in combinaUon with painted
decoration (Plate 5, N). An interior coating of asphaltum,
however, is very common (74 sherds). Occasionally a sherd
in this series will have faint traces of red pigment adhering
to the exterior surface, but it is very fugitive and very difficult to determine whether it is from a red wash or slip.
(3) Rockport Incised. Only one sherd of this type can be
identified in the Webb Island series (undecorated body
sherds of this type cannot be distinguished from similar
sherds of other Rockport pottery types). This single sherd
(Plate 5, A) appears to be rrom a jar with vertical rim and
rounded Jip. A cross-hatched band appears just below the
lip; one set of lines is horizontal, the other diagonal.
(4) Rockport ware body sherds. A total of 4,775 body
sherds appear to belong to the Rockport series of pottery
ty,p es but cannot be identified as Rockport Plain, Rockport
Black-on-Gray, or Rockport Incised. Of these, 3,750 are plain,
having no surface scoring or asphaltum coating; but one
sherd in this series does have a vertical row of very small
punctates ('Plate 5, E). Another sherd in this group consists of a handle fragment, round in cross-section, that is
heavily tempered with bone. In form of handle and tempering this resembles handles on Rockport pottery from the
historic Aranama Mission site in Goliad County as well as
handles on Leon Plain from the Central Texas Aspect
(Suhm et al., 1954, Plate 74, C-D). Three ibase sherds in
this plain group indicate vessels with somewhat conically
rounded bases. An additional 592 sherds are plain but are
asphaltum-coated on one or both surfaces. Scoring of one
or both surfaces, without asphaltum-coating, occurs on another group of 288 sherds, and still another group of 145
sherds exhibit a combination of scoring and asphaltum-coating. On scored sherds the scoring of the interior surface
(Plate 5, Q-S) is usually much deeper than on the exterior.
Larger twigs were used to score interior surfaces, and the
interior scored lines tend to be horizontally parallel, whereas
on the exterior they are irregularly spaced and the lines frequently cross each other. Crack-lacing holes occur in six

Archeological Materials from the Texas Coast

41

sherds of this Rockport ware body sherd series, and one
sherd has been made into a disk (diameter 20 mm., thickness 4mm.)
(5) Intrusive sherds. Very few sherds at Webb Island can
be regarded as intrusive. One sherd of light brown pottery
is heavily tempered with large white particles (material unidentified), some of which have fallen away from the surface, leaving it heavily pitted. This may be from a vessel
of Leon Plain (cf. Suhm et al., 1954, Plate 74, F) , which is
associated with the Central Texas Aspect.
A second intrusive sherd is somewhat startling. It is a
very small sherd that has been identified as Carretas Polychrome from Chihuahua, Mexico (Stanley Stubbs, letter,
Dec. 6, 1950). Carretas Polychrome is dated as circa A. D.
1300-1400. This is the only Southwestern sherd that has
been reported from the Texas coast. The date falls well
within the estimated time range of the Rockport Focus
(circa A. D. 1000-1800).

European Objects. These include a portion of a large
metal knife blade, three unidentifiable pieces of rusted
metal, and three coins. All of these came from the surface
of the site.
The coins were found among the archeological materials
exposed by w ave action on the eastern shore of Webb Island.
The first of these, and the best preserved, was found by
Alexander Cox during one of his visits to the island sometime prior to 1933; the second was found by Henry Fulton
of Corpus Christi on July 2, 1933, witnessed by J. E . Pearce
and A. T. Jackson; and the third, a poorly preserved specimen, was found by A. T. Jackson two weeks la,ter, when the
site was being excavaJted by the University of Texas. These
three coins are very much alike; they have approximately
the same size, are irregularly round in outline, and bear an
equal-armed cross in relief on one face. A photograph of the
coins found by Cox and Jackson was sent to the United
States National Museum in February, 1934, and w as examined by Theodore T. Belote, Curator of History. Belote re-

42

Texas Archeological Society

ported ,t hat the coin found by Cox-the better preserved of
the two-was a Spanish coin of uncertain date but probably
struck about 1700.
It is of course impossible to prove that these coins were
ever in the hands of the aboriginal occupants of Webb Island. There is acceptable evidence of European contact in a
number of collections from Rockport Focus sites, such as
Perdiz and Fresno arrowpoints chipped from bottle glass. It
is also of interest to note that Jackson cites (in his Webb
Island field report) unconfirmed reports of coins perforated
for suspension having been found at sites in this section of
the Texas coast. Shipwrecks on Padre Island, or any of the
other offshore barrier islands, would have been a convenient
source for these coins.

Conclusions. An analysis of the archeological materials
from Webb Island indicates that Aransas and Rockiport components are both present at this site. Unfortunately the brief
excavations at Webb Island failed to produce clear evidence
of their stratigraphic relationship. This can be inferred,
however, from evidence obtained at better documented si.tes
in this section of the coast. Both cultural groups seem to
have occupied the island because of its food p01tential-fish,
shellfish, and aquatic birds. The presence of large mammal
bones, such as deer and bison, indicate that hunting was
done on the nearby mainland.
The identification of Aransas Focus materials from Webb
Island was done on the basis of comparison with artifacts
from excavated Aransas components farther north on the
coast. The recognition of an Aransas component at Webb
Island extends the documented range of this culture some
40 to 50 miles farther southward along the coast. As dart
points characteristic of the Falcon and Mier Focus show a
higher frequency at Webb Island than at Aransas sites to
the north, it seems likely that the coastal strip south of
Corpus Christi represents a zone of transition from one
focus of Archaic culture to another.
The identification of Rockport Focus materials from Webb

Island was based on comparison with artifacts from a few
excavated Rockport components and with the surface collection from nearby Indian Island, a site which appears to
yield only Rockport artifacts. Cross-checking with published trait lists for the Rockport focus was also a part of
the procedure. The chief value of the Rockport materials
from Webb Island is that they constitute a relatively large
sample of Rockport artifacts and thus give a much clearer
impression of the content of this culture. Traits shared with
the Central Texas Aspect and with the Brownsville Focus
can be made more specific, and there is a tantalizing hint
of wider contacts in the intrusive polychrome sherd from
Chihuahua.
SITES 77B5-2, 77B8-6, AND 77B8-7
On three islands south of Webb Island (Fig 1) middens
are known to exist, but very little descriptive dart;a are available. As these islands are in the same chain as Indian Island
and Webb Island, it may be surmised that they have similar
topographic and archeological features. The three islands
were visited in 1929 by A. E. Anderson and in 1930 by A. M.
Wilson. Both men collected archeological specimens from
each island, but in their records they failed to indicate which
specimens came from which island. The two collections,
which will here be described as a unit, indicate that an
Aransas Focus occupation was followed by a Rockport Focus
occupation.
Among the artifacts attributable to the Aransas occupation is a knife or scraper (Plate 1, DD) made by chipping
the margin of a valve of the sunset clam (MacrocalLista nimbosa), an artifact type which occurred in the Aransas component at the Kent-Crane site (Campbell, 19'52, p. 54). Also
attributed to the Aransas focus are four dart poinrts (Plate 1,
Z-CC), three of which (Z-BB) can be duplicated at the
Kent-Crane site. None of these dart points is readily identifiable as to type although one (Z) may fall within the range
of the Lange point. The point AA bears a thick, white
patina. The point CC looks like a rechipped Plainview point,
but it lacks grinding on the lateral edges and base.

Rockport Focus artifacts include one small, bipointed drill
(Plate 1, V), similar to those found at Webb Island; a triangular arrowpoint with deeply serrated ~ateral edges (Plate
1, W), apparently a rare form in Rockport sites; and 263
potsherds. The sherds are mostly small and are badly eroded
by wave action, but they all appear to be from vessels of
Rockport ware. Of the 263 sherds, 238 bear no traces of
brush- marking or decorative painting with asphaHum
(many sherds are so water-worn that both exterior and
interior surfaces have 'b een removed completely). Five
sherds do show brushed or scored surfaces, and 20 sherds
have surfaces heavily coated with asphaitum.
SUMMARY AND GENERAL CONCLUSIONS
Archeological materials collected from five sites on a
chain of small islands in the Laguna Madre of the Texas
coast have been analyzed, described, and evaluated. Most
of the artifacts were collected from the surface, but on two
islands some of the artifacts were derived from limited excavation without adequate control. The assemblage from
each site (or group of sites) has been treated as a surface
collection, and an attempt has been made to reconstruct the
components represented. This "salvage" operation has limited value, but it is justifiable in a poorly known area that
is not likely to be the scene of extensive excavation within
the immediate future.
Of the four cultural stages stages now recognized in Texas,
Paleo-American, Archaic, N eo-American, and Historic, only
the first is not represented by recognizable specimens in the
collections from these islands. The Archaic Stage is well
represented by a considerable number of artifacts assignable
to the Aransas Focus, and the N eo-American Stage is even
better represented by a large number of artifacts assignable
to the Rockport Focus. Very little can be attributed to the
Historic Stage.
The Aransas components identified on these islands are
located on the extreme southern limit of the Aransas Focus
as now known. In dart-point styles the Aransas components,

particularly that at Webb Island, show more orientation toward the Falcon and Mier Foci to the south than toward the
Edwards Plateau Aspect to the north and northwest. The
reverse is true of Aransas components located farther north
on the coast.
The Rockport components on the islands add much detail
to the Rockport Focus trait list. The large sample involved
makes it possible to be more specific about traits shared
with the Brownsville Focus to the south (Starr and Fresno
points, tiny end-scrapers, bipointed flint drills, shell disks,
and shell disk beads) and with the Central Texas Aspect of
interior Texas (Perdiz, Cliffton, ScaHorn, Fresno, and Young
arrowpoints). The large sample of Rockport pottery adds
specific detail to knowledge of the types previously described. The rarity of Rockport Incised pottery on these
islands suggests that we are near the southwestern periphery
of a decorative technique that is probably derived from the
incised pottery of the Galveston Bay Focus. Little light is
shed on the problem of the origin of painted pottery on the
Texas coast, but the intrusive sherd of polychrome pottery
from Chihuahua suggests diffusion from an area other than
the eastern coast of Mexico, its most likely source.
In the absence of stratigraphic data, it is impossible to
estimate in years the probable time range of human occupation of these islands in the Laguna Madre. As the Aransas
Focus as a whole contains a number of dar,t point styles that
are believed to be late in the Edwards Plateau Aspect (Ensor
and Darl) and in the Falc6n-Mier sequence (Matamoros and
Catan), it may be that the Aransas Focus as now known occupies only the latter part of the Archaic Stage. The Rockport occupation at these islands shows little evidence of
European contact, but it is likely that the islands were occupied at intervals well into historic time, which on the Texas
coast begins shortly after A. D. 1500.
