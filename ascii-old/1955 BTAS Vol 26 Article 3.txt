SCOTTSBLUFF POINTS IN THE OBSHNER
SITE NEAR DALLAS, TEXAS
WILSON w. CROOK, JR., AND R. K. HARRIS
The presence of certain projectile-point types, normally
considered as distinctive of Early Man sites on the High
Plains, in association with cultures of the non-pottery Archaic stage has become increasingly more common as the
study of these "intermediate" groups has progressed in
recent years in North America. (Many authorities object
to the term "Archaic," but until a better name is applied
it will be used in this paper).
These projectile points, whatever the cause of their occurrence in such associations, are most commonly of certain
specific types in a given area. For example, in Central
Texas, many Edwards Plateau Aspect associations seem to
carry a sprinkling of Angostura points, Plainview points,
and other types which appear related to "pure" Early Man
complexes elsewhere. In Northeast Texas, the Plainview
and Plainview-like points abound in Trinity Aspect Archaic
sites along the Upper Trinity River; Meserve points occur
sparsely along the Upper Trinity but heavily along the Red
River, especially in Lamar County, Texas; and a form of
Clovis point is often to be found in East Texas, particularly
along the upper reaches of the Sabine and Sulphur Rivers,
nearly always with Archaic material.
Scottsbluff projectile points are rare enough in Texas anywhere, including the High Plains region where so many
Early Man sites occur, and there has been archeological
curiosity concerning the sporadic finding of Scottsbluff
points in some numbers in Northwest Louisiana and the
adjacent border counties of Northeast Texas. Since such
specimens inevitably occurred in private collections with
no source recorded, or were found as seemingly unconnected
individual occurrences, nothing has been known of their
geologic or archeologic provenience in this region.
Therefore, the discovery of two bona fide Scottsbluff
points, one in place and the other essentially so for all prac-

76

tical purposes, in unquestionable association with a Carrollton focus complex in a site near Seagoville, Dallas, County,
Texas, has been of considerable interest. The recording of
this find is the purpose of this article. That a reworked
Clovis (?) point also occurred in place, and a Meserve-like
point apparently reworked from a large Plainview was
found essentially in place, heightens interest in the locality.
THE LOUIS OBSHNER SITE
Just south of Seagoville, Texas (Figs. 2, 3), the Louis
Obshner site (27A6-13) lies in the Union Terminal-Carrollton (T-1) terrace at an elevation of some 40 feet above the
present-day flood-plain (T-0 terrace). The site is a buried
one. No artifacts are observed upon the surface, and all
cultural debris is exposed by extensive gully erosion and
digging.
Without question, the site is a Carrollton focus component, as at least one specimen of every known Carrollton
focus trait has been recovered to date, with the sole exception of drills made from repainted broken dart points.
Only one object not commonly associated with the Carrollton focus has been found here (a single quartz crystal
to be discussed later) , and there is no evidence whatsoever
of any other cultural component being present at the site.
Until recently, the site was not distinguished by any particular abnormality other than extensive cultural debris eroded
from the sides of the gully system, the fact that it appeared
to be an early-phase Carrollton site occurring exclusively
in the Albritton clay formation, and that its surface was on
the contact line with the overlying Pattillo sand.
In May, 1954, the Dallas Archeological Society conducted
its annual group dig at the site, sinking some 16 test pits
in an effort to explore what seemed to be an important
Carrollton focus Archaic site. This test-pitting was a remarkable stroke of good fortune in light of the subsequent
discovery and excavation of a Scottsbluff point in place
nearly adjacent to two of the recorded test pits from the
dig, both of which yielded artifacts in undisturbed cultural

zones of identical depth and provenience. A large reworked
Plainview point, with ground base and basal edges, which
is considered as having been essentially in place, also was
adjacent to the same two pits. A Scottsbluff point not in
place, but likewise considered essentially so, was immediately adjacent to another test pit which-while it yielded
no artifacts-definitely located the cultural zone in the area
by the number of flakes and debris encountered at specific
levels, and their total absence in the overlying Pattillo formation at this spot. A reworked fluted Clovis point found
in place was not near any of the test pits, but occurred at
a comparable depth in the same geologic formation from
which the test pits produced cultural material. Both of the
Scottsbluff points and the reworked Clovis and Plainview
points were exposed by the continuing erosion of gully
walls, and the test pit material confirms the apparent
provenience of these specimens.
A good percentage of all artifacts from the Obshner site
have been found in situ in the gully walls, and these plus
the materials excavated in the test pits have given a clear
picture of the occurrence of the cultural level. Without exception, no artifact has been found to occur above the Albritton-Pattillo contact line. Artifacts; flint and quartzite
chips, flakes , and broken cores and cobbles; hearth stones;
clay "blobs"; and flecks of charcoal, occur in the topmost
two-thirds of the red sandy Albritton formation clay. These
evidences seem to reach their culmination at the surface
of the Albritton clay, but do not seem present whatsoever
in the succeeding Pattillo sand formation. In this respect
the site appears comparable with the Bachman's Dam site
of Carrollton focus affiliation which yielded such an excellent basal half of a Plainview point, and a questionable
Eden stem fragment.
Only where natural erosion processes or artificial digging (by archeological test pits and nearby gravel operations) have exposed the Albritton clay, do artifacts and
debris occur. Thus it is rather safe to observe that human
occupation of the site began sometime after the commence-

ment of the Albritton formation deposition, increased in intensity as the formation continued to be built up, until it
reached a climax upon the final surface of the Albrittononly to be abandoned before the succeeding Pattillo formation deposition began.
ARTIFACT ASSEMBLAGES,
In all, 63 dart points, three projectile-point blanks, eight
Clear Fork gouges, two finely-chipped gravers, four flake
scrapers, two crude "Waco net-sinkers," four Carrollton axes
of the single-bitted type (Crook and Harris, 1954b), 10 large
side-scrapers, 12 large knife blades, a number of clay "blobs,"
a part of a large "eared" projectile point, and a single quartz
crystal have come irom the site. These duplicate almost
precisely in classes, proportions, and techniques, all of the
trait items defined for the Carrollton focus, with the exception of the absence as yet of drills made from repainted
broken dart points, and the presence of the one exotic
quartz crystal. Even the percentages of flint-quartzite-petrified wood in the projectile points almost exactly match
those of the Wheeler and Lake Dallas type sites for Carrollton focus (Crook and Harris, 1952, 1954a, 1954b; Crook
1952) . Likewise, the percentages of occurrence of earlyprojectile point forms, points with ground edges on the
bases and stems, and those with beveled or " twisted" blades,
seem almost identical.
Of the total assemblage, fortunately , 11 proj ectile points,
five gouges, one net-sinker, four blades, one flake scraper,
and one side scraper have been recovered in situ either in
the gully walls or in test pits. In addition, a large number of
flakes, cobbles and cores, hearth stones, and charcoal flecks
have likewise been observed in situ. Two more projectile

Carrollton focus trait list, have been found at the Obshner site,

points can almost be classed as being in place due to the
nature of their finding.
At Location "A", in the sheer wall of the main gravel pit
(Fig. 3), the mid-section of a broken dart point of a Carrollton focus type (Plate 13, No. 1) was literally hacked
out of the tough Albritton clay at a depth of 24 inches below the Albritton-Pattillo contact line. The Albritton formation here is some 36 inches in thickness.
A hearth of burned stones occurred at a depth of 24 inches
in the Albritton formation at Location "B", exposed in the
eroded wall of a small gravel pit (Fig. 3). Firmly imbedded
in the tough red Albritton clay, amongst the actual hearth
stones at this location, was another broken projectile point
of a Carrollton focus type with ground stem edges (Plate
13, No. 2). Just south of the hearth, at a depth of 9Yz inches
below the Albritton surface, was a broken blade in situ; and
a few feet north of the hearth, a broken projectile point at
a depth of 9 inches below the Albritton surface (Plate 13,
No. 3). Here, too, the Albritton formation is about 36 inches
in total thickness.
Location "C" (Fig. 3) has been the most prolific producer
of artifacts in situ. Here, in the deep side-arm of the main
gully system, four complete Carrollton focus dart points,
two of which have ground stems, have been removed from
the gully walls (Plate 13, Nos. 4-7) at depths of 14, 12, 12,
and 12 inches respectively, in the Albritton clay. AdditionPLATE 11

ally, one gouge was found in place at a depth of 11 inches
in the Albritton clay at this location, and a broken one 15
inches deep; a third gouge occurred one inch deep in the
Albritton, just below the Pattillo contact. A broken twothirds of a knife blade was again literally hacked from the
tough Albritton clay at a depth of 27 inches (Plate 14,
Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6). Unpictured is a crude net-sinker from 11
inches deep. The Albritton exhibits a 30 inch thickness at
this location.
Innumerable cobbles, broken cores, and flakes . .. to say
nothing of charcoal specks ... have been observed in place
in the gully walls at Location "C", at depths varying from
practically at the surface of the Albritton formation to as
deep as 20 inches within it.
This extremely prolific Location "C" also has a large
amount of slope-wash debris of chips, flakes, cores, etc.,
where erosion has removed the Albritton clay. This "rich
spot" has been especially watched on nearly every weekend collecting trip for several years. It had been carefully
searched by the authors on one weekend in 1953. Heavy
local rains then fell, and on the following weekend a projectile point (Plate 13, No. 12) was discovered freshly
washed out of the Albritton clay slope. This appears to
have been originally either a Clovis point or a large variant
of the Plainview type which was broken and subsequently
given a new tip. It was unquestionably derived from the
Albritton formation, as-at the position of discovery-no
remnant of the Pattillo formation remains today on the
gully lip above, and the probable original position of the
find had been carefully scrutinized the preceding week before the rains. Hence this specimen is also treated as essentially in situ. Based upon its discovery position, it must
have come from the uppermost 12 inches of the Albritton
formation.
The knowledge of this "rich spot" prompted its selection
as the site of the annual group dig of the Dallas Archeological Society in May, 1954. While the chain of test pits was

84

designed to transect the terrace surface from the river side
across the gully system, two pits (Fig. 3, Nos. 4 and 8) were
located on the promontory between the gully arms at Location "C". In Test Pit 4, a gouge was excavated at a depth
of 8 inches in the Albritton, a flake-scraper also at 8 inches,
and a large side-scraper at a depth of 11 inches; these were
in addition to numerous flakes, cores, and charcoal flecks
down to 17 inches in the Albritton (Plate 13, Nos. 9 and 10;
Plate 14, No. 2). In Test Pit 8, two knife blades were excavated at respective depths of 7 and 10 inches in the Albritton. At both test pit locations, the Pattillo sand formation
remained only as a sloped-off thickness of some three inches
above the Albritton contact line, totally disappearing in a
few more feet at the present edges of the gullies.
Somewhat higher on the terrace surface,
gouge (Plate 14, No. 3) was found beneath
ing of Pattillo sand, resting directly upon
Albritton surface. No chips or flakes , even,
covering Pattillo layer.

In June, 1955, another Carrollton focus dart point was discovered in place in the wall of a small gravel test at Location "E" (Fig. 2). This point (Plate 13, No. 8) was exposed
11 inches below the Albritton surface in the exposed wall
of the pit; the surface Pattillo sands exhi bit an 8-inch thickness in this pit, while the underlying Albritton clays are
some 30 inches in depth.
Also in June of 1955, the second Scottsbluff point was
found at Location "F" (Fig. 2) , lying in a small erosion
gully. This point had been apparently weathered out by
heavy rains occurring two days previous to the find, and
was not exposed the preceding week when the authors
specifically searched this spot due to the large numbers of
flakes and other debris beginning to show at this point of
fresh erosion. Cattle grazing on the site had been using
this new, incipient gully as a trail; their footprints were
freshly preserved in the gully at the time the Scottsbluff
point was found, as though having been made after the pre-

viously-mentioned heavy rains which rendered the gully
materials soft. The point when found was freshly broken
in two parts which fit together perfectly (Plate 12, Nos.
2, 2a). The flint surface had been heavily patina ted in a
sharply contrasting color to the exposed interior of the
fresh breaks. There seems little question that the point
eroded out during the heavy rains five days after the authors had searched the spot, and that a cow stepped upon
the exposed point, breaking it, shortly after the rains in
the two days before the discovery.
Adjacent to this particular gully, Test Pit 6 was dug on
the occasion of the Dallas Society's group dig. As revealed
by the records of this pit, the surface Pattillo sand is present
as a 6-inch layer, underlain by 30 inches of Albritton red
clays. No chips or materials of human origin whatsoever
were encountered in Test Pit 6 in the Pattillo, yet a number
were found in the Albritton to depths of 12 inches below
its surface. Since the Scottsbluff point's position as found
was but 20 inches below the top of the Albritton in the
gully, it seems rather conclusive that this particular specimen was derived from a former position in the upper 12
inches of the Albritton in this gully. Thus it is also treated
as "essentially" in situ for the purposes of association.
At Location "G" (Fig. 3), in July of 1955, the bare edge
of a projectile point was found protruding from the sharp
gully bank at a depth of 14Y2 inches below the Albritton
surface, following more heavy rains. Upon excavation
(Plate 11, D, F), this point proved to be of the Clovis fluted
type, with a blunt, seemingly re-chipped tip. The basal
fluting is an inch long on each side and the edges are
ground for a comparable length (Plate 13, No. 11) . At this
location the surface Pattillo sand is some four inches thick
and well-marked; the underlying Albritton clay is approximately 30 inches thick.
THE SCOTTSBLUFF POINTS
So far, only the second Scottsbluff point has been discussed. The first one was found as follows: On Wednesday,

88

Texas Archeological Society

January 5, 1955, Harris celebrated a day off from work by
visiting the "rich spot" at the Obshner site. There, freshly
exposed in the gully wall at Location "C", he observed a
few millimeters of a flint projectile-point base protruding at
a depth of some 8 inches below th e Albritton formation surface. After careful, partial excavation with a hand-trowel,
he exposed enough of the stem and shoulder to arouse his
suspicions that the point was a Scottsbluff, at which time
he left and telephoned Crook to "come quick" with camera
and equipment to verify what might be a momentous find .
Together, the authors completed the exposure of the projectile point, finding it to be truly a Scottsbluff point (Plate
12, Nos. 1, 1-A). The find was a particularly happy event
in that it occurred unmistakably in situ. Over 80 per cent
of its total length projected inward into the gully wall,
itself a sheer erosional face of very dense clay. It was
within a very few inches of the previous occurrence of some _
four projectile points of Carrollton focus types and two
gouges in the gJ.llly face, apparently sandwiched horizontally betw~en these and the edge of Test Pit 4. The test pit
had approached the same gully wall within 24 inches. The
stakes in Plate 11, A mark the location of Test Pits 4 and 8,
showing their proximity to the Scottsbluff find.
Not only did the gully wall, when excavated to remove
the Scottsbluff point, reveal a knife blade at the same level
and chips, flakes, cores, and charcoal flecks both above and
below (Plate 11, B, C), but all these objects were between
the Albritton surface and a maximum depth of 20 inches
into this formation. The records of previous finds in situ in
the same gully wall and closely adjacent test pits showed
artifact occurrence at the same levels and deeper, yet all
unquestionably of Carrollton focus derivation. No question
could thus remain about the association of the first Scottsbluff point and the accompanying Carrollton focus material.
The Scottsbluff point lay flat , with the upper surface
rather well patinated (Plate 12, No. 1) , while the under
side mainly retained its original honey color (Plate 12,

No. 1A). This strongly suggests that the point actually became patinated in place, suggesting some antiquity for the
discovery position. Admittedly, had the point patinated
elsewhere and later been acquired and dropped at the
finding location, the odds are 50-50 as to its fall upon the
then-surface, but a later find of a white flint blade, which
when broken, showed a heavily-patinated surface on both
sides, with "honey" flint in the center, somewhat supports
the theory of patination- in - place. True, this particular
"honey" flint is known to patinate "quickly", but to have
done so prior to the completion of the Albritton depositionto say nothing of its subsequent and permanent burial until
today by the overlying Patillo formation-suggests a considerable lapse of time.
The second Scottsbluff point (Plate 12, Nos. 2, 2A), considered as essentially in place, is more heavily patinated,
even, than the first. This is excellently demonstrated in the
fresh break attributed to a cow stepping upon it wherein
the interior displays the original color of the flint-almost
blue-black in striking contrast to the dull creamy tan of
the surface. One side is again more altered than the other,
but in this specimen both sides are quite well patinated.
As we do not know the position in which it lay prior to
eroding out, no inferences may be drawn.
The excavated Scottsbluff point is 98 mm. long, 25 mm.
wide at its widest part, and 7 mm. thick at its thickest
section. The second Scottsbluff point is 104 mm. long, 27
mm. wide, and 9 mm. thick. Their shape and apparent degree of patination compare most favorably with the specimens shown in Moss (1951, Plate I , Nos. 4 and 5 from left
in upper panel), and with Type B in the lower panel of the
same publication, reprinted from Howard and Hack (1943).
The two Obshner specimens fall in the range of the Scottsbluff type recovered from the Finley site at Eden, Wyoming,
and would be indistinguishable if placed among the larger
specimens from this famous locality.
Neither the seemingly reworked Clovis point nor the

92

Texas Archeological Society

reworked Plainview point show s any detectable patina, due
possibly to their being light-colored flints which may not
patinate readily or show it to the eye. Most of the Carrollton focus points from the site are also of light-colored flint
or quartzite (which seemingly does not patinate) and do
not show any alteration, although one (Plate 13, No. 5)
appears to carry a light film of patina, especially on both
sides of the proximinal blade end.
GEOLOGY OF THE OBSHNER SITE
The section of the Union Terminal-Carrollton (T-1) terrace at the Obshner site is perfectly typical of the Upper
Trinity system-a basal Hill gravel; next, the Lower Shuler
laminated yellow sands ; then the Upper Shuler yellow
sandy clay with included caliche nodules; a strong erosional
break; the Albritton red sandy clay; and finally the Pattillo
grey sands at the surface.
The only remarkable feature is the evidence of a gullyerosion sequence at the Obshner arch eological site which can
best be explained by a theoretical sequence of springs and
their consequent secondary erosion and deposition.
At present, the archeological site is concentrated along
a marked gully system which lies somewhat back from the
T-1 terrace drop-off relief above the Floodplain. This is in
general contrast to the known common occurrence of Trinity Aspect sites being located on terrace T-1 near where a
tributary stream (either present or extinct) cuts through
it to reach the present valley . Site materials do sparsely
occur on the eroded and exposed slopes of terrace T-1 , but
are mainly concentrated along the gullies which are cut into
these slopes.
Today the artifact-bearing gully is a dry wash. Immediately to the north, and joining the dry wash before its entrance into the valley below, is a present-day minor channel
which has its origin in a spring-seep considerably upgr ade
from the site.

It is obvious fr om an examin ation of the site's gully
walls that the presen t dry wash-along which the site is
concentrated-is a r esult of r elatively recent erosion which
h as re-cut the soft, secondary fill of a former gully. Thus,
for convenience, w e shall r efer to the older on e as gully
No. 1 and the presen t one as gully No. 2.

In recapitulation of the geological chronology of th e site,
the Trinity River cut deeply into its valley to establish
terrace T-2; then the successive depositions of Hill gravels,
Lower Shuler laminated yellow sands , and Upper Shuler
yellow clays with caliche-each separated fr om the other
by a minor erosional surface-built up a floodplain which
is essentially the basis for the present T-1. Then, a major
erosion occurred, during which the Trinity retrenched its
valley, established the T-1 relief, and created gully No. 1
. . . apparently a somewhat shallow, wide ''draw" which
may well have been the result of seepage springs at this
formerly-high ground-water level. Certain evidences, such
as the development of a thin ironstone crust over a seeming
erosional surface as exposed today in the gully just above
the site, suggest such a condition at the close of Upper
Shuler times, corresponding to the first gully erosion to
be observed.
Deposition of the red sandy Albritton clays then began,
eventually almost choking gully No. 1. During this period
the occupation of the Obshner site began along the gully
sides, perhaps along the edges of a spring branch, near
where its head was then. This Albritton deposition almost
filled gully No. 1, and the human occupation culminated
upon its surface, still adjacent to what must have been a
spring-branch. This is the most logical explanation of the
development of a "draw" of such length, though actual terrace-erosion gullies of shorter length and deeper penetration might have occurred on the actual terrace slopes.
A period of stabilization or halt then ensued, durin g which
the Albritton formation was slightly sloped-off and the
human occupation ceased.

Again renewed deposition by the Trinity Riv er laid d own ,
at this particular locality, a thin covering of Pattillo sa nd
over the slopes of the T-1 terrace and the nearly-filled
"draw", covering the former human occupation surface and
almost totally eliminating the gradient of the "draw".
Since this time the remaining relief of T-1 has been cut,
the Carter formation deposited in the floodplain , and today's Trinity channel developed. Up on the terrace at the
Obshner site, gully No. 2 has been cut, stabilized, and a very
recent renewed gully-cutting initiated.
From the archeological evidence afforded above, it is obvious that the human occupation began relatively early in
the filling of gully No. 1 by the Albritton formati on . This
occupation continued with increasing concentration until
the completion of the deposition of the Albritton clay, and
for an undetermined time thereafter, upon its surface. However, before the deposition of Pattillo sands further obliterated gully No. 1, th e occupation had apparently ceased.
Should the authors' current theory concerning sea-levelaffected Gulf Coast stream systems be valid, then the several depositions of the Trinity (and other nearby streams
physically removed from the direct influence of the continental and alpine glaciers) represent waning-retreat periods of the Wisconsin-Recent glaciations. Hence the Albritton formation possibly represents the deposition connected with the waning-retreat of the W/4 or Mankato,
certainly in any case the early Post-Glacial period. Invoking the reasoning based upon available radiocarbon dates,
deposition of the Albritton formation must have taken place
some time later than 7,500 B. C.
It is indeed unfortunate that the red sandy clays of the
Albritton formation have apparently been so unfriendly to
the preservation of bone material everywhere along the
Trinity, allowing absolutely no paleontological check upon
possible geologic assignments. To date no fragments of
bone larger than one's thumbnail have been recovered in
the formation , hence identifications have been impossible.

Absolutely nothing is known of the fauna present in the
area during this period, yet from the numbers of projectile
points and scrapers recovered in place, hunting of some
fashion must have been important. At the Milton site, between Obshner and Dallas, the much-battered distal end of
what seems to be a proboscidean leg bone was recovered
in place in the basal 6 inches of the Albritton; its uniqueness to date and very location at the base of the Albritton
renders this specimen highly suspect as a wash-in from the
underlying Upper Shuler which has yielded semi-articulated
skeletons of Elephas columbi.
The overlying Pattillo grey sands have been little better
in providing faunal identifications with archeological sites.
Two partial human skulls of a long-headed, keel-vaulted
type, plus fragmentary human leg bones, several bison
teeth, a possible horse tooth, and fragments of antler complete the meager list of finds . The human remains are not
as yet distinctive of geologic periods; the bison teeth while
as large as specimens collected from B. taylori horizons at
Clovis, Lubbock, and Plainview, and larger than those found
in recent pottery-bearing sites of the region, are not considered definitive of species by expert paleontologists; the
horse tooth is a single occurrence, not worthy of large-scale
deductions and assignments; and the antler fragments are
not identifiable as to species.
Pursuing this geologic supposition, however, logic dictates that the Obshner site was occupied by the Carrollton
focus from late in the early Post-Glacial to approximately
middle Post-Glacial times. If this is tenable, the Scottsbluff
point and reworked Clovis point found in place would date
from about 5,500 B. C., entirely in accord with the known
radiocarbon dates for Scottsbluff and mixed Eden-Scottsbluff sites on the High Plains.
While it is a truism that an archeological site is dated by
the latest object present, in this particular problem as yet
no radio-carbon date has been produced to demonstrate how
late the beginning of Carrollton focus actually was, nor, for

that matter, the beginning date for any other Archaic complex in Texas. In addition, no one has yet ventured a real
explanation of the in situ mixture of Scottsbluff, Clovis,
Folsom, and Archaic-type projectile points with extinct
fauna at the Berclair Terrace site in Bee County, Texas.
CONCLUSIONS AND COMPARISONS
An explanation for the presence of Scottsbluff points at
the Obshner site is patently demanded (as well as for the
Scottsbluff specimens found in Northwest Louisiana and
East Texas), and several conclusions can be reached. (A)
The points were "pick-ups" from an earlier site in the
vicinity, though no such site has been discovered yet in
this region; or (B) the points were a result of trade contact
and/or cultural overlap at a later date in the area when
both cultures were present.
The latter explanation seems most feasible in light of the
possible geologic interpretations, the remarkable "coincidence" of the continuing finds of "Early" points in association with Archaic sites, and the as-yet-unexplained occurrence of considerable numbers of Scottsbluff points in
Northwest Louisiana and adjacent East Texas on upland
sites with undetermined provenience (Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks, 1954, pp. 146-147).
Northwest Louisiana and adjacent East Texas also have
yielded a number of occurrences of Clovis and Clovis-like
points. Their apparent presence at Obshner, along with
Scottsbluff points, plus the unmistakable Clovis point from
the Carrollton focus site at Melaun in Dallas County, does
not therefore seem an archeological peculiarity. Explanations of the occurrences present a very definite difficulty,
though perhaps magnified by the established associations
on the High Plains.
While not necessarily relevant to the problem at Obshner,
stemmed projectile points of essentially Archaic types have
been found in the lowest levels of a rock shelter in Southem Illinois, dated by radio-carbon as early as 8,800 B. C.

Stemmed ''Archaic" points have also been found in Missouri
and Indiana, possibly associated with remains of Mastodon
americanus (Gross, 1951). Since certain High Plains "Yuma"
sites have been dated by radiocarbon as late as 4,800 B. C. ,
possible overlap with the Archaic stage is not entirely out
of the question. More datings are needed!
At any rate, knowing that an early version of the Archaic
stage once existed over East Texas-witness certain sites in
Van Zandt County, Gregg County, Hopkins County, Titus
County, etc.-it is not without logic to suspect that the
Scottsbluff points found in Northwest Louisiana and adjacent East Texas were provided by an Archaic culture in
some way related to the period of the Carrollton focus on
the Upper Trinity River. In the later Archaic manifestations, complete with large numbers of Gary points, polished
stone, etc., which submerged these earlier cultures in the
area, such remnant traits almost totally disappeared.
