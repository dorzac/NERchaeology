Abstract
On August 31st through September 2nd, 2009, the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at
Texas State University-San Marcos (University) monitored the excavation of a trench measuring 1.5
meters by 2.25 meters on behalf of the University. The trench was excavated in response to a leaking
water line, near the University-owned fish ponds. As a political subdivision of the State of Texas, this
development by the University is subject to provisions of the Texas Antiquities Code. Work was carried
out by Jon C. Lohse, who served as Principal Investigator; Julian A. Sitters, who served as Project
Archaeologist; and CAS Staff Archaeologist, David M. Yelacic, under Texas Antiquities Permit No.
5385.
Monitoring of the trench excavation revealed mottled sediments overlying an old “T”-joint in the
line that supplies water to the fish ponds. Cultural materials were present, but appear to be out of
context. Based on these results, CAS concludes that the mechanical excavation did not impact any
cultural properties or resources considered significant to the city’s, state’s, or nation’s history.

the surface, and often times much less, whereas
the current undertaking extended 130 cmbs.
Additionally, maintenance work by the University
in 2009 to repair another broken water line near the
current project area exposed buried, prehistoric
remains that include diagnostic projectile points
and flaking debris. These remains, too, were
disturbed yet contained previously unrecorded
time-diagnostic information about prehistoric
activity in the vicinity. Finally, in 1982, the
interred remains of two prehistoric individuals
were inadvertently discovered during excavation
of irrigation lines and routine maintenance at
the fishery ponds (Garber and Glassman 1992).
Together, these projects and their findings
demonstrate the possibility that cultural remains
may be present in the current project area
(Figure 2) that, even if disturbed, could still offer
significant information concerning prehistoric
occupations. In addition to recording possibly
time-diagnostic data, a distinct possibility existed
that the repair work could encounter undisturbed
deposits. Accordingly, the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) recommended that CAS

On August 31st and September 1st and
2nd, the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS)
at Texas State University-San Marcos (University)
performed archaeological monitoring work for the
repair of a minor water line leak located between
berms separating historic fish ponds on the lower
portion of the Texas State University-San Marcos
campus. The project area is on the first terrace
of the San Marcos River, immediately below its
headwaters at Spring Lake, in San Marcos, Hays
County, Texas (Figure 1).
The repair work took place in an area where
significant, intact cultural deposits were expected,
but that also contains the potential for heavily
disturbed remains to be present near the surface.
An earlier archaeological monitoring project took
place only a few tens of meters of the proposed
repair (Yelacic et al. 2008) that observed what
appeared to be redeposited sediments. However,
that project extended no more than 50 cm below

methods used in gathering data, and presents
the results. Monitoring was performed by the
Principal Investigator Dr. Jon C. Lohse, Project
Archaeologist Julian A. Sitters, and David M.
Yelacic.

The trench that was opened to locate and
repair the leaking water line measured 1.5 m
wide, 2.25 m long, and was approximately 1.3
m deep; it resulted in a relatively minor impact
to the surrounding area. The project area proved
to have been disturbed by the installation of the
system of water lines, and also by the addition of
a paved sidewalk.

the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
and adopted by the THC, this report provides

Regulatory Overview

Archaeological sites may be considered
significant and be recognized or designated as
State Archaeological Landmarks, provided that
at least one of the following conditions is met
(Rules and Practice, Chapter 41:10):

Cultural resources located on land owned or
controlled by the State of Texas or its political
subdivisions are protected by the Texas Antiquities
Code (TAC) (Texas Natural Resources Code, Title
9, Chapter 191), which identifies significant sites as
State Archaeological Landmarks (SALs). Should
any historic or prehistoric sites located on land
that is designated for impact during development
be determined eligible for formal designation of
landmark status under the TAC, some measure
of protection or mitigation of impact may be
necessary. The formal designation of SALs and
their administration is the responsibility of the
Texas Historical Commission (THC).

The archaeological site is situated on land
owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one
of its political subdivisions; [and then]
(a) preservation of materials must be
sufficient to allow application of standard
archaeological techniques to advantage; and/or
(b) the majority of artifacts are in place
so that a significant portion of the site’s
original characteristics can be defined through
investigation; and/or
(c) the site has the potential to contribute
to cumulative cultural history by the addition of
new information; and/or

As a political subdivision of the State of Texas,
development of property by the University falls
under the purview of the TAC. The TAC requires
that projects undertaken by such political entities
consider the impact of those projects on any
cultural resources that might be present and that
might contribute information that is meaningful
or significant to understanding the history and
prehistory of the State of Texas.

(d) the site offers evidence of unique or rare
attributes; and/or
(e) the site offers a unique or rare
opportunity to test techniques, theory, or method
of preservation, thereby contributing to scientific
knowledge.

The TAC generally requires that a complete
archaeological survey be performed in
conjunction with projects which fall under its
purview, particularly in previously unsurveyed
areas and in project areas where cultural resources
are expected. Any resources determined to be
significant must then be avoided, protected, or
their destruction mitigated by approved data
recovery programs. In certain cases, including
the current undertaking, monitoring is sufficient
to record any information that may be present.
Worthiness for designation as a SAL is defined
in the TAC:

The monitoring work described herein was
performed under auspices of Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 5385, granted to Jon C. Lohse of
CAS.

Project Area Setting

remnants of the oldest Federal fish hatchery west
of the Mississippi, were constructed in 1893 and
currently support Cypress trees, koi fish, turtles,
geese, and ducks (Texas State University – San
Marcos 2008) (Figure 3).

The City of San Marcos is located in Hays
County, in southeast-central Texas. The San
Marcos River, which is less than 200 m to the
east of the current project area, is fed by an
artesian spring which marks the boundary
between the Edwards Plateau (Hill Country)
and the Blackland Prairie. Ecotonal zones such
as this one, comprising transitions between two
adjoining large-scale environmental provinces,
are understood as high-energy settings capable of
supporting tremendous diversity in terms of plant
and animal species (Crumley 1994). Accordingly,
they also represent likely areas for supporting
dense human occupations during both historic
and prehistoric times.

Hydrology
San Marcos Springs, also known by the
European settlers as St. Mark’s, by the Tonkawas
as Canocanayesatetlo, and currently as Aquarena
Springs, have attracted human populations for
at least the last 8,000 years (Brune 2005). As
described by Brune (2005), the springs were
important stops on El Camino Real and the
Chisholm cattle trail. They are the second largest
springs in Texas and support a tremendous
amount of wildlife. The San Marcos Springs are
the headwaters of the San Marcos River which
has provided power to gins, corn, saw, and grist
mills, and an ice factory in relatively recent
history.

Soils
The current project area’s soils are entirely
within the Tinn (Tn) Series which are typically
found on floodplains (Batte 1974). As described
by Batte (1974), the Tinn series are deep, poorly
drained, and nearly level clayey soils formed in
calcareous clay alluvium. The surface layer is
made up of dark gray clay about 25 inches thick
and overlies a 55 inch thick layer of grayish
brown clay.

Central Texas Cultural
Chronology

The cultural chronologies for Central and
South Texas are not completely understood or
agreed upon. However, archaeological deposits
indicate rich cultural development. Black (1995),
Hester (1995, 2004), and Collins (1995, 2004)
present the most recent syntheses of the available
chronological evidence of archaeological culture
history in the region. The following cultural
chronology is based on Black (1995), Hester
(1995, 2004), and Collins (1995, 2004).

Flora and Fauna
Although the project area is in the
aforementioned ecotonal zone and has the
potential to support tremendous floral and
faunal diversity, it has been disturbed by several
different developments. As a result, no natural
vegetation remains. The fishponds, which are
?

to be nomadic cultures that
relied heavily on hunting large
game animals (Black 1989).
Recent research has shown that
Paleoindian peoples also utilized
a wide variety of plants and
small game animals (Black 1989;
Bousman et al. 2004; Collins and
Brown 2000; Hester 1983).
The Late Paleoindian occurs
from
ca.10,000–8,000
BP.
Reliable evidence for these dates
was recovered from the WilsonLeonard site, north of Austin

archaeologists excavated an

and Late Prehistoric. The Paleoindian stage is
characterized by the earliest human occupation
of North America prior to 8,000 BP. The Archaic
stage follows, extending from ca. 8,000 BP to
Archaic
1,200 BP, and is generally seen as a time during
which humans made successful adaptations

habitats and the development of bow and arrow

important transitions: a shift from large game
hunting to hunting smaller animals; the increased
use of plant food resources and use of ground
stones in food processing; the implementation
of stone cooking technology; increased use of
organic materials for tool manufacturing and
an increase in the number and variety of lithic
tools for wood working; the predominance of
corner- and side-notch projectile points; greater

Paleoindian
Collins (1995:381–385, 2004) dates the
Paleoindian period to 11,500–8,800 BP in Central
Texas. Diagnostic artifacts observed from this
stage are associated with the Clovis, Folsom and
a variety of later Paleoindian cultures (Bousman
et al. 2004). The Early Paleoindian, consisting
of Clovis and Folsom, is generally understood

changes.

the bison and bison hunters retreated northwards.
By the latter part of the Middle Archaic, Taylor
bifaces were replaced by Nolan and Travis points
(Collins 1995, 2004). The Nolan-Travis interval
was a period when temperature and aridity were
at their greatest levels, and there is evidence of
increased utilization of xerophytes such as sotol
(Johnson and Goode 1994). During drier episodes,
the aquifer-fed streams and resource-rich
environments of Central Texas were extensively
utilized (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128).

Early Archaic
Hester (1995:436–438, 2004) defines the
Early Archaic with Early Basal Notched and Early
Corner Notched dart points dating between 7,950
and 4,450 BP, while Collins (1995:383, 2004)
argues that the Early Archaic spans from 8,800
to 6,000 BP based on three divisions of projectile
point types. It is generally believed that at the
beginning of the Holocene, a warming in climate
led to the extinction of large herds of megafauna,
and stimulated behavioral changes of hunters
and gatherers in south-central Texas (McKinney
1981). A dietary adjustment is evidenced by
the increased number of ground stone artifacts,
burned rock midden cooking features, and more
specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner and Hester 1993:246–
256). Early Archaic sites are thinly dispersed and
are seen across a wide area of Texas and northern
Mexico (Weir 1976).

Late Archaic
The Central Texas Late Archaic dates to
approximately 4,000–1,300/1,200 BP (Collins
1995:384, 2004). Herds of bison began returning
to the southern Great Plains, again influencing
the subsistence strategies (Dillehay 1974). Some
see cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte
(Hall 1981) and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988)
as evidence that populations increased and
that groups were becoming territorial (Story
1985:44–45). Others challenge the interpretation
by citing a decrease in burned rock middens
(Prewitt 1981:80–81). Pottery began appearing in
limited areas of the South Texas Plains; however,
most regions remained “pre-ceramic” for another
thousand years (Story 1985:45–47).

Middle Archaic
Collins (1995, 2004) divides the Middle
Archaic, 6,000–4,000 BP, into three projectile
point style intervals: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek;
Taylor; and Nolan and Travis. Later portions of
the Middle Archaic are marked by the onset of the
Altithermal, a very warm and dry period. The BellAndice-Calf Creek interval was a moist, mesic
period when grasslands expanded southwards into
Central and South Texas, followed by bison herds
from the Plains. Bell-Andice-Calf Creek peoples
were specialized bison hunters who followed the
herds southwards. As the Altithermal progressed,

Late Prehistoric
Collins (1995, 2004) dates the Late
Prehistoric in Central Texas at 1,300/1,200–260
BP, and follows Kelly (1947) in dividing it into
Austin and Toyah phases. The most significant
changes include a technological shift away from
the dart and atlatl to the bow and arrow and the
incorporation of pottery (Black 1989:32; Story
1985:45–47).

?

Austin Phase

seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
These encounters began with the venture into
Texas by the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
and the Narvaez expedition in 1528. The period
is generally dated between 1500 and 1700 (or
1528, the date of the Cabeza de Vaca/Narvaez
expedition, to the establishment of the first
Spanish mission, Mission San Antonio de Valero
in 1718).

The Austin phase is characterized by the
appearance of small arrow points. Burned rock
middens are occasionally found with these
types of points (e.g., Houk and Lohse 1993),
and ground and pecked stone tools used for
plant food processing are increasingly common.
Burials from this time reveal a high proportion of
arrow-wound deaths (Black 1989; Meissner 1991;
Prewitt 1974), suggesting that population growth
resulted in disputes over limited resources.

With Alonso de León’s expedition of 1680, El
Camino Real (the King’s Road) was established
from Villa Santiago de la Monclova in Mexico
to East Texas. This roadway followed established
Native American trade routes and trails and
became a vital link between Mission San Juan
Bautista in Northern Mexico and the Spanish
settlement of Los Adaes in East Texas (McGraw
et al. 1991).

Toyah Phase
The beginning of the Toyah phase (800 BP) in
Central Texas is discernible by contracting stem
points with flaring, barbed shouldered points.
This phase is also characterized by the common
occurrence of a technology focused on prismatic
blades, blade cores, and scrapers-on-blades, all
considered to be part of a specialized Toyah
bison hunting and processing toolkit (Black and
McGraw 1985; Huebner 1991; Ricklis 1994).
Toyah is also characterized by the appearance of
bone-tempered pottery in Central Texas (Johnson
1994:241–281). The wide variety of ceramic
styles and influences seen throughout Toyah
phase ceramic assemblages provide important
information on the social composition of these
groups (Arnn 2005). Toyah ceramic assemblages
display Caddo, Texas Gulf Coast, and Jornada
Mogollon influences (Arnn 2005).

Spanish priests accompanying entradas
provided the most complete information of
indigenous cultures of early Texas. Those
documented during the early entradas include the
Cantona, Muruam, Payaya, Sana, and Yojuane,
who were settled around the springs at San Marcos
and described as semi-nomadic bands. Other
tribes encountered at San Marcos included mobile
hunting parties from villages in South and West
Texas, such as Catequeza, Cayanaaya, Chalome,
Cibolo, and Jumano, who were heading for bison
hunting grounds in the Blackland Prairies (Foster
1995:265–289; Johnson and Campbell 1992;
Newcomb 1993). Later groups migrated into the
region and displaced the former groups or tribes.
These included the Tonkawa from Oklahoma and
Lipan and Comanche from the Plains (Campbell
and Campbell 1985; Dunn 1911; Newcomb 1961,
1993).

Protohistoric (Spanish Entrada
Period)
In Texas, the Protohistoric period was marked
by Spanish entradas, the formal expeditions from
established forts and missions in Northern Mexico
into Central, Coastal, and East Texas in the late
?

Previous Archaeological
Investigations

Archaeological sites dating to this period
typically contain a mix of both European
imported goods, such as metal objects and glass
beads, and traditional Native American artifacts,
such as manufactured stone tools.

The current project area, adjacent to
the spring-fed San Marcos River, has five sites,
41HY135, 41HY161, 41HY165, 41HY319, and
41HY432, within one kilometer. A brief description
of each site is presented using information from
the THC Archeological Site Atlas Database and
published technical reports.

Historic
Spanish settlement in Central Texas first
occurred in San Antonio with the establishment
of Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo)
in 1718, and the later founding of San Antonio
de Béxar (Bolton 1970; Habig 1977; de la Teja
1995). Some researchers demarcate the transition
in Texas between the Entrada (Protohistoric) and
Historic periods by the construction of the first
Spanish missions in Texas. Most knowledge of
this period is gained through the written records
of the early Spanish missionaries. Besides the
mission town of San Antonio, the only other
Spanish settlement in the region was San Marcos
de Neve, established in 1808, four miles south of
present day San Marcos. San Marcos de Neve was
abandoned in 1812 as a result of constant raids
by local tribes (Dobie 1932). During this time,
massive depopulation occurred among the Native
Americans, mostly due to European diseases to
which the indigenous people had little resistance.
Those few remaining were nearly all displaced to
reservations by the mid-1850s (Fisher 1998).

Site 41HY135, a State Archaeological
Landmark, was discovered at the confluence
of the San Marcos River and Purgatory Creek
(Warren 1977). The site, of unknown age,
consisted of a surficial lithic scatter and showed
evidence of disturbance by a sewer line, gravel
path, and natural erosion. Testing of the site
was recommended to further delineate it both
vertically and horizontally. Information on
further investigation of the site is not present on
the Database.
State Archaeological Landmark site
41HY161, just below the Ice House dam to the
south of the springs, was initially investigated by
Joel Shiner in 1978. His data showed a significant
amount of disturbance (Archaic artifacts were
found mixed with historic artifacts) (Bousman
2001). Starting in 1982, a series of field schools
directed by Dr. James Garber began to investigate
sites in San Marcos and included fieldwork at
41HY161 (Bousman, 2001). A decade later, in 1992,
Dr. Garber and Dr. David Glassman recovered
two burials from 41HY161. Preservation of bone
was moderate, but both burials were disturbed
and only partially recovered (Garber and
Glassman 1992). As described by Aery (2007),
prior to development in the late 1990s, testing of
the southwestern portion of the site revealed an
intact Late Archaic component overlying a Late

European presence in the region increased
as settlers received land grants from the Mexican
government until 1835. Settlement was difficult,
however, due to continuation of hostilities with
and raids by Native American tribes. The Texas
Rangers provided protection from these conflicts
after Texas secured independence from Mexico
in 1836. Settlement in the region increased until
1845, when Texas gained admission to the United
States, resulting in the formation of Hays County
in 1848 (Bousman and Nickels 2003).

Lyle et al. 2000). Eric Oksanen (2007) and Dave
Nickels supervised the most recent excavations of
site 41HY161 in 2004 during which, intact Early
Archaic deposits were encountered.

by Brian King (2007) the proximity and similar
depth suggest that 41HY432 is an extension of
41HY319.

In 1984, during a field school, Dr.
Garber recorded site 41HY165, now a State
Archaeological Landmark, on the southeast shore
of Spring Lake. At the time of recording, this
site was a surficial scatter of lithic debitage and
bifacial tools (Garber 1984). This site is a possible
extension of 41HY161. Further investigation in
the form of testing for vertical and horizontal
boundaries was recommended.

Methods

Archaeological monitoring of the
backhoe-excavated trench was necessary due
to time constraints. The entire digging process
was monitored in order to ensure that any
archaeological features or remains that were
present were recorded, and that any artifacts
could be recovered (Figure 4). In the event
that intact features or other significant cultural
deposits were noted, the digging process would
have stopped temporarily so that these could be
recorded. Photographs were taken throughout the
excavation of the trench.

The Center for Archaeological Studies
performed a survey along a portion of the San
Marcos River on behalf of the City of San
Marcos in 2001. Site 41HY319, a prehistoric site
of unknown age, was discovered during this work
(Barrera 2002). Beneath disturbed sediments, a
possible intact cultural deposit, represented by
lithic debitage, was found beginning at 50 cmbs
(centimeters below surface). Due to the shallow
nature of the proposed development and the
absence of temporally diagnostic
artifacts, no further work was
recommended (Barrera 2002).
In the spring of 2007,
site 41HY432 was discovered
by archaeologists from Hicks &
Co. while conducting a survey
on behalf of the City of San
Marcos. A combination of shovel
tests and mechanical excavation
revealed that site 41HY432 was
an undeterminable prehistoric
site (King 2007). As described

Figure 4. Excavation of trench.

?

Results

Sediments at this depth are black clay loam with
a Munsell reading of 10YR 2/1. They lack the
mottled appearance of overlying deposits, and are
furthermore below the lowest depth of the “T”Joint or other known disturbances. Excavations
into these undisturbed sediments did not extend
very far, and did not expose archaeological
features or clearly visible material remains.

Archaeological
monitoring
revealed
archaeological materials, consisting of both
historic and prehistoric materials, near the
surface. However, there is also a significant
amount of disturbance within the excavated
trench. Trench profiles revealed mottled
sediments that were composed primarily of clay
(Figure 5). Roots, calcareous pebbles/gravel, and
modern debris including construction fill were
found at various depths within the trench, all
the way down to ~88 cmbs (Figure 6). At this
depth, the pipeline T-Joint and construction fill
were encountered (Figure 7). The combination of
mottled sediments, construction fill, and historic
debris alongside lithic material clearly indicates
that the entire trench was excavated through an
area that had been previously disturbed.

Recommendations

Archaeological monitoring of a trench
excavation on University property adjacent to the
San Marcos River and three State Archaeological
Landmarks revealed that no prehistoric or
historic intact deposits are present in the area
of potential effect that can be construed as
potentially significant to the city or state’s history
under any criteria of the Texas Antiquities Code.
The trench excavation did not exceed ~126 cmbs
ultimately leaving the intact deposits undisturbed.
Accordingly, CAS concludes
that no additional archaeological
investigations are necessary.  

Despite these factors, CAS believes that intact
cultural remains still exist within the project area.
After careful examination of the trench profile it
is believed that intact deposits exist ~126 cmbs.
