Abstract
In October of 2017 AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an intensive
archeological survey of approximately 8.55 acres associated with the construction of a new
location roadway in Cameron County, Texas (CSJ: 0921-06-241). The proposed US77/83
South parallel Corridor will extend from Farm-to-Market (FM) 1479 (Rangerville Road) at
Thieme Road to FM 732 (Sherer Road) at FM 1577 (Pennsylvania Avenue) for a total project
length of approximately 7.3 miles. This new location roadway will require approximately 95
acres of newly proposed Right-of-Way. Roughly 82 percent, or 77 acres, of the proposed
new location roadway was previously surveyed. The current survey encompasses only 8.55
of the 18 remaining acres. AmaTerra conducted the archeological survey under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 8199.
Archeological investigations consisted of a thorough pedestrian survey and the excavation
of five backhoe trenches throughout the Area-of-Potential Effect (APE). Field archeologists
observed multiple landscape modifications associated with agriculture and irrigation. One
historic-age archeological site (41CF233) was recorded during field investigations. The
site consists of early twentieth-century domestic debris found on the surface mixed with
contemporary trash. A lack of features, dateable materials, intact archeological deposits,
or an association with historically significant figures has led AmaTerra to recommend the
portion of 41CF233 located within the APE ineligible for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places.
Based on the results of this survey, no additional archeological investigations within the
proposed APE are warranted at this time. No artifacts were collected during the survey.
All records, project notes, and photographs will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory in Austin.

Chapter 1

Introduction and Management Summary
In October of 2017, on behalf of L&G Engineers, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra)
conducted an archeological survey of approximately 8.55 acres associated with the
proposed construction of a new location roadway, US 77/83 South Parallel Corridor, in
central Cameron County, Texas (CSJ No: 0921-06-241; Figures 1 and 2). The project will
extend from Farm-to-Market (FM) 1479 (Rangerville Road) at Thieme Road to FM 732 (Sherer
Road) at FM 1577 (Pennsylvania Avenue), a distance of approximately 7.3 miles. The new
roadway would feature four, 12-foot-wide travel lanes with 10-foot outside shoulders and a
16-foot continuous center turn lane, and six-foot-wide sidewalks. The existing right-of-way
(ROW) encompasses 12 acres, while new ROW would cover approximately 95 acres within
a 120-foot wide corridor. All of the proposed new ROW is currently privately owned with the
exception of the section from FM 1479 to FM 509, which has already been constructed.

Previous Investigations
Various portions of the APE have been surveyed by different investigating firms. In 2007,
SWCA, Inc. (SWCA) surveyed approximately 40 acres (3.7 linear miles), of the APE (Antiquities
Permit No. 4707; Chavez 2011). The survey included a visual inspection of the ground
surface, shovel testing, and backhoe trenching. Field efforts produced no new cultural
resources, but SWCA did recommend additional survey for those portions of the APE (55
acres) where access was denied. In 2008, TxDOT and the THC concurred with SWCAâs
recommendations. Therefore in 2012, AmaTerra returned to the APE to survey those
portions of the APE inaccessible to SWCA in 2007 (Antiquities Permit No. 6331; Dowling
and Feit 2013). Minor design changes had occurred since the 2007 survey and AmaTerra
evaluated those areas as well. AmaTerra physically surveyed 20 acres, while an additional
17 acres were visually assessed as having low archeological potential and eliminated from
further consideration. In total, AmaTerra surveyed 37 acres, or 2.4 linear miles. No new
cultural resources were documented within the APE. However, access was unavailable for
a number of properties within the APE with moderate archeological potential. Therefore,
AmaTerra recommended additional work for those remaining 18 acres, or 1.2 linear miles.
In October of 2012, both TxDOT and the THC concurred with AmaTerraâs recommendations
for additional survey.
At the time of this survey, access was only available to 8.55 acres, or 0.57 linear miles.

Regulation
The project is being funded by Cameron County using Federal transportation funds and is
being reviewed by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) as part of the National
Environmental Policy Act environmental assessment. Since the project is being built with

Federal transportation money on land owned or controlled by the State of Texas, it is
considered an undertaking subject to the provisions outlined under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (Section 106), as well as the Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT). Therefore, AmaTerraâs work conformed to the guidelines under 36 CFR Part 800
and 13 TAC Chapter 26, which outline the regulations for implementing Section 106 and
the ACT respectively.
All work was conducted under the terms and conditions of the First Amended Programmatic
Agreement for Transportation Undertakings (2005; PA-TU) among the FHWA, TxDOT, the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and
the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and the THC.

Area of Potential Effects
This undertakingâs Area of Potential Effects (APE) for archeological resources is defined
as the footprint of the proposed project to the maximum depth of impact, including all
easements, utility relocations, and project specific locations. Therefore, the APE for
archeological resources will cover a total distance of approximately 7.3 miles and encompass
an area roughly 95 acres in size, within a 120-foot-wide corridor. The maximum depth of
impact is anticipated to extend to 45 feet below surface for bridge piers, and three to five
feet for the at-grade portion of the roadway. Therefore, the vertical APE ranges from five to
45 feet below surface. Typical sections are attached to this document (see Attachment).
For the sake of this archeological survey, the APE is defined as the approximately 8.55
acres where access was available.

Investigation Summary
Coordination with TxDOT resulted in a survey recommendation for the entire 8.55-acre APE.
The undertaking would be built on private property, of which, AmaTerra had access to 100
percent of the proposed APE at the time of survey. Per the request of TxDOT archeologists,
archeological investigations consisted of backhoe trenching within undisturbed portions
of the proposed APE. Archeologists excavated a total of five backhoe trenches within
the 120-foot-wide corridor. One new archeological site, 41CF233, was recorded during
field investigations. The site consists of early twentieth-century domestic debris found
on the surface mixed with contemporary trash. A lack of features, dateable materials,
intact archeological deposits, or an association with historically significant figures has
led AmaTerra to recommend the portion of 41CF233 located within the APE ineligible for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). No additional archeological work
is recommended for the APE at this time.
Field investigations took place from October 19-20, 2017 under Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 8199. AmaTerraâs Project Manager and Principal Investigator was Julian (Drew) Sitters.
Fieldwork was direct by Heath Bentley with assistance from Emory Worrell. A total of 34

person hours were expended in the field in support of this project. This was a no collection
survey; therefore, all artifacts were returned to their original location.
This report is divided into six chapters. The project background and cultural overview are
discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. Chapter 4 includes the field methodology implemented
during the project and the results of field investigations are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter
6 presents the summary and recommendations.

Project Background and Environmental Setting
Physiography
The APE is located within the Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain, a subregion of the
Western Gulf Coastal Plain ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). This ecoregion is a relatively flat
and narrow strip of land abutting the Gulf of Mexico (Griffith et al. 2007). Encompassing
only 690 square miles, the Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain is characterized by flat,
alluvial floodplains underlain by alluvial sands and clays. Elevation across this subregion
ranges from 10 to 120 feet Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL).

Vegetation
This ecoregion is characterized by its grassland potential near the coast with a forest
or savanna-like vegetation farther inland. Historically, natural vegetation consisted of
floodplain forests composed of palm trees or Texas palmetto (Sabal mexicana), Texas
ebony (Pithecellobium flexicaule), tepeguaje (Leucaena pulverulenta), anacua (Ehretia
anacua), sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), and Mexican
ash (Fraxinus berlandieriana) with some mesquite-mixed shrub savanna consisting
of mesquite (Prosopis spp.), granjeno (Celtis pallida), and snake eyes (Phaulothamnus
spinescens). â[While] most [of the] large palm trees and floodplain forest had been cleared
by the early 1900sâ¦a few small pieces of these unique riparian woodlands remainâ (Griffith
et al. 2007: 80). Today, land use in the Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain is dominated
by cropland, producing citrus, cotton, grain sorghum, sugar cane, vegetables, melons, and
hay. Additional land cover consists of urban and industrial land use.

Climate
Climate within the Western Gulf Coastal Plain ecoregion is described as subtropical with
hot, usually humid and wet summers with mild to cool winters (Peel et al. 2007). Annually,
the APE receives roughly 20 to 25 inches of precipitation with maximum rainfall beginning
in late spring and continuing through into early autumn (AgSite 2017). The annual high
air temperature is roughly 83.9 degrees Fahrenheit with an annual low air temperature of
63.9 degrees Fahrenheit (U.S. Climate Data 2017).

Hydrology
Most of the Rio Grandeâs water is used for irrigation and urban use with very little of the
flow ever reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, âthe natural cycles of flooding have
been highly altered in this ecoregionâ (Griffith et al. 2007: 80). As a result, there has been
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

7

Archeological Survey 8.55 Acres: Proposed US 77/83 So Parallel Corridor from FM 1479 to FM 732, Cameron County, Texas

a reduction in the quality and number of wetlands, specifically the oxbow lakes known as
resacas, within this ecoregion. Also, the mesic riparian woodland trees have been replaced
by xeric species such as mesquite (Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988, cited in Griffith et al.
2007).
Resacas, or former channels of the Rio Grande, are unique to Cameron County. âThe word
stems from the Spanish resacar (âto retakeâ), since the primary geological function of
a resaca seems to be diversion and dissipation of floodwater from the riverâ (Robinson
2017). Beginning in the early twentieth century, resacas began functioning as reservoirs
and channels for irrigation. With no inlet or outlet, resacas remain dry or as stagnant
ponds and marshes for most of the year except in rainy weather. Thus, resacas serve as
crucial habitats for wildlife including waterfowl, beaver, nutria, amphibians, reptiles, and
fish (Robinson 2017). Most of the water used for irrigation travels through two drainage
structures: the Arroyo Colorado and the North Floodway.

Geology and Soils
Located within the Rio Grande Drainage Basin, the APE is relatively flat and underlain by
flood deposits, or Holocene-age alluvium composed of mud (Qam), and silt and sand (Qas;
BEG 1976). According to the United States Department of Agriculture â Natural Resources
Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) Web Soil Survey (2017), there are six named soil units
within the APE (Table 1; Figure 3). Soils are characterized by silt loam to silty clay loam
with restrictive features, such as clay, encountered at the surface.

Regional Chronology and Cultural Background
The project area is situated within the Coastal Texas archeological region (Perttula 2004).
This region can be further divided into the Central and Lower Texas Coast sub-regions
of which, the APE is located within the latter. The Lower Texas Coast archeological subregion encompasses the area south of Baffin Bay and extends south to the Rio Grande
(Ricklis 2004). Archeological data on this region is limited and regional chronology is
poorly understood. Much of the data from the region has been derived from surface
collections made by avocational archeologists such as A. E. Anderson, from which there is
little temporal data (Kumpe and Krzywonski 2010; Ricklis 2004). Paleoindian and Archaic
period artifacts often wash up on the beaches of South Padre island and are likely brought
in with the tide from submerged prehistoric sites.
Artifacts found at sites in the region indicate a coastal cultural tradition with an emphasis
on a specialized marine shell industry, which is often attributed to the Brownsville Complex,
which dates to the Late Prehistoric period (Kumpe and Krzywonski 2010; Ricklis 2004).
This industry includes a variety of shell tools including conch adzes, columella gouges,
hammers, and projectile points, horse conch siphonal end gouges, edge-flaked venus
clam and disk dosinia shells, giant eastern murex spine punches, containers made from
unmodified giant Atlantic cockle, southern quahog shell hammers, whelk whorl and river
mussel fishhooks, and oyster shell net weights (Kumpe and Krzywonski 2010; Ricklis
2004). Chert, which does not occur naturally along the coast, is used in the manufacture
of formal tools such as triangular and subtriangular dart and arrow points, small circular
unifaces and bifacially flaked pin-like drills (Kumpe and Krzywonski 2010; Ricklis 2004).
Shell artifacts have been recovered from as far west as Falcon Reservoir in Zapata County
(Boyd et. al 1997)
Additionally, sherds of Huastecan pottery from northeastern Mexico have been recovered
from surface sites in the delta, which likely indicates trade between the local peoples and
those of Huasteca (Ricklis 2004).
People of the Rio Grande delta subsisted through hunting, fishing and plant gathering
which was dependent on the seasonal availability of regionally specific resources. Likewise,
the collection of marine shells was dependent on the cold and warm water cycles that
kills some species resulting in the deposition of their shells on the shoreline. Mobility
patterns along the lower Texas Coast are still widely misunderstood, though according
to ethnohistorical research the region was home to a large population that exploited the
abundant resources along the coast (Kumpe and Krzywonski 2010; Ricklis 2004).

Historic
Cameron County was first visited by the Spanish on expeditions in 1638 and 1687. In 1765
the community of San Juan de los Esteros was established in present day Matamoros
Mexico, and subsequent land grants were issued north of the Rio Grande in modern
day Cameron County (Garza and Long 2010). The town of San Benito is located on the
ConcepciÃ³n de Carricitos grant that was awarded to Eugenio Fernandez in 1789 (Robinson
III 2010). Sparsely populated, the area was part of the Mexican state of Tamaulipas until it
was signed over to the Republic of Texas as part of the Treaties of Velasco in 1836. At this
time it was incorporated into San Patricio County. The area continued to be used as range
land for Mexican Rancheros until United States troops marched into the area in 1846 on
an expedition to solidify the U.S. claim on the disputed territory between the Nueces and
Rio Grande Rivers. At this time, Fort Brown was established in the location of what would
become Brownsville. The area was the site of skirmishes of the Mexican-American war,
as well as the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de Palma. In 1848 Cameron County was
officially established and incorporated into the United States (Garza and Long 2010).
The ConcepciÃ³n de Carricitos grant where current San Benito is located passed to
Judge Stephen Powers in exchange for legal services to the Fernandez heirs in the mid
nineteenth-century (Robinson III 2010). Cameron County suffered economic hardship in
the years following the Civil War. However, the economy was boosted in 1904 when the St.
Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway was built through the county, and many mid-western
farmers moved in and settled the area (Garza and Long 2010). In 1904 the San Benito Land
and Water Company was established over the ConcepciÃ³n de Carricitos land grant that
was then sold into lots beginning in 1907 (Robinson III 2010). The new wave of settlement
introduced large-scale truck farming, an extensive irrigation system and roadways to the
area at which point many citrus orchards were established (Garza and Long 2010). National
Guard troops were stationed in San Benito during border disturbances in 1915 and 1916,
and the town witnessed several fights between bandits and the Texas Rangers, as well as
lynchings and the explosion of the night train to Brownsville. The citrus industry led the
areaâs economy in the early twentieth-century and the town heavily exported vegetables
and citrus and was home to several agricultural festivals. The population of the area was
divided in the mid twentieth-century between Anglo Americans and the Hispanics, with less
than two percent of the population being African American. The citrus industry declined by
the late twentieth-century at which time agricultural production of cotton and other crops
as well as industrial manufacture took lead in the economy (Robinson III 2010).

Cultural Resources in Proximity to the Project Area
Background research for this project consisted of an online records search through the
THCâs Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas; 2017) and a review of historical maps and aerial
photographs. Research focused on the identification of archeological sites, sites listed as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), sites
listed on the NRHP, cemeteries, and previously conducted archeological surveys within
one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the APE (Figure 4). The search revealed that no previously

recorded archeological sites, SALs, RTHLs, sites listed on the NRHP, or cemeteries fall
within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the APE.
At least five previously conducted archeological surveys fall within one kilometer (0.62
mile) of the APE (Table 2). Of these, two overlap with the current project area. Surprisingly,
none of the archeological surveys resulted in the recording of any new archeological sites.

Prehistoric Land Use
A review of archeological sites near, but outside of the one kilometer (0.62 mile) buffer
revealed two prehistoric sites (41CF122 and 41CF130) located along the edges of resacas
to the southeast and east of the APE (Atlas 2017). Collectively, these sites consist of burned
clay, mussel and rhabdotus shell, a triangular dart point, and lithic debitage composed of
chert. Artifacts were observed on the surface with site size ranging from 10 to 40 meters
in diameter and underlain by a clayey soil texture. Both sites were recommended ineligible
for listing to the NRHP or as a SAL.

Historic Land Use
A 1923 Cameron County soils map (Figure 5) and a 1928 Cameron County, Texas 7.5-minute
topographic map (Figure 6) depict structures and/or buildings within or immediately
adjacent to the APE. However, by the mid-twentieth century most of the structures and/
or buildings were demolished (Figure 7). The closest historic site is located approximately
two kilometers (1.24 miles) southeast of the APE along FM 801 within the floodplain of
the Rio Grande. Recorded in 1983, 41CF123 is an early twentieth century farm residence
characterized by domestic debris scattered across the surface of a plowed field. Artifacts
include window glass, Clorox bottle glass, Coca Cola bottle fragments, milk glass, white
porcelain chinaware, and white stoneware. Site 41CF123 was recommended ineligible for
listing to the NRHP or as a SAL.

Methodology
Prior to field investigations, archeologists conducted archival research to assess the
potential for buried historic archeological materials. This research involved examining
historical maps, aerial photographs, and soil maps. As mentioned above, archeologists
consulted the Atlas to assess the potential for prehistoric archeological sites within the
APE. This not only allowed investigators to determine the presence of previously recorded
archeological sites within the APE, but also to gain a sense of site types, artifact types,
and average depth of cultural materials below the surface, among other things. The limits
of the APE were overlaid on topographic maps and loaded onto hand-held DeLorme GPS
units to aid in navigation.
Archeological fieldwork consisted of a thorough pedestrian survey supplemented by
strategically placed backhoe trenches. Investigators manually excavated five backhoe
trenches at approximately 200-meter intervals within the 120-foot wide proposed new
ROW. Per the request of the landowner(s), backhoe trenches measured no more than 3.5
meters (12 feet) in length and 30 centimeters (12 inches) in width. Additionally, backhoe
trenches were oriented with the existing field rows, roughly north to south. A sample of soil
from each backhoe trench was screened through Â¼â hardware cloth, and picked apart
on a screen. Archeologists trowel cleaned and profiled the walls of each trench before
backfilling them. All backhoe trenches were excavated to culturally sterile, pre-Holocene
soil or to the water table, whichever was encountered first.
While conducting the pedestrian survey, archeologists observed multiple areas of
disturbance. Areas of disturbances were photographed and the APEâs condition was noted
in detail. Archeologists attempted to avoid disturbances during backhoe trenching.
This archeological investigation was a non-collection survey; therefore, artifacts, were
returned to their original location.

Survey Results
The proposed US 77/83 South Parallel Corridor project is taking place within a steadily
growing urban community, San Benito, which is currently surrounded by agricultural fields.
The natural landscape within the APE gradually slopes from northeast to southwest with
elevations ranging from 36 to 43 feet AMSL. The APE does not cross any natural waterways
or resacas. Although, it does abut two buried pipelines depicted on the Cameron County
Irrigation District No. 2 map (Figure 8). Disturbances observed within the APE consisted of
those associated with agriculture (e.g., plowing) and channelization around the resacas.
During field investigations the temperature ranged from 65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit with
no precipitation.
All investigations took place in October of 2017 and included the excavation of five backhoe
trenches (Figure 9; Table 3), coupled with a thorough inspection of the APEâs surface.
Ground surface visibility was good across most of the APE. Soils encountered within the
APE were shallow (Depth: average 28.6 cmbs; min: 11 cmbs; max: 49 cmbs) and were
characterized by dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy clay underlain by brown (10YR 4/3)
clay containing calcium carbonate.

Parcel 1
Parcel 1 is a 1.28 acre tract located along a drainage easement north of Nixon Road
(Figure 10). The southeast edge of this parcel abuts Resaca de los Fresnos, which
has steep banks that extend approximately five meters below the surrounding terrain
(Figure 11). The uniformity of the drainage bank suggests that the Resaca has been
modified through channelization. By effect, itâs likely that some of the adjacent area is
disturbed. The area consists of dense scrub vegetation that includes mesquite, hackberry
and tall grasses (Figure 12). The bottom of the Resaca is occupied by cattails and other
wetland vegetation. Parcel 1 overlaps a natural tributary of the Resaca de los Fresnos that
appears as an earthen depression that was dry at the time of survey. A previous survey
(Dowling & Feit 2013) included the excavation of backhoe trenches at the northwest and
the southeast end of this parcel.
Archeological investigations focused on the slightly elevated portion of Parcel 1 that
occurs alongside the tributary, with the expectation that such a place would likely contain
archeological materials. Here one trench, BHT-5, was excavated (Figure 13; Table 4). This
trench was excavated with two parallel passes of the 12-inch bucket in order to widen the
trench to about 61 centimeters. The trench encountered shallow loamy clay overlaying
clay at around 11 cmbs. This trench was excavated partially though the clay before
terminating at 43 cmbs. No cultural materials or features were observed in the trench.
Surface inspection of the entire parcel was conducted after BHT-5 was backfilled. Ground
surface visibility was estimated at 60 to 75 percent and no cultural materials or features
were documented.

Parcel 2
Parcel 2 is a 7.27 acre tract located within a plowed cotton field parallel to Ramsey Road
south of San Benito (Figure 14). The northwest end of the parcel is located slightly
southeast of Resaca del Rancho Viejo. Surface inspection was conducted throughout
the entire APE and found ground surface visibility to be 100 percent due to the exposed
plowed soil and sparse vegetation that consisted of small cotton plant sprouts (Figure 15).
A total of four backhoe trenches were excavated throughout the parcel, characterized by
very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy clay over brown (10YR 4/3) clay at depths that
ranged from 26 to 49 cmbs. Calcium carbonate inclusions were observed with Level 2 of
the trenches. Trench excavations terminated between 36 and 78 cmbs (Figure 16; Table
5). A variety of chert gravels were observed on the ground surface and within Level 1.
Most of these gravels measure five to ten centimeters in diameter. An estimated twentyfive percent of the gravels observed exhibit fracture scars that are typical of plow damage.
After inspection, we concluded that these fractures did not resemble those associated
with prehistoric knapping activities.
One historic-age archeological site, 41CF233, was recorded within Parcel No. 2.

41CF233
Site 41CF233 an early-twentieth century domestic debris scatter located on a flood plain
adjacent to Resaca del Rancho Viejo (Figure 17). The site consists of early twentiethcentury domestic debris distributed across a plowed field and mixed with contemporary
debris. Ground surface visibility was 100 percent at the time of survey due to a lack of
vegetation across the exposed, plowed surface. Two backhoe trenches were excavated
within the site area, one of which recovered a single fragment of early-twentieth century
glass in the upper 49 cmbs.
Artifacts observed included a milk glass shard, whiteware ceramic sherds (n=2), a light
yellowish brown striped glazed ceramic sherd, and brown vessel glass shards (Figure 18)
mixed with fragments of string, plastic, foam, and bottle glass. The artifacts likely date to
around the early twentieth-century. A review of historic-age topographic maps (DOI 2017)
revealed a structure located near the southeast end of Parcel 2 as early as 1927 (see Figure
7), but was demolished by the mid-twentieth century. Surface inspection was conducted
and one backhoe trench was excavated in the vicinity of this location. No domestic or
structural materials were observed on or below ground surface. Additionally, two houses
are currently located on the opposite side of Ramsey Road, both of which do not appear to
be greater than fifty years in age.
According to the Handbook of Texas Online, the area where San Benito is located was part
of a Spanish land grant called ConcepciÃ³n de Carricitos. The land grant was awarded to
Bartolome and Eugenio Fernandez in 1789. Eugenio Fernandez was a soldier and explorer
who was involved in several expeditions across Padre Island in 1766, as well as subsequent
military campaigns along the Rio Grande (Johnson 2010). In 1904, the property was sold
to Judge Stephen Powers. Sometime prior to 1925 the property was then sold to a M. C.
Crispen. Following the death of M. C. Crispen in 1946, his estate was sold to J. C. Elliff. A
search of the above mentioned names in the Handbook of Texas Online did not produce
any results. The property is currently owned by W. T. Pitts who purchased the property

sometime in the early twenty first century. Thus, the site is not likely to be associated with
any historically significant persons.
Site 41CF233 is likely associated with a nearby early twentieth century farmstead. As
there is no evidence of any structural remains at this location, the debris is likely part
of a refuse dump. No features or diagnostic artifacts were recovered from the site, and
the site has little potential to contain additional materials that would provide valuable
information for future research. In fact, the historic period materials have no potential to
yield valuable information about regional history, events, or cultural patterns. Lastly, the
site is not associated with any person of regional significance. Therefore, 41CF233 is not
recommended for inclusion on the NRHP, or as a SAL.â
No further work is recommended for this portion of 41CF233.

Recommendations
AmaTerra conducted an intensive archeological survey of approximately 8.55 acres in
advance of a proposed new roadway in San Benito, Cameron County, Texas. The project
was conducted under Section 106 and the ACT, and work conformed to the guidelines
for implementation of these regulations under 36 CFR Part 800 and 13 TAC Chapter 26.
Access was available to 100 percent of the proposed APE.
Archeologists conducted a thorough pedestrian survey and excavated five backhoe
trenches in support of this project. As a result, investigators recorded one new historic-age
archeological site, 41CF233.
Site 41CF233 is characterized by an early twentieth century domestic debris scatter
situated on the surface of a plowed field. Artifacts consisted of whiteware ceramic sherds,
a milk glass shard, a yellowish-brown striped glazed ceramic sherd, and brown vessel
glass shards. The artifacts were found in association with contemporary debris and are
believed to be out of context. Based on the limited quantity and common occurrence of
the historic-age artifacts, a lack of features, diagnostic artifacts, and stratigraphic integrity,
disturbances, and no known association with historically significant individuals AmaTerra
recommends the site ineligible for listing on the NRHP, or as a SAL.
No additional work is recommended for the 8.55-acre APE.
Archeologists did not collect any artifacts during this survey; therefore, none will be curated
at TARL. This report is submitted in fulfillment of Antiquities Permit No. 8199.
