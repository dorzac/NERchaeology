ABSTRACT
Two intensive surveys carried out by the Texas Archeological
Survey, The University of Texas at Austin, for the Lower Colorado
River Authority, as an aide to planning the development of the
Cummins Creek Lignite Mine in Fayette County led to the identification
of 133 prehistoric and 63 historic sites. Seventy one prehistoric
and twenty three historic sites lie within the Twelve Year Permit
Areq. Seventeen of the 24 prehistoric sites recomnended for
further study were scheduled for limited testing in 1984 to determine
their relevance to regional models of adaptation and their
stratigraphic integrity as members contributing to a National
Register District determination of eligibility for the overall study
area. Ten of those were found to have suffered from post-depositional
di sturb.ances that 1 imited the tr research potentia 1 to that recovered
by suBsurface sampling. The six si"tes that individually met criteria
for National Register nomination, 41FY242/244 (now one extensive site),

Features
Feature 1 (TPS, level 2)

This scatter of burned rock is composed primarily of sandstone and to
a lesser degree, chert cobbles.

No discolored soil or pit outline was

found in association with the burned rock.

The grouping follows no

particular· outline; appearing as an outlying scatter in the northwestern
portion of the unit.

The entire burned scatter measures 75 by'75 centi-

meters at approximately 40 centimeters below surface.

The

Artifacts
The majority of the recovered artifacts are lithic debitage; 726

Sixty eight percent of all

flakes and chips are chert, the remaining 32% are petrified wood,

Definite discoloration and charcoal flecks were noted in

Zone 3 - Compact light gray loamy sand with minor discoloration from
Zone 2 in the upper portions. Thickness varies slightly
from pit to pit;
60 to 90 centimeters.
Active rodent
burrowing is still noticeable. Cultural material was fairly
constant throughout, but with less frequency than zones 1

Pottery sherds recovered from the upper portion of

Excavation ceased
in TP4 midway through this zone.
Zone 4 - Compact light gray loamy sand, with reddish brown hues noted
in TPl.
Thicknesses ranged from 90 and 110 centimeters.
Gopher activity is not as prevalent and minimal cultural
material was noted. In TP2 and TP3, this is the bottom of
the unit.
Zone 5 - Compact mottled brown and gray loamy sand with variable
depth; 110 to 120 centimeters. No burrowing activity noted
in this zone and cultural material decreases. Excavation of
TPl and TP5 ceased at this zone.
Zone 6 - Very compacted brown loamy sand. This unexcavated zone lies
at the bottom of TP5.
Excavation ceased at this level
because of impenetrability and a substantial reduction in
the amount of cultural material in the preceding level (see
table).

Site Stratigraphy

Soils at the site are Burlewash fine sandy loams (SCS

These predominantly upland soils are formed in materials

weathered from the underlying tuffaceous sandstones, in this
case the Manning Formation.

Zone 1 - Uncompacted grayish brown loamy sands. This included a 0-5
centimeter thick humic zone in most pits and trenches.
Ground covering varied from cedar duff and post oak leaf
litter to grasses.
Small roots and organics were noted in
the humic layer. In the southeast portion (Area A) this zone
measures from 0 to 80 centimeters below surface. In the
shallow areas, test pits 3 and 4 and backhoe trenches 1
through 4, it measures 0 - 40 centimeters. Debitage is found
throughout the zone. Features 1, 2 and 4 were found in this
zone also.
Temporally diagnostic artifacts indicate Late
Archaic occupations, while surface collected diagnostics
indicated Early and Middle Archaic use.
Zone 2 Slightly compact, brownish-gray fine loamy sand that varies in
thickness from a maximum of 80 - 140 centimeters in BHT 5 to
a minimum of 20 - 40 centimeters in BHT 2. Disturbances from
gopher burrowing are visible in the matrix of this zone.
Cultural material, mostly debris from lithic reduction, was
encountered throughout the zone. Features 3 and 5 were found
artifacts
in this zone as were temporally diagnostic
indicative of Late Archaic occupations.
Zone 3 - This light compacted gray loamy fine sand zone has a maximum
thickness of 60 - 80 centimeters in TPl. Debitage and burned
rock were found throughout the zone.
Zone 4 - Light gray sands with reddish and brown mottles and
clayey inclusions measuring from 80 - 105 centimeters in
depth. Debitage and burned rock are prevalent.
Zone 5 - Sandstone bedrock in TPl and BHT 6; clay in backhoe trenches
1, Z, 3 and 4, and TP4. Excavations ceased at this zone.

Site Stratigraphy

Soils at the site are loamy fine sands of. the Fa·lba variant series
(SCS 1981). These soils were formed in tuffaceous·sandstone on the
uplands. The d~pth of the sandy A horizon sotls varied from 31 centimeters in TP2 to 76 centimeters ih TP4. The underlying B horizon
clays bespeak the heavy erosion tha~ has.taken place at the site.
Moderately to sharply undulating and sloping clays were found to
contain feature material in their gullies.· The variable sandy deposition is further proof· of the o_ngoing sheetwash e'rosion that
continues .to redeposit cultural material and soils. Slumpinb cutbanks
are further examples of t~e undercutting from tributary waters. Gravel
deposits with chert and quartzi"te were note.d in the banks. Combined,
these have elefini"tely affected the deposition of cultural material ·at
thi.s small prehistoric campsi"te. What follows is a site stratigraphy
bas·ed on test pit profiles and shovel probes.
·
Zone 1 - 0 to 5 c~ntimete~s of light colored.loamy fine sandy humus

this zone.
Zone 2 - 5 to 35 centimeters .. A sltghtly compacted gr.ayish loamy fine

Stratigraphy

Soils:at the site are· Burlewash fine sandy loams (SCS 1978).
These a~e upland soils formed in materials weath~red from tuffaceous
sandstone or siltstone (SCS 1978). These sandy soils are easily
altered by the erosional processes which colluvially redeposit soils
downslope. Point bar flooding is readily discernible along the lower
southeastern and southern·edges of the site. The opposite cutbank has
been scoured to ~ height of approximately five ~eters.
Major disturbances to the site area are from gopher burrowing,
erosion and plowing. Thease are apparent in the profile, where gopher
burrowing is rampant. This and plowing would account for horizontal,
and to some degree vertical, movement of cultural material. Movement
by natural process can be obs-erved in the scattered array of most
features.
Zone 1 - O to 5 centimeters of humus with

~oots

and cultural material.

Zone 2 - 5 to 30 centimeters- of brown sandy loam with roots and pea
gravels. Cultural material is found throughout the matrix. No
temporally diagnostic artffacts indicate period of occupation.

Site Stratigraphy

Soils at the site are Tremona series very gravelly loamy fine
sands (SGS 1979), upland soils formed in interbedded clayey and
loamy materials. A horizon loamy.sands varied in depth across the
divide. Soils in the central area ·were significantly deeper than
those in surrounding areas. Substantial erosion of the underlying
clays has formed the base for eroding sands, The boundaries within
the A horizon were indistinct, approximations were used for some
profiles. The following profile is a composite of soils from across
the site and also exhibits the erosional nature of the clay zone,
Zone 1 - a to 70 centimeters of light brown uncompacted to slightly
compacted loamy fine sands. This zone appears heavily .disturbed by rodent burrowing. Minimal densities of debitage,
tools and cores were observed throughout the zone. Feature 2
in TP3 was in the lower portions of this zone. Dart points
which conform to no standard type sign.ify Archaic occupations
at various levels, A thermoluminescence sample from Fe~ture 1,
TP2, level 2, was of such poor quality that the resultant date
was not reliable (Alpha Analytics Inc. 1985).
Zone 2 - 70 to 150 centimeters of light grayish tan, compacted and
coarse loamy sands. Small gravels increase with depth, Debitage
is still found throughout but dwindles with depth, Dart points
of undefined type suggest Archaic occupations.
Zone 3 - Unexcavated, compacted and coarse tannish gray sandy clay.
