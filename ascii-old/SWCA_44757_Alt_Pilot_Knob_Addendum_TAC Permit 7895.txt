Addendum Report: Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed Alternate Pilot Knob Wastewater Interceptor
Phase 2B Project, City of Austin, Travis County, Texas

ABSTRACT
In January 2017, at the request of Brookfield Residential, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for the proposed Alternate Pilot Knob Wastewater
Interceptor Phase 2B Project along Cottonmouth Creek in southeast Austin, Travis County, Texas. The
project involves the construction of an approximately 3,077-foot-long (937.9-meter [m]) wastewater
interceptor within an 80-foot-wide (24.4-m) easement, as well as immediately adjacent work areas
encompassing 10.7 acres (4.3 hectares [ha]). Subsequent to SWCA’s survey, the project area was revised
and an entirely new area encompassing 10.4 acres (4.2 ha) was added just south-southwest of the original
area. In August 2017, SWCA returned and surveyed the additional area not investigated during the
January 2017 investigations. As the project is on lands that will ultimately be owned by a municipal
utility district, a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the project is subject to review under the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). SWCA conducted all the investigations under Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 7895 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon Young, M.A.
The original January 2017 project area involves the construction of an approximately 3,077-foot-long
(937.9-m) wastewater interceptor within an 80-foot-wide (24.4-m) easement, as well as immediately
adjacent work areas. The total size of the proposed January 2017 original survey area and interceptor
alignment is 10.7 acres (4.3 ha). The additional August 2017 project area represents a proposed
realignment of the portion of the alignment surveyed in January 2017. The total size of the proposed
August 2017 additional survey area and interceptor alignment is 10.4 acres (4.2 ha). Therefore, the
cumulative area of potential effects (APE) for the proposed project is 21.1 acres (8.5 ha). The depth of
impacts is anticipated to extend up to 10 feet (3.0 m) below ground surface.
The initial background review revealed that eight cultural resources surveys have been conducted near the
proposed project area; those various investigations, as well as others, resulted in the recording of 13
archaeological sites within a 1-mile (1.6-kilometer [km]) radius of the APE. In addition, two cemeteries
are located within a 1-mile (1.6-km) radius of the project area, of which one (the Collins Cemetery) is
situated along the northwest margin of the original January 2017 project area. The review of the Texas
Department of Transportation Historic Overlay maps revealed two potentially historic-age structures and
one cemetery within or immediately adjacent to the APE. The previously submitted and concurred upon
final cultural resources survey report for the January 2017 survey area recommended avoidance and no
encroachment along the northwestern margin of the APE just west of Cottonmouth School Road, due to
the close proximity of the Collins Cemetery.
In August 2017, SWCA archaeologists revisited the project area and conducted cultural resources
investigations within the entirely new unsurveyed additional 10.4 acres (4.2 ha). Field investigations
involved extensive visual examination and pedestrian survey with the excavation of 27 shovel tests. Field
investigations revealed the undeveloped riparian zone on the gently sloping floodplain and rolling
gravelly ridges along Cottonwood Creek within the uplands Blackland Prairie environment. All of the
shovel tests (STs) were negative for cultural materials with the exception of one, ST JFA05, which
contained one prehistoric secondary flake designated as isolated find (IF) 02. Visual examination of the
APE encountered two potentially historic whiteware fragments designated as IF03 along the ground
surface in the vicinity of ST JFA13. IF01 was discovered during the January 2017 investigations and is
further discussed in that report (Cody 2017). Isolated finds are not eligible for designation as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) and do not warrant further investigation in Texas.
In accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith
effort to identify cultural resources within the APE. As no archaeological historic properties or sites were
identified that meet the criteria for listing on the NRHP or warrant designation as an SAL, per 13 ACT
26.10, SWCA recommends a determination of No Historic Properties Affected for the complete
undertaking and that no further cultural resources investigations are warranted within the APE.

Phase 2B Project, City of Austin, Travis County, Texas

INTRODUCTION
In January 2017, at the request of Brookfield Residential, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for the proposed Alternate Pilot Knob Wastewater
Interceptor Phase 2B Project along Cottonmouth Creek in southeast Austin, Travis County, Texas
(Figure 1). The project involves the construction of an approximately 3,077-foot-long (937.9-meter [m])
wastewater interceptor within an 80-foot-wide (24.4 m) easement, as well as immediately adjacent work
areas encompassing 10.7 acres (4.3 hectare [ha]). Subsequent to SWCA’s survey, the project area was
revised and an entirely new area encompassing 10.4 acres (4.2 ha) was added just south-southwest of the
original area. In August 2017, SWCA returned and surveyed the additional area not investigated during
the January 2017 investigations (see Figure 1). As the project is on lands that will ultimately be owned by
a municipal utility district (MUD), a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the project is subject to
review under the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) and archaeological field investigations required a
Texas Antiquities Permit (TAP) issued by the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
This addendum report details the findings of the August 2017 additional survey for the entirely new area
not included in the January 2017 survey. Information regarding the natural setting and cultural history of
the project region, methods utilized during these investigations, and results of background reviews and
previous survey investigations are outlined in the previously submitted and concurred upon final cultural
resources survey report (Cody 2017).
The purpose of this investigation was to identify and assess any cultural resources, such as historic and
prehistoric archaeological sites and historic buildings, structures, objects, and sites (such as cemeteries)
that might be located within the boundaries of the proposed undertaking, and evaluate the significance
and eligibility of these cultural resources for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).
Investigations consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing of the proposed project area.
All investigations were conducted in accordance with the ACT and standards and guidelines established
by the THC and Council of Texas Archeologists, as well as the guidelines provided in Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (National Park Service 1983).

PROJECT PERSONNEL
Brandon Young, M.A., RPA, served as Principal Investigator and Task Lead for the duration of the
project, overseeing overall logistics and organization, managing reporting, and agency consultation. The
additional survey was completed by Archaeologists Mercedes C. Cody, B.A. and Jesus Alcantar, B.A. on
August 2–3, 2017, under TAP No. 7895. Mercedes C. Cody prepared the report of investigations. Carole
Carpenter produced all field and report maps and Lauri Logan provided technical editing and document
preparation.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The project area appears on portions of the Montopolis, Texas, (3097-213) U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map (see Figure 1). It is located along and southwest of
Cottonmouth School Road off of Dee Gabriel Collins Road approximately 0.75 mile northwest of U.S.
Highway 183 within a semi-rural setting surrounded by rolling, open pastures combined with scattered
and expanding residential and commercial development. The APE is intersected by Cottonmouth Creek, a
northward-flowing drainage that empties into Onion Creek roughly 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometer [km])
downstream from the project area. The vegetation within the APE consists of various hardwoods
particularly along the riparian zone of Cottonmouth Creek and agricultural fields along the uplands
encompassing the creek. Previous impacts to the project area include erosion, vegetation clearing,
agricultural and residential activity, two-track roads, fence lines, push piles, and utility installations (both
overhead and subsurface).
The original January 2017 project area involves the construction of an approximately 3,077-foot-long
(937.9-m) wastewater interceptor within an 80-foot-wide (24.4 m) easement, as well as immediately
adjacent work areas. The total size of the proposed January 2017 original survey area and interceptor
alignment is 10.7 acres (4.3 ha). The additional August 2017 project area represents a proposed
realignment of the portion of the alignment surveyed in January 2017. The total size of the proposed
August 2017 additional survey area and interceptor alignment is 10.4 acres (4.2 ha). Therefore, the
cumulative area of potential effects (APE) for the proposed project is 21.1 acres (8.5 ha; see Figure 1).
The depth of impacts is anticipated to extend up to 10 feet (3 m) below ground surface. No impacts to the
channel of Cottonmouth Creek are proposed as the planned interceptor will be bored beneath the creek.

FIELD SURVEY RESULTS
In August 2017, SWCA archaeologists revisited the project area and conducted an intensive pedestrian
survey augmented with shovel testing within the entirely new area encompassing 10.4 acres (4.2 ha) not
investigated during the January 2017 survey (Figure 2). The previously investigated January 2017 survey
area encompasses 10.7 acres (4.3 ha) situated just north-northeast of the current August 2017 survey area.
Visual examination of the project area revealed the undeveloped riparian zone on the gently sloping
floodplain and rolling gravelly ridges along Cottonwood Creek within the uplands Blackland Prairie
environment (Figures 3–5). Vegetation consists of scattered oaks and various hardwoods with shrubs and
short to tall grasses. Ground surface visibility was low throughout the survey area ranging between 0 to
50 percent, and averaged approximately 25 percent. Clays and moderate to dense surface cobbles and
gravels were present at ground surface. Disturbances observed in the area include erosion, vegetation
clearing, two-track roads, fence lines, and pushpiles. No cultural materials were observed during surface
investigations, with the exception of an historic isolated find (IF) observed in the northeastern portion of
the APE immediately adjacent to a shovel test. The find is further discussed in the IF section below. IF01
was discovered during the January 2017 investigations and is further discussed in that report (Cody
2017).
Cottonwood Creek exhibits one main channel with rounded banks and several shallower channels
winding through the floodplain, suggestive of a braided channel network (Knighton 1998). These
channels merge as water flows downstream to create a single channel that is approximately 3 feet (0.9 m)
deep and 8 feet (2.4 m) wide. This fluvial arrangement is typically associated with frequent lateral
accretion and erosion (Knighton 1998). Accordingly, the lateral movement of the drainage may affect the
integrity of any cultural deposits (if present) that may be buried.

SWCA excavated a total of 27 shovel tests (MCC01–13 and JFA01–14) within the additional August
2017 APE (see Figure 2; Table 1). Shovel tests were excavated to depths ranging from 0–30 cm (0–
18.81 inches) below ground surface. The shovel tests encountered thick, very dark gray clay containing
natural chert cobbles and gravels, and terminated due to compact, thick soils (see Table 1). All shovel
tests were negative for cultural materials, with the exception of one shovel test along the southwestern
margin of the APE that contained a prehistoric IF. The find is further discussed in the IF section below.

ISOLATED FINDS (IFS)
Two isolated finds (IF02 and IF03) were identified within the APE during the current survey
investigations. IF02 consists of a prehistoric secondary reduction debitage chert flake discovered within
shovel test (ST) JFA05 between 0 and 15 centimeters (cm) below ground surface (see Figure 2; Figure 6).
Six shovel tests (JFA10–12 and MCC09–11) were excavated at roughly 25-m intervals around the IF, all
of which were negative for cultural materials (see Table 1). IF03 consists of two potentially historic
whiteware fragments situated along the ground surface immediately adjacent to ST JFA13 (see Figure 2;
Figure 7). Shovel tests excavated near the find (JFA09, MCC08, and MCC13) were negative for cultural
materials (see Table 1). IF01 was discovered during the January 2017 investigations and is further
discussed in that report (Cody 2017). Isolated finds are not eligible as for designation as SALs and do not
warrant further investigations in Texas.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In January 2017 at the request of Brookfield Residential, SWCA conducted an intensive cultural
resources survey for the proposed Alternate Pilot Knob Wastewater Interceptor Phase 2B Project along
Cottonmouth Creek in southeast Austin, Travis County, Texas. The project involves the construction of
an approximately 3,077-foot-long (937.9 m) wastewater interceptor within an 80-foot-wide (24.4 m)
easement, as well as immediately adjacent work areas encompassing 10.7 acres (4.3 ha). Subsequent to
SWCA’s survey, the project area was revised and an entirely new area encompassing 10.4 acres (4.2 ha)
was added just south-southwest of the original area. In August 2017, SWCA returned and surveyed the
additional area not investigated during the January 2017 investigations. As the project is on lands that will
ultimately be owned by a MUD, a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the project is subject to
review under the ACT and SWCA conducted all the investigations under TAP No. 7895.
The initial background review revealed that eight cultural resources surveys have been conducted near the
proposed project area; those various investigations, as well as others, resulted in the recording of 13
archaeological sites within a 1-mile (1.6-km) radius of the APE. In addition, two cemeteries are located
within a 1-mile (1.6-km) radius of the project area, of which one (the Collins Cemetery) is situated along
the northwest margin of the original January 2017 project area. The review of the Texas Department of
Transportation Historic Overlay maps revealed two potentially historic-age structures and one cemetery
within or immediately adjacent to the APE. The previously submitted and concurred upon final cultural
resources survey report for the January 2017 survey area recommended avoidance and no encroachment
along the northwestern margin of the APE just west Cottonmouth School Road, due to the close
proximity of the Collins Cemetery (Cody 2017).

In August 2017, SWCA archaeologists revisited the project area and conducted cultural resources
investigations within the new additional survey area encompassing 10.4 acres (1.7 ha). Field
investigations involved extensive visual examination and pedestrian survey with the excavation of 27
shovel tests. Field investigations revealed the undeveloped riparian zone on the gently sloping floodplain
and rolling gravelly ridges along Cottonwood Creek within the uplands Blackland Prairie environment.
All of the shovel tests were negative for cultural materials with the exception of one, ST JFA05, which
contained one prehistoric secondary flake designated as IF02. Visual examination of the APE encountered
two potentially historic whiteware fragments designated as IF03 along the ground surface in the vicinity
of ST JFA13. IF01 was discovered during the January 2017 investigations and is further discussed in that
report (Cody 2017). Isolated finds are not eligible for designation as SALs or for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and do not warrant further investigation in Texas.
In accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith
effort to identify cultural resources within the APE. As no archaeological historic properties or sites were
identified that meet the criteria for listing on the NRHP or warranting designation as an SAL, per 13 ACT
26.10, SWCA recommends a determination of No Historic Properties Affected for the complete
undertaking and that no further cultural resources investigations are warranted within the APE.
