MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On September 5, 2014, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey for a proposed 91.5-meter- (300.0-foot-) long access road
within the Whitestone Condominiums tract in Cedar Park, Williamson County, Texas (Project
Area). The proposed project would entail constructing 91.5 meters (300.0 feet) of new access
road across a portion of a known prehistoric archeological site, 41WM235 (also known as the
Wilson-Leonard site), that has been formally designated as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).
The Project Area measures 91.5 meters (300.0 feet) in length by 15.2 meters (50.0 feet) in
width, covering a total area of 0.1 hectares (0.3 acres). The proposed development is located
approximately 0.5 kilometers (0.3 miles) east of the intersection of Farm-to-Market Road (FM)
1431 and Parmer Lane (FM 734). At the time of the survey, the tract was owned and operated
by the William Wilson, Jr., Trust; at the time of archeological construction monitoring, the tract
was owned by Milestone Parmer Development, LLC (Milestone).
The proposed access road is located on private property, and the project is being
sponsored by Milestone, a private developer. However, the proposed undertaking would be
located on a historic property that has been designated as an SAL—site 41WM235, more
commonly known as the Wilson-Leonard site. Since the property on which this portion of site
41WM235 is located is an SAL, any proposed development within the property boundaries falls
under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). As the project’s development has
the potential to impact potentially significant cultural resources, Milestone was required to
provide a cultural resources evaluation to assess the potential of the proposed undertaking to
impact site 41WM235 in compliance with the ACT. The cultural resources survey was
performed under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit No. 7013. Jennifer L. Cochran
served as the Principal Investigator for the archeological survey and during negotiation of the
subsequent archeological construction monitoring plan. TAC Permit No. 7013 was officially
transferred by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) to Jeffrey D. Owens in July 2015, and
Mr. Owens served as the Principal Investigator during the archeological monitoring.
The archeological survey of the Project Area resulted in the reassessment of a portion of
site 41WM235. The Wilson-Leonard site, 41WM235, is an extensive prehistoric campsite
adjacent to (west of) Brushy Creek. Eight shovel tests excavated within the Project Area
revealed high densities of cultural materials in subsurface contexts up to 1.0 meters (3.3 feet)
below ground surface. Additionally, a large burned rock midden was observed within the

Management Summary

northwestern portion of the Project Area, and cultural materials associated with this feature were
observed in subsurface contexts down to 80.0 to 100.0 centimeters (31.5 to 39.4 inches) below
ground surface. High densities of burned rocks, faunal bone, and lithic debitage were observed
within this feature. The presence of a possible Marshall point fragment tentatively dates the
feature to the Middle Archaic period.
The portion of site 41WM235 that falls within the Project Area has been formally
designated as an SAL. Based upon a temporally diagnostic projectile point fragment, the
presence of an intact cultural feature, the presence of preserved faunal remains, and the
presence of buried, stratified archeological deposits, it was Horizon’s opinion that the portion of
site 41WM235 located within the Project Area is a contributing element to the site’s overall SAL
designation. Horizon recommended avoidance and protection of site 41WM235 during
construction and development within the Project Area.
With the assistance of Horizon, Milestone consulted with the THC regarding
recommendations for proper avoidance and protection strategies regarding the portion of site
41WM235 that falls within the Project Area. Horizon recommended that Milestone bury the
portion of site 41WM235 within the Project Area. In accordance with this recommendation, the
THC suggested that 0.9 to 1.5 meters (3.0 to 5.0 feet) of artificial fill be placed over the portion
of site 41WM235 that falls within the Project Area in order to cap and protect the cultural
deposits observed here. Additionally, the THC required that all drainage culverts, electrical and
utility installations, irrigation systems, landscaping designs, and road signage within the Project
Area be installed no deeper than the base of the artificial fill to be placed over site 41WM235.
Horizon assisted Milestone in the development of an archeological monitoring plan, which was
approved by the THC in September 2014. The monitoring plan stipulated that an archeological
monitor would be present on-site daily during all construction activities, including fill deposition
and subsequent grading related to placing protective fill on the burned rock midden on site
41WM235 within the Project Area. Milestone agreed to place at least 0.9 meters (3.0 feet) of
artificial fill over the portion of site 41WM235 within the Project Area in order to avoid any
adverse effects to archeological deposits and also committed to the presence of the on-site
archeological monitor.
The initial development plans showed that no utility or wastewater lines were to be
installed within the Project Area; however, 2 storm water culverts were to be installed near the
northern and central portions of the Project Area. Milestone indicated that the construction of
both drainage culverts would occur entirely within the artificial fill to be placed over site
41WM235. Milestone also indicated that the placement of any road signage, irrigation systems,
and landscaping efforts also would be entirely constructed within the required fill materials to be
placed over site 41WM235.
Pursuant to the implementation of the approved monitoring plan, the THC granted
permission for the capping and filling operations on the portion of site 41WM235 within the
Project Area.
Horizon was notified on September 23, 2015, that the deposition of artificial fill within the
Project Area had begun, and Horizon mobilized to the field that same day. Upon arriving,

Horizon’s archeological monitor observed that the initial layers of artificial fill had already been
deposited within the Project Area; as such, it was not possible to observe the initial stages of
ground preparation and fill deposition. The archeological monitor performed a thorough
inspection of the private property located adjacent to the edges of the Project Area and
observed that no natural sediments containing archeological deposits appeared to have been
displaced. Subsequently, Milestone provided photographs taken by the construction inspector
on the day on which the Project Area was initially prepared for deposition of artificial fill. Based
on these photographs, it appears that only minimal vegetation-clearing activities were
undertaken prior to fill deposition and that no archeological deposits were disturbed.
Horizon conducted archeological monitoring on several subsequent dates in connection
with the installation of various utilities within the artificial fill section, including installation of
storm sewers on December 1, 2015; the installation of water irrigation lines on December 11,
2015; the installation of electrical utility lines on January 11, 2016; and drilling associated with
construction of a new Pedernales Electric Cooperative (PEC) power pole on January 29, 2016.
While the power pole drilling was technically outside the scope of the current project as it was
constructed within PEC’s existing easement within the FM 1431 right-of-way (ROW) and
therefore outside of the Project Area, Horizon’s presence was nevertheless requested as a
good-faith effort to ensure that no significant archeological deposits were disturbed. No
archeological deposits were observed within the spoil excavated from the power pole footprint.
Horizon monitors were present on-site during all construction activities conducted within the
Project Area subsequent to the initial devegetation and fill deposition activities. All of the
construction activities within the Project Area were conducted entirely within the artificial fill
embankment. No natural sediments underlying the artificial fill containing archeological deposits
were disturbed during construction of the access road. The filling and capping activities
represented an effective method of avoiding impacts to the archeological deposits within the
Project Area, and there were no adverse effects to site 41WM235 within the Project Area.
At this time, proposed construction within the Project Area has been completed and no
further archeological investigations are warranted in connection with the proposed undertaking.
However, in the event that construction plans should change or that future subsurface
disturbances to the portion of site 41WM235 located within the Project Area cannot be avoided
for any reason, Horizon recommends that Milestone consult with the THC before commencing
any ground-disturbing activities. Additionally, in the event that any additional cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the Project Area, even in previously surveyed
areas, all work within 7.6 meters (25.0 feet) of the location of the inadvertent discovery should
cease immediately and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was contracted by Milestone Parmer
Development, LLC (Milestone) to conduct an intensive cultural resources survey for a proposed
91.5-meter- (300.0-foot-) long access road within the Whitestone Condominiums tract in Cedar
Park, Williamson County, Texas (Project Area). The proposed project would entail constructing
91.5 meters (300.0 feet) of new access road across a portion of a known prehistoric
archeological site, 41WM235 (also known as the Wilson-Leonard site), that has been formally
designated as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). The Project Area measures 91.5 meters
(300.0 feet) in length by 15.2 meters (50.0 feet) in width, covering a total area of 0.1 hectares
(0.3 acres) (Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The proposed development is located approximately 0.5
kilometers (0.3 miles) east of the intersection of Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 1431 and Parmer
Lane (FM 734). At the time of the survey, the tract was owned and operated by the William
Wilson, Jr., Trust; at the time of archeological construction monitoring, the tract was owned by
Milestone Parmer Development, LLC (Milestone).
The proposed access road is located on private property, and the project is being
sponsored by Milestone, a private developer. However, the proposed undertaking is located
within the boundaries of a historic property that has been designated as an SAL—site
41WM235, more commonly known as the Wilson-Leonard site. Since the property on which this
portion of site 41WM235 is located has a formal designation as an SAL, any proposed
development within the property boundaries falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). As the project’s development has the potential to impact potentially significant
cultural resources, Milestone was required to provide a cultural resources evaluation to assess
the potential of the proposed undertaking to impact site 41WM235 in compliance with the ACT.
The cultural resources survey was performed under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit
No. 7013. Jennifer L. Cochran served as the Principal Investigator for the initial archeological
survey and during negotiation of the subsequent archeological construction monitoring plan.
TAC Permit No. 7013 was officially transferred by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) to
Jeffrey D. Owens in July 2015, following Ms. Cochran’s departure from Horizon, and Mr. Owens
served as the Principal Investigator during the archeological monitoring.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, a program of archeological construction
monitoring, and the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation

2.1

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The cultural resources survey reported herein assessed approximately 91.5 meters
(300.0 feet) of proposed access road within the proposed Whitestone Condominiums tract in
south-central Williamson County, Texas. The proposed development is located approximately
0.5 kilometers (0.3 miles) east of the intersection of FM 1431 and Parmer Lane (FM 734) in
Cedar Park, Texas, and can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Leander, Texas, topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1-1). Vegetation within the Project Area
consisted of cacti, bull nettle, short- to medium-height grasses, and groves of Ashe juniper and
oak trees. Photographs of the Project Area are provided in Figures 2-1 and 2-2.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in south-central Williamson County, Texas. Williamson
County is situated near the southern end of the Lampasas Cut Plain (Hill 1901; Hill and Vaughn
1900; Johnson 1931:125) in Central Texas and close to the common junction of 3 significant
physiographic provinces—the Lampasas Cut Plain, the Edwards Plateau, and the Blackland
Prairie. The Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone situated between the Edwards
Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east, is a low, rolling land that extends in a
narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones Fault Zone from the Red River Valley in
northeastern Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low
topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and streams
flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are associated
with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between uplands
composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In
places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by
a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms
of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life.
The Lampasas Cut Plain is a roughly triangular area of rolling hill country in central and
north-central Texas situated between the Brazos and Colorado rivers ranging in elevation from
229.9 to 400.0 meters (754.0 to 1,312.0 feet) above mean sea level (amsl). The Lampasas Cut
Plain forms a limestone upland that has been dissected by the Brazos River and its

tributaries, resulting in landforms characterized by generally rounded uplands cut by moderately
broad, shallow valleys. Soil is thin to absent on the bedrock and supports a mixed savanna
flora, whereas soil is moderately deep in valley floors, where it supports mixed riparian
woodlands and forests. Karst features include sinks, caves, and rockshelters, but such are
neither common nor extensive. Edwards chert is locally abundant but not widespread across
the Lampasas Cut Plain and is of high quality in some places.
Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Brazos River basin. The Project
Area is located approximately 103.7 meters (340.0 feet) to the southwest of Brushy Creek.
Brushy Creek flows generally east to northeastward to its confluence with the Little River in
Milam County, which in turn flows a short distance eastward and empties into the Brazos River.
The Brazos River flows southeastward across the Blackland Prairie and Gulf Coastal Plain,
ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short distance northeast of East Matagorda Bay.

2.3

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geomorphologically, the Project Area is situated on the Comanche Peak Formation (Kc),
which is composed of fine-grained fossiliferous, medium-hard, nodular limestone up to
25.9 meters (85.0 feet) in thickness. It also contains thin beds of dark gray shale and fossils
(Barnes 1974; Collins 1995). One defined soil type, Oakalla silty clay loam, 0 to 2%, frequently
flooded (Of), is mapped within the boundaries of the Project Area. This soil type is described in
Table 2-1 (NRCS 2014), and its distribution is mapped in Figure 2-3. The soils of the Oakalla
series consist of deep, well drained loamy sediments located on major stream terraces. The
Oakalla soil unit usually has the potential to contain intact subsurface archeological resources.
Aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered in upland settings and within
deep alluvial sediments adjacent to drainages in Central Texas. Based upon the location of the
Project Area on an alluvial terrace of Brushy Creek, the potential exists for buried cultural
resources within the Project Area. Intact, buried archeological deposits may occur within alluvial
sediments like those present within the Project Area. Historic-age resources may be found in
virtually any physiographic environment.

2.4

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).

During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have
been more stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post
oak savannas. The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued
into the mid-Holocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more
mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and
Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were
probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Williamson County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern
climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate
is influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified
by polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer,
and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature manifest regional
clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and mean
annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and Bomar
1983:18, 50). Climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical subhumid in western
Williamson County. Average annual precipitation totals 81.0 centimeters (32.0 inches) and
temperature averages 19.0 degrees Celsius (°C) (67.0 degrees Fahrenheit [°F]) annually,
ranging from 36.0°C (96.0°F) in August (the warmest month) to 15.0°C (59.0°F) in January (the
coldest month). During this time, however, drier periods lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total
annual rainfall ranged from 30.0 to 64.0 centimeters (12.0 to 25.0 inches) were followed by
abnormally wet years with 114.0 to 127.0 centimeters (45.0 to 50.0 inches) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall
(Baker 1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91.0 centimeters (36.0 inches) of rain
that fell within an 18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the
56.0-centimeter (22.0-inch) deluge that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May
1935 (Baker 1975). Lower rainfall amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In
winter, frontal storms pass so frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and
prevailing upper-level winds from west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning
that much of the available moisture is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of

Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the region and rainfall occurs primarily as
localized, thermal convective storms.

2.5

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950),
an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the
grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the
limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary, characterized as
“approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes through western
Williamson County in the vicinity of the Project Area.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird.
Reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat
snake, eastern hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake,
copperhead, western diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog,
diamondback water snake, Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and
antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are
no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project Area is located within the Central Texas archeological region. The
indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of North
America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through
time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (9200 TO 6000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now confidently be extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (9200 to 6000 B.C.) (Black 1989). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region of the hunting of extinct megafauna,
as has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence
pattern appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central
Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in
projectile point styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian Period, which is recognized based
on large, fluted projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and

HJN 140149 AR

11

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

the Late PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e.,
Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (6000 B.C. TO A.D. 800)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic stage
(6000 B.C. to A.D. 800). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation
of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less pronounced in
Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the
big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base
composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this hunting and
gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more diversified
tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general decrease in
the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows greater
diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
In Central Texas, the Early Archaic subperiod extends from 6000 to 3000 B.C., the Middle
Archaic subperiod extends from 3000 to 1000 B.C., and the Late Archaic subperiod covers the
1000 B.C. to A.D. 800 timeframe. Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as
markers differentiating these 3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as
well. Perhaps most markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic
subperiod, continuing into the Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the
Late Archaic subperiod. In addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is
often considered to constitute evidence of population growth, though differential preservation
probably at least partially accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 800 TO 1600)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800 to 1600) (Black 1989) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north who
lacked the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1600 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de

12

Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernible at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as increased
participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that
heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian
population was greatly diminished.
The earliest known historical occupants of Williamson County were the Tonkawa
Indians.1 The Tonkawa traditionally followed buffalo herds on foot and periodically set fire to the
prairie to aid them in their hunts. During the 18th century, however, they made the transition to
a horse-based culture and used firearms to a limited extent. Decimated by European diseases
and by warfare with the Cherokee and Comanche, the Tonkawa were generally friendly toward
the early settlers of Williamson County, but were nevertheless removed from Central Texas by
the 1850s. Lipan Apaches and Comanches were also associated with the area that would
become Williamson County. Before the arrival of Europeans in the area, the Lipan Apaches
ranged through the western part of present-day Williamson County, and, after Spanish missions
were established on the San Gabriel River in the 18th century, the Indians frequently raided the
missions for horses. Their enemies, the Comanches, arrived in the area in the 18th century and
lived in parts of the territory of Williamson County until as late as 1838. After they were crowded
out by Anglo settlers, the Comanches continued to raid settlements in the county until the
1860s. There also appear to have been small numbers of Kiowa, Yojuane, Tawakoni, and
Mayeye Indians living in the county at the time of the earliest Anglo settlements.
While Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca may have traveled through the area in the 16th
century, it was probably first explored by Europeans in the late 17th century, when Capt. Alonso
De León sought a route between San Antonio and the Spanish missions in East Texas that
would serve as a drier alternative to the more southerly Camino Real. The new route passed
through the area of Williamson County along Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River and was
called Camino de Arriba. In 1716, 2 explorers in the Spanish service, Louis Juchereau de St.
Denis and Domingo Ramón, led an expedition that passed through the area and camped on
Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River, naming them respectively Arroyo de las Bendítas
Ánimas and Rio de San Xavier. The San Xavier missions, which were founded in the mid-18th
century and occupied a series of sites along the San Gabriel River, were just across the eastern
border of Williamson County in present-day Milam County, and the area was extensively
explored by the Spanish. During the Mexican period, parts of the county were awarded as land
grants, first to several Mexican families, then as part of Robertson’s colony, but no settlement
resulted from these grants.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Anglo settlement began during the Texas Revolution and the early days of the Republic
of Texas, when the area was part of Milam County. In 1835, in an attempt to strengthen the
frontier against Indian attack, a military post was built near the headwaters of Brushy Creek in
what would become southwestern Williamson County and was named for Capt. John J.
Tumlinson, Jr., the commander of the company of Texas Rangers who garrisoned the post.
The post was abandoned in February of 1836, when its garrison was withdrawn to deal with the
Mexican invasion. In 1838, the first civilian settlement was established by Dr. Thomas Kenney
and a party of settlers who built a fort, named Kenney’s Fort, on Brushy Creek near the site of
the present-day crossing of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. Several other sites on Brushy
Creek were settled soon after, but Indian raids kept Anglo settlement in check, and a number of
the early pioneers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians over the next few years.
In 1842, many of the early farms were abandoned when Governor Sam Houston advised
settlers to pull back from the frontier. The Indian threat eased after 1846, and part of the influx
of settlers who came to Texas after its annexation traveled to the frontier along Brushy Creek
and the San Gabriel River. By 1848, there were at least 250 settlers in what was then western
Milam County, and in the early months of that year, 107 of them signed a petition to organize a
new county. Recognizing that the petitioners needed a seat of local government that was
considerably closer to them than Milam County, the Texas legislature established Williamson
County on March 13, 1848, naming it for prominent judge and soldier Robert M. Williamson.
Georgetown, the county seat, was laid out during the summer of that year, and the district court
was in session by October. According to the census of 1850, Williamson County had a
population of 1379 Anglos and 155 slaves living in agricultural communities on Brushy Creek
and the San Gabriel. As was common in other frontier counties, most of the improved acreage
was used to grow corn. Three families owned 15 or more slaves in 1850, but family farms and
subsistence agriculture remained the norm prior to the Civil War. While most of the settlers had
moved to Texas from other southern states, particularly Tennessee, a substantial contingent
came from Vermilion County, Illinois; and this latter group remained pro-Union and Republican
in its political orientation during the secession crisis.
On the eve of the Civil War, Williamson County had moved beyond the frontier stage
and was a populous, agriculturally diverse county. The Anglo population tripled between 1850
and 1860 to 3638, while the slave population grew even more dramatically to 891, 6 times the
number of slaves in 1850. Agricultural pursuits were quite varied and reflected the county’s
geographical diversity. Farmers used the rich blackland soils in the eastern half of the county to
grow wheat and corn. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but only 271 bales were grown in
1860, and it was not an important cash crop for most farmers. The early settlers had found
large herds of wild cattle in the 1840s, and cattle ranching for both home consumption and the
market was widespread throughout the county by 1860. The number of cattle on county
ranches had more than tripled from 11,973 head in 1850 to 38,114 head in 1860. Similarly, the
number of sheep grew from 2937 producing 3499 pounds of wool in 1850 to 16,952 sheep and
32,994 pounds of wool in 1860.
Williamson County was marked by political divisions during the secession crisis,
divisions that were carried over into the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unionist sentiment was

14

strong in the county, and a resolution denouncing secession was adopted by a Texas
Constitutional Union party meeting in Round Rock in 1860. One of the county’s delegates to the
secession convention, Thomas Proctor Hughes, was among the 8 who voted against the
ordinance of secession. When the ordinance was referred to a statewide election, Williamson
County was one of 19 counties to oppose it, rejecting secession by 480 to 349 votes. When the
war came, most of the citizens of Williamson County supported the Confederate cause, and at
least 5 companies were raised in the county: an independent “spy” company under James O.
Rice, a company of Texas Rangers for border defense under William C. Dalrymple, and
companies in the Fourth, Seventh, and Sixteenth Texas Cavalry regiments. While some of
those who had opposed secession became active Confederate supporters, others remained
loyal to the Union and fled to Mexico or the North, and a number enlisted in the Union army. In
July 1863, 8 Williamson County men were caught by Confederate troops while traveling to
Mexico and were hanged near Bandera, Texas, and other Unionists were persecuted during the
war. The pattern of violence within the community continued into the summer following the end
of the war, when several men were arrested for “flagrant crimes” and “illegal persecution of
Union men.” In September 1865, a mass meeting of the citizens of Williamson County was held
on the San Gabriel River near Georgetown, and the gathering set a general tone of
reconciliation, which seems to have characterized the Reconstruction period in Williamson
County, a period that ended with the return of county government to conservative Democratic
control in 1869. Freed slaves formed several new communities, and the county seems to have
been free of much of the political and racial strife that occurred in other Texas counties during
Reconstruction. On the other hand, there was a great deal of crime, much of it violent, in the
latter 19th century. Horse and cattle thieves and some of the more famous outlaws of the day,
such as Sam Bass and John Wesley Hardin, preyed on the property of citizens, and long-term
family feuds and drunken brawls at the various saloons in the towns added to the toll of
homicides.
Though the Civil War had caused little material damage in the area, the county was a
much poorer place in 1870 than it had been in 1860. The total value of farms had fallen from
$833,418 to $389,239 and the value of livestock from $823,653 to $341,794. The economic
recovery in the 1870s was aided by the growth of the cattle and sheep industries and a dramatic
expansion of cotton farming. Various feeder routes to the Chisholm Trail passed through
Williamson County, and many cattle drives passed through or originated in the county from the
1860s through the early 1880s. With the coming of the railroads to the county in the 1870s,
Taylor, in the eastern part of the county, became an important rail center for the cattle trade.
Cattle-raising, after declining somewhat in importance in the early 20th century, was again a
major part of the agricultural economy by 1950, and in 1969 ranchers owned a record
65,093 cattle. Sheep- and goat-raising followed a similar pattern. Sheep ranching recovered its
pre-war level by 1880 and peaked at 39,961 sheep and 171,752 pounds of wool in 1890, then
declined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to 13,397 sheep and 39,458 pounds in 1920.
The industry revived in the 1930s and reached a new high of 59,919 sheep and 336,494 pounds
of wool in 1959. Mohair became a significant agricultural product by 1930 and reached a peak
in 1959, when 44,668 goats produced 209,098 pounds of mohair. Cotton, the second boom
industry in Williamson County, developed at about the same time as the cattle industry. As

HJN 140149 AR

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

early as 1869, the editor of the Georgetown Watchman was advising farmers to “make cotton,
but do not, by any means, neglect the grain crop-diversity.” Cotton production, which had been
insignificant before the war, rose to successive heights of 4,217 bales in 1880; 33,945 bales in
1890; and 80,514 bales in 1900. From 1900 to 1901, Williamson County ginned more cotton
than any county in Texas except Ellis County. The number of improved acres increased almost
tenfold from 1870 to 1880 and doubled again to 306,881 acres by 1890. The proportion of
cropland used for cotton production moved from about one-third of the total in 1880 to a high of
77% in 1910, and cotton was grown on 73% of the cropland as late as 1930. Dramatic changes
in land tenure attended the shift to cotton production. As late as 1880, 1183 of the 1538 farms,
or 77%, were still worked by owners. By 1890, only 43% of the farms were operated by owners,
and the percentage of owner-operators remained at 40% until the 1920s, when it dropped still
further to 29% in 1930. Farm tenancy rates began to decline during the Great Depression with
the shift away from cotton and other staple crops and by 1959 had dropped to 36% of the
county’s farmers.
Both the cattle and the cotton booms were aided by the improved communications
available in the county in the later 19th century. The International-Great Northern Railroad,
which later was consolidated with the Missouri Pacific, was built across the eastern part of the
county in 1876 and led to the founding of Taylor (now Williamson County’s third largest city) and
Hutto and to the relocation of Round Rock. It also opened up large areas in eastern Williamson
County to commercial farming. The Taylor, Bastrop, and Houston Railway, which was
eventually consolidated with the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railway, was built in the 1880s
and aided in the development of Taylor, Granger, and Bartlett. Roads were generally poor
throughout the county in the early 20th century. There were 11,882 automobiles in the county
by 1930, and extensive improvements, including blacktopping, of all major roads took place in
the 1930s.
The county also became more ethnically diverse in the later 19th and early 20th
centuries. While there were only 111 inhabitants of foreign birth out of a population of 6368 in
Williamson County in 1870, significant numbers of Scandinavians, Germans, Czechs, Wends,
and Austrians moved to the county in the 1880s and 1890s. The proportion of foreign-born in
the county population remained at about 10% from 1890 to the 1930s. Mexican immigration
reached a significant level by about 1910, just as Europeans stopped arriving in the county.
There were 294 Hispanics in 1900, 732 in 1910, and 4967, or 11% of the population, in 1930.
In 1980, 9693 residents, or again 11%, were of Hispanic origin. The immigrants added their
distinctive customs and architectural styles to the mix of county life and introduced new religious
denominations. By the time of the Civil War, Williamson County had a number of Baptist and
Methodist churches and several different factions of the Presbyterian Church. Churches of
other denominations were built after the war, and the new emigrants established Lutheran,
Catholic, and Czech Moravian congregations. By 1930, Williamson County had a culturally
diverse population of 44,146 inhabitants. The economy was still overwhelmingly agricultural;
only 29 manufacturing establishments employed 347 workers that year.
While cotton
production was near its peak in terms of percentage of cropland, the cotton industry was already
undergoing a rapid transformation.

The combined effects of soil depletion, overproduction, and the influx of the boll weevil
had already injured the profitability of the industry by the late 1920s, and the situation of cotton
growers was further worsened by the depression. The black population seems to have been
particularly hard hit by the depression. Of the 944 county families on relief in 1933, 442, almost
half, were black, though blacks constituted only 16% of the population. Various federal relief
programs benefited farmers with farm loans and subsidies, and in 1936 a total of $204,000 in
subsidy checks was issued. The Depression encouraged diversification among farmers and a
shift away from staple crops to livestock. Between 1930 and 1940, the number of acres used
for cotton-growing fell by almost half, and cotton production went from 68,266 to 36,890 bales.
Cropland acreage used for corn production increased over the same period by about half, and
wool and mohair production more than doubled to 342,983 and 102,517 pounds, respectively.
While cotton continued to be an important crop in eastern Williamson County, farmers
increasingly turned to other crops like sorghum and wheat and to livestock-raising in the latter
20th century. Along with such traditional livestock as sheep and cattle, poultry farming played a
significant role in the economy by 1950, when the county was fifth in the state in the production
of eggs and chickens. In 1980, it was 10th in the state in the production of turkeys.
The agricultural diversification of the middle decades of the 20th century was followed by
significant social and economic changes in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The black population,
which had remained at between 15 and 18% of the total in the early and mid-20th century,
began to decline, both proportionately and in real numbers, from the 1940s on and had fallen to
4,111, or about 5%, by 1980. As in other areas of Texas, blacks were relegated to segregated
and inferior housing and educational facilities until the 1960s, when some improvements were
brought about by federal desegregation policies. Along with changes in racial composition,
Williamson County experienced a dramatic increase in population during this period, growing
from 37,305 inhabitants in 1970 to an estimated 85,700 inhabitants in 1982, making it 34th in
population growth among counties in the US in the 1970s.

4.1

DATABASE REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) web site indicated the presence of 16 previously recorded archeological sites within
a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the Project Area (THC 2014), while a review of the National
Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer
indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review radius
(NPS 2014). These documented cultural resources are summarized in Table 4-1, while their
locations relative to the Project Area are presented in Figure 4-1.
Of the 16 previously recorded sites, 8 sites were recorded as prehistoric campsites. Six
of these 8 prehistoric campsites currently have undetermined eligibility statuses for listing on the
NRHP and/or for designation as SALs. Of the remaining 2 prehistoric campsites, site 41WM964
was recommended as eligible for listing on the NRHP and/or for designation as an SAL, while
41WM235 has a formal designation as an SAL. Three of the 16 previously recorded sites were
recorded as prehistoric lithic scatters, and all 3 sites are considered ineligible for listing on the
NRHP and for formal designation as an SAL. The remaining 5 sites were either recorded as
unknown prehistoric sites or insufficient site data were available at the time of the review to
determine site types or dates of occupation. The eligibility of these 5 sites for listing on the
NRHP and for designation as SALs is currently undetermined.
Fifteen of the 16 known sites are located outside the boundaries of the Project Area.
One of these 16 known sites, site 41WM235 (also known as the Wilson-Leonard site), is located
within the boundaries of the Project Area (see Figure 4-1). Site 41WM235 is a deeply stratified
archeological site containing evidence of 11,000 years of prehistoric occupation along the
southwestern banks of Brushy Creek. Site 41WM235 was originally discovered in 1973.
Extensive excavations were conducted on this site from 1982 to 1984 under the direction of the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) prior to the construction of FM 1431. Later
investigations (1992 to 1994) on the site were conducted under the auspices of the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) of The University of Texas at Austin under contract
to TxDOT (Collins 1998).

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the location of the Project Area on
an alluvial terrace of Brushy Creek, as well as the presence of previously documented portions
of site 41WM235 within the boundaries of the Project Area, it was Horizon’s original opinion
(i.e., prior to field efforts) that there existed a high potential for undocumented prehistoric
cultural deposits within the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, no structures are visible within the boundaries of the
Project Area as seen on the 2014 Google Earth imagery. Additionally, no structures appear
within the boundaries of the Project Area on the relevant 1987 USGS 7.5-minute Leander,
Texas, topographic quadrangle. Due to the lack of any visible historic-era structures in
proximity to the Project Area, it was Horizon’s original opinion (i.e., prior to field efforts), that
there existed a low potential for historic-era architectural or archeological resources within the
Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the Project Area on September 5, 2014. This entailed intensive surface inspection as well as
subsurface shovel testing. The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for
linear projects up to 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) in width. As such, a total of 1 shovel test was
needed within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. However, the THC
requested that Horizon exceed the TSMASS requirements and decrease the shovel testing
interval to 10.0-meter (32.8-foot) intervals within the Project Area in order to determine the
presence and density of cultural materials and/or cultural features associated with site
41WM235 in this area. As such, Horizon excavated 8 shovel tests within the Project Area,
thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements but falling short of the recommended number of
9 shovel tests requested by the THC. A subsurface burned rock midden was observed within
the northwestern portion of the Project Area. One shovel test excavated into the burned rock
midden demonstrated that the feature contained intact, stratified archeological deposits.
Horizon opted not to excavate multiple shovel tests into this feature in order to not further
damage the deposits. All excavated matrices were screened through 6.35-millimeter (0.25-inch)
hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
In general, shovel tests measured approximately 30.0 centimeters (11.8 inches) in
diameter and were excavated to a target depth of 1.0 meters (3.3 feet) below ground surface, to
the top of pre-Holocene deposits, or to the maximum depth practicable. In practice, most shovel
tests were terminated at depths of 70.0 to 100.0 centimeters (27.6 to 39.4 inches) below surface
due to the presence of gravelly, silty clay loam; dense burned rock midden deposits; and natural
limestone gravels. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via hand-held global
positioning system (GPS) units utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate
system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test locations are presented
in Figure 5-1, and shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.
The TSMASS also require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas with
the potential to contain buried archeological materials at depths below those that shovel tests
are capable of reaching (approximately 1.0 meters [3.3 feet] below surface). The Project Area
is located within an alluvial terrace setting and Holocene-age loamy alluvial sediments are
mapped along Brushy Creek within the Project Area. Shovel tests typically encountered
gravelly, silty clay loam sediments extending to depths of at least 80.0 centimeters (31.5 inches)
below surface. Since these alluvial soils have the potential to contain deeply buried cultural

deposits and shovel tests were not capable of fully penetrating to the bottom of these
sediments, mechanical trenching would be required within the Project Area to assess the
potential for buried cultural deposits in the event that deep, subsurface impacts would occur
within the Project Area. However, Milestone was not anticipating any subsurface impacts to any
portion of the Project Area that contains site 41WM235. As such, for current purposes, shovel
testing was considered to constitute an adequate and effective survey technique for evaluating
archeological resources within the Project Area, and mechanical trenching was consequently
not employed as a site-evaluation technique.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

The cultural resources survey resulted in the reassessment of a portion of previously
documented site 41WM235 within the Project Area. A detailed description of the portion of the
site within the Project Area is presented below.

6.1

SITE 41WM235
General Description

Site 41WM235, also known as the Wilson-Leonard site, represents the remains of an
extensive prehistoric campsite located approximately 335.0 meters (1,098.8 feet) east of the
intersection of Parmer Lane (FM 734) and FM 1431 in Cedar Park in Williamson County. The
site is situated on an alluvial terrace adjacent to (west of) Brushy Creek at elevations ranging
from 240.9 to 248.5 meters (790.0 to 815.0 feet) amsl (Figures 6-1 and 6-2). Vegetation
consists of bull nettle, cacti, and short to medium grasses, with scattered stands of Ashe juniper,
hackberry, and oak trees closer to the creek (Figures 6-3 and 6-4). Overall, the boundaries of
site 41WM235 measure approximately 145.0 meters (475.6 feet) northwest to southeast by
185.0 meters (606.8 feet) west to east. However, as documented during the current survey, the
portion of the site within the Project Area measures approximately 91.5 meters (300.0 feet) in
length by 15.2 meters (50.0 feet) in width. Based on the extent of the terrace landform and
associated upland, the site extends farther west, east, and north along the upland formation.
Only those portions of site 41WM235 that fall within the limits of the Project Area were
investigated in compliance with the ACT.
A total of 8 shovel tests were excavated on the portion of site 41WM235 that falls within
the Project Area (see Figure 6-2). Most of these shovel tests produced evidence of subsurface
cultural deposits up to 70.0 to 100.0 centimeters (27.6 to 39.4 inches) below ground surface.
Observed Cultural Materials
Prehistoric cultural materials observed within the Project Area include a moderate- to
high-density scatter of lithic debitage, including 1 primary flake, 47 secondary flakes, 440 tertiary
flakes, and 1 piece of angular debris (Figures 6-5 to 6-7). One projectile point fragment with a
broad, triangular body with strong shoulders and a short expanding stem reminiscent of a
Marshall point was observed on site 41WM235 (Figure 6-8). The presence of the possible

Marshall point suggests a Middle Archaic component associated with the burned rock midden
(ca. 2000 B.C to 1200 B.C.) (Turner and Hester 1999). Two other projectile point fragments
were not temporally diagnostic beyond broadly indicating a prehistoric affiliation.
All lithic specimens observed on the site were manufactured from medium- to finegrained, light to dark gray Edwards Formation chert. Additional artifacts observed on site
41WM235 include very high densities of burned rocks (Figure 6-9). The densities of burned
rocks were so high that they were not quantified. Twenty-one skeletal elements were observed
in 5 shovel tests excavated on site 41WM235 (Figures 6-10 and 6-11). The majority of the
skeletal elements are clearly non-human remains, although several of the bone fragments could
not be identified. However, given the context of these remains in association with the identified
non-human remains, it is likely these elements also represent non-human remains. The skeletal
remains do not appear to represent an intact human burial and are not associated with identified
burial features. No preserved floral remains were observed on the modern ground surface or
within any of the shovel tests excavated during the survey.
Cultural Features
One prominent prehistoric feature, an apparent burned rock midden, was observed on
site 41WM235 within the northern portion of the Project Area (Figures 6-12 to 6-16; see also
Figure 6-2). Burned rock middens are common cultural features on sites located along the
banks of Brushy Creek, as well as on other prehistoric sites in Central Texas. These middens
are essentially prehistoric trash piles composed of discarded cooking rocks and occupational
debris that have accumulated over time as a result of continual reoccupation of the site. Burned
rock middens are common throughout much of prehistory but are most common during the
Middle and Late Archaic periods (Collins 1995). The presence of a possible Marshall point,
which dates to the Middle Archaic period, observed within the investigated midden deposits on
site 41WM235 is consistent with this timeframe. It is important to note that human remains have
been observed in association with archeological deposits similar to those observed on site
41WM235 on other sites in proximity to the Project Area, such as sites 41WM807 and
41WM1029. No human remains were observed on site 41WM235 during the current survey,
although based upon the presence of preserved faunal remains in the investigated burned rock
midden and the documented presence of human remains elsewhere on site 41WM235 beyond
the boundaries of the current Project Area, the potential exists for preserved human remains to
be located within these deposits.
The burned rock midden measures approximately 30.5 meters (100.0 feet) northwest to
southeast by 25.0 meters (82.0 feet) northeast to southwest (see Figure 6-2). The majority of
the burned rock midden feature within the Project Area was visible on the modern ground
surface. The feature exhibited a mounded appearance with a slightly higher elevation near the
central portion of the feature than along the edges. Burned rock midden debris was scattered
across the modern ground surface in this area. Shovel testing efforts within the Project Area
provided limited exposure of this feature and the horizontal extent of the deposit was
determined based primarily upon the visibility of this deposit on the surface of site 41WM235.

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

The vertical extent of the burned rock midden measures at least 1.0 meters (3.3 feet)
below the modern ground surface near the apparent apex of the feature. One shovel test was
excavated in the center of the feature to determine the depth of the deposit. High densities of
burned rock specimens within this shovel test (JC1) made excavations difficult. The shovel test
was terminated at 1.0 meters (3.3 feet) below ground surface, though it is possible that the
deposit extends below 1.0 meters (3.3 feet). A larger exposure of this cultural feature would be
needed in order to identify the base of the deposit in this location on the site; as such, the exact
vertical extent of the deposit is unknown at this time.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based upon the original site investigations, the overall dimensions of site 41WM235
measure approximately 145.0 meters (475.6 feet) northwest to southeast by 185.0 meters
(606.8 feet) west to east. The current Project Area, measuring 91.5 meters (300.0 feet) in
length by 15.2 meters (50.0 feet) in width, is located entirely within the known site boundaries
(see Figure 6-1). Only those portions of site 41WM235 that fall within the limits of the Project
Area were investigated during the current project in compliance with the ACT.
A total of 8 shovel tests excavated on the portion of site 41WM235 within the Project
Area revealed up to 1.0 meters (3.3 feet) of grayish-brown to very dark grayish-brown silty clay
loam and gravelly clay loam. Several of the shovel tests excavated toward the northwestern
end of the Project Area contained high densities (up to 90% of the matrix) of burned rocks.
Most shovel tests were terminated between 70.0 to 100.0 centimeters (27.6 to 39.4 inches)
below surface due to the density of burned rocks, though some shovel tests reached the target
depth of 1.0 meters (3.3 feet) below surface. Cultural materials were observed in all 8 shovel
tests excavated during the survey, and subsurface archeological deposits extended to depths of
at least 1.0 meters (3.3 feet) below surface in 2 of the 8 shovel tests. The highest densities of
cultural materials were observed between 30.0 and 90.0 centimeters (11.8 and 35.4 inches)
below surface.
Site Summary
Site 41WM235 represents the remains of an extensive prehistoric campsite situated on
an alluvial terrace adjacent to (west of) Brushy Creek. Overall, the boundaries of site 41WM235
measure approximately 145.0 meters (475.6 feet) northwest to southeast by 185.0 meters
(606.8 feet) west to east. However, as documented during the current survey, the portion of the
site within the Project Area measures approximately 91.5 meters (300.0 feet) in length by
15.2 meters (50.0 feet) in width. Based on the extent of the terrace landform and associated
upland and the known site boundaries based on prior investigations, the site extends farther
west, east, and north along the upland formation. Only those portions of site 41WM235 that fall
within the limits of the Project Area were investigated in compliance with the ACT.
A total of 8 shovel tests were excavated on the portion of site 41WM235 that falls within
the Project Area (see Figure 6-2). All 8 of these shovel tests produced evidence of subsurface
cultural deposits up to 80.0 to 100.0 centimeters (31.5 to 39.4 inches) below ground surface.

One notable cultural feature was observed within the Project Area consisting of a burned
rock midden present on the modern ground surface and extending to at least 1.0 meters
(3.3 feet) in depth. High densities of burned rocks, lithic debitage, faunal remains, and a
possible Marshall projectile point were observed in association with the feature.
The portion of site 41WM235 within the Project Area has a formal designation as an
SAL. Based upon the temporally diagnostic projectile point fragment, the presence of an intact
cultural feature, the presence of preserved faunal remains, and the presence of apparently
intact archeological deposits, it is Horizon opinion that the portion of site 41WM235 located
within the Project Area is a contributing element to the site’s formal designation as an SAL.
Horizon therefore recommended avoidance and protection of site 41WM235 during construction
and development within the Project Area.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

The survey of the Project Area resulted in the reassessment of a portion of site
41WM235. The Wilson-Leonard site, 41WM235, is an extensive prehistoric campsite adjacent
to (west of) Brushy Creek. Eight shovel tests excavated within the Project Area revealed high
densities of cultural materials in subsurface contexts up to 1.0 meters (3.3 feet) below ground
surface. Additionally, a large burned rock midden was observed in surface contexts within the
northern portion of the Project Area, and cultural materials associated with this feature were
also observed in subsurface contexts up to 80.0 to 100.0 centimeters (31.5 to 39.4 inches)
below ground surface. High densities of burned rocks, faunal bone, and lithic debitage were
observed within this feature. The presence of a possible Marshall point fragment tentatively
dates the feature to the Middle Archaic period.

7.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

The portion of site 41WM235 that falls within the Project Area has been formally
designated as an SAL. Based upon a temporally diagnostic projectile point fragment, the
presence of an intact cultural feature, the presence of preserved faunal remains, and the
presence of buried, stratified archeological deposits, it was Horizon’s opinion that the portion of
site 41WM235 located within the Project Area is a contributing element to the site’s overall SAL
designation. Horizon recommended avoidance and protection of site 41WM235 during
construction and development within the Project Area.
With the assistance of Horizon, Milestone consulted with the THC regarding
recommendations for proper avoidance and protection strategies regarding the portion of site
41WM235 that falls within the Project Area. Horizon recommended that Milestone bury the
portion of site 41WM235 within the Project Area. In accordance with this recommendation, the
THC suggested that 0.9 to 1.5 meters (3.0 to 5.0 feet) of artificial fill be placed over the portion
of site 41WM235 that falls within the Project Area in order to cap and protect the cultural
deposits observed here. Additionally, the THC required that all drainage culverts, electrical and
utility installations, irrigation systems, landscaping designs, and road signage within the Project
Area be installed no deeper than the base of the artificial fill to be placed over site 41WM235.
Horizon assisted Milestone in the development of an archeological monitoring plan, which was
approved by the THC in September 2014. The monitoring plan stipulated that an archeological
monitor would be present on-site daily during all construction activities, including fill deposition

HJN 140149 AR

41

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

and subsequent grading related to placing protective fill on the portion of site 41WM235 within
the Project Area. Milestone agreed to place at least 0.9 meters (3.0 feet) of artificial fill over the
portion of site 41WM235 within the Project Area in order to avoid any adverse effects to
archeological deposits on the site and also committed to the presence of the on-site
archeological monitor. The proposed construction plans are presented in Appendix B, and the
approved archeological monitoring plan is presented in Appendix C.
The proposed development plans showed that no utility or wastewater lines were to be
installed within the Project Area; however, 2 storm water culverts were to be installed near the
northern and central portions of the Project Area. Milestone indicated that the construction of
both drainage culverts would occur entirely within the artificial fill to be placed over site
41WM235. Milestone also indicated that the placement of any road signage, irrigation systems,
and landscaping efforts also would be entirely constructed within the required fill materials to be
placed over site 41WM235.
Pursuant to the implementation of the approved monitoring plan, the THC granted
permission for the capping and filling operations on the portion of site 41WM235 within the
Project Area.
Horizon was notified on September 23, 2015, that the deposition of artificial fill within the
Project Area had begun, and Horizon mobilized to the field that same day. Upon arriving,
Horizon’s archeological monitor observed that the initial layers of artificial fill had already been
deposited within the Project Area; as such, it was not possible to observe the initial stages of
ground preparation and fill deposition. The archeological monitor performed a thorough
inspection of the private property located adjacent to the edges of the Project Area and
observed that no natural sediments containing archeological deposits appeared to have been
displaced. Subsequently, Milestone provided photographs taken by the construction inspector
on the day on which the Project Area was initially prepared for deposition of artificial fill. Based
on these photographs, it appears that only minimal vegetation-clearing activities were
undertaken prior to fill deposition and that no archeological deposits were disturbed.
Horizon conducted archeological monitoring on several subsequent dates in connection
with the installation of various utilities within the artificial fill section, including installation of
storm sewers on December 1, 2015; the installation of water irrigation lines on December 11,
2015; the installation of electrical utility lines on January 11, 2016; and drilling associated with
construction of a new Pedernales Electric Cooperative (PEC) power pole on January 29, 2016.
While the power pole drilling was technically outside the scope of the current project as it was
constructed within PEC’s existing easement within the FM 1431 right-of-way (ROW) and
therefore outside of the Project Area, Horizon’s presence was nevertheless requested as a
good-faith effort to ensure that no significant archeological deposits were disturbed. No
archeological deposits were observed within the spoil excavated from the power pole footprint.
Horizon monitors were present on-site during all construction activities conducted within the
Project Area subsequent to the initial devegetation and fill deposition activities. All of the
construction activities within the Project Area were conducted entirely within the artificial fill
embankment. No natural sediments underlying the artificial fill containing archeological deposits
were disturbed during construction of the access road. The filling and capping activities

represented an effective method of avoiding impacts to the archeological deposits within the
Project Area, and there were no adverse effects to site 41WM235 within the Project Area.
At this time, proposed construction within the Project Area has been completed and no
further archeological investigations are warranted in connection with the proposed undertaking.
However, in the event that construction plans should change or that future subsurface
disturbances to the portion of site 41WM235 located within the Project Area cannot be avoided
for any reason, Horizon recommends that Milestone consult with the THC before commencing
any ground-disturbing activities. Additionally, in the event that any additional cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the Project Area, even in previously surveyed
areas, all work within 7.6 meters (25.0 feet) of the location of the inadvertent discovery should
cease immediately and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

September 23, 2015
At approximately 11:00 a.m. on September 23, 2015, Horizon Environmental Services,
Inc. (Horizon), was notified by Brenda Searle-Sung, Milestone Parmer Development, LLC’s
(Milestone), current project manager for the Whitestone Condominium project, that deposition of
artificial fill materials had begun within an approximately 91.5-meter- (300.0-foot-) long by 15.2meter- (50.0-foot-) wide access road easement (Project Area) associated with the larger
Whitestone Condominium project. Based on the results of Horizon’s cultural resources survey,
archeological deposits had been found within the Project Area that were determined to be
contributing elements to site 41WM235 (also known as the Wilson-Leonard site). As site
41WM235 had been formerly designated as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL), any grounddisturbing activities within the Project Area would have an adverse effect on significant
archeological deposits. In consultation with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Milestone
had developed a filling and capping plan that would deposit at least 0.9 meters (3.0 feet) of
artificial fill materials on top of the natural ground surface within the Project Area, thereby
protecting and preserving the archeological deposits. All subsequent construction within the
Project Area, such as construction of storm water culverts and installation of utilities, would not
extend below the base of the artificial fill cap.
Horizon archeologist Jeffrey D. Owens, the project’s Principal Investigator, mobilized to
the field that same day. Upon arriving, the monitor observed that the initial layers of artificial fill
had already been deposited within the Project Area; as such, it was not possible to observe the
initial stages of ground preparation and fill deposition. Figures D-1 to D-12 depict the Project
Area on September 23. 2015. Artificial fill materials consisted of limestone gravels and crushed
caliche and ranged in depth from approximately 0.9 meters (3.0 feet) along the southwestern
edge of the proposed access road right-of-way (ROW) to as much as 1.5 meters (5.0 feet) along
the northeastern edge. The archeological monitor performed a thorough inspection of the
private property adjacent to the Project Area and observed that no natural sediments containing
archeological deposits appeared to have been displaced. Subsequently, Milestone provided a
photograph taken by the construction inspector at the time the Project Area was initially
prepared for deposition of artificial fill prior to Horizon’s field inspection (Figure D-13). The
photograph presented in Figure D-13 was taken by the construction inspector on September 10,
2015, after the fill marking stakes had been set out but before filling operations began. Note
that the construction inspector’s photograph, presented in Figure D-13, was taken in
approximately the same location as the photographs by Horizon’s archeological monitor on
September 23, 2015, presented in Figures D-9 and D-10. While the construction inspector’s
photograph shows only the southeastern end of the access road easement, it appears that only
minimal vegetation-clearing activities were undertaken prior to fill deposition and that no
archeological deposits were disturbed within the Project Area.
As construction activities being undertaken on September 23, 2015, actually consisted
only of compacting the fill materials that had already been deposited, Horizon’s activities on this
day consisted only of photo-documenting the construction activities conducted to date.

October 5, 2015
At the request of Milestone, Shannon Dorsey (Horizon’s project manager for this
project), Russell K. Brownlow (Horizon’s Cultural Resources Director), and Jeffrey D. Owens
(Horizon’s Principal Investigator for this project) met with Brenda Searle-Sung (Milestone’s
project manager for this project), Steve Walkup (Milestone’s Director of Land Development),
and Scott Walcher of Joe Bland Construction (the construction contractor) on the proposed
access road easement on the Whitestone Condominiums property. The intent of the meeting
was to discuss the archeological monitoring plan. To demonstrate a good-faith effort and to
comply with the spirit of the monitoring agreement, it was agreed that any future construction
activities within the easement, such as installation of utilities, would be monitored even though
these activities were not expressly outlined in the archeological monitoring plan. The goal of the
monitoring would be to ensure that no natural sediments containing archeological deposits
would be disturbed during ongoing construction activities undertaken within the artificial fill
section. Horizon also requested any photographs that may have been taken during the initial
vegetation-clearing activities and/or initial filling within the Project Area. In response to this
request, Milestone provided Horizon with the photograph taken by the construction inspector on
September 10, 2015, presented in Figure D-13, discussed above.

December 1, 2015
Milestone and Horizon exchanged emails about the upcoming construction schedule
within the access easement for several weeks, though there were multiple delays due to
excessive winter rains. Brenda Searle-Sung of Milestone notified Horizon on November 24,
2015, that Horizon was needed on-site to monitor construction of storm sewers within the
access road easement on December 1, 2015. Horizon emailed a confirmation request to
Milestone on November 30, 2015, to confirm the next day’s work and was informed that the
work was being postponed until December 3, 2015, due to wet conditions. However, at 11:10
a.m. on the morning of December 1, 2015, the originally scheduled day of construction, Brenda
Searle-Sung of Milestone contacted Jeffery D. Owens of Horizon to inform him that the
contractor had decided to proceed with construction that day and that Horizon’s presence was
required immediately.
Horizon archeological field technician Jared Wiersema was dispatched to the field that
same day, arriving at approximately 12:30 p.m. Excavation of the trenches for the storm water
pipes had begun by the time Mr. Wiersema arrived on-site, but the excavations had clearly been
limited to the artificial fill section, and no natural soils containing archeological deposits had
been disturbed (Figures D-14 to D-15). Two trenches had been cut across (perpendicular to)
the proposed access road that measured approximately 45.7 to 61.0 centimeters (18.0 to
24.0 inches) in diameter overall and widened out at either end to a maximum width of
approximately 3.0 meters (10.0 feet) at the locations of the spillways at the ends. Concrete
culverts were laid within the trenches and the trenches were backfilled, leaving several feet of
pipe exposed on either end. No natural sediments underlying the artificial fill section appeared
to have been disturbed during the excavation of the trenches.
The contractor informed Mr. Wiersema that a bundle of water irrigation lines was
scheduled to be installed within the access road easement on December 3, 2015, though Mr.
Wiersema was informed via a telephone call from Joe Bland Construction on the morning of
December 3, 2015, that this activity was being postposed to a later date
December 11, 2015
Horizon’s Jared Wiersema was contact by a construction foreman with Joe Bland
Construction at approximately 11:00 a.m. on the morning of December 11, 2015, and informed
that the planned installation of the irrigation water lines was planned within the access road
easement beginning as soon as possible. As Mr. Wiersema was already in the field on another
project, he contacted Jeffrey D. Owens, Horizon’s Principal Investigator for the project, and Mr.
Owens mobilized to the field, arriving at approximately 12:15 p.m. The contractor had waited for
Mr. Owens to arrive before beginning excavation.
The contractor excavated a shallow trench across the easement beginning at the
northwestern end of the access road near FM 1431 with a backhoe equipped with a 30.5centimeter- (12.0-inch-) wide bucket. The trench initially measured between 0.3 and 0.5 meters
(1.0 and 1.5 feet) in depth by about 0.9 meters (3.0 feet) in depth. However, after inspecting the
trench, the construction foreman indicated that the trench needed to be deeper. The trench was

subsequently extended to an overall depth of about 0.6 meters (2.0 feet) and 0.9 meters
(3.0 feet) in width (Figure D-16). The trench was excavated entirely within the artificial fill
section, and the bottom of the trench appeared to be at least 15.2 centimeters (6.0 inches)
above natural ground surface. A bundle of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe sections were laid
within the trench, and the trench was refilled with base materials. No natural soils or
archeological deposits were disturbed during the construction activities.
December 14, 2015
Horizon’s Jared Wiersema met with Joe Champlin of Joe Bland Construction as well as
an inspector representing Pedernales Electric Cooperative (PEC) at the job site at 1:30 p.m. on
December 14, 2015. After discussing plans to excavate an approximately 40.6-centimeter(16.0-inch-) wide by 1.2-meter- (4.0-foot-) electrical utility trench leading from an existing utility
pole located approximately 9.1 meters (30.0 feet) from the access road entrance. The proposed
trench would be excavated across private property adjacent to (west of) the proposed access
road easement. As the adjacent private property had not been included in Horizon’s prior
cultural resources survey or assessed to determine if contributing archeological deposits
associated with site 41WM235 may be present, this plan was abandoned pending further
consultation between Milestone, Joe Bland Construction, and PEC.

January 11, 2016
Horizon was contacted early in the morning on January 11, 2016, by Joe Champlin of
Joe Bland Construction and told that the plans for the power lines had been resolved and that
excavation was scheduled for that day to install the utility lines. Horizon’s Jeffrey D. Owens
arrived on-site at approximately 9:15 a.m. and monitored the trench excavation, installation of
PVC pipes for electrical utilities, and subsequent refilling and compaction of the trench. The
trench was excavated with a backhoe equipped with a 30.5-centimeter- (12.0-inch-) wide bucket
beginning at the northwestern corner of the access road easement at the edge of the FM 1431
right-of-way (ROW). The trench extended diagonally across the easement straight eastwards,
then turned southeastward to follow the edge of the road curbing along the northeastern edge of
the easement all the way to entrance to the main condominium property to the southeast
(Figures D-16 to D-17). The trench was excavated to depths ranging from 0.9 to 1.2 meters
(3.0 to 4.0 feet) below surface and was excavated entirely within the artificial fill materials.
Segments of PVC pipeline were installed within the trench, a thin layer of sand was deposited
atop the installed piping, and then crushed caliche pea gravel fill was used to refill the trench.
Areas within the access road were subsequently compacted with a roller and smoothed with a
Gradall. No underlying natural soils or archeological deposits were disturbed during the
trenching operations.
January 30, 2015
Mark Hauser, Land Development Project Manager with Milestone, contacted Horizon on
January 29, 2016, to notify Horizon that PEC would be drilling a hole for a power pole the
following day. On January 30, 2016, Horizon’s Jeffrey D. Owens arrived on-site at 10:00 a.m.
and monitored the excavation for the power pole base.
The power pole hole was actually being excavated within PEC’s existing utility easement
within the FM 1431 ROW; as such, the power pole hole was actually located outside of the
Project Area. Mr. Owens nevertheless monitored the excavation due to the proximity to the
burned rock midden that had been documented within the Project Area, which was now buried
under 0.9 to 1.5 meters (3.0 to 5.0 feet) of artificial fill materials. The power pole hole was
drilled with an approximately 20.3-centimeter- (8.0-inch-) diameter auger to a depth of
2.1 meters (7.0 feet) below surface, including about 1.2 meters (4.0 feet) of artificial fill material
and 0.9 meters (3.0 feet) of underlying soils. The auger drilled about 0.3 meters (1.0 feet) per
insertion, after which the drill bit was raised and spun to shake off the dense clayey soils
encountered below the gravel fill (Figure D-18). Mr. Owens stopped the auger operator after
every second or third spin cycle in order to inspect the pile of auger spoil for cultural resources.
No cultural resources of any kind were observed in the auger spoil, and it is clear that the
burned rock midden observed within the Project Area to the southeast does not extend into this
area. It took approximately 30 minutes to complete the excavation, at which point the hole was
covered. PEC was scheduled to return within the next few days to set the pole, but no further
excavations were required. While PEC’s power pole excavation was outside the scope of
Milestone’s responsibilities, no archeological deposits were impacted during PEC’s operations.
