ABSTRACT

During early December of 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of approximately 118
undisturbed acres within the approximately 211 acre IESI East Texas
Landfill located approximately 4.96 miles southeast of Henderson in Rusk
County, Texas. The survey was done for IESI TX Corporation which
intends to create more cells for trash disposal. The “undisturbed” portion
of the landfill was heavily disturbed in places due to the construction of
roads, bulldozing activities and erosion. No cultural materials were seen
on the ground surface or uncovered in 64 shovel tests.
Based upon the absence of archaeological sites, it is recommended that
further archaeological investigations are unwarranted in conjunction with
the permitting of this landfill expansion, but the Texas Historical
Commission should be immediately notified if buried cultural features are
uncovered during construction.

INTRODUCTION
During early December of 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of approximately 118 “undisturbed” acres within the
approximately 211 acre East Texas Regional Landfill which is located approximately
4.96 miles southeast of Henderson in Rusk County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). IESI TX
Corporation intends to create for cells for trash disposal within the landfill. The
rectangular-shaped tract of land is located north of and adjacent to FM 2867. The
northern boundary is slightly over a mile north of FM 2867 and the western boundary is
about 2,060 feet east of CR 304 (Figure 1). Almost all of the landfill is located in an
upland situation, but an intermittent tributary to Dry Creek and an intermittent drainage
are present in the tract. Since this is a private entity, no Texas Antiquities Permit is
required.
The purpose of this investigation was to locate any cultural resources present within the
areas of potential effect within the tract and make recommendations about archaeological
site significance and how the sites might be impacted by construction. The study is
appropriate for federal permitting for an application for the expansion of a solid waste
landfill site. This report has been prepared for review by the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission as part of their Section 106 review process. Relevant
federal legislation includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended
(PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and the
Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291).
This report was written in accordance with report guidelines adopted by the Texas
Historical Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (ND). The following report presents a brief description of the natural and
cultural resources of the area. The research design and methodology and then the results
of the field investigation follow. A section which offers recommendations concludes the
body of the report. A list of references cited follows.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

Rusk County is located on the Sabine Uplift of the Gulf Coastal Plain. The terrain
consists of sloping hills and narrow valleys and glens. The ridges are usually capped by
ironstone in the northern and northeastern portions of the county, but sandy loam
underlain by clay is present throughout the county. Lignite also is present which is mined.
The clay is used in brick manufacturing. (Knapp and Biesele 2007:1).
The landfill is located in the heart of the Mixed Pine-Hardwood Forest plant community
which is part of the Piney Woods region of northeast Texas (Diamond, Riskind, and
Orzell 1987: Figure 1). Major timber trees are loblolly and shortleaf pine; post, blackjack,
and southern red oak; hickory; and sweetgum. Other hardwood associations are found in
low, wet bottomlands where overcup, water, willow, and Shumard oak; sugar hackberry;
American hornbeam; and elms grow. Understory vegetation includes greenbriar, sumac,
poison ivy, yaupon, crape myrtle, dogwood, and many other species. This is in the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950: Figure 1) where a variety of mammals are
native residents. These include raccoon, opossum, squirrel, white-tail deer, beaver,
muskrat, and cottontail rabbit. Aquatic animals include turtles, snakes, fish, and mussels.
The landfill is located within the Cuthbert-Kirvin-Bowie Soil Association which consists
of very gently sloping to steep clays and loams (Griffith 2000:General Soils Map, p. 13).
A wide variety of soils are located within the study area (Griffith 2000:Sheet 23).. The
soil types consist of Bernaldo very fine sandy loam with 5 to 8 percent slopes, Bowie
very fine sand with 1 to 4 percent slopes, Cuthbert fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent
slopes, Cuthbert gravelly fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent slopes, Kirvin fine sandy
loam with 2 to 5 and 5 to 15 percent slopes, graded Kervin soils with 2 to 8 percent
slopes, frequently flooded Laneville loam, Latex very fine sandy loam with 1 to 3 percent
slopes, Lilbert loamy fine sand with 2 to 5 percent slopes and Maben fine sandy loam
with 5 to 15 percent slopes, pits, Rentzel loamy fine sand with 0 to 4 percent slopes and
Sawlit loam with 0 to 2 percent slopes (Natural Resources Conservation Service 2007).
The underlying bedrock consists of the Eocene-aged undivided Wilcox Group and
Carrizo Sand. The Wilcox Group consists mainly of silty and sandy clay which is
conformably overlain by the Carrizo Sand. Ironstone is found in the Carrizo Sand
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1965).

CULTURE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The Paleo-Indian stage is widely accepted as the earliest period (10,000 to 6,000 B.C.) in
North America. Sites in East Texas with undisturbed Paleo-Indian occupations are
virtually non-existent. Distinctive projectile point styles including Clovis (Meltzer and
Bever 2007), along with Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, Scottsbluff, Angostura, and
Plainview have been reported from more recent, disturbed or surface contexts from the
surrounding parts of Northeast Texas, but the only reported buried Paleo-Indian
components have been reported from a survey of the proposed Big Sandy Reservoir in
Wood and Upshur Counties (Perttula et al. 1986:49).
The Archaic stage continues from about 6000 B.C. and lasts to the beginning of the
subsequent Early Ceramic or Woodland stage about 400 B.C. During this time period, the
migratory hunting and gathering cultures expanded exploitation of various ecological
niches and developed a more varied artifact assemblage. There is evidence of settling in
to the local environment and using available natural resources, particularly lithics which
resulted in the appearance of tools which were not as technologically advanced as those
found in Paleo-Indian contexts and were made using local gravels. Terraces and flood
plain projections are noted as the preferred locations for sites, but it is possible that
deeply buried sites have generally not been recognized. Throughout this period there is an
increasing number of sites, and by the Late Archaic, sites are commonly present along
tributaries of major drainages.
The Early Ceramic stage lasts from 400 B.C. to A.D. 800 and is sometimes referred to as
the Woodland stage. Although represented by the presence of exotic pottery types
attributed to the Lower Mississippi River Valley (Story 1990) and by earthen mounds
such as at the Coral Snake and Jonas Short sites (Jelks 1965; Jenson 1968). Although
generally related to the Woodland/Hopewellian cultures of the Red River and Lower
Mississippi River Valley, little information is available from East Texas for this time
period.
The Caddoan stage is considered to have evolved from the Early Ceramic and lasted until
A.D. 1680 which signals the beginning of the Historic, or Contact, period. Various
temporal, evolutionary, and cultural divisions have been offered for this time period
which is attributed to the ancestors of the historic Caddo Indians who inhabited East
Texas. Mound centers and village sites are known to occur on terraces of major streams
and in the valleys of minor tributaries. The prehistoric Caddo people were involved in
trade networks and practiced ritual burials which suggest that they were a stratified
society. Horticulture and agriculture supplemented the food stuffs obtained from hunting
and gathering (Perttula 1993). Investigations in the Martin Lake area have identified
numerous prehistoric Caddoan sites, probably the best known of these sites is the Oak
Hill site (Cruse 1995).

The Caddoan were still living in East Texas when the first Spanish explorers visited the
area (Perttula 1992) but permanent Spanish settlement in the area did not begin until the
late 1600s in response to French intrusions at Matagorda Bay and in western Louisiana.
The ethnohistoric Caddo have been described by several writers but the archaeology of
these historic Native American groups is poorly known (Clark and Ivey 1974; Jones
1968), although the historic Allen and Kinsloe phases have been described. In the 1820s
and 1830s, the historic Cherokee and Shawnee tribes occupied the western part of Rusk
County (Knapp and Biesele 2007:2).
In the 1760s, the Spanish abandoned the area of East Texas although they retained
ownership until 1803. Settlers began to occupy the county in the 1830s. Many of these
early people arrived via Trammel’s Trace which was the earliest route through the survey
area (Winfrey 1961) and roughly coincides with County Line Road. By the 1850s, Rusk
County was inundated by the influx of settlers from the Old South (Knapp and Biesele
2007:2).
Rusk County was formed on January 16. 1843. Plantations were present and wide variety
of other economic pursuits such as farming, carpentry, the law and merchandising were
present. Corn, followed by cotton, wheat and sugarcane, was the dominant crop. The end
of the Civil War brought disaster to the county’s economy, but during the 1870s, the
county began to recover. Interestingly, very little violence occurred between federal
troops stationed to protect the freed slaves and the county residents. Most of the freed
slaves either worked for their former employers or became tenant farmers (Knapp and
Biesele 2007:3-4).
The petroleum industry entered the economic picture in the early 1910s. The discovery of
the East Texas Oilfield in the 1927 was one of the richest in the United States. Although
it is not near its former glory, the petroleum industry still is an important aspect of the
Rusk County’s economy along with agriculture, clay and brick manufacturing, lignite
mining, lumbering and various other industries (Knapp and Biesele 2007:4-6).
Previous Investigations
Numerous cultural resource investigations have been conducted in Rusk County. The two
major areas surveyed were Martin Lake and the Oak Hill Mine which was excavated by
TXU Mining. The Martin Lake area which is on the border of Rusk and Panola Counties
was surveyed by McDonald (1972) who recorded 41 archaeological sites. Two years
later, Clark and Ivey (1974) recorded forty-four prehistoric sites and nine historic 19th
and 20th century sites. Prehistoric sites ranged from Late Archaic to Historic Indian (post
AD 1541). Since 1974, numerous other surveys as well as testing sites for determination
of their eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places (NHRP) has occurred
(Moncure and Jackson 1982; Jackson 1982, 1983; Davis et al. 1984; Taylor and Tate
1997; Skinner 1998). These surveys and excavations resulted in the recording of
numerous new prehistoric and historic sites as well as the recommendation that several of
______________________________________________________________________________________

8

the sites were considered eligible for nomination to the NHRP within approximately
10,000 acres. Of special interest in the lake area was the recording of several AfricanAmerican farms (Jackson 1982).
Various surveys at the Oak Hill Mine have resulted in the recording of at least 65
prehistoric and historic archaeological sites within a survey area which encompasses
more than 3,000 acres (Jones et al. 1987; Rogers et al. 1992). The prehistoric sites range
from the Paleo-Indian to Historic Caddoan times and consist mainly of lithic and ceramic
scatters although camp sites are present. One cemetery was recorded and avoidance was
recommended. Twelve archaeological sites were recommended for further testing for
eligibility for nomination to the NHRP, but only for (41RK214, 215, 222, 223) were
considered eligible for nomination (Rogers et al. 1994; Cliff et al. 2004; Cliff and Sills
2005). Almost all of the prehistoric sites recommended for testing were tied to perennial
water.
However, the Oak Hill Village (41RK214), which is on a ridge that overlooks Mill
Creek, was tested for it eligibility for nomination to the NHRP (Rogers and Perttula
2000). During the testing, 41 structures and 3 burials were uncovered. In addition,
numerous dart and arrow points were uncovered as were other lithic and ground stone
tools. About 8,230 pieces of lithic debitage and 23,660 ceramic sherds were found. The
site was occupied from the Paleo-Indian to the Middle Caddoan times. Three stages of
village development were noted prior to the site’s abandonment during the Middle
Caddoan period. Some of the recovered artifacts are on display at the Depot Museum in
Henderson.
Also discovered during the Oak Hill Mine survey was the Millville Mill site, 41RK223
(Foster and Glander 1993:76-80). The discovery and consequential investigation of the
site provided some insight not only in the construction of mills of the time, but lumbering
technology used in Rusk County.
Of special interest to the history of Texas was the Jim Hogg Birthplace who was a former
governor of Texas. The house foundation, a cellar, two wells and two fire places were
uncovered and mapped. Artifacts recovered included broken glass, bottles, porcelain
stone ware and ceramics, metal, ammunition cases, metal tools and nails. The site was
occupied probably from the early 1800s to the early 1900s (Jensen 1968).
A survey was conducted for the proposed Ponta Reservoir by Southern Methodist
University (Skinner 1971) which was to be constructed on the Angelina River in
Cherokee, Nacogdoches and Rusk Counties. Ten archaeological sites were recorded,
three of which were in Rusk County. Sites ranged in age from the Paleo-Indian to Late
Caddoan times. Site types included lithic scatters, lithic and pottery scatters and
village/camp sites, of which two contained human burials.

Of the eight sites recorded on the Minden, Texas 7.5’ USGS map, four (41RK59, 60, 61
and 62) are in the vicinity of the study area. Site 41RK57 is south of and across FM 2867
from the study area. All of the sites are historic kiln sites. No archaeological sites are
listed within or adjacent to the study area.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Two demographic research problems guided the field survey. The first focused on the
prehistoric utilization of the landfill site. Survey in the Troup Mine in southern Smith
County revealed that:
None of the prehistoric sites are located near the headwaters of the
tributaries [but] are located approximately two-thirds the way up their
respective watersheds (Skinner 1981:7-64).
This patterning is attributed to an absence of “sufficient” water upstream. If this is the
case within this part of the Sabine Watershed, then sites were unlikely to be found within
the study area.
The second research problem expected that historic sites would be found located close to
transportation routes. FM 2867 is present along the south edge of the landfill site;
therefore, there is the potential to encounter historic sites.
A third, and even more basic, research problem also guided the survey; simply stated the
questions asks “How did past people use the land, and what record of this use did they
leave behind? Most frequently, small-scale surveys of this type gather information in
response to this more open-minded research question, which guides almost all
archaeological surveys.
Since the landfill site is fenced, the boundaries of the survey were easily found. Transects
oriented north-south spaced 30 meters were used. Disturbed areas were intensively
inspected for surface artifacts and for evidence of buried cultural or soil horizons. Animal
burrows and fire ant mounds were common in some areas and provided a view of buried
sediments. Field roads and major and minor drainage gullies provided a wide variety of
subsurface exposures. Timbering, farming in the past, road construction and the
installation of monitoring wells and other disturbed areas were scattered throughout the
survey area. The suggested guideline of one shovel test per two acres as recommended by
the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002) was exceeded. Shovel tests were excavated to
approximately 30 cm below the ground surface or at least 5 cm into the subsoil. The
loamy matrices were screened through a 1/4-inch hardwire screen and the pit walls were
visually examined for cultural materials. Notes on the terrain, vegetation, soil types and
other relevant information were made and photographs were taken.
Backhoe trenching was not done due to the shallow depth to the subsoil which is listed as
ranging from 5 inches (13 cm) to 8 inches (20 cm) below the ground surface (Griffith
2000:127, 138)..

RESULTS
This portion of the report is divided into several parts. The study area is discussed first
and followed by a description of the archaeological survey. Conclusions derived from the
survey follow. Summaries of the shovel tests are presented in the text but specific
information is provided in Appendix A. Shovel test locations are shown on Figure 9.
The survey area
Three aerial photographs from 1939, 1949 and 1960 were examined that were made
available by Mr. Danny Jordan of the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the
Henderson office. In 1939, the north-south central portion of the study area was cleared,
and in 1949, grass and scattered trees appear to have grown in the cleared area. In the
1960 photograph, the study area appears to have been cleared completely. No residences
were seen on the aerial photographs. According to Mr. Jordan (personal communication),
it is likely the trees shown in the 1939 photograph were second growth because the land
had been cleared in the late 1800s for farming. Portions of the study area had been clear
cut recently based upon the size and spacing of saplings which are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3.

The survey area consisted of generally level to moderately steep terrain. Trees include
oak, pine, mulberry, hackberry, American elm, winged elm and crape myrtle. Understory
vegetation includes saw greenbriar, grape vine, prickly pear, bamboo, johnson grass and

other grass and bush species. Eye-height visibility ranged from poor (in the heavily
forested areas) to good (in the lightly forested areas). Ground visibility ranged from 0
percent to 100 percent (Figures 4 and 5).

Figure 4.

Typical ground visibility on top of the ridges. View is to the south.

Disturbances were present throughout the study area. Push piles (Figure 6) were abundant
in the southwest portion of the study area and a dirt two-track road (Figure 7) was present
along the boundaries of the landfill. Also, numerous short, dirt two-track roads (Figure 8)
ran throughout the study area. Some of the roads probably were associated with the
landfill, but some might have been logging roads.
The survey
Survey was conducted in two sections (Figure 9). The first section was the southeast
corner since it was separate. The second section is the west and northern portion. The
southeast corner was the least disturbed and nineteen shovel tests were excavated within
it. A first order intermittent drainage that is now shown on the USGS map is in this portio
of the study area. The drainage is approximately 2 m wide and a meter deep was present.
Water was flowing from ponded area to ponded area in a sandy clay substrate containing
hematite gravel. No buried cultural materials were seen in the bank walls. Sandy and
loamy clay subsoil was encountered on the surface in shovel tests (hereafter ST) 1, 3, 5, 7
and 14 and sandstone bedrock was on the ground surface in ST 13. The topsoil varied
from a sandy loam, loamy sand, sand and loam and ranged from 3 to 41 cm below the

ground surface. Subsoils ranged from sandy clay, sandy loam to mottled clay in the
shovel tests which were terminated from 28 to 51 cm below the ground surface.
Sandstone bedrock was encountered at 28 cm below the ground surface in STs 1 and 18
and laminated loamy sand was uncovered in ST 6 which was excavated by the drainage.
No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface and the shovel
tests were culturally sterile.
Forty-five shovel tests were excavated in the second section of the survey area. Of the
forty-five, seventeen encountered subsoil on the surface. Almost all of the subsoil was
uniform (yellowish-red) in color. Like the previous section, soil on tops of the ridges has
eroded off and is even shallow downslope. The depth to the subsoil is illustrated in Figure
10. The photograph was taken midway between the ridge top and bottom.

Figure 10.

Depth to subsoil between ridge top and bottom. The topsoil is probably
less than 25 cm thick. View is to the southwest.

The southern bank of the first order intermittent tributary to Dry Creek has been disturbed
and there is no floodplain present along the drainage until the northeastern portion of the
study area. The USGS map is misleading or else portions of the ridge have been removed
for fill. A floodplain that is about 30 m wide is present on both sides of the drainage. A
ridge overlooks the drainage and the land slopes at almost a ninety degree angle north of
the drainage. This locality was of special interest because site 41SM304 was recorded by
AR Consultants, Inc. (Skinner et al. 2004:27-32) during the survey of a landfill in Smith
County, Texas. The site consists of two artifact concentrations that cover approximately
3,650 square meters and the site overlooks Hankins Creek, a small perennial drainage,

which is a similar setting to the ridge discovered during the survey. No artifacts were
found on the ground surface but were uncovered during shovel testing of the site. Shovel
tests did not uncover any cultural materials and the sandstone bedrock was encountered at
18 cm below the ground surface in one shovel test (ST 57) and at 32 cm in another (ST
55). In addition, a dirt two-track road ran along the ridge top and no cultural materials
were seen in the road despite the good ground visibility and none were found in the
shovel tests. However, if a portion of the ridge had been removed, it is unlikely that
cultural materials older than 50 years would be present along the drainage because the
floodplain itself is young.
The intermittent tributary to Dry Creek is approximately 4 m wide and 2 m deep Figure
11). Water was flowing in a sandy clay substrate that contained hematite pea gravel. The
water was less than 0.25 m deep and no buried cultural materials were seen in the bank
walls.

Figure 11.

Mapped intermittent tributary to Dry Creek. View is to the west.

Shovel tests 52 and 59 through 64 uncovered loamy sand and sand that extended to 63 cm
below the ground surface, but failed to uncover any cultural materials. The water in the
drainage probably was from the recent rain.

Conclusions
To summarize the shovel testing, topsoil basically was absent along ridge tops and
shallow on the slopes. At the bottom of the ridges, the topsoil still was not extremely
deep, ca. 40 cm. No cultural materials were seen on the ground surface or uncovered in
64 shovel tests. The absence of historic sites probably is due to the fact that the land was
used for farming and logging practices. The absence of prehistoric sites is harder to
explain.
Assuming the ridge overlooking the tributary to Dry Creek has not been mined in part,
the absence of a prehistoric site comparable to 41SM304 probably is that Hankins Creek
is perennial whereas the tributary to Dry Creek is intermittent. The lack of prehistoric
sites for the rest of the study area may be due to the absence of perennial water or the
distance to perennial water.
Sites recorded during Martin Lake survey were recorded adjacent to the creek except for
one which was on the divide between Martin and Dry Creeks. However, prehistoric sites
recorded during the archaeological survey of the Oak Hill Mining area appear to have
been tied to perennial water whereas perennial water is absent in the study area.
It may be that farming and logging practices over the years have removed any cultural
deposits since the subsoil is so shallow (or non-existent) on the ridge tops and slopes.
Only occasionally was the topsoil greater than 15 cm below the ground surface along the
ridges. Although the depth to the subsoil was not given for the Oak Hill Village site, the
prehistoric sites investigated by Rogers et al. (1994) had at least 30 cm of soil along the
ridge. Both studies soils were similar to that of the study area, sandy loams overlying
sandy clay subsoils.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based upon the results of the intensive pedestrian archaeological survey, AR Consultants,
Inc. recommends that IESI TX Corporation be allowed to expand their landfill without
the need for further cultural resource investigations. We also recommend that if buried
cultural deposits are encountered during the expansion, work should immediately cease in
that area and the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
