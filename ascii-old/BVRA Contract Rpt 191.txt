ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a well and plant site in central Anderson
County, Texas was performed on November 4, 2007 by Brazos Valley Research
Associates (BVRA) for the Dogwood Springs Water Supply Corporation (WSC)
under Antiquities Permit 4709. The project area was investigated by shovel
testing. Due to extensive forest debris, a surface inspection was not possible.
The footprint for the well and plant site is 100’ x 100’ (.23 acre), and the entire
project area is on a six percent slope. Five shovel tests dug through sandy soil
to depths of 80 cm to 100 cm were negative in terms of producing cultural
materials, and no artifacts were collected. Therefore, it is recommended that
construction be allowed to proceed as planned. Copies of the report are on file
at the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Archeology Division, Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
The Dogwood Springs WSC plans to construct a well and plant site in the
Pineywoods Lake Resort Unit 1 on Lot 58 in the M. Fleming (A-295) and Nathan
Hendrichs (A-388) surveys in central Anderson County, Texas (Figure 1). The
existing system provides water service to properties in Pineywoods Lake
Resorts, Frankston properties, and properties in Lake Frankston. The system
currently serves 180 active water meters. Access to the area is provided by
State Highway 155 and several county roads. The Dogwood Springs WSC
currently consists of two existing wells and a distribution system that serves 180
customers. This project will meet the minimum requirements as established by
the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality (TCEQ) for the existing
customers and provide for moderate growth. There will be no permanent
structures located within flood zones or wetland areas. The existing plant to the
northwest will be demolished and replaced by the new well and plant site that will
have a greater capacity. The Dogwood Springs WSC will adopt binding
resolutions protecting the floodplains and wetland areas from future
development. The project area is depicted on the USGS topographic map Pert
(Figure 2).
Anderson County is located in a part of Texas that contains numerous
prehistoric and historic sites, many of which have been considered to possess
significant research potential. This county is in the area once inhabited by the
prehistoric Caddo Indians of Northeast Texas. Many of these sites contain
burials and pottery vessels of exceptional quality. Vandalism of archaeological
sites in this area is a serious problem, and the number of intact Caddoan sites is
rapidly decreasing. The THC has requested a cultural resources survey be
performed by a professional archaeologist prior to the construction of the well
and plant site. In order to comply with this request, the Dogwood Springs WSC
retained BVRA of Bryan, Texas to conduct this investigation. The project number
assigned by BVRA is 07-03.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain
physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1946) and the Austropriarian
biotic province as defined by Blair (1950:98-100). The reader is referred to
Volume I (Stratigraphy) of the Geology of Texas by Sellards et al. (1932) for a
more in-depth discussion of the geology of this area. Data taken from the Texas
Almanac for 1984-1985 (Kingston and Harris 1983) state that the county receives
40.51 inches of annual rainfall. When combined with a January minimum
temperature of 37 degrees Fahrenheit and a July maximum temperature of 94
degrees Fahrenheit, a growing season of 264 days results. Fauna known to be
present within the project area at various times of the year include fox and gray
squirrel, armadillo, raccoon, opossum, cottontail rabbits, white-tailed deer,
coyote, beaver, and feral hogs. Many birds utilize the site including dove,
meadowlark, killdeers, various sparrows, great blue herons, bluebirds,
mockingbirds, and cardinals.
The project area is located in an upland setting with elevations at or greater
than 500 feet above mean sea level. A large portion of the project area was heavily
wooded with mixed hardwoods, juniper, pines, and various kinds of understory
vegetation present such as vines and limited natural grasses (Figure 3). The
nearest water source is a tributary of Brushy Creek that has been dammed to
create Lake Frankston (680 meters to the Southwest) and Pineywoods Lake (765
meters to the Northwest).
According to the soil survey for Anderson County (Coffee 1975), the project
area is located within soils of the Darco Association. The soils in the project area
are described by Coffee (1975:Sheet 19) as Darco fine sand (DaD), 1 to 8 percent
slopes (Coffee 1975:12). This is a gently sloping to sloping soil that occurs on the
uplands in areas from ten acres to several hundred acres in size. A typical profile is
fine sand from the surface to 49 inches. Below that is a sandy clay loam from 49
inches to 67 inches. Sandy loam is present from 67 inches to 80 inches. Darco
soils are well drained to excessively drained. Permeability is moderately slow, and
the available water capacity is low. Runoff is slow. The project area soils are
depicted in Figure 4.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Anderson County is located in the Northeast Texas Archeological Study
Region of the Eastern Planning Region as defined by the Department of
Antiquities Protection in Archeology in the Eastern Planning Region, Texas: A
Planning Document (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). According to the planning
document, there were 121 sites recorded in the county as of 1991 (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993:41). In the region, Anderson County was 16th in terms of
numbers of sites recorded. Of the 121 recorded sites, 12 were considered not
significant, 41 were of unknown significance, 46 were probably significant, and
22 were significant. Two sites (41AN19 and 41AN51) are listed in the National
Register of Historic Places. Site 41AN51, the Pace McDonald site, has been
discussed in an unpublished manuscript by Thurmond (1978) on file at TARL. At
the time of this survey there were over 180 recorded prehistoric and historic sites
in the county.
The Archeological Bibliography for the Northeastern Region of Texas
(Martin 1990) cites 50 references for the county. Although many of these
investigations have been small area surveys, often resulting in negative findings,
several major reservoir projects have been conducted. These are the Blackburn
Crossing Reservoir (Johnson 1958, 1961), Palestine Reservoir (Anderson et al.
1974), Tennessee Colony Lake (Richner 1977; Richner and Lee 1976, 1977),
Trinity River Basin (Richner and Bagot 1978), and the Trinity River Multiple Use
Project (Sorrow 1973). Overviews of the area include works by (Lynott and
Richner 1977), Woodall (1972), and Story, et al. (1990). Prehistoric occupations
in the region cover all time periods from Paleoindian through Historic Caddoan,
circa 9500 B.C. - A.D. 1860 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:44). The reader is
referred to this comprehensive and well-organized document for additional
information regarding the archaeological background for Anderson County and
vicinity.
Numerous prehistoric sites have been recorded along Caddo Creek in
Anderson and Henderson counties and along Caney Branch in Anderson
County. Several of these sites were investigated in the 1930s under the direction
of A. M. Woolsey and A. T. Jackson of The University of Texas at Austin.
Although collections were sometimes curated, site forms and formal reports may
not exist. Most of these sites have been described as Caddoan, and some
contain burials with grave goods. According to the few site forms that are
present, the preferred location for sites appears to be terraces adjacent to
streams. Archaic hunting sites were recorded during the Lake Palestine survey
in 1960s and early 1970s (Anderson 1971). Sites found during this study were
predominantly associated with “streamside locations near relatively fertile soils”
(Anderson 1971:iii). The nearest recorded archaeological site to the project area
is 41AN42, approximately 574.12 meters to the northeast. Very little information
is available for this prehistoric site that is described on the site card as a “midden
mound.” No site form exists for this site.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field a records check for previously recorded sites in
or near the project area was conducted by Jean Hughes at TARL. Two important
reports were reviewed during the planning stages of this project. These are a
planning document by the Department of Antiquities Protection (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993) and an archeological bibliography for the Northeastern Region of
Texas (Martin 1990). The interested reader is referred to these sources for
additional information regarding the prehistory of this area.
The field investigation was conducted on November 4, 2007. The project
area was investigated through shovel testing. There was too much forest debris
to make a surface inspection possible except for obvious historic features. The
field crew consisted of the Principal Investigator and two assistants Randal
Anderson and Jennifer McMillan. The President of the Dogwood Springs WSC
(Jim Hallman) met us at the project area and showed us where the well is
proposed. We dug our first shovel test in this location to a depth of 100 cm
through sandy soil (Figure 4). The remaining four tests were dug to the
southeast, northeast, west, and southwest of the first test, and they were also
negative. The distance from the first shovel test at the well site (center hole) to
the remaining four tests was measured using a 50-meter metric tape, and the
orientation of the tests was determined using a Brunton compass. This
information was recorded on a shovel test log, which appears in this report as
Appendix I. The location of each test was plotted on a field map (Figure 5). This
project was also documented through field notes and a digital camera.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Literature Review
The records check at TARL revealed that no professional investigations
have been conducted in the project area. Most of the sites recorded in Anderson
County were probably located during the Lake Palestine survey (Anderson 1971)
and a survey of the Trinity River basin (Richner and Bagot 1978). Both
endeavors were conducted by Southern Methodist University. According to
Carolyn Spock (personal communication, June 10, 1994), there was a surge of
site recording for the county during 1979 (62 sites), 1980 (62 sites), and 1981 (79
sites). Most of these are believed to represent TARL numbers being assigned to
previously recorded sites by Southern Methodist University from the Lake
Palestine and Trinity River Basin projects. Today, there are more than 180 sites
in Anderson County.
Field Survey
Five shovel tests in the 2/3-acre project area were dug through sandy soil.
Four tests were terminated at 100 cm, and one test was terminated at 80 cm
when clay was encountered. No artifacts were found in any of the five tests,
which were dug randomly across the project area. Several pieces of sandstone
were recovered in Shovel Test 3, and three small fragments of unidentified
material were recovered in shovel tests 1 and 4. Analysis of these materials by
William A. Dickens revealed that they did not contain enough attributes for him to
identify them as cultural. According to Jim Hallman (personal communication), it
is unlikely that a house or other structure has ever stood in this area. He also
believes that, due to the slope of the tract, it has probably never been cultivated.
Although artifacts associated with prehistoric and historic sites can exist virtually
anywhere on the landscape, even on a slope, it is my opinion that the most likely
setting for a site is to the southeast at the top of the landform. At the time of this
visit, there was a residence in this location.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found during the survey of the proposed well
and plant site. It is, therefore, recommended that construction be allowed to
proceed as planned by the Dogwood Springs WSC without further consultation with
the THC. Should the construction plans change to include a greater area that can
be viewed as a likely setting for a prehistoric site, the THC must be notified in case
additional survey by a professional archaeologist is warranted. Also, if cultural
materials are unearthed during construction, all work in the area of the find must
stop until the situation can be evaluated by the THC. This study conformed to the
Minimum Survey Standards as defined by the Archaeology Division of the THC.
