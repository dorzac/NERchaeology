ABSTRACT
On July 31-August 3, and August 11, 2006, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted a cultural resource survey investigation of an approximately 1700 ft long section of
shoreline along Mud Lake in southeast Harris County, Texas. The objectives of the investigation
were to locate and identify cultural materials, sites, or historic properties within the proposed
impact area, and to prepare management recommendations regarding any identified resources.
The investigations were conducted for Berg Oliver Associates, Inc., under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4203.
An intensive pedestrian field survey of the project area was conducted, and included both
surface and subsurface (shovel test) examination. A total of 34 shovel tests were excavated. No
evidence of cultural materials was identified in the area of site 41HR86, which has been described
as “totally destroyed” prior to 1972 (Aten et al. 1976:1). The tests also documented the presence
of a zone of significant disturbance and modern fill located between STs 11-14 which resulted
from the demolition of the original Boys’ School facilities. The remaining shovel tests located
north of the archaeological zone described below documented undisturbed soils. None of these
tests encountered prehistoric or historic cultural materials, or any evidence of shell midden
formation. In the southern end of the project area, shovel tests and a backhoe trench identified
intact prehistoric cultural deposits in an area that extends north from the project’s southern
boundary for 35 meters along the shoreline, and up to 5-10 inland. Though separated by an
unsurveyed (outside the project property) area measuring approximately 30 meters in length, it
appears to be part of the previously identified SAL site, 41HR85. This newly identified northern
end of the site appears to consist of intact deposits, and based on the recovered materials and their
distribution, may contain both a high density and diversity of artifacts. The artifacts recovered
during the current investigations will be curated at TARL.
As a result of these investigations, Harris County reconfigured the bulkhead design so
that its southern end would not impact site 41HR85. Should any future developments be planned
for the area containing the site, it is recommended that additional investigations be undertaken in
order to determine site integrity and preservation of this northern portion of site 41HR85.
In the event that archeological deposits or features should be encountered during
construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission contacted for further consultation

INTRODUCTION
(ca. 518 by 9 m) area located on the east
bank of Mud Lake, a large inlet along the
north shore of Clear Lake. The project area
is located on property of the Harris County
Youth Village, a juvenile detention and
education center in Seabrook, Texas. The
project is in preparation for the construction
of an anti-erosion bulkhead.

On July 31-August 3, August 11,
2006, and January 3, 2007, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation of an
approximately 1700 ft long section of
shoreline along Mud Lake in southeast
Harris County, Texas. The objectives of the
investigation were to locate and identify
cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area,
and
to
prepare
management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 0659) were conducted for Berg Oliver
Associates, Inc. (Berg Job No. 6160), under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4203.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel
test
and
backhoe
trench)
examination (Figure 2; see Appendix 1 for
details). A total of 34 shovel tests and one
backhoe trench were excavated. The field
investigations were conducted by project
archeologist Randy Ferguson and field
technician Darren Ashby. Roger Moore
served as the project’s principal investigator.

The project area is depicted on the
League City Point, Texas 7.5' USGS
topographic quadrangle map (Figure 1). It
consists of an approximately 1700 ft by 30 ft

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Hydrology
The property is located along the
eastern shore of Mud Lake, which forms at
the confluence of Armand Bayou and Clear
Lake.

Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Flora and Fauna
Harris County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The county is
situated within the pine-oak subdivision of
the Austroriparian province (Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species
of the pine-oak forest subdivision as loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus
echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak
(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests
are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such
trees
as
sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia
grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water
oak (Quercus nigra), and other species of
oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly
diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandisia
usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).

The property is depicted on sheet
137 of the Soil Survey of Harris County,
Texas (Wheeler 1976). The single soil type
identified in the project area is Atasco fine
sandy loam, 0 to 4 percent slopes (AtB).
Atasco fine sandy loam is described as
moderately well drained with medium
surface runoff (Wheeler 1976:11). Based on
the PALM predictive model developed by
Abbott (2001), Atasco soils are upland
loamy ancient alluvium with a low potential
for containing deeply buried prehistoric
sites.

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus
borealis,
Sciurus
niger,
Sciurus
carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys
breviceps,
Reithrodonomys
fulvescens,
Peromyscus leucopus, Oryzomys palustris,
cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat
(Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail
(Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison)
may have been present on nearby grasslands

Climate
The modern climate of the Harris
County study area is moderated by winds
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights
(Wheeler
1976:2,
66).
Summer
temperatures average 92°F (33°C), while
winter temperatures average 64°F (18°C).
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches
(117 cm).

include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus

laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and
Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

at various times in the past (Gadus and
Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene
carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while
snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud
turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and
faunal resources. By remaining in familiar
territory, the nomadic populations were able
to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated Narváez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

Anglo-American settlement in the
Harris County area began in the early 1820s,
with a number of Mexican land grants
awarded in 1824 (Henson 1996). The
modern boundaries of the county were
established as Harrisburg County by the
Texas Congress in 1836, and it was renamed
Harris County in 1839. The presence of the
highly navigable Buffalo Bayou stimulated
economic development of the county, and of
the city of Houston in particular. The
establishment of six railroad lines in the area
prior to the Civil War further stimulated
economic prosperity, and helped lure a
steady stream of settlers to the region. By
the second decade of the 20th century, the

7

growing gas and oil industry was competing
with agricultural interests, and helped create

a significant boom in population.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Landmark (SAL) in 1981. Sites 41HR80
and 41HR85 are located just south of the
southern end of the project area, while
41HR87 is located approximately 200 m
beyond the northern end. The plotting for
the destroyed site, 41HR86, places it along
the eastern edge of the project’s southern
half.

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.

From a regional perspective, the
project is located in an area that contains a
number of significant stream systems,
including Armand Bayou, Horsepen Bayou,
Taylor Bayou, Clear Creek, Mud Lake, and
Clear Lake. Previous investigations along
many of these watersources have
documented a high density of prehistoric
occupation.

The archival background search
identified the presence of four sites in, or
adjacent to, the current project area. These
are the four “Harris County Boys’ School”
sites, 41HR80, 41HR85, 41HR86, and
41HR87. Two of these sites (41HR80,
41HR85) were first discovered and tested by
avocational archeologists in the late 1960s,
and then intensively investigated under
Texas Antiquities Committee permits during
1969-1972 (Aten et al. 1976).

The earliest work done in the area
was conducted by avocational archeologist
Wayne Neyland in the 1950s along the
banks of Clear Lake. Further investigations
followed in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
with surveys of Clear Creek, Armand
Bayou, and Mud Lake (Aten et al. 1976;
Corbin and Hester 1968; Fields and Jackson
1984; Fischer et al. 1984; Hole 1974;
McGruff and Cox 1973; Mercado-Allinger
et al. 1984). Although the site types have
included lithic scatters and a significant
Archaic cemetery (the Harris County Boys’
School sites), the vast majority of sites
appear to have been focused on the
exploitation of freshwater shellfish resources
and are located directly adjacent to the
active waterways.

The sites consisted of occupation,
Rangia shell midden, and human mortuary
deposits. The distribution of human remains
was limited primarily to the southern portion
of 41HR80, within shell midden refuse
(Aten et al. 1976:55). An approximate total
of 35 burials were recovered from the
cemetery.
Aten et al. (1976:1) reports that by
1972, construction had “largely destroyed”
41HR80 and 41HR85, and “totally
destroyed” 41HR86.
The remaining
(southern) portion of 41HR80 was
designated as a State Archeological

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
dumped in these areas. All but two of the
shovel tests appeared to reach ancient (preHolocene) subsoils (see Appendix 1); STs
12 and 13 were terminated prior to reaching
subsoil due to the presence of the dense
layer of modern debris. The remainder of
this initial transect of shovel tests, STs 3-10
and 15-21, documented the presence of
intact, natural sediments, but encountered no
additional cultural materials or evidence of
shell midden features.

The fieldwork was conducted on
July 31-August 3, August 11, 2006, and
January 3, 2007, and consisted of a 100%
pedestrian survey that included systematic
shovel testing, backhoe trenching, and visual
examination for surface exposure of cultural
materials.
The project area is depicted on the
League City Point, Texas 7.5' USGS
topographic quadrangle map (Figure 1). It
consists of an approximately 1700 ft by 30 ft
(ca. 518 by 9 m) area located on the east
bank of Mud Lake, a large inlet along the
north shore of Clear Lake. The project area
is located on property of the Harris County
Youth Village, a juvenile detention and
education center in Seabrook, Texas. The
project is in preparation for the construction
of an anti-erosion bulkhead.

Additional shovel tests were then
placed in three areas to further investigate
locations of potential cultural deposits. Two
tests, STs 27 and 28, were placed close to
ST 18 where Rangia shell fragments had
been noted on the ground surface. These
three tests determined the shell was part of a
thin (ca. 12-15 cm thick) layer of modern
sandy fill that was limited to a small area
along the shore, and thus did not represent
prehistoric cultural deposits. More tests,
STs 25 and 26, were placed near ST 3,
which was in the area nearest to the plotted
location of site 41HR86. This site was
reported destroyed by construction of new
county facilities (Aten et al. 1976:1). The
tests documented fill down to a depth of
approximately 20-22 cm; no evidence of the
site was identified.

Although the majority of the
facility’s grounds are cleared and wellmaintained, much of the narrow strip along
the water’s edge was covered in thick
natural vegetation. Within these thickly
wooded areas, the dominant vegetation
consisted of yaupon and oak trees, and a
dense understory of grasses and greenbriar.
A total of 34 shovel tests (ST) were
excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
screened through ¼” mesh (Figure 2;
Appendix 1). Each of the project’s shovel
tests were recorded and plotted on the
project map. The tests were placed at
approximately 30 m intervals on a single
transect along the shoreline of the property.

Site 41HR85
The SAL nominated site, 41HR85,
is a prehistoric occupation, shell midden,
and cemetery site. The previously
documented boundaries are based on limited
survey and extensive excavations conducted
in the late 1960s-early 1970s (Aten et al.
1976).
These site boundaries are
represented by a protective chain-link fence,
whose northern end is located 30-35 meters
south of the current project limits.

The initial transect was comprised
of STs 1-21. Prehistoric cultural materials
were recovered from STs 1 and 2, and are
clearly related to the nearby site 41HR85
(see below). Significant amounts of fill
containing dense construction debris were
documented by STs 11-14.
A local
informant told the field crew that much of
the debris and rubble from the demolished
original boys’ school buildings had been

The first two shovel tests, STs 1 and
2, placed in the southernmost portion of the
property area were positive for prehistoric
cultural materials (Figure 3, Table 2).
However, due to the light density of the

9

northern end of the site in order to
investigate the degree of site integrity and
preservation, and to aid in the determination
of approaches for future testing (Figure 4).
The trench was located just south of the
northernmost positive shovel test (ST 2).
The east-west oriented trench measured 3 m
in length, and was excavated to a total depth
of 75 cm.

materials, 1 flake in ST 1 and 1 sherd (in
disturbed matrix with modern debris) in ST
2, it was unclear whether these materials
represented a site, or if so, were part of
41HR85. In order to better identify the
deposits and define the site boundaries, an
additional nine shovel tests were placed in
the southern portion of the project area.
Of the 11 total tests, six contained
prehistoric cultural materials. The vertical
distribution of the materials extended from
10-40 cm below the modern ground surface.
In total, 66 artifacts were recovered. ST 33
produced the highest density of material,
and included 56 pieces of chert and silicified
wood debitage, and a silicified wood drill
fragment.
A broken denticulated chert
arrow point was recovered from ST 22
(Figure 7). ST 29 produced five ceramic
sherds.

The trench revealed that, other than
a thin 10-20 cm layer of modern fill most
likely related to previous demolition and
construction of facility buildings, this area
contained intact sediments, but did not
contain prehistoric cultural materials or
features
related
to
site
41HR85.
Consequently, the trench indicates that the
site does not extend further to the north, and
that the single sherd recovered from ST 2
represents material that is not associated
with intact site deposits.

On January 3, 2007, a backhoe
trench (BHT 1) was excavated near the

be intact prehistoric cultural deposits (STs 1,
22, 29, 31-34). The site area extends north
for the project boundary for 35 meters along
the shoreline, and up to 5-10 inland.
Though separated by an unsurveyed (outside
the project property) area measuring
approximately 30 meters in length, it
appears to be part of the previously
identified SAL site, 41HR85. This newly
identified northern end of the site appears to
consist of intact deposits, and based on the
recovered materials and their distribution,
may contain both a high density and
diversity of artifacts.
A backhoe trench
excavated on January 3, 2007, determined
that the intact deposits of the site did not
extend north of the trench location, and thus
indicates that the single sherd recovered
from ST 2 is not in an intact context.

On July 31-August 3, and August
11, 2006, Moore Archeological Consulting,
Inc., conducted a cultural resource survey
investigation of an approximately 1700 ft
long section of shoreline along Mud Lake in
southeast Harris County, Texas.
The
objectives of the investigation were to locate
and identify cultural materials, sites, or
historic properties within the proposed
impact area, and to prepare management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 0659) were conducted for Berg Oliver
Associates, Inc. (Berg Job No. 6160), under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4203.
An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination. A total of 34
closely spaced shovel tests were excavated.
No evidence of cultural materials was
identified in the area of site 41HR86, which
has been described as “totally destroyed”
prior to 1972 (Aten et al. 1976:1). The tests
also documented the presence of a zone of
significant disturbance and modern fill
located between STs 11-14 which resulted
from the demolition of the original Boys’
School facilities. The remaining shovel tests
located north of the archaeological zone
described below documented undisturbed
soils. None of these tests encountered
prehistoric or historic cultural materials, or
any evidence of shell midden formation.

As a result of these investigations,
Harris County reconfigured the bulkhead
design so that its southern end would not
impact site 41HR85. Should any future
developments be planned for the area
containing the site, it is recommended that
additional investigations be undertaken in
order to determine site integrity and
preservation of this northern end of site
41HR85.
In the event that archeological
deposits or features should be encountered
during construction, work should cease in
the immediate vicinity and the Archeology
Division
of
the
Texas
Historical
Commission
contacted
for
further
consultation.

In the southern end of the project
area, shovel tests identified what appeared to
