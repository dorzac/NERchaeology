ABSTRACT
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, performed an intensive pedestrian cultural
resources survey on an estimated 324 hectares (800 acres) of property owned by GGP
Bridgeland L.P. in northwest Harris County, Texas. Expansion of the current Bridgeland
residential development is proposed for the Permit Area/Area of Potential Effect. The Lead
Federal Agency for this project has been identified as the Galveston District of the United
States Army Corps of Engineers.
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if project construction would
affect any previously identified historic properties and to establish whether or not previously
unidentified cultural resources were located within the United States Army Corps of
Engineers’ Permit Area, also defined as the project’s Area of Potential Effect. No Texas
Antiquities Permit was required as all survey work was completed on privately owned
property. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state (the
Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal (National Historic Preservation Act) guidelines.
The Permit Area/Area of Potential Effect is defined as approximately 324 hectares (800 acres)
proposed for residential development. Field investigation consisted of both visual inspection
and subsurface shovel testing across the entire Permit Area/Area of Potential Effect.
Subsurface investigation resulted in the excavation of 545 shovel tests, or approximately 1
shovel test per 1.5 acre. Field survey required approximately 780 person hours to complete.
Portions of the Permit Area/Area of Potential Effect have been disturbed by previous land
modification including farm pond excavation, creation of berms and gravel roads, well
drilling, land leveling, and other agricultural activities.
As a result of this investigation, 2 prehistoric cultural resources were located within the Permit
Area/Area of Potential Effect. Two lithic flakes were encountered during shovel testing in the
southwestern corner of the Permit Area/Area of Potential Effect. These were assigned new
trinomial 41HR1084. A single lithic flake was found during shovel testing in the central
portion of the Permit Area/Area of Potential Effect. Following boundary delineation, this locus
was determined to be isolated and was therefore labeled Isolate #1. A state site trinomial was
not sought for Isolate #1. Both Site 41HR1084 and Isolate #1 are determined not eligible for
the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D, since the finds lack information
potential or research value. HRA Gray & Pape, LLC recommends that no further cultural
resources work be required and that the project be cleared to proceed as currently planned.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
In August of 2010, Berg-Oliver Associates, Inc., of Houston, Texas contracted with HRA
Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), of Houston, Texas, to perform an intensive
pedestrian cultural resources survey on an estimated 324 hectares (800 acres) of property
controlled by GGP Bridgeland L.P. and proposed for development as an extension of an
existing residential community in Harris County, Texas. The Lead Federal Agency for this
project has been identified as United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Galveston
District.
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if project construction would
affect any previously identified historic properties and to establish whether or not previously
unidentified cultural resources were located within the USACE Permit Area also defined as
the project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE). No Texas Antiquities Permit was required as all
survey work was completed on privately owned property. All fieldwork and reporting
activities were completed with reference to state (the Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal
(National Historic Preservation Act [NHPA]) guidelines.

1.1

Permit Area/APE Description

The USACE Permit Area/APE is primarily used for cattle pasture and also contains various
gas and water wells. In the past, the area was used for rice production and ranching. The
Permit Area/APE is located on the Cypress (2995-343) 7.5-minute United States Geological
Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle map. The Permit Area/APE is defined as 324 hectares
(800 acres) proposed for development and is located between Fry Road and House Hahl Road,
south of Cypress Creek and the existing Bridgeland subdivisions, in northwest Harris County,
Texas (Figure 1). The anticipated depth of the Permit Area/APE is below 1 meter (3 feet),
although Holocene deposits in the area are shallow.

2.0 NATURAL SETTING
The Permit Area/APE is situated in the South Texas Coastal Plains physiographic zone
(Perttula 2004: Figure 1.2). The Texas Coastal Plains make up part of the larger Gulf Coastal
Plain, a low, level to gently sloping region extending from Florida to Mexico (Perttula 2004;
Abbott 2001).
The basic geomorphological characteristics of Harris County resulted from the combined
action of sea level changes from glacial advance in the northern portions of the continent, and
subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load capacity of the region’s rivers. In
general, Harris County is underlain by relatively recent sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated
sediments ranging in age from the Miocene to Holocene. The Lissie Formation, which
underlies the Permit Area/APE, is of Pleistocene age and predates human occupation (Abbott
2001; Barnes 1992; Van Siclen 1991).

2.1

Soils

The Permit Area/APE is located within an area composed primarily of Gessner loam, Katy
fine sandy loam, Ari fine sandy loam, Aris-Gessner complex, Clodine loam, and Addicks
loam Information about the soil series is detailed below based on the official descriptions
provided by the Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resource Conservation Service, United States
Department of Agriculture (SSS NRCS USDA) (2010).
Gessner loam is a poorly drained soil found on depressions on coastal plains (SSS NRCS
USDA 2010). Gessner loam is usually saturated with water at the ground surface in all but the
months of July and August. A typical soil profile consists of grayish brown fine sandy loam to
a depth of 64 centimeters (25 inches) followed by dark grayish brown sandy clay loam to a
depth of 1.2 meters (49 inches). Below these layers lies a light gray sandy clay loam to a depth
of 2.3 meters (91 inches). Gessner series soil has low to moderate geoarcheological potential
(Abbott 2001).
Katy fine sandy loam is a moderately well drained soil found on flats on coastal plains (SSS
NRCS USDA 2010). A typical soil profile consists of 30 centimeters (12 inches) of dark
grayish brown fine sandy loam followed by 33 centimeters (13 inches) of pale brown fine
sandy loam. These layers are underlain by 8 centimeters (3 inches) of yellowish brown loam to
a depth of 71 centimeters (28 inches). The final layer is a mottled yellowish brown, red, and
gray loam to a depth of 2 meters (84 inches). Katy series soil has low geoarcheological
potential (Abbott 2001).
Aris fine sandy loam is a poorly drained soil also found on flats on the coastal plain (SSS
NRCS USDA 2010). A typical soil profile consists of 15 centimeters (6 inches) of dark
grayish brown silt loam followed by 20 centimeters (8 inches) of light brownish gray silty clay
loam. These layers are underlain by dark gray silty clay to a depth of 58 centimeters (23
inches). Finally a layer of clay is found grading in color from gray to light gray with yellowish
4

brown mottles to a depth of 2 meters (80 inches). Aris series soil has low geoarcheological
potential (Abbott 2001).
The composition of the Aris- Gessner complex (Ar) includes 30- 50% Aris soil, 20- 30%
Gessner soil, and 20- 30% of other soils. The surface layer of Aris Soil reaches a depth of 18
centimeters (7 inches) and is friable, neutral, dark grayish brown fine sandy loam. The layer
below that is firm, medium acid, gray sandy clay loam that extends to a depth of 71
centimeters (28 inches). Below that is very firm, strongly acid, dark gray clay mottled with red
and strong brown and reaches a depth of 117 centimeters (46 inches). The next layer extends
to a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches). This layer is very firm, medium acid, gray clay that
grades to a very firm, slightly acid, light gray clay loam (Wheeler 1976). The Gessner soil has
a surface layer about 18 centimeters (7 inches) thick of friable, slightly acid, dark grayish
brown loam. The next layer extends to a depth of about 23 centimeters (9 inches). This layer is
friable, slightly acid, grayish brown loam and tongues into the following layer. This layer is 86
centimeters (34 inches) thick, friable, neutral, dark gray loam that is slightly more clayey.
Below that, extending to a depth of about 48 centimeters (19 inches) is a layer of friable,
moderately alkaline, light brownish gray loam. The final layer consists of firm, moderately
alkaline, light gray sandy clay loam having distinct mottles of brownish yellow and yellowish
brown that extends to a depth of 213 centimeters (84 inches) (Wheeler 1976).
Clodine loam is a poorly drained soil found on flats on the coastal plain (SSS NRCS USDA
2010). A typical soil profile consists of 25 centimeters (10 inches) of dark gray loam followed
by 64 centimeters (25 inches) of gray loam. These layers are followed by light gray loam to a
depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches) and light brownish gray loam to a depth of 2.1 meters (85
inches). Below these lies a final layer of light brownish gray clay loam to a depth of 2.7 meters
(105 inches). Clodine series soil has low to moderate geoarcheological potential (Abbott
2001).
Addicks loam is a poorly drained soil found on flats on the coastal plain (SSS NRCS USDA
2010). A typical soil profile consists of 28 centimeters (11 inches) of black loam followed by
30 centimeters (12 inches) of dark gray loam. These layers are underlain by light gray loam
with yellow mottles to a depth of 2 meters (78 inches). According to Abbott (2001:22),
Addicks series soil has a low geoarcheological potential or “likelihood that the soil could
contain buried cultural material in reasonable context.”

2.2

Flora and Fauna

Present-day Harris County is located near the western edge of the Austroriparian biotic
province, and is situated in the Upland Prairies and Woods subregion of the Gulf Coast
Prairies and Marshes Region (Abbott 2001). Climactic fluctuation during the Holocene would
eventually result in a gradual trend towards warmer weather, similar to that seen today (Abbott
2001).
Late Pleistocene flora may have included populations of spruce, poplar, maple, and pine
(Holloway 1997), in an oak woodland environment that would eventually transition to an oak
savanna in the late Holocene (Abbott 2001). Fauna during this time would include
5

currently present species such as white-tailed deer and various smaller game, as well as bison,
and, in localized areas, pronghorn sheep and the American alligator (Abbott 2001). Modern
land alteration activities have resulted in the removal of native plant and animal species from
the area (Abbott 2001).

3.0 CULTURAL SETTING
Researchers have used changes in projectile point technologies and the introduction of pottery
into the Southeast Texas region to subdivide the southeast Texas Prehistoric period into 6
archeological time periods. In general, these include the Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early,
Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic Indian.
However, while these archaeologists agree on the general framework of cultural time periods
within the region, there is some disagreement on the temporal boundaries of these periods.
For example, Patterson’s (1996) chronology includes Early Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.),
Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (3000­
1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D. 100-A.D. 600), Late
Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the Historic Indian (A.D.
1700-1800) periods. In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a Southeast Texas chronology that
includes Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8000-5000 B.C.), Middle Archaic
(5000-1000 B.C.), Late Archaic (1000 B.C.-A.D. 400), Early Ceramic (A.D. 400-A.D. 800),
and Late Ceramic (A.D. 800-A.D. 1750). Perttula’s (2004: Table 1.1) and Ricklis (2004:
Figure 6.1.1) provide a recent chronology for the Upper Texas Coast is also applicable to the
Permit Area/APE and includes Early Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000­
6000 B.C.), Early Archaic (6000-4000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (4000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic
(1500-200 B.C.); Tchula (200-0 B.C.), Early Ceramic (A.D. 0-700), Initial Late Prehistoric
(A.D. 700-1250), Final Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1250-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700),
and the Early Historic (A.D. 1700-1800) periods.
Within this chronological context, the oldest prehistoric sites in Harris County can be found
around Clear Lake, and date to approximately 4000 B.C. placing them in the latter part of the
Early Archaic (Henson 2005). Unfortunately, it has proven difficult to date many sites in the
county. Those near the coast are shell middens, which are difficult to radiocarbon date
accurately and are largely Late Prehistoric in age (Ricklis 2004:201-202). In addition,
numerous shell middens were destroyed by nineteenth century quarrying of shell for use in
construction (Henson 2005). The evidence of inland human occupation is just as fragmentary,
particularly in the uplands where archaeological data are derived largely from multicomponent
sites with mixed deposits, rather than stratified sites associated with river valleys draining the
county (Abbott 2001; Ricklis 2004:201-202).
Historically, Harris County was formed as Harrisburg County on December 22, 1836. The
county was renamed Harris in December 1839 to honor John Richardson Harris, an early
pioneer who had established Harrisburgh in 1826, the first town site in the county. The area
surrounding Harrisburg (as it came to be spelled by 1832) was known as the San Jacinto
District. The district stretched east from Lynchburg on the San Jacinto River west to the
location of present day Richmond and from Clear Creek in the south to Spring Creek in the
north. Harrisburg County encompassed this same territory with the addition of Galveston
Island. The modern boundaries of Harris County were established in 1838 (Henson 2005).

3.1

Brief History of Historic Land Use and Ownership

Early settlers and land grantees in southeast Texas often chose parcels directly on creeks and
bayous. The Permit Area/APE, some 2.4 kilometers (1.5 miles) south of Cypress Creek, was
unsettled in the late nineteenth century and was part of a larger portion of land that was issued
in (259-hectare) 640-acre sections to the Houston and Texas Central (H&TC) railroad as an
incentive for construction. The railway, along the present day course of Highway 290, was
chartered in 1848 and the line between Houston and Cypress was completed in 1856. The
large cattle ranchers certainly ranged their cattle on the unfenced H&TC railroad land and
used the railroad to transport their cattle to market (Moss 2007).
The 324-hectares (800-acre) USACE Permit Area/APE was once part of the larger
landholdings of John C. Anderson. Anderson bought up several thousand acres within the
H&TC Railroad survey, beginning in 1902. The lands were known as the John C. Anderson
Ranch, though in the 1920s and 30s the Anderson family was residing in Carlinville, Illinois.
A 1915 USGS topographic map of the area shows no structures within the Permit Area/APE
and a landscape of shallow, scattered depressions.
In 1939, probate documents show the ranch ‘together with all improvements thereon’ being
sold by one of Anderson’s sons and another executor to Lenoir M. Josey. The sale included
some 2702 hectares (6678 acres), and mentioned that the land was at that time leased out to a
W. A. Paddock for cattle grazing.
By 1952, aerial photographs of the Permit Area/APE show fewer depressions and the first dirt
roads, perhaps evidence of landscaping for agriculture. In 1961, after Lenoir Josey’s death, the
deed to John C. Anderson Ranch was turned over to Emmet McGauly, Trustee, of Harris
County. The deed transfer included a “Rice Drier” and 4 water well motors and pumps located
on the ranch property, though not necessarily located on the current 324 hectares (800-acre)
parcel.
USGS aerial photographs and topographic maps show the drainage canals in their current
positions by 1968 and the first large oil or water storage tanks by 1970. The detention ponds in
Sections B and C appear between 1995 and 2009, along with the residential developments to
the east and north.
The land manager, Monte Bagwell (personal communication 2010) confirmed that the entire
Permit Area/APE had been used for rice cultivation in the past as well as for cattle pasture. In
this region, it became common to rotate fields between rice production and cattle grazing
(Moss 2007).

4.0 PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, an online resource maintained by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), indicates that 8 previous investigations have been conducted within 1.6
kilometers (1 mile) of the Permit Area/APE (see Figure 1). No historic markers, cemeteries, or
National Register properties have been identified within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the Permit
Area/APE. Two archaeological sites are located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the Permit
Area/APE.
Sites 41HR402 and 41HR403 were recorded in 1978 by Martha Doty Freeman, likely during a
survey around Cypress Creek for the Galveston District of the USACE. Both are nineteenth
and twentieth century house sites that had been extensively disturbed or destroyed by the
effects of rice cultivation and oil well construction. They lie approximately 1.2 kilometers
(0.75 miles) northeast of the Permit Area/APE and south of Cypress Creek. The sites’
eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Properties (NRHP) or as a State
Archaeological Landmark (SAL) is unknown.
Eight previously conducted cultural resources investigations are found within 1.6 kilometers
(1 mile) of the Permit Area/APE. In 1978, 4 surveys were performed in the surrounding area
for the Galveston District of the USACE. No further information was available regarding these
block area surveys. In 2003, MAC, Inc. conducted a survey northeast of the Permit Area/APE
on a small area proposed for a drainage outfall structure on Cypress Creek. It appears that no
cultural resources were recorded as a result of the survey (Donachie 2004).
In 2004, HRA Gray and Pape performed a survey west of the Permit Area/APE on behalf of
the Galveston District of the USACE and Harris County Public Infrastructure Department. No
cultural resources were recorded as a result of this 44-hectare (109-acre) survey (Hughey
2004).
In 2009, PBS&J performed a survey west of the Permit Area/APE sponsored by Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and Harris County Toll Road Authority. No cultural
resources were identified as a result of this 112 hectare (278 acre) survey (Schubert et al.
2010). In 2009, PBS&J performed a second larger survey west of the Permit Area/APE on
behalf of TxDOT. No cultural resources were identified as a result of this 139-hectare (344­
acre) survey (Schubert et al. 2009).

METHODOLOGY
Site File and Literature Review

Background and site file research was initiated prior to fieldwork mobilization. The
background literature search included a review of both archeological site files and
architectural resource files, and a review of previously conducted cultural resource surveys in
the vicinity. This information was obtained by reviewing records via the online Texas
Archeological and Historic Sites and Atlases, maintained by the THC. HRA Gray & Pape
attempted to document previously identified resources located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile)
radius of the Permit Area/APE. Soil survey maps of the Permit Area/APE were also examined
in an attempt to identify the soils that underlie the Permit Area/APE. In addition, a review of
aerial imagery and historic topographic maps was also conducted. Archival records research
was carried out at the Harris County Clerk’s Office and Houston Public Libraries.

5.2

Field Survey Methods

Survey activities were designed to assess the potential impact that proposed construction
might have on intact and significant cultural resources located within the Permit Area/APE.
The Permit Area/APE was arbitrarily divided into 5 block sections (Sections A-E) along
gravel roads running through the 324-hectare (800-acre) parcel for ease of field survey and
recording. Sections A through E were subjected to intensive pedestrian survey including visual
surface reconnaissance and shovel testing.
There was little to no ground surface visibility in the pasture so visual surface reconnaissance
was supplemented with shovel testing in all sections to identify artifacts, features, and
evidence of historic structures appearing 50 years in age or older. Land modifications
including well construction, multiple farm pond excavations, and gravel road and ditch
placement indicated that these portions of the project did not warrant subsurface testing.
Therefore, shovel tests were not placed where the natural landscape appeared significantly
disturbed or where the ground was inundated with long-standing water containing vegetation
characteristic of wetlands.
In general the Permit Area/APE was considered to have a low to moderate potential for
containing intact significant sites based on previous agricultural disturbances of the Permit
Area/APE, the presence of soils characterized as ancient loamy alluvium with low potential
for containing intact archeological deposits (Abbott 2001), and a relatively far distance from
natural perennial waterways. Each block section of the Permit Area/APE was surveyed along
transects spaced 60 meters (200 feet) apart. Shovel testing was intensified in the southern half
of the Permit Area/APE, within Sections A-C. Shovel tests in these sections were typically
excavated along transects spaced 30 meters (100 feet) apart at 120-meter (383-foot) staggered
intervals where some alluvium from Cypress Creek was present.
Subsurface testing consisted of the excavations of 30x30-centimeter (12x12-inch) shovel tests
10

along transects within the Permit Area/APE. Vertical control was maintained by excavating
each shovel test in 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels. One wall of each shovel test was profiled and
the walls and floor of each shovel test were inspected for color or texture change potentially
associated with the presence of cultural features. When possible, soils were screened through
0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) wire mesh; soils with high clay content were hand-sorted in an
effort to detect cultural materials in the soil matrix. All shovel tests were backfilled after
excavations and documentations of them were completed. No artifacts or cultural features
were collected.
When buried resources were located, an attempt was made to define their boundaries.
Additional delineation shovel tests were excavated in 4 radiating directions at an interval of 15
meters (50 feet) within the confines of the Permit Area/APE. In general, 2 sterile shovel tests
were used to define a site’s size and location. At a minimum, between 6 and 8 delineation
shovel tests were excavated unless surrounding landforms or topography suggested the
presence of a natural site boundary.
When historic standing structures within or immediately adjacent to the Permit Area/APE
were located, each was photographed during the survey and their locations plotted on field
maps with Global Positioning System (GPS) points collected. General characteristics of each
resource were documented on standardized forms.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
6.1

Results of Site File and Literature Review

Background research using the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas indicated that that no
previously recorded archeological sites are located within the Permit Area/APE, though 2 sites
are found within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the Permit Area/APE. No historic markers,
cemeteries, or other cultural resources are located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the
Permit Area/APE. Background research also indicates that 8 previously conducted cultural
resources investigations have been conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the
Permit Area/APE. These investigations were discussed in Chapter 4.0.

6.2

Results of Field Investigations

The primary purpose of field investigations was to determine whether or not any previously
unidentified, intact, and significant cultural resources were present within the Permit
Area/APE and to provide management recommendations based on research and survey
activities. A combined total of 545 shovel tests were excavated within all 5 sections of the
Permit Area/APE where previous subsurface disturbances were not apparent (Figure 2).
Observed soils were generally similar to those mapped for the area, composed of loamy
ancient alluvium. Figure 3 displays typical soil profiles found in each section of the Permit
Area/APE.
Field survey of Section A and B did result in the discovery of 2 finds of prehistoric age (a
small site and an isolated artifact). Details surrounding the discovery and delineation of these
finds are presented in parts 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 below.
6.2.1

Results within Section A

A total of 112 shovel tests were excavated in Section A along 19 pedestrian transects (Figure
2). All shovel tests on this tract were excavated to culturally sterile soil horizons encountered
at depths between 45 and 75 centimeters (18 and 30 inches) below the surface. A typical soil
recorded within Section A was composed of dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) sandy loam from
the surface to a depth of 15 centimeters (6 inches) and followed by yellowish brown
(10YR5/4) sandy loam to a depth of 65 centimeters (26 inches) and mottled brown and
yellowish brown (10YR4/3 and 10YR5/8) sandy clay to terminal depth of 80 centimeters (31
inches). In general, the soil profiles in this section resembled the Gessner series soils which
are mapped for the area, though with no distinction between the A and B horizons in places.
Disturbances observed within Section A included previous canal and berm construction along
the southern boundary, an overhead power line in the southwest, a gravel road and oil storage
tanks along the western side of the section, and a large dirt spoil pile and well-monitoring
equipment in the north.
The only evidence of cultural material found during shovel testing were 2 chert flakes located

in separate shovel tests in the southwestern corner of Section A, each approximately 50
centimeters (20 inches) below the ground surface (Figure 2). Once the excavation of a shovel
test resulted in the positive identification of an artifact, an effort was made to clearly delineate
the boundaries of the resource. Delineation was accomplished by excavating shovel tests at a
15-meter (50-foot) interval in each cardinal direction from the initial location of the subsurface
artifact. A total of 2 chert flakes were encountered, 30 meters (200 feet) apart, upon
delineation of the site boundaries (Figure 4). The disturbance of the ground surface along the
southern edge of the Permit Area/APE from drainage canal and berm construction precluded
shovel testing to the south. This small prehistoric lithic scatter was assigned a state trinomial
41HR1084. No culturally or temporally diagnostic material was recovered. The limited
research potential of this site was exhausted during delineation and the site lacks information
potential or research value based on the non-diagnostic and ordinary nature of the artifacts as
well as the lack of associated artifacts and features.
6.2.2

Results within Section B

A total of 138 shovel tests were excavated in Section B along 23 pedestrian transects (see
Figure 2). All shovel tests on this tract were excavated to culturally sterile soil horizons
encountered at depths between 45 and 85 centimeters (18 and 33 inches) below the surface. A
typical soil recorded within Section B was composed of dark brown (10YR3/3) sandy loam
from the surface to a depth of 15 centimeters (6 inches) and followed by light yellowish brown
(10YR6/4) sand to a depth of 50 centimeters (20 inches) and mottled brown and yellowish
brown (10YR5/3 and 10YR5/8) compact sandy clay to terminal depth of 65 centimeters (26
inches). Disturbances observed within Section B included drainage ditch, berm, gravel road
and oil storage tanks along the center of the section. Two large detention ponds prevented
several planned shovel tests in the northern part of Section B.
The only evidence of cultural material found during shovel testing was an isolated chert flake
referred to as Isolate #1, located in a shovel test in the middle of Section B, approximately 20
centimeters (8 inches) below ground surface. The same delineation procedure, as outlined
above, was used. All radial shovel tests were negative for archaeological materials or features.
Because Isolate #1 was not associated with any other material an official site declaration was
not made. Isolate #1 was recorded in a shallow isolated context and lacks information
potential or research value based on its ordinary and non-diagnostic nature.
6.2.3

Results within Section C

A total of 125 shovel tests were excavated in Section C along 12 pedestrian transects (see
Figure 2). All shovel tests on this tract were excavated to culturally sterile soil horizons
encountered at depths between 50 and 100 centimeters (20 and 40 inches) below the surface.
A typical soil recorded within Section C was composed of brown (10YR4/3) sandy loam from
the surface to a depth of 50 centimeters (20 inches) followed by yellowish brown (10YR5/4)
sandy loam to a depth of 65 centimeters (26 inches) and mottled yellowish brown and strong
brown (10YR5/4 and 7.5YR5/8) clay to terminal depth of 80 centimeters (31 inches).
Disturbances observed within Section C include a gravel road along the northern boundary, a

dirt road running through the middle part of the section, a large retaining pond in the northern
part, and water and gas wells in the eastern and western parts of Section C. All shovel tests
were negative for cultural resources.
A derelict piece of heavy machinery has been abandoned in Section C of the Permit Area/APE
(see Figure 2; Figure 5). Bearing a metal plate identifying it as a Marvin Landplane, the
equipment appears to have been used for grading and leveling soil. It presumably was used on
the property during the period that rice cultivation took place here.
A portion of the property is enclosed by a deteriorated post and rail fence also located in
Section C (see Figure 2; Figure 5). Largely obscured by trees, brush, and other vegetation, the
fence appears to have functioned as a corral for livestock. Constructed of sawn dimensional
lumber with a wire mesh overlay, the fence’s materials, appearance, and condition suggest it
was built within the past 50 years.
6.2.4

Results within Section D

A total of 114 shovel tests were excavated in Section D along 16 pedestrian transects (see
Figure 2). All shovel tests on this tract were excavated to culturally sterile soil horizons
encountered at depths between 50 and 100 centimeters (20 and 40 inches) below the surface.
A typical soil recorded within Section D was composed of very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2)
sandy loam from the surface to a depth of 10 centimeters (4 inches) and followed by dark
grayish brown (10YR4/2) sandy clay loam to a depth of 40 centimeters (16 inches) and
grayish brown (10YR5/2) clay loam to terminal depth of 70 centimeters (28 inches).
Disturbances observed within Section D included a gravel road along the northern, eastern,
and southern boundary, an oil/water well in the northern part, an oil pad in the southeast part,
drainage ditches/berms running north to south through the middle of the section and running
the entire length of the southern boundary. All shovel tests were negative for cultural
resources.
6.2.5

Results within Section E

A total of 56 shovel tests were excavated in Section E along 8 pedestrian transects (see Figure
2). All shovel tests on this tract were excavated to culturally sterile soil horizons encountered
at depths between 50 and 65 centimeters (20 and 26 inches) below the surface. A typical soil
recorded within Section E was composed of very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) sandy loam
from the surface to a depth of 50 centimeters (20 inches) and followed by grayish brown
(10YR5/2) clay loam to terminal depth of 80 centimeters (31 inches). Disturbances observed
within Section E included a pond in the northwest corner boundary, a drainage ditch running
along the eastern boundary and through the middle of Section E, a gravel road along the
eastern boundary, and an oil well pad on the southeast and north parts of the section. All
shovel tests were negative for cultural resources.

7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report summarizes the results of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey on an
estimated 324 hectares (800 acres) of property owned by GGP Bridgeland L.P. in northwest
Harris County, Texas. Expansion of the Bridgeland residential development is proposed for
the Permit Area/APE. The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if project
construction would affect any previously identified historic properties and to establish whether
or not previously unidentified cultural resources were located within the USACE Permit
Area/APE.
Prior to fieldwork mobilization, a background literature and site file search was conducted to
identify the presence of recorded sites within or near the Permit Area/APE. The search
indicated that 2 previously identified archeological sites have been recorded within a 1.6­
kilometer (1-mile) radius. Prior to survey, no previously known sites, histories markers,
recorded cemeteries were known to be located within the Permit Area/APE.
Field investigation consisted of visual inspection and systematic shovel testing along parallel
pedestrian survey transects running north to south within 5 arbitrary sections, labeled Sections
A, B, C, D, and E within the Permit Area/APE. A total of 545 shovel tests were excavated
within the Permit Area/APE, averaging 0.68 shovel test per acre. Major disturbances recorded
include drainage ditches, oil and water wells, retaining ponds, roads, and berms. The soils
encountered in the majority of shovel tests showed evidence of recent plowing resulting in
near-surface disturbances.
As a result, 1 new prehistoric archaeological site (41HR1084), composed of 2 chert flakes, and
1 new isolated chert flake (Isolate #1) were located within the Permit Area/APE. Both loci are
recommended not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP under Criterion D, as both loci offer no
research value and have no potential to add significant knowledge to the archaeological record
of the region based on the paucity and lack of diagnostic materials associated with each.
No architectural resources associated with this property’s historic agricultural use are extant.
Field and archival research yielded no evidence to indicate that the Permit Area/APE is
associated with historically significant events, trends or patterns of development, or important
individuals. As a result, it is recommended not eligible for the NRHP under Criteria A and B.
The only extant above-ground resource is a corral fence of undistinguished design,
workmanship, and materials. Field investigations provided no evidence that the property is
significant for its architectural or engineering characteristics. It is not recommended eligible
for the NRHP under Criterion C. Furthermore, the property lacks integrity of design, setting,
workmanship, materials, feeling, and association, and does not convey a sense of historic time
and place.
Based on the results of the survey conducted for this project, HRA Gray & Pape recommends
that no further cultural resources work be required, and that the project be cleared to proceed
as planned.
