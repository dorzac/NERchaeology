WELmME!

This field trip will provide an opportunity for you to become acquainted
with the deltaic coastal plain of late pleistocene age, and to compare some
of its features with those of the Recent deltaic plain of the Brazos River.
The late Pleistocene deposits tend to be neglected in favor of seemingly
more practical studies of younger sediments along the coast, and of older
Tertiary beds farther inland. However, the intervening Pleistocene is an
essential lInk between these, and demonstrates rather clearly some of the
features found in ancient deltaic deposits. The field trip is thus a
logical extension of the papers presented by the Delta Study Group of the
Houston Geological Society at the final session of the GCAGS Annual Meeting
on Friday afternoon.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
A number of individuals and their companies have made essential
contributions to the hope-for success of this field trip. Edgar Tobin
Aerial Surveys provided two airphoto mosaics, plates II E and II W, and
printed the copies for this guidebook without cost. plate III Airphoto
Terrain Investigation is based on an exercise by the 1963 Airphoto Geology
class at the University of Houston, under the supervision of Adam N. Thomas.
Texaco Inc. and Robert A. We1cn FounOatLon granted permission to
visit the segment of Live Oak beach ridge near Hoskins Mound, and Mr. Robert
N. Mize of Texaco Inc. serves as our guide on the property. Mr. Talmadge
P. Gunnels of Freeport kindly gave permission to inspect the pit of the
Gunnels Sand Co. at Lake Jackson.
Special items for the guidebook were prepared by Saul Aronow and
Adam N. Thomas of the Field Trip COIT@ittee, and by Bob H. Slaughter of the
Shuler Museum of Paleontology at Southern Methodist University. Much of
the drafting was done by Lawrence E. Aten and Richard H. Schaefer, and
Kenneth L. Cameron worked up some of the material for drafting. Miss Loy
B. Brown and Mrs. Elizabeth C. Howe did the typing.
The guidebook was prepared by Ronald W. Harlan and DeWitt C. Van Siclen,
who assume full responsibility for all mistakes, inaccuracies, and heresies.
They sincerely appreciate the efforts of all the individuals named, of the
Field Trip Cornmittee members, and of those on the other convention
committees who helped in many essential ways. To everyone they offer their
heartfelt thanks.

FOREWARD
The Houston Region may be regarded for present purposes as extending
from the coast inland to the top of the Hockley scarp, and from the
Brazos River Valley northeast to the San Jacinto River and Spring Creek.
Of all the plain adjoining the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, this
segment seems most suitable for study of the surficial geology. Lit has the
most closely-spaced network of roads; numerous excavations for drainage
and construction at times expose significant thicknesses of sediment; and
topographic maps with one (1) foot contour interval are available for the
geologically most critical part of the Region. These cover all of Harris
County, the only "inland" coastal county mapped on a one-foot interval
(S.D. Breeding et al. 1964, p. 21), and show much more detail than the
five-foot maps which are available for the rest of the Houston Region.
Investigators of the Houston Region, and of comparable areas to the
east and southwest, have concerned themselves principally with the
geomorphology. They have recognized a number of persistent coastal
terraces that extend about parallel to the shore and rise gently inland,
where they continue intermittently along the river valleys as stream
terraces. The coastal terraces are distinguished (and correlated)
principally on their rate of slope, elevation, and location; the older
terraces slope more steeply, occur at higher elevation, farther inland.
The two oldest terraces in the Houston Region are separated by the
persistent Hockley scarp, but the younger terraces merge imperceptibly.
This, and the presence of extensive low scarps evidently produced by
fault movement, make it impracticable to distinguish the coastal
terraces solely on the basis of scarps. The degree of preservation and
slope of depositional features, and conversely the degree of dissection
and stream pattern. serve as important criteria for recognizing the
younger terraces, but not for drawing precise boundaries between them.
Lithology and soils appear to be useful for mapping the contacts of
only the oldest and youngest (Recent) coastal terraces; other contacts
shown on maps are of necessity somewhat uncertain.
Almost as many systems of nomenclatur~ have been applied to the
coastal terraces and to the sediments underlying them as there have been
investigators. The stratigraphy has been studied very little because of
poor exposures,
of distinctive lithologies, and lack of usable
fossils" Also. the correlation of local units with
and

Pleistocene nomenclature applicable to Houston Region.
(Asterisk indicates original definition)

The Houston Region can be divided into four principal parts which are
distinctive in their sediments and landforms. On the northwest, extending
from beyond the Hockley scarp to its foot ( and in places as much as six
miles southeast of the foot of the main scarp), is a belt of gently rolling
to moderately dissected terrain with 10 to rarely 50 feet of local relief
(mllay from the major streams), Almost all exposures consist of slightly
consolidated clayey sand often containing small pebbles of chert, noncalcareous and highly iron~-stained, vJith ferruginous nodules abundant in

All along the south side of the valley of Buffalo Bayou (extending
somewhat north of it east of downtown Houston), and continuing southeast
to the coastal marshes, southwest to the valley of the Brazos River and
northeast almost to the San Jacinto River and to Galveston Bay, is an
area throughout which slightly modified depositional land forms can be
recognized without much difficulty. The most prominent of these landforms are very gentle ridges about 10 ft. high and several miles wide
which formed as natural levees along the Brazos River when it discharged
to the east (into the area of the present Galveston Bay) and southeast,
in the not-too-distant past. Host present streams there occupy the
former backswamps (tho several follow the former river channels), and all
lack the "high" terrace and corresponding sediments that characterize
Buffalo Bayou and all its tributaries from the north, (as well as the
larger streams farther northwestward). The sediments are practically
identical with the Lissie to the northwest, except that they are perhaps
slightly less compact. They will be referred to as the "Beaumont
Formation."
The fourth major subdivision of the Houston Region consists of
Recent sediments, principally in the valleys of the Brazos and San Jacinto
rivers, and along the coast. These do not seem to differ from the older
Lissie and Beaumont sediments of comparable environments except in being
much less compact and much less weathered (hence having much thinner
soil).

Buffalo Bayou and it's tributaries drain practically all
the City of Houston.

In it's natural condition Buffalo Bayou

was navigable upstream to the center of the city, after fallen
trees had been removed.

During the present century it has been

straightened and deepened, especially through the Port of Houston
and downstream into the San Jacinto ]{iver and Galveston Bay.
Upstream, its floodwaters are restricted by Addicks and Barker
dams west of Houston.
Like the majority of IIsecond order" streams along this part of
the Gulf Coast, Buffalo Bayou flows in an easterly direction, and
most of its tributaries enter from the northwest.

This pattern

implies that the direction of regional tilting during deposition of

This

to quicken the streams

flowing in that general direction and to stagnate the others; and also
to shift the lower part of the Brazos River into more easterly channels.
As a result, early in the deposition of the Beaumont Formation, the BrazosRiver flowed eastward into the present site of Galveston Bay,
building a deltaic plain (now marked by relict natural levee ridges,
etc.) extending eastward in front (south) of the gently seawardsloping Lissie plain.

This blocked the southeast-flowing consequent

drainage of the Lissie surface and forced it to' flow eastward along the
low ground next to the new deltaic plain, forming what has become
Buffalo Bayou.

This relationship is evident on Fig. 11 (from D. C.

Barton, 1930), and is precisely analagous to the present position of
Lakes Maurepas, Pontchartrain and Borgne in the low ground between
the Recent deltaic plain of the Mississippi River and the older
Pleistocene upland north of the lakes.

10

the western part of the Beaumont surface.

The terrace is absent

from the southerly tri butari.es, Brays Bayou and Sims Bayou, which
drain the Beaumont deltaic plain, and the terrace is indistinguishable
topographically from the more easterly part of the Beaumont surface
along the lower part of Buffalo Bayou and the lower San Jacinto River
valley,

(e.g., NE portion of Cordell Brick Co. pit just west of

Hunting Bayou between Loop 137 and Liberty Road.)

That the prominent

terrace is younger than some of the Beaumont tends to support in this
area, but not to prove, a subtle distinction drawn by Doering (1956,
p. 1838, fig. 5, reproduced here as Figure 13) between an older
Beaumont unit which he named the Oberlin Formation, and a younger
unit which he termed the Eunice Formation.

The well-developed

terrace along the valleys eroded into Lissie and older Beaumont sediments seems to be the inland equi'valent of the younger Beaumont del-

taic plain.
The present bayous entrench this prominent terrace, and have
developed minor terraces at lower levels.

Most good exposures along

the bayous show 10 to 20 feet of light-colored sandy terrace material
above, resting disconformably on mostly red clay (often mottled with
light gray to greenish clay) and tan to reddish brown silt and sand.
However, in a few exposures the terrace material extends down to and
below present drai.nage, it's base in such places often being marked
by a thin gravel of caliche fragments, ferruginous nodules, and
clay balls.

Locally the Im;ver fe\'1 feet of this thicker terrace material

is cemented into solid rock (that must be blasted for excavations).
In very few places do the present streams flow next to the valley

was straightened in 1960 and is currently being excavated further
and lined with concrete downstream.

Just south of the bridge the

bayou's west bank has recently been steepened, shifting the stream
westward in preparation for lining this portion of the bayou with
concrete.
The lower one-third

of the section consists of dark red,

finely laminated and often finely cross-bedded silt beds that have
been traced almost continuously close to water level for a distance
of several miles.

A two-foot bed of massive clay occurs about two

feet below the top of these silt beds.

The upper limit of the silt

beds is marked by an irregular contact with about one foot of relief
that probably represents a minor disconformity.

Remnants of filled

crawfish holes have been observed to extend downward from this contact

15

near where the North Loop freeway now crosses the bayou about one
mile upstream.
The middle third of the section consi.sts of silty and clayey,
very fme-grained, mottled red to very light gray sand that grades
upward to a clayey, very fine-grained white to light gray noncalcareous sand.

The upper one-third

of the section consists of

six feet of dark red, massive clay that contains numerous calcareous
nodules one-half to two inches in diameter; above which is
three feet of white to orange colored sand and two feet of dark gray
sandy soil.

This section has been described in detail by Harlan (1962).

The sharp, regular contact between the lower "white"
very fine-grained sand and the

~lying

dark red massive clay in

the upper fukd of the section marks a fairly widespread disconformity
which slopes regionally to the southeast (the apparent northward
dip of the contact at this locality being a local irregularity).
The light color of the sand unit is believed to

h~ve

been caused

by soil-forming processes which reduced and leached out the

~ron

that originally gave these sediments a red or brown color.

The

same sequence of dark red calcareous clay abruptly

~lying

light

gray non-calcareous sand has been observed at many localities
throughout the Houston area for some miles south and east of this
exposure, wherever this horizon should be exposed.
The valley through which White Oak Bayou flows has been partially
filled with about 10 feet of light gray, clayey, very fine-grained
sand which contains numerous ferruginous nodules.

a small channel that was present during deposition of the red

the fault is expressed topographically ,,,here it cuts Lissie

aquifers where beds of

unlike compactability are juxtaposed across

the fault.
Exposures of the fault were sought along both Buffalo Bayou and
White Oak Bayou, but without success due to slumping along the
projected trace.

However, good exposures immediately upstream from

where the fault should cross each bayou show that the distinctive
succession of upper red clay resting sharply on the white sandy
section (former soil) noted at Stop 1 and at many localities south
and east of there is definitely missing northwest of the fault.
From this it is inferred that the upper red clay (of Stop

1)

laps

out against the fault scarp and that northwest of the scarp the
equivalent of the underlying white sandy section is indistinguishable
in the present soil profile (and may have been partly or entirely
removed by erosion).

Hence, the disconformable contact of

upper

red clay on the white sandy section appears to be the most appropriate
position for the stratigraphic Beaumont-Lissie boundary in the
Houston area.

beyond which is a very gentle rise of 10 feet in 1.1 mi. across
the lOa-foot or Addicks scarp (of D. C. Barton 1930, p. 1302 and
1306).

This scarp can be recognized over a distance of 30 miles,

extending from extreme northern Fort Bend County N 55 0 E to 5
miles west of Humble (where it terminates against a large slope salient).
The scarp is obscure for about 4 miles southwest of the highway where
there appears to be an en echelon offset across the slope salient
pointed out on Figure 4.

Except for this obscure segment, the scarp

runs 5 to 10 feet high, and elevation of its base is consistently
90 to 95 feet throughout.

At its southwest end the scarp is

especially prominent on the north side of Buffalo Bayou, but is
absent south of the Bayou.

This is exactly what happens to the Long

Point scarp at Buffalo Bayou, as noted earlier, and the explanation
1.S

similar.
The Addicks scarp is undoubtedly caused by an almost continuous

aLignment of en echelon downcc·to--coast normal faul ts.

This

relationship could be produced by only one of the several origins
proposed for this scarp, faulting.

It is noteworthy that the drainage

has taken advantage of the structure; and that the fault is reflected
in mapping by the U. S. Bureau of Soils CGieb et al., 1928).
An irregular alignment of oil fields follows the low side of the
scarp, from Clodine Field on the southwest through Clodine North,
Satsuma, Fairbanks, Houston North, and Durkee fields to Aldine East
Field.

No attempt was made to carry the surface fault into the

subsurface, but faults in the appropriate position are shown on
the "Generalized Subsurface Structure Map" by George C. Hardin, Jr.
(1961, facing p. 22) in the Houston Geological Society publication
"Geology of Houston and Vicinity."

A considerable en echelon offset

is shm.m in the subsurface, between Clodine North and Satsuma fields,
corresponding to the four-mile segment across which the surface scarp
is obscure and seemingly offset.

Northeast of that offset the

subsurface map shows a continuous fault with one notahle bend, about
like the surface scarp.

At this locality an elevation difference of almost 35 feet
separates two gently-sloping topographic surfaces, as shown on
Fig. 5.

The higher surface has been conventionally mapped as

the Willis Formation, the lower as the Lissie Formation.

The scarp

which separates the two surfaces extends from south of Eagle Lake,

1930a), but is not as abrupt everywhere.
The origin of the scarp is questionable.

Barton (1930a)

(1) an ancient shore-line scarp;

(3) an uplifted flexure-share-line scarp;

or (4) a scarp of anyone of the three preceding types partly
buried under alluvial deposits.

More recently, Bernard et al.

(1962) stated that, from available data, it is believed to be an
erosional scarp between the Willis and Lissie plains, and not a
fault scarp.

However, the form of some segments of the Hockley scarp

does suggest faulting,

while the deflections up valleys support

an erosional origin for these segments.

These names are currently used by the Louisiana State

Fisk (1940) correlated the Willis Formation in Texas with the
Williana terrace in Louisiana.

He proposed that deposition of the

terraces was controlled by eustatic changes of sea level, and that
coastward tilting accompanied by gradual uplift inland caused each
successively older terrace to occur at a higher elevation and have
a greater surface slope, with each younger unit occurring farther
seaward as an off-lap deposit.
In the shallow road-cut from the base to the top of the scarp,
and farther northward along the highway, ferruginous nodules onequarter to one inch in diameter are concentrated in a layer two
to ten inches thick which is covered by one to three feet of sandy
topsoil.

The ferruginous material has been dug for road metal at

many localities in the Willis Formation, especially around the
hilltops.

At the base of the scarp the ferruginous layer appears

to dip beneath the much less ferruginous Lissie Formation.

Beneath

the ferruginous horizon occasional siliceous pebbles ranging up
to

1.5

inches in diameter and more numerous scattered ferruginous

nodules up to one inch in diameter occur in a mottled light

This same soil type is shown on Lissie

places along the Addicks (100 ft.) scarp,

so the same may be the case here.

Note Katy Field gas plant 5 miles ahead to the right (southwest).
We are about at the edge of the field as indicated by wells.
According to Caldwell Starkey (1953), Katy Gas Field was
discovered in February of 1935 at Stanolind Oil and Gas Co. and
Amerada Petroleum Corp. No.1 Thorp, on the basis of reflection
seismic work.

Production comes from various sands in the Cockfield

and Yegua formations of the upper Claiborne group in the Eocene,
at depths of 6,200 to 7,200 feet.

The field "is unique in having

no faulting in a region where complexly faulted domes are the rule."
"Katy field is an elongate domal uplift with its long axis
trending approximately N 10 0 W.

Length of the field is approximately

9 miles, width is almost 6 miles, and the productive area exceeds
30,000 acres.

Most geologists familiar with the Katy structure

consider i_t to be a "residual" or "interdomal" high, formed by
subsidence in the surrounding areas,

~-lhile

the field proper

remained at its original structural position.

This theory depends

on the existence of rim synclines around the nearby Hockley and
San Felipe salt domes.

Rim synclines are areas immediately adjacent

to or surrounding shallow salt domes, which are below the normal
regional dip position and which are actually closed lows or sinks.
They are assumed to have been formed by subsidence above an area
where salt has been removed by flowage toward the center of the

rising salt plug.

?

Large closed lows exist on the north sides of

San Felipe and Hockley salt domes, and the dip on the north flanks
of Katy field has been ascribed to the subsidence accompanying the
formation of these rim synclines.

This theory is furth.er supported

by the elevation of the Yegua on the crest of the structure where
it is encountered at depths that appear to be normal regionally
for the Yegua formation in the southeastern portion of Waller
county.
"An alternative theory is the presence of a very broad, flat,
salt uplift at considerable depth.
"All of the six producing zones consist of gray, fine to medium
grained, partially consolidated sand, with thin, lignitic shale

Effective gas closure in the Cockfield sand is about 225

The productive limits

of the upper four Yegua zones coincide fairly well over most of the
field to form the outermost limite; of production.

The Firfot and

Second zones are productive over a greater area in the north portion
of the field due to some shift in structure plus a change in sand

Hoskins Mound, a "typical Gulf Coast salt dome," described in detail
by Archer H. Marx, 1936, from whose paper most of the follmving
quotes are taken.
"The surface expression of the dome area is a low mound,
roughly circular in outline and rising above the general elevation
of the surrounding prairie about 25 feet, and 30 feet at the highest
point above sea level.

Since SUlphur-mining began, the topography

has been somewhat modified due to subsidence."

The original

surface topography over the dome is shown on Figure 8a.
Martin M. Sheets (1947, p. 223) has written that "C. M.
Sampson reports that subsidence is now occurring around the flanks
of Hoskins Mound ... which is being mined. . ..
... is in the order of 9 feet.

The maximum subsidence

Sampson further reports that 100

acres of area in the central part of this dome has risen a maximum
of 0.6 foot in the last 23 years.
careful level measurements.

This rise is indicated by

On this dome the central and eastern

parts of the cap rock are largely barren and have not been mined ....
Sampson points out also that the entire cap-rock mass, in places
more. than 200 feet thick, has been heated to approximately 300

0

F.

and that this temperature is maintained by circulating superheated
water, but expansion of this limestone would account for only about

o

15 foot which is much less than the recorded rise."

Sheets' map,

showing areas of subsidence and uplift, is reproduced here as
Figure 8b.

49

"The surface material of the dome consists essentially of
brownish yellow clay of Beaumont age.

Calcareous nodules are

found throughout this clay, and lenses of sand occur at the
surface."

Beneath the Pleistocene are "unconsolidated Tertiary

sediments, consisting of marls, sands, and clays."

Between these

and the salt is "a thick blanket of anhydrite and limestone, with
considerable native sUlphur occurring in the latter."
"Five wells, out of approximately four hundred drilled, have
encountered salt.

The information from these tests indicates a

rounded-top plug with a dip of about 10 feet per hundred in the
central area, increasing toward the flanks, where it pitches
abruptly near the edge of the cap rock.

The highest point at

which salt was encountered was at 1,070 feet below sea-level,
in a well near the center of the dome.

It is probable that the

area underlain by the plug is roughly circular in outline, and
about 500 acres in extend."

Refraction shooting to an 8,000' well

in the salt indicates that the column of salt leans to the southeast.
Figure 9a shows the configuration of the cap rock, and figure
9b is a west-east section through the dome.

"At Hoskins Mound,

the cap may be divided into three parts which, in downward sequence,
are as follows:

barren limestone; sulphur-bearing limestone (sulphur

horizon); and anhydrite.

"With the exception of slight variations,

the topography of the anhydciLe anel

li,l(lf?stone is sjmi lar'.

In the

flanking areas, these formations pitch steeply and extend down the
flanks of the plug for some distance.

Near the center of the dome,

level.

In a well on the south flank, a total of 709 feet of cap

rock was penetrated, drilling being discontinued in the top of the
anhydrite.
In addition to the minerals noted above, Archer reports
gypsum, celestite, pyrite, small specks of galena, quartz and
dolomite.

"It has been estimated from available records that the

total amount of oil produced from Hoskins Mound did not exceed
500,000 barrels."

There is no production today, although Texaco,

Inc. recently drilled a deep test to salt on the northwest flank
of the dome.

Dr. Saul Aronow, Professor of Geology at.Lamar State

College of Technology in Beaumont, who practically lives on a
continuation of this ridge, has prepared the account that follows.
This ridge in the Hoskins Mound area is a segment of the
Pleistocene Ingleside (sometimes called Live Oak) ba r ri e r island
system first described by Price (1933, 1947).

On figure 10 of

the guidebook the larger portions east of Galveston Bay are
referred to respectively as the Smith Point Ba rrie r , the Fannett
Beach Ridges, the Orange Barr ier, and the Houston Barrier, the
latter being the easternmost known surfacial occurrence.

Bay, the most prominent and well-defined parts are what we might
call the Hoskins Mound Barrier, our stop, and the low Rattlesnake
Mound, northeast of us across Chocolate Bay.

South of the area

shown on figure 10, the system continues beyond Baffin Bay, as
shown in Price

(1947, fig. 1) and in Bernard and LeBlanc (1965,

fig. 4).

The altitude of the system decreases toward the southwest.
The easternmost Houston Barrier has an altitude of about 25 feet
above sea level; the Smith Point Barrier, about 10 feet above sea
level.

Our altitude here at the Hoskins Mound Barrier is about 5

feet above sea level.

The portions to the southwest seem to have

about the same relation to sea level as do the Recent barrier
islands (e.g.

j

Padre Island).

The systematic variation in altitude,

assuming that all parts are contemporaneous, is undoubtedly due to
regional uplift and warping (cf, Henry, 1956),
The problem of the age and stratigraphic position of the
Ingleside system seems to be related to that of the associated
Pleistocene formations,

The discussion here is in terms of Fisk's

Richards (1939) suggests a Sangamon or Wisconsin/Illinoian
interglacial age.

If this were the time of deposition of the

Upper Lissie of Texas and the

Montgom~ry

of Louisiana, then the barrier

system must have been marginal to the seaward edges of these formations.
However, considering the way the Ingleside system is related to
the

Beaumoht~Prairie,

and its veneer-like thinness in some places,

it is best thought of as a sandy facies of these formations.

probably represents a temporary stabilization of sea level during
deposition of the several deltaic plains comprising the BeaumontPrairie sequence.

Fisk placed their time of deposition as

approximately mid-Wisconsin during an interglacial referred to as
Peorian (e.g., Fisk, 1944, p. 27-28) or Bradyan (e.g., Corpus Christi
Geological Society, 1962, p. 32).

Sea level during the deposition

of these formations presumably was similar to that of the Recent.
the Beaumont-Prairie are appaLently beyond the range of radiocarbon dating.

Oyster shells collected from a lagoonal facies of

the prairie Formation along the Houston River, just north of the
Houston Barrier in Louisiana, were older than 40,200 years.*
The airphoto mosaic, Plate lIE, clearly shows many Pleistocene
Brazos River distributaries in the vicinity of OUr stop, which
suggests that the area surrounding the Hoskins Mound Barrier was one
of active deltaic sedimentation.

Preservation of the barrier probably

is due to its close proximiLy to the Hoskins Ivlound salt dome, at one

time a positive structural feature.

All of the Hoskins Mound Barrier, and much of the surface of
the Pleistocene deposits to the northwest, are pretty badly infested
with pimple mounds of much disputed origin.

The mounds are

characteristic of post-Willis Pleistocene surfaces in Texas and are
best developed and most numerous on the Upper Lissie and Beaumont.
They are largely absent from the Recent (cf. Bernard et al., 1962,
p. 187-188).

The many circular to oval depressions or pock marks that can be
di.scerned on the airphoto mosaic (P late lIE) are fairly typical of
the Inglside.

Bernard and others (1962, p. 185-186) suggest that the

rounded peripheries of the depressions are due to wave erosion and
deposition.

Before municipal activities within the City of Houston, Texas, Buffalo
Bayou and its tributary, Sims Bayou, were shallow meandering streams choked
"lith vegetation.

Channel straightening and deepening related to flood

control has since exposed extensive pleistocene deposits previously buried
beneath the floodplain and/or masked by colluvium.

Detailed prospecting

of these exposures has produced several vertebrate fossil localities, one of
which produced a significant local fauna.

The best locaE ty is directly

across Sims Bayou from the Houston Prison Farm and within the lowermost

Several tons of the

sediments were quarried from this zone and processed for recovery of

horse"

Here such typical extinct forms as mammoth,

antelope, and armadillos are associated with several smaller

extant species.

It is from the known climatic tolerances of the

armadillos and the extant species that we are able to draw some insight
into the climate and environment of the area during the time of deposition.
That those winters were very mild with light frost being the most
severe weather in the area is evidenced by the presence of the giant
armadillo, Holmesina and the glyptodon, Boreostracon.

All armadillos are

extremely intolerant to cold because of their lack of insulation.

Modern

armadillos can withstand short periods of low temperature by burrowing,
but extensive burrowing for animals weighting several hundred pounds
would be unlikely.

The giant tortoise, Geochelone is also well known

for its intolerance to cold winters.

The summers may have been similar

to those that characterize the area today although the bog lemming,
Synaptomys australus in the fossil fauna may indicate that heat waves
such as occasionally occur along the coast today were infrequent if
present at all.

There is a decided southwestern aspect to the fauna with

such species as the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), gray wood rat
(Neotoma micropus), grasshopper mouse COnochomys
prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus

, and

which are currently restricted to

areas over a hundred miles to the west and southwest where annual
rai.nfall is somewhat less than occur at HOllston today

This suggested

aridi ty may be due to lower annllal rainfall, less well distributed rainfall, or an increase in evaporation due to the much warmer winters.

In

any case, the indication of desication may suggest a tentative correlation

60

with the Clear Creek local fauna of Denton County.

At Clear Creek

the

same animals are present and the,y are about the same distance from their
current range boundaries.

A radiocarbon date of the Clear creek

assemblage indicates an age between 33,000 and about 25,000 B. P.

The

radiocarbon date from Sims Bayou indicates only that the age is greater
than 23,000 B. P.

Even so, the earliest reported occurrence of the

cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus, a common element of the Sims Bayou local
fauna, is in the Moore pit assemblage of Dallas County.

The Moore pit

is stratigraphically lower in the same terrace which produced the Clear
Creek collection and is believed to date on the order of 45,000 B. P.
Therefore it appears that the cotton rat arrived in the southwest
during the last major interstadial.

The area during the earlier part

of this interstadial appears to have been moister than is the case today.
This is indicated by the presence of more eastern species at the Moore
Pit and other sites of like-age.

Thus it seems probable that the Sims

Bayou local fauna is closely related to Clear Creek and is probably
between 25,000 and 35,000 years old.

at Pierce Junction is a shallow salt dome, the salt being encountered
at a depth of 950 feet.

The salt spine is steep to ove.rhane;ing and

and is overlain by cap rock.

Oil accumulations have been found on

the flanks of the structure in each stratigraphic unit from the
lower Miocene through the Jackson.

The cap rock and the sediments

overlying the cap rock are barren.
"The structural pattern in Pierce Junction is fairly typical
of shallow salt domes in the Gulf Coast.

Stratigraphic convergence

and arching of sediments adjacent to the salt are shown on the
schematic west-east cross section of the field.

Structural effects

of drag between the salt plug and bordering sediments are particularly
apparent beneath the salt overhang on the eastern flanks of the
dome where beds dip steeply and in places are overturned.
"A radial fault pattern ... is typical of all flank horizons.

These are gravity type faults with throws ranging from 50 to 300
feet.

No peripheral faults have been recognized in the field."

Quoted from Charles N. Glass, 1953, p. 147.

The better preservation and greater eastward slope of the
Almeda and Missouri City ridges, relative to several older and
more obscure ridges farther northwest, between Brays Bayou and
Buffalo Bayou (shown in part on Pl. I and Fig. 11), suggests
some sort of hiatus between the two groups of ridges.

Doering

chose this hiatus to separate the Beaumont Formation in this
a~ea

into his Oberlin Formation and an overlying Eunice Formation,

as shown on Figure 13.
That this hiatus may be significant is supported by incision
of the prominent "high" Beaumont terrace along Buffalo Bayou and
several tributaries from the north into the older Beaumont
(Oberlin) surface in places.

The sediments underlying this

terrace along Hunting Bayou show clearly a similar relationship
to the older Beaumont section in good exposures near the northeastern corner of the Cordell Brick Co. pit in northeastern
Houston, between Hunting Bayou, Loop 137, and Liberty Road

0

However, the limited intervening soil development observed in
some (other) places suggests that the hiatus represents merely
an interval of time during which the Brazos River was debouching
farther south, in the area now covered by post-Almeda Ridge
sediment8~

Figure 14 is a section across Harris county, extending from
Spring Creek northwest of Tomball on the north, southeast through
Almeda to Clear creek, illustrating certain interpretations

66

proposed by two members of the Field Trip Committee.

Everyone

agrees with the pre.sence of Willis Formation beyond the Hockley
scarp on the northwest, and with the presence of Beaumont
Formation with meander belt ridges and intervening lows at the
southeast, but opinions differ about the intervening area.
Identity of the "considerably weathered" material,' typically
"limonitic brown sand," of Fig. 14 is highly questionable.

It

occupies the area immediately southeast of the Hockley scarp
(outlined on Pl. I by the heavy dashed line southeast of the
scarp and northeast of Highway 290), and is exposed best in
ditches in Tomball.

Some, like Doering 1956 (Fig. 13 herein),

have mapped it as part of the Willis Formation, while

other~

like

Bernard and Le Blanc 1965 (p. 139, Fig. 2), have placed it in the
Lissie Formation.

Perhaps, as here suggested, it really is an

intermediate unit; which might even be equivalent to the Bentley
Formation (terrace) of Louisiana (H. N. Fisk, 1938, 1940, 1944).
Farther south on Figure 14 (section C) is shown an interpretation
of the stratigr.aphic relationship of the Lissie and Beaumont
formations, and how their areal distribution may be affected by the
fault scarps.

This was discussed earlier, especially in connection

with Stop 1, pages 13-19.

The "obscure unconformity" south of

Brays Bayou on section D is disclosed by a fonner soil zone, in
which originally red clay has been altered to brown, with
accumulation of limonitic nodules in the old B-horizon.

This is

taken to mark the top of the "older Beaumont" (Doering's Oberlin
Formation), which is overlain by Missouri City Ridge sediment.
