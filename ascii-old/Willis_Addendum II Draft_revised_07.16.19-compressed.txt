MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP (Gulf South) has filed a Section 7(c) application for a certificate
of public convenience and necessity with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or
the Commission) for the proposed Willis Lateral Project (Project).
Perennial Environmental Services, LLC (Perennial) conducted an intensive Phase I cultural
resources survey for the majority of the Project in the Spring of 2018. The survey investigations
resulted in the documentation of one newly identified archaeological site (41SJ238) and one
prehistoric isolated find. The State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) provided concurrence
that the newly recorded site 41SJ238 is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) in a letter dated September 28, 2018. The Addendum I report detailed the results of
additional intensive cultural resources investigations conducted between May 23, 2018 and
September 17, 2018 for several discontinuous mainline tracts, access roads, two contractor yards,
and the Cleveland Rail Yard. The survey investigations resulted in the revisit and further
documentation of archaeological site 41SJ238. Addendum I was submitted to the SHPO on
October 12, 2018. The SHPO concurred with Perennial’s recommendations presented in
Addendum I in a letter dated January 7, 2019. Following the last submittal, additional Project
components were adopted (one contractor yard [Contractor Yard 4] and one additional temporary
workspace [ATWS] location), and tracts with denied access were granted survey permission by
landowners.
This Addendum II report details the results of additional intensive cultural resources investigations
conducted on May 6, 2019 for three discontinuous mainline tracts, Contractor Yard 4, and one
ATWS location. At the request of the SHPO, Contractor Yard 4 was revisited on July 5, 2019 to
gather additional data on the disturbances present across the property. Jennifer Cochran served as
the Principal Investigator for the Project, while Sarah Boudreaux and Colene Knaub conducted the
field investigations. These additional investigations were conducted in accordance with the
approved scope of work for the Project (dated March 29, 2018).
The area of potential effect (APE) is defined as any direct and/or visual effect to historic properties
listed or considered eligible for listing in the NRHP (36 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 800.5).
The APE for direct effects will be limited to the area of potential ground disturbance or any portion
thereof, which could be physically altered or destroyed by the undertaking. Perennial surveyed an
expanded environmental survey area (ESA) including a 200.0 to 300.0-foot-(ft-) (61.0 to 98.4meter-[m-]) wide mainline corridor and the total acreage of ATWS/contractor yard footprints.
Indirect (visual) effects are not addressed in this addendum as the current survey areas do not
include any permanent aboveground Project components.
In all, the Addendum II ESA totaled 18.7 acres (ac) (7.6 hectares [ha]). The Addendum II ESA is
coterminous with the Addendum II APE for direct effects. Depths of impact are anticipated to

range from 4.0 to 6.0 ft (1.2 to 1.8 m) along the mainline and 1.0 to 2.0 ft (0.3 to 0.6 m) within
ATWS and contractor/rail yard locations.
The additional Phase I cultural resources investigations, as presented herein, includes surveys at
five discontinuous locations, which include 0.3 mile (0.5 kilometer) (5.7 ac [19.5 ha]) of mainline
tracts, 0.7 ac (0.3 ha) of ATWS, and 12.3 ac (5.0 ha) of contractor/rail yards. Perennial excavated
a total of 19 shovel tests across the Addendum II ESA, and the survey investigations resulted in
entirely negative findings. To-date, the APE for the Project has been finalized, and all previously
unsurveyed portions of the Project due to restricted land access or newly added Project components
have been surveyed. In regards to Contractor Yard 4, this location was heavily disturbed at the
time of Perennial’s survey efforts of the property. The current landowner of the property indicated
that the location has been slated for commercial development since 2017, and all construction
activities that have occurred to-date on the property were planned prior to Gulf South’s
involvement with the property.
Based on the results of the survey effort detailed herein, no historic properties will be affected and
no further investigations are warranted within the Addendum II ESA that has been surveyed and
reported in this volume. In accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA (36 CFR 800) and the
guidelines set forth by the Texas Historical Commission/SHPO, it is Perennial’s opinion that no
further cultural resources investigations are warranted for the portions of the proposed Project that
have been surveyed and presented in this report.

INTRODUCTION
Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP (Gulf South) has filed a Section 7(c) application for a certificate
of public convenience and necessity with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or
the Commission) for the proposed Willis Lateral Project (Project).
The Project will entail the construction and operation of approximately 19.0 miles (mi)
(30.6 kilometers [km]) of new 24-inch diameter natural gas pipeline, one new meter and regulator
(M&R) station, and appurtenant facilities in Montgomery and San Jacinto Counties, Texas. The
Project also includes temporary contractor/rail yards, temporary access roads (TARs), and
permanent access roads (PARs) within Liberty, Montgomery, and San Jacinto Counties, Texas, as
well as the addition of compression and installation of a new interconnect at Gulf South’s existing
Goodrich Compressor Station, which is located in Polk County, Texas along Gulf South’s existing
Index 129 Legacy System (Table 1).
Perennial Environmental Services, LLC (Perennial) conducted an intensive Phase I cultural
resources survey for the majority of the Project in the Spring of 2018. The survey investigations
resulted in the documentation of one newly identified archaeological site (41SJ238) and one
prehistoric isolated find. The State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) provided concurrence
that the newly recorded site 41SJ238 is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) in a letter dated September 28, 2018. The Addendum I report detailed the results of
additional intensive cultural resources investigations conducted between May 23, 2018 and
September 17, 2018 for several discontinuous mainline tracts, access roads, two contractor yards,
and the Cleveland Rail Yard. The survey investigations resulted in the revisit and further
documentation of archaeological site 41SJ238. Addendum I was submitted to the SHPO on
October 12, 2018. The SHPO concurred with Perennial’s recommendations presented in
Addendum I in a letter dated January 07, 2019 (Appendix A). Following the last submittal,
additional Project components were adopted, and tracts with denied access were granted survey
permission by landowners.
Consistent with the FERC application requirements, and in accordance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (Public Law [PL] 89-665), as amended; it’s
implementing regulations, “Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties” (36 Code of Federal
Regulations [CFR] 800); and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (PL 91-190.
83 Stat. 852), the proposed Project must make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic
properties within the Area of Potential Effect (APE) and to take into account any direct or indirect
effects the proposed undertaking could have on properties listed or considered eligible for listing
in the NRHP.
This Addendum II report details the results of additional intensive cultural resources investigations
conducted on May 6, 2019 for three discontinuous mainline tracts, one contractor yard (Contractor
Yard 4), and one additional temporary workspace (ATWS) location. Jennifer Cochran served as
Willis Lateral Project – Addendum II

the Principal Investigator (PI) for the Project, while Sarah Boudreaux and Colene Knaub
conducted the field investigations. These additional investigations were conducted in accordance
with the approved scope of work for the Project (dated March 29, 2018).
The area of potential effect (APE) is defined as any direct and/or visual effect to historic properties
listed or considered eligible for listing in the NRHP (36 CFR 800.5). The APE for direct effects
will be limited to the area of potential ground disturbance or any portion thereof, which could be
physically altered or destroyed by the undertaking. Perennial surveyed an expanded environmental
survey area (ESA) including a 200.0 to 300.0-foot-(ft-) (61.0 to 98.4-meter-[m-]) wide mainline
corridor and the total acreage of ATWS/contractor/rail yard footprints. Indirect (visual) effects
were not addressed in this addendum as the current survey areas do not include any permanent
aboveground Project components.
In all, the Addendum II ESA totaled 18.7 acres (ac) (7.6 hectares [ha]). The Addendum II ESA is
coterminous with the Addendum II APE for direct effects. Depths of impact are anticipated to
range from 4.0 to 6.0 ft (1.2 to 1.8 m) along the mainline and 1.0 to 2.0 ft (0.3 to 0.6 m) within
ATWS and contractor/rail yard locations.
The additional Phase I cultural resources investigations, as presented herein, included surveys at
five discontinuous locations including 0.3 mi (0.5 kilometer) (5.7 ac [19.5 ha]) of mainline tracts,
0.7 ac (0.3 ha) of ATWS, and 12.3 ac (5.0 ha) of contractor/rail yards. To date all previously
unsurveyed portions of the Project due to restricted land access have been surveyed. If needed,
any modifications to the existing Project components will be address in subsequent variance
memos.
In practice, survey of the mainline tracts entailed the excavation of shovel tests along one to three
transects within a 100.0- to 300.0-ft- (30.5- to 98.4-m-) wide ESA corridor. Shovel tests were
typically placed at 164.0 to 328.0-ft (50.0-to 100.0-m) intervals depending on the nature of the
setting. In some areas, shovel testing was not feasible as a result of inundated lowland areas or
severely disturbed settings. These areas were visually inspected and photo-documented.
Perennial excavated a total of 19 shovel tests across the Addendum II ESA, and the survey
investigations resulted in entirely negative findings as discussed herein. Portions of the ESA also
contained existing buried utilities. As such, subsurface tests were spaced to avoid any disturbed
settings. In addition to the subsurface testing, the archeological field crew traversed the entire
Addendum II ESA to examine the modern ground surface for cultural materials between shovel
test intervals. Pedestrian survey transects were intended to provide adequate coverage of the space
between shovel tests. Any low-lying, inundated areas within the survey area were photodocumented; however, no shovel testing was conducted in these areas due to the reduced
probability for cultural resources.
This addendum report details the results of these additional survey efforts for the Project.
Comprehensive discussions on the environmental and cultural setting for the Project, as well as

detailed survey methodology, are provided in the initial survey reports for the Project (Cochran
and Boudreaux 2018; Cochran et al. 2019). Salient information is reiterated here in this addendum,
as necessary, to facilitate review as a stand-alone document, but the reader should refer to Cochran
and Boudreaux 2018 for a more thorough account of the Project.
Agency correspondence for the Project is presented in Appendix A. Mapping exhibits for the
Addendum II ESA are provided in Appendix B. The Unanticipated Discovery Plan is included
in Appendix C. Finally, landowner correspondence for the location in which Contractor 4 (Survey
Area 4) is located in provided in Appendix D.

RESULTS

FIELD SURVEY
A field crew comprised of two Perennial archaeologists conducted an intensive surface and
subsurface cultural resources investigation of the Addendum II ESA on May 6 and July 5, 2019.
The objectives of the additional Phase I cultural resources survey were to locate cultural resources,
delineate the vertical and horizontal extent where possible, provide a preliminary evaluation of the
NRHP-eligibility of each resource, and assess the potential for the Project to directly or indirectly
affect historic properties or other sensitive cultural resources. In general, the survey efforts were
conducted in accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA and the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)/Council for Texas Archeologists survey standards.
To-date, approximately 19.0 mi (30.6 km) [100.0%] of the proposed pipeline route, 16.0 mi
(25.8 km) [100.0%] of the proposed access roads, and 146.5 ac (59.3 ha) [100.0%] of the
contractor/rail yards have been surveyed for cultural resources.
The survey efforts included an intensive pedestrian survey supplemented by the excavation of a
total of 19 shovel tests. In non-disturbed areas, shovel tests were excavated at 98.4-ft to 328.0-ft
(30.0-m to 100.0-m) intervals on transects spaced no greater than 98.4 ft (30.0 m) apart along the
width of the ESA in areas with less than 40% ground visibility. High probability areas (HPAs)
and medium probability areas (MPAs) have been designated on the Survey Results Aerial Maps
provided in Appendix B.
MAINLINE PIPELINE CORRIDOR
Three areas along the proposed pipeline corridor were surveyed during the additional Phase I
survey efforts. Survey Area 1 consists of approximately 0.7 ac (0.3 ha) of ATWS located near
MP 0.7 along the mainline corridor. Current plans include utilizing this area for vehicle parking.
Survey Area 1 was bisected by an existing two-track gravel road. Vegetation present within this
survey area consisted of planted pine with vines and shrubby undergrowth (Figures 2 and 3).
Ground visibility was poor across Survey Area 1, and as such, three shovel tests were excavated
across the survey area at intervals no greater than 164.0 ft (50.0 m) apart. A typical soil profile
consists of up to 11.8 inches (in) (30.0 centimeters [cm]) of mottled 10 YR 4/3 and 7.5YR 5/2. No
cultural resources were identified as a result of these efforts across Survey Area 1.
Survey Area 2 consists of a 0.1 mi (0.1 km) section of the mainline. Based upon the proximity of
several waterbodies, the area was considered an HPA, and surveyed at intervals no greater than
98.4 ft (30.0 m) apart across three staggered transects. Beyond the utility corridor, land use
consisted of a heavily wooded setting with dense undergrowth (Figure 4). Ground visibility was
poor across the majority of Survey Area 2.

Figure 4. View of Survey Area 2, facing west.

Eleven shovel tests were excavated across the survey area, all of which were negative for cultural
resources. A typical shovel test excavated within Survey Area 2 consisted of 13.8 in (35.0 cm) of
10YR 5/2 sand overlying 10YR 5/6 sandy clay.
Survey Area 3 consists of 0.2 mi (0.4 km) of the mainline in Montgomery County between
MP 12.36 to MP 12.58. Due to ongoing landowner negotiations, the size of the Project ESA was
reduced in this area to only encompass the proposed workspace. Survey Area 3 primarily follows
an existing transmission utility corridor and existing gravel road (Figure 5 and Figure 6). Beyond
the utility corridor, land use consisted of a heavily wooded setting with dense undergrowth and
residential areas. Based upon the location and extended distance to sites and waterbodies, Survey
Area 3 was classified as an MPA, and shovel tests occurred at intervals approximately 164.0 ft
(50.0 m) apart. A total of five shovel tests were excavated within Survey Area 3, all of which were
negative for cultural resources. A typical shovel test consisted of 9.8 in (25.0 cm) of 10YR 4/3
loamy sand overlying 7.5YR 5/4 loamy fine sand.

CONTRACTOR YARD
During construction of the pipeline, the contractor will require off right-of-way areas for the
storage of pipe and equipment necessary for the construction of the Project facilities. These
contractor/rail yards will be located at various points along the length of the Project at locations
with convenient and safe access to the Project area. An effort has been made to identify and select
yards that have been previously disturbed by human activity, but do not have an ongoing land use
that would preclude Project usage. One new contractor yard (Contractor Yards 4) was identified
by Gulf South since the submittal of the original Phase I and subsequent Addendum I reports.
Survey Area 4 (Contractor Yard 4) is a newly identified Project component needed to facilitate
offsite contractor equipment storage. Contractor Yard 4 was surveyed during two separate survey
efforts on May 6, 2019 and July 5, 2019. During the initial survey efforts, the southern portion
(approximately 6.0 ac [2.4 ha]) of Contactor Yard 4 had been previously bulldozed (Figure 7 to
Figure 9). The northern 6.3 ac (2.6 ha) was being cleared and bulldozed at the time of the survey.
As such, the Perennial field crew did not enter the active work zone area due to safety concerns
around heavy machinery. A pedestrian survey was conducted over the southern portion of the
contractor yard to examine the ground surface for any cultural materials that may have been
impacted during the clearing conducted by the landowner.
Per a request by the THC, Contractor Yard 4 was revisited on July 5, 2019. The portions of the
yard previously under active construction were examined. Ground visibility across Survey Area 4
was excellent at 100 percent visibility (Figure 10 and Figure 11). Approximately 19 shovel tests
were excavated across Survey Area 4, all of which were negative for cultural resources. The shovel
tests revealed a heavily disturbed setting as evident by the previous ground clearing activities.
The landowner of the property on which Contractor Yard 4 will be located provided a statement
indicating that the property has been slated for commercial development since 2017. The
landowner also provided a signed statement and accompanying construction plans indicating the
proposed use of the property prior to any involvement with Gulf South (Appendix D). As such,
Perennial does not believe this should be considered anticipatory demolition under Section 110 (k)
of the NHPA.

NATIVE AMERICAN CONSULTATION
Although the Project does not cross any property defined as reservation or tribal lands, Gulf South
has submitted consultation letters to federally-recognized tribes with interests in Montgomery,
Polk, Liberty, and San Jacinto Counties, Texas. Specifically, consultation with the following tribes
was initiated by Gulf South on May 4, 2018: Comanche Nation, Tonkawa Tribe of Oklahoma,
Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas, and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma.
The consultation letter provided information to the Native American tribes about the proposed
Project and requested communication regarding any concerns they may have with respect to
possible impacts to properties of traditional religious and cultural significance. Gulf South and
FERC will continue consultation with interested tribes throughout the life of the Project.
UNANTICIPATED DISCOVERIES PLAN
Gulf South’s Unanticipated Discoveries Plan (UDP) includes procedures to follow in the event
that historic properties and/or human remains are encountered during construction. Consistent
with FERC guidelines for reporting on cultural resource investigations for pipeline projects, this
document describes the procedures for dealing with unanticipated discoveries during the course of
Project construction and provides direction and guidance to Project personnel as to the proper
actions to be followed in the event of an unanticipated discovery.
The procedures identified in the UDP will meet the Procedures for the Protection of Historic
Properties (33 CFR 325); Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act; Policy Statement
Regarding Treatment of Burial Sites, Human Remains, and Funerary Objects set forth by the
NHPA (PL 89-665), its implementing regulations, Projection of Historic and Cultural Properties
(36 CFR Part 800); Native American Grave and Repatriation Act (43 CFR Part 10); and
Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments (Executive Order 13175); and
subject to the provisions of the Texas Health and Safety Code (Title 8, Chapters 711-714).
In summary, if cultural resources and/or human remains are encountered during construction, work
in the immediate area will cease and a qualified archaeologist will be called to evaluate the
finding(s) and provide recommendations for how to manage the resource. All findings will be
reported to, and activities coordinated with FERC as well as the State Archaeologist. In the event
that human remains are encountered, all activities that might disturb the remains shall cease, and
may not resume until authorized by appropriate law enforcement or the State Archaeologist.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On May 6 and July 5, 2019, Perennial conducted an intensive Phase I cultural resources survey for
three discontinuous mainline tracts, one contractor yard (Contractor Yard 4), and one ATWS
location that were not previously surveyed for the Project. Jennifer Cochran served as the PI for
the Project, while Sarah Boudreaux and Colene Knaub conducted the field investigations. These
additional investigations were conducted in accordance with the approved scope of work for the
Project (dated March 29, 2018). All survey efforts were negative for cultural resources.
Based on the results of the survey effort detailed herein, no historic properties will be affected and
no further investigations are warranted within the Addendum II ESA that has been surveyed and
reported in this volume. In accordance with Section 106 of the NHPA (36 CFR 800) and the
guidelines set forth by the Texas Historical Commission/SHPO, it is Perennial’s opinion that no
further cultural resources investigations are warranted for the portions of the proposed Project that
have been surveyed and presented in this report.

PLAN FOR THE UNANTICIPATED DISCOVERY OF CULTURAL RESOURCES AND
HUMAN REMAINS
A.

INTRODUCTION

Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP (Gulf South) proposes to construct the Willis Lateral Project
(Project), which will include approximately 19 miles of 24-inch pipeline in Montgomery, San
Jacinto, and Liberty Counties, Texas. The Project will also include additional compression
within its existing Goodrich Compressor Station in Polk County, Texas, a new delivery and
receipt meter station. This document describes the procedures for dealing with unanticipated
discoveries during the course of project construction. It is intended to:


Maintain compliance with applicable Federal and State laws and regulations during
construction of the Project;



Describe to regulatory and review agencies the procedure the Project or its
representative will follow to prepare for and deal with unanticipated discoveries; and



Provide direction and guidance to project personnel as to the proper procedure to be
followed should an unanticipated discovery occur.

B.

PROCEDURES FOR THE DISCOVERY OF CULTURAL RESOURCES

In the event that any member of the construction work force believes that a cultural resource
discovery is encountered the following plan will be implemented:
1. All work within 100 feet both sides of the discovery will immediately stop and the
Environmental Inspector will be notified. The area of work stoppage will be adequate to
provide for the security, protection, and integrity of the materials. A cultural resource can
be prehistoric or historic and could consist of, but not be limited to:


An accumulation of shell, burned rocks, ceramics or other subsistence related materials



An area of charcoal or very dark soil with artifacts



Stone tools, arrowheads, or dense concentrations of stone artifacts



A cluster of bones in association with shell, charcoal, burned rocks, stone artifacts,
ceramics, or other culturally-modified items. A historic structure or assemblage of historic
materials older than 50 years

2. If the Environmental Inspector believes that the discovery is a cultural resource, the
Environmental Inspector will take appropriate steps to protect the discovery site. This
will include flagging the immediate area of discovery and stop work or exclusion zone, as
well as notifying the Environmental Project Manager and/or Company Representative.
Work in the immediate area will not resume until treatment of the discovery has been
completed.
3. Gulf South or its representative will arrange for the discovery to be evaluated by a
qualified archaeologist who meets the Secretary of Interior Standards for archeology.
The archaeologist will evaluate the remains and provide recommendations for how to
manage the resource under the State’s Historic Preservation Plan.

4. The archaeologist will seek consultation with the SHPO and FERC staff archaeologist
regarding the National Register eligibility status of the discovery. If the discovery is
determined to have the potential for eligibility, the archaeologist will consult with the
SHPO on how best to avoid, minimize, or otherwise mitigate further impacts. Treatment
measures may include mapping, photography, sample collection, or excavation activity.
5. The archaeologist will implement the appropriate treatment measure(s) and provide a
report on its methods and results. The investigation and technical report will be
performed in compliance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines
for Archaeological Documentation (48 CFR 44734—44737); the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation (ACHP) publication ‘’Treatment of Archaeological Properties’’
(ACHP 1980); and follow the guidelines set forth by the Texas State Historic
Preservation Office.
C. PROCEDURES FOR THE DISCOVERY OF HUMAN REMAINS
In the event that human remains are encountered during either construction or maintenance
activities, the following plan outlines the specific procedures to be followed. These procedures
meet or exceed the Policy Statement Regarding Treatment of Burial Sites, Human Remains,
and Funerary Objects adopted by the ACHP, “Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties” (36
CFR Part 800); Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties (33 CFR 325 Appendix C);
the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act, and Texas Health and Safety Code (Title 8,
Chapters 711-714).
All activity that might disturb the remains shall cease and may not resume until authorized by
appropriate law enforcement officials or the State Archaeologist. Any human remains, burial
sites, or burial related materials that are discovered during construction will at all times be
treated with dignity and respect.
1. The Site Manager- or archaeologist, if present, will notify Gulf South’s Environmental
Project Manager, the law enforcement agency and the coroner of the jurisdiction where
the site or remains are located within two days of the discovery. The State
Archaeologist will also be contacted to assist with identifying the remains, as required.
The FERC will also be notified.
2. Any activity that may disturb the unmarked burial site, human skeletal remains, or burial
artifacts associated with the site will immediately cease on discovery. The site will be
carefully covered and secured for protection from degradation by weather or
unauthorized individuals.
3. The Environmental Inspector will be responsible for taking appropriate steps to protect
the discovery. This will include fencing off the immediate area of discovery and flagging
the area as an exclusion zone. No activity may resume until authorized by the agency
authority governing the disposition of the human remains.
4. If the unmarked burial site, human skeletal remains, or funerary objects can be shown to
have ethnic affinity with a living Native American tribe, the Project’s Environmental
Manager will notify the SHPO and FERC to assist in determining the tribe(s), if any, who
may have historic ties to the region and represent descendants of any Native American

remains. If direct relations to a Native American tribe are verified, the tribe will have
control of the disposition of the human skeletal remains.
5. If the District Coroner finds that the unmarked burial site is over 50 years old and that
there is no need for a legal inquiry by their office or for a criminal investigation, and if no
direct relations to any Native American tribe are found, then the SHPO will have
jurisdiction of the site, human skeletal remains, and the burial artifacts.
