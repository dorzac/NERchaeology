ABSTRACT
On behalf of Willis Independent School District (Willis ISD), SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed 56-acre Willis ISD 9th
Grade Campus Development located in the northwest corner formed by the intersection of State
Highway 75 and Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 830 in Montgomery County, Texas. The proposed
project includes the development of an irregular 56-acre tract of previously undeveloped property for use by the Willis ISD as a 9th grade campus. The proposed project area is bounded by
the East Fork Crystal Creek to the north, Farm-to-Market Road 830 to the south, and the existing
Willis High School campus and State Highway 75 to the east. Investigations were conducted in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Permit No. 5334) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. SWCA’s investigations included
a background records review and an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area. Michael S.
Crow served as Principal Investigator, and conducted the survey along with Crystal C. Kauk on
July 6 and 7, 2009.
The background records review revealed that the project area has not been previously surveyed
for cultural resources and no prehistoric or historic archaeological sites are documented within or
adjacent to the project area. The nearest previously recorded archaeological site, an earlytwentieth-century homestead (41MQ54), is located approximately 1.90 kilometers (1.20 miles)
northeast of the project area.
Following the recommendations of the Texas Historical Commission (THC), as well as a background review of the area soils, geology, previously conducted cultural resource surveys, and
known cultural resources, the entirety of the 56-acre project area was surveyed. The survey investigation documented numerous ground disturbances resulting from bioturbation processes
(e.g., root penetration, tree fall, and animal burrows), as well as past logging activities evidenced
by numerous stumps, two-track trails, push-piles, and skidder paths. The survey consisted of a
systematic pedestrian survey and excavation of a total of 33 shovel tests. In general, shovel tests
were excavated to a depth of 25-100 centimeters below surface (cmbs), encountering sandy loam
over compact sterile subsoil. No prehistoric or historic cultural materials were encountered on
the ground surface or in any of the shovel tests.
In accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and Section 106 of the NHPA (36 CFR 800.4),
SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify archaeological historic properties
within the project area. As no properties were identified that meet the criteria for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as a
State Archaeological Landmark (SAL) according to 13 TAC 26.12, SWCA recommends no further archaeological investigations within the project area.

PROJECT TITLE: An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the 56-Acre Willis Independent
School District 9th Grade Campus Development, Montgomery County, Texas.
SWCA PROJECT NUMBER: 15720-305.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Willis Independent School District proposes to develop a 56-acre tract
of previously undeveloped property for use as a 9th grade campus. SWCA’s investigations included a background literature and records review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel
testing to systematically identify, record, delineate, and, if possible, determine the significance of
any cultural resources located within the project area.
LOCATION: The proposed project area is located in the northwest corner formed by the intersection of State Highway 75 and Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 830 in Montgomery County, Texas,
immediately west of the existing Willis High School campus. The East Fork Crystal Creek bounds the proposed project area to the north. It appears on the Willis, Texas 7.5-minute USGS
topographic quadrangle map.
NUMBER OF ACRES SURVEYED: Approximately 56 acres.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Michael S. Crow.
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT: 5334.
DATES OF WORK: June 6-7, 2009.
PURPOSE OF WORK: The purpose of the investigations was to determine if future development
of the project area would adversely affect significant cultural resources and to assist in complying with the Antiquities Code of Texas and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
NUMBER OF SITES: None.
CURATION: No artifacts were collected; thus, nothing was curated.
COMMENTS: In accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and Section 106 of the NHPA
(36 CFR 800.4), SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify archaeological
historic properties within the project area. As no properties were identified that meet the criteria

INTRODUCTION

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

On behalf of Willis Independent School District (Willis ISD), SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) conducted a cultural
resource survey of the proposed 56-acre
Willis ISD 9th Grade Campus Development
in Montgomery County, Texas. The purpose of the investigation was to determine if
future development of the project area
would adversely affect significant cultural
resources. Investigations were conducted in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of
Texas (Permit No. 5334) and Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended.

The project area is located in the floodplains
and low terraces sub-region of the South
Central Plains Ecoregion. This area marks
the western edge of the southern bottomland
hardwood communities of the Gulf Coastal
Plain and is largely composed of Holocene
floodplains and terraces where there is a distinct shift from upland to bottomland vegetation (Griffith et al. 2004).
The project and surrounding area is dominated by gently rolling topography dissected
by numerous stream channels. Elevations in
the project area range from 300 to 325 feet
above sea level along a southeast-tonortheast trending slope toward the East
Fork Crystal Creek, an incised, intermittent
drainage (Figure 2). Vegetation in the project area is dominated by pine and mixedhardwood forest, though pines become increasingly sparse approaching the East Fork
Crystal Creek. Evidence of past logging activities (e.g., stumps, two-track roads, pushpiles, and skidder paths) and recent land
clearing was documented throughout the
project area during the field investigations
(Figures 3 and 4).

SWCA’s investigation included a background literature and records review and an
intensive pedestrian survey of the entire 56acre project area. Michael S. Crow served
as Principal Investigator, and conducted the
survey along with Crystal C. Kauk on July 6
and 7, 2009. All investigations were in accordance with the standards and guidelines
of the NHPA and the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) minimum archaeological
survey standards for such projects.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
GEOLOGY
Willis ISD proposes the development of a
9th grade campus located immediately west
of the existing Willis ISD campus. The project area encompasses 56 acres of mostly
undeveloped woodland located approximately 2 miles south of Willis in Montgomery County, Texas (Figure 1). It is bounded
to the north by East Fork Crystal Creek,
State Highway 75 to the east, and FM-830
and a buried utilities corridor to the south.
The project area is depicted on the Willis,
Texas USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map.

The geology for the project area is mapped
as Pleistocene Willis Formation (Barnes
1992). This formation consists of clay, silt,
sand, and siliceous gravel, with some petrified wood and iron concretions (Barnes
1992).

HOUSTON-PALM
According to Abbott’s (2001) HoustonPALM, the project area is located in Map
Unit 2. Briefly, Map Unit 2 recommends
surface survey with shovel tests. Map Unit 2
is characteristic of Holocene age, alluvial,
eolian, or colluvial veneer deposits that exhibit low to moderate evidence of disturbance and rest on Pleistocene landforms
(Abbott 2001).

VEGETATION
The dominant vegetation community within
the project area can be characterized as forested upland. Common tree species in the
forested upland community include loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), sweet gum (Liquidambar
styraciflua), water oak (Quercus nigra),
American elm (Ulmus americana), winged
elm (Ulmus alata), and southern red oak
(Quercus falcata). Common shrub species
include yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), American
beauty-berry (Callicarpa americana), and
Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense).

CULTURAL SETTING
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The most extensive archaeological research
in Montgomery County has been associated
with several reservoir projects and largescale developments. The first, in 1956, was a
survey of Lake Conroe, which was originally referred to as the Honea Reservoir,
prior to its impoundment (Shafer 1966). Archaeologists from the Texas Archeological
Salvage Project recorded 33 archaeological
sites (41MQ4– 41MQ36) during the course
of the survey and subsequently conducted
excavations at three of the sites (41MQ4,

soils in the project area include Betis fine
sand (60 percent), Conroe loamy fine sand
(37 percent) and Betis loamy fine sand (3
percent) (NRCS 2009). These units consist

in terms of artifact date ranges. The following summary is based on the prehistoric cultural history proposed by Story (1990).

41MQ5, and 41MQ6) in 1967 (Shafer
1968).
The largest investigation in the county was
conducted in 1979 when archaeologists from
Greiner Engineering Sciences, Inc., of
Tampa, Florida, surveyed 23,000 acres
along Spring Creek for the Woodlands Development Project (Greiner Engineering
Sciences 1981). Their investigations recorded 12 prehistoric sites (41MQ63–
41MQ74). Half of these were classified as
Late Prehistoric sites, and two were classified as sites with Late Prehistoric and Archaic components. The other four sites had
no diagnostic artifacts. Further testing was
conducted at 41MQ70 and 41MQ73; site
41MQ73 was found eligible for listing in the
NRHP.

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
The prehistoric cultural history of southeast
Texas has been divided into three general
periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, and Ceramic.
The Paleoindian period (12,000–7000 B.P.),
called the “Early Cultures” by Story
(1990:168), is most conspicuously identified
by lanceolate projectile points with ground
lateral and basal margins. Clovis, San
Patrice, and Scottsbluff types are distributed
throughout the East Texas part of the Gulf
Coastal Plain, although Folsom and Dalton
points tend to occur only in the northern and
north-central areas. A general picture of
these early people has been reconstructed
from a relatively scant record. Their highmobility lifestyle depended upon a diversity
of food resources, including big game
mammals. Population densities were low
and social structure is hypothesized as relatively simple.

The next large-scale project to take place in
the county was the Lake Creek Reservoir
survey. The Texas Archeological Survey
Project surveyed the 3,570-acre project area
along Mound, Fish, and Lake Creeks in
1986 (Bement et al. 1987). The survey
documented 46 prehistoric sites (41MQ75–
41MQ120), four of which had historic components (Bement et al. 1987). In general, the
prehistoric sites were found along the terraces of the creeks and included low-density
artifact scatters. Many of the sites with temporally diagnostic artifacts included Ceramic
and/or Late Prehistoric period components,
although a few contained Archaic dart points
(Bement et al. 1987).

ARCHAIC PERIOD
The Archaic period encompasses a wide
span of time (7000–1900 B.P.) and cultures.
Two basic characteristics, along with various adaptive changes, distinguish this from
the earlier period. The “increased density of
population and reduction in size of the area
exploited” (Story 1990:213) are evidenced
in the material record by a number of
changes. Projectile point styles proliferated
while displaying greater geographical and
temporal specificity. Lithic technology became more expedient and liberal with raw
material as locally available lithic resources
were more commonly exploited. Specialization in cooking features and food processing

CULTURAL HISTORY
Several comprehensive reviews of the cultural history of southeast Texas have been
completed in the past two decades, beginning with Aten’s (1983) study of the Upper
Texas Coast. Story (1990) and Patterson
(1995) both relied heavily on Aten’s (1983)
work but expanded and modified his cultural

4

again in this area. The land that encompasses what is now Montgomery County
was a portion of Stephen F. Austin’s land
grant. Forty-two families moved into the
area in the late-1820s, one of which was
Andrew Montgomery. Montgomery immediately established a trading post at the
crossroads of two established Native American traces and the town of Montgomery
quickly grew around the store (Long 2009).

implements suggest more intensive utilization of available plant resources. Shell exploitation along the coast became more
prevalent as evident by ubiquitous shell midden sites. Archaeologically, the Archaic is
much more visible, as these adaptations left
a more voluminous and diverse legacy of
sites and materials.
CERAMIC PERIOD
The Ceramic period or “Late Cultures” as
defined by Story (1990), for southeastern
Texas began roughly 2,000 years ago. The
earlier manifestations of this period have
been otherwise named “Woodland,” as tribute to certain similarities held with eastern
cultures, or “Mossy Grove,” Story’s
(1990:256) name for the local manifestation.
A pervasive characteristic of these cultures
is the ubiquity of plain sandy-paste ceramics. Kent and Gary points were common in
the early stages of this period and were
eventually displaced by arrow points such as
Alba and Catahoula, perhaps as early as A.D.
500 to 600. Subsistence strategies depended
on hunting and gathering, with little if any
evidence of horticulture. Bison may have
been exploited in the few centuries prior to
European contact.

The county was one of the first established
by the Republic of Texas Congress in 1837
and it was named after Montgomery, the
largest town in the area. From the 1830s until the eve of the Civil War, the county
gradually shifted from a subsistence-based
farming economy to a prosperous plantation
community. By 1864, the total population
of the county was 5,479 people, 3,356 of
which were enslaved (Campbell 1989:266).
The main plantation crop was cotton, though
limited tobacco and sugar were also produced. Since the majority of the voting
population was men who immigrated to
Texas from other southern states, it is not
surprising that nearly 80 percent of them
voted for secession from the northern states
in 1860 (Long 2009).
During the Civil War, three-quarters of all
Montgomery County volunteers were killed
or injured. The loss of life, emancipation of
the workforce, and general decline in the
U.S. economy devastated the county economically. The arrival of the railroad in
1871 brought new opportunities to the area,
including lumbering and cigar production,
and caused the county seat to move from
Montgomery to Conroe in 1889. After the
establishment of the railroad, lumbering became the most lucrative of all Montgomery
County businesses. Between 1880 and 1920,
“much of the county was deforested, permanently altering the landscape” (Long 2009).

HISTORIC PERIOD
The earliest European to explore what would
become Montgomery County was René
Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. An expedition led by La Salle passed through in
1687 looking to establish a permanent
French presence in the area. La Salle’s colony was ill fated, and subsequent permanent
settlement was not attempted until the mideighteenth century, when the Spanish established three missions along Spring Creek
(Long 2009). These missions were shortlived, however, and were abandoned in
1756. It was not until the 1820s that permanent European settlement was attempted
5

quickly developed into shipping hubs for
lumber, agriculture, agricultural implements,
cotton, livestock, and bricks (Jackson
2009a).

The remainder of the twentieth century was
dominated by oil production, first discovered near Conroe in 1932 (Long 2009).
Though logging continued in small sections
of the county, by 1990, most of the forests
had regenerated. However, the new trees
had a hard time growing in the nutrientdepleted soils, and the forests never regained
their previous, pre-logging appearance.
Livestock and livestock products, greenhouse products, logging, and oil continue to
be the main economic staples of the county,
though the majority of the population is employed in nearby Houston, 40 miles to the
south.

Spurred by a thriving timber industry, Conroe and Willis continued to grow in the
early-twentieth century. The Delta Land
and Timber Company, introduced in 1913,
became one of the largest milling operations
in the region and employed 700 people in
Conroe (Jackson 2009b). Willis became the
leading tobacco growing region in the state,
supporting as many as seven cigar factories
(Jackson 2009b). The area economy declined in the 1920s, but was later revived
with the discovery of oil in Montgomery
County (Long 2007). Conroe and Willis enjoyed the resulting boomtown effect during
this period in which they saw a rapid increase in population and improvements to
the transportation infrastructure, including
the extension of US Highway 75. However,
as the oil boom faded, so did the populations.

CONROE/WILLIS AREA
The project area is situated between the city
of Conroe and town of Willis in central
Montgomery County, Texas. Tracts of land
in the area were first settled in the late
1830s, but significant growth did not occur
until railroads appeared in the mid-to-latenineteenth century (Jackson 2009a; 2009b).
Agriculture and the timber industry were the
main components of towns’ economies.
Conroe was named in honor of one of the
area’s first sawmill proprietors, Isaac Conroe of Houston (Jackson 2009a). The town
of Willis was named after Peter J. and Richard S. Willis, brother merchants from Galveston who donated a townsite to the Houston and Great Northern Railroad.

During World War II, the lumber industry
made a short-lived revival, but no significant
growth in the town occurred until the impoundment of Lake Conroe in the late 1960s
and early 1970s and construction of Interstate 45 in the early 1970s. Since this time
Conroe and Willis have experienced steady
growth due to its proximity to the Houston
metropolitan area, as well as recreational
opportunities provided by Lake Conroe
(Jackson 2009a).

With the arrival of an extension of the Gulf,
Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway in Conroe
and the Houston and Great Northern Railway through Willis in the late-1870s, both
cities launched a prolonged struggle to transfer the county seat from Montgomery, but in
the end Willis was unsuccessful (Jackson
2009b). Conroe possessed the only junction
of major rail lines in the county, and replaced Montgomery as the county seat. Post
offices were established in the each city and
during this period, both communities

archaeological sites recorded within or adjacent to the project area. The investigation
utilized records available on the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Archaeological
Sites Atlas (Atlas). Site files, relevant maps,
NRHP and SAL listings were examined.
Site locations were plotted on project area
maps, and relevant site files were examined.

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review revealed that the
project area has not been previously surveyed for cultural resources and no prehistoric or historic archaeological sites are
documented within or adjacent to the project
area. The nearest previously recorded archaeological site, 41MQ54, is located 1.90
kilometers (1.20 miles) northeast of the project area. Site 41MQ54 is an earlytwentieth-century homestead recorded during a survey of the North Forest Subdivision, Section V in 1986. Further testing was
recommended to determine the site’s eligibility for listing in the NRHP (41MQ54 Site
Form).

FIELD METHODS
A crew of two SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the
entire 56-acre project area. During the survey, the archaeologists walked along transects spaced at 30 meter intervals examining
the ground surface and erosional profiles for
cultural resources. The archaeologists utilized shovel tests and cutbank exposures to
test for subsurface archaeological deposits
and assess the geomorphic setting of the
area. Shovel tests were excavated in 20 centimeter arbitrary levels to one meter in depth
or to culturally sterile deposits. Excavated
soil was screened through ¼-inch mesh to
retrieve any cultural materials that might be
present. Each shovel test was recorded on
appropriate project field forms and its location plotted using a handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) unit.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELD SURVEY
On July 6 and 7, 2009, two SWCA archaeologists conducted a cultural resource survey of the entire 56-acre project area (Figures 5 and 6). The survey included an intensive pedestrian survey and excavation of a
total of 33 shovel tests (Appendix A). An
additional shovel test was attempted, but not
excavated due to the degree of disturbance
in the area.

The utilization of shovel tests was keyed to
the level of disturbance in the project area
and the nature of the soils, geology, and topography. Soils encountered during the survey were consistent with the Betis and Conroe series, and shovel tests were terminated
in archaeologically-sterile subsoils; therefore, no backhoe trenching was conducted
during the survey.

Generally, shovel tests ranged from 25-100
cmbs below surface encountering light gray
to dark brown sandy loam over compact
sterile subsoil. No cultural material was
identified on the ground surface, along cutbank exposures, or in any of the shovel tests.

The survey was of sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and possible significance of any cultural resources located
within the proposed project area. The survey

bioturbation processes, as well as the development of the nearby Willis ISD campuses.
In accordance with THC guidelines, 33
shovel tests were excavated within the 56acre project area. No prehistoric or historic
cultural materials were encountered during
the survey.

Overall, the survey documented pervasive
ground disturbances throughout the project
area associated with past logging practices,
bioturbation processes (root penetration, tree
blow-downs, and animal burrows), and construction of the adjacent Willis ISD campuses. These disturbances have minimized
the potential for intact buried cultural deposits in the project area.

In accordance with the Texas Antiquities
Code and Section 106 of the NHPA (36
CFR 800.4), SWCA has made a reasonable
and good faith effort to identify archaeological historic properties within the project
area. As no properties were identified that
meet the criteria for listing on the NRHP
according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation
as a SAL according to 13 TAC 26.12,
SWCA recommends no further work within
the project area.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Willis ISD, SWCA conducted
an intensive archaeological survey of the
proposed 56-acre Willis ISD 9th Grade
Campus Development located in Montgomery County, Texas. The purpose of the investigation was to determine if future development of the facility would adversely affect
significant cultural resources. The investigation was conducted in accordance with
Antiquities Code of Texas, as the Willis ISD
is recognized as a political subdivision of
the State of Texas. The work was completed under Texas Antiquities Permit number 5334. SWCA’s investigations included
a background records review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing to
systematically identify, record, delineate,
and, if possible, determine the significance
of any cultural resources located within the
project area.
