ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the Geokinetics USA, Inc.’s Perry Ranch 3-D
seismic survey was conducted by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) in
conjunction with Dixie Environmental Services Company (DESCO), LP from June
13, 2008 through July 18, 2008. A previous avoidance plan prepared for
Quantum Geophysical, Inc. (now Geokinetics USA, Inc.) by BVRA identified high
probability areas within the 88.6 square mile seismic project area. The client
wants to drill within some of the high probability areas identified by BVRA in the
avoidance plan (Moore and Baxter 2007). Therefore, archaeological
investigations were required prior to drilling. These investigations visited 360
source point locations and conducted shovel testing or visual inspection in those
areas that were not disturbed or under water. No previously unrecorded
prehistoric sites were found during the terrestrial survey. In all, 361 source
points were investigated. It is estimated that 2401 square feet was investigated
at each source point. A total of 866,761 square feet (19.90 acres) was surveyed
within the terrestrial high probability area, and no prehistoric or historic sites were
found. However, a single grave containing the remains of Alcinda Bluitt was
observed. The date on the headstone reads _809 – 1929. No additional
information regarding this person was found during our research.
In addition to the terrestrial survey, a magnetometer survey of 177 source
point locations was required due to the presence of an area considered by the
State Marine Archeologist to be a high probability area for shipwrecks. This work
was performed by PBS&J of Austin, and their report is presented as Volume II.
The nautical survey found one anomaly in the current project area that
resembled a magnetic signature that may represent a shipwreck. The source
point involved was relocated to a point outside the 300-foot buffer. Another
source point was also moved because of a location conflict with another
presumed shipwreck anomaly found on a previous survey by PBS&J (Hudson et
al. 2008) performed after the avoidance plan was submitted. The two potential
shipwreck sites were avoided by moving the source points.
It is, therefore, recommended that the client be allowed to conduct the 3-D
seismic survey as planned. Copies of the final report are on file at the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE),
Galveston District, DESCO, and BVRA. The field crew did not collect any
artifacts.

INTRODUCTION
Geokinetics USA, Inc of Houston, Texas was granted permission by the
USACE, Galveston District (Permit Application number SWG-2007-1274) to
conduct a 3-D seismic survey in an 88.6 square mile area (hereafter referred to
as the current seismic project area) in Brazoria and Matagorda counties, Texas
(Figure 1) under Nationwide Permit 6. It should be stated here that only a small
portion of the project area involves Matagorda County. The purpose of this
seismic survey is to provide a high-resolution image of the subsurface geological
features that will allow the client to effectively evaluate the hydrocarbon reserves
underlying the project area. The proposed seismic survey involves the collection
of seismic data through an established receiver grid that will record the reflected
seismic waves of small explosive charges at set intervals across the project area.
By virtue of the Nationwide Permit 6 permitting process, this project was
subject to the regulation of 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C (Processing
Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic
Propterties: Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Document dated April
25, 2005). In an effort to minimize impacts to cultural resources in the project
area, Geokinetics USA, Inc. sponsored an avoidance plan that was prepared by
BVRA (Moore and Baxter 2007) and submitted to and approved by the USACE
and THC in 2007. This plan identified the recorded cultural resource sites and
provided for their protection through avoidance measures involving a buffer
within which no seismic activities could take place. The plan also identified high
probability areas for either prehistoric or historic terrestrial sites and for nautical
sites and stated that these areas would be avoided unless an archaeological
survey of the source point locations was conducted prior to drilling. Due to data
quality issues, the client decided that drilling would be necessary within some of
the high probability areas identified within the avoidance plan. Therefore, an
archaeological survey was deemed necessary.
The project area covered in this report includes the aforementioned high
probability areas. Any proposed source points placed within these areas were
subject to archaeological investigations. This survey was divided into two
phases. These phases are a terrestrial archaeological survey and a nautical
magnetometer archaeological survey. The terrestrial investigation was performed
by a team of archaeologists employed by DESCO, and the nautical investigation
was performed by PBS&J of Austin, Texas. Edward P. Baxter, a consulting
archaeologist, was contracted to oversee and aid in both the fieldwork and report
preparation. BVRA was contracted to manage the project and produce the two
reports. The terrestrial report is Volume I, and the nautical report is Volume II.

Water bodies encompassed within the project area consist of the San
Bernard River, McNeal Lake, Pelican Lake, Jones Lake, Cedar Lakes, Cowtrap
Lake, Jones Creek, Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, and a small portion of the Gulf of
Mexico. No source points will be located in the San Bernard River, Jones Creek,
or the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The project area encompasses the San
Bernard National Wildlife Refuge and the Peach Point Wildlife Management
Area. Topographic coverage of the project area is provided by four United States
Geologic Survey 7.5’ topographic quadrangles. They are Cedar Lakes East
(2895-432), Cedar Lakes West (2895-341), Cedar Lane NE (2895-344), and
Jones Creek (2895-433). The project area is depicted on the four topographic
maps as Appendix I to this report.

ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTION
Portions of the following description of the area were excerpted from a
contract report authored by Voellinger and Nash (1989:2), the soil survey for
Brazoria County (Crenwelge et al. 1981), and a manuscript authored by Tanya
Matherne of Dixie Environmental Services Company of Magnolia, Texas.
The project area is located on a broad plain within the Holocene delta
formed by the Brazos and Colorado rivers. Other water sources include several
lakes and a small portion of the Gulf of Mexico in the southeast corner. This area
consists of nearly level terrain that is dissected by various streams flowing into
the Gulf. In the project area there are only three major gulf-flowing streams.
They are the San Benard River, Redfish Bayou, and Jones Creek (a former
channel of the Brazos River). The San Bernard River flows through the project
area from Pleistocene uplands at the northern portion into and through the
Holocene delta where it enters the Gulf of Mexico. The San Bernard River is not
capable of forming its own delta. This river is characterized as a low energy
steam originating within the Gulf Coastal Plain. At the north end of the project
area just above the Eastern Branch Cemetery is a small segment of the Brazos
River.
At its apex, the Holocene delta mentioned above is approximately 51
kilometers wide and extends inland about 35 kilometers. Surface features
include levees of the San Bernard River system, chenier ridges (former
beaches), and man-made levees associated with the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.
Overall, there are 1.5 meters of natural topographic relief. Most of the soils in the
project area are poorly drained and slowly permeable. They are mostly clays that
range from saline to non-saline. The climate is classified as moist sub-humid.
Rain occurs throughout the year with 60% falling between April and September.
Average annual rainfall is approximately 52 inches.
The project area is located within the Texan Biotic Province as defined by
Blair (1950). This is the large ecotone between the forests of the Austroriparian
Province to the east and the grasslands in the western part of the state. Local
habitats consist of upland prairies, salt and brackish marsh, and shoreline. The
upland prairies host wildlife including coyotes, hogs, and bobcats, while the shore
areas host herons, ibis, sandpipers, avocets, and stilts. More uncommon marsh
and water birds, including roseate spoonbills, whitefaced ibis, and yellow rails,
make seasonal appearances in the area. Several islands in the Cedar Lakes
area support a colonial waterbird rookery used annually by over 8000 nesting
pairs of fifteen different species, including royal terns, laughing gulls, and
Louisiana herons. The endangered eastern brown pelican is occasionally seen
here also.

The Peach Point Wildlife Management Area and portions of the San
Bernard National Wildlife Refuge are located within the project area. These areas
provide essential winter habitat for birds on the Central Flyway, one of four major
migratory routes over the continental United States. During the winter months,
duck and geese populations reach peaks as high as 35,000 and 90,000,
respectively. Numerous species of marine life, most notably several living reefs
of colonial oysters, also inhabit the marshes and waters of the project area.
The landscape in the project area has been altered by the construction of
the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway in 1938. The channel of the San Bernard River
was dredged from the waterway to a point 46 kilometers upstream. Although the
delta of the Brazos River continues to grow, the San Bernard River does not
carry a load sufficient to develop its own delta. Without the contribution of the
sediments by the Brazos River, the San Bernard River would probably empty into
a small estuary about 30 miles north of its current mouth. Creation of a new
Brazos River channel in 1929 has caused erosion to occur along the San
Bernard westward to Brown Cedar Cut in East Matagorda Bay. Approximately
eight meters of sediment erodes from the river annually. At the same time, the
area east of the San Bernard continues to prograde. From 1853 to1957, the
shoreline east of the river receded approximately 380 meters. The same area
prograded 230 meters from 1957 to 1974. By 1983, there was evidence of
several generations of beach ridges that had generated recurves into the mouth
of the San Bernard River, though the mouth had not yet migrated significantly
westward (Klaus and Lin 2002:14). Beginning around 1984, the mouth of the
San Bernard River was forced to migrate west (downdrift) due to the
accumulation of recurves that had now formed a spit. Elongation of the spit
proceeded slowly until the early 1990s when it accelerated rapidly. Kraus and
Lin (2002) hypothesized that this sudden acceleration was due to a substantial
flood in 1992 that deposited an estimated 8.4 million cubed meters of sediment at
the new Brazos delta. This surge in sediment load was reworked into an
elongated shoal down the coastline of the mouth of the Brazos River that
eventually migrated westward and merged with the existing shoreline (Kraus and
Lin 2002:12). The weak discharge of the San Bernard River has not been
sufficient to maintain a stable channel cross-section or location, and continued
littoral deposition since the 1992 flood has resulted in the constriction of the river
mouth to the point that it is no longer navigable. Figure 2 illustrates the prairie
grass that dominates the area investigated during the terrestrial portion of this
study, and Figure 3 illustrates the marshy areas investigated during the terrestrial
portion of this study.

METHODS
The first step in this project was a review of the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas and the site files at TARL to ensure that no new archaeological sites or
shipwrecks have been recorded in the project area since the avoidance plan was
prepared. A Research Design was prepared and submitted to the THC and
USACE for approval. The following methods describe the terrestrial survey. The
methods followed during the magnetometer survey are described in the report by
PBS&J (Volume II).
The survey crew visited each of the 360 source point locations placed
within the established high probability areas. Each source point was evaluated,
and shovel testing was conducted at those points where conditions were
favorable. Areas found to be disturbed, under standing water, or having clay at
the surface were not tested (n=61). The source points were marked with lath and
flagging, and the source point number was written on each stake. In addition to
shovel testing, the ground surface in the immediate area of each stake was
examined for evidence of cultural materials or features. Overall, the Holocene
soils were shallow with clay present at depths of <10 cm to 70 cm. The majority
of the tests were terminated at 50 cm or less. Of the 299 shovel tests in the
seismic project area, only 17 were dug to depths of 50 cm or greater. All
excavated soil was passed through ¼ inch hardware cloth. The location of the
source point locations appears on the topographic maps as Appendix I. The Log
of Source Points Investigated (Appendix II) depicts the stake numbers for each
source point, offset distance and direction, depth of shovel test, reason for
termination of each test, and other comments such as soil type. Areas not shovel
tested are easily recognized by the phrase “none” in the depth column.
Some source points were placed within the boundary of a National
Register District, the Duranzo Plantation (41BO136). Prior to any archaeological
investigation of this area, William A. Martin of the THC was consulted by Mr.
Baxter (personal communication, June 30, 2008) as to the proper procedure for
these investigations. The approved methods involved shovel testing, surface
investigations, and a statement of no impact from other ground disturbing
activities such as rutting.

CULTURAL CONTEXT
Introduction
A detailed discussion of the culture sequence of the project area is beyond
the scope of this report. Although the project area is located in two coastal
counties, it is part of the Southeastern Region of Texas as defined by the Texas
Historical Commission. Figure 4 illustrates the Southeastern Region with Brazoria
County highlighted. Detailed summaries of Southeast Texas prehistory have been
prepared by various researchers with the most notable examples being the
scholarly works by Lawrence E. Aten (1983a, 1983b) and Dee Ann Story, et al.
(1990). In Ensor’s (1991:5) prehistoric overview prepared for the Cypress Creek
study, he states that the best chronological and stratigraphic data currently
available for interpreting the successive cultural adaptations in Southeast Texas are
found in the following sources: Wheat (1953), Shafer (1968, 1975, 1988),
Patterson (1979, 1983), Hall (1981), Aten (1983b), and Ensor and Carlson (1988,
1989). As stated above, only a small portion of the project area is in Matagorda
County. This county is within the area known as the Southern Coastal Corridor
(Bailey1987), and it is depicted in Figure 5.
It is generally accepted by most archaeologists that Southeast Texas
prehistory is divided into three basic prehistoric periods: Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and
Late Prehistoric. Some archaeologists (Kotter 1981) believed that there was a
Formative Period that existed prior to Historic contact. More specific to the current
project area, however, is the chronology discussed by Ambler (1970:4-7). His
comments are inserted into the general chronology below.
Paleo-Indian Period
The common conception of the Paleo-Indian period is the time following the
last ice age (Pleistocene) in North America when man wandered about the
continent in pursuit of mega fauna such as mammoth, mastodon, and now-extinct
species of bison. Although not much is known about their diet, plants and other
smaller animals probably was as important to the Paleo-Indians as an occasional
mammoth or other large animal. Sites with in situ deposits dating to this period are
few in number in Southeast Texas. Paleo-Indians are also noted for the
manufacture of unique and distinctive projectile points. In Southeast Texas, a
variety of Paleo-Indian points have been found, with most of the specimens
obtained through surface collections. Two of the best known types associated with
this period in Southeast Texas are Clovis and Folsom. Descriptions of these and
other types discussed in this report are described in Turner and Hester (1985) and
Suhm and Jelks (1962). In Southeast Texas, the Paleo-Indian period is thought to
have lasted about 2000 years, from 10,000 B.C. to 8000 B.C. (Ensor 1991:8). No
sites dating to this period have been reported in the project area. Paleo-Indian
artifacts have been found at McFaddin Beach to the east in Jefferson County.

Archaic Period
The Archaic period is generally defined as the period following the extinction
of Pleistocene megafauna during which time small bands of hunters and gatherers
roamed the countryside in search of plants and animals. During this time the
overall population increased as evidenced by a greater number of sites. This
period is divided into the Early, Middle, and Late periods. According to Ambler
(1970:5), the term Archaic is used to refer to the pre-ceramic components found at
several sites in the Wallisville Reservoir area. Sites containing Archaic materials in
the Wallisville area are, according to Amber, few in number. Sites cannot be
classified simply on the basis of an absence of ceramics, because some shell
middens may lack artifacts completely, and the ceramics that were present on the
surface could have been taken from the site by collectors. Subsurface testing is
needed to make this determination. The presence of dart points at shell middens,
especially the Kent type, is an indicator of an Archaic occupation. No Archaic sites
have been reported in the current project area.
Late Prehistoric Period
This period, also referred to as the Neo-Archaic, is marked by the addition of
arrow points and the use of ceramics. Kotter (1981:33) believes few, if any,
changes in subsistence strategies occurred during this time. The association of
Gary points and ceramics strengthens his argument. No direct evidence of
horticulture is known from this region. Kotter also states that the Late Prehistoric
period probably continued to the time of Historic contact. Ensor (1991:8) separates
the Neo-Archaic into Early and Late Ceramic periods with the Early Ceramic Period
dating from A.D. 400 to A.D. 800, and the Late Ceramic Period dating from A.D.
800 to A.D. 1750. All of the prehistoric sites in the current project area have been
dated to the Late Prehistoric period because of the presence of ceramics and arrow
points, specifically the Perdiz type.
Formative Period
This stage is viewed by Kotter (1981:34) as a time when changes in social
and economic organization occurred. These changes were accompanied by a
dependence of agriculture. The presence of mound and village sites in the area
are viewed as evidence of this period. However, if agriculture was practiced in
the region it was probably not widespread. Sorrow and Cox (1973) believe that
evidence of this stage in the region may exist due to the large number of sites in
the Navasota River Basin containing ceramics. No Formative Period sites have
been reported in the current project area.

Historic Period
The following discussion came from the Handbook of Texas (bound copy),
the Handbook of Texas Online, searches by subject on the Internet (which
included local historic markers), and a contract report by Voellinger and Nash
(1989). The latter contains very detailed information regarding southern Brazoria
County and vicinity.
The first European contact with Indians in the region occurred in 1528
when members of the Narvaez Expedition found themselves stranded on an
island in the Gulf of Mexico off the Texas coast. From a journal kept by Cabeza
de Vaca, a survivor of that group, we have learned much of what we know about
the indigenous peoples of Southeast Texas. There was competition between the
Spanish and French for this part of Texas, and Spanish and French traders were
active on the lower Trinity River in the 1740s. The Orcoquisac Archeological
District in Chambers County contains sites representing Spanish and French
influence in the area. The French established a trading post for the purpose of
establishing commerce with the nearby Akokisa village of El Orcoquisac. The
post, referred to as Blancpain’s trading post (41CH57), is also the site of the first
location of Presidio San Agustin de Ahumada. In this district (in addition to
41CH57) there is a possible Indian rancheria (41CH22) that may be the Akokisa
village mentioned above, the second site of the Presidio San Agustin de
Ahumada established in 1766 (41CH53), and the site of Mission Nuestra Senora
de la Luz (41CH54), Other historic Indian groups in the area were the
Karankawa, Coapite, and Copane. They were present when the first expeditions
traveled the lower Trinity River. In the Wallisville area, evidence of the Akokisa is
limited to the Presidio San Agustin de Ahumada and from a few surveyed sites
(Ambler 1970:6-7). Historic Indian artifacts known from this period include sandtempered pottery and bone-tempered pottery (Orcoquizac Plain) as well as items
of European manufacture such as metal objects and glass beads. No historic
period Native American sites have been reported in the current project area.
The native Indian group known to inhabit the costal area was the
Karankawa. They were a coastal group had the reputation as fierce warriors.
First contact with this tribe was made by members of the Navarez Expedition in
1528. Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca and three of his companions, members of
this expedition, was captured by a Karankawa band. De Vaca lived among them
for eight years before returning to Mexico. He kept a journal that contains
valuable information about the daily life of these Indians. In 1685, the Karankawa
encountered the French when LaSalle landed at Matagorda Bay with 300
colonists; however, a local Karankawa band killed most of them.

13

In the early 1800s, Stephen F. Austin brought the first of his colonists to
the area where they landed at the mouth of the Brazos River. They were known
as the “Old Three Hundred” and settled along the alluvial bottomlands of the San
Bernard River and Jones Creek among other streams. Most of the settlers relied
on cotton and sugar to make a living and founded large plantations that relied on
slave labor. The earliest sugar plantation in the project area was Ellerslie
(41BO80), which was founded in 1824 (Leezer 2006:Table 2-1). Archival research
determined that it was in operation until 1900 when it was destroyed by a hurricane.
Ellerslie was followed by Peach Point, which was established in 1832 by James
Franklin Perry and his wife, Emily Austin Perry. Peach Point was used as a slave
plantation until 1863 with cotton and sugar cane the primary crops. According to the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the Gulf Prairie Cemetery was a pioneer cemetery
that was originally part of the Peach Point Plantation. It was used by descendents
of James Franklin Perry and his wife, Emily Austin Bryan Perry, Stephen F. Austin’s
sister, and by the community since 1829. Stephen F. Austin had a home in the
area and was buried at this cemetery in 1836. This is one of the cemeteries in the
Perry Ranch 3-D seismic survey area. When James Perry died in 1853, his wife
gave 200 acres of the original plantation to William Joel Bryan who made his home
there and developed a thriving cotton and cattle business known as the Duranzo
plantation (41BO136). During the early 20th century, the property was used to
graze cattle. Figure 6 depicts the site at the time of this survey.
The community of Jones Creek is located in the project area and was settled
in the 1820s by Anglo-American families including several of the “Old Three
Hundred” who established large cotton plantations in the area. The early settlers
had several clashes with local Karankawa bands. In 1824, the Battle of Jones
Creek was fought between the colonists of the lower Brazos River and the Indians
on the bank of what is now Jones Creek. The creek where the battle took place
and the nearby community took their names from Randal Jones, the leader of the
colonists in the battle with the Karankawa.
In 1832, the Mexican government organized a separate municipal district
and called it Brazoria. As a result, Brazoria became one of the original Texas
counties following Texas independence in 1836. The town of West Columbia in
west-central Brazoria County is the site of the first capital of Texas and dates to
pre-revolutionary days. Jones Creek ceased to grow following the end of plantation
life after the Civil War. Before the end of slavery after the end of the Civil War
agriculture, which depended on slave labor, was so important in the area that
Brazoria County was the wealthiest county in Texas. When slaves were no longer
available, the large plantations were divided into smaller farms. Some were
converted to pasture, and others became prison farms. Transportation of goods
along the coast and up the San Bernard River was a major part of the economy,
The presence of six shipwrecks in the project area and vicinity are a testimony to
the hazards of water travel. The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway was constructed in the
early 20th century and provided an alternate route of transportation in an east-west
direction across the southern portion of Brazoria County.

14

Figure 6. View of Duranzo Plantation Pasture
Jones Creek is the only named community in the Perry Ranch 3-D project
area. By 1949, it became important as one of several municipalities and towns
making up the Brazosport industrial and port area. In 1956, its population reached
2851 and had nine businesses. By 1957, the community included Perry’s Landing,
Peach Point, Peach Crest, and Gulf Park, a residential community established in
1927 by Robert E. L. Stringfellow and P. George Maercky. Jones Creek was
incorporated in 1970. Today, there is no major development in the low-lying
marshy areas of south Brazoria County within the project area, and much of this
region is only accessible by boat or helicopter.

15

Between 1861 and 1864, several Confederate fortifications and defensive
emplacements were erected at the mouth of the San Bernard River. In this area,
the shallow sandbar provided a natural naval defense, so the forts were designed
to defend against Union troops advancing up the coast on foot towards Velasco
rather than as protection against Federal gunboats that frequented the area
(Marchand 1864). In September of 1861, the area was protected by a small sand
fort with a 12-pounder cannon en barbette on the western bank of the river mouth
(Gadus and Freeman 2005:135). This structure was referred to as Fort San
Bernardo. In December of that year, the Union schooner Sam Houston, on patrol
off the Texas coast, reported a 24-pounder at the fort (Gadus and Freeman
2005:136). In 1863, the fortifications were reinforced, and construction of a second
earthwork on the east bank of the river below Jones Creek began. Although the
fort came under attack, construction continued and by January 15 of 1864, two new
gun platforms had been completed and a third begun (Gadus and Freeman
2005:141). A few days later, the fort was visited by Colonel Valery Sulakowski who
found problems with the fort’s construction, and he ordered it to be demolished and
replaced with another fort north of Jones Creek (Gadus and Freeman 2005:141).
Figure 7 depicts the extent of Confederate fortifications in the project area in 1863.
According to Doug Jones (personal communication, July 18, 2008), the northern
fort would have been located around the modern-day intersection of the river with
the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway.
The economy of the area following the war suffered greatly. The loss of
slaves was viewed by the plantation owners as a loss of wealth and property. In
addition, land values decreased because many of the landowners could not longer
farm their vast holdings. This loss of real estate assets resulted in debt for many of
the plantation owners (Fenneman 2004:102). According to Creighton (1975:257),
“A scarcity of consumer goods, the confiscation of cotton by the reconstruction
government, and the psychological toll of an uncertain future sent Brazoria County
into economic chaos.” In the period from the late 1870s through the 1880s, the
economy of the county improved as the per capita debt was less than half of the
average for the United States, and an influx of foreign immigrants and displaced
southerners increased the local population (Creighton 1975:272-272). Convict
labor was used to revive crop production and corn, grains, potatoes, fruits, wild
grapes, sugar, and cotton became major exports (Kleiner n.d.).

At the turn-of-the-century, Brazoria County tourism became an important
part of the local economy. Following the devastating hurricane of 1900, Mrs.
Josephine Thompson built a four-room house at the mouth of the San Bernard
River. It was sold to a Mrs. Cornett Ramsey in 1912, additions were made to the
original structure, and the building became a hotel. Overnight lodging and meals
were made available to tourists and fisherman. This structure is referred to by
some as the Johnston’s Beach Hotel. According to Gadus and Freeman (2005:91),
it was in operation until at least September of 1924. Photographs of the hotel are
found in the report by Hudson et al. (2008). Figure 8 depicts the location of the
hotel as shown on a United States Coast and Geologic Survey map dated 1934.
In 1902, oil was discovered in the area, and the local agricultural economy
was gradually supplanted by petroleum and mineral production. The first oil field
was at Kaiser Mound in West Columbia. In 1912, sulfur began to be mined (Kleiner
n.d.). According to Hudson et al. (2008), the major center of economic importance
shifted from the San Bernard River to Freeport. An examination of the river by the
USACE in 1919 (Baker 1919:2) reported that “there are no towns of any importance
along the river, and so far as known there is but one small launch engaged in
hauling freight.” At that time, all of the land adjacent to the river was devoted to
farming and raising cattle, and nearly all products were transported to market by
wagon or rail (Hudson et al. 2008:12). The Gulf Intracoastal Canal was built in
1913, and it connected the San Bernard River with the Brazos River. To the east, it
entered Galveston Bay, and to the west it entered Matagorda Bay. This artery
became the main means of transporting goods by water in the area, and (as a
result) most of the surrounding riverside settlements were bypassed (Hudson et al.
2008:12).

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL WORK
A search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas and the maps at TARL
and the THC revealed the presence of seven area archaeological surveys,
eighteen linear archaeological surveys, and two surveys that are area and linear
within the current project area. The only surveys that recorded sites were the
Seadock project (Research Staff 1974) and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway
project from the Brazos River floodgates to Port O’Connor by Prewitt and
Associates, Inc. (Gadus and Freeman 2005). The remaining surveys did not
record sites, are scattered across the project area, and vary in size from 15 acres
to 1010 acres. Most of these surveys were regulated by the Galveston District of
the USACE. Other agencies include the Department of Energy (DOE),
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Energy Regulatory Agency
(FERC), Rural Electrification Agency (REA), Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC),
and the United States Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS).
It should be stated here that many of the early surveys did not follow the
current survey methods, which are more precise and involve shovel testing in
most cases and backhoe trenching in some cases. Also, mapping technology is
much better now. Many of the earlier surveys were simply visual observations of
eroded areas and did not involve any subsurface investigation. The survey for
the Seaway Pipeline and Depot (Nightengale 1980) serves as an example of the
quality of work conducted in the past. The survey was not plotted on the Atlas,
and the only map found was drafted for the report on a Xerox copy of piecedtogether quadrangles that were copied as one map. This project area map is
very hard to read, and it was transposed in ArcView by scanning and linking
known points to the topographic quadrangles that formed the background. The
only subsurface investigation conducted was a series of probes along a ridge,
which they define as a high probability area. Since no definition of a probe is
given in the report, the reader does not know if probes are another way of
referring to shovel testing with screening. Also, the report does not give the
length and width of the pipeline and the dimensions for the depot. Also, some of
the reports documenting surveys are not available, and some of the surveys
were done in-house by archaeologists from the Galveston Corps. In many cases
there are no reports, only letters on file, which are not possible to find.
Twenty-five previously recorded archaeological sites in the general
seismic project area are plotted on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas and the
maps at TARL and the THC. The majority of the twenty-five sites (n=21) are
prehistoric shell middens located along the San Bernard River. The remaining
four sites are historic and consist of two plantations, a cemetery, and a 1930s era
house site.

20

Six shipwrecks are plotted on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas and on
the maps at the office of the State Marine Archeologist within the current seismic
project area. Although these ships sank in modern times, the actual age of these
vessels is not known. Each wreck has a number assigned by the THC, and this
number is mentioned in the nautical report (Volume II).
Five cemeteries are present within the project area. Three were labeled
on the topographic maps, and one is plotted on the Archeological Sites Atlas and
the maps at TARL as 41BO170. Two of the cemeteries have numbers assigned
by the THC, one was found by a visual inspection of the topographic
quadrangles, one was found by comparing church names to a list published by
the Brazoria County Cemetery Association which gives latitude and longitude
information, and one was plotted by a local informant. All five cemeteries are
reported on the list. The age of one cemetery was found during a review of a
contract report by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (Voellinger and Nash 1989),
but the specific age of the other three cemeteries is not known. Some, however,
are mentioned as being associated with historic plantations and communities.
Not one of these cemeteries will be affected by the proposed drilling.

21

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
This survey investigated 360 source point locations within the terrestrial
high probability areas. No archaeological sites were identified, and no artifacts
were collected. According to historical records, the Confederate fort and the 20th
century hotel were destroyed. No evidence of these two historic sites were found
during this survey. Source points at the Duranzo Plantation (41BO136), located
within a National Register District, were investigated. The plantation site is well
known, and it was buffered for avoidance. The proposed source points were
located in outlying plantation land, which were probably fields and pasture. The
drills to be employed in this area are listed as no/low impact vehicles; therefore,
no adverse impact to the area is anticipated. The nautical high probability area
was subjected to a magnetometer survey, and the results of this investigation are
reported in the PBS&J report (Volume II). A single grave was found at source
point 50181017. This grave is described and illustrated in Appendix III.

22

RECOMMENDATIONS
No prehistoric or historic sites were found during the archaeological
survey of high probability areas within the proposed 3-D seismic survey area. It
is, therefore, recommended that the seismic survey be allowed to proceed as
planned. The single historic grave must be avoided. Should, however, evidence
of a cultural resource site be encountered at any of the source points visited and
shovel tested during this study, all work must cease at the location until the
situation can be evaluated by the THC and the USACE. Also, if additional source
points within high probability areas are proposed, the THC and the USACE must
be notified in case additional survey by professional archaeologists is warranted.

APPENDIX III
HISTORIC GRAVE
On Friday, July 18, 2008, the Project Manager of the Perry Ranch 3-D
Seismic project reported to DESCO archaeologists that a grave marker had been
found near source point 50181017 which had recently been drilled. The area is
located in a cattle pasture and had recently been mowed prior to its discovery by
one of the seismic project workers who then notified the Project Manager. Drilling
activity in the area occurred before the grasses were mowed, and visibility was
minimal. The drilling activity occurred outside of a designated High Probability
Area and, therefore, was not investigated by an archaeologist prior to the drilling.
Archaeologist Phil Bishop visited the site of the grave. His findings are presented
below.
The site consists of an isolated grave marker and head stone located in a
frequently mowed pasture in Brazoria County, Texas (Figure 1). The head stone
of the grave marker has been displaced by agricultural activity, and it is unclear
whether the feature is in situ.
Grave Stone Inscription
ALCINDA BLUITT
809 1929
AT REST
This cultural feature/site consists of an isolated grave marker and a head
stone formed from a masonry block of caliche or dense sandstone. The
structural material was not acid tested or emulsified by the observer. The head
stone is a block of stone approximately 4 x 12 x 18 inches. A veneer of mortar
and shell had been applied, and the inscription was then stamped into the wet
coating. The grave marker base is slightly larger, and its thickness is unknown.
The head stone lies ten meters north of the fence line and ten meters east of the
source point. The base of the grave marker lies eight meters northwest of the
fence line and is aligned parallel and perpendicular to the old fence line. The
fence line is aligned roughly southwest to northeast, and both stone features are
north of the fence line in a freshly mowed pasture. The head stone has been
plow scarred (or nicked by the mower) and moved to the west two meters toward
the drilled source point. Tailings of drill activity were observed, and all were found
to be negative for bone or wood fragments. A field sketch map was made, and
photographs were taken of the gravesite and immediate area.

Figure 1. Headstone of Alcinda Bluitt

The surrounding area was investigated through pedestrian survey
techniques which consisted of 5-10 meter transects along an adjacent fence line
for more than 50 meters along an axis radiating from the site locus. Surface
visibility consisted of mown pasture grass at the time of discovery. A new source
point location was established and tested 220 feet south of the previous location.
The source point stake was moved the next day. Drill access will be buffered in
order to avoid any further disturbance in the vicinity. The old drill site containing a
charge of 5 pounds of pentolite will be abandoned at 100 feet below the surface
of the cattle pasture. The new source point location will be detonated 220 feet
south of the area beyond the buffer.
Landowner Interview:
Mr. Brown (owner of the area at the time) said he had seen the grave, but
he seemed disinterested. He claims it was “either dumped (there),” or it was a
slave grave. He had seen no other markers. He said the nearest Cemetery was
on the other side of the slough to the south, southeast. The early owners were
French settlers and slave owners. The land was the Cox Ranch, and it is now the
Poole Ranch.
