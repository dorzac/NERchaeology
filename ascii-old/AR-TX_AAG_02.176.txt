ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the 7.08 acre Sylvia Tucker Memorial Park was
conducted by American Archaeology Group LLC in December 2010. This project was
performed for the City of Kempner. This investigation was performed using the
pedestrian survey method supported by shovel probing and by subsurface mechanical
trenching. No archaeological sites were encountered during the course of this survey. It
is recommended that construction within the project area be allowed to proceed as
planned. Monitoring during construction by an archaeologist is not necessary.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Kempner, Texas, plans to construct additional trails and minimal
impact structures as a result of funding from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department on
the east side of the City of Kempner, Lampasas County, Texas (Figure 1). The project
area is depicted on the 7.5’ U.S.G.S. topographic quadrangle Copperas Cove dated 1995
(Figure 2). The Universal Transverse Mercator (U.T.M.) coordinates for the approximate
center of the tract are Zone 14 Northing 3438700 and Easting 596400. The park project
will entail sidewalks, play areas and several park structures with minimal subsurface
impacts. AAG surveyed the entire park to assist with park planning and attempt to locate
archaeological sites that might be present.
The project area is bounded by a cultivated field on the western border, and U.S.
Highway 190 on the south side, and a hill slope on the eastern boundary (Figure 3). The
closest water is Taylor Creek, which transects the project area. The topographic position
of the project area fluctuates from 860 to 900 feet in elevation above mean sea level.
Previous archaeological surveys in Lampasas County have identified significant
prehistoric and historic sites. Therefore, an archaeological survey was required by the
Texas Historical Commission, the lead review and compliance agency, before
construction of the park is allowed to proceed. In order to satisfy this requirement, the
City of Lampasas, Texas contracted with American Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G) to
perform this service. The project was conducted under the auspices of Antiquities Permit
number 5797.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
Lampasas County is included in the Balconian biotic province as described by Blair
(1950:112-116):
The Balconian province, as here defined, takes in most of the Edwards
Plateau as limited by Sellards, Adkins and Plummer (1933) the Lampasas
Cut Plain and the Comanche Plateau by Raisz (1946), and the Central
Mineral or Llano Uplift region. That part of the Edwards Plateau lying west
of the Pecos, and often referred to as the Stockton Plateau, is not included,
but is referred instead to as the Chihuahuan province.
Climate
The Balconian climate is characterized by a decrease in rainfall from east to west.
Coryell and Lampasas Counties are in the eastern half of the province, which has been
classified by Thornwaite (1948) as dry, sub humid, and mesothermal, with average annual
potential evapotranspiration of between 39.27 and 44.88 inches.
Vegetation
According to Blair (1950:113), the most characteristic plant association of this
province is a scrub forest of Mexican cedar (Juniperus asheii), Texas oak (Quercus texana),
stunted live oak (Quercus virginiana), and various less numerous species.
The project area is also located well within the Prairies Vegetation Region and the
Edwards Plateau Vegetation Region (Gould 1962). Plant species characteristic of the region
include Plateau live oak (quercus fusiformus), Texas oak (quercus texana), ashe juniper
(juniperus ashei), honey mesquite (prosopis glandulosa), cedar elm (ulmus crassifolia),
cottonwood (populus deltoides), pecan (carya illinoinensis), elm (ulmus spp.), sumacs (rhus
spp.), Texas persimmon (diospyros texana), agarita (berberis trifoliolata), Texas stillingia
(stillingia texana), yucca (yucca spp.), Texas prickly pear (opuntia lindheimeri), yaupon (ilex
vomitoria), and American beautyberry (callicarpa americana). Grasslands include seep
mulhy (muhlenbergia reverchnoii), Canadian wildrye (elymus canadensis), dichanthelium
(dichanthelium spp.), Texas grama (bouteloua rigidiseta), and red grama (bouteloua
hirsuta).
Hydrology
The project area is within the Brazos River drainage basin. The Brazos is one of the
most extensive rivers in the state. The major drainage closest to the project area is Taylor
Creek which flows into the Lampasas River, now a part of Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir.
Wildlife

5

The Balconian Biotic Province generally contains a mixture of fauna from several
surrounding provinces (Blair 1950). Typical species found within the project area include
white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus), cotton-tailed rabbit (sylvilagus floridanus), ninebanded armadillo (dasypus novemcinctus), black-tailed jack rabbit (lepus californicus),
raccoon (prycon lotor), hispid cotton rat (sigmodon hispidus), wild turkey (melagris
gallopavo), morning dove (zenaida macroura), scissor-tailed flycatcher (tyrannus
forficatus), northern bobwhite (colinus virginianus), western coachwhip (masticophis
flagellum testaceus), and the bullsnake (pituophis melanoleucus sayi).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Lampasas County is located in the North Central Texas cultural-geographical
region as defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:76). This area is referred to as Central Texas
by most archaeologists and is rich archaeological sites.
Summaries relevant to the prehistory of Lampasas County and vicinity have
prepared by various archaeologists, primarily as a result of work at the Fort Hood
Military Installation (Guderjan et al. 1980; Skinner et al. 1981; Thomas 1978; Roemer et
al. 1985; Carlson et al. 1986), Belton Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964), the Youngsport site
(Shafer1963), and Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964, Sorrow et al. 1967).
Suhm (1960), Weir (1976), and Prewitt (1981, 1985) have published summaries of the
region. Most recently, two thorough articles concerning Central Texas were published in
Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society. These works, entitled
“Forty Years of Archaeology in Central Texas,” by Michael B. Collins (1995) and
“Implications of Environmental Diversity in the central Texas Archaeological Region”
by Linda Wootan Ellis, G. Lain Ellis, and Charles D. Frederick (1995), represent a major
synthesis of the vast amount of collected data for the region. The following discussion is
taken primarily from the works cited above.
Paleoindian Period
Although according to Willey and Phillips (1958:80), problems exist with the
term “Paleoindian,” it is so widely accepted that it is used in this discussion. Paleoindian
typically refers to those cultures that were oriented toward big game procurement
adaptation. Collins (1995:381) argues that subsistence in Clovis times, for example,
Paleoindian exploited a diverse fauna base that not only included large herbivores such as
mammoth, bison, and horse but also included smaller animals such as turtles, land
tortoises, alligators, mice badger, and raccoon. At Kincaid Rockshelter, paved floor
suggests that the inhabitants of this site returned to the same site as part of a regular
hunting and gathering strategy in contrast with nomadic hunters who only pursued big
game. It is, therefore, assumed that an array of plants presumably also constituted part of
Clovis subsistence (Collins 1990; Collins et al. 1989)
According to Skinner et al. (1981:13), the Paleoindian period is one of the least
understood times periods in Central Texas prehistory, primarily because few sites have
been excavated. Evidence of this period often occurs in the form of surface collected
materials found over much of Central Texas. At Fort hood, this period is represented by
distinctive projectile points found in multicomponent surface sites and as isolated finds
(Carlson et al. 1986:125). Generally, it is believed that this period lasted from about
10,000 B.C. until 6000 B.C. Diagnostic artifacts of the period include dart types
Angostura, Clovis, Folsom, Golondrina, and Plainview as defined by Suhm and Jelks
(1962) and Turner and Hester (1985).

These early sites are often found on old terraces of major river drainages and may
be more distant from major streams than some more recent occupations (Bryan 1931).
Some rockshelters, such as the Levi site, were intensively occupied even though they are
located a considerable distance from major rivers. The only example of a rockshelter in
Central Texas immediately adjacent to a major drainage known to contain Paleoindian
occupation is the Horn Shelter (41BQ46) in Bosque County (Redder 1985)
Archaic Period
The Archaic represents a board cultural time period that lasted from
approximately 8500 Before Present (B.P.) to 1250 B.P. in Central Texas. According to
Prewitt (1981:71), “The Archaic Stage dominates all other remains in Central Texas.”
Prewitt (1981) has subdivided the Archaic into eleven phases. LeRoy Johnson (1987)
has questioned the validity of the phase concept as used by Prewitt, especially the phases
occurring before the Middle Archaic. Carlson et al. (1986:15) has grouped these into
Early, Middle, Late and Terminal Periods.
According to Prewitt (1981:77-78), during the Early Archaic there was a “strong
orientation toward the gathering aspect rather than the hunting, and a mobile population
was of low density.” This occurred during the Circleville, San Geronimo, and Jarrell
phases (8500 B.P.- 5000 B.P.). In the Middle Archaic, food gathering had become very
specialized as evidenced by the presence of numerous burned rock middens/mounds
(Prewitt 1981:78-80). The Middle Archaic is seen by Prewitt to have taken place during
Oakalla, Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, and Round Rock phases (5000B.P. - 2600 B.P.). An
Overall decreases in burned rock middens took place during the Late Archaic. Bison
were important as a food resource, but did not dominate subsistence activities (Prewitt
1981:80-81). The Late Archaic occurred during the San Marcos and Uvalde phases
(2600 B.P. - 1750 B.P.). The terminal Archaic, according to the classification by Carlson
et al. (1986), includes the Twin Sisters and Driftwood phases (1750 B.P. -1250 B.P.). An
increase in the importance of gathering and an apparent peak in site density seems to
have occurred during Prewitt’s (1981:82) Driftwood phase.
Late Prehistoric Period
This period has been referred by some as the Neo-American Stage (Suhm et al.
1954) and the Post-Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994). Technological changes are the
primary distinguishing characteristic of this stage. The Austin (1250 B.P.- 650 B.P.) and
Toyah (650 B.P. - 200 B.P.) phases belong to this stage of prehistory. During this time
arrow points first appeared as well as ceramics and possibly horticulture.
According to Collins (1995:385), there is now evidence that the bow and arrow
appeared initially in Central Texas; pottery was added later, and agriculture developed
last and was of minor importance. Because Late Prehistoric groups continued to practice
hunting and gathering, a division or two sub-periods seem to have taken place. These are
referred to as early and late by Collins (1995:385) with the break between the long-

8

standing Archaic period and the Late Prehistoric period occurring at circa 800 B.P. when
Toyah replaced Austin as the prevailing archaeological information.
The most obvious changes that emerged at the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
period is the introduction of the bow and arrow and decreased use of the atlatl or spear
thrower. Otherwise, subsistence life ways in the Late Prehistoric were probably little
different from those in the earlier Archaic period (Prewitt 1981:74; Weir 1976). A
chronological model by Dillehay (1974) of bison presence and absence periods on the
southern plains suggests that bison were present in Central Texas during the Toyah phase
but not during the preceding Austin phase.
Historic Period
Collins (1995:386) divides the historic period of Central Texas into three subperiods: early, middle, and late. During the first two, vestiges of both indigenous and
European peoples and cultures were present; however, in the third the indigenous peoples
had virtually disappeared. The early historic sub-period in Central Texas began in the
late 17th century with the first documented arrival of Europeans. Lampasas County is
situated within the historic range of the Tonkawa Indians who inhabited the area in the
16th Century (Newcomb 1986). By the 19th century, they had broken ties with the
Comanche and Wichita and were associated with the Lipan Apache (Aten 1983:32).
They have been described as typical southern Plains Indians who were hunters and
gathers and who lived along the streams and rivers of Central Texas. Remains of this
group have not been found in an historic context in Lampasas County.
During this period, Texas was occupied by numerous aboriginal groups including
the Caddo, Jumano, Tonkawa, Comanche, and Lipan Apache (Newcomb 1986). Trade is
known to have existed between the Jumanos and the Caddos. The Lipan Apaches and
subsequently the Comanches entered the region from the Plains while following key
animals resources as they migrated into Texas. Contact peered occupations are often
identified by the occurrences of glass beads, gun parts, gunflints, metal projectile points,
and European manufactured ceramics. The archival search did not locate any Historic
Indian sites in Lampasas County. In adjacent Coryell County. A blue glass bead was
found with one of the burials at 41CV1, a group burial along the Leon River (Jackson
1931), and a steel arrow point has been reported as an isolated find on Horse Creek in the
extreme east corner of Coryell County (Campbell 1952).
In February 1856, the Texas Legislature created the County of Lampasas out of
the Milam-Bell-Coryell County area to the east and the Bastrop-Travis County area to the
west. By March 10, the county was officially organized and its government was in
business (Elzner 1974:20-22).
In the early years of settlement of Lampasas County, incidents between Indians
and Anglo settlers were common. First permanent settler Moses Hughes reported “In
1857 the Indians became very troublesome, killing people and stealing horses and
making depredations until 1866 or 1867” (Elzner 1974:76).

Official U.S. Census records do not record a population for Lampasas County in
1850. In 1860, the population of Lampasas County was 1,028. It rose slightly during the
tumultuous Civil War and Reconstruction years to 1,344 by 1870. During Post-Bellum
industrialization and tenant farm transition, the population exploded to 5,421 in 1880, the
highest rate of increase over a 10-year period in Lampasas County. The population
continued to increase but at a slightly lower rate, being 7,584 in 1890, 8,625 in 1900, and
9,532 in 1910. From 1920 to 1980, the population levels declined, but they have risen
slightly during the past 18 years (The Dallas Morning News, Inc. 1993: 333).
The frontier moved westward, leaving in its wake a growing population and
farming area in western central Texas. Moses Hughes built the first mill on the north
bank of Sulphur Creek in the middle 1850’s. In 1873, John Casbeer, Sr. built a mill
which became Lampasas’ most active processing plant after the Donovan family assumed
ownership in 1876. This father-son team ran the mill at a greater output and
improvement until the early 1920’s. Two additional mills served the agricultural needs
of central and eastern Lampasas County before the turn of the 20th century. The
Chadwick mill served the processing needs of our project area from 1874 to 1915. The
services of cotton ginning, flour milling, and sawing lumber were provided at this mill
(Elzner 1974:135-136).
The project area is located in eastern Lampasas County. In the late 1850’s, a
number of families named Pickett were land and slave owners of prominence until after
the Civil War (Elzner 1974:287). This area was often referred to as Pickett Valley. In
1854, Mr. Dan W. Taylor moved to this area from Falls County with a substantial herd of
cattle. He established a store for his workers and it was called “Taylor Creek Store” and
the first post office was also housed in this building (Elzner 1974:287). The building is
still standing and located several hundred feet to the northwest of the project area. The
community used that name until 1872.
Mr. Taylor became the first judge in Lampasas County and died in 1872 while on
his way to Kansas to sell a herd of cattle. At some point, Judge Taylor had been on a hog
hunt with his son Harry and they encountered Indians in the area. Judge Taylor was shot
in the hand by an arrow and survived but Harry’s horse had also been shot.
The Santa Fe Railroad came within two miles of Taylor’s Store and later a
community developed and was named Kempner, after a Santa Fe Railroad official
(Elzner 1974:288).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
In the site files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin are
numerous pieces of correspondence from landowners and artifact collectors documenting
and describing sites and artifacts found in Lampasas County. Also present are copies of
unpublished manuscripts, some of which do not provide information concerning author
and date of preparation.
At the time of this survey there were no archaeological sites recorded in the
project area. Bradle et al. (2004) conducted an archaeological survey of approximately
220 acres for the proposed Ogletree Preserve in 2002, approximately 3.5 kilometers east
of the current project area. This project was performed for the City of Copperas Cove
and three (3) archaeological sites (41CV273, 41CV1632, and 41LM45) were recorded.
41CV273 was recorded as a historic building built in 1878 and was used as a stagecoach
stop, store, and post office. There was a historic cut limestone-lined well in the valley
floor. This site is in excellent condition. This site is on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) and designated as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). Site
41CV1632 was recorded as a historic farmstead that has been severely impacted and the
only remaining feature was a pole barn in bad condition. This site was not considered
eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or worthy of
designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). Site 41LM45 was recorded as a
large lithic procurement/workshop site that is located along the Ogletree Gap hilltop and
slopes of the canyon. This site is primarily restricted to the surface with some possible
mixing in with colluvial shallow deposits. This site is not considered eligible for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or worthy of designation as
a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
Lampasas County contains numerous prehistoric and historic sites, many
potentially eligible for the National Register of Historic Places or as State Archaeological
Landmarks. Albert Field (1956:161-184) reported on a number of important sites within
the county. 41LM9 is the closest previously recorded archaeological site that was
recorded by the author in 1988 as a late prehistoric cemetery from the Toyah Phase. It is
located south of the project area where more expansive terraces are formed along Taylor
Creek. In 1977, TXDOT conducted a survey that purportedly covered the project area
and no sites were recorded from that survey. However, certain sections of the county
have not been adequately investigated. The current project area falls within this
category. There is reason to believe that large number of unrecorded sites exist along the
major streams of this area in the form of surface sites, possible rockshelters sites, and
buried sites.

11

FIELD METHODS
Background Research
Before entering the field, a background investigation was conducted. Site records
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas were checked
for previously recorded sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, site reports
documenting work in the region were examined for information concerning
archaeological surveys and other work relevant to the project area. The project was
discussed with representatives of the City of Kempner to ensure that the field crew was
aware of the correct boundaries of the proposed park project.
Field Survey
The fieldwork was accomplished using the pedestrian survey method supported
by shovel probing and backhoe trenching. Surface visibility was excellent over much of
the project area, especially the southern half. The excellent ground surface exposure is
due to the presence of shallow soils created by severe erosion and intensive farming
activities over the years and more recent brush removal and park construction. In addition
to surface inspection, 6 shovel probes and 4 mechanical backhoe trenches were excavated
(Figures 3 and 4). Sample matrix from the backhoe trenches were screened using onequarter inch hardware cloth. A mechanical trenching log (Appendix I) documented the
subsurface testing. Shovel probes were placed in disturbed areas where structures and
sidewalks existed and the backhoe trenches were placed in the only intact areas of soil
where no structures, parking lots or side walks existed. The western half of the project
area is developed park area.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
The site records at TARL revealed no sites had been recorded in the project area.
Large scale federal projects such as Belton Reservoir, Stillhouse Reservoir, and Fort
Hood have recorded the vast majority of sites in the region. The Copperas Cove USGS
Quadrangle (1995) was reviewed and no structures were depicted.
Field Survey
The field survey did not identify any prehistoric or historic sites within the project
area. Overall, the area is very disturbed from past land clearing and park construction and
contains shallow soils in many places on top of cemented limestone (Figure 5). Should
any sites be present, the possibility for significant research potential is considered low.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The current survey of the proposed City of Kempner Sylvia Tucker Memorial
Park in Lampasas County, Texas performed for the City of Kempner did not identify any
archaeological sites in the project area. American Archaeology Group LLC recommends
that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always possible that buried
cultural materials can be missed during any Phase I survey. Therefore, should any sites
be located during the construction of this sewer line, all work within the site should cease
until the situation can be evaluated by the Archeology Department, Texas Historical
Commission, in consultation with American Archaeology Group LLC and the City of
Kempner.
