Management Summary
BIO-WEST, Inc. conducted a magnetometer survey of a previously recorded magnetic anomaly,
designated Anomaly 366, in Sabine River near Orange, Texas on November 2, 2009. Work was
conducted to assist the Orange County Navigation and Port District (District) meet its obligation
under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The District proposes to construct a
marine terminal consisting of three 12-x-60-foot (ft) (3.7-x18-meter [m]) access ramps, each with a 20x-30-ft (6.1-x-9.1-m) metal dock, and one 32-x-295-ft (9.8-x-90-m) access ramp with two 20-x-30-ft
(6.1-x-9.1-m) metal docks. Each access ramp will be lined with a sheet pile bulkhead. Construction of
the terminal requires the placement of fill material into the river over an approximate 0.2-acre (0.08
hectare) area. Additionally, the terminal will include two mooring pilings.
Anomaly 366 was first recorded in 2000, identified as a potential submerged cultural resource,
and recommended for additional archaeological research and investigation (Enright and Watts 2002).
The Orange County Navigation and Port District reported to BIO-WEST on October 8, 2009 that the
area around Anomaly 366 had been dredged and that the source of the anomaly had likely been
removed. Dredging was conducted under a dredging permit and extension approved by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Galveston District (Appendix A). During the dredging, it was reported that a
World War II era round of ammunition was discovered and was believed to have been the source of
Anomaly 366 (Appendix B). BIO-WEST was subcontracted through LEAP Engineering, LLC to
conduct a magnetometer survey, at the recommendation of the Texas Historical Commission, in order
to verify the removal of the anomaly source.

Study Area
The area investigated was confined to the previously recorded magnetic anomaly, designated
Anomaly 366, and the immediate surrounding area (Figure 1). This location is in the Sabine River near
Orange, Texas within Berwick Cut and northeast of the municipal wharf.

Research Design
Equipment for the survey included a Trimble™ AgGPS132® differentially corrected global
positioning system (GPS) receiver and a Marine Magnetics Explorer magnetometer.

Trimble’s

HYDROpro™ navigation software guided the survey along preplanned survey transects and provided
data logging services. BIO-WEST surveyed three transects spaced 33 ft (10 m) apart through the
location of the original anomaly (approximately 90 x 160 ft [27 x 49 m]), four transects outside of the
original location, and six perpendicular transects. Positional and magnetic data were collected at a rate
of 1 reading per second. Vessel speed during the survey averaged 3.0 knots, providing in-line data
spacing of approximately 5.0 ft (1.5 m). BIO-WEST processed the raw magnetic data into a contour
map (Figure 2). The process involved filtering the data through a mathematical algorithm to remove the
diurnal variation, creating a regularly spaced grid of the irregularly spaced data points, and generating
contours that are both visually concise and that accurately represent anomalies in the earth’s magnetic
field. The contour map was created utilizing Golden Software, Inc.’s Surfer® contouring and 3D surface
mapping software. Contour interval was set at 5 gammas (γ) with 100-γ index contours. The contours

illustrated in Figure 2 present 5-γ positive contours as orange and negative contours as light blue. Index
contours are illustrated in red (positive) and dark blue (negative).

Results
A relatively large amount of shoreline debris (Figures 3-8) resulted in corresponding anomalies
to the north and northwest. At the time of survey, a floating dry dock and barge (Figure 9) were
moored adjacent to the survey area to the northeast, which influenced magnetic readings throughout
the entire project site. This resulted in a gradual drop in magnetic values from southwest to northeast
as distance from the structures decreased. Comparing BIO- WEST’s magnetic contour map with that
from the original 2000 survey (Figure 10) illustrates that Anomaly 366 no longer exists (i.e. the source
has been removed).

The artillery shell pictured in the police report (Appendix B) appears to be a 155 mm modern
howitzer projectile fixed with a rotating band. The modern 155 mm projectile was constructed with a
forged steel body and steel base cover. It is possible that this compact source with its thick-walled steel
body was the source of Anomaly 366.

Recommendations
BIO-WEST recommends cultural resources clearance for the Anomaly 366 location.

The

magnetometer survey has verified that the source is no longer extant. Should unanticipated finds occur
during construction, BIO-WEST recommends that work cease immediately and the project sponsor
contact the State Marine Archeologist.
