Abstract
In November of 2013, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) carried out an intensive
archaeological investigation for the proposed Liberty Boulevard (Blvd) improvement project
in Penitas, Hidalgo County, Texas (CSJ# 0921-02-194 and 0921-02-904). The proposed project
extends from US 83 to Farm-to-Market 2221 and entails the widening of existing roadway, as
well as the construction of new location roadway along a portion of the proposed alignment.
The total project length is approximately 6.1 miles or about 70 acres, of which 49.6 acres
is proposed additional Right-of-Way (ROW). AmaTerra conducted the archaeological survey
under Texas Antiquities Permit 6716.
Archaeological investigations involved thorough pedestrian survey and the excavation of
76 shovel tests throughout the Area of Potential Effect (APE) where right-of-entry (ROE)
to private properties was available. One archaeological site, 41HG248, was identified and
recorded during field investigations. Located within a plowed field, the site consists of lithic
debitage, tools, and a scatter of burned rock representing the disturbed remains of a prehistoric
campsite. AmaTerra recommends that Site 41HG248 is not eligible for listing as a State
Antiquities Landmark or in the National Register of Historic Places. Based on the results of
field investigations, no additional archaeological investigations within the proposed APE are
warranted at this time. No artifacts were collected during this survey.

Chapter 1

Introduction
In November 2013, AmaTerra conducted an archaeological survey in advance of the proposed
construction of Liberty Boulevard (Blvd) in Hidalgo County, Texas (CSJ #0921-02-194 and
0921-02-904). The project area extends approximately 6.1 miles from US Highway 83 in
Penitas to Farm-to-Market (FM) 2221 and will involve the expansion of existing roadway, as
well as construction of new location roadway (Figure 1).
At present, Liberty Blvd consists of four 12-foot wide travel lanes with a 16-foot turn lane
within an existing 120-foot wide county ROW, from US 83 to 0.2 miles north of Diamond
Avenue (Ave), for a total length of 0.5 miles. Half a mile to the north, the road resumes as a
two-track dirt road between Marble Street (St) and Volcano Ave (0.7 miles). A half mile to the
north, Liberty Blvd starts again as a two lane road extending from Pino St to 0.3 miles north
of Blue Jay Ave ending with a segment length of 1.7 miles. The last 2.4 miles of the proposed
route of Liberty Blvd consists of plowed fields and natural gas/oil gravel road access ways. The
proposed roadway from US 83 to Three Mile Road would include a five-lane urban roadway
consisting of a 14-foot wide continuous center turning lane, two 12-foot wide inside lanes, and
two 14-foot wide outside shared use lanes within a 120-foot ROW. From Three Mile Road to
FM 2221, the improvements would include a two-lane rural roadway consisting of two 12-foot
wide travel lanes and two 10-foot wide shoulders within a variable 30 to 80 foot ROW.
The APE for archaeological resources is defined as the footprint of the proposed undertaking
to the maximum depth of impact, including all easements, and project specific locations. Thus,
the APE for archaeological resources will cover a total distance of approximately 6.1 miles or
approximately 70 acres, 49.6 acres of which is proposed additional ROW. The project will be
constructed at grade and therefore the maximum depth of impact will be four feet or less, with
the exception of the two canal crossings, where new piers would reach a depth exceeding 25
feet below the surface.
The project is being funded by Hidalgo County in cooperation with the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT), using federal transportation funds. TxDOT is reviewing the
Environmental document being prepared for compliance with the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA). Since the project is being built with federal transportation money on land
owned or controlled by the State of the Texas, the project also falls under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (Section 106) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
Therefore, AmaTerra’s work conformed to the guidelines under 36 CFR 800 and 13 TAC 26
which outline the regulations for implementing Section 106 and the ACT.
The proposed roadway would be built on existing publicly owned land, as well as private
property. AmaTerra had access to approximately 75 percent of the total APE at the time of
survey. Private properties not accessible due to a lack of right of entry were visually inspected
from existing ROW and fence lines. The survey included pedestrian survey and shovel testing

of all portions of the APE where access was available. Investigators excavated 76 shovel tests
and documented one new archaeological site, 41HG248. Site 41HG248 is a former prehistoric
campsite observed within a plowed field. Due to extensive plowing, the site has lost all integrity.
Site 41HG248 is characterized by a surficial scatter of lithic debitage, stone tools, and burned
rock within a plowed field. An intact hearth was likely present at one time; however, today there
remains no intact features, or patterning to the observed archaeological materials. AmaTerra
recommends that Site 41HG248 is not eligible for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark
(SAL) or in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). No additional archaeological
work is recommended for any of the APE.
Field investigations were conducted November 19-22, 2013 under Antiquities Permit No. 6716.
Rachel Feit acted as Principal Investigator and was assisted by Mason Miller, Bruce Darnell,
and Travis Cornish. A total of 120 person hours were expended in the field in support of this
project. Weather was unseasonably warm, though investigators encountered no difficulties in
completing investigations.
This report is divided into six chapters. The project setting and cultural overview are discussed
in Chapters 2 and 3. Chapter 4 includes the field methodology implemented during the project
and the results of field investigations are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 presents the
summary and recommendations.

Project Background
Environmental Setting
According to Griffith and Omernik (2013) the project area is situated within the Western Gulf
Coastal Plains ecoregion. More specifically, the project area falls within the Lower Rio Grande
alluvial floodplain. This region is characterized by relatively flat topography composed of
Holocene-age alluvial sands and clays derived from the Rio Grande floodplain. Grasslands
once dominated this flat topography; however, today the region has been altered by residential,
industrial, and agricultural land use practices (Figure 2.). The project APE is gently sloping
with terrain ranging from approximately 160 feet (ft) above mean sea level (amsl) to 230 ft
amsl. Approximately 90 percent of the project area exhibited good surface visibility at the time
of survey.

Figure 2. Typical view of the project area.

Historic native flora is characterized by savannah-type grassland vegetation with intermittent
floodplain forests. Grasses common to the region include Seacoast Bluestem (Schizachyrium
scoparium var. littoralis), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), switch grass (Panicum virgatum),
and sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula var. curtipendula). Trees include live oak (Quercus
fusiformis), mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), Texas palmetto (Sabal mexicana), Texas ebony
(Pithecellobium flexicaule), and sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata) (Gould 1978; Simpson
1999; Stahl and McElvaney 2003). In fact, Spanish explorers once referred to this region
as “Rio de las Palmas” for the large palm trees which adorned the floodplain ridges during
historic times. Fauna, once native to the region, included bison (Bison bison), pronghorn
antelope (Antilocapra americana), bear, wolf, and jaguar (Hester 2004). The regional climate
is characterized as subtropical. Annually, the project area receives 17 to 24 inches of rain and
has a mean annual air temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit (USDA-NRCS 2013).

By the early 1900s most of this natural vegetation had been removed in favor of suitable
cropland. Today, the area remains heavily utilized for agricultural purposes with most land
devoted to cotton, grain, citrus, sorghum, sugar cane, vegetable, and melon production. In
order to support these agricultural endeavors, the area is interlaced by a network of man-made
irrigation canals. The closest natural source of fresh water is the Rio Grande River, located
approximately one mile south of the APE. This reliance on the Rio Grande River for both
agricultural and residential uses has drastically reduced the river’s flow upon reaching the Gulf
of Mexico.
The underlying geology of the APE is characterized by Quaternary-age deposits associated
with both the Lissie (Ql) and Goliad Formation (Pg) (BEG 1992). The soils within this region
are described as Mollisols composed primarily of deep clay and sandy clay loams (Griffith and
Omernik 2013). According to the United States Department of Agriculture-National Resources
Conservation Service (2013), soils within the APE consist of Brennan, Hidalgo, McAllen
series sandy loams, the Randado-Cuevitas Complex, and Hidalgo, Ramadero and Rio series
clay loams. These sediments are derived from eolian sands over calcareous loamy alluvium
and clayey alluvium (Table 1; USDA-NRCS 2013). Soils are described as having zero to
one percent slopes and extend to a depth of over 80 inches below the surface. Currently, the
APE is dominated by mixed land use consisting of agricultural fields, suburban development,
and oil/gas wells. As a result of land use practices, the APE has been subjected to numerous
disturbances including, but not limited to, irrigation and drainage trenching, land leveling, and
plowing.

Regional Chronology And
Cultural Background
The project area is situated within the South Texas archaeological region (Perttula 2004).
Dating and interpretation of South Texas prehistory is rather difficult due to land modifications
and extensive artifact collecting (Hester 1981:119, 128; 2004). Therefore, this culture history
will be supplemented by data acquired from neighboring archaeological regions: Lower Pecos,
Central Texas, Coastal Texas, and Northern Mexico. Human presence in South Texas can be
divided into Prehistoric and Historic stages. Three major intervals or periods are identified in
the Prehistoric stage: the Paleoindian, the Archaic, and the Late Prehistoric.

Paleoindian
The arrival of humans in the New World occurred during the Paleoindian period, which dates
from 11,500 to 8800 BP (Collins 1995). As the Pleistocene ended, diagnostic Paleoindian
materials in the form of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview projectile points began to enter the
archaeological record. These points were lanceolate-shaped and fluted for hafting to wooden
spears. Using the launching momentum from atlatls (spear-throwers), large game such as
mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and horse were frequently taken (Black 1989). In addition
to megafauna, Paleoindian groups likely harvested less daunting prey such as antelope, turtle,
and frogs. Stylistic changes in projectile point technology occurred during this later portion of
the period, eventually shifting to Dalton, Scottsbluff, and Golondrina traditions. Environmental
studies suggest that Late Pleistocene climates were wetter and cooler (Mauldin and Nickels
2001; Toomey et al. 1993), gradually shifting to drier and warmer conditions during the Early
Holocene (Bousman 1998). The end of the Pleistocene was likely arid to semiarid, and prickly
pear and agave populations were high (Bousman et al. 1990:94, 98). As megafauna gradually
died off during the shift to warmer climates, subsistence patterns shifted toward smaller game
and plant foraging. Intact Paleoindian occupations in the Lower Rio Grande Valley are largely
unknown, and diagnostic Paleoindian points are typically limited to surface finds.

Archaic
The Archaic period is typically divided in three smaller subperiods: Early, Middle and Late.
The entire Archaic period broadly dates to 8800–800 BP, and is characterized by a wider
variety of plant and animal exploitation with a slight decrease in group mobility (Black 1989).
The number of recorded Early Archaic sites in the Lower Rio Grande Valley is extremely low
and this subperiod within the Gulf Coastal Plain is still poorly understood. Surface finds have
yielded some unstemmed triangular bifaces, gouges, and stemmed dart points in this area (Hall
et al. 1986:17–18). In general researchers believe that Early Archaic lifeways along the Gulf
Coastal Plain followed the same pattern as those of people who lived farther inland. This

includes increased use of rock-lined hearths coupled with exploitation of marine and terrestrial
resources.
During the Middle Archaic period, which lasted roughly from 4500 BC to 2400 BC, prehistoric
populations appear to have dramatically increased, evidenced by the increased number of known
sites dating to this period. The Middle Archaic period broadly marks an expansion of lithic
technology and a more intensive utilization of plant based resources (Black 1989). Sites occur
in a wider variety of settings—flood plains, upland terraces, upland plains. Typical artifacts
include groundstone, unstemmed triangular points, and gouges (Hester 2004). Projectile point
types of this period include Tortuga, Abasolo, Carrizo and Bulverde. Cemeteries also begin to
appear during this subperiod, suggesting increased territorialism (Taylor and Highley 1995).
The Late Archaic subperiod begins around 2400 BC and is defined by a continuation of trends
began during the Middle Archaic. Cemeteries become more common and larger, especially
around the Gulf Coast region. The increased frequency in unstemmed dart points such as
Matamoros and Catan generally characterizes lithic assemblages of this period (Hester 1995).

Late Prehistoric
The commonly held date for the beginning of this interval is 800 BP, with a hallmark transition
to the bow and arrow (Hester 1981:122). This technology enabled prehistoric hunters to harvest
prey from greater distances with a lesser need for brushless, wide open spaces required for atlatl
maneuverability. The use of arrows is indicated by smaller-sized, triangular projectile points. A
turning point in the Late Prehistoric period of the northern South Texas Plain and Central Texas
is the first substantial presence of pottery (Black 1989; Story 1985). Typical artifact assemblages
from sites of this period include shell beads and gorgets, triangular points, and ceramics similar
to Huastecan pottery (Panuco V and VI periods) (MacNeish 1958:189). Assemblages and site
types suggest an increase in mobility during this period, with native peoples relying heavily on
bison, deer and antelope (Black 1989). Projectile points associated with the Late Prehistoric
period can include Matamoros, Fresnos, Starr and Cameron. However, researchers often have
difficulty in isolating the chronological relationships for this period in large part due to sites
existing in disturbed or deflated contexts (Collins, Hester and Weir 1969).

Historic
Local tradition suggests that Penitas was founded during the sixteenth century by survivors of
the Panfilo de Navarez expedition who befriended Calero Indians living along the Rio Grande
(Garza 2013). Late seventeenth century accounts describe Native Americans along the Rio
Grande as family units of hunter gatherers that resided near streams and springs whose camps
were revisited on a seasonal basis, allowing interaction with different groups along the way,
as well as the hunting of various large game (Campbell 1983:349–351). Spanish interest in
the Lower Rio Grande Valley gradually waned for a hundred years due to discouraging survey
reports on surrounding areas (Weddle 1992). However, in response to the continuous threat

of Apache and Comanche raiders, as well as the French incursion into East Texas, a series of
Spanish missions and presidios were erected across Texas during the eighteenth century.
Spanish Colonial administrators intended this region to serve as a sort of buffer colony to
maintain the northern line of New Spain. A frontera of ranches, forts, and municipalities was
instituted in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas in 1747 when Don Jose De Escandón,
the Count of Sierra Gorda, was commissioned to this region (Boyd et al. 1994:11). José de
Escandón established colonies in four areas on the southern banks of the Rio Grande: Reynosa
(south of Penitas), Camargo, Mier, and Revilla, all located on the south side of the river. The
inhabitants of both sides of the Rio Grande were granted large, linear tracts of land, each
containing a small section of valuable river frontage. The areas closest to the river were utilized
for farming, while the semi-arid scrubland farther away from it was used for large-scale cattle
ranching (Hill 1926; Jones 1979). Flooding, however, drove the settlers to a higher location
downstream and the ranch lands at Penitas remained lightly settled.
By 1850, however, hundreds of ranches operated along the Rio Grande by the 1830s, which
laid the tracks for the future American beef and wool industries. Penitas became a stop on the
Sam Fordyce Branch of the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico Railway (SLB&M) in 1904
as it built westward in the early years of the twentieth century. A school opened in 1907, and
a post office in 1909 (Garza 2013). The local community with a population of approximately
100 people in 1925, however, never grew to any significant size.
Industry relied primarily on ranching and small-scale agriculture throughout the first half
of the twentieth century. Freezes and droughts in the mid-twentieth century, caused many
growers to give up and sell their land, which led to farmland consolidation under a shrinking
number of growers (Knight 2009). Field crops such as cotton and grains dominated through
the 1950s, supplemented by sugarcane and citrus. However, the difficult years of the 1950s,
plus additional freezes in the early 1960s and a hurricane in 1967 once again devastated the
citrus industry. Farmers began a concerted effort to diversify their crops, converting some
groves to cropland and adding cotton and vegetables back into the mix
The arrival of the railroads during the early twentieth century helped to organize local
communities and private irrigation companies appeared with the funding required to build
the large, expensive systems to aid farming. In 1926, developer J.H. Houston convinced the
scattered residents of Tabasco to incorporate into a new community. The town of La Joya,
west of the project area, was established that same year and within a few years had a scattering
of residences and businesses (Chapa 2013). Also in 1926, the Goodwin Corporation began
construction on a new, modern canal system to supply water to the Marvin Goodwin Tract
near Mission. The primary intake canal, located north of Penitas, transported water pumped
from the Rio Grande near La Joya. In 1946 Hidalgo County Water Control and Improvement
District No. 16 received a charter to construct an irrigation system north of the project area.
Construction did not begin until 1952, however, and the soils through which the water traveled
added too much salt to the water for citrus trees to thrive. Citrus City and its surroundings thus
focused more on crop agriculture instead of citrus groves.

Population of Penitas and surrounding communities remained very low until the 1970s, when
colonias began to emerge (Garza 2013). These informal housing developments were platted
and built in unincorporated areas across south Texas without adequate electrical, water, and
wastewater infrastructure. Residents were primarily economically disadvantaged minorities.
Since the 1990s, however, various federal and state, as well as privately funded assistance
programs have been created to improve infrastructure in these distressed communities. As a
result populations have swelled considerably. In 2000, the population of Penitas was 1,167,
and in 2010 it was 4,403.

Cultural Resources In Proximity To The Project Area
Background research for this project consisted of an online records search through the Texas
Historical Commission’s Archaeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) and a review of historic period
maps. Research focused on the identification of archaeological sites, Registered Texas Historic
Landmarks (RTHLs), sites listed on the NRHP, sites listed as SALs, cemeteries, and previous
surveys. The search revealed that there are no NRHP sites, SALs, RTHLs, or cemeteries within
one kilometer (0.62 miles) of the project area. Thirteen archaeological sites fall within one
kilometer of the APE; these sites are listed in Table 1. The majority of the sites are prehistoric
in age and consist primarily of surficial lithic scatters. All but one of the sites, 41HG99, are
listed as ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP (Table 2). Lastly, a total of six cultural resource
surveys have been completed within one kilometer of the APE.

Six cultural resource surveys have been completed within one kilometer of the APE. These
include a long linear survey encompassing approximately 77 kilometers in length, a short
linear survey and three more linear surveys that were conducted in the area, but are wide
enough to be considered areal surveys in the THC atlas.

Methodology
Prior to the investigations, the APE limits were overlaid on aerial based gridded maps and
loaded onto hand-held DeLorme GPS units to aid in navigation. Examination of the APE
consisted of intensive walk-over surveys and shovel testing at regular intervals. Areas of
disturbance were thoroughly photographed and archaeologists made notes on the conditions
encountered during the investigations.
Strategically placed shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and extended to a
maximum depth of 80 cm below surface (cmbs) within undisturbed portions of the landscape,
wherever access was available. The shovel tests were excavated in 10-cm increments and all
soil was screened through a ¼-inch hardware cloth. In the event that cultural material was
recovered from a shovel test, the shovel test was delineated at 10-meter (m [3.28-ft]) intervals
until two negative shovel tests in every cardinal direction were attained, or until a project
area boundary or physical hindrance was encountered. Relevant information for all shovel
tests was recorded on a standardized form. Shovel tests were backfilled on completion. This
archaeological investigation was a non-collection survey and therefore artifacts encountered
during the course of the work were returned to their original location.
For the purposes of this survey, an archaeological site had to contain a certain number of
cultural materials or features older than 50 years within a given area. The definition of a site
is: (1) five or more surface artifacts within a 15-m (ca. 50 ft) radius; or (2) a single cultural
feature, such as a hearth or burned rock midden, observed on the surface or exposed during
shovel testing; or (3) a positive shovel test containing at least five total artifacts; or (5) two
positive shovel tests located within 30 m (98 ft) of each other. Archaeologists documented one
prehistoric archaeological site that met these criteria, and one isolated find from a shovel test.
Project specific information was recorded on standardized forms and GPS coordinates were
captured for all excavations during the course of this project.

Survey Results
Archaeologists found most of the APE has been recently altered as a result of agriculture,
new development, caliche mining, or oil extraction. The proposed Liberty Boulevard APE
is situated within a rapidly growing border community in which new roads, housing, and
commercial centers are built almost monthly. Liberty Boulevard is one example of the newly
evolving road network that will help connect residential, commercial, and industrial centers
around Penitas. The natural landscape in this area is generally flat and has no natural drainages
crossing it, although the topography generally slopes gently upward from south to north. Two
twentieth century canals cross the APE in the southern half of the proposed Liberty Boulevard
and both have elevated levees bordering either side of them.
The entire APE was inspected on foot and through visual reconnaissance. Shovel testing
concentrated on areas where right-of-entry to private properties was available and where
there appeared to be some potential for archaeological resources. Investigators excavated 76
shovel tests in support of the survey and documented one new archaeological site, 41HG248,
discussed below.

From US 83 to 265 feet North of Volcano Avenue (2nd elevated
canal).
AmaTerra’s survey progressed from north to south along the 6.1 mile stretch of proposed
road (Figure 3). The southernmost half mile runs adjacent to a WalMart Supercenter and a
new elementary school, and was already built at the time of survey, with newly planted trees
marking the edge of the ROW (Figure 4). Shovel testing in this area was therefore limited,
due to these obvious disturbances and was confined to the edge of the ROW. Not surprisingly,
shovel tests were negative.
The APE then crosses an elevated canal (1st elevated canal). Recent tree plantings at regular
intervals continue to mark the edge of the ROW for the next mile. The road itself was under
construction at the time of the archaeological survey. The area in between the ROW limits
had been bladed and prepared for construction, though it remained unpaved (Figure 5). Here
also, surface disturbance from construction preparation was obvious, though shovel testing
revealed that disturbances extended only to about 30 centimeters below the surface, and subsoils remained intact. AmaTerra conducted 13 shovel tests in this stretch of road. Virtually all
shovel tests revealed almost identical profiles composed of brown (10YR 4/3) soft silty loam
(0-ca. 50 cm) over lighter brown (10YR 5/4) compact, silty clay loam. One shovel test (M2)
contained a flake of brown banded chert in the 40-60-cm level. Three additional tests were
placed around it and all were negative. None of the other shovel tests in this segment were
positive.

Avenue

Figure 4. Southernmost portion of Liberty Boulevard.

North of the 2nd elevated canal
to Pino Street, the Liberty
Boulevard ROW runs adjacent
to a recent housing development
that forms the western ROW
boundary (Figure 6). A caliche
mining pit forms the eastern
ROW boundary and, in fact,
has disturbed the entire ROW
adjacent to it (Figure 7). As
a result no shovel tests were
excavated in this section.

North of Pino Street and all
the way to Blue Jay Avenue,
Liberty Boulevard is an existing
roadway, though expansion of
this road is proposed as part of
the current undertaking. Here the
ROW runs through another new
housing development (Figure
8), punctuated by occasional
stretches of unplatted and vacant
land. Shovel testing took place
on all accessible parcels that
seemed to have some potential
for undisturbed deposits. Access
was available to only about 60
Figure 5. Liberty Boulevard undergoing construction.
percent of the parcels in this
segment, though many of the
parcels where access was not available were residential lots that had obviously been graded or
filled, making shovel testing unwarranted. Several undeveloped parcels in the segment were
thickly overgrown former grazing tracts. Vegetation on these parcels included acacia, tasajillo,
mesquite, althorn bushes and other spiky, scrubby plants forming at times an impenetrable
tangle (Figure 9). Archaeologists excavated 17 shovel tests along this segment of roadway.
Shallow bedrock composed of loosely consolidated caliche was encountered at about 65 cmbs
in several of the shovel tests (see M4-M6 and R4, Appendix A) in this segment, though most
of the tests extended all the way to 80 cmbs. A typical soil profile consisted of brown silty
loam (10YR 5/4) over compact reddish brown silty clay loam (5YR 4/4) with caliche at various
depths.

Only one shovel test (R6) was positive. Five fragments of clear bottle glass were noted in
the upper 5-cm with no related historic period materials, objects or features observed on the
surface anywhere around this test. Given the probable recent origin of these glass fragments,
the lack of any associated materials around them, and the residential aspect of the surrounding
land, it was felt that the fragments did not merit consideration as archaeological material.
Therefore, no further tests were excavated around Shovel Test R6.

From Blue Jay Avenue to FM 2221
The northernmost of the Liberty Blvd APE is characterized almost entirely by active agricultural
fields covering about 2.7 miles (Figure 10). The survey took place in November, and at that
time fields had been recently plowed with no crops growing in them. Access was available to
about 90 percent of this segment and investigators concentrated most shovel tests in this area.
Archaeologists placed 42 shovel tests between Blue Jay Avenue and FM 2221 (Figure 11). Not
surprisingly, the upper 30-cm exhibited disturbance from plowing, though the sediments below
appeared to be intact. Typically, shovel tests in this area extended all the way to 80 cmbs and
exhibited brown silty loam (10YR 5/4) to a depth of about 70 cmbs over lighter brown silty
clay loam (10YR 7/2) with some caliche gravels below that.
One archaeological site was noted on the surface in a plowed field approximately 0.5 miles
south of FM 2221. This site was first observed by a thin scatter of material visible on the
surface of the plowed field. Subsequent shovel testing found debitage in two shovel tests,
but all was confined to the upper 30 cmbs, within the plow zone. Site 41HG248 is discussed
further below.

characterize the northern segment of the APE.

Site 41HG248
Site 41HG248 appears to be
the remains of a prehistoric
campsite that is now
completely disturbed. This
site consists of a thin lithic
and burned rock scatter
extending from the top and
down the sides of a low hill
in a plowed field (Figure
12). The low hill is the
highest point around with a
gentle slope downward in all
directions, making it wellsuited as a campsite. Within
Figure 12. View of Site 41HG248 looking

downslope toward the northeast.
for a distance of about 1100
feet (350 m) north to south
and appears to extend outside the ROW on the east and west sides. There is an un-plowed
parcel directly adjacent to the ROW (outside the ROW) to which AmaTerra investigators did
not have access. This parcel may contain more intact cultural material, but was not evaluated
because it is outside the proposed ROW (Figure 13).
Investigators observed flakes, burned rock and one biface on the surface. Some of the lithic
debris found at Site 41HG248 looked like possible tractor spalls, but it is obvious that other
material, such as the biface, was intentionally worked (Figure 14). The flakes were fashioned
from pinkish and orange-brownish chert. The burned rocks encountered range in size from
roughly 3-5 cm.
Artifact density at the site is low, with about one flake or burned rock every 6-12 feet (2-4 m).
The artifact scatter appears to be confined mostly to the surface, as all but two shovel tests
placed in the vicinity contained artifacts and these were probably buried as a result of plowing.
Agricultural disturbance in the field extends to roughly 25-30 cmbs.
The site was documented with a total of seven shovel tests. Two of these tests were positive for
subsurface cultural material; one test contained burned rock and another contained one flake in
the upper 10 cmbs. All other shovel tests were negative. All subsurface material is within the
plow zone suggesting that the site was on the surface and now completely disturbed, at least
within the ROW. The site is recommended as not eligible for listing as a SAL or in the NRHP.

Recommendations
AmaTerra surveyed approximately 6.1 miles of existing and new location roadway from
US Highway 83 in Penitas to Farm-to-Market (FM) 2221. The project was conducted under
Section 106 and the ACT and work conformed to the guidelines for implementation of these
regulations under 36 CFR 800 and 13 TAC 26. Work was limited to public land and those
private properties for which ROE was granted. Access was available to approximately 75
percent of the APE .
Archaeologists excavated 76 shovel tests in support of the project and found no archaeological
sites that would be considered eligible for listing in the NRHP. One new archaeological site
was recorded, 41HG248, consisting of burned rock and lithic debitage scattered on the surface
of a plowed field. The site, which is likely the remains of a prehistoric campsite, is completely
disturbed from plowing and as a result is recommended as not eligible for listing in the NRHP.
The survey found that overall, the project area has been heavily altered by new housing
construction, agriculture, and gravel mining. Based on these results AmaTerra recommends
no further work for any of the proposed APE, including areas where access was not available.
Archaeologists did not collect any artifacts during this survey and therefore none will be
curated at TARL. Notes and records from the project, however, will be sent to that facility.
This report is submitted in partial fulfillment of Antiquities Permit 6716.
