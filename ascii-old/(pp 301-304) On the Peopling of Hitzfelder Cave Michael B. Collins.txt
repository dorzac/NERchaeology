On the Peopling of Hitzfelder Cave
MICI-IAEL B. COLLINS

Givens (1967; 1968a:219; 1968b:47-50) has clearly-though cautiously-implied that he believes a portion of the individuals recovered
from the site of Hitzfelder Cave in Central Texas is morphologically
distinct from American Indian Homo sapiens. The "distinctions" are
almost entirely non-nletric and include (1) pronounced supraorbital
torus, (2) marked postorbital consta’iction, (3) low vault, (4) low
sloping forehead, and (5) dolichocrany (Givens, 1968b:48-49; 1968a:
219). Without adequately documenting his evidence, Givens suggests
a biologically heterogeneous population a pol~ion of which is "presapiens" or exhibits evidence of "pre-sapiens ancesh’y."
I must object to several of Givens’ assertions. I have discussed Hitzfelder cave with Robert A. Benfer who conducted an early test excavation in the site, I have visited the site, and I have had the opportunity
to see the recovered skeletal material in Givens’ laboratol7 in San
Antonio. I have examined closely and measured one of the skull
fragments (a nearly complete frontal) which he considers to exhibit
certain "pre-sapiens" characters.
It is important to establish two facts before claiming a given collection of skeletal material is somehow unique. First, it nmst be dated,
and second, it lnust be shown to differ signi~cantly from other, contemporary skeletal collections. Givens has accomplished neither of
these tasks, at least in print, yet he claims to have skeletal evidence
which supports the position "... that the Amerind population was
heterogeneous and probably involves a pre-sapiens type" (1968a:219).
Fh’st, the nature and age of the cave deposits are important. The
cave is a vertical shaft in the shape of an inverted funnel with the
small opening near the crest of a rounded lfinestone hi!!. A large
volume of earth ~lled the cave at the time of its discovery. The source
o£ this ~ll is di~cult to determine because it seems unlikely that it all
could have eroded from the limited surface area that is higher than
the cave enh’ance. This !imited area could be considered the source of
611 if a very long time were involved, but the presence of Middle and
Late Archaic dart point forms (including types Frio, Pedernales, and
Marshall-like) indicates a "maximum" time for ~ll-aecumulation of
6,000 years. The presence of Frio dart points indicates a more probable
elapsed time of 3,000 years or less (Pedernales points date from around

4,000 B.C. and Frio pofi~ts from around 1,000 B.C.: see Son’ow et al.,
1967: 141-145; Johnson et al., 1962; 8uhm and Jelks, 1962). Fmthermore, as Benfer (1967 and personal communication) observed, these
projectile points may have been introduced with the fill and actually
give an age indication that is too great; this is based on a single radioera’ben date (Tx 334) which indicates that the fill above the skeletons
began to accumulate about A.D. 950-----190 years. Givens (1968b) incorrectly reports this date as A.D. 1000---+190 years and dismisses it as
likely based on "washed-in surface carbon" and asserts (1968a) that
"C-14 dating has been finpossible".
It is my opinion (based on the close examination of approxhnately
200 skeletons from Archaic to protohistoric archeological contexts in
Texas and an equal number from Archaic and later sites in Arkansas)
that the material recovered from Hitzfelder Cave is entirely within
the range of variation exhibited by Amerindian Homo sapiens material
of the stone general region and time period. The one Hitzfelder skull
fragment which I have examined closely is near, but within, the
exh’elne of variation as regards robusticity of the supraorbital regions
and the extent of post-orbital constriction, but in no other character
is it at all unusual when compared to contemporary material of the
same region. (Descriptions of pertinent skeletal material can be found,
mnong other sources, in the following: Aten, 1965; Benfer and MeKern, 1968; Burton, 1966; Collins et al., 1966; Ellzey et al., 1966; Greer
and Benfer, 1963; Hooton, 1933; Hrdlicka, 1938; Maples, 1962; MeKern, 1962; Stewm% 1945.)
Specifically, many of the prehistoric crania from Texas and neighboring areas exhibit considerable robusticity, moderately sloping foreheads and dolichocrany. The frequent combination of dolichocrany
and sloping forehead gives a false impression of the vault being low
(Comas, 1966). These traits, alone or in combination, do not constitute evidence for a "pre-sapiens" population; furthermore, the Hitzfelder population would not be unusual in exhibiting evidence of
"pre-sapiens ancestry" as this is inherent in human evolution.
Angel (1966:13-15) and Iieed (1967:63-64) emphasize that "ancient" eharacteIJstics do not necessarily indicate great antiquity. They
suggest that human populations existing in "refuge areas" may retain
until relatively recent times those physical features usually associated
with Palace-American individuals. Skeletal evidence for the sloping
forehead and post-orbital eonsh’iction at Hitzfelder Cave is in no way
indicative of "pre-sapiens" inhabitants nor is it in ariyway incompatible with an age of 3,000 years.

HITZFELDER CAVE

Until an archeological site report and a detailed skeletal analysis
are published which convincingly support Givens’ opinions, he would
be wiser to wonder what the Amerindian populations of America had
to do with the "peopling" of Hitzfelder Cave than what an Indian
population of perhaps as late as 1000 B.C. had to do with the
"peopling of America".
