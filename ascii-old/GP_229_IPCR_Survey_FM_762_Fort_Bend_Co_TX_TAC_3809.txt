ABSTRACT
This report presents the findings of an Intensive Pedestrian and Reconnaissance
Cultural Resources Management Survey conducted on an estimated 4.3 kilometers (2.7
miles) or 8 hectares (19.76 acres) of property associated with the proposed expansion of FM
762 in Fort Bend County, Texas.
Field investigation were conducted on June 20, 2005 and consisted of pedestrian and
vehicular reconnaissance, photographic documentation, and subsurface shovel testing.
Subsurface investigation included the excavation of 17 shovel tests in previously undisturbed
and disturbed areas to depths ranging between 28 to 100 centimeters (11 to 39.37 inches). In
general, the soils encountered during fieldwork were similar to those described in Mowery et
al. (1960) and consisted of hard clays and sandy clay loams. These soils are described by
Abbott (2001) as having low potential for cultural remains and at least one segment of the
project shows signs of periodic inundation.
Prior to fieldwork mobilization, a background literature and site file search indicated
that one previously recorded archaeological site (41FB105) was located within the project
area. This site was recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and all associated
structures were reportedly already destroyed at the time of its recordation in 1985. A new
housing development currently occupies the recorded location of the site.
During this investigation, no cultural remains or features were located within the
project area. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological work is required,
and that the project be cleared to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
Berg Oliver Associates, Inc. contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston,
Texas (HRA Gray & Pape), to perform an Intensive Pedestrian Cultural Resources
Management Survey on an estimated 4.3 kilometers (2.7 miles) or 8 hectares (19.76 acres) of
property proposed for roadway expansion in Fort Bend County, Texas. This property is
associated with Farm to Market (FM) Road 764, and extends from U.S. Highway 59 (U.S.
59) to FM 2759.
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if project construction
would affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to
established whether or not previously unidentified cultural resources were located within the
project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE). Work conducted to complete this survey was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #3809, issued by the Texas Historical
Commission’s Division of Archeology in June 2005. All fieldwork and reporting activities
were completed with reference to state (the Antiquities Code of Texas) and federal (National
Historic Preservation Act [NHPA]) guidelines.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Located approximately 3.46 kilometers (2.15 miles) south of the Brazos River and
from 0.5 to 1.4 kilometers (0.3 to 0.9 miles) south of Rabbs Bayou, the project consists of the
expansion of an existing road from 2 to 4 lanes. This will entail an increase of right-of-way
(ROW) width on the north side of FM 762 of 18.29 meters (60 feet) from the existing 30
meters (100 feet) of existing ROW. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for archaeological
survey is defined as all property within the 48.77-meter (160-foot) ROW.

ACKOWLEDGEMENTS
Fieldwork was conducted by Crew Chief Tony Scott and field technicians Keith Hitt
and Arial O’Connor under the supervision of Principal Investigator James Hughey, on June
20, 2005, and required 24 person hours to complete. Site file research was completed prior
to fieldwork mobilization by Melinda Mendoza-Scott. Graphics were produced by Tony
Scott. Report text was written by Tony Scott and edited by James Hughey. The report was
produced by Melinda Mendoza-Scott.

SOILS
Specific to the project area are Bernard-Edna complex, 0 to 1 percent slopes (Be),
Bernard-Edna clay loams (Bc), Edna fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent (Ea), Edna fine sandy
loam, 1 to 4 percent (Eb), Hockley loamy fine sand (Ha), and Lake Charles clay, 0 to 1
percent slopes (La). The far eastern portion of the project consists of Lake Charles clay,
which becomes Bernard-Edna complex approximately 400 meters (1312 feet) from FM 2759
(Crabb River Road) as the project moves west. At about half the distance of the length of the
project route from FM 2759 are small areas of Bernard-Edna clay loam and Edna fine sandy
loam before a return to Bernard-Edna complex soils. The remaining western portion of FM
762 travels through Edna fine sandy loam and Hockley loamy fine sand until reaching U.S.
59.
Bernard-Edna complex, 0 to 1 percent slopes (Be) is composed of equal parts Bernard
clay loam and Edna soils, with Bernard soils occupying low, irregular and round areas of
0.04 to 0.8 hectares (0.1 to 2 acres) and Edna soils on slight mounds and ridges of 0.04 to 0.8
hectares (0.1 to 2 acres) in size (Mowery et al. 1960).
Bernard-Edna clay loams, 1 to 4 percent slopes (Bc) differs from Bernard-Edna
complex in both amount of slope and its composition, entailing 60 to 70 percent Bernard
soils and 20 to 30 percent Edna soils, and 5 percent brownish unnamed soil (Mowery et al.
1960).
In general, Bernard clay loams are composed of a surface layer of very dark gray to
dark gray clay loam 15.24 centimeters (6 inches) thick. This is followed by a layer of very
hard, very dark gray clay with a few iron-manganese concretions to a depth of 55.88
centimeters (22 inches). After this is a layer of extremely hard, very dark gray clay to a
depth of 88.9 centimeters (35 inches). Beyond that is a layer of dark gray clay with a few
yellowish brown and strong brown mottles and a few iron-manganese concretions to a depth
of 127 centimeters (50 inches). Next is a layer of grayish brown clay mottled with yellowish
brown spots and includes a few iron-manganese and calcium carbonate concretions to a
depth of 152.4 centimeters (60 inches). Below that is a layer of strong brown sandy clay
loam to a depth of 228.6 centimeters (90 inches) (Mowery et al. 1960).
In general, Edna loams typically consist of a surface layer of dark gray to grayish
brown fine sandy loam 22.86 centimeters (9 inches) thick. This is followed by a layer with
an upper portion of gray clay mottled with dark gray and grayish brown iron depletions,
yellowish brown iron concentrations, and few dark brown to black iron-manganese
concentrations to a depth of 48.26 centimeters (19 inches). The middle portion consists of
light gray clay with light olive gray iron depletions, faint olive iron and dark brown to black
iron-manganese concentrations to a depth of 96.52 centimeters (38 inches). The lower
portion of the layer entails mottled light brownish gray and light yellowish brown clay loam
with few dark brown and black iron-manganese concretions to a depth of 127 centimeters (50
inches). This is followed by a layer of light olive gray sandy clay loam including a few olive

3

iron and iron-manganese concretions to a depth of 165 centimeters (65 inches) (SSS NRCS
USDA 2005).
Specific to the project area is Edna fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (Ea), which
generally exhibits a surface layer of grayish brown fine sandy loam to a depth of 20.32
centimeters (8 inches). This layer is very hard when dry. Beyond that is a layer of grayish
brown compact sandy clay becoming lighter gray in color with depth and including brownish
yellow mottles to a depth of 91.44 centimeters (36 inches). Beyond this the soil becomes a
yellowish-red sandy clay to a depth of 127 to 177.8 centimeters (50 to 70 inches) (Mowery et
al. 1960).
Edna fine sandy loam, 1 to 4 percent slopes (Eb) is also specific to the project area.
This soil differs from 0 to 1 percent slope Edna soils (Ea) in degree of slope, thickness of
surface layer (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters [4 to 6 inches]) and tends to exhibit a stronger
yellow to yellowish brown mottling.
Hockley loamy fine sand (Ha) consists of a surface layer of very dark grayish brown
fine sandy loam 12.7 centimeters (5 inches) thick. This is followed by a layer of dark grayish
brown fine sandy loam including dark brown iron concentrations to a depth of 58.42
centimeters (23 inches). Beyond that is a layer of yellowish brown sandy clay loam mottled
with red iron and brown iron-manganese concentrations to a depth of 127 centimeters (50
inches). That is followed by a layer of mottled yellowish brown, red, and gray sandy clay
loam to a depth of 190.5 centimeters (75 inches) (SSS NRCS USDA 2005).
Lake Charles clay (La) is described as very dark gray clay from 0 to 86 centimeters (0 to 34
inches). The surface layer ranges in color from gray to black and generally is about 20.32
centimeters (8 inches) thick. Beyond that extending 86 to 178 centimeters (34 to 70 inches)
is a transitional layer of dark gray clay mottled with light yellowish brown and reddish
yellow including a few fine iron-manganese concretions. The lower part is lighter gray in
color and contains occasional concretions of calcium carbonate (Mowery et al. 1960; SSS
NRCS USDA 2005).

CULTURE HISTORY
Most sites near the coast between the Brazos River and Sabine Lake consist of
middens of clams found in estuaries or exposed in cutbanks along streams (Aten 1983;
Patterson 1985). These middens usually contain faunal material as well as cultural remains
such as lithic tools and pottery. Inland sites are less likely to consist of middens and are
more similar to generalized and thin open-air campsites near stream channels on Holocene
terraces or the remnants of Pleistocene alluvial broad upland terraces (Black 1989). Sites of
this type consist of little to no stratification due to a short occupation time, erosion, and land
clearing. Thus, subsurface features are rare (US Army Corps of Engineers 1999).
Along the Upper Texas Coast, the Paleoindian period begins around 12,000–11,500
B.P. and ends near 9,000-8,000 B.P. (Aten 1983; Story 1990; Ricklis 2004). This period is

4

poorly represented in the archaeological evidence for the region (Aten 1983) and no sites for
this period have been verified (Ricklis 2004). Sites from this stage would be either buried by
alluvium or found in upland sites. Subsistence during the Paleoindian stage included both
hunting and gathering although there was probably an emphasis on hunting. The population
during this stage was highly mobile in response to the movement of food sources, which is
reflected in the use of high quality of lithic materials for artifacts although these materials are
lacking in Southeast Texas (Ricklis 2004).
Beginning at 7,500 B.P. and spanning 2,500 years (Aten 1983), the Early Archaic
period in this region has not been well documented. The sites may have been destroyed or
deeply buried (Aten 1983; Story 1990). In situ Early Archaic remains have been found at
Addicks Reservoir as well as other localities in the area (Story 1990). The Middle Archaic
period (5,000 to 3,000 B.P.) reveals the earliest surviving shell middens (Aten 1983). These
middens contain remains of shellfish, such as oysters and estuarine clams, faunal material
from terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, and the earliest known human burials in the region
(Aten 1983). The Late Archaic lasted from 3,000 to 2,000 B.P. and shows evidence for
population increase (Aten 1983). By 2500 B.P., the climate in this area was essentially like
the modern climate. Ground stone artifacts made from materials from southwestern
Arkansas and found in context with human burials in cemeteries such as the Ernest Witte Site
indicate the possibility of trade (Hall 1981) but the shift to the use of more poor-quality local
materials suggests less mobility (Ricklis 2004). During the late Archaic, more utilitarian
biface tools are prevalent as well as are bone tools. Late Archaic assemblages are very
similar to the early part of the Late Prehistoric stage (Aten 1983).
The transition from the Late Archaic stage to the Late Prehistoric is indicated by the
introduction of ceramics into the assemblage (Aten 1983). Cultural shifts during the Late
Prehistoric include the possible adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle and major
technological changes, such as sandy paste ceramics and, late in the stage, the bow and arrow
(Story 1990). Aten (1983) describes this period as having an increase in population due to
the larger number of sites in more specialized locations. Contact with Europeans begins near
the end of this period, but visible changes in material culture are not seen until about A.D.
1750 along with a rapid decline in population (Story 1990).

HISTORIC PERIOD DEVELOPMENT
Fort Bend County was established on December 29, 1837, from parts of Austin,
Brazoria, and Harrisburg counties. The town of Richmond, which had been incorporated in
May of that same year, was voted the county seat by the citizens of the new county. The area
was originally settled in the 1820s as part of the land granted to Moses Austin by the Spanish
colonial government. Of the 297 original grants, 53 were situated in the future Fort Bend
County (Hardin 2002).
In 1821, the schooner Lively set sail from New Orleans and anchored at the mouth of
the Brazos River. Of this first contingent of Austin’s settlers a small party continued 90
miles up the Brazos to a bend in the river. Here, in November of 1822, a blockhouse was

5

built. Other settlers followed and a small community that came to be referred to as Fort Bend
grew around the blockhouse. Fort Bend was located on one of the primary fords of the
Brazos River, and as such played a role in the troop movements of the Texas Revolution.
The site was abandoned when Santa Anna’s Mexican Army crossed the river in route to the
battle of San Jacinto. When the area was resettled the new community of Richmond was
established (Leffler 2002).
Richmond became a regional trade center in the following decades, with barges and
steamboats carrying the cotton, corn, and sugar produced in the region down the Brazos to
Galveston. In 1853 the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railway proved a further boon
to business connecting Stafford Point to Harrisburg. African slaves were essential to the
plantation economy of the region and by the 1850s outnumbered the white inhabitants of the
county. Because of this economic reality Fort Bend planters strongly supported the Southern
secession and the Civil War (Hardin 2002).
Jonathan D. Waters, a planter from South Carolina, succeeded in developing what
may have been the largest cotton and sugar plantation in Fort Bend County on property
located to the south of the current project area. By 1950, Water’s operation included the
main house, a brickyard, and a sugar mill. Over 500 slaves worked the plantation and sugar
mill (Wharton 1939). The operation was willed to Thomas Pierce circa 1860, and purchased
by T. W. House in 1872. Over the next several years, the sugar operation slowly declined,
and former Houston mayor T.H. Scanlan eventually purchased the property, circa 1920
(Glander 1984).
The economy of Fort Bend in the nineteenth century focused on cotton, sugar, corn,
and livestock production. In the 1890s, a one million dollar sugar refinery was constructed at
Sugar Land. The county also contains substantial amounts oil, gas, and sulfur deposits,
which have played a major role in the economic development of the area (Hardin 2002).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal
Plain tend to be composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits reflecting short-term occupation
episodes. In general, these sites consist of temporally non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin
subsurface deposits, or suggest the presence of multiple cultural components within a mixed
stratagraphic archaeological context. Some of these sites may entail large shell middens
yielding many types of pottery, decorative items, stone tools, and human and animal bone.
Historic sites near the project area typically consist of farm- or homesteads dating to the late
nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. No archaeological surveys have been conducted
previously within or immediately adjacent to the proposed project area. However surveys
have taken place in the greater surrounding area along the Brazos River and its flood plain.
These are summarized below.
Cultural Resource Services, Inc surveyed an area entailing 526 hectares (1,300
acres) on the flood plain of the Brazos River in 1986. The area surveyed extended from

6

Highway 59 and the Brazos River to Rabbs Bayou to the south and as far west as Crabb
River Road to fence lines on the east. The project involved archival and historic/prehistoric
background research as well as a thorough pedestrian survey of the property. Eight
previously unrecorded sites (seven historic house sites and one disused cemetery) were
found. Only one prehistoric artifact was found, a projectile point lying out of context in spoil
from Rabbs Bayou (Hudson et al. 1986).
Prewitt and Associates undertook a survey of 505 hectares (1247 acres) in Fort Bend
County, Texas in 1985. The survey covered small portions of the current investigation along
the north side of FM 762. Eleven previously unidentified archaeological sites were
discovered. Four of these appeared to be the disturbed remains of late nineteenth or early
twentieth-century tenant houses or farmsteads; the remaining seven sites were the locations
of early to middle twentieth-century tenant houses or farmsteads, one of which was also
reported to have a prehistoric lithic scatter. These sites are listed as 41FB103 – 41FB113.
Of these sites, one (41FB105) falls within the current APE and is discussed below. None of
these sites were listed as eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) (Lisk et al. 1985).
In 1987-1988, Espey, Huston & Associates conducted an extensive block survey
covering property just south of Old Oyster Creek as well as several hundred acres to the east.
The survey included the excavation of several deep test trenches in an effort to locate buried
cultural deposits. The investigations resulted in the identification of 23 cultural resources
sites and two prehistoric isolated finds. Several of these resources were historic farm and
house sites. In general, these sites were composed of surface scatters containing low-fired
brick fragments and shallow subsurface deposits consisting of various glass fragments, bits
of tin and metal from roofs and unidentified metal machine fragments. None were
recommended for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as State Archeological
Landmarks. (Voellinger and Moore 1988).
In 2004, Michael Baker, Inc., undertook a survey for the proposed expansion of U.S.
59 from Spur 10 to SH 99. One site (41FB291) is recorded within the survey boundary. This
site was recorded as entailing 20th Century modern historic materials and Late Prehistoric or
Ceramic period lithic scatter. This site was not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP
(Mooney 2004).
In preparation for a temporary bridge crossing, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC surveyed a
0.08-hectare (0.2-acre) section of Oyster Creek in May 2004. Historic site 41FB292 was
discovered during the course of the survey. The site was composed of historic artifacts
located primarily within the top 20 centimeters (8 inches) below the surface. Artifacts
included low-fired brick fragments, glass, square nails and metal fragments. This site was
not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP (Hughey et al. 2004).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
This intensive pedestrian survey was designed to identify and assess preliminarily
cultural resources that may be impacted by the proposed project. Potential buried and
surface archaeological resources fall within the purview of this investigation.
Background and site file research was initiated prior to fieldwork mobilization.
Background literature search included a review of both archaeological site files and
architectural resource files, and a review of previously conducted cultural resource surveys in
the vicinity. This information was obtained by reviewing records through the on-line Texas
Sites Atlas, maintained by the Texas Historical Commission. As part of the literature search,
HRA Gray & Pape created a series of tables to document previously identified resources located
within a 1.6-kilometer (1 mile) radius of the project area. Cultural resources identified during
this literature search included previously recorded archaeological sites, and previously
conducted cultural resources surveys.
The project area is situated on 7.95 hectares (19.64 acres) of land proposed for
expansion of FM 762. Construction activities associated with this undertaking will consist of
the expansion of 4.3 kilometers (2.7 miles) of existing roadway. The archaeological survey
project area is defined as all property within the proposed alignment and includes an
approximately 18-meters (60-foot) width of new ROW.

METHODOLOGY
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were
designed to identify and record the existence of cultural resources, prehistoric and historic,
within the defined project boundaries. These field methods also facilitated the collection of
data needed in order to determine whether additional investigations would be required to
evaluate the potential eligibility of any newly defined cultural resources for inclusion on the
NRHP or as a state designated landmark.
Prior to fieldwork mobilization, the project location was plotted against data
available on relevant PALM map units. A project-specific PALM map was created by
TxDOT for this project. The current project falls within Map Units 2, 2a, and 4. Map Unit 2
requires surface survey that includes subsurface testing by shovel testing and deep testing if
deep impacts are anticipated. Map Unit 2a requires surface survey and subsurface testing
only on natural mound formations. Deep testing is not required. Map Unit 4 requires no

8

survey. Survey of this project area consisted of intensive pedestrian survey utilizing shovel
testing, photo-documentation, and pedestrian reconnaissance. In areas where surface
visibility allowed for an examination of the ground surface (i.e. surface visibility greater than
30 percent), a surface inspection of an area measuring 4 meters2 (43 feet2) was also
performed at the location of each planned shovel test.
Shovel tests were placed at 100-meter (328.1-foot) intervals in areas considered to
have a low-probability for containing cultural material. Regardless of the test interval, linear
transects were utilized for the positioning of these shovel tests within the limits of the survey
area. Shovel tests were not excavated in areas containing standing water or areas of
excessive slope (greater than 20%). In the ROW proposed for expansion of existing
roadway, shovel tests were placed along one transect situated on the north side of FM 762.
Shovel testing consisted of the placement of a series of 30 centimeter x 30-centimeter
(11 inch x 11 inch) diameter tests and was excavated to a maximum depth of 1 meter (3 feet)
into the underlying substratum, or until saturated or culturally sterile subsoil was
encountered.
Vertical control was maintained by excavating each shovel test in 10­
centimeter (4 inches) levels. One wall of each shovel test was profiled and the walls and floor
of each shovel test were inspected for color or texture change potentially associated with the
presence of cultural features. When possible, soils were screened through ¼ inch wire mesh;
soils with high clay content were hand sorted. Descriptions of soil texture and color followed
standard terminology and the Munsell (1994) soil color charts. Additional information
concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized shovel test forms for each
excavation.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
A total of 6 archaeological sites are located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of
the project area (Table 1). One of these (Site 41FB105) falls within the project APE. Site
41FB105 is a historic house/farm site located 20 to 40 meters (65.62 to 131.2 feet) north of
FM 762. Structures associated with the site had apparently been destroyed by the time the
initial site record was made in 1985 and the site was recommended as ineligible for inclusion
in the NRHP (Lisk et al. 1985). Currently the location falls within a housing development
and is assumed destroyed. Site 41FB106 consists of a scatter of historic trash to a depth of
30 centimeters (11.81 inches) and 6 to 8 chert flakes of questionable provenience found on
the surface of a dirt trail. The site was recorded as having been severely disturbed and no
further work was recommended (Lisk et al. 1985). Site 41FB114 is reported to have been a
house site possibly dating to 1881 and associated with freed slave Samuel Thompson,
although it was undetermined whether artifacts were associated with a more recent structure.
Square and wire nails, window glass, milk glass, a white china shard, brick, and a piece of
rubber were found in shovel tests to depths of 20 centimeters (7.87 inches). The site is
recorded as being heavily disturbed and no further work was recommended (Lisk et al.
1985). Site 41FB286 is a family cemetery associated with a member of Austin’s “Old Three
Hundred” colonists. A grave headstone was discovered 2 centimeters (0.8 inches) below the
surface and remains of a brick vault were also discovered. It was recommended as having

9

potential for NRHP inclusion (Crosser 2002). Site 41FB291 is reported to be comprised of a
moderate to high density of 20th Century modern historic materials and a low density of Late
Prehistoric or Ceramic period cultural materials found at a depth of 10 to 50 centimeters
(3.94 to 19.69 inches). Due to disturbance from agricultural practices and the construction of
U.S. 59 the site was determined ineligible for NRHP inclusion (Mooney 2004). Site
41FB133 entails the remains of a historic house site or associated outbuildings. Artifacts
were comprised of clear glass bottles, iron nails, brick, and earthenware shards found
between 0 to 15.24 centimeters (0 to 6 inches). The site was recommended as ineligible for
NRHP inclusion (Hudson et al. 1986).

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
Intensive pedestrian survey activities and mechanical deep testing were designed to
assess the potential impact that construction processes might have on cultural resources
located within the proposed road expansion project area. To accomplish this survey the
project area was subdivided into segments (numbered 1 through 5) (Figures 2 and 3). The
results of the segment surveys are described below.
SEGMENT 1
Segment 1 begins at the intersection of FM 2759 and FM 762 and continues west for
approximately 2330 meters (7644 feet) to Williamswood Boulevard (Figure 2).

This segment includes several developed portions including two subdivisions. This segment
is located in PALM Map Units 2a and 4 and was surveyed for cultural resources by
pedestrian and vehicular reconnaissance survey. Approximately 0.91 hectares (2.25 acres) of
this segment was covered in a previous survey done by Prewitt and Associates in 1985 (Lisk
et al. 1985). During that survey Site 41FB105 was discovered. A housing development now
occupies the area where the site was recorded (Plate 1). No natural mound formations
requiring subsurface testing under Map Unit 2a were located within the ROW through this
segment. No cultural materials were discovered in this segment.
SEGMENT 2
Segment 2 entails a flat fenced-in short grass pasture with its boundary at
Williamswood Boulevard to the east and a gravel access road located approximately 655
meters (2149 feet) to the west (Figure 3, Plate 2). This segment is located in PALM Map
Unit 2 and was surveyed by pedestrian reconnaissance and shovel testing. Shovel tests were
placed at 100-meter (328-foot) intervals along one transect running parallel to, and placed 30
meters north of FM 762. A total of 7 shovel tests were excavated for this segment.
Segment 2 is mapped as being comprised of Bernard clay loam (Bc) and Edna fine
sandy loam (Eb) in the soils guide for Fort Bend County (Mowery et al. 1960). Shovel Test
2:4 displays a typical soil profile for the segment consisting of very hard and dry dark grayish
brown (10YR 4/2) clay loam to a depth of 50 centimeters (20 inches) followed by very dark
grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay with dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) iron mottling to a
depth of 1 meter (3.28 feet) (Figure 4). All shovel tests in Segment 2 were negative for
cultural materials.
SEGMENT 3
Segment 3 begins just past the fenceline marking the boundary of Segment 2 and
continues west for approximately 830 meters (2723 feet) where it reaches FM 2977
(Cemetery Road) (Figure 3). This segment entails short grasses with interspersed clumps of
tall grass surrounded by erosion/runoff channels of bare earth (Plate 3). Scattered throughout
are a few remains of crayfish stacks. In total the landscape suggests a periodic flooding of
the area. It is located in PALM Map Unit 2, and 2a and was surveyed by pedestrian
reconnaissance and shovel testing. Shovel tests were placed at 100-meter (328-foot)
intervals along one transect running parallel to, and placed 30 meters north of FM 762. A
total of 7 shovel tests were excavated for this segment.
Segment 3 is mapped as being comprised of Bernard-Edna complex (Be) and Edna
fine sandy loam (Ea) in the soils guide for Fort Bend County (Mowery et al. 1960).
Characteristic shovel test profiles for this segment resembled those of Segment 1, but also
included profiles illustrating an increased sandy matrix. A good example of this is Shovel
Test 3:4, which was comprised of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam to a depth of 20
centimeters (8 inches) followed by a layer of dark gray (10YR 4/1) sandy clay loam with
increasing clay content with depth. The soil in ST4 became saturated at 45 centimeters
(17.72 inches) (Figure 4). All shovel tests in Segment 3 were negative for cultural materials.

SEGMENT 4
Segment 4 begins at FM 2977 and continues west for approximately 270 meters (886
feet) until reaching the entrance ramp for U.S. 59 North (Figure 3). This segment is
composed of short grass pasture that slopes down into a small periodically inundated
drainage of Rabbs Bayou and then rises to meet the entrance ramp (Plate 4). This segment
entails PALM Map Units 2 and 4 and was surveyed by pedestrian reconnaissance and shovel
testing. Shovel tests were placed on level ground on either side of the drainage along one
transect running parallel to, and placed 30 meters north of FM 762. A total of 2 shovel tests
were excavated for this segment.
Segment 4 is mapped as being comprised of Hockley fine sandy loam (Ha) in the
soils guide for Fort Bend County (Mowery et al. 1960). The characteristic shovel test profile
for this segment is that of Shovel Test 4:2, which entailed a layer of light yellowish brown
10YR 6/4 sandy silt loam to a depth of 65 centimeters (25.59 inches) followed by very
compact yellowish brown 10YR 5/6 silty sand to a depth of 70 centimeters (27.56 inches)
(Figure 4). All shovel tests in Segment 4 were negative for cultural materials.
SEGMENT 5
Segment 5 begins at the entrance ramp for U.S. 59 and ends approximately 200
meters (656 feet) to the west at U.S. 59 (Figure 3). Approximately 70 meters (230 feet) in
the eastern portion of this segment is comprised of a paved parking lot (Plate 5). The
remaining 0.1-hectare (0.24-acre) portion to the west was covered in a previous survey
undertaken by TxDOT in 2003. It is comprised of flat, cleared, and modified pasture until
sloping down at its western edge to where U.S. 59 crosses under FM762 (Plate 6). The
western most portion of the segment was covered in a previous survey undertaken by
Michael Baker, Inc., in 2004. This segment lies in PALM Map Unit 2 was covered by
pedestrian reconnaissance and shovel testing. One shovel test was excavated for this
segment.
The profile of Shovel Test 5:1 consisted of a surface layer of dark gray 10YR 4/1 silty
clay for a depth of 8 centimeters (3.15 inches) followed by brown 10YR 4/3 sandy clay
mixed with gravel, concrete, and shell fill to a depth of 30 centimeters (11.81 inches) when
the amount of concrete made further excavation impossible. No cultural materials were
discovered in this segment.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report presents the findings of an Intensive Pedestrian and Reconnaissance
Cultural Resources Management Survey conducted on an estimated 4.3 kilometers (2.7
miles) or 8 hectares (19.76 acres) of property associated with the proposed expansion of FM
762 in Fort Bend County, Texas. Prior to fieldwork mobilization, a background literature
and site file search was conducted to identify the presence of recorded sites near the project
area. The search indicated that one previously recorded archaeological site (41FB105) was
located within the project area, and 5 others are located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius
of the project area. These sites are comprised of the remains of historic houses or farms and
one family cemetery. All cultural materials associated with these sites were found on or near
the surface. Of these sites only one (Site 41FB286) was recommended as having potential
for inclusion in the NRHP. As planned, this project will not have an effect on Site 41FB286.
A new housing development appears to occupy the recorded location of historic house site
41FB105. This site was recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and all
associated structures were reportedly already destroyed at the time of its recordation in 1985.
No other archaeological sites were identified in or immediately adjacent to the current project
area.
Field investigation consisted of pedestrian and vehicular reconnaissance,
photographic documentation, and subsurface shovel testing. Subsurface investigation
included the excavation of 17 shovel tests in previously undisturbed and disturbed areas to
depths ranging between 28 to 100 centimeters (11 to 39.37 inches).
In general, the soils encountered during fieldwork were similar to those described in
Mowery et al. (1960) and consisted of hard clays and sandy clay loams. These soils are
described by Abbott (2001) as having low potential for cultural remains and at least one
segment of the project (Segment 3) shows signs of periodic inundation.
During this investigation, cultural remains or features were not located within the
project area. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological work is required,
and that the project be cleared to proceed as planned.
