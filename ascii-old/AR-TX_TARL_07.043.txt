INTRODUCTION
As part of an environmental assessment conducted
by the NUS Corporation for Cities Service Corporation,
the Texas Archeological Survey, The University of Texas
at Austin, carried out a preliminary archival and literature
search and a limited on-site reconnaissance of a 1,300
acre tract in Matagorda County, Texas. The objectives of
this survey were to identify known cultural resources which
might be affected by development of this tract. The archival
and historical research was performed by Jack M. Jackson and
the on-site inspection by David S. Dibble, Principal Investigator
and Director of the Survey.
Historic research and land ownership lists were
compiled from the archives of the Comptrollers Office ln
the Texas State Archives. The files of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory were examined, as were the records of
the Texas State Historical Commission. No previously
recorded archeological sites and no sites listed on the National
Register of Historic Places are contained within the project
area.
HISTORIC LAND OWNERSHIP
The entire lower Colorado River valley and all of
Matagorda County lie within the rather indefinite bounds
of the Austin Colony. The 1,300 acre project area is
part of a league (4428.4 acres) of land granted to the heirs
of Andrew Smalley in 1830 by the Colony. Smalley himself
is not mentioned in the Handbook of Texas (Webb 1952), but
several subsequent owners of portions of the league were
notable enough in Texas history to merit biographical entries.

-2­

Henry Williams owned 888 acres of the league
from 1847 through 1860. The 1850 census of Matagorda
County lists that he was born in North Carolina in 1803.
Williams was a member of the Austin Colony "Old 300"
who received his grant in 1824. A Henry H. Williams
of Houston, who may be the same man (Webb 1952 Vol. II:
912),was appointed the Republic of Texas Consul in Baltimore
in 1838. From the tax records, it appears probable that
Williams lived on 756 acres of his 1824 (Bowman and Williams)
grant which he still owned in the 1850's, and not on the
property he owned in the project area. In 1852, he was taxed
on 500 head of cattle and 7 horses in addition to the two
parcels of land (TSA Tax Rolls, Matagorda County 1852).
Seth Ingram, who apparently owned a 177 acre tract in
the league at least from 1851 through 1853, was a more
colorful character. He was born in Vermont in 1790 and
served in the War of 1812. In August, 1823, he was hired
as the official surveyor of the Austin Colony. In this
capacity, he laid out the town of San Felipe and surveyed
the bounds of many of the original Austin Colony grants
(Webb 1952 Vol. I: 885). After killing another man in a
quarrel in 1830, Ingram was ostensibly confined in irons
for sixteen months, although he continued to survey land
for the Colony during this time. Ingram and his brother
were resident in Matagorda County as early as 1834. The
brother died in 1837; Seth died in 1857 and is buried at
Matagorda. It is unclear from the tax records if the
Ingrams actually lived on the 177 acre tract in question.
James H. Selkirk, who owned two parcels of the League
from 1850 through 1860, came to Texas as a lieutenant of
a company of New York Volunteers for the Texas Army.

-3­

His father, William Selkirk, was one of the Austin Colony
"Old 300". Upon his death in 1830, James inherited the
bulk of his estate, including the land at the mouth of the
Colorado River which is called Selkirk's Island. It appears
from the tax records that Selkirk was holding both parcels
in the Smalley league for investment purposes; he owned
several other properties in the area.
Neither William Baxter nor Nancy Parton are mentioned
in the Handbook of Texas, but they may have operated ranches
on the property during the 1840's and 1850's. Both owned
other property during that period. As Baxter was taxed on
65 horses and 1600 head of cattle in 1860, he must have
used his tract within the league for grazlng.
LIMITS ON THE HISTORIC RESEARCH
This preliminary overview has been limited to the
county tax returns available in the State Archives in Austin.
The tax rolls for 1836 through 1846 are missing so that
ownership during the earliest period of settlement cannot
be established. Another limitation of these tax rolls is
that although parcels of the Smalley league can be identified
by ownership, their location within the league can not.
Since roughly three-quarters of the league was owned by
county residents, a general pattern of land use before 1860
can be derived. Figure 1 presents the names of the owners
identi ed and the most probable economic use of their tracts.
The project area is included within the boundaries of
the Austin Colony, thus was settled early in the history of
Texas. More detailed investigations will be needed to determine
the probable location of any structures which may have been
erected during this period. At present, no indications that
significant historic period materials are contained within the
1,300 tract have been located.

ON-SITE RECONNAISSANCE
An on-site inspection of the project area was
carried out in August, 1980 by David S. Dibble. At this
time, the surface was obscured by a dense growth of high
grass and weeds and only major land features and standing
structures were easily seen. The one structure on the
property
a shed of conventional balloon frame construction
which appears to be less than fifty years old, probably
built to house agricultural equipment used for recent rice
cultivation.
The 1,300 acre project area is located on the primary
flood plain of the Colorado River. Extensive~odifications
for purposes of flood control, river channelization, and rice
farming have drastically altered the land surface. Rice
field irrigation canals and a levee paralleling the river
are the most obvious of the constructed features. It is
highly unlikely that any archeological remains or historic
material could have survived intact on or near the surface.
However, recent alluviation in this area is such that cultural
deposits may be buried under a protective overburden. Arch­
eological sites are known to exist in similar depositional
environments (Fritz 1975). However, during the course of
this limited reconnaissance survey, no archeological or
historical sites were identified.
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Investigations of the files of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory, the central repository for site records,
and at the Texas Historical Commission show that no known
archeological sites or sites nominated to, or listed on,
the National Register of Historic Places lie within the
project area.

-6­

A preliminary study of the historic land use indicates
that the project area was settled by members of the Austin
Colony "Old 300" but further research will be required to
identify possible locations of structures from this period.
At present, no material evidence of historic structures of
any significance has been located.
The limited on-site reconnaissance also produced no
indications of archeological or historical remains on the
1,300 acre tract. However, recent land use has drastically
altered the terrain and it is unlikely that surface or
near-surface cultural material would have survived intact.
The possibility of subsurface deposits does remain" because
of the depositional environment of the Colorado River
flood plain.
A more intensive on-site survey, augmented by limited
subsurface testing such as shovel probing, is recommended
prior to the finalization of engineering plans in order
that measures can be taken to preserve any located cultural
resources.
