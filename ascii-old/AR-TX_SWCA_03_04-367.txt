ABSTRACT
On behalf of Eagle Pass Water Works System (EPWWS) and Tetra Tech, Inc., SWCA Environmental
Consultants conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the Rosita Valley Wastewater Treatment Plant and associated facilities south of Eagle Pass in Maverick County, Texas. EPWWS, using
state and federal funds from programs administered by the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB),
will construct a wastewater treatment plant and associated facilities located 2.5 km west of Highway
1021 (El Indio Highway) and 1.5 km east of the Rio Grande. The project area covers approximately
220 acres of predominantly open, terraced agricultural fields and uplands in the lower Rosita Creek
valley. The cultural resource investigations, conducted in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act and the Texas Antiquities Code under Texas Antiquities Permit 3545, were designed to
systematically identify, record, delineate, and, to the extent possible, assess the significance of archaeological materials that would be affected by the proposed undertaking.
The investigations included a background records review, coordination with EPWWS and Tetra Tech,
Inc., and intensive field survey. The background review revealed portions of the project area had
previously been surveyed, and one recorded site, 41MV247, is located within the project area along the
effluent line. The fieldwork, conducted September 19 through 26, 2004 and October 14 through 15,
2004, included a pedestrian survey of the entire project area, excavation of 77 backhoe trenches, four
shovel tests, screening of column samples from select trenches, mapping, and site documentation. The
investigations identified a total of four sites, including three newly recorded prehistoric sites (41MV301303) and the previously recorded prehistoric site 41MV247. Site 41MV303 is a fairly extensive multicomponent occupational site on the southern terraces of Rosita Creek. The site includes primarily
surficial deposits, but also occasional small burned rock features buried in the upper meter of the soil
profile. The surface deposits lack integrity, but the subsurface deposits have potential for intact features or surfaces. Though the significance of the deposits could not be clearly determined, based on the
potential for buried intact deposits, avoidance of the site is recommended. Sites 41MV301 and 41 MV302,
located upstream in the Rosita Creek valley, are heavily eroded open camps consisting of relatively
diffuse burned rock, debitage, and lithic tools. Lacking integrity or a substantial material assemblage,
neither site is considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as
a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). Within site 41MV247, the proposed pipeline right-of-way is
heavily disturbed, and backhoe trenching revealed no intact deposits. Seven backhoe trenches with
hand-excavated column samples placed through the site uncovered a very sparse scatter of burned rock
and lithics but no intact deposits. Accordingly, archaeological clearance is recommended within the
right-of-way through the site, with the caveat that construction impacts be carefully limited to the
easement.
Contingent upon avoidance of potentially significant parts of site 41 MV303 and limiting construction
impacts to existing disturbances along the pipeline right-of-way through site 41MV247, SWCA concludes that the project will have no adverse affects on significant cultural resources. EPWWS and Tetra
Tech have indicated that the potentially significant parts of site 41MV303 will be avoided by construction, operation, and maintenance of the wastewater facilities. In accordance with these stipulations, it
is recommended that the Rosita Valley Wastewater Treatment Plant be allowed to proceed with no
further archaeological work.

Cultural Resource Survey of the Rosita Valley Wastewater Treatment Plant and Related
Facilities, Maverick County, Texas.
PROJECT TITLE:

SWCA PROJECT NUMBER:

8681-126.

Eagle Pass Water Works System (EPWWS), using state and federal funds
administered through the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), would construct a wastewater
treatment plant, irrigation disposal area, effluent line, and two interceptor lines in the Rosita Creek
valley south of Eagle Pass. SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the project
area. The study included a background records review and pedestrian survey with backhoe trenching.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The project area includes four areas of potential effect: 1) a 2-acre Rosita Valley plant site,
2) the 1.95-km effluent pipeline, 3) the 3.25-km Rosita Creek interceptor pipeline, and 4) a 220-acre
sludge irrigation disposal area. The 220 acres of the plant site and surrounding disposal area are
situated on Holocene, alluvial terraces of Rosita Creek, a tributary to the Rio Grande, located 2.5 km
west of Highway 1021 (El Indio Highway) and 1.5 km east of the Rio Grande. The pipelines cross
upland slopes and heavily disturbed areas along existing roads, primarily Rosita Valley Drive. The area
appears on the Eagle Pass SW and Eagle Pass East USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle maps.

I NTRODUCTION

On behalf of Eagle Pass Water Works System
(EPWWS), SWCA Environmental Consultants
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey
of the proposed Rosita Valley Wastewater
Treatment Plant (WWTP) and related facilities
south of Eagle Pass, Maverick County, Texas
(Figure 1.1). EPWWS, using state and federal
funds from programs administered by the Texas
Water Development Board (TWDB), would
construct a major wastewater pipeline as part of a
regional water and sewer improvement project.
In compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) and the Antiquities Code
of Texas, the cultural resource survey was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit 3545.
The investigations, designed to determine whether
the undertaking would affect significant cultural
resources, included a background archaeology
review, coordination with EPWWS and Tetra
Tech, and survey to systematically identify, record,
delineate and, to the extent possible, assess the
significance of archaeological materials.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The proposed Rosita Valley Wastewater Treatment
facilities project includes four areas of potential
effect: 1) a 2-acre Rosita Valley plant site, 2) the
1.95-km effluent pipeline, 3) the 3.25-km Rosita
Creek interceptor pipeline, and 4) a 220-acre
sludge irrigation disposal area. Additionally, the
project area includes the 4.3-km Rosita Valley
Drive interceptor pipeline, a component of the
project area that has previously been assessed and
cleared by the TWDB, and consequently was not
part of the current assessment.

Impacts associated with the 2-acre plant site are
expected to be substantial, including ground
disturbances to several meters below ground
surface. Effects within the sludge irrigation
disposal area would include relatively minor,
surficial modifications associated with cultivation
of long-established agricultural fields, though
deeper impacts to buried archaeological sites
would include the permeation of organics through
the soil profile. The 5.2 km of pipeline would
entail the construction of an 18-inch diameter pipe
installed through open-cut trenching to variable
depths within a 50-foot wide easement. The
system of interceptor and effluent lines is based
on gravity flow. Accordingly, most of the lines
will follow natural landscape contours and will
not be deeply buried.

PROJECT SETTING

The project area is situated on alluvial terraces,
colluvial toeslopes, and shallow-soiled uplands
west of Rosita Creek, a moderately prominent
intermittent tributary to the Rio Grande.
The
treatment plant and sludge disposal area cover
approximately 220 acres of fallow agricultural
land now used for grazing pasture (Figure 1.2).
The area, located approximately 2.5 km west of
Highway 1021 (El Indio Highway) and 1.5 km
east of the Rio Grande, includes primarily open
fields that have been root plowed, terraced, and
farmed for at least half of a century according to
landowner. Currently, the area is almost
exclusively mixed grass prairie (fallow
agricultural fields), bordered by mesquite

Throughout most of the project area,
modem landscape modifications are
ubiquitous, though the degree of
disturbance varies from surficial to
substantial deep impacts. The
modifications are related to
agricultural and residential land use,
which has been moderately
intensive over the last half century.
The plant and sludge disposal site

1950s, according to the landowner,

is paralleled by an irrigation canal
for most of the right-of-way.

beginning approximately 3 00 m
north of El Indio Highway, runs

western Rosita Creek valley margin.
The line ties into the eastern side of
the WWTP site.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL SETTING

The project area is situated in the Chihuahuan
Desert setting of southwest Texas, and the cultural
history in the region reflects adaptation to the arid
environment. The following sections describe the
basic environmental and cultural context of the
EPWWS Rosita Valley wastewater management
system project area.

of the sludge disposal area, includes sandstones
and other sedimentary rocks. According to studies
done on sites in the area, sandstone was the most
prevalent rock type used for hearth construction
during the Late Archaic in the area (see Vierra
1998:205-209).
SOILS

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

GEOLOGY

The proposed Rosita Valley Wastewater Treatment
Facilities is situated in the northern edge of the
South Texas or Rio Grande Plain, a subdivision
of the extensive Gulf Coastal Plain geographic
region (Arbingast et al. 1973 :6). Surface geology
of the area includes Holocene alluvium and terrace
deposits along the Rio Grande and Rosita Creek,
with Tertiary to Quaternary Uvalde Gravels and
the Cretaceous Escondido formation in upland
areas (Barnes 1976).
The Uvalde Gravel formation, exposed along
upland portions of the project area, are relict
deposits left from erosion of the High Plains
(Banks 1990:56-57). As evident by lithic debris
in the area, the formation provided a significant
lithic resource during prehistoric times. The
deposits comprise stream-rolled cherts and other
siliceous materials suitable for stone tool
manufacture.
The Escondido Formation, which outcrops along
an upland projection on the northeastern comer

Six general soils are mapped in the project area,
including Mavco loam, Elindio silty clay loam,
Lagloria very fine sandy loam, Maverick
association, Jimenez association, and Pryor clay
loams (Stevens and Arriaga 1977). Covering
much of the upland portions of the project area,
the Jimenez association soils are shallow, very
gravelly loams and loams that often comprise
eroded gravel beds. The Maverick association soils
consist of deep and moderately deep clays on
gently sloping or undulating landforms. The Pryor
group comprises sandy clay loams and clay loams
on level to gently sloping upland landforms.
Situated on the Rio Grande terraces at the western
end of the effluent line, Lagloria soils are deep
very fine sandy loams and silty clay loams. The
Rio Grande terraces are often underlain by gravel
deposits.
Concerning the soils within the project area,
agriculture in the area has historically relied
heavily on artificial irrigation systems and soil
conservation practices such as terracing to avoid
water and soil loss, as well as salt accumulation.
These activities, in addition to deep root plowing,
have substantially modified the typical profiles of

6

Chapter 2

many of the soils in the project area, notably in
the plant site and sludge disposal area.
VEGETATION

The project area lies within Gould's (197 5)
South Texas Plains vegetation region and on the
northern edge of Blair's (1950) Tamaulipan
Biotic Province. The regional vegetation is
brush land dominated by mesquite, acacia,
creosote bush, guayacan, condalia, oaks, retama,
guajillo, bee brush, cedar elm, soapberry,
persimmon, granjeno, and various cacti and
succulents. The project area, however, also
crosses extensive agricultural fields and
orchards. Along the Rio Grande, pecan orchards
cover several miles of right-of-way. Prior to
clearing fields for agriculture, mesquite likely
covered much of the terrace settings.
WILDLIFE

As noted, the project area is located within the
Tamaulipan biotic province as defined by Blair
(1950). Many species of mammals , birds '
reptiles, and amphibians occupy, or historically
occupied, this biotic province; their distribution
and densities vary considerably and are mainly
dependent upon the local vegetational
community and available water resources.
According to Davis and Schmidly (1994 ),
common small mammals that may occur in the
area include the pocket mouse, white-footed
mouse , southern plains woodrat , desert
cottontail, and black-tailed jackrabbit. Large
mammal species that occur or have the potential
to occur within the project area include whitetailed deer, feral hogs, coyote, bobcat, and
javelina.
Bird species present in the area are typical of
the brush and scrub vegetational community.
Common resident species include the mourning

dove, northern mockingbird, house sparrow,
olive sparrow, the northern bobwhite, red-tailed
hawk , and long-billed thrasher. Besides
mammals and birds, various snakes and lizards
'
and occasional toads can also be found.
Concurrent with the SWCA's archaeological
survey, Blanton and Associates biologists have
conducted a biological survey of the EPWWS
project areas; a report of their findings can be
found separately.

CULTURAL SETTING

Maverick County is located on the northern edge
of the South Texas archaeological region, but
the material record reflects common cultural
influences from adjacent regions of Texas and
Mexico. The following discussion of cultural
setting addresses the general cultural chronology
from prehistory through historical times in the
area, followed by a history of archaeological
investigations in the area. More specific findings
of the background research, aspects that are
directly relevant to the project area, are discussed
in greater detail in Chapter 4 of this report.
CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY

Maverick County lies within a cultural area
known as the South Texas Plains, which is
divided into five biogeographical subareas
(Black 1989). The project area is within the Rio
Grande Plain subarea, which is a little studied
archaeological region of Texas when compared
to most. Large-scale projects such as Choke
Canyon Reservoir, the proposed Cuero I
Reservoir, Dos Republicas Coal Mine, and the
Guerrero Gateway projects have contributed to
the general cultural sequence of South Texas
and, more specifically, the Rio Grande Plain
subarea (Hester 1995). Many other projects
have contributed to the understanding of the Rio
Grande Plain cultural sequence, although much

of the prehistory of the subarea is still ill-defined
due to the lack of more extensive archaeological
investigations in the area. The prehistory of the
subarea has been divided into three to five
periods by different authors (Black 1989; Hester
1980, 1995; Suhm et al. 1954). This study relies
on these for the basic chronology, citing

P ALEOINDIAN PERIOD

(9200 B.C. TO 6000 B.C.)

Throughout prehistory, aboriginal peoples in
South Texas basically remained nomadic huntergatherers. In the Paleoindian period, population
density and band sizes throughout South Texas
and the Rio Grande Plain are surmised to have
been relatively low. The period is characterized
by mobile, small bands with a subsistence
economy primarily based on hunting now extinct
megafauna such as mammoth and bison. The
lithic technology of the Paleoindians included
Clovis and Folsom fluted projectile points and
specialized blade core production (Hester 1995).
At the later end of this period, projectile point
styles change to non-fluted, lanceolate types
such as Angostura and Golondrina (Black
1989:49). In addition, the poorly dated Lerma
dart point commonly found in the region has
been tentatively assigned to this period (Hester
1995). Lacking substantial data, few specific
conclusions can be drawn concerning
occupation during this period in the Rio Grande
Plain. Paleoindian materials found in the Eagle
Pass area generally consist of isolated projectile
point finds. The important transitional stage
between the Paleoindian period and the
subsequent Early Archaic period is poorly
understood in this region. However, it is
believed there was a transition from big-game
hunting to generalized hunting and gathering
strategies at the later part of the Paleoindian
period (Black 1989). An accompanying
technological shift from lanceolate points to

7

stemmed dart points appears to have also
occurred.
EARLY ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA

6000 B.C. TO 2500

B.C.)

Early Archaic populations appear to have shifted
subsistence practices towards an increased
reliance on plant food resources and small game
(Black 1989:49). Early Archaic artifacts found
in the Eagle Pass area are typical of the triangular
and stemmed projectile points found elsewhere
in South Texas and adjacent areas of northern
Mexico. For the Early Archaic period, Hester
(1995) distinguishes between the "Early Comer
Notched Horizon" consisting of MartindaleUvalde-Baker point types and the later "Early
Basal Notched Horizon" consisting of Artdice
and Bell point types. Cultural materials from
this period indicate an increased use of stonelined hearths and the probable exploitation of
terrestrial and aquatic food resources. Sites
generally are found on high terraces or upland
areas. However, as with the Paleoindian period,
Early Archaic sites and materials are generally
uncommon in the Rio Grande Plain, and this
period of human occupation is presently poorly
understood (Black 1989).
MIDDLE ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA

2500 B.C. TO 400

B.C.)

The Middle Archaic period in the Rio Grande
Plain is rather generally defined in terms of both
temporal and cultural adaptation parameters,
relying to an extent on comparisons with the
Lower Pecos region and other areas of South
Texas (Black 1989:49). Black (1989:49) notes
that Middle Archaic sites are much more
commonly found in South Texas than are those
of earlier periods and that sites seem to occur in
a much broader range of topographic settings.
The Middle Archaic is generally characterized
by population increases, an expansion of lithic

8

Chapter 2

technologies, and more intensive utilization of
plant food resources. Larger, compacted hearths
and ground stone tools are believed to indicate
increased utilization of plant foods (Black 1989).
Dart points, unifacial scrapers, and preforms
found at Middle Archaic sites suggest hunting
and manufacturing activities. Gouges are
present in artifact assemblages in increased
numbers over the preceding period, possibly
suggesting increased wood- or hide-working
activities (Hester 1995). The appearance of
projectile point types typical of other regions
and marine shell not normally found in the area
suggest an expansion of trade/exchange
networks in the Rio Grande Plain. In the greater
south Texas region, burial of the dead in
cemeteries appears to be more common in this
period as evidenced by the Loma Sandia Site in
Live Oak County (Taylor and Highley 1995) and
two cemeteries in the Falcon Reservoir area (see
Hester 1995:431), but this trend has not been
clearly defined in the Laredo-Eagle Pass area.
In the Eagle Pass area, dart points from this
period include Tortugas, Bulverde, and Langtry
(see Black 1989:49), although most styles
temporally extend into other periods.
LATE ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA

400 B.C. TO A.D.

Nueces scrapers and other distally beveled tools.
Other types from this period commonly found
in the region include Desmuke, Shumla, and
Olmos bifaces (Hester 1995). Tortugas points
may also extend from the late Middle Archaic
into Late Archaic times.
LATE PREIDSTORIC PERIOD (A.D.

800 TO A.D.

1600)

The Late Prehistoric is characterized by two
technological innovations, ceramics and the bow
and arrow (Black 1989). Prehistoric sites from
this period are often the best preserved, most
distinctive, and most visible of all periods in
South Texas. Ceramics dating to this period are
generally bone and/or sand tempered. Late
Prehistoric settlement patterns suggest increased
mobility, perhaps an effect of greater reliance
on bison as a subsistence mainstay. Faunal
assemblages dated to the Late Prehistoric show
an increased consumption of bison, deer, and
antelope (Black 1989). Adoption and use of the
bow and arrow may have facilitated the shift in
balance between animal and plant foods. In
South Texas, common arrow point types include
Perdiz, Scallorn, Fresno, Starr, and Zavala
(Hester 1995).

800)

The Late Archaic period represents a
continuation of trends begun in the Middle
Archaic, mainly increasing population and
exploitation of the environment. Late Archaic
sites are common throughout South Texas in all
topographic settings. Increased population
densities for this period have been inferred by
the presence oflarge cemeteries along the coast
and eastern portions of South Texas (Black
1989). As with the preceding period,
populations in the Late Archaic exploited plant
food resources, small game, and aquatic
resources. Unstemmed dart points of the
Matamoros and Catan types typically occur on
the Rio Grande Plain and project area as well as

HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D.

1600 TO PRESENT):

ETHNOIDSTORICAL INDIGENOUS GROUPS

Chroniclers of the early Spanish expeditions
through the area and the missionaries provide
ethnohistorical descriptions of the native groups
in South Texas at the time of contact. Their
accounts defined the groups in northeast Mexico
as "Coahuilefios". From the recorded fragments
of the language of these groups, Mexican
linguists defined the Coahuilteco language in the
1860s, and later researchers constructed the
larger Coahuiltecan linguistic family, which was
surmised to include the language of groups
throughout the northeastern Mexico-South
Texas region. Although some (i.e., Ruecking

proposed a broad Coahuiltecan culture as well
as a linguistic grouping, "this belief in a
widespread linguistic and cultural uniformity
was [later] seriously questioned" (Campbell
1983 :39). Recent research has perhaps
substantiated this notion. For example Johnson
and Campbell (1991) defined the previously
unidentified Sanan language among mission
Indians in the region. In part there was perhaps
a rush to judgement in defining a "monolithic
adaptation" that led to an oversight in variability.
Nevertheless, the ethohistorical record suggests
some commonalities among the groups in the
region. All were nomadic hunter/gatherers who
moved around the landscape exploiting seasonal
foods (Campbell and Campbell 1981 ), most
likely within clearly defined territories. Griffen
(1969: 115) cites a number of early descriptions
of highly mobile groups moving within clearly
recognized and "marked" areas. Alonso de
Leon, who was observing groups south of the
Rio Grande in 1689, describes the social
organization and settlement patterns that were
commonly noted elsewhere in the region. He
describes two distinct groupings using terms
familiar to his own society: the "rancheria" and
"rancho". The former group is a larger group,
presumably the band. Based on ethnographic
accounts of groups in northeastern Mexico
Griffen (1969:115) infers an average band siz~
of 40-60 persons with recorded variations
ranging from roughly 25-7 5 individuals. These
rancherias comprised about 15 bell-shaped huts
arranged in rows or a crescent formation. Each
house contained a central fire said to be used
mainly for illumination (Campbell 1983 :51 ). As
descri~ed by de Leon, the smaller group,
occupymg the rancho, is a family unit. When
not in the larger groupings "each family ... or
two together travel around the hills, living two
da~s here and four there" (De Leon as cited by
Griffen 1969: 115). In addition to these
groupings, sources often refer to a larger group

9

as a "nation". This group is the largest identity,
but it is unclear if this level of tribal organization
was ever a viable political entity until later
ethnohistorical times when regional groups
united to confront colonial advancement. From
~he early seventeenth to early nineteenth century,
mcreased pressures from southward territorial
expansion by the Apache and Comanches and
northward Spanish expansion destroyed these
indigenous groups.
HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D.

1600 TO PRESENT):

EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT

EARLY HISTORY: SPANISH EXPLORATION

The early phase of the Historic period included
Spanish exploration and expansion into South
Texas, colonization of areas along the Rio
Grande, and the attempted rnissionization of the
local Native American groups. The earliest
Spanish chroniclers noted that the groups,
collectively identified as Coahuiltecans, were
nomadic hunter/gatherers who moved around
the landscape exploiting seasonal foods.
In this context of Native American cultures
'
Cabeza de Vaca and other survivors of the
disastrous 1527-28 Narvaez expedition were
likely the first Europeans to pass through
southern Texas in 1534. Though the precise
course of his trek has not been conclusively
determined, it is unlikely his journeys went
through the vicinity of Eagle Pass (Campbell
and Campbell 1981; see Hester 1999 for maps
of several principal interpretations of the route).
In the following 150 years, colonial exploration
generally bypassed southern Texas, though
several exploratory and punitive expeditions
were conducted in the 1600s. To punish native
groups that had been raiding frontier settlements
such as Saltillo and Monterey, in 1660 de la
Garza and a force of 100 men engaged the

10

Chapter 2

Cacaxtle Indians in a day-long battle near
modem Eagle Pass (Chipman 1992:67). The
specific location of this battle, even on which
side of the river it took place, is unclear from
the accounts. Subsequently in 1665, Fernando
de Azcue, crossing near Eagle Pass, led a second
punishing strike on the Cacaxtles in a battle
located 24 leagues north of the Rio Grande.
These expeditions reportedly killed or captured
nearly 400 Cacaxtles (Chipman 1992:67).
In 1674, Father Francisco Penasco de Lozano
and Brother Manuel de la Cruz, Franciscan
missionaries, ventured into Maverick, Val Verde,
and Kinney counties (Chipman 1992:68). The
following year, 1675, Fernando de Bosque led
an expedition into the same area with ten soldiers
and two missionaries, including Father Juan
Larios. Approximately 11 miles southeast of
present-day Eagle Pass, the expedition
encountered indigenous groups identified as the
"Yorica and Jeapa" returning from buffalo
hunting.
In the later part of the 1600s, confrontations
among global colonial powers France, Spain,
and possibly even the Dutch (Sanchez 1992:62)
spurred initial exploration and colonization of
the region and began an age of "defensive
expansion" by the Spanish (Chipman 1992:52).
La Salle established a foothold for the French
in southeastern Texas with the establishment of
Fort St. Louis. From this base, La Salle evidently
ventured as far as the Rio Grande in 1685-86 to
assess the northern frontier of Spain's territory
(Stephens and Holmes 1989:11). The Spanish
response to the French incursions initiated an
era of settlement.
To verify reports of the destruction of the French
settlement, Spain sent Alonso de Leon on a
military expedition in 1689 and a subsequent
missionizing trip in 1690. On both expeditions,
De Leon crossed the Rio Grande at the Paso de
Francia (which was named during De Leon's

earlier 1687 crossing to capture La Salle's errant
colonist Gery who was reportedly organizing
native groups in the area), which is located
approximately 25 miles south of modem Eagle
Pass near the modern town of Guerrero
(McGraw 1991:9 ; McGraw and Sparks
1991:53-55).
His route consequently
established the " gateway" for subsequent
settlement of Texas, which he so named after
the Hasinai groups of eastern Texas. He also
named many of the rivers, including the
Guadalupe, Nueces, Colorado, Brazos, Trinity,
Medina, Hondo, and others (Greene 1998:17).
After the boundary between the French and
Spanish territories was resolved in 1763, Spain
devoted its resources to colonization and
exploration of the Texas frontier. Rubi's 1767
inspection tour crossed north of present-day
Eagle Pass and returned by way of a ford farther
to the south, crossing the Rio Grande at the Paso
de Jacinto. Rubi's explorations, often chronicled
by Nicolas de LaFora, provided some of the first
data on the geography and cultural landscape of
southwest Texas. The route crossing at the Paso
de Jacinto, followed by Solis the subsequent
year, effectively established the Camino Real
through South Texas, which later became the
Old San Antonio Road.
THE MISSION ERA

De Leon's route through South Texas, crossing
at the Paso de Francia, was often followed by
subsequent Spanish expeditions from the 1690s
through the early 1700s. These expeditions
established missions and presidios in the San
Antonio area, and along the Coastal Bend on
the San Antonio and Guadalupe Rivers . In
January 1700, the Franciscans established the
San Juan Bautista Mission at the site of the
modem town of Guerrero, located 30 miles south
of Eagle Pass. The mission, the northernmost
outpost on New Spain's northeastern frontier,

grew into a complex of several missions, a
presidia, and civilian settlement. San Juan
Bautista served as a point of departure for
expeditions exploring Texas and "i~ ~ver~
respect ... was the mother of the Texas miss10ns
(Weddle 2003) . Though no missions were
located in the immediate vicinity of modem
Eagle Pass, these first settlements effectively
established social, economic, political, and legal
institutions that persist into present-day times.
In the late 1700s, San Juan Bautista and
associated mission San Bernardo gradually
faded in importance. In 1810, with the beginning
of the Mexican War of Independence, the
missions were incapacitated and lost their
religious function, a decline reflected in
changing names. San Juan was renamed Puesto
de Rio Grande and, subsequently in 1827, was
finally named Villa de Guerrero in honor of
patriot Vicente Guerrero. In 1829 the missions
were finally secularized and their lands
distributed.
Until the mid 1800s, Guerrero continued to
occupy the main route into Texas and was the
central commercial, political, and social hub of
the area. After the Mexican War of 1846-1848,
Guerrero was increasingly bypassed as
settlement and traffic shifted to Laredo to the
south and Eagle Pass to the north (Weddle 2003).
FIRST EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT IN THE PROJECT

until his death in 1779 (Downing 1971). Title
to his immense estate was often contended
through the subsequent changes in governance
from Spain to Mexico to the Republic of Texas
to the United States, but was eventually upheld
by the State of Texas in 1872 (Downing 1971 ).
EAGLE PASS

During the Mexican War, Texas Mounted
Volunteers under the command of Captain John
Veatch established an observation post along an
old river crossing known as El Paso del Aguila,
so named for the Mexican eagles that occupied
the area. The crossing was located where the
Rio Escondido emptied into the Rio Grande.
This temporary post was abandoned after the
war, but the crossing became increasingly
utilized, particularly by those drawn west by the
Gold Rush. The crossing became a staging area
known as Camp California for those traveling
to the west coast via Mazatlan. To protect the
crossing, Fort Duncan was established 2 miles
upstream in 1849, and a town, Eagle Pass,
developed along its northern side, separated by
an arroyo. In 1850, James Campbell opened a
trading post, Campbell's Store, at the crossing.
This store was recorded as site 41MV1 by
archaeologists in the 1960s. Despite the
numerous occupations of the area near the
crossing, none but the store and associated
buildings were reported to have permanent or
otherwise substantial architecture.

AREA
In the 1750s, Don Jose Dias de Oropeza, one of

the first recorded settlers in the area, established
a ranch along the Camino Real in southern
Maverick County (Downing 1971). His efforts
were fairly short-lived; Native American raiding
forced him south towards the protection of more
substantial settlements. After abandonment of
the land, Don Antonio Rivas filed for and was
granted 25 sitios (a total of approximately
110,710 acres) in 1765, land that he occupied

FORT DUNCAN

Fort Duncan, established in 1849 as a federal
frontier military post, is located northeast of
southern end of the project area. The site was
designated a Texas Historic Landmark in 196869 and listed on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) in 1971 as site 41MV2. Fort
Duncan was the fifth in a series of southwestern
Texas military posts established in 1849 to

12

Chapter 2

reinforce the new national border, which had
recently been resolved by the 1848 Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo with Mexico. The post
protected vital commercial routes utilized for
trade with the interior states of Mexico and for
migrants heading west in the goldrush years
(Figure 2.1 ). In March 1849, several companies
of the First U.S. Infantry set up tents on the east
bank of the Rio Grande a mile or two upstream
from Paso del Aguila, which was either a canyon
through hills on the Mexican side of the river or
a nearby ford across the river (see Kinsall 1999
for differing historical accounts of the name).
The camp was originally informally known as
the "Camp near Eagle Pass" until renamed in
honor of Mexican War hero Colonel James
Duncan. A prominent downcut drainage,
commonly referred to in early maps and
literature as "the arroyo", defined the northern
limits of the fort and marked the boundary
between it and the town of Eagle Pass in
historical times.
The first permanent structures were built in
1850, though these appear to have been rather
unsubstantial adobe structures. In 1853, an
inspector of the fort reported the quarters were
"wretched hovels not fit for occupancy"
(Freman's report as cited on the National
Register Nomination Form). By 1856, however,
Fort Duncan consisted of more permanent stone
and wood structures. Many of the extant
structures comprising the NRHP district were
originally built during this time.
The post was abandoned in 1859, though only
for a short period. To confront the Juan Cortinas
border wars, Robert E. Lee ordered the reoccupation of Fort Duncan in 1860. After 1860,
Fort Duncan was almost continuously occupied
until its final abandonment in 1922. During the
Civil War years (1861-1865), Confederate
forces used the post as an important supply route
for munitions from Mexico. As crossings and
ports in southern Texas came under control of

Union forces, Eagle Pass rose to prominence as
one of the more viable commercial routes for
Confederate trade with Mexico. With the
resumption of Federal control in 1868, the
central focus of the garrison shifted the
destruction of the Native American threat along
the borderlands. John Bullis organized the
Seminole-Negro Indian Scouts at Fort Duncan
in 1870; the group earned national recognition
for their relentless pursuit of marauders. After
the final Native American groups were crushed
in the late 1870s, Fort Duncan once again
became obsolete and was closed in 1883. From
1890-1917, a small force was maintained as a
precautionary presence against disturbances
from Mexico. National suspicions towards
Mexico kept the fort active during World War I.
JANE AND WILLIAM CAZNEAU

Jane McManus Storm and William Cazneau
were among the first settlers of Eagle Pass,
where they lived from 1850-1852. For a short
period they evidently lived near 41MV1, later
moving to the south near the current Indio
Ranch. Jane Cazneau, who often adopted the
pen name Cora Montgomery, was a significant
figure in Eagle Pass history, as well as national
history. A writer, diplomat, and advocate for
American expansion, Jane Cazneau and her
husband William Cazneau were instrumental in
establishing the town of Eagle Pass. During this
time Jane wrote and sketched some of the earliest
depictions of the border town (Figure 2.2). She
had been a prominent political figure in national
and Texas politics for some time. Among her
most notable contributions, she coined the
phrase "manifest destiny", though the words
have traditionally been attributed to her editor
John O'Sullivan, to describe the prevailing
sentiment ofAmerican policy of the early to mid
1800s (Hudson 2001 ). Her arrival in Eagle Pass
was part of an intent to further expand the
influence and territory of the United States (in

the 1840s she had written columns in eastern
newspapers to swing public opinion in favor of
annexation of Texas).
According to her accounts in Eagle Pass, or Life
on the Border, the Cazneaus' built a house on
the high ground north of Fort Duncan, but they
apparently initially lived near the ford across
from the Rio Escondido near where they helped
Campbell establish his store (41MV1). Though
the details are vague concerning the "old Eagle
Pass" settlement, references indicate the
structures were unsubstantial; she described her
early residence in Eagle Pass as a dugout.
Cazneau's experiences and accounts provide
some of the only firsthand accounts of early life
on the border in the vicinity of the project area.
LATE 1800s

Until the Civil War, Eagle Pass remained a
remote outpost on a hostile frontier. The town

rose to prominence, as previously mentioned,
when the town became one of the only ports for
the Confederate cotton trade (Pingenot 1971 :5).
After the war, the town continued to be a trade
route. Ranching was gradually established,
particularly as the threat of cattle rustling
gradually lessened when the Native Americans
were subdued. In 1882 the railroad arrived, as
is depicted in Koch's 1887 aerial drawing
(Figure 2.3).
In the 1880s, large-scale coal mining was
developed to exploit the "piedras negras"
exposed in the Olmos Formation several miles
north of Eagle Pass. According to the first formal
geological survey of Texas in 1888, "five miles
northwest of Eagle Pass there is an outcrop of
coal that averages something over five feet in
thickness. There is an exposure of this coal
stratum for a distance of ten miles in Texas and
Mexico, and a large bend in the river gives Texas
the benefit of most of it" (Dumble 1888: 108).

Development of the coal mines was instigated
to a great extent by the arrival of the railroad;
by 1899 the area's coal mines were producing
150 tons per day, used almost exclusively by
the Southern Pacific Railroad (Pingenot 1971 :8).
At peak production in the early 1900s, several
mines, which were located near the current Seco
Mines, were producing a cumulative total of
2,200 tons per day (Pingenot 1971: 10). With
the discovery of oilfields in Texas and the
conversion of locomotive engines to oil based
fuel, demand for coal dropped and the mines
were closed after World War I.

to construct a large-scale gravity flow canal was
initiated, and the canal was partially constructed
in 1889 by local resident Patrick Thomson. With
government permits and favorable reports from
a U.S. Assistant Engineer and experts on the
project feasibility, Thomson tried unsuccessfully
until his death in 1910 to gain support for the
canal. In 1926 the idea finally gained sufficient
backing, and in 1932 the Maverick County
Canal, with an intake 40 miles upstream from
Eagle Pass, opened 34,500 acres to gravity flow
irrigation. The Maverick County Water
Improvement District now manages the canal
system.

IRRIGATION

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Various early accounts of Eagle Pass mention
the area's agricultural potential, which was
contingent upon irrigation. Canals had long
been used for irrigation on the Mexican side of
the river, but for various reasons, notably a
higher elevation, the Texas side was less
conducive to canal construction. The attempt

A number of previous cultural resource studies
have been conducted in the vicinity of the Rosita
Valley project area and general area. These
investigations have covered portions of the
current study area and have resulted in a number
of recorded sites in the area. To provide a general

16

Chapter 2

context of the archaeological study in the Eagle
Pass area, the following discussion is a general
overview of previous investigations in the area;
studies within or adjacent to the Rosita Valley
WWTP are discussed in Chapter 4 in the results
of the background review section.
In the early 1960s, historians Ben Pingenot, John
Woodhull, and Charles Downing identified
partially exposed stone structures that they
interpreted to be the remnants of Campbell's
Store, a historic trading post later designated site
41MV1. Facing imminent destruction by
bulldozing and continued flood damage, the
historians contacted archaeologists from The
University of Texas, who in 1965 conducted
field investigations at the site (Texas
Archeological Research Lab [TARL], site files).
At the time, an approximately 20-x-14-foot room
had already been destroyed, and within three
days, as the letter report cites, "no permanent
features will be here after bulldozing operations
except perhaps fenceposts" (TARL, site files).
The 1965 study documented and tested the ruins
of a 21-x-60-foot stone structure prior to its
destruction. The investigations found few
artifacts and documented severely damaged
structural remains. They also recorded a
collection of artifacts recovered from the site
by the ranch foreman and his wife. The artifacts
were temporally consistent with the
interpretation of the site as that of Campbell's
Store.
In 1975, 42 sites were recorded by J.P. Nunley
for the Guerrero Gateway Project along the Rio
Grande south of Eagle Pass (report is
unpublished, see Vierra 1998). Nearly all the
sites recorded during this survey are located on
the second terrace of the Rio Grande or along
Cueras Creek. This survey was one of the first
studies in the area that provided systematic
coverage of an arbitrary area, providing data for
deriving site distribution and settlement patterns.

The most extensive archaeological survey in the
area, in terms of areal coverage, was the Dos
Republicas Coal Mine Project located on the
northern side of Eagle Pass (Denney 1981;
Uecker 1994). Forty-two archaeological sites
were documented along Elm and Hediondo
Creeks and their upland tributaries. The sites
range from large campsites along the main
creeks to expedient, short-term sites in the higher
elevations (Denney 1981 ). The sites represent
occupation from the Paleoindian through the
Late Archaic time periods. Composed of burned
rock hearths, lithic debitage scatters, and lithic
tools, 13 of the 42 sites were recommended for
later testing to determine NRHP eligibility.
TWDB conducted a reconnaissance of proposed
sewer improvements in the Eagle Pass area,
recording nine sites, including site 41MV106,
an extensive open terrace site in a setting
comparable to 41MV247 on the western end of
the Rosita Valley effluent line (Hubbard and Fox
1990). The assessment found a Scallorn point,
scattered burned rock, flakes , and a possible
ground stone fragment on the site's surface
(TARL, site file). Though no intact surface
features were identified, the surveyors
recommended avoidance or testing because of
the potential for deeply buried deposits.
In accordance with TWDB 's findings and
recommendations, Mariah Associates, Inc.
conducted archaeological testing on 41MV106
for the City of Eagle Pass Wastewater
Improvement Project (O'Neill 1991). Located
predominantly along the western edge of high
Rio Grande terraces, site 41MV106 was found

features to depths of 2 m below surface. Mariah
excavated three 1-x-1-m hand-dug units (Test
Pits 1-3) and five backhoe trenches (BHTs 15) (O'Neill 1991: 13). The excavations found
four cultural features, a reworked Gower point,
and a fairly light scatter of lithic debitage and
burned rock in the upper 2 m of deposits (O'Neill

(O'Neill

basin-shaped hearths, were all identified in Test
Pit 2 ranging in depth from 160-200 cm. A
radiocarbon sample from Feature 1 yielded a
date of 1580±70 B.P., indicating a Late Archaic
occupation. In the test pits located near the Outer
Loop alignment, no features were identified.
Test Pit 1 yielded a total of 18 pieces of debitage
and one edge-modified flake in the 2-m deep
excavation (O ' Neill 1991:38). Test Pit 3
produced 189 pieces of debitage and a reworked
Gower point. The point was recovered from a
depth of 50-60 cm. The vertical distribution of
debitage is unreported. Based on the findings,
Mariah concluded the most substantial portion
of the site was located along the terrace edge in
the southeastern part of the site. The southern
site area was determined to be potentially
eligible for listing on the NRHP, though the
northern part was not eligible (O'Neill 1991 :48).
In 1995, the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT) conducted an archaeological survey
along Farm-to-Market (FM)1589 along Elm
Creek north of Eagle Pass (Ward 1995a). The
work identified a large prehistoric site,
41MV120, which extended across the terraces
of Elm Creek. Occupational debris, including
burned rock and lithic debitage, was found on
the surface. Additionally, several shovel tests
identified shallowly buried cultural remains. No
diagnostic artifacts were recovered, but further
testing was recommended to determine the
potential significance of the deposits.

Subsequent testing by TxDOT archaeologists
revealed intact cultural features to a depth of
approximately 120 cm below modem ground
surface (Ward 1995b). Features included mussel
shell concentrations and apparent pit features in
association with debitage, burned rock, charcoal,
and mussel shell. The geological assessment
identified two culture-bearing strata, including
an upper 40-cm disturbed zone and a lower intact
stratum from 40-120 cm below ground surface.

17

In 1995-96, the Center for Archaeological
Research at The University of Texas at San
Antonio conducted data recovery excavations
at site 41MV120 (Vierra 1998) on behalf of
TxDOT. Dating to the Late Archaic, the site
contains stratified components with intact
hearths, diagnostic artifacts, debitage, and faunal
remains, particularly mussel shell. Excavations
included 39 1-x-1-m hand units and six BHTs,
revealing thousands of lithic artifacts, as well
as several ecofacts. Overall, the extensive,
multidisciplinary investigations provided mixed
results; poor preservation of many types of
cultural material precluded addressing a number
of research questions that were originally
proposed. One relevant finding was the high
potential for encountering intact, stratified sites
in the alluvial sediments of the Rio Grande and
its tributaries such as Elm Creek.
Within the 41MV120 report, Hunziker
(1998 :17) provides an exanlination of previously
recorded site distributions, types, and settings
found throughout the Eagle Pass-Maverick
County region. Using data from 190 recorded
sites, Hunziker reviewed site size, type, setting,
elevation, and chronology. The study revealed
Late Archaic campsites represent the greatest
density of documented sites in the area with
lesser amounts of Archaic period and Late
Prehistoric sites. The study showed Early to Late
Archaic can1psites at varying elevations with
Middle Archaic sites more prevalent at high
elevations and Late Archaic sites at lower
elevations (Hunziker 1998: 19). Most sites occur
at elevations of 230-240 m. Larger sites appear
to be concentrated in the Rio Grande flood plain
and lower terraces below 275 m. Small sites
occur along high creeks and upland slopes, and
broad, lithic procurement sites are found on
ridgetops and upland slopes above 248 m
(Hunziker 1998). This site study suggested a
settlement pattern similar to previously proposed
patterns, namely large base camps on the lower
flood plains and streams with smaller can1psites

18

Chapter 2

and resource extraction locales in the uplands
and high creek settings (Hester 1976; Hunziker
1998).
A number of projects were conducted prior to
construction of the new international bridge and
associated port facilities (Anthony and Brown
1998; Barile and Miller 2001; Carpenter 2002;
Collins 1991; Davis and Jones 1993; Potter
1990). Except for Anthony and Brown's study,
all of these projects were surveys along the
margins of 41MV2, historic Fort Duncan; none
found intact deposits associated with the fort.
Anthony and Brown (1998) trenched and hand
excavated a historic bone and artifact scatter,
41MV237, located near the base of the
international bridge. Finding a diverse mix of
historic and modem debris, the results indicated
the material was debris deposited by several
flood events. In 2003, SWCA conducted an
archaeological survey of the Fort Duncan
National Register District to delineate the limits
of cultural resources associated with the fort
(Carpenter and Barile 2003).
In 2001, TWDB surveyed a regional water and
sewer easement east of Eagle Pass, recording
several prehistoric sites (Fox 2001; 2002) .
Among the sites identified in the study,
41MV281 is a prehistoric site similar in setting
and content to one of the sites recorded during
the current study, as discussed in Chapter 5,
along Rosita Creek. Site 41MV281 was
recorded as an extensive scatter of burned rock,
debitage, and a few mussel shell fragments
situated on the plowed terraces of an unnamed
creek (TARL, site files).
In 2000, Prewitt and Associates surveyed 176
acres along the Rio Grande, an area that was
being assessed for traditional tribe housing for
the Kickapoo (Ringstaff et al 2000). Since this
survey area overlaps the Rosita Valley WWTP
project area, the findings of this study will be

discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4 of this
report.
In 2001, Anthony and Brown (2002) conducted
an archaeological survey for proposed natural
gas pipelines. The 4-mile survey assessed three
previously recorded sites, including sites
41MV1, 41MV106, and 41MV281. Site
41MV1, as discussed above, was the original
location of Camp Eagle Pass and Campbell's
Store, established in 1849. Anthony and
Brown's (2002) surface survey and three BHTs
revealed no artifacts or other traces of the
historic occupation. Based on survey results,
archival research, and information from local
informants, Anthony and Brown (2002:20)
concluded the "limestone structure comprising
Campbell's Store was destroyed during the
1960s as part of orchard development."
Backhoe trenching on 41MV106 and 41 MV281
identified no intact or substantial deposits on
either site. Three trenches were excavated on
41MV106, none of which yielded cultural
materials. Excavation of five BHTs in
41MV281 revealed deep fine sandy loams but
no archaeological deposits, buried soils, or stable
surfaces. Accordingly, no further work was
recommended for 41 MV281.
In 2003, SWCA conducted an intensive cultural
resources survey of the proposed Eagle Pass
Outer Loop on behalf of TxDOT (Carpenter
2003). The ten sites documented in the rightof-way included historical sites associated with
early irrigation technology and prehistoric sites
representing a range of landuse patterns across
the area's different settings.
Also in 2003, SWCA conducted test excavations
on prehistoric site 41 MV287 in the Elm Creek
terraces upstream from 41MV120 (Carpenter
and Lawrence 2003). The investigations
identified isolated burned rock features in
shallowly buried contexts within or at the base
of the plow zone. Based on the lack of integrity

INTRODUCTION

FIELD INvESTIGATIONS

The cultural resources survey methodology was
designed to identify, document, and, to the extent
possible, determine the significance of
archaeological sites within the Rosita Valley
WWTP project area. Significance is generally
determined by a property's potential to contribute
to the further understanding of local and regional
history or prehistory in accordance with criteria
defined in the Texas Antiquities Code and Section
106 of the NHPA. Integrity, chronology, and
potential data yield are key criteria in this
evaluation. The methods and techniques conform
to the survey standards approved by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) and Council of
Texas Archeologists. The investigations included
background research, field investigations,
analysis, and reporting. Previous archaeological
work in the project area was discussed with D.E.
Fox, who has conducted numerous archaeological
surveys within the EPWWS area.

The fieldwork involved an intensive pedestrian
survey of the project area. Backhoe trenching,
shovel testing, and various natural and artificial
exposures were studied to determine the potential
for buried deposits. Excavations included 77
BHTs and four shovel tests. The trenches
measured from 5-8 min length, 1 min width, and
1.7-2.5 m deep. The trenches were numbered 1
through 77 in order of excavation. An
archaeologist monitored all trenching while
excavations were underway.

BACKGROUND REVIEW

An archaeological background review was
conducted to identify previous investigations and
recorded sites in the vicinity of the project area.
The review utilized site files, maps, and reports
on file at the TARL at The University of Texas at
Austin, the THC, and on the Texas Archeological
Site Atlas website. Additionally, aerial
photographs from the Texas Natural Resources
Information Services and other sources were also
utilized.

Shovel tests were excavated to ascertain the
potential for buried deposits in areas with shallow
deposits. These tests were approximately 20 cm
in diameter and excavated in 20-cm levels. Matrix
was screened through 'l4-inch mesh to recover
artifacts.
All trenches were examined by archaeologists for
cultural materials, anomalies, and geomorphic
data. Column samples were judgementally
excavated in trenches located in sites. A column
sample consisted of excavating a 20-x-20-cm
column in 20-cm levels along a trench wall and
screening the sediment through 'l4-inch mesh
screen.
Stratigraphic descriptions and
photographs were recorded for each trench.
Trench locations were plotted using local
landmarks, project maps, and a global positioning
system (GPS) unit. All trenches were backfilled
and leveled upon completion.
The intensity of subsurface investigations
exceeded the standards recommended by the THC,

22

Chapter 3

which mandates 1 trench or shovel test per 3
acres in areal surveys covering 200 acres or
more, or 16 shovel tests per mile in linear
surveys unless circumstances dictate otherwise.
Since the pipelines were either situated within
disturbed roadway rights-of-way, crossed gravel
uplands that lacked soil, or were situated in
heavily dissected areas with substantial
exposures, few subsurface investigations (a total
of five trenches) were warranted within the
pipeline portions of the survey area.
Additionally, approximately 75 acres of the 220acre plant and sludge disposal site contained
exposed gravel outcrop that lacked soils, and
thus was not trenched or shovel tested.
Accordingly, in the 145 acres with the potential
for buried deposits, 72 of the total of77 trenches
were excavated, a coverage of approximately
one trench per 2 acres.
Features identified in BHT walls or in surface
contexts were documented with drawings,
written descriptions, photographs, and profiles.
Those identified in a subsurface context were
documented, left intact and carefully reburied
for future investigations if deemed necessary.
ARTIFACT COLLECTION

All temporally diagnostic artifacts, whether from
surface or subsurface contexts were collected.
These artifacts were analyzed and submitted to
the TARL at The University of Texas at Austin
for permanent curation. Collected artifacts were
cleaned, labeled, and catalogued in accordance
with TARL standards.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

INTRODUCTION

In September and October 2004, SWCA
conducted a cultural resources survey of the
proposed Rosita Valley WWTP and related
facilities. As previously described, the proposed
project would comprise four areas of potential
effect: 1) a 2-acre Rosita Valley plant site, 2) the
1.95-km effluent pipeline, 3) the 3.25-km Rosita
Creek interceptor pipeline, and 4) a 220-acre
sludge irrigation disposal area (Figure 4.1).
Additionally, the project area includes the 4.3-km
Rosita Valley interceptor pipeline, a component
of the project area that has previously been studied
and cleared by the TWDB (Hubbard and Fox
1990), and consequently, was not part of the
current assessment.
The cultural resources assessment included a
background records review and field
investigations. The results of these investigations
are discussed here. The recorded archaeological
sites are briefly addressed in the following
sections, deferring to Chapter 5 for a more detailed
discussion of each site.

BACKGROUND RECORDS REVIEW

The background records review identified one
previously recorded site and two previous
archaeological assessments within portions of the
Rosita Valley WWTP project area. In 2000,
Prewitt and Associates surveyed 176 acres along
the Rio Grande, an area that was being assessed
for traditional tribe housing for the Kickapoo

(Ringstaff et al 2000). The study identified four
sites, including 41MV247, 41MV257, 41MV258,
and 41MV259. Since site 41MV247 is located
along the Rosita Valley wastewater treatment
effluent line and is accordingly among the focal
points of the survey, the findings of the previous
investigations are discussed in detail here. The
other sites are located within several kilometers
of the project area, but none have components
within or immediately adjacent to the project area.
41MV247 was first recorded on the basis of an
extensive surface scatter of lithic tools and
debitage on the upper Rio Grande terraces. The
assemblage included bifaces, unifaces, cores, and
a Late Archaic point (Ringstaff et al. 2000). Site
limits were defined as extending 275 m northwestsoutheast by 150 m northeast-southwest and were
considered to continue to the north beyond the
project area, which would extend into the Rosita
Valley effluent line. Subsurface investigations,
including five BHTs and 13 shovel tests, revealed
relatively sparse buried deposits. Shovel testing
likewise identified buried cultural deposits, all of
which were within the upper 60 cm of the profile,
though the majority of material was recovered
from the upper 20 cm. The trenches uncovered a
total of four pieces of debitage and a charcoalstained lens, which the investigators tentatively
identified as a hearth. The lens was a layer of
charcoal-stained sediment at approximately 30 cm
below ground surface on a stratigraphic break
between an upper brown silt and a lower yellowish
brown silt. Though two pieces of debitage were
identified in the matrix, the lack of burned rock
suggested the possibility that the staining was

natural (e.g., a burned stump or root) rather than
a cultural feature.
Based on the potential for
intact buried deposits, the site was determined
to be potentially eligible for listing on the NRHP.
Avoidance or further testing was recommended
to determine the site's eligibility (Ringstaff et
al. 2000).
In addition to Prewitt and Associates 's survey,
TWDB previously surveyed the proposed Rosita
Valley Drive Interceptor Line and a small portion
of the effluent line as part of a larger study of
water and wastewater lines in the area (Hubbard
and Fox 1990). The survey identified extensive
disturbances along the proposed line, notably
since the installation of the line would be entirely
within existing roadway. Based on these
disturbances, the proposed line was determined
to have no potential to affect intact cultural
resources.

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS

Field investigations were conducted from
September20-26 and October 14-15, 2004. The
investigations included an intensive pedestrian
survey with 77 BHTs and four shovel tests in
areas witl). a potential for buried deposits. The
survey identified three newly recorded sites
(41MV301-303) and one previously recorded
site (41MV247), a total of four sites within the
project area. The results of the field
investigations within each of the four areas of
potential effect are discussed in this section.

Vegetation in the area consists of sparse grasses
and several small, isolated mesquite. The lack
of vegetation and various natural and artificial
exposures provide high surface visibility.
Although geological maps depict the surface
geology as Cretaceous Escondido Formation, the
gravels exposed on the site are Tertiary Uvalde
Gravel deposits, which are mapped at higher
elevations to the north (Barnes 1976). No soils
are present on the majority of the area, but silty
loams, part of the Rosita Creek terraces, are
along the southern and eastern margins of the
plant site. Modem disturbances are common in
the area, including graded ranch roads along the
northern side and eastern sides, a large stock
pond and earth dam to the northwest, artificial
canals to the north and east, and agricultural
terracing throughout the area. Construction
impacts in the area would be relatively
substantial.
The field survey included a pedestrian survey
utilizing common surface and subsurface
exposures to assess the presence and potential
of archaeological sites. Lacking soils, no
subsurface investigations were conducted in the
area, although BHTs were excavated in alluvial
deposits to the north and east.
The survey identified no archaeological
materials within the plant site. The area has been
substantially disturbed by the various modem
modifications in the area, leaving no potential
for intact deposits.
WASTEWATER SLUDGE IRRIGATION TRACT

WASTEWATER TREATMEN T PLANT SITE

The 2-acre Rosita Valley Treatment Plant site,
located within the limits of the 220-acre sludge
disposal area, is situated on a gravel outcrop on
the upland slopes west of Rosita Creek (Figure
4.2). At the time of the fieldwork, the limits of
the area had been surveyed and staked.

The 220-acre sludge disposal area is an
approximately rectangular shaped property
bounded by a concrete-lined canal along the
western and northwestern side, a fenced property

100-200 m beyond the survey area along a 500m segment of the disposal area. The area is
almost exclusively open pasture consisting of
various grasses, weeds, occasional shrubs, and
several, typically small, mesquite (Figure 4.3).
The sludge disposal area covers two general
settings, gravel slopes and alluvial terraces (see
Figure 4.1 ). The gravels slopes, as discussed
for the plant site, are Uvalde Gravel deposits
that lack soils. These deposits,
which are defined by the
approximate 730-foot contour line,
cover roughly 75 acres of the 220acre area. The remainder of the area
is alluvial terraces formed by Rosita
Creek overbank deposition and
slopewash. Soils include Mavco
loam on the lower elevations along
Rosita Creek and Elindio silty clay
loam on the remainder of the area
(Stevens and Arriaga 1977).
Modem impacts in the area have
been substantial and are largely
associated with agricultural
modifications. In the 1950s and

Figure 4.3

27

1960s, according to the current
landowner Nick Carr and aerial
photographs (Figure 4.4) , an
extensive canal system was
constructed on the property for
gravity flow irrigation. The fields
were leveled, evidently with heavy
machinery, creating ubiquitous
surficial disturbances and deeper
disturbances in some areas. Other
disturbances include five fairly large
stock ponds (Figure 4.5), graded
roads, and fences. These activities,
in addition to deep root plowing,
have substantially modified the
typical profiles of many of the soils
in the project area

Effects within the sludge irrigation disposal area
would include relatively minor surficial
modifications, though deeper impacts to buried
archaeological sites would include the
permeation of organics through the soil profile.
Survey of the sludge disposal area included
pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching. In the
gravel exposures in the upland 75 acres, a

pedestrian survey was conducted, but no
subsurface investigations were made since the
area lacked soil and therefore the potential for
buried deposits. The pedestrian survey revealed
no archaeological deposits in the gravel outcrops
on the western side. However, pedestrian survey
of the upland projection on the northern side of
the project area, which likewise lacked soils
(Figure 4.6), revealed a surficial prehistoric
burned rock and lithic scatter recorded as site
41MV302. The site is discussed in detail in
Chapter 5 of this report.
The remaining approximately 150
acres of the sludge disposal area
comprises alluvial terraces that were
pedestrian surveyed, utilizing 77
BHTs and various natural and
artificial exposures to determine the
presence of archaeological
materials. The trenches, numbered
consecutively in order of
excavation, began in the northern
survey area along a minor
headwater drainage. Most trenches
encountered loams over gravels or
calcareous silts (Table 4.1 ). BHTs Figure 4.6
1 through 14 revealed a typical

The subsequent BHTs 15 through
33, 39 through 47, and 65 through
68 were placed in the upper alluvial
terraces (Figure 4. 7). The trenches
revealed a diverse set of soil
profiles, many heavily modified by
terracing. Some of the profile
diversity likely also derived from a
sludge dis- meandering Rosita Creek channel.
However, most profiles included
brown (10YR4/3) clay loams or
silty clay loams over a lower strong brown
(7.5YR5/6) or pale brown (10YR6/3) silty clay
loam with well-developed CaC0 3 concretions.
No cultural materials were identified in any of
the trenches or on the surface in the upper
terraces.
BHTs 34 through 38, 48 through 64, 69, 71, and
72 were excavated on the middle Rosita Creek
terraces, where an extensive lithic and burned
rock scatter was recorded as site 41MV303.

Figure 4.7

Backhoe trenching in terraced fields, looking northwest.

Like the previous trenches, the profiles exhibited
some variation as a result of common
disturbances. Profiles were typically similar to
the upper terrace soils, brown (10YR4/3) clay
loams or silty clay loams over a lower strong
brown (7.5YR5/6) or pale brown (10YR6/3)
silty clay loam with well-developed CaC0 3
concretions. The vast majority of the materials
within the site are surficial deposits, though two
trenches encountered buried deposits. The site
and positive trenches are discussed in detail in
Chapter 5.
EFFLUENT LINE

The effluent discharge line, extending 1.95 km
from the WWTP to the outfall into the Rio
Grande, would consist of a 24-inch diameter
sanitary sewer pipeline installed by open-trench
construction. Beginning at the plant site, the
alignment runs southwest for 750 m, crossing
gravel uplands on cleared, undeveloped land.
The line crosses to the southwest side of Rosita
Valley Drive and continues for 350 m within
existing roadway right-of-way, which is
bordered by an abandoned canal. The line
subsequently turns southwest, remaining within

existing roadway along the southern
side of Rosita Gardens Street for
550 m. Beyond Rosita Gardens
Street, which dead-ends at private
property, the alignment extends 300
m between the Rosita Gardens and
Maverick Colonias before
discharges into a tributary at its
confluence with the Rio Grande
River south of the Kickapoo Indian
Reservation. Previously recorded
site 41MV247 is located along the
southern side of the alignment on
the upper Rio Grande terraces in this
segment of the line.

Survey of the Rosita Creek
Interceptor included a pedestrian survey with
seven BHTs, all of which were located on the
southwestern end of the line. The vast majority
of the line is heavily disturbed by existing
roadway, buried utilities, and irrigation canals.
The survey utilized substantial surface and
subsurface exposures along existing roadway
and the northeastern end. Based on these
exposures and the lack of soils in the gravel
uplands, shovel testing or backhoe trenching was
not warranted along most of the effluent line,
except, as mentioned, the 300 m at the
southwestern end.
The northeastern 750 m of the line crosses
exclusively upland Uvalde gravel deposits that
have no potential for buried cultural materials.
Most of this segment of the line has recently
been graded or bulldozed. Other disturbances
include a large artificial stock pond west of the
WWTP site, ranch roads, and fences. The
various modifications provide extensive surface
exposure. The pedestrian survey revealed no
cultural materials along this segment.
The portions of the effluent line along Rosita

buried utilities and irrigations canals. The
modern developments have substantially
modified the area, resulting in a negligible
potential for intact deposits . No cultural
materials were observed in the irrigation canal
berms and other common exposures along the
roads.
The southwestern 300 m of the effluent line
easement cross deep alluvial Rio Grande terraces
and the margin of previously recorded site
41MV247. On October 14-15, 2004, SWCA
met with project surveyor Martine Parilla to
clearly delineate the project area, and
subsequently surveyed the line using seven
BHTs to assess the potential for subsurface
deposits. The survey revealed the right-of-way
is partially disturbed by an overhead utility line,
a two-track road, a fence, buried water lines,
agricultural berm, and a modern structure
foundation. The fence and the overhead utility
run along the southeastern easement boundary.
The two-track road runs through the center of
the right-of-way; a second road is located south
of the fence. The foundation, which consists of
a poured concrete slab with protruding rebar,
appears to be a relatively recent house
construction that was begun but never
completed. No parts of the superstructure (i.e. ,
walls, roof) are present. The water line, a
modem PVC pipe, was likely built to supply
water to the house foundation. A second
foundation, as well as a brick water storage tank,
is located near the southwestern end of the line,
but both are outside of the right-of-way. The
water storage tank, possibly a historic structure,
is discussed in more detail below.
The findings of the BHTs and surface survey on
the southwestern end in the vicinity of
previously recorded site 41MV247 is discussed
in the following Chapter 5. Generally, the
surface survey revealed a few isolated pieces of
debitage, but no concentrations or features. The
ground surface in the right-of-way is

33

predominantly disturbed by modem activities
and erosion. Seven BHTs, BHTs 78-84,
excavated in the segment likewise encountered
few cultural materials.
Although located outside of the right-of-way, a
brick water storage tank is briefly discussed here
because it is likely a historic structure. The
structure is a brick and mortar feature made
predominantly of a low-fired, sandy paste yellow
or red brick. The cistern, located about 30 feet
southeast of the limits of the effluent line rightof-way, measures approximately 20-25 feet in
diameter. Depth is unknown, but possibly
extends down to the water table. Besides brick
and concrete fragments, no artifacts clearly
associated with the cistern were identified in the
effluent line right-of-way. The structure is
somewhat dilapidated with the southern side
partially collapsed.
Previous research on similar features in the
Eagle Pass area, using information provided by
Maverick County archaeological steward John
Stockley, historian and reporter Al Kinsall, and
Roy Cooley of the Maverick County Water
Development Board, formerly with the
International Boundary Water Commission
(IBWC) suggests the feature was likely a cistern
or holding tank for water pumped from the Rio
Grande. It was probably used for agriculture
associated with a gravity flow canal system.
Similar features in the area were built in the late
nineteenth or early twentieth century. The
structure is possibly associated with the Indio
Cattle Company, which acquired much of the
land in the area around 1906. Nevertheless, the
structure is located outside the project area and
will not be affected by the effluent line
construction. However, if the current plans
change and impacts to the structure are
necessary, additional documentation and
assessment is warranted.

ROSITA CREEK INTERCEPTOR LINE

The Rosita Creek Interceptor line begins at the
WWTP site and runs along an existing road and
canal for approximately 1.3 km before crossing
a fenceline that marks the limits of the Carr
property. Subsequently, the line continues for
1.54 km along an old ranch road and canal
crossing heavily eroded toeslopes until El Indio
Highway (Figure 4.8). North of the highway,
the line crosses 0.45 km of eroded slopes west
of Rosita Creek. Vegetation along the line is
semi-open mesquite savanna with a sparse
understory of primarily acacia and prickly pear.
The lack of groundcover provides substantial
surface exposure. Additional erosional cuts
throughout the area expose subsurface profiles.
Construction impacts would involve open
trenching to variable depths within a 50-foot
wide easement.

gravels or pale brown (10YR6/3) clay loam with
abundant CaC0 3 nodules . Soils became
progressively shallow from south to north,
eventually interfingering with upland colluvial
gravels. No cultural materials were identified
in the trenches or surface exposures.
The northernmost 2 km of the line covers heavily
eroded slopes at the base of uplands. Extensive
surface and subsurface exposures were utilized
during the survey, as well as four shovel tests.
The vast majority of the area consisted of
shallow soils over gravels. One site, 41MV301 ,
was recorded along the line. The site is
discussed in the following Chapter 5. Other than
this site, no cultural materials were identified
on the Rosita Creek Interceptor line.

Survey of the Rosita Creek Interceptor included
a pedestrian survey with five BHTs and four
shovel tests. The majority of the line was heavily
eroded, providing substantial surface and
subsurface exposures that obviated the need for
shovel testing.
The southern 700 m of the line is
within the waste disposal area,
which was assessed with BHTs as
previously discussed. In this area,
the line follows an existing earthen
canal and ranch road. North of the
waste disposal area, the line passes
south and east of a large stock pond,
then continues along a canal for
approximately 600 m to the end of
the Carr property. The segment
contains moderately deep alluvial
deposits along the upland toeslopes.
Five BHTs, BHTs 73-77, were
excavated in the segment. The
trenches typically revealed brown Figure 4.8

SITE DESCRIPTIONS

INTRODUCTION

SITE SETTING

SWCA's investigations recorded three new sites
and assessed one previously recorded site for, a
total of four sites within the right-of-way. The
investigations focused on defining the limits of
cultural materials, characterizing the deposits, and
to the extent possible, discussing the potential
significance of the sites in the project area. This
chapter includes maps of site locations to facilitate
the review process; the inserts will not be included
in the generally distributed final report.

The site is situated along the western alluvial
terraces of Rosita Creek within the interior of a
prominent meander. The intermittent drainage
flows generally north to south towards the Rio
Grande about 3 km to the south southeast of the
site. Elevation ranges from 690- 710 feet above
mean sea level (famsl), which is about 10- 25 feet
above the creek. Within the project area,
vegetation includes almost exclusively mixed
grasses in fallow agricultural fields now used for
pasture. The mixed grasses are interspersed with
isolated mesquite, acacia, and cacti (Figure 5.2).
In unmodified areas on the edge of the project area,
vegetation includes a fairly dense mesquite
overstory and an understory of prickly pear, acacia,
whitebrush, and various acacias. Site geology
includes Holocene terraces overlying caliche and
Uvalde gravels deposits. Several ranch roads run
through the site, exposing and impacting the
surficial deposits.

41MV303
Site 41MV303 is an extensive, predominantly
surficial, prehistoric occupational site on the
Rosita Creek terraces located on the southern
margin of the sludge disposal area (Figure 5.1 ).
The site is situated on the edge of artificially
terraced agricultural fields that have been
extensively modified during the second half of the
twentieth century by leveling and the construction
of a canal system and stock ponds, modifications
that have greatly disturbed substantial portions of
the site. The SWCA investigations included an
intensive pedestrian survey, excavation of 19
BHTs, three hand-excavated column samples, and
site documentation.
The BHTs were
systematically placed in a 50- 75 m grid pattern
except where erosion or modern disturbances,
dictated otherwise. Additional trenches were
excavated in areas with dense cultural materials.

Site soils are deep loams that form the Tl terraces
of Rosita Creek. Soils become thinner
progressively upslope until gravel outcrop is
exposed in the higher elevations (circa 730 famsl)
northwest of the site. Low-lying soils along the
drainage are generally deep, organic clay loams.
The county soil survey defines the site soils as
Mavco loam, which typically include shallow
brown loams over light yellowish brown clay loam
on a substrate of very pale brown clay loam with
approximately 25 percent calcium carbonate
masses (Stevens and Arriaga 1977). Consistent
with this profile, a typical BHT site profile
includes light yellowish brown (1 OYR6/4) silt

ARTIFACTS

Figure 5.3

Artifacts identified on the site
include projectile points, lithic tools,
debitage, mussel shell, bifaces, and
several ground stone fragments
(Table 5.2). The projectile points, which were
collected for permanent curation, include two
Frio points, one Langtry, and two untyped points,
for a total of five points (Figure 5.6). One Frio
point is a well-made from a light-colored chert
with small inclusions throughout and lacks its
distal end. The second Frio point, made of an
olive-green, partially patinated chert, is missing
small portions ofits "feet" (the basal extensions),
and is reworked along both lateral margins. The
Langtry point, made of a tan chert, is a very thin
(relative to its width), well-made point that lacks
its distal end and one of the prominent shoulders.
The two untyped points include a stemmed point
that is missing the extreme proximal portion of
the base and a reworked subtriangular point.

was noted, no charcoal fragments were
identified. No basin shape could be discerned.
The buried materials in BHT 54 were less clearly
concentrated. Several small (less than 5 cm)
burned rocks were identified at about 80 cm
below surface at the contact between an upper
light yellowish brown (1 OYR6/4) silt loam and
a lower stratum of pale brown (10YR7/3) silty
loam with abundant CaC03 nodules (Figure 5.5,
Table 5 .1 ). Additionally, several isolated burned
rock were noted in the upper stratum throughout
the profile and on the surface surrounding the
trench. A hand-excavated column sample was
placed along the trench, coming down on the
burned rock in profile. The column revealed
three flakes in the upper 20 cm, and three burned
rock at about 80 cm. No flakes or charcoal
staining was noted among the burned rock. It
could not be clearly determined whether the
burned rock was secondarily deposited by
moving down the profile or if the soil boundary
was the point of origination. Accordingly, the
integrity could not be determined.
Other than these features, the site consists of
various artifact scatters on the site surface, but
the patterns were not sufficiently distinct to

The lithic tools include an awl, two Clear Fork
gouges, and an end scraper. The awl, made of a
secondary core flake, was finely chipped to form
a prominent point at the distal end of the flake
(Figure 5.7). The two Clear Fork gouges are
made of a black, fine-grained silt- or mudstone
that is uncommon throughout the remainder of
the site assemblage. One was recovered from
the central part of the site, while the other was
found on an artificial berm along the eastern site

the majority of the materials are

surface indicate a stable or
degrading landform that has
resulted in mixed assemblages.
Though some surficial deposits
retain a semblance of integrity (i.e.,
clusters), erosion, bioturbation, and
artificial disturbances have
adversely affected the surface
deposits. However, the integrity of
the buried features could not be
clearly discerned in the limited
exposures afforded by the BHTs.
Accordingly, the site's eligibility for
listing on the NRHP or designation
as an SAL could not be clearly

site that have not been substantially modified
by agricultural terracing is recommended.
Otherwise, limited additional testing is
warranted to determine the significance of the
buried component of the site.

41MV302
Site 41MV302 i,s a minor prehistoric upland
camp and lithic procurement area located in the
sludge disposal area (Figure 5.8). The site
consists ofisolated lithic and burned rock debris
on a deflated gravel surface. SWCA
investigations included a pedestrian survey and
site documentation. Lacking soils , no
subsurface investigations were conducted.
SITE SETTING

The site is situated on an upland projection
overlooking the Rosita Creek terraces to the
south and east. Elevation ranges from 73 0-73 5
farnsl. Within the project area, vegetation is
sparse, consisting of mesquite, acacia,
whitebrush, cacti, and succulents. There is
minimal ground cover, and surface visibility is
high. Site geology includes sandstone of the
Escondido Formation and Uvalde Gravels. A
prominent ledge of sandstone outcrops at
approximately 725-730 feet above mean sea
level (farnsl) on the site. This material is found
on Temp Site 1 to the south used as ground stone
and hearth rocks. Site soils are mapped as
Maverick association (Stevens and Arriaga
1977), though the bedrock outcrop and gravel
deposits are common throughout the area.
Modem landscape modifications in the site area
include a ranch road and graded circular area
for turning around. A canal runs along the lower
slopes at the western edge of the site. Since the
site deposits are exclusively surficial, the road

and graded area have substantially disturbed the
site.
SITE DESCRIPTION

The site consists of small, scattered burned rock
and lithic concentrations and debitage. The
materials are diffusely distributed over an area
extending 80 rn east-west by 60 rn north-south.
Isolated lithic debris are very diffusely scattered
across the landform to the north beyond the site
limits. No diagnostic artifacts were found on
the site , and accordingly no temporal
components could be identified on the site.
FEATURES

Although no features could be identified at the
site, one eroded concentration of burned rock
and lithic was noted (Figure 5.9) . The
concentration included about 10-12 burned
rocks and lithic debitage in an approximately 4rn diameter area. No formal tools were
identified, but several possibly edge-modified
flakes were noted. The materials are heavily
eroded, and no intact deposits were identified.
ARTIFACTS

The artifact content of the site is comparatively
low and lacking in diversity, consisting of
several possibly edge-modified flakes and
debitage. No formal tools or points were found
on the site. The debitage is predominantly early
stage reduction debris associated with lithic
procurement of raw materials eroding from the
site area. The raw materials are fairly diverse,
as characteristic of the Uvalde Gravels, and
include chert, chalcedony, quartzite, jasper, and
siltstone.

to the southeast into a small gully.
No floral or faunal remains and no
buried deposits were noted.
Other than this feature , the site
consists of various artifact scatters
on the site surface, but the patterns
were not sufficiently distinct to
warrant feature designation.
Erosion has destroyed the integrity
of the vast majority of the site
deposits.

informal lithic tools, debitage, several mussel
shell fragments , and a few ground stone
fragments. The materials are relatively diffusely
distributed over an area extending 80 m northsouth by 100 m east-west. Limits of the site
extend an unknown distance beyond the project
area, particularly downstream and to the
southwest along the tributary. No temporal
affiliation could be determined since the two
projectile points collected from the site could
not be clearly typed, though one is possibly an
Early Archaic type.
FEATURES

Though few clearly intact features could be
identified, one burned rock and lithic
concentration was recorded on the site surface
(Figure 5.12). Additionally, several poorly
defined, very eroded lithic and burned rock
concentrations were noted on the sit~ surface.
The surficial burned rock and lithic feature
includes approximately 20 small, thermally
fractured rocks, a moderately dense scatter of
several hundred pieces of debitage, a few edgemodified flakes, and an untyped projectile point
in a 2-m diameter area. The feature is eroding

ARTIFACTS

Artifacts identified on the site
include projectile points, edgemodified flakes, debitage, biface fragments, and
at least one possible ground-stone fragment. The
projectile points include two untyped points
(Figure 5 .13 ). The first point, which is
associated with the previously discussed feature,
is a heavily reworked expanding stemmed point
with a slight basal concavity, and deep base/
corner notches that resulted in prominent barbs.
The raw material is a tan-colored chert that has
been heavily patinated. The second point,
missing its distal end and both shoulders, has a
parallel-sided, slightly convex base. The
debitage consists of debris from all stages of
reduction. The materials within the feature
appear to be, at least in part, the product ofbiface
reduction as evident by common flakes with
multifaceted and lipped platforms, thin and wide
bodies, and feathered terminations. The debitage
includes diverse raw materials, much of which
likely derives from locally available Uvalde
Gravel outcrops.

SITE DISCUSSION

prehistoric occupational site along the valley
margin of Rosita Creek. The site was likely a

repetitively occupied, short-term camp and
resource procurement locale. Though some
areas have a limited degree of integrity, the site
is heavily dissected and otherwise eroded
leaving no in situ deposits. Accordingly, the site
is not considered eligible for listing on the NRHP
or designation as an SAL.

41MV247

The site is located on a terrace
bordering the Rio Grande. A minor,
unnamed south-flowing tributary
runs along the north side of the site
(Figure 5.14). Site elevation is
approximately 711 famsl. Currently,
scatter on
the site setting is primarily open
pasture that has been plowed and
terraced. Within the project area,
vegetation is sparse, consisting of mesquite and
various native grasses and carrizo. A two-track
dirt road provided some surface visibility. An
irrigation canal runs along the site's north side.
Soils are Lagloria very fine sandy loam (Stevens
and Arriaga 1977), although backhoe trenching
revealed a variety of soil types in the area.
Modern landscape modifications in the site
include previous plowing, a utility line and fence
along the northwestern boundary, and two-track
dirt roads. Additionally, a small 7-x-5-m modem

Site 41MV247 was recorded by Prewitt and
Associates in 2000. The site consists
of a fairly diffuse but extensive
prehistoric lithic scatter with a possible
buried hearth, although the previous
investigators determined the feature
was likely a burned stump rather than
a prehistoric feature (Ringstaff, et al.
2000). As previously defined, the site
covered an approximately 275 m

concrete foundation is located within the rightof-way on the northwestern portion of the site.
During trench excavation, a small abandoned
water line was observed paralleling the utility
line and fence in a northeast to southwest
orientation. Natural impacts to the site include
erosion and bioturbation.
SITE DESCRIPTION

Within the effluent line right-of-way, the site
consists of very diffuse lithic and burned scatter.
During SWCA's survey, the limits of the site do
not appear to substantially extend into the
current project area. An ambiguous, shallowly
buried, thin organic lens was documented in one
of the BHTs and a single biface-thinning flake
in another. No significant or diagnostic cultural
materials were observed on the surface or within
any of the BHTs during SWCA's survey.
A total of seven trenches were excavated at 50m intervals across the site, designated BHTs 78
-84 (see Figure 5.14; Table 5.3). Column
samples were excavated on BHTs 80 and 82
(Table 5.4). The trenches typically revealed
brown (1 OYR4/3) silty loams over brown
(10YR5/3) or pale brown (10YR6/3) silt loam
with CaC0 3 nodules. BHTs 78-80, excavated
on the lower terrace or terrace slope, contained
minimal or no CaC0 3 development, whereas
BHTs 81-84, located on the higher terrace,
contain well-developed CaC03 nodules in the
lower strata of the profile. Stream-rolled gravels
were encountered in BHTs 80, 81, 83, and 84.
The gravels in BHT 84, located on the high
ground near the gate, encountered dense basal
gravels at 115 cm below ground surface.
Otherwise, where present, gravel deposits were
generally sparsely mixed throughout the strata.
The trenches revealed one flake identified at 17
cm below surface in BHT 82, and a thin
charcoal-stained lens was identified in BHT 80.

51

A column sample along BHT 82 found no
additional artifacts. The lens in BHT 82 is a 3cm thick, 140-cm long stain buried 20-23 cm
below ground surface. No cultural materials
were found in the profile or in a column sample
excavated through the stain. Lacking associated
artifacts or a distinctive basin shape, the stain
cannot clearly be interpreted as a prehistoric
feature. The previous investigations by Prewitt
and Associates on the site likewise encountered
a charcoal stain, which they suggested was a
natural feature such as a burned stump or root
(Ringstaff, et al. 2000:9).
Artifacts documented across the site by during
the 2000 survey conducted by Prewitt and
Associates included one point, 29 flakes, two
tools, and some charcoal. The only diagnostic
material collected from the surface was a Late
Archaic Desmuke point. During the SWCA
survey, no artifacts were observed on the surface
within the project area although one large bifacethinning flake was recorded within a BHT. No
other artifacts were observed.
SITE DISCUSSION

41MV247 is a prehistoric campsite on a terrace
overlooking the Rio Grande at its confluence
with an unnamed south-flowing tributary.
Though the site extends within the effluent line
right-of-way, the majority of the site is evidently
south of the project area. Due to the amount of
modem and natural disturbance including
utilities, fencing, a two-track dirt path, existing
concrete foundation, and abandoned waterline,
the portion of the site along the effluent line lacks
substantial or significant deposits. No intact
features, or diagnostic artifacts were observed
on or below the ground surface within the area.
Accordingly, within the project area, the deposits
are not considered eligible for listing on the
NRHP or designation as an SAL.

SUMMARY,

INTERPRETATIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS

On behalf of EPWWS, SWCA Environmental
Consultants conducted an intensive cultural
resources survey of the proposed Rosita Valley
WWTP and related facilities south of Eagle Pass,
Maverick County, Texas. The work was
conducted in compliance with the NHPA and the
Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities
Permit 3545. The investigations, designed to
determine whether the undertaking would affect
significant cultural resources, included a
background archaeology review and survey to
systematically identify, record, delineate and, to
the extent possible, assess the significance of
archaeological materials.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

The background review revealed portions of the
project area had previously been surveyed, and
one recorded site, 41MV247, is located within the
project area along the effluent line. Additionally,
several other recorded sites are located in the
immediate vicinity, but not within, the survey area.
Site 41MV247 is a multicomponent prehistoric
occupation situated on the Rio Grande terraces
near its confluence with Rosita Creek. The
previous investigations, conducted in 2000,
revealed shallowly-buried, intact hearths and a
diverse assemblage of lithic debris and tools.
Avoidance or additional work was recommended
to assess the significance of the deposits.
The fieldwork, conducted on September 19-26,
2004 and October 14-15, 2004, included a
pedestrian survey of the entire project area,
excavation of 84 BHTs, four shovel tests, screened

column samples from select trenches, mapping,
and site documentation.
The survey area comprises three general settings:
alluvial terraces along Rosita Creek and the Rio
Grande, uplands with gravel deposits and desert
pavement, and heavily dissected slopes along
upper Rosita Creek. Throughout the area, modem
landscape modifications have been fairly
substantial, consisting of agricultural terracing and
canal construction in the 220-acre plant and sludge
pit site, as well as roads, buried utilities, and
irrigations canals along pipeline rights-of-way. In
alluvial settings with a potential for buried
deposits, mechanical trenching was conducted to
determine the presence of buried deposits. In the
upland areas, an intensive pedestrian survey was
conducted, but the lack of soils and common
modern disturbances obviated the need for
subsurface testing.
The investigations identified a total of four sites,
including three newly recorded prehistoric sites
(41MV301-303) and the previously recorded
prehistoric site 41MV247 (Table 6.1). Site
41MV303 is a fairly extensive multicomponent
occupational site on the southern terraces of Rosita
Creek. The site includes primarily surficial
deposits, but also occasional small burned rock
features buried in the upper meter of the soil
profile. The surface deposits lack integrity.
However, though the significance of the deposits
could not be clearly determined, based on the
potential for buried intact deposits, avoidance of
the site is recommended. Sites 41MV301 and
41MV302 are heavily eroded open camps

consisting of relatively diffuse burned rock,

a substantial material assemblage, neither site
1s considered eligible for listing on the NRHP
or as an SAL. Within site 41MV247, the
proposed pipeline right-of-way has been
substantially disturbed by a ranch road, modem
concrete foundations, buried and overhead
utilities, and a fence. The pedestrian survey
identified a very light scatter of surficial burned
rock and debitage. Seven BHTs with handexcavated column samples placed through the
site yielded one flake and a shallowly buried
organic stain that could not be clearly identified
as a prehistoric cultural feature. Based on the
lack of intact or substantial deposits,
archaeological clearance is recommended within
the right-of-way through the site with the caveat
that construction impacts be carefully limited
to the easement.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTREPRETATIONS

The sites recorded in the Rosita Valley
Wastewater Treatment project area are
prehistoric open camps that reflect an
occupational continuum from the Rio Grande
terraces, up the tributary corridor of Rosita Creek
and into the uplands. Except for possibly
41MV302, all of the sites are multi-component
occupations consisting of mixed assemblages

that were deposited, for the most part, on stable
to degrading geomorphic surfaces. Heavily
patinated Archaic artifacts recovered from the
site surfaces, most notably on 41MV303, are
evidence of long-term surficial exposures, a
setting that generally results in mixed
assemblages. All diagnostic artifacts indicate
Archaic occupations, though other unidentified
temporal components might also be present.
Differences in site assemblages relative to
geographic position on the landscape are evident
in Rosita Valley WWTP project area sites, a trend
reflected in regional patterns as documented by
Hunzicker (1998) based on Maverick County
site data. Larger camps, marked by diverse
feature and artifact types, are consistently
located along lower elevation terraces, notably
along confluences of the Rio Grande and its
prominent tributaries. Moving up the landscape
to higher elevations, sites tend to be marked by
a decrease in the range of assemblage variation
and feature type, indicating more specific,
limited-activity occupation in upland areas.
Among the Rosita Valley sites, the lower terrace
sites 41MV303 and 41MV247 (though it lies
predominantly outside of the right-of-way) are
larger base camps with relatively diverse artifact
and feature assemblages compared to the limited
archaeological assemblage from 41MV301 and
41 MV302, which are located at relatively higher
elevations.

Summary, Interpretations, and Recommendations

A number of settlement, "mobility", and site
distribution models have been proposed using
regional databases from south Texas to explain
the site patterns observed in the Rosita Valley
project area. These include a "base-satellite"
or savanna adaptation model by Hester (1976,
1981 ), a model based on the utilization of both
ephemeral and perennial water resources by
Shafer and Baxter (1975), a "linear site" model
by Lynn, Fox, and O'Malley (1977), and an
ethnohistorical model by Campbell and
Campbell (1981). All of the models describe a
similar process: primary settlement near riparian
zone resources with cyclical dispersal on a
seasonal and task-specific basis to exploit lower
density upland resources. The model proposed
by Lynn, Fox, and O'Malley (1977) is an
interpretation of extensive, undifferentiated
scatters of occupational material along creek
terraces, which accurately describes 41MV303.
The authors suggest the inhabitants returned on
a cyclical, perhaps seasonal, basis to the same
spots. This pattern eventually created an
archaeological record described as "linear sites"
composed of multiple overlapping occupational
remnants along riparian corridors. Site
41MV303, which likely continues for some
distance downstream beyond the project area,
is part of a linear site that extends along Rosita
Creek.
In terms of temporal distribution, diagnostic
artifacts recovered from the sites indicate Middle
to Late Archaic occupations.
The greater
frequency of Middle to Late Archaic
components relative to other time periods is
consistent with broader patterns in the area. In
a review of the recorded sites in Maverick
County, Hunzicker (1998:18-19) reports 36
percent are assignable to the Late Archaic, 23
percent to the Middle Archaic, and 19 percent
each to the Late Prehistoric and Early Archaic
periods. However when factored as component
frequency per 1,000 years, the study shows Late
Prehistoric and Late Archaic components almost

57

statistically even in terms of frequency of
occurrence (Hunziker 1998 :20).
Based on the current level of investigation, the
site interpretations remain fairly general. In part,
the problem of "mixed assemblages" limits the
ability to isolate discrete cultural components.
Nevertheless, the data adds to an understanding
of the area's prehistory.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Contingent upon avoidance of potentially
significant areas within site 41MV303 and
limiting construction impacts to the proposed
pipeline right-of-way through site 41MV247,
SWCA concludes that the project will have no
adverse affects on significant cultural resources.
On October 14, 2004, SWCA and Tetra Tech
project surveyors delineated the boundaries of
41MV303. Using a survey grade GPS, the site
was plotted and will be avoided in all phases of
construction and operation of the facilities. In
accordance with these stipulations and actions,
it is recommended that the Rosita Valley WWTP
be allowed to proceed with no further
archaeological work.
