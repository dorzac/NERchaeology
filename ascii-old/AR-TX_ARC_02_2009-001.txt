ABSTRACT
The City of Plano intends to construct a soft trail with three bridge
crossings adjacent to Rowlett Creek in the Oak Point Park and Nature
Preserve. The intensive pedestrian survey conducted by AR Consultants,
Inc. of the high potential areas along Rowlett Creek as well as of the low
potential areas of the slopes above the floodplains did not identify any
prehistoric or historic cultural resources. Due to the lack of cultural
resources identified during this and previous studies, ARC recommends
that construction of the soft trail and three bridges proceed, and that no
further investigations are warranted within the Oak Point Park and Nature
Reserve boundaries. In the unlikely event that buried archaeological
deposits are encountered during construction, work in the immediate area
should cease and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be consulted.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Plano intends to construct a soft trail with three bridge crossings along
Rowlett Creek in the Oak Point Park and Nature Preserve in Plano, Texas. The 800-acre
park is bound by Jupiter Road to the south, Spring Creek Parkway to the west, and Los
Rios to the northeast (Figure 1). In December 2004, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an
evaluation of the property within the park boundaries to determine the potential for
cultural resources. During the evaluation, AR Consultants, Inc. identified areas of high
potential for prehistoric cultural resources, which were the approximate four miles of
overbank levee and elevations above flooding along Rowlett Creek (Todd and Trask
2004). Low potential areas identified were the slopes and floodplain of Rowlett Creek.

Figure 1.

Oak Point Park and Nature Reserve located in southern Collin County.

Since the soft trail and bridges will impact areas recommended for further testing in
2004, the City of Plano contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. to conduct an
archaeological survey and shovel testing of the high potential areas along the creek, and
per the request of the Texas Historical Commission, limited shovel testing on the slopes
above the floodplain where roadways were not present. The purpose of the archaeological
survey was to determine if cultural materials were present, make recommendations about
their eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places and to determine how they
might be impacted by construction.
Since the City of Plano is a political entity of the State of Texas, relevant state legislation
is the Antiquities Code of Texas (Section 191). Texas Antiquity Permit Number 5123
was issued for the archaeological survey. In addition, the proposed trail and bridge
construction are to be placed adjacent to Rowlett Creek and relevant federal legislation
includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and
Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

Collin County lies in North Central Texas, specifically within the Blackland Prairie
region of Texas (Diamond, Riskind, and Orzell 1987: Figure 1). The eastern portion of
the county is drained by the East Fork of the Trinity River, and the western portion is
drained by the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Narrow bands of bottomland forest are
confined to the drainages throughout the county. The study area is located in the eastern
floodplain of Rowlett Creek in the southern part of the county which drains into the East
Fork of the Trinity River.
Rowlett Creek is mapped as having Quaternary aged alluvium floodplain and channel
deposits adjacent to the creek which consist of sand, silt, and gravel. The park area is
underlain by the Upper Cretaceous-aged Austin Chalk deposits which contains chalk
interbedded with calcareous clay (Bureau of Economic Geology 1991).
Soils in the floodplain of the proposed park are mapped as the Trinity-Frio association,
which consists of deep, nearly level clayey and loamy soils while the upland and upland
slopes are classified as belonging to the Ferris-Houston association, which is sloping to
upland clays (Hanson and Wheeler 1969: General Soils Map). Soils within the park area
are frequently flooded and occasionally flooded Frio clay and occasionally flooded
Trinity clay in Rowlett Creek’s floodplain and channel (Hanson and Wheeler 1969: Sheet
53).
As indicated above, Collin County is located in the Blackland Prairie vegetative area of
Texas (Gould 1975; Kuchler 1969: Region No. 68). The bottomlands, specifically along
the drainages, contain oak and other trees. Kuchler classifies the prairie as being
dominated by Andropogon-Sipa grasses, and Gould notes that little bluestem is the
climax dominant. Various other grasses are present as well. It is believed by Lynott
(1979) and others that the prairie was inhabited once by now-absent herbivores including
bison and antelope. Certainly, deer inhabited the floodplain forest along Rowlett Creek in
the past, but the environment has changed significantly due to modern development.

CULTURE HISTORY
The history of the Collin County region can be traced to as early as 8,000 to 9,000 B.C.
and since that time, it appears to have been continuously occupied (Crook ND). The
physical evidence of past occupation in the county has been termed "cultural resources,"
and many of these resources have been of such significance that they have been
recognized, recorded and in many cases preserved (RMA/Texas 1986).
Prehistoric Native American settlement in North Central Texas began at least 10,000
years ago as attested to by the presence of temporally distinctively shaped dart points.
Very early prehistoric sites have not been recorded in the county but Paleo-Indian sites
have been reported from Denton County to the west in the valley of the Elm Fork of the
Trinity River. Nevertheless, artifact collectors report the presence of Folsom, Scottsbluff
and other Paleo-Indian points from the surface of sites in the region. The presence of
exotic, i.e., non-local, lithic resources indicates that these early people traveled a territory
where higher quality lithics were available or were involved in a system of raw material
trading. These early people hunted now extinct large game but probably also foraged off
the land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, began about 7,000 to 6,000 B.C. and lasted possibly
as late as A.D. 700 to 800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the county but
particularly along the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt
animals and gather wild plants (Lynott 1977). Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked
rock and scrapers are common artifacts found on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic
peoples continued making and using exotic cherts for dart points, but as time passed,
there was a shift toward the use of local lithics for chipped stone tools. These local
materials are described as Uvalde Gravels (Menzer and Slaughter 1971; Byrd 1971).
Small scatters of lithic debris have been recorded in upland areas throughout the county
(Lynott 1974; Hughston and Lynott 1974; Peter 1990). These sites appear to be Archaic
in age but none have been thoroughly studied.
About A.D. 700 to 800, a major change is found in the artifacts and settlement patterning
of the prehistoric sites. Sites tend to congregate along the main stem of the East Fork of
the Trinity River. This is attributed to the drying up of the smaller tributaries. During this
period, which is known as the Late Prehistoric, Caddoan pottery from East Texas appears
as trade material along with the indigenous Nocona Plain pottery. It has been suggested
that farming may have been practiced. Arrowheads appear about this same time and
apparently, the bow and arrow had been added to the hunting tools.
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of the Collin County and the North Central Texas area based on an absence
of sites with trade goods that might have been obtained from French, Spanish or English
traders (Skinner 1988). This simplistic interpretation is tied to a general drying trend and
attempts to factor in negative information generated by professional and avocational
archaeologists who have conducted numerous surveys throughout the region. There is

very little evidence of historic era Native American occupation anywhere in the county
until historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the early 1800s.
In 1845, settlers from Peters Colony moved into what is now the Plano area. The county
was established by 1846 and the county seat was at Buckner until 1848 when it was
moved to McKinney. The town was incorporated in 1873, and the first newspaper, the
Plano News, was published in 1874. The Houston and Texas Central Railway connected
Plano to Dallas. By 1888, the St. Louis, Arkansas and Texas Railway Company
intersected the Houston and Texas Central Railway making Plano a good market for
Blackland farmers. Plano had a population of approximately 1,200 people by 1890 along
with six churches, two cotton gins, three schools and two newspapers. Plano continued to
grow from people living and working in Dallas, and by 1990, it was a city that contained
128,713 people (Schell and Wells 2003:1).
Recent Investigations
According to the Texas Archeological Site Atlas (TASA 2009), two sites along Rowlett
Creek (41COL88 and 89) are located north of the study area and were recorded in a study
conducted for the City of Allen’s wastewater project. Site 41COL88 was a historic
farmstead and 41COL89 is a historic cemetery. South of the study area, several sites have
been recorded along Rowlett Creek. AR Consultants, Inc. (Skinner 1999) recorded a
lithic and fire-cracked rock scatter, the Black Shoe site (41DL384), a lithic and firecracked rock scatter along with mussel shells and bones, and a historic residence site
(41DL386) adjacent to Rowlett Creek and in the Firewheel Golf Course in the City of
Garland. Site 41DL29 was discovered during a Texas Department of Transportation
archaeological survey and it consists of an Archaic lithic scatter (TASA 2009).
Interestingly, these sites are located on limestone knolls or ridges above Rowlett Creek
and not in its floodplain.
The uppermost terraces and part of the floodplain of Spring Creek southwest of its
conjunction with Rowlett Creek was investigated by Geo-Marine, Inc. (Buysse et al.
1998) for the Firewheel Golf Course as well, but no archaeological sites were found. AR
Consultants (Skinner and Whorton 1994) conducted an archaeological survey of 248
acres on both sides of a tributary to West Rowlett Creek, but did not locate any
prehistoric cultural material. PBS&J (Sills and Cliff 2003) discovered a buried Late
Archaic site in a natural levee of Rowlett Creek south of its conjunction with Spring
Creek. The site was buried approximately 3 meters deep and dated to 2180+40 B.P., with
a 2-sigma calibrated age of 110 to 370 B.C. (Beta-173456). Within the proposed park
area, AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd, Trask and Jennings 2004) excavated five backhoe
trenches within the Rowlett Creek’s eastern floodplain for the 15-acre Los Rios Lake.
Depths of the trenches ranged from 1.97 to 3.91 meters, but no cultural materials were
found.
North of the study area in Allen, AR Consultants (Skinner and Skinner 1996) discovered
site 41COL194, a tenant house, and 41COL195, a brick lined cistern in an archaeological
survey of Allen Station Park, which is located adjacent to Cottonwood Creek. A

limestone dam with an associated pump foundation and a limestone foundation to a water
tank were found associated with the dam and the remnants of a concrete dam built in
1912 also were discovered. The limestone dam was revisited and investigated further by
AR Consultants, Inc. (Skinner 2002). Soil was removed from the dam and the total length
of the dam was investigated. The dam was built in 1874 by the Houston & Texas Central
Railroad to provide water for its steam engines.
A review of the 1930 soil map for Collin County (USDA 1930) and the 1939 General
Highway Map for Collin County (Texas State Highway Department 1939) determined
that no historic residences were located adjacent to Rowlett Creek. Conversations with
various collectors and especially Mr. John McGraw, former president of the Collin
County Archeological Society and district judge, indicated that cultural materials were
not found on uplands adjacent to Rowlett Creek in the proposed park area, but along the
creek and in the creek’s banks.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Previous investigations along Rowlett Creek have primarily identified historic
archaeological sites, with few prehistoric sites recorded near the study area. Historic
cultural resources near the study area include farmsteads, cemeteries, and residential
sites. Prehistoric sites recorded contained lithic and fire-cracked rock scatters with some
mussel shell and bone present.
Based on the previous investigations along Rowlett Creek (Todd and Trask 2004), the
first hypothesis suggests that prehistoric, seasonally based campsites may be present on
elevations above flooding such as overbank levees and small knolls within the Rowlett
Creek floodplain. The overbank levees are recent Quaternary alluvial deposits that have
developed along the edges of the creek. The levees range from 0.5 to 1.5 meters (m) in
height and 2 m wide, while the knolls are 50 to 100 m in diameter and are approximately
1 m in height. Due to extensive construction of roadways and housing developments
outside the park boundaries, the section of the Rowlett Creek running through Oak Point
Park and Nature Reserve has experienced extensive erosion -- up to a meter over the last
year -- along the creek banks (Ron Smith, personal correspondence, 2009). The Soil
Conservation Service shows the soils mapped in the park area as floodplain and upland
slope soils, with no terraces mapped within the park boundaries. Due to the presence of
floodplain soils and the highly active nature of Rowlett Creek, it is predicted that few
intact cultural deposits remain on these elevations above flooding due to the extensive
erosion that has occurred along the creek banks.
The second hypothesis suggests that the potential for intact historic cultural resources is
low, yet archival research conducted during previous investigations along Rowlett Creek
has demonstrated that Collin County, specifically the Plano area, has been occupied since
the mid-19th century. It is possible, but not likely, that the remains of 19th or 20th century
structures, cisterns, or trash accumulations in gullies along the creek may be present.
Methodology
The trail route meanders along the banks of Rowlett Creek. The four mile, 100 foot wide
route was walked by a two person crew in parallel transects. Shovel tests were conducted
within the high potential areas along the flagged trail route as recommended by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (2002) and were concentrated at the elevated overbank
levees and knolls and at the three bridge crossings, which were staked. Due to the
shallow impact anticipated from the soft trail, shovel tests were excavated to
approximately 35 cm below surface except on the banks where the bridges are to be
placed, and shovel tests were supplemented at these bridge crossing by augering to below
1 m. The pilings are to be installed 3 feet (a meter) below the surface. The clay matrix
was broken manually and inspected and the pit walls were inspected for cultural material.
Notes on the terrain, vegetation, soil and other relevant information were taken as were
photographs. Backhoe trenches were not excavated due to the shallow depth of the
impact by the soft trail, and the lack of evidence for buried deposits from trenching at the
location of Los Rios Lake within the park boundaries (Todd, Trask and Jennings 2004).

RESULTS
This chapter of the report is divided into three sections; the first section presents the study
area, and the second section describes the intensive pedestrian survey conducted within
the park from north to south of the elevations the bridge locations, and the slopes above
the floodplain. The third section discusses the conclusions.
Study Area
The four miles of soft trail run roughly parallel to Rowlett Creek throughout the park
property, yet meander east and west to avoid trees and washouts along the creek banks.
Rowlett Creek has cut a sinuous path that has formed a wide channel cutting down to
limestone bedrock in several areas. On average, it is 30 m wide and 10 m deep with the
limestone exposed in the lower 2 to 3 meters of the bank profile. Regular flooding in the
park area has left piles of debris within the outwashes along the banks, and modern trash
has collected within the tree limbs. Vegetation along the banks of the creek is moderate to
dense, with some large (over 75-year old) bur and post oaks as well as younger
hackberry, bois d’arc, mesquite and ash trees close to the creek. Small growths of eastern
red cedar are along the slopes outside the floodplain. Numerous erosional gullies and
washouts dissect the banks of Rowlett Creek and recent flooding has eroded the bank
severely; many large trees have lost their ground at the banks and are near collapse
(Figure 2).

Ground visibility varied within the study area. On the trail route, it was between 70 and
100 percent as it had been cleared of vegetation and pin-flagged; grass and fallen leaves

on the elevated areas provided more cover and ground visibility was less than 30 percent
on the knolls and levees. At the time of the pedestrian survey, it was noted that vegetation
had been cleared and construction of paved foot trails had begun in the floodplain and on
the slopes above. These areas were identified as having low potential for cultural
resources during the 2004 evaluation and required no additional testing.
Survey and Testing of Elevations Above Flooding
During the intensive pedestrian survey conducted on January 29 and 30, and February 2
2009, the entire trail route was surveyed and the surface examined for cultural material.
Forty-four shovel tests were excavated within the high potential areas shaded red on the
following map (Figure 3). Seventeen shovel tests were also excavated in areas identified
as having low potential for cultural resources; these areas were the slopes above the
Rowlett Creek floodplain. Details of all the shovel tests results are in Appendix A.

The survey began at the trail entry point north of Jupiter Road. Of the three elevations
above flooding identified during the 2004 study, two elevations were relocated, while the
third northernmost location appeared to have been impacted by erosion and was no
longer present. Park property in the northwestern section was heavily eroded with
numerous washouts and gullies; tree roots were exposed in the creek banks (Figure 4).
Eight shovel tests (JC17-24) were excavated to 35 cmbs in very dark brown clay or
loamy clay, and all were negative for cultural material.

South of Jupiter Road and north of Bridge Crossing 3, ten shovel tests (JC5, ID5, JC1516, JC23-24, JC28-29, JC32, and ID27) were excavated at four elevated locations on the
east and west sides of the creek. The elevations were generally low, between 1 and 2 m in
height, and gently sloped away from the creek towards the floodplain (Figure 5). Very
dark grey brown clay was encountered on the west bank, while dark gray brown sandy
loam with coarse gravels was encountered on the east bank just south of Los Rios Blvd.
No cultural material was noted on the surface nor was any encountered in the shovel
tests.

South of Bridge Crossing 3, seven shovel tests (JC13-14, 30-31, ID16, 25-26) were
excavated at three of the four elevations previously identified. Erosion from the creek’s
flow at the fourth location had cut into the bank causing the levee to collapse. Figure 6 is
a view of the creek with the eroded areas showing on the right bank. The remaining
elevated knolls were located at the edge of the floodplain. The soils excavated ranged
from dark to very dark brown clay and all were negative for cultural material.

At the south end of the park north of Parker Road, four elevated locations were surveyed,
yet only two knolls were shovel tested (JC10-12 and ID10-15). The two locations not
tested were in open fields away from the creek and ground clearing for construction of
the concrete park trail had occurred before the survey (Figure 7).

Testing at Bridge Locations
The three proposed bridges are where the soft trail crosses feeder channels that ultimately
flow into Rowlett Creek. At the northern most location, Bridge Crossing 1, there is a
shallow pond adjacent to the trail. The pond appears to be man-made, as the banks appear
to be berms of a stock pond (Figure 8). Ground visibility was excellent, and the clay was
mottled on the surface. Four shovel tests (ID3-4 and JC3-4) were excavated in the dark
grayish brown and yellowish brown clay, two on each bank, to depths between 47 and
110 cm. The drainage was approximately 4 m wide and 1.5 m deep. The water table was
encountered at 47, 50 and 55 cm in three of the shovel tests. No cultural materials were
found in the shovel tests nor were located on the surface.

Figure 8.

Shallow pond located northwest of Bridge Crossing 1.

Bridge Crossing 2 is east of Spring Creek Parkway and is approximately 50 meters
southwest from the first channel crossing. Ground visibility was excellent, and two
shovel tests (JC33-34) were excavated in the trail corridor and on each bank of the
drainage. The channel was approximately 3 m wide and less than 1 m deep with no water
present. No cultural materials were found in the shovel tests nor were any located on the
surface of the trail.
South of Los Rios Lake in the center of the park is the proposed location for Bridge
Crossing 3. The bridge will cross a 20 m wide and 8 m deep feeder stream that flows
directly into Rowlett Creek. The banks of the stream were relatively steep and no distinct
soil horizons were visible. The banks of Rowlett Creek were examined for cultural
material. Two shovel tests supplemented by augering were placed on each bank of the

feeder stream (JC1-2 and ID1-2) and excavated to depths of 130 and 165 cm respectively.
These shovel tests were between 5 and 10 m from the banks of Rowlett Creek. The very
dark grayish brown clay topsoil was approximately 60 cm thick and was followed by
dark grayish brown loamy clay B-horizon. No cultural materials were located in the
shovel tests nor were seen in the banks of Rowlett Creek or of the feeder channel.
Testing of Slopes above Rowlett Creek
Five locations (labeled T1-5 on Figure 3) along the slopes, which were approximately 10
to 15 feet above the floodplain, were examined for evidence of cultural material. Three of
these locations were shovel tested. The first slope (T1) is in a wooded area south of Los
Rios Lake and overlooks Rowlett Creek to the south. Nine shovel tests (JC25-27 and
ID17-22) were excavated to a depth of 35 cm in the dark gray brown clay and were
negative for cultural material.
No shovel tests were placed at the T2 and T3 locations. T2 is north of Los Rios Lake and
has been cleared and leveled for the construction of a concrete foot trail. In addition, an
existing transmission line route passes east of the concrete trail. T3 is located west of Los
Rios Road and also was graded and leveled (Figure 9).

At the south end of the park, T4 is north of Parker Road and the relatively level terrain
overlooks the east bank of Rowlett Creek. Four shovel tests were placed along the slope
(JC8-9 and ID6-7). Soils were very dark gray brown clay loam and dark gray brown clay
and were sterile for cultural material. The final low potential area tested, T5, was located
east of Spring Creek Parkway and the topsoil appeared heavily eroded. Four shovel tests
along the slope were excavated to a minimum depth of 35 cm. Dark grey brown clay
mottled with yellow brown clay subsoil was encountered between 27 and 50 cmbs. No
cultural material was located in the shovel tests or on the surface.
Conclusions
Two hypotheses were presented in regards to the potential for prehistoric or historic
cultural resources within Oak Point Park and Nature Preserve. It was predicted that
prehistoric sites might be present on the knolls and levees, which were previously
identified as high potential elevations above the floodplain. Conversely, evidence for
historic occupation was predicted to be present as the remains of structures or trash
accumulations in gullies along the creek.
Despite the presence of prehistoric and historic sites north and south of the park area, no
prehistoric or historic cultural materials were located along the upper reaches of Rowlett
Creek. The lack of prehistoric cultural resources is most likely due to the constant
deposition of alluvial deposits within the Rowlett Creek floodplain and the absence of
stable terrace deposits such as those identified further south of the study area. Based on
the rate of erosion along the banks of Rowlett Creek, it appears that the topsoil, which
may have contained cultural material on the elevated knolls and levees, would have
eroded away during recurring flooding episodes. This recurring flooding would have also
affected historic cultural material that may have once been present on the surface.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The intensive pedestrian survey conducted by ARC of the high potential areas along
Rowlett Creek as well as of the low potential areas of the slopes above the floodplains did
not identify any prehistoric or historic cultural resources. Due to the lack of cultural
resources identified during this and previous studies, ARC recommends that construction
of the soft trail and three bridges proceed, and that no further investigations are warranted
within the Oak Point Park and Nature Reserve boundaries. In the unlikely event that
buried archaeological deposits are encountered during construction, work in the
immediate area should cease and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be consulted.
