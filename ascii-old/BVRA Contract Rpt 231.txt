ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a proposed well pad site and access road in the
Brazoria National Wildlife Refuge in south Brazoria County, Texas was performed
by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on February 5, 2010. The area
investigated consisted of 6.29 acres. No archaeological sites were found, and no
artifacts were collected. The area was found to be marshy with clay at the surface.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area consists of a well pad site and access road in the Brazoria
National Wildlife Refuge in Brazoria County, Texas (Figure 1). The well pad site
is 400 feet x 400 feet, and the access road is 3800 feet long and 30 feet wide.
The project area is in a marshy area that is flat and featureless, and the nearest
bodies of water are two unnamed lakes sixty meters to the southeast and
southwest. This tract is viewed as a medium to high probability area for the
presence of a significant prehistoric site because oyster and rangia shell is often
found in similar settings, and this resource was used by the local Indians in
prehistoric times as a food source. The project area is depicted on two
topographic quadrangles. They are Christmas Point (2995-112) and Hoskins
Mound (2995-113) (Figure 2).

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This project was performed in order to identify any cultural resources that
might be present within the proposed well pad site and access roads locations.
Suemaur Exploration & Production, LLC (client) is the sponsor, and the client
wanted to make sure that no significant cultural resources will be affected by the
proposed construction. DESCO was retained by the client to perform an
environmental assessment, and BVRA subcontracted with DESCO to conduct
the current archaeological survey.
William E. Moore was the Principal
Investigator, and Phillip C. Bishop performed the field survey. The project was
carried out on February 5, 2010 and involved eight person hours.

RESEARCH DESIGN
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL and the Atlas were
checked for the presence of previously recorded archaeological sites and projects
in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting work
in Brazoria County were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of
prehistoric and historic sites found in the area. Some of the major works utilized
are reports by Biesaart et al. (1985), Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), and Moore and
Baxter (2007a, 2007b, and 2007c). The project area was investigated by a 100%
Pedestrian Survey, shovel probes, and shovel tests within the footprint of the
proposed well pad site and access road in areas where enough soil was present to
warrant this activity. Since much of the area contained clay at the surface and (in
some cases) standing water, these areas were visually observed and not shovel
tested. Photographs of the project area were taken with a digital camera.

RESULTS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed no
sites have been recorded in the project area, and a professional archaeologist had
not previously examined the tract. No archaeological sites were found during the
course of this survey. At the time of this survey, the area was covered with salt
grass. Most of the project area contained clay at the surface or less than ten
centimeters of sandy soil overlying the clay. According to the published soil survey
for Brazoria County (Crenwelge et al. 1981: Sheet 79), the project area is located
within the soil type described as Harris Clay (19), and this appears to be consistent
with what was observed in the field. This soil is described as a nearly level, saline
soil found in marshes. Typically, this is saline clay to a depth of sixty inches. It is
very dark gray and neutral in the upper part and grades to gray and moderately
alkaline in the lower part. This soil is very poorly drained, and surface runoff is very
slow. It floods occasionally during abnormal high tides. The water table is within 20
inches of the surface throughout most of the year. The native vegetation on this soil
is salt marsh, and areas containing these soils are used mainly as rangeland and
wildlife habitat.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was found as a result of this
survey. It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during the
excavation associated with the well pad or access road, all work must stop until the
THC can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in accordance with the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the THC.
