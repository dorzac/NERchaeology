EXCAVATIONS AT THE TRIPWIRE SITE

The Tripwire Site (41 CV I 05) is located in southern Coryell County, be­
tween Copperas Cove and Killeen, on Fort Hood Military Reservation. It is
situated on the west bank of Clear Creek, immediately north of the Santa Fe
rail line. The site was discovered in January 1977, during an archeological
survey of the proposed route of a water pipeline that will run from Killeen
to Copperas Cove, and was recommended for excavation since the construction
will destroy most of the small remnant that has not already been disturbed
(Prewitt 1977). A Texas Archeological Survey crew worked at the site for
12 days during the latter part of May 1977.
Site Description
Rock-bottomed, springfed Clear Creek flows northward through southern
Coryell County into House and Cowhouse Creeks, to empty ultimately into
Belton Reservoir. In places the creej( is palisaded by high limestone cliffs, but
in the vicinity of the site the less resistant Glen Rose formation has eroded
away to leave a less abrupt but still fairly steep bluff about three meters above
the present floodplain. South of the site a springfed tributary enters Clear
Creek from the west; several small sites up this stream were located during the
pipeline survey. To the south, vegetation covering the Walnut Formation lime­
stone substrate varies from juniper thickets to juniper parkland, but to the
north extensive clearing has resulted in open grassland with only scattered motts
of live oak and other species on the flat to gently rolling terrain.
As far as can be determined from a cursory examination of what is left
of the site, it formerly consisted of an elongated scatter of cultural debris ex­
tending northward along the creek bluff from the present railroad embankment.
Artifacts and chipping debris are continuously exposed in roads and gullies for
an unmeasured distance estimated to be on the order of 200 meters or more.
The site extends at least as far as the large borrow pit to the north, into
which firecracked rock and other cultural debris has been washing. At the
south end of the site the east-west exposure is about 65 meters, based on the
extent of debris exposed in a dirt road. No cultural debris has been noted
south of the railroad, though, this area has not been well searched. Figure 2
shows the southern end of the site.
In the immediate vicinity of the excavations, the site has heavy grass
cover with scattered small juniper and other trees. On the surface just north
of the railroad cut, and eroding down into the cut, angular firecracked lime­
stone fragments can be found, usually oxidized to various shades of pink or
red and often forming small clusters. These clusters of firecracked rock
suggested that intact hearths might be present at the site.

2 --

The bluff along which the site extends is heavily overgrown with live oak,
elm, buckeye and other species, as is the floodplain (Fig. 1). Back from the
bluff, motts and fmgers of live oak, elm, and juniper are interspersed with
heavy grass cover except in disturbed areas. In the immediate vicinity of the
site the terrain is flat and gently sloping toward the creek (Fig. 2).
Over 30 years of military activity has destroyed nearly all of the site.
The northern and southern ends have been removed by a borrow pit and the
railroad embankment. The intervening area is laced with roads and gullies
and has been subjected to earthmoving and dumping operations. Military
debris (such as tripwires, C-ration tins, cartridge cases, spark plugs and other
vehicle parts) is as abundant on the landscape as prehistoric debris. The
grass-covered strip immediately north of the railroad is perhaps the only sub­
stantial undisturbed area.
Stratigraphy
Four strata were exposed in a backhoe trench cut into the top slope of the
bluff, northeast of the excavations (Fig. 3). The lowest stratum is a yellowish­
buff marl of unknown thickness; over it lies a buff-colored marl about 40-70 em.
thick. Both strata are sterile. Over the buff-colored marl lies (unconformably?)
a thin (10-20 cm.) stratum of fossiliferous, moderately well sorted sub angular
to rounded limestone gravel in a matrix of yellowish-brown clay, pinching out
downslope. This stratum is believed to be the principal cultural deposit (or,
preferably, 'surface') in this part of the site and it will be discussed further in a
later section. Overlying the gravel is a colluvial stratum of Jip~ black clay loam
up to 30 cm. thick, thinning and pinching out downslope. This black colluvium
also contains cultural debris, presumably but not certainly displaced upward from
the gravel surface by biotic activity. The upper half of this zone is heavily matted
with grass rootlets.
Excavations
The area available for excavation was confined to a 40 foot wide easement
running east-west across the southern edge of the site immediately north of the
railroad cut. The area excavated is 2 x 8 meters in size, located just north of the
railroad cut where firecracked rock was exposed on the surface (Fig. 2).
The excavation grid was oriented on magnetic east-west. All elevations were
recorded relative to the top of a railroad spike driven flush with the ground about
53 m. north of the excavations; this datum was assigned an arbitrary elevation of
100.00 meters. Excavation was done in 2 x 2 ill. squares, identified by the
southeast corner grid point, and further subdivided into 1 x I m. quadrants, identified
as NW, NE, SW, or SE. Each quadrant was excavated and completely recorded
before proceeding to the next. Vertical measurements were made with a line
level from ground surface at the NW corner of the square, and each square was
excavated in two 10 em. levels. AU of level 2 for the entire area was screened

through ~- inch mesh hardware cloth. Level 1 in 9 quadrants was screened,
until the presence of a buried occupation surface was verified, after which
Level 1 from the remaining quadrants was regarded as overburden and was
discarded without screening. Rocks exposed on the surface were plotted on
a scale drawing, and rocks exposed in excavation were left in place until
the level was completed, when another scale plan was made. Artifacts were
also plotted in place where possible, although chipping debris was not.
Discussion
Excavation revealed a scattered pavement of fire cracked limestone resting on
a flat surface 18 to over 20 cm. below the present ground surface (Fig. 4).
_This surface dips gently eastward, but less so than the present surface, so
that in the easternmost square the rock layer was completely exposed at the
base of Level 2 yet was only partially exposed in the westernmost square.
Note that the density gradient between the two lower squares and the rest of
the excavated area in Figure 4 is due to this differential exposure. The pre­
vailing slope near the excavations, together with the apparent eastward thin­
ning of the black clay loam indicates this colluvium was derived from the
area upslope and to the west.
The easternmost square (N lOO/W92) is the only unit in which this collu­
vium was completely removed and the underlying gravel zone partially penetrat­
ed. Here it became apparent that the rock layer rests on the surface of the
gravel deposit and that this was the occupation surface associated with the
cultural debris. In this same square much more debris was found on this sur­
face or in the upper few centimeters of the gravel than in the overlying col­
luvium. Clearly then, the upper contact of the gravel is an actual 'living surface'
with artifacts and chipping debris introduced in the upper portion most likely
by foot traffic, or perhaps minor post-occupational biotic disturbance. Artifacts
'A' through 'D' (Fig. 4) were found in the upper part of the gravel. Presumably
if
- - - the gravel had been excavated in the three westernmost squares, considerably
more cultural debris would have been recovered. Chipping debris in Level 2
becomes progressively more abundant from west to east as stratigraphically
lower portions of the colluvium are sampled:

with variable elevation and orientation and are presumably displaced upward from
the occupation surface by biotic disturbance. There is no evidence of reoccupation
of the site during deposition of the colluvium.
The origin of the gravel zone is unclear, whether it is due to sheetwashing
and weathering of limestone beds upslope or to stream deposition; it appears too
fine grained to represent a Pleistocene bed load deposit from a stream the size
of Clear Creek. In any case, its deposition predates the occupation, for none of
the artifacts or chipping debris show any evidence of stream rolling, and (tenta­
tively) debris seems to be absent below the upper few centimeters of gravel.
The pavement of firecracked limestone presumably represents an unconfined
dump area for hearthstones broken into pieces too small for further use. No
evidence of in situ firing, in the form of charcoal or oxidized matrix was
uncovered. We did not systematically observe the orientation of oxidized rock
surfaces, but my impression is that orientation was approximately random.
ARTIFACTS

Except for the firecracked rock, all the prehistoric cultural debris at the
Tripwire Site represents three kinds of activities: I) repair of broken or worn
out tools, 2) manufacture of new tools, and 3) expedient use of otherwise un­
modified tools. Tool repair: is suggested by dart point proximal fragments, pos­
sibe uniface retouch flakes, and fragments with dorsal ridge polish. Although
the point fragments have not been reworked, they were presumably unhafted
after impact and discarded at the site, and are regarded as repair debris. Tool
manufacture is indicated by biface failures and chipping debris-chiefly from--~
the final stages of biface thinning. Edge damaged flakes indicate expedient
tool use in scraping tasks.
Most of the Tripwire collection, including the chipping debris, has been ex­
amined under a binocular microscope at ID-70x. This proved quite profitable,
for many of the edge damaged flakes, both polished flake fragments, and two
of the uniface retouch flakes were discovered this way.
In the following descriptions, letter designations (eg. 'Specimen A') in the
text correspond to those in Figure 4.

of it; stem is the same width as the blade; the base is concave. Side notches
are heavily ground, and grinding extends just past basal comers onto base.
It resembles an Ensor type somewhat but broad notches, narrow blade and
indistinct shoulders are atypical. The small projections on the blade edges
show slight edge rounding at 70x magnification, but are very indistinct.
Provenience: NlO1.35!W93.33, elevation 100.49, gravel deposit.
Specimen B (Fig. 5) is made of grayish-white chert with an expanding stem
and slightly concave base. One stem comer has small burin facet which is prob­
ably haft damage due to impact. The opposite stem comer has small flake
removal. There is no visible edge modification at 70x magnification. It falls
within the range of the Lange type.
Provience: NI01.65!W93.30, elevation 100.52, gravel deposit.
Both of these points have identical blade fractures, a transverse hinge fracture
produced by pressure unequally applied to one face of the point. Similar but
less well developed fractures can be experimentally produced by gripping a point
in a bench vise and applying lateral force to one face of the specimen. According
to Milton Bell (personal communication) fracturing frequently occurs when a
point becomes imbedded in the ground on impact, and the weight of the shaft,
once its forward motion is arrested, acts as a lever to snap the point near the
end of the haft. The result is a fracture of the kind exhibi ted by both of these
specimens. Tentatively, then, these are regarded as impact fractures rather than
manufacturing failures.
Unidentified Paleo-Indian point fragment (Fig. 5). This basal ftagment has key
attributes that mark it unquestionably as a Paleo-Indian point, but it is too frag­
mentary for identification. It is made of non-local dark gray material with a
semivitreous luster; the surface is covered with very small pits which, under 70x
magnification, appear to be textural irregularities rather than inclusions. The
sides of this fragment expand slightly toward the distal end; the base is concave,
--'!!lei heavy grinding occurs on the sides with somewhat less grinding on the base.
Both stem comers are slightly damaged. In cross-section it is thin and lenticulfl!,t
very well made with edges carefully trimmed by minute pressure flaking. The
fracture is probably due to impact. This specimen could correspond to several
different Plano Complex point types. Even though it seems too small and relatively
narrow, it may be a Plainview point fragment. Basal width is 15.9 mm., maxi- . ­
mum thickness 4.1 mm. Provenience: general surface.
Distal Biface Fragments
Specimen C (Fig. 5) is made of grayish-white chert, is well made and has an
oblique spiral fracture. No edge damage is visible at 70x magnification except for
slight edge rounding on one edge adjacent to the fracture. It appears to be a
finished artrtact which may have been broken during use..
Provenience: N 10 1. 15/W9J. n, elevatIon 100.51, gravel deposit.

_ _10
Specimen D (Fig. 5) is made from a pink calcareous chert, possibly heat­
treated and percussion thinned. It has an oblique spiral fracture, with subsequent
burin facets along one edge and the adjacent portion of the fracture. No edge
modification is visible at 70x magnification.
Provenience: NIOO.99/W93.23, elevation 100.48, gravel deposit.
Specimen L (Fig. 5) is made from gray, grainy textured chert; slight edge
rounding visible at 70x
be due to the nature of the material
to attrition through use. The distal end is asymmetrical. It has
been percussion thinned, the edges are untrimmed and it has a transverse snap
Provenience: i N 100!W92, NE quadrant, Level 2.
Medial Biface Fragment
Only one specimen was found (Fig. 5). It is made of grayish-tan chert
and is well thinned on one face only. Provenience: general surface.
Possible Uniface Retouch Flakes
Three small fragments (Fig. 5) apparently from three different artifacts were
found which have remnants of unifacially retouched edges. The scale of the
retouch is such as to suggest it represents intentional pressure or percussion
flaking. These resemble uniface retouch flakes described by Shafer (1970),
except that all three removals appear to have been unsuccessfuCand none of the
the detachment methods correspond to those described by Shafer.
The first example (Fig. 5 ) has been detached by a blow delivered head-on
to the retouched face, so that the only surviving remnant of the working edge
is the striking platform remnant, about 3 mm. across. Under magnification
extreme rounding and crushing of the working edge is visible, and back from
the edge the retouch scar ridges and facets appear somewhat polished. This is
the most thoroughly worn of the three specimens. Working edge angle cannot
be measured but appears very steep.
The second specimen (Fig. 5 ) appears to represent one comer and a section
20.4 mm. long of the distal end of an end scraper. The flake was detached by
a blow delivered to a sloping lateral facet where it joined the retouched end
of the scraper. This may have been an attempt at burin detachment of the
working edge (retouch method A, Shafer 1970: 481-484) but if so, would
have been unsuccessful without further trimming since'removal of the flake
only undercut the edge. Under magnification the working edge appears
thoroughly crushed, but not smoothed or polished. Working edge angle is 72~
The third specimen is the distal end of a snapped flake that was detached
by a blow delivered somewhere near the proximal end of the scraper. The
resulting flake hinged through, carrying away an II mm. long section of the

step flaking along the working edge but little crushing and no polish. Working
edge angle is 73~
Provenience: N100/W92 NW quadrant, Level 2; NIOO/W98 NE quadrent, Levell;
NIOO/W94 NE quadrant, Level 2.
If these three specimens are indeed rejuvenation flakes, they all appear to
be unsuccessful or at least inefficient.
Flake Fragments With Dorsal Ridge Polish
Two flake fragments of patinated gray-white chert have polished dorsal
ridges, with some polish on intervening facets. Thickness of the flakes is
comparable to that of thinning flakes.
Provenience: N100/W94 SW quadrant, Level 2; NIOO/W96 NW quadran t;
Level 2.
These may be rejuvenation flakes from artifacts used to process moderately
yielding substances.
Manufacturing Debris
Items D and L and the medial biface fragment were described above for
convenience but are considered manufacturing debris.
Biface Rejects and Failures
Specimen E (Fig. 5) is a small oval biface of gray-white chert, which has
been percussion thinned and was probably rejected because of its small size.
Provenience: NlOI.66/W93.87, elevation 100.47
Specimen F (Fig. 5) was made on a large gray, chert, heavy-percussion
(secondary cortex) flake; a few abrupt heavy percussion flakes were removed
from the ventral side, fewer still from the cortex side before the flake was
discarded without further attempts at thinning.
Provenience: NIOO.22/W95.32, elevation 100.60, colluvium.
Specimen G (Fig. 5) was made on a large, coarse-grained white chert flake
fragment, it has been percussion thinned primariiy on the dorsal side. The
oblique transverse snap may have occurred during thinning. One large flake
has been detached using the break as a platform.
Provenience: NI00.35/W96.12, elevation 100.63, colluvium.

Specimen H (Fig. 5) is a roughly oval biface of gray chert, poorly thinned
with heavy percussion flaking. A small patch of cortex on one side suggests
that it may have been made from a tabular stream cobble.
Provenience: N 100.85/W98.50, elevation 100.67, colluvium.
Specimen I (Fig. 5) is an elongate oval biface of gray-brown chert, somewhat
better percussion thinned than previous examples; itnas an oblique transverse
snap across one end with subsequent attempts on one face to use it as a
striking platform, and burin-like facet and additional battering on an adjacent
edge, indicating some effort to salvage the artifact after it was presumably
snapped during thinning.
Provenience: N100.60/W98.69, midlevel 1, colluvium.
Specimen J (Fig. 5) is a small bifacially chipped fragment of brown chert.
Provenience: N101.74/W94.l3, Levell, colluvium.
In addition to these items there is a small fragment of what appears to be
the end of a biface preform (NlOO/W92· NE quadrant, Level 2) and a small
oval biface preform with cortex on one face (Fig. 5; general surface).
Core
A small gray chert core (Fig. 5) has two striking platforms; one is a
naturally flat cortex-covered surface; the other is formed by two intersecting
core facets. The longest f1ake scar is about 4.5 cm.
Provenience: general surface.
Chipping Debris
From the excavations 96 flakes, 78 flake fragments (eg. lacking bulbs of
percussion; medial or distal fragments) and 26 angular fragments of chert
were recovered. The debris assemblage overwhelmingly represents manufacturing
waste from the final stages of thinning bifaces. Support for this inference
can be drawn from the small size and thinness of most of the flakes (Figs. 6,7),
the infrequency of cortex (Table 1), and the large proportion of flakes-nearly
a third-with groun~latform remnants. Mean length of complete flakes is
17.89 mm., mean~width l6.59mm., mean thickness 3.30 mm. All the dis­
tributions are skewed leftward. The mean dimensions for flakes with ground
platform remnants are smaller (length, 16.08 mm.; width, 14.08 mm.; thickness,
2.38 mm.) than those for the assemblage as a whole, indicating edge grinding
was a kind of platform preparation usually reserved for the final stages of
thinning. Flakes with ground platforms frequently are medially snapped, probably
because of thinness of the flakes.
Most of the chert is white, cream-colored, yellowish-buff, or light gray.
There is little evidence of heat treatment, and only two or three items show

thermal spalling or crazing. Several flakes appear under magnification to have
a slightly silty or argillaceous composition that may prove to be geologically
traceable.
Expedient Tools: Edge-Damaged Flakes
Nearly all the flakes and flake fragments show some evidence of edge
damage, ranging from random nicking, shallow bifacial retouch, or lateral
snapping to patterned, abrupt, unifacial retouch. Edge damage can result
from a variety of causes ranging from foot traffic to bag retouch. Microscopic
abrupt, patterned, unifacial retouch on a flake (utilized flake) usually indicates
use of the flake as an expedient tool for scraping some hard substance.
Nicking and other kinds of damage may indicate use of the edge for cutting,
but the relationship between type of use and type of damage is ambiguous.
Therefore only patterned unifacial retouch was tabulated for the chipping
debris; 10 flakes and 9 flake fragments, about 11 % of the debris, show this
kind of damage. Location of edge damage appears to be a function of the
shape of both the working edge and the complete flake. Provenience data
do not suggest concentration of edge-damaged flakes anywhere in the
excavations.
