ABSTRACT

This report documents the initial investigations at the three proposed bridge replacement
projects located on three off-system bridges: CR 324 at Linnville Bayou, CR 520 at a
drainage ditch, and CR 721-G at an engineered canal. All bridge replacement areas exist
in potential archeologically sensitive loci as indicated by the Houston Potential
Archeological Liability Map (PALM) (Abbott 2001). The survey, conducted by
personnel from Michael Baker, Jr., Inc. (Baker) under contract with the TxDOT, was part
of Categorical Exclusion documentation.
High Probability Areas (HPAs) encompass nearly 1.34 ac (0.54 ha) at the CR 324
crossing, 0.5 ac (0.18 ha) at the C.R. 520 crossing, and 0.28 ac (0.11 ha) at the CR 721-G
crossing. Both CR 324 and CR 520 are within PALM Map Unit 3, while CR 721-G is
designated as PALM Map Unit 1.
On November 22, 2006 a qualified Baker personnel conducted three separate
reconnaissance surveys, two at the two separate bridge sites in Brazoria County and one
that spanned Brazoria and Matagorda Counties. On December 5, 2006 Baker personnel
excavated 2 shovel tests and 4 auger probes at CR 324. Four auger probes were excavated
at CR 520 and CR 721-G on December 6, 2006.
As a result of this initial survey no cultural resources were encountered on or below the
ground surface. It is therefore highly unlikely that the remains of archeological cultural
resources exit within the conceptual design boundaries of the Proposed Action areas. It is
recommended that no further archeological investigation is required, and TxDOT may
proceed with the proposed projects. However, if any unknown cultural resources or
human remains are discovered during future project implementations within the current
boundaries, the cultural and/or human remains should be protected from further impacts.
All work in the vicinity of the remains should cease, and the TxDOT Houston District
and the TxDOT Environmental Division should be notified immediately, as per standing
agreements.

REPORT 1: MANAGEMENT SUMMARY CR 324 at LINNVILLE BAYOU
Project Title: Bridge Group 6: Archeological Reconnaissance Survey of CR 324 at
Linnville Bayou, Brazoria and Matagorda Counties, Texas.
Baker Project Number: 109082
Project Description: The documented task consisted of the effect of the proposed project
on cultural resources for the Build Alternative. The land on which this survey was
completed is publicly owned, and all existing ROW is controlled by TxDOT. The current
bridge, built in 1962, is a two-lane, nine-span timber bridge approximately 6.4 m (21 ft)
wide by 47 m (154 ft) long on timber piling with a concrete deck and curbs. There are
non-standard timber rails on the bridge. The existing facility is a rural gravel roadway.
The approach roadway width varies between approximately 5.5 and 6.4 m (18 and 21 ft).
The existing right-of-way (ROW) is approximately 24.4 m (80 ft) wide on the east side of
the project and 42.6 m (140 ft) on the west side. The existing ROW at the bridge structure
is approximately 32 m (105 ft) wide. The area of potential effect (APE) equals
approximately 1.34 ac (0.54 ha). However, the area considered to be the least disturbed
and most likely to be affected by the proposed impacts is approximately 0.18 ac (0.073
ha).
All provisions, methods, analyses, interpretation, curation and documentation needed to
conduct an archeological survey program of one Build Alternative were implemented by
Baker cultural resource personnel. This included background research and archival
investigation, a reconnaissance survey, shovel testing and deep auger probes where
deemed necessary, and the preparation and submission of a technical report.
Location: The proposed study area (PSA), CR 324 at Linnville Bayou, is located on the
Ashwood 7.5’ Quadrangle map (United States Geological Survey [USGS] 1980). In order
to access the PSA, travel east from Bayside, Texas on SH 35 for approximately 10.5 km
(6.54 mi). Turn south on Hasima Rd. and travel approximately 3.4 km (2.1 mi) to the
intersection of CR 324 and Linnville Bayou. UTM coordinates Zone 15, E229105
N3215765 (NAD 27 CONUS) were taken near the center of the bridge crossing.
TxDOT CSJ Number: 0912-31-151
Number of Surveyed Acres: Approximately 0.18 ac (0.073 ha).
Principal Investigator: Ruth A. Mathews
Dates Work Preformed: November 22, 2006 and December 5, 2006.
Purpose of Work: The proposed bridge and approach construction action evaluated two
alternative proposals, Build or No-Build, as described by the State. The documented task
consisted of the effect of the proposed project on cultural resources for the Build
Alternative. The proposed work would replace the existing bridge spanning Linnville

1

Bayou and improve pavement approaches. The existing timber bridge will be replaced
with a proposed 57.9 m (190 ft) long, 10.7 m (35 ft) wide concrete bridge structure.
All cultural resource work conformed to and exceeded the Archeological Survey
Standards as established by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) in consultation with
the Council of Texas Archeologists and Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Historical
Commission 2003). Identification followed standards in 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.5
(35), 13 TAC 26.20(1), and 13 TAC 26.20(2). The Texas standards are in accordance to
the instructions and intents set forth in Section 101(b)(4) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969; Section 1(3) and 2(b) of Executive Order 11593; 36 CFR Part 800,
Protection of Historic Properties, regulations implementing Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act, (16 U.S.C. 470f), as amended; 36 CFR Part 63; Archaeology
and Historic Preservation, and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines
(Federal Register 48[190] 44716-44742).
Number of Sites: None
Curation: Following document review and acceptance by TxDOT and the THC for
Section 106 review, all original field forms, photographs, and data will be compiled for
this Proposed Project and submitted to the TxDOT Houston District as part of their
project files.
Comments: As a result of this initial survey, it is highly unlikely that the remains of
archeological cultural resources exist within the conceptual design boundaries of the
Proposed Action area. It is recommended that no further archeological investigation is
required, and TxDOT may proceed with the proposed project. However, in the event that
unknown cultural resources or human remains are discovered during future project
implementations within the current boundaries, the cultural and/or human remains should
be protected from further impacts. All work in the vicinity of the remains should cease,
and the TxDOT Houston District and the TxDOT Environmental Division should be
notified immediately, as per standing agreements.

INTRODUCTION
The report provides the documentation of a cultural resource investigation conducted by
Michael Baker Jr. Inc. (Baker) cultural resource specialists for the Houston District,
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), Environmental Division; CSJ # 0912-31151. TxDOT contracted with Baker to assess the effects of deep impacts on potential
cultural resources within the existing right-of-way (ROW) at the Linnville Bayou Bridge,
and approach replacement project in Matagorda and Brazoria Counties, Texas.
The proposed study area (PSA), CR 324 at Linnville Bayou, is located on the Ashwood
7.5’ Quadrangle map (United States Geological Survey [USGS] 1980) (Figure 1). In
order to access the PSA, travel east from Bayside, Texas on SH 35 for approximately
10.5 km (6.54 mi). Turn south on Hasima Rd. and travel approximately 3.4 km (2.1 mi)
to the intersection of CR 324 and Linnville Bayou. UTM coordinates Zone 15, E229105
N3215765 (NAD 27 CONUS) were taken near the center of the bridge crossing.
All provisions, methods, analyses, interpretation, curation and documentation needed to
conduct an archeological survey program of one Build Alternative were implemented by
Baker personnel. This included background research and archival investigation, a
reconnaissance survey, shovel testing and/or deep auger probes where deemed necessary,
and the preparation and submission of a technical report. Ruth A. Mathews served as
Principal Investigator and Field Supervisor. On November 22, 2006 Mathews traveled to
the PSA, visually inspected the ground surface and cutbanks, and drove four stakes,
marked them, and called 1-800-DIG TESS. On December 5, William Cody conducted the
fieldwork.
The bridge replacement area was investigated by a reconnaissance survey with shovel
testing and deep reconnaissance on all four sides of the bridge. All work conformed to
and exceeded the Archeological Survey Standards as established by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) in consultation with the Council of Texas Archeologists and
Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Historical Commission 2003). Identification followed
standards in 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.5 (35), 13 TAC 26.20(1), and 13 TAC
26.20(2). The Texas standards are in accordance to the instructions and intents set forth in
Section 101(b)(4) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; Section 1(3) and
2(b) of Executive Order 11593; 36 CFR Part 800, Protection of Historic Properties,
regulations implementing Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, (16
U.S.C. 470f), as amended; 36 CFR Part 63; Archaeology and Historic Preservation, and
the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (Federal Register 48[190]
44716-44742).
Definition of the Project Study Area
The proposed PSA lies in Matagorda County on the north and west side of Linnville
Bayou and in Brazoria County on the south and east side of Linnville Bayou, at the
intersection of CR 324 and Linnville Bayou. The documented task consisted of the effect
of the proposed project on cultural resources for the Build Alternative. The land on which
this survey was completed is publicly owned, and all existing ROW is controlled by

3

TxDOT. The limits of the proposed project, and this environmental documentation,
encompass the area within the existing ROW. The total length of the project is
approximately 70.1 m (230 ft). The proposed bridge would be an approximate 9.2 m
(30.25 ft) wide by 57.9 m (190 ft) long four-span pre-stressed concrete slab beam unit
supported on concrete pilings. The bridge structure and approach roadway would consist
of two 3 m (10 ft) wide lanes (northbound and southbound) and 1.2 m (4 ft) wide
shoulders. The APE is approximately 1.34 ac (0.54 ha). However, the area considered to
be the least disturbed and most likely to be affected by the proposed impacts is
approximately 0.18 ac (0.073 ha). Even though the PSA is located in a heavily disturbed
alluvial setting, the Houston Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) indicates
that the PSA exists in Map Unit 3 (Figure 3) (Abbott 2001). Deep testing is
recommended in this area. While there is no PALM for Matagorda County, that portion
of the PSA located in Matagorda County is considered to be within the same defining
geographic and geological confines as the Brazoria County PALM Map Unit 3.
Brazoria and Matagorda Counties are located in the southeastern part of Texas
(Crenwelge et al 1981:1; Hyde 1991:7) in the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province
(Story 1990:2, 6). The area of CR 324 at Linnville Bayou is within the Coastal Prairie
subdivision of the Gulf Coastal Plain, and is further subdivided into the Blackland
Prairies portion of the Gulf Coastal Plains. The coastal plain was formed during the
Pleistocene Epoch when rising and falling sea levels created the Beaumont Formation, a
band of alluvial deltaic soils composed of clay with minor amounts of silt and sand
(Howard et al. 1992:3; Mangum and Moore 2002; Spearing 2002:35). Rising and falling
sea level created conditions conducive to multiple river meanders across a broad belt of
recent undifferentiated sands, muds, and clays (Gadus 1999), leaving behind an
abundance of oxbow lakes, natural levees, bayous, and point bars (Meyers 1998). Very
few lithic resources are available in the Beaumont Formation (Howard et al. 1992:3).
Linnville Bayou, a tributary of Caney Creek, begins in southeastern Wharton County and
runs approximately 56.3 km (35 mi) southeast before empting into Caney Creek near the
junction of Farm roads 521 and 457 in Matagorda County. The bayou crosses a flat
terrain pocked with shallow depression. Conifers and water tolerant deciduous trees and
grasses grow along the banks in clay and sandy loams.
Soils in the vicinity of CR 324 and Linnville Bayou, consists of the Pledger-Brazoria Soil
Association (Crenwelge et al. 1981:81, 92). Pledger clay, formed from recent fluvial
deposits, dominates the terrain. Pledger soils, formed primarily as bottomlands, are nearly
level, non-saline black (5YR2/1) clay down to approximately 66 cm (26 in) below the
modern ground surface. These moderately alkaline soils are somewhat poorly drained,
very slowly permeable, blocky and very hard. Below this, down to roughly 127 cm (50
in), the soil changes to a reddish brown (5YR4/3 to 5YR5/3) silty clay that is moderately
blocky, very hard and contains a minimal amount of calcium carbonate concretions. From
127 cm (50 in) to 162 cm (64 in) the soil remains reddish brown, but is very hard, dry,
massive, and moderately alkaline, with increasing amounts of calcium carbonate
concretions.

The PSA is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950), and are
situated in Coastal Prairie and Marsh vegetation regions, and has a humid, subtropical
climate (Story et al. 1990). Prior to the development of the oil field and agriculture, the
natural environment consisted solely of wetland and forested habitats. Modern vegetation
in the vicinity consists of a diverse assemblage of primarily deciduous trees,
undergrowth, and grasses. Terrestrial mammals common to the area include deer,
squirrels, raccoons, opossum, rabbits, skunks, and gophers. Wetland animal species
include freshwater mussels and snails, many different species of fish, alligators,
salamanders, turtles, and snakes (Abbott 2001).
Cultural resource investigations, which began on November 22, revealed that the PSA is
situated in a heavily disturbed alluvial setting. Some of the numerous earlier cultural and
natural impacts include the construction of the original bridge and CR 324, the
maintenance of these structures, and erosion from sheet wash and flooding. The area is a
mix of agricultural lands and oil field activity. Today cattle graze the area and use the
bayou as a source of water. A makeshift dam has been created across the bayou east of
the bridge, allowing occasional flooding in the PSA vicinity. The road bed on the
Matagorda County side of the bayou has been elevated significantly, and minimally
elevated on the Brazoria County side. Despite these impacts to the area it was decided to
excavate two shovel tests down to one meter and use an auger to probe to go further
down to the existing water table or to a depth of 3 m (9.8 ft). This decision was the result
of insufficient geomorphic data for the area and the Houston PALM.

METHODS
Background Review
The methods of investigation, carried out by Baker cultural resource personnel, consisted
of an in depth background research and archival investigation. Background research was
conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Prehistoric and Historic Site’s Atlas, The Handbook of Texas
History online, and the online National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listing. Aerial
photographs, historic maps, geologic maps, and soil survey maps were examined through
the Texas General Land Office, TerraServer USA (2005), Bureau of Economic Geology,
and Soil Conservation Survey (Crenwelge 1981, Hyde 1991).
Field Methods
The reconnaissance survey consisted of a visual inspection of all exposed areas including
the ground surface and cutbanks within the existing ROW of the proposed project area.
Even though the PSA is located in a heavily disturbed alluvial setting, the Houston
PALM recommends deep testing in this area. It was decided to deep test the area to
acquire comparative geomorphic data and to satisfy the recommendations of the Houston
District PALM for Map Unit 3. A total of two shovel tests and four auger probes were
excavated. One shovel test was placed at the NW and SE corner of the bridge and
excavated down to 1 m (3.28 ft) (Figure 4). A 7.6 cm (3 in) bore auger probe was begun
at the bottom of each shovel test and taken to the existing water table. Two more auger
probes were placed at the NE and SW corners and were excavated from the ground
surface to the existing water table.
RESULTS
Background Review
Archival Research in the vicinity of CR 324 at the Linnville Bayou has shown that the
area was originally part of “Chance’s Prairie” (Kleiner 2001). Joseph H. Polley and
Samuel Chance were granted a parcel of land in 1824 from the Mexican Government.
The William Sweeny household, one of the earliest settlers in the area, arrived in 1832.
Sweeny, Sr., developed a large cotton plantation. Six of the eight Sweeny children
developed adjoining plantations in the area by 1854. James Abercrombie discovered oil
near the Linnville crossing in 1934 (Kliener 2001). Today a large refinery, pumps, and oil
field roads are located in the area. Background information obtained from the THC
archeological sites atlas has revealed that there have been no archeological investigations
within one mile of the proposed project area. It also revealed that archeological
investigations further than one mile had not recovered any cultural resources. Information
obtained from soil surveys and geological maps indicate that the area has a relatively
young geological history, and geomorphic studies in the coastal plain area have indicated
that the land form is relatively unstable, thereby making the discovery of intact
archeological remains difficult.

Field Survey
On November 22, 2006, Ruth Mathews, from the Austin Baker office located the PSA
and examined cut banks and other exposed areas for cultural resources. No cultural
resources were located in exposed cutbanks, nor were any located on ground surfaces.
The entire PSA is situated in a heavily disturbed alluvial setting, with an overall ground
surface visibility that ranged between zero and 100 percent. Despite the lack of artifacts
and the degree of cultural and natural impacts, excavation of the area was determined
necessary. The Houston-PALM identifies the area as a Map Unit 3, and suggests cultural
resources in that area could be deeply buried. There is also a deficiency of comparative
geomorphic data for the Linnville Bayou area.

10

Subsurface testing began at the site on December 5, 2006 by William Cody, also of the
Austin Baker office. Two shovel tests (ST), one placed at the NW corner of the bridge
and two, located at the SE corner of the bridge, were excavated to 1 m (3.28 ft) below the
modern ground surface. One auger probe (AP 1), placed at the bottom of ST 1, was taken
down an additional 90 cm (35.4 in) for a total of 190 cm (74.8 in). The auger probe (AP
4) in ST 2 was dug down an additional 140 cm (55.12 in) for a total of 240 cm (94.5 in).
Auger probe (AP) 3, located at the SW corner of the bridge, was excavated down to 160
cm (62.9 in). The final auger probe, AP 2, placed at the NE corner, was excavated to a
depth of 180 cm (70.9 in). These soils are consistent with the Matagorda and Brazoria
Soils Survey definitions (Crenwdge et al. 1981, Hyde 1991). All APs terminated at the
present water table. No cultural resources were recovered.
Clay soils were not screened. In order to maximize artifact recovery, excessively wet or
clayey soils were carefully divided with a hand trowel. The location and depth, soil
texture, structure, and color were recorded for each shovel test. Soil color was described
using the Munsell Color chart. One ST and AP were profiled (Figures 5). There were no
prehistoric or historic artifacts or features discovered in any of the shovel tests. All shovel
tests were back-filled upon completion of the archeological recordation process.
Soil Stratigraphy:
Field designation F3, first identified in ST 1-AP 1, between 0 and 60 cmbs (27.6 in), was
recorded as mix of duff, rubble from bridge and highway construction, and floods.
Field designation F4, first identified in ST 1, between 60 and 170 cmbs (67 in), was
recorded as reddish brown, 5YR4/3 hard packed silty clay.
Field designation F5, first identified in ST 1-AP 1, between 170 and 190 cmbs (74.8 in),
was recorded as a yellowish red, 5YR4/6 hard packed clay.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Austin Baker Cultural Resource department conducted an archeological
reconnaissance survey of approximately 0.18 ac (0.073 ha) of Houston District – HPAs,
Unit 3 at the intersection of CR 324 and Linnville Bayou in Matagorda and Brazoria
Counties. The survey was conducted for the TxDOT Houston ENV office in order to
assess the effects of deep impacts on potential cultural resources within the existing rightof-way (ROW) for a pending bridge and approach replacement project. The archeological
investigation included a background review and a reconnaissance survey augmented by
shovel tests and deep auger probes.
The reconnaissance survey consisted of a systematic surface inspection of areas that
offered ground surface visibility and exposed cutbanks. The bridge structure, concrete,
asphalt, gravel, garbage, duff, grasses, forbs, vines, and palmettos obscured most of the
ground surface. Area with good visibility included, cutbanks, places where pasture
animals had trampled the ground, and the space below the bridge, where no vegetation
grows. A total of four subsurface probes were excavated at the site; one at each corner of
the bridge. Two shovel tests were excavated to 1 m (3.28 ft) below the surface and
profiled. An auger probe was placed in the bottom of each shovel test and two more
auger probes were excavated on opposite bridge corners. The average overall depth was
217 cmbs (85.4 in). All probes were terminated at the current water table.
As a result of this survey, no previously unknown archeological cultural resources were
identified within the conceptual design boundaries of the proposed project, and no buried
cultural materials or buried living surfaces were identified. It is recommended that no
further intensive archeological survey is required, and TxDOT may proceed with the
proposed project. However, if any unknown cultural resources or human remains are
discovered during future project implementations within the current boundary, the
cultural and/or human remains should be protected from further impacts. All work in the
vicinity of the remains should cease, and the TxDOT Houston District and the TxDOT
Environmental Division should be notified immediately, as per standing agreements.

REPORT 2: MANAGEMENT SUMMARY CR 520 at A DRAINAGE DITCH
Project Title: Bridge Group 6: Archeological Reconnaissance Survey for CR 520 at a
Drainage Ditch, Brazoria County, Texas.
Baker Project Number: 109082
Project Description: The reconnaissance survey, conducted by personnel from Michael
Baker, Jr., Inc. (Baker) under contract with the TxDOT, was part of Categorical
Exclusion Documentation. The documented task consisted of the effect of the proposed
project on cultural resources for the Build Alternative. The land on which this survey was
completed is publicly owned, and all existing ROW is controlled by TxDOT. The
purpose of the proposed action is to improve or replace the existing two-barrel culvert
and pavement approaches. The current bridge, built in 1961, is an undivided, two-lane
asphalt bridge that is approximately 7 m (23 ft) wide and spans two concrete box
culverts. The approach roadway width is approximately 6.1 m (20 ft) wide. The double
barrel culvert crossing will be replaced with a proposed 15.2 m (50 ft) long, 10.7 m (35
ft) wide concrete bridge structure. The area of potential effect (APE) for the 27.4 m (90
ft) long project is the existing 30.5 m (100 ft) ROW, which equals to approximately 0.5
ac (0.18 ha). However, the area considered to be the least disturbed and most likely to be
affected by the proposed impacts is approximately 0.1 ac (0.04 ha).
All provisions, methods, analyses, interpretation, curation and documentation needed to
conduct an archeological survey program of one Build Alternative were implemented by
Baker cultural resource personnel. This included background research and archival
investigation, a reconnaissance survey, four deep auger probes, and the preparation and
submission of a technical report.
Location: The proposed study area (PSA), CR 520 at a drainage ditch, is located on the
Brazoria 7.5’ Quadrangle map (United States Geological Survey [USGS] 1972). In order
to access the PSA, travel southwest from the intersection of SH 36 and FM 521 in
Brazoria, Texas for approximately 2.8 km (1.76 mi) to the intersection of FM 521 and CR
520. Turn south on FM 520 and travel approximately 0.6 km (0.37 mi) to the intersection
of CR 520 and a drainage ditch. UTM coordinates Zone 15, E248341 N3211767 (NAD
27 CONUS) were taken near the center of the double culvert crossing.
TxDOT CSJ Number: 0912-31-132
Number of Surveyed Acres: Approximately 0.1 ac (0.04 ha).
Principal Investigator: Ruth A. Mathews
Dates Work Preformed: November 22, 2006 and December 5, 2006.
Purpose of Work: The proposed bridge and approach construction action evaluated two
alternative proposals, Build or No-Build, as described by the State. The documented task

16

consisted of the effect of the proposed project on cultural resources for the Build
Alternative. The purpose of the proposed action is to improve or replace the outdated
double culvert and pavement approaches. All work conformed to and exceeded the
Archeological Survey Standards as established by the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) in consultation with the Council of Texas Archeologists and Antiquities Code of
Texas (Texas Historical Commission 2003). Identification followed standards in 13 TAC
26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.5 (35), 13 TAC 26.20(1), and 13 TAC 26.20(2). The Texas
standards are in accordance to the instructions and intents set forth in Section 101(b)(4)
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; Section 1(3) and 2(b) of Executive
Order 11593; 36 CFR Part 800, Protection of Historic Properties, regulations
implementing Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, (16 U.S.C. 470f), as
amended; 36 CFR Part 63; Archaeology and Historic Preservation, and the Secretary of
the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (Federal Register 48[190] 44716-44742).
Number of Sites: None
Curation: Following document review and acceptance by TxDOT and the THC for
Section 106 review, all original field forms, photographs, and data will be compiled for
this Proposed Project and submitted to the TxDOT Houston District as part of their
project files.
Comments: As a result of this initial survey, it is highly unlikely that the remains of
archeological cultural resources exit within the conceptual design boundaries of the
Proposed Action area. It is recommended that no further archeological investigation is
required, and TxDOT may proceed with the proposed project. However, in the event that
unknown cultural resources or human remains are discovered during future project
implementations within the current boundaries, the cultural and/or human remains should
be protected from further impacts. All work in the vicinity of the remains should cease,
and the TxDOT Houston District and the TxDOT Environmental Division should be
notified immediately, as per standing agreements.

INTRODUCTION
The report provides the documentation of a cultural resource investigation conducted by
Michael Baker Jr. Inc. (Baker) cultural resource specialists for the Houston District,
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), Environmental Division; CSJ # 0912-31132. TxDOT contracted with Baker to assess the effects of deep impacts on potential
cultural resources within the existing right-of-way (ROW) at the CR 520 drainage ditch
crossing and approach replacement project in Brazoria County, Texas as part of a
Categorical Exclusion Documentation.
The proposed study area (PSA), CR 520 at a drainage ditch, is located on the Brazoria
7.5’ Quadrangle map (United States Geological Survey [USGS] 1972) (Figure 1). In
order to access the PSA, travel east from Bayside, Texas on SH 35 for approximately
10.5 km (6.54 mi). Turn south on Hasima Rd. and travel approximately 3.4 km (2.1 mi)
to the intersection of CR 324 and Linnville Bayou. UTM coordinates Zone 15, E229105
N3215765 (NAD 27 CONUS) were taken near the center of the crossing.
All provisions, methods, analyses, interpretation, curation and documentation needed to
conduct an archeological survey program of one Build Alternative were implemented by
Baker personnel. This included background research and archival investigation, a
reconnaissance survey, deep auger probes, and the preparation and submission of a
technical report. Ruth A. Mathews served as Principal Investigator and Field Supervisor.
On November 22, 2006 Mathews traveled to the PSA, visually inspected the ground
surface and cutbanks, drove four stakes, marked them, and called 1-800-DIG TESS. On
December 5, William Cody conducted the fieldwork.
The two-barrel culvert replacement area was investigated by a reconnaissance survey
augmented with deep auger probes on all four sides of the crossing. All work conformed
to and exceeded the Archeological Survey Standards as established by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) in consultation with the Council of Texas Archeologists
and Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Historical Commission 2003). Identification
followed standards in 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.5 (35), 13 TAC 26.20(1), and 13
TAC 26.20(2). The Texas standards are in accordance to the instructions and intents set
forth in Section 101(b)(4) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; Section
1(3) and 2(b) of Executive Order 11593; 36 CFR Part 800, Protection of Historic
Properties, regulations implementing Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act, (16 U.S.C. 470f), as amended; 36 CFR Part 63; Archaeology and Historic
Preservation, and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (Federal
Register 48[190] 44716-44742).
Definition of the Project Study Area
The proposed PSA lies in Brazoria County, southeast of Brazoria, Texas at the
intersection of CR 520 and a drainage ditch. The documented task consisted of the effect
of the proposed project on cultural resources for the Build Alternative. The land on which
this survey was completed is publicly owned, and all existing ROW is controlled by
TxDOT. The purpose of the proposed action is to improve or replace the existing two-

18

barrel culvert and pavement approaches. The double barrel culvert crossing will be
replaced with a proposed 15.2 m (50 ft) long, 9.2 m (30.25 ft) wide single-span prestressed concrete slab beam unit supported on concrete pilings. The bridge structure and
approach roadway would consist of two 3.3 m (11 ft) wide lanes (eastbound and
westbound) and 1.2 m (4 ft) wide shoulders. The planned construction area is a 27.4 m
(90 ft) long strip of road within the existing 30.5 m (100 ft) ROW, or approximately 0.5
ac (0.18 ha) (Figure 2). However, the portion of the PSA considered to be the least
disturbed and most likely to be affected by the proposed impacts is approximately 0.1 ac
(0.04 ha). Even though the PSA is located in a heavily disturbed alluvial setting, the
Houston Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) indicates that the PSA exists in
Map Unit 3 (Figure 3) (Abbott 2001). Deep testing is recommended in this area.
Brazoria County is located in the southeastern part of Texas (Crenwelge et al 1981:1) in
the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province (Story 1990:2, 6). The area of CR 520 at
the ditch near the San Bernard River is within the Coastal Prairie subdivision of the Gulf
Coastal Plain, and is further subdivided into the Blackland Prairies portion of the Gulf
Coastal Plains. The coastal plain was formed during the Pleistocene Epoch when rising
and falling sea levels created the Beaumont Formation, a band of alluvial deltaic soils
composed of clay with minor amounts of silt and sand (Howard et al. 1992:3; Mangum
and Moore 2002; Spearing 2002:35). Rising and falling sea level created conditions
conducive to multiple river meanders across a broad belt of recent undifferentiated sands,
muds, and clays (Gadus 1999), leaving behind an abundance of oxbow lakes, natural
levees, bayous, and point bars (Meyers 1998). Very few lithic resources are available in
the Beaumont Formation (Howard et al. 1992:3).
County Road 520 and the ditch it crosses over are situated within the San Bernard
watershed. The San Bernard River begins in southwestern Austin County. It flows
southeast for approximately 194.4 km (120 mi) and enters the Gulf of Mexico
Intracoastal Canal northeast of Cedar Lake. Primary tributaries of the San Bernard River
include the East, West and Middle Bernard creeks, the Little San Bernard River, Peach,
Mound, Coushatta, and Bell creeks, and McNeal and Redfish bayous. The San Bernard
and its tributaries are all used for irrigation.
Soils in the vicinity of CR 520 and the drainage ditch, consists of the Pledger-Brazoria
Soil Association (Crenwelge et al. 1981:81, 92). Pledger clay, formed from recent fluvial
deposits, dominates the terrain. Pledger soils, formed primarily as bottomlands, are nearly
level, non-saline black (5YR2/1) clay down to approximately 66 cm (26 in) below the
modern ground surface. These moderately alkaline soils are somewhat poorly drained,
very slowly permeable, blocky and very hard. Below this, down to roughly 127 cm (50
in), the soil changes to a reddish brown (5YR4/3 to 5YR5/3) silty clay that is moderately
blocky, very hard and contains a minimal amount of calcium carbonate concretions. From
127 cm (50 in) to 162 cm (64 in) the soil remains reddish brown, but is very hard, dry,
massive, and moderately alkaline, with increasing amounts of calcium carbonate
concretions.

19

The PSA is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950), and is situated
in Coastal Prairie and Marsh vegetation regions, with a humid, subtropical climate (Story
et al. 1990). Prior to the development of the urban and agricultural elements, the natural
environment consisted solely of wetland and forested habitats. Modern vegetation in the
vicinity consists of a diverse assemblage of primarily deciduous trees, undergrowth, and
grasses. Terrestrial mammals common to the area include deer, squirrels, raccoons,
opossum, rabbits, skunks, and gophers. Wetland animal species include freshwater
mussels and snails, many different species of fish, alligators, salamanders, turtles, and
snakes (Abbott 2001).
Cultural resource investigations, which began on November 22, revealed that the PSA is
situated in a heavily disturbed alluvial setting. Some of the numerous earlier cultural and
natural impacts include the installation of the culverts, the construction of CR 520, the
maintenance of these structures, the installation of buried fiber optics, and erosion from
flooding events. The PSA is situated in a semi-urban environment and is a mix of
agricultural lands and residential structures. The road has been artificially elevated.
Despite these impacts to the area it was decided to excavate four auger probes at each
corner of the double culvert. All probes were taken down to the existing water table or to
a depth of 3 m (9.8 ft).

METHODS
Background Review
The methods of investigation, carried out by Baker cultural resource personnel, consisted
of an in depth background research and archival investigation. Background research was
conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Prehistoric and Historic Site’s Atlas, The Handbook of Texas
History online, and the online National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listing. Aerial
photographs, historic maps, geologic maps, and soil survey maps were examined through
the Texas General Land Office, TerraServer USA (2005), Bureau of Economic Geology,
and Soil Conservation Survey (Crenwelge 1981).
Field Methods
The reconnaissance survey consisted of a visual inspection of all exposed areas including
the ground surface and gopher holes within the existing ROW of the proposed project
area. Even though the PSA is located in a heavily disturbed alluvial setting, the Houston
PALM recommends deep testing in this area. It was decided to deep test in order to
satisfy the recommendations of the Houston District PALM for Map Unit 3. A total of
four 7.6 cm (3 in) diameter auger probes were excavated. Auger probes were placed at
the NE, NW, SE and SW corners of the culverts, and excavated in 20 cm (7.9 in)
arbitrary levels from the ground surface to the existing water table. All soil was cut
through with a trowel instead of screened due to the consistency of the clay soil.
RESULTS
Background Review
Investigations at the above named archival facilities indicated that there has been a single
survey undertaking and two documented archeological sites within one mile of the CR
520 drainage ditch near the San Bernard River. Archeological site, 41BO100, originally
recorded in 1974 as Vicker’s Site #1, is documented as a Rangia shell midden (THC
2005). The site was exposed in a cutbank of the San Bernard River. It is approximately 3
m (9.8 ft) above the then current river flow, 40 cm (15.7 in) thick and 50 cm (19.7 in)
below the surface. Soil matrix above the midden is a yellowish red sandy loam with very
little clay. The soil associated with the upper portion of the midden is a darker and more
brownish red with increased clay content. Only shell and charcoal were documented in
the midden. No other cultural resources were noted. While the site extends along the east
bank of the San Bernard River for approximately 25 m (82 ft), it only extends back
approximately 1 m (3.28 ft) from the bank. The site has been severely eroded by the San
Bernard River, but the small portion of the remaining site is believed to contain some
integrity and was recommended for further testing (THC 2005).
In 1985 the Mims-Fannin Plantation, 41BO164, was documented less than 1km (0.62 mi)
west of the drainage ditch at CR 520 on the west bank of the San Bernard River near the
present Sportsman Span Bridge by members of the Brazosport Archeological Society
(Smith 1985). The plantation has been continuously occupied from 1834 to the present.
The original house burned in 1921, but was rebuilt. The plantation site also contains a

24

prehistoric shell midden component (Smith 1985). While the site is believed to be the
original dwelling of the Mims family and part of the larger plantation(s) enterprise, no
recommendations were made. Archeological investigations further than one mile had not
recovered any cultural resources. Information obtained from soil surveys and geological
maps indicate that the area has a relatively young geological history.
Field Survey
On November 22, 2006, Ruth Mathews, from the Austin Baker office located the PSA
and examined gopher holes and other exposed areas for cultural resources. No cultural
resources were located in exposed areas, nor were any located on the ground surface. The
entire PSA is situated in a heavily disturbed alluvial setting, with an overall ground
surface visibility that ranged between zero and 10 percent. Despite the lack of artifacts
and the degree of cultural and natural impacts, excavation of the area was determined
necessary. The decision to excavate is the result of the Houston District PALM criteria
for investigations in Map Unit 3, which states that there could be deeply buried cultural
resources in this area. Also, given that there are two prehistoric shell middens and the
historic Mims-Fannin Plantation within one mile of the PSA, there existed the potential
for the discovery of historic and/or prehistoric cultural remains.
Subsurface testing began at the site on December 5, 2006 by William Cody, also of the
Austin Baker office. Four auger probes (AP) were excavated at the site, with one AP at
each corner of the culvert crossing (Figure 4). Auger probe # 1, located east of the ditch
and north of the culvert, was excavated down to 220 cm (86.6 in). The second AP,
located east of the ditch and south of CR 520, was taken down to 190 cm (74.8 in) below
the present ground surface. Auger Probe # 3, located west of the ditch and north of CR
520 was excavated to a depth of 200 cm (78.7 in), and AP # 4, west of the ditch and south
of CR 520, was taken down to 175 cm (68.9 in). The soils recorded from each probe are
consistent with the Brazoria County Soils Survey definitions (Crenwdge et al. 1981). All
APs terminated at the present water table. No cultural resources were recovered.
Clay soils were not screened. In order to maximize artifact recovery, excessively wet and
clayey soils were carefully divided with a hand trowel. The location and depth, soil
texture, structure, and color were recorded for each shovel test. Soil color was described
using the Munsell Color chart. One AP was profiled (Figure 5). There were no prehistoric
or historic artifacts or features discovered in any of the auger probes. All probes were
back-filled upon completion of the archeological recordation process.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
As part of a Categorical Exclusion Documentation, the Austin Baker Cultural Resource
department conducted an archeological reconnaissance survey of approximately 0.1 ac
(0.04 ha) of Houston District – HPAs, Map Unit 3 at the intersection of CR 520 and a
drainage ditch in Brazoria County. The survey was conducted in order to assess the
effects of deep impacts on potential cultural resources within the existing right-of-way
(ROW) for a pending bridge and approach replacement project. The archeological
investigation included a background review and a reconnaissance survey augmented by
deep auger probes.
The reconnaissance survey consisted of a systematic surface inspection of areas that
offered ground surface visibility. The culverts, concrete, asphalt, gravel, garbage, duff,
grasses, forbs, vines, and palmettos obscured most of the ground surface. Areas with
good visibility included gopher holes and ant beds. A total of four subsurface probes
were excavated at the site; one at each corner of the bridge. One auger probe was
profiled. The average overall depth was 196 cmbs (77.2 in). All probes were terminated
at the current water table.
As a result of this survey, no previously unknown archeological cultural resources were
identified within the conceptual design boundaries of the proposed project, and no buried
cultural materials or buried living surfaces were identified. It is recommended that no
further intensive archeological survey is required, and TxDOT may proceed with the
proposed project. However, if any unknown cultural resources or human remains are
discovered during future project implementations within the current boundary, the
cultural and/or human remains should be protected from further impacts and all work in
the vicinity of the remains should cease, and the TxDOT Houston District and the
TxDOT Environmental Division should be notified immediately, as per standing
agreements.

REPORT 3: MANAGEMENT SUMMARY CR 721-G AT AN ENGINEERED
CANAL
Project Title: Bridge Group 6: Archeological Reconnaissance Survey for CR 721-G at
an Engineered Canal, Brazoria County, Texas.
Baker Project Number: 109082
Project Description: The reconnaissance survey, conducted by personnel from Michael
Baker, Jr., Inc. (Baker) under contract with the TxDOT, was part of Categorical
Exclusion Documentation. The documented task consisted of the effect of the proposed
project on cultural resources for the Build Alternative. The land on which this survey was
completed is publicly owned, and all existing ROW is controlled by TxDOT. The current
bridge, built in 1969, is a two-lane, three-span, timber bridge approximately 8.7 m (28.4
ft) wide by six, 2.4 m (8 ft) long on timber piling with a concrete deck and curbs. There
are non-standard steel rails on the bridge. The existing roadway is a rural asphalt roadway
with an open ditch. The bridge roadway width is approximately 7.4 m (24.3 ft) wide.
The area of potential effect (APE) for the 39.6 m (130 ft) long project is the existing 24.4
m (80 ft) ROW, which equals to approximately 0.28 ac (0.11 ha). However, the area
considered to be the least disturbed and most likely to be affected by the proposed
impacts is approximately 0.1 ac (0.04 ha). All provisions, methods, analyses,
interpretation, curation and documentation needed to conduct an archeological survey
program of one Build Alternative were implemented by Baker cultural resource
personnel. This included background research and archival investigation, a
reconnaissance survey, four deep auger probes, and the preparation and submission of a
technical report.
Location: The proposed study area (PSA), CR 721-G at an engineered canal, is located
on the Oyster Creek 7.5’ Quadrangle map (United States Geological Survey [USGS]

Purpose of Work: The proposed bridge and approach construction action evaluated two
alternative proposals, Build or No-Build, as described by the State. The documented task
consisted of the effect of the proposed project on cultural resources for the Build
Alternative. The purpose of the proposed action is to improve or replace the outdated
timber and concrete bridge and pavement approaches. The existing bridge will be
replaced with a proposed 27.4 m (90 ft) long, 10.7 m (35 ft) wide concrete bridge
structure. All work conformed to and exceeded the Archeological Survey Standards as
established by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) in consultation with the Council
of Texas Archeologists and Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Historical Commission
2003).
Number of Sites: None
Curation: Following document review and acceptance by TxDOT and the THC for
Section 106 review, all original field forms, photographs, and data will be compiled for
this Proposed Project and submitted to the TxDOT Houston District as part of their
project files.
Comments: As a result of this initial survey, it is highly unlikely that the remains of
archeological cultural resources exit within the conceptual design boundaries of the
Proposed Action area. It is recommended that no further archeological investigation is
required, and TxDOT may proceed with the proposed project. However, in the event that
unknown cultural resources or human remains are discovered during future project
implementations within the current boundaries, the cultural and/or human remains should
be protected from further impacts. All work in the vicinity of the remains should cease,
and the TxDOT Houston District and the TxDOT Environmental Division should be
notified immediately, as per standing agreements.

INTRODUCTION
The report provides the documentation of a cultural resource investigation conducted by
Michael Baker Jr. Inc. (Baker) cultural resource specialists for the Houston District,
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), Environmental Division; CSJ # 0912-31153. TxDOT contracted with Baker to assess the effects of deep impacts on potential
cultural resources within the existing right-of-way (ROW) at the CR 721-G bridge and
approach replacement project in Brazoria County, Texas as part of a Categorical
Exclusion Documentation.
The proposed study area (PSA), CR 721-G at an engineered canal, is located on the
Oyster Creek 7.5’ Quadrangle map (United States Geological Survey [USGS] 1974)
(Figure 1). It is situated in a rural residential setting that emphasizes bayside living and
boating activity. In order to access the PSA, travel north on FM 532 from the intersection
of SH 332 and FM 523 for approximately 4.7 km (2.9 mi) to the intersection of FM 523
and CR 792, located north of Oyster Creek. Turn east and travel approximately 3.2 km (2
mi) to CR 721-G. Continue going east for roughly 0.8 km (0.5 mi) to the bridge over the
engineered canal. UTM coordinates Zone 15, E275517 N3210615 (NAD 27 CONUS)
were taken near the center of the bridge crossing.
All provisions, methods, analyses, interpretation, curation and documentation needed to
conduct an archeological survey program of one Build Alternative were implemented by
Baker personnel. This included background research and archival investigation, a
reconnaissance survey augmented with deep auger probes, and the preparation and
submission of a technical report. Ruth A. Mathews served as Principal Investigator and
Field Supervisor. On November 22, 2006 Mathews traveled to the PSA, visually
inspected the ground surface and cutbanks, drove four stakes, marked them, and called 1800-DIG TESS. On December 6, William Cody conducted the fieldwork.
A reconnaissance survey augmented with deep auger probes on all four sides of the
crossing was conducted at the PSA. All work conformed to and exceeded the
Archeological Survey Standards as established by the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) in consultation with the Council of Texas Archeologists and Antiquities Code of
Texas (Texas Historical Commission 2003). Identification followed standards in 13 TAC
26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.5 (35), 13 TAC 26.20(1), and 13 TAC 26.20(2). The Texas
standards are in accordance to the instructions and intents set forth in Section 101(b)(4)
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; Section 1(3) and 2(b) of Executive
Order 11593; 36 CFR Part 800, Protection of Historic Properties, regulations
implementing Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, (16 U.S.C. 470f), as
amended; 36 CFR Part 63; Archaeology and Historic Preservation, and the Secretary of
the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (Federal Register 48[190] 44716-44742).
Definition of the Project Study Area
The proposed PSA lies in Brazoria County, southeast of Lake Jackson, Texas at the
intersection of CR 721-G and an engineered canal. The land on which this survey was
completed is publicly owned, and all existing ROW is controlled by TxDOT. The

33

documented task consisted of the effect of the proposed project on cultural resources for
the Build Alternative. The purpose of the proposed action is to replace the outdated
timber and concrete bridge and widen and secure pavement approaches. The proposed
bridge would be an approximate 9.2 m (30.25 ft) wide by 30.5 m (100 ft) long three-span
pre-stressed concrete slab beam unit supported on concrete pilings. The bridge structure
and approach roadway would consist of two 3.1 m (10 ft) wide lanes (eastbound and
westbound) and 1.2 m (4 ft) wide shoulders. The planned APE is a 39.6 m (130 ft) long
strip of road within the existing 18.3 m (60 ft) ROW, or approximately 0.28ac (0.11 ha)
(Figure 2). However, the portion of the APE considered to be the least disturbed and most
likely to be affected by the proposed impacts is approximately 0.1 ac (0.04 ha). Even
though the PSA is located in a heavily disturbed alluvial setting, the Houston Potential
Archeological Liability Map (PALM) indicates that the PSA exists in Map Unit 1 (Figure
3) (Abbott 2001). Surface survey and deep testing are recommended in this area.
Brazoria County is located in the southeastern part of Texas (Crenwelge et al 1981:1) in
the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province (Story 1990:2, 6). The coastal plain was
formed during the Pleistocene Epoch when rising and falling sea levels created the
Beaumont Formation, a band of alluvial deltaic soils composed of clay with minor
amounts of silt and sand (Howard et al. 1992:3; Mangum and Moore 2002; Spearing
2002:35). Rising and falling sea level created conditions conducive to multiple river
meanders across a broad belt of recent undifferentiated sands, muds, and clays (Gadus
1999), leaving behind an abundance of oxbow lakes, natural levees, bayous, and point
bars (Meyers 1998). Very few lithic resources are available in the Beaumont Formation
(Howard et al. 1992:3).
County Road 721-G and the canal are associated with the Oyster Creek watershed. Oyster
Creek, begins in north central Fort Bend County and flows southeast for approximately
83.7 km (52 mi) through Brazoria County and on into the Gulf of Mexico. The land
around Oyster Creek is extremely fertile and attracted many early Texas settlers to the
area.
Soils associated with the CR 721-G PA area, consists of the Surfside–Velasco Soil
Association (Crenwelge et al. 1981:96). Surfside clay, formed from recent fluvial
deposits, dominates the terrain at the eastern most PA area, and is usually found in and
around marshes. The surface layer is roughly 35.6 cm (14 in) thick and is a very dark
gray (10YR3/1) clay. It is blocky, very hard and firm, mildly alkaline and saline with
strong brown stains along old root channels. Below this level, down to approximately
81.3 cm (32 in), the soil color lightens slightly to a dark gray (10YR4/1), while other soil
characteristics remain the same (Crenwelge et al. 1981:35). The subsoil extends 183 cm
(72 in) below the second lens. It is a dark reddish brown clay that is moderately alkaline,
calcareous, and saline. Surfside soils are poorly drained and surface water is slow to run
off.
The PSA is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950), and is situated
in Coastal Prairie and Marsh vegetation regions, with a humid, subtropical climate (Story
et al. 1990). Prior to the development of the urban and agricultural elements, the natural

34

environment consisted solely of wetland and forested habitats. Modern vegetation in the
vicinity consists of a diverse assemblage of primarily deciduous trees, undergrowth, and
grasses. Terrestrial mammals common to the area include deer, squirrels, raccoons,
opossum, rabbits, skunks, and gophers. Wetland animal species include freshwater
mussels and snails, many different species of fish, alligators, salamanders, turtles, and
snakes (Abbott 2001).
Cultural resource investigations, which began on November 22, revealed that the PSA is
situated in a heavily disturbed alluvial setting. Some of the numerous earlier cultural and
natural impacts include the creation of the canal, the construction of the bridge and CR
721-G, the maintenance of these structures, the installation of wood pilings along the
edge of the canal, the addition of fill, and erosion from wave activity. The PSA is situated
in a rural urban environment and is a mix of boat canals, roads, and residential structures.
The approaches to the bridge have been artificially elevated. Despite these impacts to the
area it was decided to excavate four auger probes at each corner of the bridge. All probes
were taken down to the existing water table or to a depth of 3 m (9.8 ft). The decision to
excavate was the result of information accumulated during the background research and
the Houston PALM’s recommendations to deep test in Map Unit 1 areas.

METHODS
Background Review
The methods of investigation, carried out by Baker cultural resource personnel, consisted
of an in depth background research and archival investigation. Background research was
conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Prehistoric and Historic Site’s Atlas, The Handbook of Texas
History online, and the online National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listing. Aerial
photographs, historic maps, geologic maps, and soil survey maps were examined through
the Texas General Land Office, TerraServer USA (2005), Bureau of Economic Geology,
and Soil Conservation Survey (Crenwelge 1981).
Field Methods
The reconnaissance survey consisted of a visual inspection of all exposed ground surface
areas and cutbanks within the existing ROW of the proposed project area. Even though
the PSA is located in a heavily disturbed alluvial setting, the Houston PALM
recommends deep testing in this area. It was decided to deep test in order to satisfy the
recommendations of the Houston District PALM for Map Unit 1. A total of four 7.6 cm
(3 in) diameter auger probes were excavated. Auger probes were placed at the NE, NW,
SE and SW corners of the bridge, and excavated in 20 cm (7.9 in) arbitrary levels from
the ground surface to the existing water table. All soil was cut through with a trowel
instead of screened due to the consistency of the clay soil.
RESULTS
Background Review
Reviews of Brazoria County, Lake Jackson, and Oyster Creek revealed that the land
around Oyster Creek is extremely fertile and attracted many early Texas settlers to the
area. The area around and adjacent to Oyster Creek was first settled by cattlemen and
later was developed into sugar and cotton plantations (Kleiner 2001a). By 1880 the
community had a small, one-room school. Oyster Creek eventually became part of the
much larger Brazosport Industrial area in 1944. During the 1950s oyster shell
exploitation became a primary local industry. Oyster shells were used during this time
period primarily for road construction and the production of oyster shell buttons. Today
much of the area is owned by the state for use as prison farms.
Investigations at TARL and THC have shown that there have been many, overlapping
archeological surveys, several shell midden sites, and a burial site within the 1.6 km (1
mi) proximity of the engineered canal near Oyster Creek at CR 721-G. None of the sites,
however, were discovered in any of the surveyed areas.
The burial, archeological site 41BO4, was discovered on a narrow neck of land between
two streams of a loop in Oyster Creek . The loop is no longer an active stream flow as it
has been cut off by an artificial levee just north of the site (Calvert and Callihan 1962
[found in THC 2005]). Investigators from the Gulf Coast Archeological Society (GCAS)
excavated the site and recovered some bones of a single individual with a few grave

39

goods. The report, field notes, photos, and specimen inventory are all on file with
Brazoria County (THC 2005). The Galveston District Corp of Engineers (GACOE)
recorded archeological sites 41BO153, 41BO154, 41BO155, and 41BO156 well outside
of the designated survey area on an old levee on the east bank of Oyster Creek on their
way to the designated survey area (Good 1985 [found in THC 2005]). All sites are 2 to
3.5 miles northwest of the confluence of Oyster Creek with the Intercoastal Waterway.
Site 41BO153 was recorded as a possible prehistoric campsite with a limited occupation.
Rangia cuenta, ceramic sherds, and one small shell midden were located. Very little of
the site remains and none of the remaining site is believed to contain any integrity. Once
again, at site 41BO154, Rangia cuenta were scattered across the modern ground surface
as well as small fragments of deer and rabbit bone, and one small piece of burned clay.
All artifacts, which consisted of Rangia, oyster, and deer bone, located within the
designated boundary of 41BO155 were found on the modern ground surface. No other
features, artifacts, or in situ remains were identified. Site 41BO156 was located just south
of the canal subdivision and the proposed bridge replacement area. This site contained
Pre-Hispanic ceramics, shell, bone, three pieces of burned clay, one pebble core, one
chert flake, and an insitu midden features. Buried features were, however, immediately
below the ground surface. Because all sites were heavily eroded by Oyster Creek, gullied,
and sheet washed their ability to provide pertinent information about the lives of early
coastal people was determined to be very low to non-existent. No further work was
recommended at any of these sites.
Field Survey
On November 22, 2006, Ruth Mathews, from the Austin Baker office located the PSA
and examined the ground surface and cutbanks for cultural resources. No cultural
resources were located in cutbanks or on the ground surface. The entire PSA is situated in
a heavily disturbed alluvial setting, with an overall ground surface visibility that ranged
between zero and 100 percent. The area of the bridge over the engineered canal has been
artificially elevated. Other cultural and natural impacts include the creation of the canal,
the maintenance of the canal, the installation of wood pilings along the edge of the canal,
the addition of fill, and erosion from wave activity. Despite the lack of artifacts and the
degree of cultural and natural impacts, excavation of the area was determined necessary.
The decision to excavate is the result of the Houston District PALM criteria for
investigations in Map Unit 1, which states that there could be deeply buried cultural
resources in this area. Also, given that there are several prehistoric shell middens,
campsites, and a burial within one mile of the PSA, there existed the potential for the
discovery of deeply buried cultural remains.
Subsurface testing began at the site on December 5, 2006 by William Cody, also of the
Austin Baker office. Four auger probes (AP) were excavated at the site, with one AP at
each corner of the bridge crossing (Figure 4). Auger probe # 1, located east of the canal
and south of the road, was excavated down to 220 cm (86.6 in). The second AP, located
east of the canal and north of bridge, was taken down to 240 cm (94.5 in) below the
present ground surface. Auger Probe # 3, located west of the canal and south of the
bridge was excavated to a depth of 250 cm (98.4 in), and AP # 4, west of the canal and
north of the bridge, was taken down to 190 cm (74.8 in). The soils recorded from each

40

probe were not consistent with the Brazoria County Soils Survey definitions for the
Surfside–Velasco Soil Association (Crenwdge et al. 1981). All APs terminated at the
present water table. No cultural resources were recovered.

Clay soils were not screened. In order to maximize artifact recovery, excessively wet and
clayey soils were carefully divided with a hand trowel. The location and depth, soil
texture, structure, and color were recorded for each shovel test. Soil color was described
using the Munsell Color chart. One AP was profiled (Figure 5). There were no prehistoric
or historic artifacts or features discovered in any of the auger probes. All probes were
back-filled upon completion of the archeological recordation process.

recorded as mix of duff, rubble from bridge and road construction, and dredged channel
debris.

Field designation F4, first identified in AP 1, between 5 and 20 cmbs (7.9 in), was
recorded as yellowish red, 5YR5/8 sand and clay mix; fill.
Field designation F5, first identified in AP 1, between 20 and 80 cmbs (31.5 in), was
recorded as a reddish brown, 5YR4/4 clay mix. Mixture of different color clays, but
predominantly reddish brown; fill.
Field designation F6, first identified in AP 1, between 80 and 150 cmbs (59.1 in), was
recorded as a dark red, 2.5YR4/6 silty clay. Concrete fragment at 120 cmbs (47.2 in); fill
Field designation F7, first identified in AP 1, between 150 and 220 cmbs (86.6 in), was
recorded as a very dark gray, 10YR3/1 silty clay. This is believed to be the original
surface layer as described in the Brazoria County Soils Survey (Crenwelge et al. 1981).

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
As part of a Categorical Exclusion Documentation, the Austin Baker Cultural Resource
department conducted an archeological reconnaissance survey of approximately 0.1 ac
(0.04 ha) of Houston District – HPAs, Map Unit 1 at the intersection of CR 721-G and an
engineered canal in Brazoria County. The survey was conducted in order to assess the
effects of deep impacts on potential cultural resources within the existing right-of-way
(ROW) for a pending bridge and approach replacement project. The archeological
investigation included a background review and a reconnaissance survey augmented by
deep auger probes.
The reconnaissance survey consisted of a systematic surface inspection of areas that
offered ground surface visibility. Visibility ranged between zero and 30 percent. The area
with the best visibility was beneath the bridge where no vegetation grows. A total of four
subsurface probes were excavated at the site; one at each corner of the bridge. One auger
probe was profiled. The average overall depth was 225 cmbs (77.2 in). All probes were
terminated at the current water table. The auger probes revealed that at least the top 80 to
160 cm of soil is fill. All original ground surface is deeply buried at this location.
As a result of this survey, no previously unknown archeological cultural resources were
identified within the conceptual design boundaries of the proposed project, and no buried
cultural materials or buried living surfaces were identified. It is recommended that no
further intensive archeological survey is required, and TxDOT may proceed with the
proposed project. However, if any unknown cultural resources or human remains are
discovered during future project implementations within the current boundary, the
cultural and/or human remains should be protected from further impacts and all work in
the vicinity of the remains should cease, and the TxDOT Houston District and the
TxDOT Environmental Division should be notified immediately, as per standing
agreements.
