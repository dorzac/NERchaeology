COMMERCIALISM IN EAST TEXAS
ANTONIO A. ANDRETTA

Since the formation of the East Texas Archeological Society several members have undertaken the task of exploring ~the extent of commercialism in our area. The findings
have been appalling when one thinks of the cultural material
being moved from this area as well as the prices paid.
It was found that along the Sabine River several routes
are followed by these "buyers", all of whom work a given
route at a given time. Buying is done mostly from Negro
farmers who have sites on their land and who, having
gained a little wdtten knowledge as well as lining their
pockets with a good deal of loose change, have become
commercial archeologists. This situation has restricted the
genuine amateur from entering at least eighty per cent of
the known surface sites in that area.

·T he society has ascertained the present prices paid for
artifacts in this area and they are as follows: Small or
medium projectile points, twenty-five cents; spear points
or large projectile points, fifty cents to one dollar. Other
artifacts range from five cents to five dollars dependent
upon ~he beauty and the collector. Scottsbluff points are
never less than five dollars and usually more. The society
has the names of these "buyers", the artifacts purchased,
and the price paid. Some of these coiJ.lectors are members
of local societies and a few are members of TAS.
South of Tyler in an area roughly corresponding to that
of the Frankston Focus, pottery, points, and other artifacts
sell for much the same; however, one can obtain surface
hunting rights for a nominal fee. Both Negro and White
hunters can also be hired. This appears to be the case in
most instances. These hired hunters are willing to poach
on anyone's land in order to recover pottery or other artifacts desired by the hirer. Small Negro communities have
become the focal points in this quest to loot East Texas of
its Indian relics. The procedure is simple. One who desires
pottery goes to a given area, depending on the kind of pottery wanted, and hires several "diggers" who know where

to find burials and who systematically rob the graves for
capital gain. By disregarding everything except the pottery, they destroy not only the burials but the site as well.
Members of fue society visited several of these communities, and by bargaining with the "diggers", were able to note
their methods. It was found that these peopie also send
projectile points to other areas through magazine adds, for
which they receive good sums.
Before the creation of the East Texas Archeological Society many of its members indulged in such practices. Much
about these methods has been learned from them. This,
however, is not the case now. Because of the aims of the
society as set forth in the constitution, and the code of ethics
adopted by the members, we hope to eliminate such practices in the !future.
This situation does not exist in East Texas alone, of course,
but extends throughout Texas wherever archeological sites
are known to exist.
If commercialism is not curbed in the future, and its
accelerated rate not checked, many sites and areas will be
destroyed and the knowledge to be gained from them lost
forever. The saving of these sites and the passing of laws
against looting them rests entirely in the hands of those who
are scientifically interested in their preservation. We cannot afford to remain apathetic any longer.
It is my belief that a law must be adopted in Texas to
stop the wilful exploitation of our indian sites, and that only
a law which can and wi'll be enforced will suffice. Because
of the apathetic nature of the public in regard to archeological sites, only an aroused public can sponsor such a law
and its enforcement.
'T he East Texas Archeologkal Society is willing and ready
to work with any other groups, societies, and individuals to
stop the destruction and above aH to eliminate commerci:alism. Any suggestions or help will be gratefully appreciated. Letters should be addressed to the Secretary, East
Texas Archeoiogical Society, P. 0. Box 973, Tyler.
