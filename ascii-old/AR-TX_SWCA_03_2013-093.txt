ABSTRACT
On behalf of Black & Veatch Corporation (B&V) and San Antonio Water Systems (SAWS),
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for
Phase I of the proposed Brackish Groundwater Desalination Project County, Texas. Located in
southeastern Bexar County, the project area is approximately 4.2 miles southeast of the Interstate
Highway 37 (IH 37) and Loop 1604 intersection, and about 10 miles southwest of Elmendorf,
Texas. This report includes the results of investigations of the water production and injection well
pipeline alignments as designed on July 5, 2013. Several alignment changes and reroutes were
implemented through the duration of the project and were surveyed on three separate field survey
efforts. The work was conducted on behalf of B&V and SAWS, a political subdivision of the State
of Texas, as part of their compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) under Permit
Number 6445. Additionally the project is subject to compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) in anticipation of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Fort Worth
District, Section 404 Nationwide 12 permit in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the
Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents
dated April 25, 2005 and January 31, 2007).
SAWS proposes to install a new water production pipeline whose diameter would vary from 12–
36 inches with associated laterals and 13 production wells, an injection well pipeline and three
injection wells, three access roads, and a new 14-acre desalination facility. Installation of the
pipeline will require trenching and boring within the 100-foot-wide construction easement that is
generally adjacent to existing utility easements. The depth of disturbances will be 5–10 feet deep
throughout, while bore pits will be 10–22 feet deep. The area of potential effects (APE) is a
construction easement that is approximately 12 miles long and 100 feet wide (159.5 acres),
including the 14-acre desalination facility. The APE for the proposed access roads is
approximately 2.2 miles in length and 50 feet wide (13 acres). Vertical disturbances will range in
depth from 0–22 feet deep.
The investigations included a background review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel
testing of the project area boundaries. The background review determined that 1.57 miles of the
project area had been previously surveyed and that one cemetery is adjacent to the APE. The
historic map review determined there are no historic-age properties within the APE. During the
archaeological survey, SWCA archaeologists examined the entire 12 miles of proposed APE and
the 14-acre facility, as well as 2.2 miles of proposed access roads. Overall, the intensive pedestrian
survey revealed that the proposed project area is within a rural setting intersected by drive-ways,
fence lines, overhead utility lines, and existing underground utilities. One of the main focuses of
the survey was to verify the location of the John Shock Shely Cemetery (site 41BX1463) identified
during the background review. The initial review depicted three different locations of the cemetery
with one within the 14-acre facility. The results of the survey, along with additional archival
research, pinned down the cemetery to one location outside of the APE. In addition, one new
prehistoric site (site 41BX1963) was documented within the project area.
Site 41BX1963, a prehistoric lithic scatter, is considered not eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL), based on the lack
of cultural integrity, research potential, and overall prior disturbances. Additional archival research

i

is needed on the John Shock Shely Cemetery to determine its NRHP eligibility and SAL
designation status, and therefore the site’s eligibility status remains undetermined. Because of the
uncertainty of the location of unmarked burials within the cemetery, a 200-foot buffer was
implemented around the existing cemetery boundary to ensure that no unmarked burials will be
affected during the proposed construction activities. The proposed SAWS July 5, 2013 alignment
and APE will avoid the recommended 200-foot buffer around the current cemetery.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify
cultural resource properties within the APE. As no properties were identified that may meet the
criteria for listing in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL, according
to 13 TAC 26.8, SWCA recommends no further cultural resources work within the project area.

INTRODUCTION

The depth of disturbances will be 5–10 feet
deep throughout, while bore pits will be 10–22
feet deep. The area of potential effects (APE) is
a construction easement that is approximately
12 miles long and 100 feet wide (159.5 acres),
including the 14-acre desalination facility. The
APE for the proposed access roads is
approximately 2.2 miles and 50 feet wide (13
acres). Vertical disturbances will range in
depth from 0–22 feet deep. Although NHPA
compliance may trigger cultural resource
investigations related to indirect impacts to
historic standing structures or other cultural
resources in the area in relation to the proposed
14-acre facility, SWCA determined there are
no standing structures within a 300-foot radius
of the proposed facility that would require a
historic survey.

SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources
survey for Phase I of the proposed San Antonio
Water System (SAWS) Brackish Groundwater
Desalination Project (Figure 1). Located in
southeastern Bexar County, Texas, the project
area is approximately 4.2 miles southeast of the
Interstate Highway 37 (IH 37) and Loop 1604
intersection, and about 10 miles southwest of
Elmendorf, Texas.
The work was conducted on behalf of Black &
Veatch Corporation (B&V) and SAWS, a
political subdivision of the State of Texas, as
part of their compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT) under Permit Number
6445. Additionally, the project is subject to
compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) in anticipation of a
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Forth
Worth District, Section 404 Nationwide 12
permit in accordance with 33 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C
(Processing Department of Army Permits:
Procedures for the Protection of Historic
Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current
Interim Guidance Documents dated April 25,
2005 and January 31, 2007).

Several alignment changes and reroutes were
implemented throughout the duration of the
project and were surveyed during four separate
field survey events. The initial February 13,
2013, alignment was surveyed on February 20–
21, 2013. A subsequent February 26, 2013,
alignment was surveyed on April 3–5, 2013.
The following report includes the results of
investigations of these previous alignments and
of the May 29, 2013 alignment and the final
July 5, 2013 alignment, surveyed on June 12–
14, 2013 and August 12, 2013 (Appendix A).
The access roads were surveyed on August 27–
28, 2013. Due to the project’s proximity to the
John Shock Shely Cemetery, an interim report
was submitted to the State Historic
Preservation Officer and Texas Historical
Commission (THC) on behalf of the client for
an expedited review of the February 26, 2013,
alignment and desalination facility location.

SAWS proposes to install a new water
production pipeline whose diameter would
vary from 12–36 inches with associated laterals
and 13 production wells, a new 14-acre
desalination facility, and a new injection well
pipeline and three injection wells. The entire
project will be within SAWS property and the
proposed 14-acre facility will be an extension
of the existing water treatment plant (Figure 2).
Installation of the pipeline will require
trenching and boring within the 100-foot wide
construction easement that is generally
adjacent to existing utility easements. In
addition, three access roads totaling 2.2 miles

SWCA recommended a 200-foot buffer around
the cemetery for avoidance. The report was
submitted in March 2013 to obtain concurrence
on the results of the survey, the level of field
efforts with respect to the cemetery, and
SWCA’s recommendations. The THC
concurred with SWCA’s 200-foot avoidance
buffer in April 2013.

The proposed 14-acre desalination facility will
be an extension of the existing 140-acre SAWS
water treatment plant (Figure 2). The proposed
work would involve the construction of new
storage tanks, roads, and structures within the
existing facility and the 14-acre survey area.
The project area is generally within a rural
setting, with the northern end less developed
than the southern end. Towards the southern
end, the project area crosses several large acre
residential tracts and streets, including Mathis
Road and Hardy Road. The northern portion is
entirely within undeveloped land primarily
used for ranching. In addition, the northern
portion of the APE is co-located beside an
existing SAWS pipeline.

The investigations consisted of an intensive
archaeological survey with shovel testing of the
proposed APE. All investigations were
conducted in accordance with THC and
Council of Texas Archeologist (CTA)
standards, as well as the guidelines provided in
Section 106 of the NHPA. Laura I. Acuña
served as Principal Investigator. Matthew
Stotts conducted the survey with archaeologists
Walker Van Item and Kathryn A. Sloan on
February 20–21, 2013. Christina Nielsen
conducted the survey with archaeologists
Alamea Young and Kathryn A. Sloan on April
3–5, 2013. The June 12–14, 2013, survey was
conducted by Matthew Stotts with Greg
Sundborg and Kathryn A. Sloan.

GEOLOGY
Geologically, the project area is mapped as 100
percent Tertiary-age Carrizo Sand (Barnes
1983). These deposits consist of thick beds of
medium to coarse grained sandstone, 140–200
feet thick (Barnes 1983).

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

SOILS

The project starts near the intersection of
Interstate Highway (IH) 37 and Hardy Road,
approximately 17 miles south of San Antonio,
Texas. From this intersection, the production
pipeline extends east for 2.86 miles, paralleling
Hardy Road, until passing through an existing
SAWS water treatment plant located south of
Hardy Road. Two laterals extend south from
this section of the pipeline for approximately
0.42 mile and 0.88 mile, respectively. From the
SAWS facility, the production pipeline extends
northeast for 4.4 miles with several laterals
totaling 0.59 mile deviating from the
centerline. The northern portion of the
alignment parallels an existing SAWS pipeline
for about 1.25 miles. The proposed injection
pipeline will extend south from the proposed
14-acre desalination facility for approximately
1.88 miles, up to Wilson County.

The overall project area soils are mapped as 69
percent Aluf sand with 0 to 5 percent slopes,
followed by 10 percent Floresville fine sandy
loam with 3 to 5 percent slopes, 10 percent
Wilco fine sand with 0 to 3 percent slopes, 4
percent Miguel fine sandy loam with 1 to 3
percent slopes, 4 percent Duval loam fine sand
with 1 to 5 percent slopes, and 2 percent
Floresville fine sandy loam with 1 to 3 percent
slopes (Taylor et al. 1991; NRCS 2013). The
soils within the 14-acre study area are roughly
divided between Aluf sand to the west and
Wilco fine sand to the east.
The Aluf series consists of very deep,
excessively-drained, and rapidly permeable
sandy soils. These soils, on nearly level to
gently undulating uplands, formed in sandy
sediments of the Carrizo Sand Formation.
4

These soils were formerly included in the
Eufaula series (NRCS 2013).

archaeological records and projectile point
style sequences contain elements that suggest
influences from and varying degrees of contact
over time with other areas such as the Lower
Pecos and Gulf Coastal Plain (Collins 2004;
Johnson and Goode 1994). For more-complete
bibliographies concerning archaeological work
done in the region, see Black (1989), Collins
(1995), and Johnson and Goode (1994).

The Wilco series consists of very deep, welldrained, and slowly permeable soils that
formed in sandy alluvium and eolian deposits
over clayey residuum that was weathered from
sandstone and shale. These soils are on nearly
level to sloping paleoterraces (NRCS 2013).
Similarly, the Floresville series consists of very
deep, well-drained, slowly permeable soils that
formed in loamy alluvium over interbedded
clayey residuum derived from sandstone.
These nearly level-to-gently sloping soils are
also on remnant stream terraces.

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Surficial and deeply buried sites, rockshelter
sites, and isolated artifacts represent
Paleoindian (11,500–8800 B.P.) occupations of
the Central Texas region (Collins 2004:116).
The period is often described as having been
characterized by small but highly mobile bands
of foragers who were specialized hunters of
Pleistocene megafauna. But Paleoindians
probably used a much wider array of resources
(Meltzer and Bever 1995:59), including small
fauna and plant foods. Faunal remains from
Kincaid Rockshelter and the Wilson-Leonard
site (41WM235) support this view (Bousman
1998; Collins 1998; Collins et al. 1989).
Longstanding ideas about Paleoindian
technologies also are being challenged.

CULTURAL SETTING
The proposed project area falls within Central
Texas Archeological Region (Perttula 2004).
Although the archaeological regions are not
absolute, they do generally reflect recognized
biotic communities and physiographic areas in
Texas (Perttula 2004:6). The Central Texas
Region, as its name implies, is in the center of
Texas and covers the Edwards Plateau and
portions of the Blackland prairie east of the
Edwards Plateau. The following synopses
provide basic culture histories of the Central
Texas region.

Collins (2004) divides the Paleoindian period
into early and late subperiods. Two projectile
point styles, Clovis and Folsom, are included in
the early subperiod. Clovis chipped stone
artifact assemblages, including the diagnostic
fluted lanceolate Clovis point, were produced
by bifacial, flake, and prismatic-blade
techniques on high-quality and oftentimes
exotic lithic materials (Collins 1990). Along
with chipped stone artifacts, Clovis
assemblages include engraved stones, bone and
ivory points, stone bolas, and ochre (Collins
2004:116; Collins et al. 1992). Clovis points
are found evenly distributed along the eastern
edge of the Edwards Plateau, where the
presence of springs and outcrops of chertbearing limestone are common (Meltzer and
Bever 1995:58). Sites within the area yielding

PREHISTORIC
The archaeological record of the Central Texas
region is known from decades of investigations
of stratified open air sites and rockshelters
throughout the Edwards Plateau, its highly
dissected eastern and southern margins, and the
adjoining margins of physiographic regions to
the east and south (see Collins [2004] for
review). Traditionally, the Central Texas
archaeological area has included the Balcones
Canyonlands and Blackland Prairie—that is,
north of San Antonio (e.g., Prewitt 1981; Suhm
1960). These two areas are on the periphery of
the Central Texas archaeological area, and their
5

Clovis points and Clovis-age materials include
Kincaid Rockshelter (Collins et al. 1989), Pavo
Real (Henderson and Goode 1991), and San
Macros Springs (Takac 1991). A probable
Clovis polyhedral blade core and blade
fragment was found at the Greenbelt site in San
Antonio (Houk et al. 1997). Analyses of Clovis
artifacts and site types suggest that Clovis
peoples were well-adapted, generalized huntergatherers with the technology to hunt larger
game but not solely rely on it.

southwestern United States and on the Great
Plains, development of horticultural-based,
semisedentary to sedentary societies succeeds
the Archaic period. In these areas, the Archaic
truly represents a developmental stage of
adaptation as Willey and Phillips (1958) define
it. For Central Texas, this notion of the Archaic
is somewhat problematic. An increasing
amount of evidence suggests that Archaic-like
adaptations were in place before the Archaic
(see Collins 2004:118, 1998; Collins et al.
1989) and that these practices continued into
the succeeding Late Prehistoric period (Collins
1995:385; Prewitt 1981:74). In a real sense, the
Archaic period of Central Texas region is not a
developmental stage, but an arbitrary
chronological construct and projectile point
style sequence. Establishment of this sequence
is based on several decades of archaeological
investigations at stratified Archaic sites along
the eastern and southern margins of the
Edwards Plateau. Collins (1995, 2004) and
Johnson and Goode (1994) have divided this
sequence into three parts—early, middle, and
late—based on perceived (though not fully
agreed upon by all scholars) technological,
environmental, and adaptive changes.

In contrast, Folsom tool kits—consisting of
fluted Folsom points, thin unfluted (Midland)
points, large thin bifaces, and end scrapers—
are more indicative of specialized hunting,
particularly of bison (Collins 2004:117).
Folsom points have been recovered from
Kincaid Rockshelter (Collins et al. 1989) and
Pavo Real (Henderson and Goode 1991).
Postdating Clovis and Folsom points in the
archaeological record are a series of dart point
styles (primarily unfluted lanceolate darts) for
which the temporal, technological, or cultural
significance is unclear. Often, the Plainview
type name is assigned these dart points, but
Collins (2004:117) has noted that many of
these points typed as Plainview do not
resemble Plainview type-site points in thinness
and flaking technology. Nonetheless, it has
become clear that the artifact and feature
assemblages of the later Paleoindian subperiod
appear to be Archaic-like in nature and in many
ways may represent a transition between the
early Paleoindian and succeeding Archaic
periods (Collins 2004:118).

The use of rock and earth ovens (and the
formation of burned rock middens) for
processing and cooking plant foods suggests
that this technology was part of a generalized
foraging strategy. The amount of energy
involved in collecting plants, constructing hot
rock cooking appliances, and gathering fuel
ranks most plant foods relatively low, based on
the resulting caloric return (Dering 1999). This
suggests that plant foods were part of a broadbased diet (Kibler and Scott 2000:134) or part
of a generalized foraging strategy, an idea
Prewitt (1981) put forth earlier. At times during
the Late Archaic, this generalized foraging
strategy appears to have been marked by shifts
to a specialized economy focused on bison
hunting (Kibler and Scott 2000:125–137).
Castroville, Montell, and Marcos dart points
are elements of tool kits often associated with

ARCHAIC PERIOD
The Archaic period for Central Texas dates
from ca. 8800 to 1300–1200 B.P. (Collins
2004:119–121) and generally is believed to
represent a shift toward hunting and gathering
of a wider array of animal and plant resources
and a decrease in group mobility (Willey and
Phillips 1958:107–108). In the eastern and
6

the Austin and Toyah phases could easily and
appropriately represent the break between the
Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric.

bison hunting (Collins 1968). Archaeological
evidence of this association is seen at Bonfire
Shelter in Val Verde County (Dibble and
Lorrain 1968), Jonas Terrace (Johnson 1995),
Oblate Rockshelter (Johnson et al. 1962:116),
John Ischy (Sorrow 1969), and Panther Springs
Creek (Black and McGraw 1985).

HISTORIC PERIOD
The historic period in Texas began in 1528 near
Galveston Island with the encounter between
the Pánfilo de Narváez expedition and a
Karankawa group. After disaster befell the
expedition, one of the members, Cabeza de
Vaca, spent six years of wandering through
Texas in the 1530s. Cabeza de Vaca traversed
coastal Texas and parts of the interior and
recounted in great ethnographic detail the
peoples he encountered. Based in part from his
exploits and suggestions of a kingdom of gold,
the Coronado expedition was formed to search
for a “northern” Cuzco or Teotihuacan, and by
1540 it crossed into New Mexico and into
Texas (Fehrenbach 2011).

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
Introduction of the bow and arrow and later,
ceramics into Central Texas, marked the Late
Prehistoric period. Population densities
dropped considerably from their Late Archaic
peak (Prewitt 1985:217). Subsistence strategies
did not differ greatly from the preceding
period, although bison again became an
important economic resource during the late
part of the Late Prehistoric period (Prewitt
1981:74). Use of rock and earth ovens for plant
food processing and the subsequent
development of burned rock middens
continued throughout the Late Prehistoric
period (Black et al. 1997; Kleinbach et al.
1995:795). Horticulture came into play very
late in the region but was of minor importance
to overall subsistence strategies (Collins
2004:122).

The following historic discussion focuses on
the San Antonio region and the significance of
this region during the historic period and the
creation of Texas independence, sovereignty,
and statehood.
EARLY HISTORIC TO 1718

In Central Texas, the Late Prehistoric period
generally is associated with the Austin and
Toyah phases (Jelks 1962; Prewitt 1981:82–
84). Austin and Toyah phase horizon markers
and Scallorn-Edwards and Perdiz arrow points,
respectively, are distributed across most of the
state. Violence and conflict often marked
introduction of Scallorn and Edwards arrow
points into Central Texas—many excavated
burials contain these point tips in contexts
indicating they were the cause of death (Prewitt
1981:83).
Subsistence
strategies
and
technologies (other than arrow points) did not
change much from the preceding Late Archaic
period. Prewitt’s (1981) use of the term
“Neoarchaic” recognizes this continuity. In
fact, Johnson and Goode (1994:39–40) and
Collins (2004:122) state that the break between

The Native Americans living in the missions
along the San Antonio River were referred to
by the Spanish as “Coahuiltecans.” The name
comes from a southern tribe named after the
Spanish province of Coahuila, which later
became a Mexican state. The term
Coahuiltecan is a generalized term and makes
no distinction between language and cultural
differences of the tribes living in the area. The
abundant berries, nuts, and fish made San
Pedro Springs an attractive place to camp
and/or live (Johnston 1947).
The San Antonio area was first explored in
1691 by the Governor of the Spanish Province
of Texas, Domingo Terán de los Ríos and
Father Damián Massenet. The pair traveled to

Juan Leal Goraz, the village of San Fernando
de Béxar was founded near the Presidio de
Béxar and the first civil government in Texas
was formed.

San Pedro Springs where they encountered a
hunter-gather tribe named Payaya. In their
village, named Yanaguana, the Payaya lived in
simple huts made of brushwood and grass. The
river and village were renamed after San
Antonio de Padua by Terán and Massenet
(Johnston 1947).

In 1773, San Antonio de Béxar became the
capital of Spanish Texas. By 1790, most of the
Indians living in San Antonio had either
already abandoned the missions or died from
diseases like smallpox and the measles brought
in by Europeans. Mission San Antonio de
Valero was secularized in 1794 and mission
land, excluding the church and convent, was
divided among the few Indians that remained
in the area (Johnston 1947).

Further Spanish exploration was conducted in
1709 by Father Antonio de San Buenaventura
y Olivares. Father Olivares was the first to
express interest in setting up a mission in the
San Antonio area (Fehrenbach 2011; Johnston
1947).
SPANISH TEXAS: 1718 TO 1820

Spain and Mexican revolutionists fought over
San Antonio throughout the early 1800s. The
Casas revolt of 1811 ended with the assertion
of power by the Spanish regime. Captain Juan
Bautista de las Casas went against the Spanish
authority and was arrested and sent to Mexico.
In Monclova, he was tried and found guilty of
treason and shot to death. His head was sent
back to San Antonio as a sign of defeat
(Caldwell 2011).

San Antonio de Béxar Presidio, located on the
east bank of the San Antonio River, was
founded in 1718. In the same year, Mission San
Antonio de Valero, later known as the Alamo,
was transferred from the Rio Grande by Father
Olivares. This mission was named after St.
Anthony of Padua and the Marquis de Valero,
the Viceroy of New Spain. The church was
originally constructed of adobe and the huts of
wood and thatch (Johnston 1947; Schoelwer
2011).

San Antonio declared for Mexican
independence in 1813 but was recaptured by
Royalist forces in the battles of Alazán Creek
and Medina. During this period of unrest,
conditions in Texas were becoming worse.
Inadequate
provisions
and
neglected
agricultural fields, along with the fear of
political and military upheavals, forced many
Texans to abandon their homes and move
elsewhere (Fehrenbach 2011; Heusinger 1951).

La Villita, an Indian village about 1,500 feet
south of the Alamo, was built around 1722. The
Indians from the Mission San Antonio de
Valero lived in La Villita in crude huts called
“jacales” (Johnston 1947:31). Jacales were
typically constructed with an upright line of
poles sunk into a footing ditch and then woven
horizontally with smaller sticks. The walls
were subsequently covered with adobe. Later,
La Villita served as a home to the families of
soldiers who protected the mission (Johnston
1947; Magruder 2011).

TEXAS REVOLUTION, INDEPENDENCE, AND
STATEHOOD: 1820 TO 1848
During the Texas Revolution, San Antonio was
the site of several battles, including the siege of
Bexar and the battle of the Alamo (Fehrenbach
2011).

The villa of San Fernando de Béxar was
founded in 1731 by the Canary Islanders. The
Canary Islanders were a small group, totaling
56 people, sent by Spain to colonize the
province of Texas. Under the leadership of
8

General Santa Anna arrived in San Antonio
with between 1,800 and 2,100 men on February
23, 1836. Upon their arrival, Colonel Travis
ordered his men to retreat into the Alamo
(Hatch 1999). General Santa Anna raised a red
flag signifying “no quarter–no mercy” and
received a cannon shot from the Texians in
defiance (Hatch 1999:20). Another defiant
cannon is rumored to have been shot in
response to a request for an unconditional
surrender. In a letter sent February 24, 1836,
addressed to the “People of Texas and all
Americans in the World,” Colonel Travis pleas
for assistance and states “if this call is
neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as
long as possible & die like a soldier who never
forgets what is due his own honor & that of his
country. Victory or Death” (Groneman
2001:6).

General Martín Perfecto de Cós, along with
650 men, fortified the plaza of San Antonio de
Béxar west of the San Antonio River and the
Alamo to the east. Texan volunteers arrived in
San Antonio on October 12, 1835, to set up
camp. Upon hearing that the Mexican army’s
morale and rations were low, a council was
held to decide whether to attack. Commanding
Officer, Edward Burleson and most of the other
officers voted to end the siege. One man spoke
up and asked “Who will go with Old Ben
Milam into San Antonio?” (House 1949:47).
Approximately 300 men joined Milam and the
battle finally began on December 5, 1835.
General Cós focused his troops at the Alamo
but was unsuccessful in holding San Antonio.
By the morning of December 9, 1835, Cós
surrendered (House 1949).
On February 23, 1836, nearly 150 American
volunteers took refuge from the approaching
Mexican Army in the Alamo Mission in San
Antonio, Texas under orders from Colonel
William B. Travis (Hatch 1999). A standoff
between the Texas Revolutionary Army and
the Mexican Army, lasting 13 days, ended in
complete annihilation of the Alamo defenders
and a victory for the Mexican General Antonio
Lopez de Santa Anna (Huffines 1999).

Over the next few days the Alamo defenders
suffered shortages of provisions and water,
constant bombardment on the Alamo and
psychological warfare through the nights
ordered by General Santa Anna. On the third
day of the siege, Mexican troops created a
diversion at the Alamo’s main gate in an
attempt to cross the San Antonio River and
reach the south wall of the Alamo through La
Villita. The Texians repelled both attacks and
subsequently burned buildings in close
proximity to the Alamo to deny shelter for
Santa Anna’s men in La Villita (Hatch 1999).
General Santa Anna ordered many small
attacks in an attempt to breach the Alamo’s
walls. Many Mexicans lost their lives in the
process; however, no Texians were killed in the
12-day siege before the final battle (Hatch
1999; Huffines 1999).

The Alamo Garrison had been acquired
following the defeat of Mexican General
Martin Perfecto de Cós’ army in the December
1835, Battle of San Antonio. The subsequent
formation of the Matamoros Expedition cost
the Alamo much needed supplies and men.
This expedition was created with the intention
of invading Mexico through the city of
Matamoros; however, the plan was never
executed due to political turmoil in the Texas
government. Some relief came over the next
few months with the arrivals of Colonel Jim
Bowie, Colonel William B. Travis, and David
Crockett; each bringing 12 to 30 additional
men. Rumors of the approaching Mexican
army of nearly 2,000 men soon followed
(Hatch 1999).

On March 4, 1836, General Santa Anna held a
Council of War to decide plans of attack and
the fate of prisoners. The final decision to
attack the Alamo with full force was made the
following day, March 5, 1836 (Hatch 1999).
The Mexican army moved into position just
after midnight on March 6, 1836, and waited
9

for the signal to attack. This call came around
five o’clock in the morning when a soldier
cried out “Viva Santa Anna!” (Huffines
1999:134). With the element of surprise lost,
Santa Anna ordered his troops to begin the
attack on the Alamo garrison (Huffines 1999).

you observe historic missions and Victorian
mansions built next to modern offices and
homes (Fehrenbach 2011).
On March 2, 1861, Texas seceded from the
Union and soon after the Civil War began. San
Antonio was a Confederate storage area as well
as a location to form military units; however,
the city kept its distance from most of the
fighting (Fehrenbach 2011).

The vicious battle, lasting only 90 minutes, left
every Texian combatant dead. The number of
Mexican dead is a matter of debate, with
numbers ranging from 100–1,600; uncounted
more were wounded. The Texian’s bodies were
burned on funeral pyres on either side of the
Alameda. Santa Anna won the battle at the
Alamo but victory and independence was won
by the Texans two weeks later in the Battle of
San Jacinto (Hatch 1999; Huffines 1999).

After the Civil War, industries such as cattle,
distribution, ranching, mercantile, gas and oil,
and military centers in San Antonio prospered.
The arrival of a railway transportation system
in San Antonio in 1877 inspired economic
growth throughout the city (Fehrenbach 2011;
House 1949). Modernization increased
dramatically between the 1880s and the 1890s,
compared to the rest of the United States. Civic
government, utilities, electric lights, street
railways, street paving and maintenance, water
supply, telephones, hospitals, and a power
plant were all established or planned around
this time (Fehrenbach 2011).

After Mexican forces were removed from San
Antonio in December of 1836, the Republic of
Texas began organizing Bexar County. The
next month, San Antonio was chartered as the
county seat. Despite these progressions, many
conflicts continued to occur in San Antonio,
including the Council House Fight of 1840 and
two Mexican invasions in 1842 (Fehrenbach
2011).

1900 TO 1950

After Texas entered the Union in 1845, San
Antonio’s already diverse population grew
dramatically. The Irish came to Texas in the
late 1830s to early 1840s and established Irish
Flat. Germans settled in San Antonio in the
1850s, introducing the Bier Halle to the area.
French immigrants added artists and artisans to
the culture of the city. Later immigrants to the
area included Polish, Italians, Greeks, Syrians,
and in 1910, Chinese—all of whom formed
small communities within the City of San
Antonio.

In 1921, a disastrous flood engulfed Houston
Street and St. Mary’s Street with
approximately 9 feet of water. In response to
this event, the Olmos Dam was built to prevent
further flooding and sections of the San
Antonio River were straightened and widened
as well. Another recommendation was to
construct an underground channel in
downtown San Antonio and to cover portions
of the river with concrete. This last idea upset
many people, but eventually the compromise
was reached by creating a riverwalk with shops
and restaurants. Construction of this riverwalk
was completed in 1941 (Long 2011).

Culture and architecture from each immigrant
community have seeped into San Antonio and
merged together, forming a rich cultural
community. This diverse culture is evident as

San Antonio became an important military
center and other city activities and construction
ceased for nearly 5 years. Fort Sam Houston,

reviewed to assist in identifying any historic
resources or disturbances.

Tourism is one of the San Antonio’s most
important industries, drawing tens of thousands
of visitors every year. More recent features
include theme parks, zoos, museums, gardens,
parks, and sporting attractions. The San
Antonio Riverwalk, also known as the Paseo
del Rio, consists of more than 2.5 miles of
shops and restaurants, as well as a boat ride
along the channel. This is one of San Antonio’s
most visited attractions.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY

METHODS

Shovel tests were systematically excavated
within the project area. THC survey standards
call for the excavation of 16 shovel tests per
mile for linear projects with a 100-foot-wide
ROW and one shovel test per 2 acres for area
surveys between 11–100 acres, or 199 shovel
tests for the project area. Shovel tests were
approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter
and excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels to 1 m
in depth or to culturally sterile deposits,
whichever came first. The matrix was screened
through ¼-inch mesh. The location of each
shovel test was plotted using a hand-held GPS
receiver and each test was recorded on
appropriate project field forms.

SWCA’s investigations consisted of an
intensive pedestrian survey with subsurface
investigations within the project area.
Archaeologists examined the ground surface,
erosional profiles, and exposures for cultural
resources. Subsurface investigations involved
shovel testing in settings with the potential to
contain buried cultural materials.

BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA performed a cultural resources file
records review to determine if the proposed
APE has been previously surveyed for cultural
resources or if any archaeological sites have
been recorded within or adjacent to the APE.
To conduct this review, an SWCA
archaeologist reviewed portions of the Leming
(2998-122), Losoya (2998-123), and Saspamco
(2998-124) USGS 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle maps on the THC Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas). This source
provided information on the nature and
location
of
previously
conducted
archaeological surveys, previously recorded
cultural resource sites, locations of National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties,
sites designated as State Antiquities

SWCA conducted a non-collection survey.
Artifacts, had any been encountered, would
have been tabulated, analyzed, and
documented in the field, but not collected.
11

A portion of the project area was previously
surveyed in 2002 during a reconnaissance
survey of the SAWS-Aquifer Storage Recharge
(ASR) Water Transmission Line project under
Antiquities Permit 2633 (Moreman and Feit
2002). A reconnaissance level survey of the
proposed well sites was also conducted in 2010
for an environmental assessment of the SAWS
Brackish Water Desalination Production Well
Design (BAER 2011). No cultural resources
were encountered during the limited survey.
The 2002 reconnaissance survey was
conducted to determine which areas of the
proposed transmission line would require
intensive survey. Approximately 2.83 miles of
the current project area is within and parallel to
the
previous
reconnaissance-level
investigation, which was not recommended for
additional intensive survey (Moreman and Feit
2002). Two of the four sites recorded during
this investigation are adjacent to the current
project area. Prehistoric site 41BX1461 is lithic
scatter consisting of two projectile point
fragments, flakes, and debitage. The site is
located approximately 197 meters north of one
of the project area laterals and was
recommended as not eligible inclusion to the
NRHP (Moreman and Feit 2002).

SITE EVALUATIONS
All newly documented archaeological sites
were evaluated according to the National
Register Criteria for Evaluation (Criteria) as
codified in 36 Code of Federal Regulations,
Chapter 60.4, which states: The quality of
significance in American history, architecture,
archeology, engineering, and culture is present
in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and
objects that possess integrity of location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have
made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons
significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics
of a type, period, or method of construction, or
that represent the work of a master, or that
possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield,
information important in prehistory or history.

Site 41BX1463 is a small cemetery consisting
of five headstones within a cleared agricultural
field (Atlas 2013). The cemetery was recorded
within an unfenced, depressed circular area on
a small rise in the middle of the field. The site
was documented as roughly 600 square feet in
size. Only one headstone was upright and the
inscriptions on the stones were recorded as: J.
S. SHELY / 1818–1875; SUSAN SHELY / WIFE OF
J.S. 1839–1916; RAYMOND LEE FLEMING / 19181919; MINNE THEADOSIA / WIFE OF CHAS. TOTTY
1861–1916; and DOROTHY MARIE SHELY / 1924–
1927 (Atlas 2013).

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review determined that
portions of the project area have been
previously surveyed, and two previously
recorded sites are adjacent to the project area,
including site 41BX1461, a prehistoric lithic
scatter, and the John Shock Shely cemetery
recorded as site 41BX1463. In addition,
another cemetery and a previously conducted
survey are within a 1-mile radius of the project
area.

the cemetery notes Rachel Williams as Susan’s
mother and that she lived in Atascosa County
with her husband, William C. Rutledge
(Ancestry 2013). In 2007, the San Antonio
Genealogical & Historical Society (SAGHS)
listed Shely Cemetery in their Cemeteries of
Bexar County, Texas Volume 4 (SAGHS
2007). The listing included a map, coordinates,
and catalogues four burials consisting of J.S.
Shely (1818-??), Susan Shely (1839–1916),
Minnie Theodosia Totty (1861–1916), and
Raymond Lee Fleming (1919–1919).

Cemetery—however, both are designated
Cemetery No. BX-C189. Thus, the two names
both refer to 41BX1463, which is also known
as the Old Shely Cemetery. The ShelleyFleming Cemetery is depicted within the 14acre facility site; however, additional
information on when this location was
documented is not available on Atlas or at the
THC. The cemetery was estimated to contain
50 burials during a revisit in 2008, when its size
was recorded as 122 feet by 161 feet (Atlas).
PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CEMETERY
HISTORY

SAWS acquired the property with the cemetery
sometime after the year 2000. After the ASR
Transmission
Line
Project
survey
investigations documented the cemetery under
41BX1463, SAWS constructed a pipe fence
around the tombstones in 2006. SAWS issued
a letter to Mr. E.W. Wilburn, a Shely
descendent, that same year to allow access into
the property for visitation (THC 2008).

The additional research encountered different
reiterations of the names and dates on the
tombstones. The following will detail the
findings as they are reported in the original
sources. The cemetery was originally
documented sometime in 1998, and reported on
a family tree website hosted by RootsWeb and
Ancestry.com, a genealogical search engine
(Ancestry 2013). The website includes a brief
family history of the Rutledge and Shely
families (spelled Sheley on website) posted by
descendants. Individuals who visited the
cemetery in 1998 took photographs of the five
tombstones and conducted local interviews.
The website notes that a new stone was placed
at the cemetery for Dorothy Marie Shely by her
brother Ule Shely a year before. The locals
from the vicinity state that there were 50 graves
with 15 to 20 tombstones visible on the
landscape at one time. A former landowner
plowed and mowed over the tombstones
displacing them on the surface (Ancestry
2013).

In January 2008, Mr. E.W. Wilburn, grandson
of Ule Ray Shely, submitted a Historic Texas
Cemetery application with supporting
documentation to the THC and the cemetery
was set aside and dedicated in March 2008. Mr.
Ule Ray Shely, who was 84 at the time of the
application, recalled that John Shock Shely was
once a captain of the Texas Rangers and the
first to be buried at the cemetery (THC 2008).
His sister, Dorothy Marie Shely was buried in
1927, and his cousin Raymond Lee Fleming
was buried in 1918. Mr. Ule Shely also reports
that three uncles were buried at the cemetery
but did not have a stone or marker. The
application notes that up to 50 burials exist
within the cemetery based on local lore, some
with no markers, while others were destroyed
intentionally by the previous landowner during
agricultural activities (THC 2008).

The cemetery is also noted in a self-published
book called the Cemeteries of Wilson County
by Irma M. Meyr. The date of publication was
not listed but it notes three burials within the
cemetery consisting of Susan Shely (18391916), Theodosia (Shely) Rutledge Potty (??1916), and Rachel Williams. The accuracy of
the listing is questionable due to the lack of

with 160 acres deeded to J.S. Shely by the
governor, he also purchased 250 acres from

was recorded within the project area and
evaluated for NRHP eligibility.
Field investigations encountered a mostly rural
environment consisting of large acre residential
tracts, agricultural fields, and undeveloped
parcels along much of the APE. The
southwestern portion of the project area, from
IH 37 to the existing SAWS facility, is
intersected by several property fence lines,
driveways, and overhead utility lines. In
addition, above-ground water collection lines
intersected and paralleled portions of the
alignment (Figure 3 and Figure 4).

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
Historic maps dating between 1871–1958 were
reviewed to determine if there are any historic
age resources within the project area (Foster et
al. 2006). A 1958 topographic map depicts two
standing structures near the southern end of the
project area just south of an existing SAWS
facility. Subsequent aerial photography maps
indicate the structures were later destroyed.
Although none of the historic maps depict the
cemetery, maps from Wilson County dating to
1866 and 1879 and a Bexar County map dating
to 1887 indicate the cemetery is within the “J.S.
Shelly” or “J.S. Sheely” properties,
respectively. A review of the San Antonio
Stoner System Map Sheet 1119 depicts the
property as belonging to Susan Shely, although
no cemetery is shown. County records indicate
that J.S. Shely (Shelly in document) was issued
160 acres from the original David Oaks Survey
No. 1002 in 1859 (Bexar County Records Book
H2 Pages 139–140). The property remained in
the family and their descendants until the 1940s
as attested by the Stoner System Map.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive
archaeological survey with shovel testing of the
14-acre facility site, the 12-mile pipeline, and
three access roads on five separate field efforts
(Appendix A; Survey Results). Approximately
2.83 miles of the northern portion of the project
alignment was not intensively surveyed, based
on the recommendations of the previous
investigations and current site conditions
(Moreman and Feit 2002). One new
archaeological site, a prehistoric lithic scatter,

The 14-acre facility site is located south of
Hardy Road and east of the existing SAWS
water treatment plant. Vegetation in this area
consisted of short pasture grasses with
evidence of land clearing and agricultural
activities (Figure 5).

Figure 6.
Facing north, overview of
disturbances.
The APE for the injection pipeline is entirely
within open pasture areas with short grasses.
Disturbances observed within the project area
include vegetation clearing, stock ponds,
fences, two track roads, access roads, and
existing well pad sites (Figure 7). The ground
surface visibility ranged from 30 to 75 percent
with the surface exhibiting evidence of plowing
or land clearing activities.

Figure 5.
Facing east, overview of 14acre facility site.
Surface and subsurface disturbance is prevalent
throughout the APE from agricultural
activities, the excavation of stock ponds, and
the construction of access roads for well pads.
Vegetation is limited to short pasture grasses
throughout, with areas of high ground surface
visibility and surface exposures.
Northeast of the SAWS facility, the APE
traverses undeveloped ranch and agricultural
land. The project area includes areas of
disturbances
resulting
from
previous
agricultural activities, a pipeline corridor, and
the construction of adjacent wells, tanks,
ponds, and access roads (Figure 6). The ground
surface visibility was generally over 75 percent
and the surface exhibited evidence of plowing.

Figure 7.
Facing north, overview of
injection pipeline.

Vegetation consisted of short grasses and
mesquite trees. The ground surface visibility of
the northeastern most portion of the project was
primarily 100 percent with evidence of land
clearing activities. Four ephemeral upland
drainages intersect the project.

The access roads generally followed existing
two-track roads present within the property.
Portions of the access roads were altered by
grading and bulldozing activities and the

Overall, shovel tests were excavated to depths
ranging from 30–100 cmbs surface and
consisted of sand and sandy clay loam. Some
shovel tests terminated at basal clay. Twelve
shovel tests were excavated within the
proposed 14-acre facility site and 119 within
the proposed alignment. The THC’s survey
standards for projects of this size recommend
16 shovel tests per linear mile when the ROW
measures 100 feet wide and one shovel test per
2 acres for project areas 11–100 acres in size.
SWCA exceeded the number of shovel tests for
the 14-acre facility site, but prior disturbances
and surface visibility that consistently
exceeded 30 percent precluded shovel testing
in some areas of the alignments. Shovel testing
was significantly reduced in these areas,
specifically within the northeastern most
portion of the project. At the request of the
client, additional shovel tests were excavated in
areas outside of the proposed APE to determine
reroutes for planning purposes and possible
access roads. Numerous shovel tests were
excavated around the cemetery to determine
the best route option for the alignment and
injection pipeline.

installation of pipe culverts at drainage
crossings covered over with gravels. The
ground surface visibility within the access
roads ranged from 40 to 100 percent.
A total of 329 shovel tests were excavated, of
which 131 shovel tests were excavated within
the 12-mile project area and 14-acre facility
(Appendix B). Twenty-four shovel tests were
excavated within the access roads. One
hundred seventy-four are outside of the current
alignment due to subsequent reroutes and
changes. All but two were negative for cultural
material (Appendix B). One shovel test (WV21) contained a ceramic stoneware piece at 40
centimeters below surface (cmbs). The shovel
test was excavated within a cleared area
adjacent to an access road, tank, and stock
pond. The artifact was deemed an isolated find
based on the lack of additional positive shovel
tests in the vicinity and the severely disturbed
context of the area. With the subsequent
reroute, the shovel test is currently outside of
the APE. The other positive shovel test (AY26) was excavated near a proposed well site
and contained a possible chopper or hand tool
at 90 cmbs (Figure 8). The artifact was in very
sandy soils and the shovel test was terminated
at depth (100 cmbs). Additional shovel tests
excavated to delineate the positive shovel test
were negative for cultural materials. The
artifact was deemed an isolated find.

One of the main focuses of the survey was to
verify the location of the John Shock Shely
Cemetery (41BX1463) identified during the
background review. The review depicted three
different locations of the cemetery, including
one within the 14-acre facility. The results of
the survey, along with additional archival
research, pinned down the cemetery to one
location. The cemetery is listed as a Historic
Texas Cemetery and requires avoidance. The
cemetery is approximately 242 feet from the
alignment and 264 feet from the facility
location. SWCA recommends a 200-foot buffer
to avoid both the cemetery and potential
unmarked graves.
Site 41BX1963 was documented during the
investigations. As discussed below, the
prehistoric lithic scatter is recommended as not
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP.

41BX1963
Site 41BX1963 is located approximately 1 mile
northeast of Hardy Road and the existing
SAWS water treatment facility. The site is on
an upland, southwest trending slope
overlooking an ephemeral drainage to the west
(Figure 9). The surrounding vegetation consists
of yucca, acacia, prickly pear cacti, and sparse
grasses with gravel covering 20–30 percent of
the surface. Ground surface visibility ranged
from 60–90 percent. Erosion has deflated much
of the landform as well as previous
disturbances consisting of an existing pipeline
corridor that bisects the site, a property fence
line, and two-track roads.
The prehistoric lithic scatter was initially
discovered during the survey when a light
concentration of flakes was identified at the
juncture of the project area as it splits northwest
to southeast, near the existing pipeline corridor.
At this location, one lateral of the centerline
deviates towards the southeast, then north for
0.59 mile, whereas the centerline proceeds
northwest and north. A total of six shovel tests
were excavated within the site and all were
negative for cultural material (Table 1).
The soils are fairly shallow, consisting of
gravelly, brown-to–light-brown, sandy clay
loam and reddish brown clay. Cultural
materials were limited to the surface and
consisted of primarily debitage, flakes, and a
few formal tools dispersed across the site with
no discreet concentrations noted. In addition,
no fire-cracked rock or burned rock
concentrations was observed within the site
that indicate intact or remnant cooking or
heating features. The site measures
approximately 130 m east-west by 100 m
north-south, based on the extent of the surface
scatter and landform (Figure 10).

Figure 10.
Facing southeast, overview of
41BX1963 within pipeline corridor.
Artifacts encountered on the surface consisted
of approximately 100 flakes, two core
fragments, two biface fragments, one biface,
and one projectile point. Approximately 20
percent of the flakes were primary flakes with
more than 50 percent of cortex on the outer
surface; 20 percent were secondary flakes; and
60 percent were tertiary flakes with no cortex.
The projectile point is an unidentifiable dart
point with a long triangular blade, no
shoulders, and a broken base (Figure 11 and
Figure 12). The broken base appears to have
been modified by subsequent use. The blade is
long and slender, and the dart may be a Darl
point, which suggests a possible Archaic
component (Turner et al. 2011). Darl points are
long, slender points with an expanding or
rectangular stem (Turner el al. 2011).

Figure 11.
Site 41BX1963 dart point with
broken base, possibly Darl.

Given that the assemblage consists of a few
lithic tools and primarily late-stage tool
reduction flakes, the site likely represents a
brief occupation site. The evidence suggests
that available lithic raw materials were turned
into stone tools at the site and broken tools were
replaced. Except for the dart point, no distinct
diagnostic artifacts or intact features were
encountered.

pedestrian survey to verify the location of the
cemetery in relation to the proposed project
APE. The cemetery boundary is approximately
93 feet west from the proposed APE for the
pipeline and 300 feet east of the proposed 14acre facility. Although the Atlas depicts three
different locations for Cemetery No. BX-C189,
the results determined only one location is
accurate while the other two are misplottings of
the same resource.

41BX1963 SUMMARY
Site 41BX1963 clearly does not meet Criteria
A, B, or C of 36 CFR 60.4, but SWCA
evaluated the site for eligibility under Criterion
D, which considers its ability to yield
information important in prehistory or history.
Site 41BX1963 is a small, deflated prehistoric
lithic scatter. The site has been severely
impacted by land clearing activities related to a
pipeline corridor, fencing, and two-track roads.

During the investigations, SWCA encountered
only one cemetery location that consists of five
tombstones within a pipe fence measuring 161
feet by 122 feet (Figure 14). As noted in the
background review, the headstones include
those for J. S. Shely, his wife Susan Shely,
Raymond Lee Fleming, Minne Theadosia
Totty, and Dorothy Marie Shely. The
surrounding area consists of an open
agricultural field with short grasses and high
ground surface visibility. SWCA inspected the
ground surface surrounding the fence line and
the other locations of the cemetery as depicted
on Atlas determine its extent. The pipe fencing
was constructed sometime after 2008 by
SAWS based on aerial photography.

The artifact assemblage is sparse and dispersed
across the upland slope with no subsurface
deposits. The level of disturbances has
negatively impacted the integrity of the site,
eliminating the possibility of identifying
discrete activity areas. The lack of diagnostic
artifacts and features suggests the site is a small
prehistoric scatter and campsite, which is
typical of the region and contains little- to-no
research value.
The site lacks integrity, features, and the
potential for significant subsurface deposits.
Based on these factors, the site has limited
potential to yield information important to the
prehistory of the region. SWCA recommends
that 41BX1963 is not eligible for inclusion to
the NRHP. As such, no further work or
avoidance strategy is recommended for the site.

The cemetery was recorded as 41BX1463 in
2002 during the SAWS-ASR Transmission
Line project and documented east of the current
fenced in area on Atlas (2013). However, the
field maps in the report of investigations plots
the site within the current cemetery location
(Moreman and Feit 2002: Plate 1). Thus, the
Atlas plotting for 41BX1463 is incorrect and
does not reflect the actual location for the site.
In addition, the third location of the cemetery
shown within the 14-acre facility site and
designated as “Shelley-Fleming Cemetery” is
also incorrect.

JOHN SHOCK SHELY CEMETERY (41BX1463)
John Shock Shely Cemetery is a Historic Texas
Cemetery located within an agricultural field
about 1,100 feet south of Hardy Road, and
approximately 1,000 feet west of the existing
SAWS water treatment facility (Figure 13).
The cemetery was initially established in the
late 1870s as a family plot for the Shely family
It was subsequently recorded in 2002 during
the SAWS-Aquifer Storage Recharge
Transmission Line Project and was later
dedicated as Historic Texas Cemetery in 2008.
SWCA conducted archival research and a

Whereas no evidence was encountered that
they contributed significantly to the history of
the region further research is needed on the
Shely family. Although the location of the
cemetery was confirmed during the
investigations, the integrity of design, setting,
materials,
workmanship,
feeling,
and
association have been compromised due to the
severity of the disturbances and development
of the surrounding area. Further research is
needed on the Shely family to assess its
eligibility under Criterion B. Thus, the
cemetery’s eligibility for inclusion into the
NRHP or for SAL-nomination remains
undetermined.

Figure 14.
John Shock Shely Cemetery
(41BX1463), facing southeast.
The report date of this location was not
available on Atlas or the THC. SWCA
conducted shovel testing within the 14-acre
facility and no evidence of a cemetery,
tombstones, or depressions was encountered.
Historic aerials dating from 1938 to 1977 were
examined and they depict a faint outline of the
current cemetery boundary, are consistent
throughout the 40 years, and correlate with the
current fenced area (Figure 15).

The results of the field investigations and
additional archival research determined that the
fenced cemetery location is the most accurate.
Aerial photography also supports this location
and depicts an outline of a small, rectangular
feature within the same location of the
cemetery for almost 40 years. Although the
location of the cemetery has been determined,
the spatial extent of the burials remains unclear.
Research indicates that there are up to 45
additional unmarked burials that comprise the
cemetery. The current boundary is large and
may include the unknown burials; however,
without further investigation in the form of
scrapping, ground penetrating radar, and/or
magnetic resistivity, it cannot be determined
whether the burials are entirely contained
within the perimeter of the existing fence line.
SWCA established a 200-foot buffer around
the existing cemetery boundary as an
avoidance area to prevent the project from
disturbing any potential undocumented graves.

41BX1463 MANAGEMENT PLAN
The John Shock Shely Cemetery (41BX1463)
is a Historic Texas Cemetery ca. 1875–1927
located within SAWS property and within 93
feet of the proposed APE for the pipeline.
Typically, cemeteries are not considered for
listing on the NRHP and must meet special
requirements, called Criteria Considerations, in
addition to meeting one or more of the regular
requirements under Criteria A, B, C, and D of
36 CFR 60.4 and possessing integrity. The
cemetery has been severely affected by
agricultural development and, of the 50 graves
reported by local residents and a family
descendant, only five tombstones remain. The
cemetery represents a relatively small historicage family cemetery that is common
throughout the region in rural areas. The Shely
family was one of the first settlers of the area.

The current APE for the pipeline and 14-acre
facility avoids the cemetery boundary and 200foot buffer (Figure 16). No further work or
avoidance strategy is recommended for the
cemetery.

Several alignment changes and reroutes were
implemented through the duration of the
project. These were surveyed during four
separate field survey efforts. The initial
February 13, 2013, alignment was surveyed on
February 20–21, 2013. A subsequent February
26, 2013, alignment was surveyed in April 3–
5, 2013. The following report includes the
results of investigations of these alignments
and of the May 29, 2013 alignment and final
July 5, 2013 alignment, surveyed on June 12–
14, 2013, and August 12, 2013. The access
roads were surveyed on August 27–28, 2013.
The investigations consisted of an intensive
archaeological survey with shovel testing of the
proposed APE. All investigations were
conducted in accordance with THC and CTA
standards, as well as the guidelines provided in
Section 106 of the NHPA.

CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of B&V and SAWS, SWCA
conducted an intensive cultural resources
survey on Phase I of the SAWS Brackish
Groundwater Desalination Project. This report
includes the results of investigations of the
alignment as designed on July 5, 2013, as well
as the survey results for previous, nowabandoned alignments. The work was
conducted as part of the sponsor’s compliance
with the ACT (Permit Number 6445) and the
NHPA in anticipation of a Section 404
Nationwide Permit from the USACE-Fort
Worth District.
SAWS proposes to install a new water
production pipeline whose diameter would
vary from 12–36 inches, with associated
laterals and 13 production wells, a new
injection well pipeline with three injection
wells, 2.2 miles of access roads, and a new 14acre desalination facility. Installation of the
pipeline will require trenching and boring
within the 100-foot-wide construction
easement that is generally adjacent to existing
utility easements. The depth of disturbances
will be 5–10 feet deep throughout, while bore
pits will be 10–22 feet deep. The APE is a
construction easement that is approximately 12
miles long and 100 feet wide (159.5 acres),
including the 14-acre desalination facility. The
APE for the access roads is approximately 2.2
miles and 50 feet wide (13 acres). Vertical
disturbances will range in depth from 0–22 feet
deep.

During the archaeological survey, SWCA
archaeologists examined the entire 12 miles of
proposed APE and the 14-acre facility. Overall,
the intensive pedestrian survey revealed that
the proposed project area is within a rural
setting intersected by drive-ways, fence lines,
overhead utility lines, and existing
underground utilities. One of the main focuses
of the survey was to verify the location of the
John Shock Shely Cemetery (41BX1463),
identified during the background review. The
initial review depicted three different locations
of the cemetery with one within the 14-acre
facility. The results of the survey, along with
additional archival research, pinned down the
cemetery to one location outside of proposed
project impacts. In addition, one prehistoric site
(41BX1963) was newly documented within the
project area.

The investigations included a background
review and an intensive pedestrian survey with
shovel testing of the project area boundaries.
The background review determined that 2.83
miles of the project area had been previously
surveyed and that one cemetery is adjacent to
the APE. The historic map review determined
there are no historic-age properties within the
APE.

Site 41BX1963 is considered not eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP or designation as an
SAL, based the lack of cultural integrity,
research potential, and overall prior
disturbances. The eligibility status of the John
Shock Shely Cemetery is undetermined
pending further archival research into the Shely
26

family and surrounding area to evaluate the
cemetery under Criterion B. Currently, the
John Shock Shely Cemetery and the 200-foot
surrounding buffer is avoided by the proposed
pipeline alignment APE.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, SWCA has
made a reasonable and good faith effort to
identify cultural resource properties within the
APE. As no properties were identified that may
meet the criteria for listing in the NRHP
according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as
an SAL, according to 13 TAC 26.8, SWCA
recommends no further cultural resources work
within the project area.

ABSTRACT
On behalf of Black & Veatch Corporation and San Antonio Water Systems (SAWS), SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) conducted additional intensive cultural resources investigations on three alignment
changes for Phase I of the SAWS Brackish Groundwater Desalination Project. The addendum report
includes the results of survey investigations conducted on May 15, 2014. The work was conducted as part
of Black & Veatch’scompliance under the Antiquities Code of Texas Permit Number 6445 and the National
Historic Preservation Act in anticipation of a Section 404 Nationwide Permit from the USACE-Fort Worth
District.
SAWS proposed three alignment changes to install a new water production pipeline whose diameter would
vary from 12 to 36 inches, with associated laterals and production wells, and a new injection well pipeline
with associated injection wells. Installation of the pipeline will require trenching and boring within the 100foot construction easement that is generally adjacent to existing utility easements. The depth of disturbances
will be 5 to 10 feet deep throughout, while bore pits will be 10 to 22 feet deep. The area of potential effects
(APE) for the three alignment changes is 20 acres, with vertical disturbances ranging from 0 to 22 feet deep.
See full report (Acuña 2013) for overall proposed Brackish Water Desalination Project scope of work.
During the 2014 archaeological survey, SWCA archaeologists examined the entire 20 acres of APE.
Overall, shovel tests for the three additional alignment changes were excavated to depths ranging from 30
to 100 centimeters (cm) below ground surface within sand and sandy clay loam soils. Soil disturbances
from land clearing and agricultural plowing were observed in the first 20 cm of most shovel tests. Some
shovel tests were terminated at mottled basal clay, while others were terminated due to depth. The Texas
Historical Commission’s survey standards for projects of this size recommend one shovel test per 2 acres
for project areas 11 to 100 acres in size. SWCA met the number of required shovel tests for the 20-acre
APE by excavating a total of 10 shovel tests. None of the shovel tests yielded any cultural material, thus no
archaeological sites were recorded.
In accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good
faith effort to identify cultural resource properties within the APE. As no properties were identified that
may meet the criteria for listing in the National Register of Historic Places according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for
designation as a State Antiquities Landmark, according to 13 TAC 26.8, SWCA recommends no further
cultural resources work within the project area.

investigations were conducted in accordance with
the THC and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) standards, as well as the guidelines provided
in Section 106 of the NHPA. Laura I. Acuña served
as Principal Investigator. Acuña conducted the
survey with archaeologist Allyson Walsh on May
15, 2014.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Black & Veatch Corporation and San
Antonio Water Systems (SAWS), a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, SWCA
Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted
additional
intensive
cultural
resources
investigations for three alignment changes for the
proposed Phase I SAWS Brackish Groundwater
Desalination Project (hereafter, the Brackish Water
Desalination Project) (Figure 1). Located in
southeastern Bexar County, Texas, the project area
is approximately 4.2 miles southeast of the
Interstate Highway 37 (IH 37) and Loop 1604
intersection, and about 10 miles southwest of
Elmendorf, Texas. The work was conducted in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT) under Permit Number 6445. Additionally,
the project is subject to compliance with the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) in
anticipation of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) Forth Worth District, Section 404
Nationwide 12 permit in accordance with 33 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix
C (Processing Department of Army Permits:
Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties;
Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance
Documents dated April 25, 2005 and January 31,
2007).

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The proposed project will consist of a new water
production pipeline and new injection well pipeline
with production and injection wells. Details for the
overall project description and entire alignment
area of potential effects (APE) is detailed in Acuña
2013. The new alignment changes are located
specifically at Production Well 10, Injection Well
1, and Injection Well 2. The proposed alignment
pipeline will shift at each of the locations for a total
length of approximately 3,000 feet. The proposed
shifts include a 100 foot temporary workspace.
Thus, the APE consists of three alignment blocks
that total 20 acres with vertical disturbances
ranging from 0 to 22 feet deep.

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
An extensive cultural context and background
literature review was conducted for the entire
project area in Acuña 2013. A brief review of the
new alignment locations determined the cultural
context from the latter report has not changed.

In 2013 SWCA conducted initial investigations for
the proposed Brackish Water Desalination Project
water production pipeline, a new 14-acre
desalination facility, and a new injection well
pipeline and associated injection wells (Acuña
2013). Several alignment changes and reroutes
were implemented throughout the duration of the
project and were surveyed during four separate
field survey events (Acuña 2013). The results of the
2013 survey efforts were concurred with by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) in November
of 2013. In May 2014, three new alignment changes
were implemented for the Brackish Water
Desalination Project (Figure 2). The following
addendum includes the results of the May 2014
cultural resources investigations of the new
alignment changes.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
SWCA’s investigations consisted of an intensive
pedestrian survey with subsurface investigations
within the APE. Archaeologists examined the
ground surface, erosional profiles, and exposures
for cultural resources. Subsurface investigations
involved shovel testing in settings with the potential
to contain buried cultural materials.

The 2014 investigations consisted of an intensive
archaeological survey with shovel testing. All

distinction; or

Shovel tests were systematically excavated within
the APE. THC survey standards call for the
excavation of one shovel test per 2 acres for project
areas between 11 and 100 acres, or 10 shovel tests
for the 20-acre alignment changes. Shovel tests
were approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in
diameter and excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels to
1 m in depth or to culturally sterile deposits,
whichever came first. The matrix was screened
through ¼-inch mesh. The location of each shovel
test was plotted using a hand-held GPS receiver and
each test was recorded on appropriate project field
forms.

prehistory or history.

RESULTS
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
On May 15, 2014, two SWCA archaeologists
conducted an intensive pedestrian survey with
subsurface testing of the three alignment changes
for the Brackish Water Desalination Project. A total
of 10 shovel tests were excavated throughout the 20
acre APE, none of which were positive for cultural
material (Figure 3, Appendix A). No new
archaeological sites were recorded within the APE.

SWCA conducted a non-collection survey.
Artifacts, had any been encountered, would have
been tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the
field, but not collected.

SITE EVALUATIONS

Field investigations encountered a mostly rural
environment consisting of large-acre agricultural
fields and undeveloped parcels within much of the
APE. Three alignment blocks at Production Well
(PW) 10 to the north of Hardy Road, and Injection
Well (IW) 1 and IW 2 south of Hardy Road. The
three blocks consist of multiple segments and are
generally located on the southeastern side of the
overall Brackish Water Desalination Project area.

All newly documented archaeological sites were
evaluated according to the National Register
Criteria for Evaluation as codified in 36 CFR,
Chapter 60.4, which states:
The quality of significance in American
history,
architecture,
archeology,
engineering, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and
objects that possess integrity of location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, and association and

PRODUCTION WELL 10 (PW 10)
Alignment block PW 10 is composed of one large,
rectangular-shaped segment southwest of PW 10
and one small, irregular-shaped segment (Figure 4).
The two segments are located approximately 0.45
mile to the north of Hardy Road and are a southern
extension of the Phase I Production Centerline
alignment. The southwestern segment measures
approximately 80 m northeast to southwest by 130
m northwest to southeast, totaling approximately
2.6 acres. The northeastern segment measures
approximately 26.8 m northeast to southwest by
15.4 m northwest to southeast, totaling
approximately 0.11 acre.

overlaps a portion previously surveyed (Acuña
2013).

Vegetation of alignment block PW 10 consists of
low grasses and shrubs mixed with mesquite scrub
and a variety of cacti species (Figure 5). Ground
surface visibility for PW 10 is 40 to 60 percent.
Topography of PW 10 consists of an upland slope
with brown, sandy loam and sandy clay loam soils.
Two shovel tests were excavated within PW 10,
neither of which were positive for cultural
materials.

Vegetation of alignment block IW 1 consists of an
open pasture with low grasses and 60 to 100 percent
ground surface visibility (Figure 7). A 4-m wide
drainage channel transects the segment from
southwest to northeast. No well-defined channel
bed is present and no banks or edges characterize
the channel. The channel is identified by gently
sloping topography (4–6 percent) on either side of
the drainage channel, and a small portion of the
drainage that has been heavily eroded and
inundated from recent storm events (Figure 8). The
stream was likely channelized. Soils of alignment
block IW 1 are composed of brown sand over
mottled basal clay and sandy clay loam. The upper
levels of soil matrix are highly disturbed from land
clearing and agricultural plowing. Three shovel
tests were excavated within IW 1. No cultural
materials were identified during survey
investigation of IW 1.

INJECTION WELL 1 (IW 1)
Alignment block IW 1 consists of a single,
rectangular segment (Figure 6). IW 1 is located
approximately 0.37 mile southwest of Hardy Road
and is an extension of the Phase I Injection
Centerline alignment. The rectangular segment
measures approximately 169.6 m northeast to
southwest by 303.9 m northwest to southeast,
encompassing approximately 13.1 acres and

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Alignment block IW 2 is composed of three
segments arranged in an L-shaped block around a
previously surveyed area (Figure 9). IW 2 is located
approximately 0.86 mile southwest of Hardy Road,
and approximately 0.04 mile south and west of an
existing SAWS well facility (Figure 10). The
southeastern segment of alignment block IW 2 is a
rectangular shaped segment that measures
approximately 32.0 m northeast to southwest by
180.1 m northwest to southeast, encompassing
approximately 1.4 acres. The northeastern segment
of IW 2 is rectangular shaped with a hooked curve
between previously conducted survey areas. This
segment measures approximately 44.4 m northeast
to southwest by 143.1 m northwest to southeast,
totaling 0.77 acre in size. The northwestern
segment of IW 2 is an L-shaped segment that
measures 207.5 m northeast to southwest by 88.5 m
northwest to southeast, encompassing 2.6 acres.
The three segments cover approximately 4.77 acres
total.

On behalf of Black & Veatch Corporation and
SAWS, SWCA conducted an intensive cultural
resources investigation on three additional
alignment changes for Phase I of the SAWS
Brackish Groundwater Desalination Project. This
addendum report includes the survey results of
investigations conducted on May 15, 2014. The
work was conducted as part of the sponsor’s
compliance with the ACT (Permit Number 6445)
and the NHPA in anticipation of a Section 404
Nationwide Permit from the USACE-Fort Worth
District.
During the May 2014 archaeological survey,
SWCA archaeologists examined the entire 20-acre
APE. Overall, shovel tests for the three additional
alignment changes were excavated to depths
ranging from 30 to 100 cm below ground surface
within sand and sandy clay loam soils. Soil
disturbances from land clearing and agricultural
plowing were observed in the first 20 cm of most
shovel tests. Some shovel tests were terminated at
mottled basal clay, while others were terminated
due to depth. The THC survey standards for
projects of this size recommend one shovel test per
2 acres for project areas 11 to 100 acres in size.
SWCA met the number of required shovel tests for
the 20-acre APE by excavating a total of 10 shovel
tests. None of the shovel tests yielded any cultural
material, thus no archaeological sites were
recorded.

The vegetation of alignment block IW 2 consists of
an open field of low grasses and 20 to 40 percent
ground surface visibility (Figure 11). Topography
of the alignment block consists of a gently sloping
(<5 percent) upland prairie. Soils of IW 2 consist of
brown sands with heavy disturbances from land
clearing and agricultural plowing. A total of five
shovel tests were excavated within alignment block
IW 2, none of which contained cultural material.
Overall, shovel tests for the three additional
alignment changes were excavated to depths
ranging from 30 to 100 cm below ground surface
and consisted of sand and sandy clay loam soils.
Soil disturbances from land clearing and
agricultural plowing were observed in the first 20
cm of most shovel tests. Some shovel tests were
terminated at mottled basal clay, while others were
terminated due to depth. The THC survey standards
for projects of this size recommend one shovel test
per 2 acres for project areas 11 to 100 acres in size.
SWCA met the number of required shovel tests for
the 20-acre APE by excavating a total of 10 shovel
tests. None of the shovel tests yielded any cultural
material, thus no archaeological sites were
recorded.

In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, SWCA has made
a reasonable and good faith effort to identify
cultural resource properties within the APE. As no
properties were identified that may meet the criteria
for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation
as a State Antiquities Landmark, according to 13
TAC 26.8, SWCA recommends no further cultural
resources work within the project area.
