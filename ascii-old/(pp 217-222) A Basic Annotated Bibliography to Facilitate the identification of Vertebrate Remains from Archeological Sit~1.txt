A Basic Annotated Bibliography to
Facilitate the Identification of
Vertebrate Remains from
Archeological Sites
STANLEY J.

OLSEN

VERTEBRATE paleontologists and mammalogists have at hand
various standard reference works that relate to the skeletons of the
animals with which they are concerned. After using these works for
many years they become as familiar to the specialist as his dictionary
or word guide, and it is difficult for him to realize that many of these
publications are not known to the archaeological field worker or to
others who might benefit from their use. It is with this thought in
mind that the following brief bibliography was compiled. Although
by no means complete in itself, many of the references contain bibliographies of their own which can be pursued further if so desired.
MOST

A bibliography of this sort, in order to be of real value, must be
made practical by listing publications that are available to the average
worker rather than listing many papers that would be obtainable only
by those few people who occupy laboratories near a more or less complete library. No attempt has been made to include old works that are
not available outside of large university libraries or to cite those publications that are confined to the non-loan reference sections and hence
of little value to the research worker who has need of the volume in
his workroom where the comparative osteological material is housed.
Flowerâ€™s An Introduction to the Osteology of the Marnmalia (1876)
would fall into this last category, except for the current reprinting of
this old standard handbook (Dover Publications, New York, in press),
which now places it within the reach of all who would like to own it.
It is hoped that in the not too distant future other "rare" reference
volumes will become available due to modern methods of reprinting
at a low cost.

Many of our common animals have not been described adequately
in regard to their skeletons. However, a book which covers the osteology of the domestic dog can, of course, be used to separate all canids
from other similar unrelated forms. This group in turn can be isolated
still further into finer groupings by referring to publications (where
available) that key out features of the dentitions or skeletons which
are peculiar, say, to the fox, wolf, dog, etc. This same observation
applies to a well-illustrated anatomical text which covers the domestic
cat, which in tur.n can be used to separate the felids from other nonrelated forms.
The writer is at present working on a field and laboratory manual
for the identification of mammal remains from archaeological sites.
The first part of this work will cover those sites that are found in the
southeastern and southwestern United States. At least sixty-four mammals will be treated in this contribution, with the bones of the postcranial skeleton as well as the skulls being illustrated, described, and
compared. The drawings will be keyed with arrows or dashed lines to
indicate differentiating characters. No date has been set for the completion of this project, but it is hoped that publication will be in the
not too distant future.
