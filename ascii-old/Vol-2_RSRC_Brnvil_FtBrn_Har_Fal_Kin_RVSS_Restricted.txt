ABSTRACT
Gulf South Research Corporation (GSRC) personnel conducted intensive pedestrian
archaeological surveys for the Border Patrol Facilities and Tactical Infrastructure (BPFTI)
Program Management Office (PMO), within Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) U.S.
Customs and Border Protection (CBP), at 56 proposed primary and alternate new tower sites for
the proposed upgrade of its Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) program within the U.S.
Border Patrol’s (USBP) Harlingen (HRL), Brownsville (BRP), Fort Brown (FTB), Falfurrias
(FLF), and Kingsville (KIN) Stations’ Areas of Responsibility (AORs). It should be noted that
some of the tower locations include multiple tower footprints that were relocated after the initial
surveys were conducted. BPFTI is conducting the investigations on behalf of USBP
Headquarters. The area of potential effect (APE) for the archaeological surveys included all areas
of ground disturbance for the construction of the proposed primary and alternate tower sites
including access roads, utility corridors, and the tower footprint itself. The surveys were
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7564. A total of two archaeological sites
(41CF228 amd 41CF229) were recorded during the archaeological surveys conducted at the
proposed primary and alternate tower sites. Both of the archaeological sites are recommended
not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and no additional
archaeological work is recommended for those sites.
GSRC personnel also assessed the potential visual impacts on properties either listed or eligible
for listing in the NRHP. Potential adverse visual effects would occur on two NRHP-listed
historic districts (Palmito Ranch Battlefield and King Ranch). Both of the NRHP-listed historic
districts are National Historic Landmarks (NHLs). Additional consultation with the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), and possibly the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation,
would be required in order to mitigate the potential adverse effects on these historic properties if
adverse effects can not be avoided. One cemetery recorded in the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas is mapped as overlapping with one of the tower site locations. While no graves were
observed within the tower footprint or its associated access and utility corridor, testing should be
done within both the tower site and the associated access and utility corridor to determine if
unmarked graves extend into their footprints. In addition, the tower, given its proximity, would
be an adverse visual effect on the cemetery. No potential adverse visual effects were noted for
any of the other known historic resources present within the visual APEs of the tower sites.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
GSRC personnel conducted intensive pedestrian archaeological surveys at 56 proposed primary
and alternate tower sites for the RVSS Upgrade Project. These surveys were conducted during
six field sessions between July 27, 2015, and June 30, 2016, under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 7564. The surveys were conducted for CBP under contract to BPFTI PMO, within DHS
under Contract Number HSBP1014F00337G. The proposed undertaking is the upgrade of
CBP’s RVSS program within the USBP HRL, BRP, FTB, FLF, and KIN Stations’ AORs.
A total of two archaeological sites (41CF228 and 41CF229) were recorded during the
archaeological surveys conducted for the RVSS Upgrade Project. Both of the archaeological
sites are recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP and no additional archaeological
work is recommended for those sites.
GSRC personnel also assessed the potential visual impacts on properties either listed or eligible
for listing in the NRHP. Potential adverse visual effects would occur on two NRHP-listed
historic districts (Palmito Ranch Battlefield and King Ranch). Both of the NRHP-listed historic
districts are NHLs. Additional consultation with the THC, and possibly the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation, would be required in order to mitigate the potential adverse effects on
these historic properties if adverse effects can not be avoided. One cemetery recorded in the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas is mapped as overlapping with one of the tower site locations.
While no graves were observed within the tower footprint or its associated access and utility
corridor, testing should be done within both the tower site and the associated access and utility
corridor to determine if unmarked graves extend into their footprints. In addition, the tower,
given its proximity, would be an adverse visual effect on the cemetery. No potential adverse
visual effects were noted for any of the other known historic resources present within the visual
APEs of the tower sites.
Section 1 of this report provides a general introduction of the project and Section 2 provides an
environmental background of the project including the soils, geology, vegetation, fauna, and
paleoenvironment of each proposed collocation or new tower location. Section 3 provides a
cultural overview of the project area, including a brief cultural history of the South Texas and
Coastal Bend regions. Section 4 outlines the survey methods used during the field investigation
of the project and Section 5 outlines the previous investigations and previously recorded cultural
resources in the vicinity of the collocation and new tower sites. Section 6 outlines the results of
the surveys. Section 7 summarizes the findings of the cultural resources surveys and
recommendations for the identified cultural resources. Section 8 provides the references cited in
this report. Appendix A contains the figures with restricted cultural resource location
information. Appendix B contains photographs.

INTRODUCTION

The Border Patrol Facilities and Tactical Infrastructure (BPFTI) Program Management Office
(PMO), within Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection
(CBP), is conducting consultation with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) in accordance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended, to
address the potential effects from the upgrade of its Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS)
program within the U.S. Border Patrol’s (USBP) Harlingen (HRL), Brownsville (BRP), Fort
Brown (FTB), Falfurrias (FLF), and Kingsville (KIN) Stations’ Areas of Responsibility (AORs)
(Figure 1-1). BPFTI is preparing an Environmental Assessment (EA) on behalf of the USBP
Headquarters.
USBP is the mobile uniformed law enforcement subcomponent of CBP responsible for patrolling
and securing America’s border between the Ports of Entry. As directed by DHS Analysis of
Alternatives (AoA), CBP is investing in the USBP border security technology plan for the Rio
Grande Valley (RGV) Sector. Accordingly, the new plan incorporates both the quantitative
analysis of science and engineering experts and the real-world operational assessment of USBP
on the ground (DHS 2011). This plan includes the utilization of RVSS to provide long-range,
persistent surveillance, enabling USBP personnel to detect, track, identify, and classify illegal
entries through a series of integrated sensors and tower-based surveillance equipment.
Technology considered in the project includes sensors and other surveillance assets, as well as
communications and Command and Control (C2) systems along the border. This technology
would communicate with the HRL, BRP, FTB, FLF, and KIN Stations’ C2 facilities and would
provide an overall network system of communications and surveillance within each of the
stations’ AORs. Infrastructure to be considered within USBP’s plan includes roadways to and
from RVSS towers, as well as support utilities. Meeting this purpose would provide more
efficient and effective interdiction while reducing the potential for adverse impacts from illegal
cross-border activities on the natural and cultural environments in the HRL, BRP, FTB, FLF, and
KIN Stations’ AORs.
The undertaking would provide long-range persistent surveillance capability and was identified
in the new border security technology plan as the most effective technology-based solution for
HRL, BRP, FTB, FLF, and KIN Stations’ AORs. The upgrade of the RVSS program is expected
to allow Border Patrol Agents (BPAs) to spend less time locating illegal entries and focus efforts
on interdiction of those involved in illegal cross-border activities, thereby enhancing rapid
response capability through a dynamic enforcement posture.
The undertaking includes the construction, operation, and maintenance of a sufficient amount of
new RVSS towers for improved border surveillance coverage throughout the HRL, BRP, FTB,
FLF, and KIN Stations’ AORs. CBP is currently analyzing 56 potential new field sensor tower
locations within the various AORs for use within the RVSS upgrade project (Table 1; Figures 12 through 1-33). There would be a total of 12 new RVSS towers and associated infrastructure in
the HRL AOR, five in the BRP AOR, nine in the FTB AOR, four in the FLF AOR, and two in
the KIN AOR. These towers are located on Federal, private, and state lands. The current
selected preferred RVSS towers are indicated in Table 1 with an asterisk.

Three types of tower structures are included as part of the Proposed Action: self-standing towers
(SSTs), monopole towers, and relocatable towers. Only the relocatable towers would require
guy wires. SSTs are steel, lattice-style structures with a base of three circular concrete piers,
each approximately 4 to 6 ft in diameter. Other foundation types may be used depending on the
site-specific geotechnical characteristics. The depth of the pilings is dependent on tower height
and geotechnical characteristics at each tower site, but would be expected to be less than 60 ft
below ground surface (bgs). SSTs could be up to 199 ft high including lightning protection.
Monopole towers are metal, single-pole towers with reinforced steel and concrete foundations.
The depth of each tower foundation is dependent on tower height and geotechnical
characteristics at each tower site but is expected to range from 10 to 60 ft bgs. Monopole towers
generally range in height from 60 to 140 ft but could be up to 199 ft high.
Relocatable towers are towed in place on a trailer and placed on a level ground. The guy wires
will attach to the relocatable tower trailer outrigger infrastructure to stabilize the tower when
extended. If necessary, the guy wires can attach to concrete barriers or other anchors to increase
the tower stability, as required. When fully extended these towers can reach a height of up to
120 ft. Each tower would have the design, power requirements, and site and fence enclosure
footprint described below, unless otherwise noted in the detailed proposed tower site discussions.
Figure 1-34 shows the typical elements and the usual layout of those elements associated with an
RVSS tower, regardless of the type of tower. Construction of SSTs or monopole tower sites
result in ground disturbance confined to a 200- x 200-foot (ft) area (40,000 square ft). All
staging of construction equipment and materials occurs within this footprint during construction,
as necessary. Each permanent tower site footprint is expected to be up to a 100- x 100-ft (10,000
square ft) polygon, depending on site-specific conditions for both tower types, and includes a
permanent parking area for vehicles. Each tower footprint is confined to the dimensions
mentioned above. Regardless of each tower site’s configuration, the total area of temporary
construction disturbance for each site does not exceed 30,000 square ft, and the total area of
permanent disturbance does not exceed 10,000 square ft. The 30,000-square-ft temporary
construction area and 10,000-square-ft tower site footprint are included in the 40,000-square-ft
survey area for each tower site.
Access drive construction and access road maintenance and repairs are required to move
construction equipment, materials, and personnel to and from the proposed tower sites during
construction. Access drive construction is required to connect established public or private
access roads to the proposed tower sites. Access drives would be constructed to provide access
to RVSS sites from established public or private roads. The access drives would be constructed
to provide a 12-ft-wide driving surface with 2-ft shoulders on each side. The total width of new
access drives would be 16 ft. Access drives would be constructed by mechanically removing
vegetation and grading native soils. Following construction activities, any temporary impact
areas would be revegetated with a mixture of nursery plantings or native plant seeds (or both), as
described previously.

Road maintenance and repairs would include reconstruction, widening, or straightening of the
existing road, and installation of drainage structures, which would require either a 30-ft-wide or a
60-ft-wide temporary construction disturbance area. Drainage structures may include, but are
not limited to, ditches, culverts, and low-water crossings.
The access roads would be maintained and repaired to the design standard for FC-3 GradedEarth Road. All access roads would have a driving surface of 12 ft with a 2-ft shoulder on either
side (16 ft total), along with improvements such as ditches, low-water crossings, turnouts, and
necessary erosion protection (i.e., riprap and gabion headwalls).
Cultural resources surveys were conducted for all 56 of the proposed primary, alternate, and
tertiary option location sites, though only 32 would be chosen for construction. The surveys
were conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7564 for eleven of the proposed tower
locations located on land owned by the State of Texas as well as land owned by subdivisions of
the state including land owned by the Cameron County and land owned by the City of
Brownsville (see Table 1-1). Texas Antiquities Permits were obtained for the properties
included on land owned by Cameron County including lands owned by the Hidalgo and
Cameron County Irrigation District Number 9, the Cameron County Water Irrigation District
Number 2, the Feria Water Control and Improvement District Number 3, and Cameron County
itself. Two of the entities, The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and the City of
Brownsville indicated that Texas Antiquities Permits would not be required for the survey of the
properties that they owned and did not sign the permits submitted to them. Permissions to
conduct the surveys were obtained through correspondence between the Federal sponsor of the
project (CBP) and those entities and were provided to the THC. Despite TxDOT stating that a
Texas Antiquities Permit would not be required to survey lands owned by their agency, a
completed signed permit application was received from the local TxDOT representative at
Raymondville for the KIN Juanita Section of Kenedy Ranch Alternate. Mr. John Lindemuth, Dr.
Bretton Somers, Ms. Jenni Bivona, and Mr. Brian Thibodeaux conducted the archaeological
surveys. Ms. Erin Edwards and Ms. Alexis Thomas conducted the survey of the
aboveground/architectural historic resources. Ms. Sharon Newman and Ms. Liz Ayarbe-Perez
conducted the GIS analysis and produced the maps for the report. Ms. Maria Vidrine helped
with data entry and compiled and formatted Appendix B, which includes all the photographs.

2.1.1 Geologic Unit Descriptions
2.1.1.1 Alluvium deposits (Qal, Qas, Qac)
This geologic unit consists of alluvium and low terrace deposits of Holocene age along streams.
The deposits consist of sand, silt, clay, and gravel. General alluvium deposits (Qal) also include
areas along the lower course of the Rio Grande River that are divided into areas that are
predominantly mud (Qam), silt and sand (Qas), and clay (Qac) (Barnes 1976).
2.1.1.2 Clay dunes (Qcd)
Clay dunes are comprised of dune clay and silt that is light-gray, brown, and brownish gray
calcareous silty clay to clayey silt with very fine quartz sand. Accumulations of fine to very fine
quartz sand and sand sized aggregates of silt and clay which are deflated from saline flats. The
geologic unit is called “clay dunes” because they are unusually clayey but subsequent laboratory
analyses show them to be a sand-clay. Buried soils are common within this geologic unit and
locally deposits contain ostracods and laminae of clam shell fragments (Moore and Wermund
1993).
2.1.1.3 Sand sheet deposits (Qs)
Sand sheet deposits consist of windblown sands and areas of large Quaternary-age dunes that are
mapped on the Van Horn-El Paso sheet of the geologic map of Texas. The unit has no relict
grain and sparse grass. The unit has high permeability with low to moderate water holding
capacity and a shallow water table.

2.1.1.4 Dune sand sheet deposits (Qsd)
Dune sand sheet deposits are stabilized sand dune deposits that have been mapped on the Van
Horn-El Paso, Corpus Christi, and McAllen-Brownsville sheets of the geologic map of Texas.
The unit is Quaternary in age and consists of strong relict eolian grain. The unit includes active
blowouts with depressed relief and the surface is hummocky. The deposits have a moderate to
very high permeability with low to moderate water-holding capacity (Barnes 1976).
2.1.1.5 Goliad Formation (Mg)
Goliad Formation (Mg) includes clay, sandstone, marl, caliche, limestone, and conglomerate of
Miocene age (Barnes 1976).
2.2

FLORA AND FAUNA

The existing collocation and proposed new tower sites are located within the Gulf Coast Prairies
and Marshes and South Texas Brush Country Ecoregions of Texas (Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department [TWPD] 2011). Vegetation commonly found in the South Texas Brush Country
Ecoregion includes honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), blackbrush (Acacia rigidula), brasil
(Condalia hookeri), lantana (Lantana spp.), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), and sideoats gramma
grass (Bouteloua curtipendula). Wildlife commonly found includes Texas horned lizard
(Phrynosoma cornutum), Great Plains rat snake (Elaphe guttata emoryi), collared peccary
(Tayassu tajacu), coyote (Canis latrans), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), black
vulture (Coragyps atratus), Harris’s hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus), and red-tailed hawk (Buteo
jamaicensis).
2.3

PALEOENVIRONMENT

At the terminal Pleistocene, the south Texas environment is thought to have been like parkland,
with both grassland and forest elements. Large megafauna, such as mammoth and mastodon, as
well as other extinct animal species, were present. Leading into the Holocene, the climate is
thought to have been one of gradually increasing aridity. Temperatures during the early
Holocene were similar to those today, with water more abundant and vegetation more open. The
uplands were probably more open but with groves of mesquite and other trees, while along the
streams there were concentrations of woody vegetation, as well as occasional mesquite thickets
(Hester 1980). Wood species identified in hearth charcoal indicate that mesquite was clearly
present in riverine zones as early as 6000 years Before Present [B.P.] (Hester 2004). The
mesquite and thorny shrubs began to dominate the south Texas countryside within the historic
period. Animals available to prehistoric Native Americans in south Texas included bison,
pronghorn antelope, bear, and prairie chicken. Other animals that are available today that were
not available to prehistoric populations include the armadillo and the javelina (peccary), the latter
first appearing circa (ca) Anno Domini (A.D.) 1400 (Hester 1980, 2004).

CULTURAL SETTING

3.1

PREHISTORIC OVERVIEW

The proposed primary and alternate tower location sites are distributed across the south Texas
archaeological region. The prehistoric cultural chronology of the south Texas archaeological
region is split into six broad periods: Paleoindian, Early Archaic, Middle Archaic, Late Archaic,
Late Prehistoric, and Protohistoric (Pertula 2004).
3.1.1 Paleoindian Period
The waning of the continental ice sheets at the end of the Pleistocene around 11,000 years B.P.
was when the first evidence of the Paleoindians in the south Texas area appeared. Their culture
would last until 8000 B.P. These first people relied upon a hunting and gathering subsistence
and moved as nomadic bands as the seasons changed, following the availability of edible
vegetation and game animals in the region. Archaeological sites have provided the remains of
multiple animals, including a broad range of fish, horse, bison, rabbit, turtle, lizard, ducks, rats,
and other species that the Paleoindian people used for subsistence resources. Evidence suggests
that the Paleoindian population was sparsely distributed throughout the region, forming small
groups that moved frequently across large areas (Black 1989; Hester 1989, 2004).
The primary classification for dates and occupational periods of the Paleoindian cultural
chronology is based on projectile point technology. Archaeological sites in the region for this
period vary from early Paleoindian terrestrial sites to eroded late Paleoindian artifacts found on
the surface mixed with later Archaic period artifacts. Some of the lithic artifacts recovered are
the Folsom, Clovis, Golondrina, Barber, and Angostura projectile points that range in complexity
from early fluted forms to stemmed points by the end of the cultural period. The late Paleoindian
tools and the early archaic tools become harder to differentiate as lifestyles drift toward the
beginning of the Archaic period (Black 1989; Hester 1989; 2004).
3.1.2 Early Archaic
Archaeological evidence of the Early Archaic period (8000 to 4500 years B.P.) suggests a
considerable increase of human population and a change to a dryer and warmer climate when
compared to the Paleoindian period. Hunting and gathering continued to be the way of life,
although the designs of flint knapping changed significantly. The new distinctive artifact styles
found in archaeological sites include two unifacial varieties of Clear Fork and Guadalupe tools,
notched net sinker or bola stones; Gower stemmed points; Early Corner-Notched, Early
Expanding-Stem (Bandy, Martindale, Uvalde, and related forms), and Early Triangular dart
points; and large-barbed Bell projectile points. Hester (2004) has subsequently defined two
horizons that make up the early Archaic, the Early Basal-Notched horizon followed by the early
Corner-Notched horizon. From typological cross-dating of projectile point forms, the temporal
span of the Early Corner-Notched horizon extends from ca 8000 to 5500 B.P. In south Texas the
Early Corner-Notched horizon is typified by corner-notched dart points with recurved or notched
bases. These forms fit within the Martindale-Uvalde-Baker-Bandy continuum and, to a lesser
extent, some specimens of the Gower type. Also associated with the Early Corner-Notched
horizon are Guadalupe tools. The subsequent Early Basal-Notched horizon extends from
ca 5500 B.P. to 2500 B.P. This horizon is typified by dart points with deep basal notches, large

barbs, and distinctive long stems. Recognized types of this horizon include the Bell and Andice
types and possibly Early Triangular bifaces, which may first appear in the Early Corner-Notched
horizon and extend into this later horizon. Other recognizable traits of this horizon include large
unifacial Clear Fork tools, as well as smaller forms and multinotched “eccentric” Bell/Andice
specimens (Hester 2004). Specialized cooking apparatuses which used fired stone as heating
elements began during this period, reflecting the sophistication of the culture’s adaption to
subsistence techniques in the region and (Black 1989; Hester 1980). Little or nothing is known
about the settlement patterns of the Early Archaic in south Texas.
3.1.3 Middle Archaic
The artifact assemblages of the Middle Archaic period (4500 to 2400 years B.P.), are dominated
by Triangular dart points, known as Tortugas and Abasolo, along with regionally specific types
such as the Carrizo (Black 1989; Hester 2004). These newer designs can be used as knives or as
tips on darts, spears, or lances, possibly for hunting bison that migrated into the region during the
early part of the period. In the northern portion of the south Texas region, Middle Archaic sites
are often identified by the presence of stemmed points that can be cross-dated with projectile
points from central Texas (Pedernales and Lange), the Lower Pecos (Langtry), and the central
coastal plain (Morhiss). Utilitarian lithic tools associated with this period include smaller
unifacial and bifacial distally-beveled tools (Hester 2004). There is evidence of repeated
reworking and resharpening of these tools. Hester (2004) suggests that these tools may have
been used primarily for woodworking. Ground stone artifacts, such as tubular stone pipes,
grinding slabs, and manos, are common at Middle Archaic sites, as well as in later contexts
(Black 1989).
The subsistence data available, particularly from the Choke Canyon Reservoir area, suggests that
plant resources were heavily utilized during this period. This is reflected an increase of formal
hearths, earth ovens, and burned rock accumulations. Data recovered at Choke Canyon from
charcoal foral analysis suggest the utilization of beans and nuts of mesquite, acacia, oak, and
hackberry (Hester 2004). Faunal resources include land snails, freshwater mussels, deer, and
other mammals (Black 1989).
Data on settlement patterns from study areas such as Choke Canyon, Caparrosa, and East
Chacon, suggest that Middle Archaic open camp sites are found predominantly along present or
relict stream channels, with sites in the later part of the Middle Archaic being located on
floodplains, low terraces, and natural levees of present stream courses. Burial practices during
this period involved interment in cemeteries such as Loma Sandia. By the later Middle Archaic
period, climatic evidence suggests that the environment shifted to one of the driest environments
ever experienced in the region.
3.1.4 Late Archaic
Climate during the Late Archaic period (2400 B.P. to A.D. 600/700) slowly changed to a moister
environment with some of the vegetation from the arid period remaining in the western reaches
of Texas. Artifacts recovered from Late Archaic sites within the south Texas plains consist of
small, corner- or side-notched dart points including Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Fairland, Shumla,
Montell, and Ellis varieties. Other artifacts noted during this period include small triangular
gouge-like tools with specialized resharpening techniques called Olmos bifaces, which may have

also continued to be used into the Late Prehistoric period (Hester 2004). Small distally-beveled
tools, such as Nueces scrapers, as well as limited numbers of corner tang bifaces, are also present
in Late Archaic contexts (Black 1989). Additionally, Late Archaic sites have extensive deposits
of fire-cracked rock (FCR), including both hearth and earth ovens, as well as grinding
implements such as manos and metates.
Subsistence data coupled with the extensive deposits of FCR and grinding implements noted
above, suggest a further intensification of the exploitation of mesquite and acacia beans, as well
as other plant resources. Faunal data from the Late Archaic contexts show the exploitation of
small animals, such as rodents, rabbits, turtles, fish, lizards, snakes, and deer. Rabdotus snails
and mussels also continue to be common food sources.
Population density continued to rise during the Late Archaic, and camp sites, similar to thos in
the later part of the Middle Archaic, were positioned adjacent to present stream channels or
sloughs. Cemeteries continued to be used during this period. There is evidence of regional trade
occurring during this period, particularly in central Texas (Black 1989; Hester 1980, 2004).
3.1.5 Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric
During the Late Prehistoric Period (A.D. 800 to A.D. 1600). small, expanding stem dart points of
the Late Archaic were replaced with smaller, expanding stem arrow points. The differences in
typology are difficult to discern in the early portion of the Late Prehistoric period. Hester (2004)
provides an example in which Middle Archaic type “dart points,” such as Ensor, Matamoros,
Catan, and Zavala, often occur in contexts that are Late Prehistoric. A distinctive artifact that
does appear during this period is the arrow shaft straightener or spokeshave. This artifact is
usually made of limestone and is often broken from repeated reheating during the arrowstraightening process (Hester 2004).
The Late Prehistoric can be divided into two time periods termed the Austin (A.D. 800 to A.D.
1350) and Toyah horizons (after A.D. 1250/1300) (Black 1989; Hester 2004). The Toyah
horizon is the best documented Later Prehistoric pattern in the South Texas region. Cultural
traits noted for Toyah sites included Perdiz points, small end scrapers, flake knives, beveled
knives, bone-tempered pottery, perforators made on flakes, ceramic figurines, pipes, marine shell
and freshwater mussel shell ornaments, tubular bird bone beads, and spatulate objects made on
bison bone fragments (Hester 2004). Faunal material recovered from Toyah sites includes
abundant bison bone, though white-tailed deer may have been more extensively hunted, along
with pronghorn and a variety of smaller game. Turtles, freshwater mussels, and land snails also
continue to be part of the diet. Sites, as with previous periods, are located along present stream
channels or nearby sloughs, often buried under the surface of natural levees. The later part of the
Late Prehistoric period, which includes the Toyah horizon, also shows evidence of south Texas
connections to a north-south Plains trade network (Hester 2004).
By the early nineteenth century, the native peoples of the area were either culturally or
biologically extinct or displaced. As a result, the information on the Native American
populations of the area is derived predominantly from historic documents from Spanish
expeditions and missionaries, and the earliest Anglo-European explorers and settlers. The
Coastal Bend subarea was inhabited by several different groups of Native Americans including

the Coahuiltecans, Karankawas, Lipan Apaches, and Tonkawas. These groups were subdivided
into numerous smaller bands including the Atakapa, Borado, Cavas, Capoque, Emet, Kohani,
Kopani, Malaquite, Payata, and Sana Tamique, among others (Hester 1989; Newcombe 2002).
3.2

HISTORIC OVERVIEW

The historic chronology of the South Texas region can be divided into five temporal periods
Spanish Exploration (A.D. 1535 to 1659), Spanish Colonial (A.D. 1659 to 1821), Mexican
Colonial (A.D. 1821 to 1836), Texas Republic and Nineteenth Century American (A.D. 1836 to
1900), and Twentieth Century American (A.D. 1900 to present). These historic periods are
defined by distinct artifact assemblages along with historic archival and documentary evidence.
A brief overview of these periods is presented below.
3.2.1 Spanish Exploration Period
The Spanish Exploration period began with the presence of European explorers, mostly of
Spanish descent, in the Coastal Bend region. The first Europeans thought to enter the area were
Alvar Nuñez, better known as Cabeza de Vaca, along with three companions (Sánchez 1992).
The Panfilo de Narváez expedition, of which Cabeza de Vaca was a member, was shipwrecked
on the upper Texas coast, at a location they described as the Isla del Malhado (Sánchez 1992;
Hester 1999). The Isla del Malhado was probably Galveston Island or a nearby island, given the
known ethnohistoric and archaeological record (Hester 1999). Historians, anthropologists, and
archaeologists disagree as to the route taken by Cabeza de Vaca’s group across Texas. The
Krieger route posits that Cabeza de Vaca travelec from the upper and central Texas coast,
through southern Texas, into northeastern Mexico, and perhaps back into west Texas. This is the
most probable of all the routes proposed, given the archaeological and ethnohistoric record
(Hester 1999). By 1535, Cabeza de Vaca and his three companions crossed southern Texas,
reaching different points along the Rio Grande (Sánchez 1992).
3.2.2 The Spanish Colonial Period
No real attempts to settle the area were made until the late seventeenth century, in response to a
French settlement established by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle on the Texas coast in
1685. Based on the Spanish’s unsuccessful attempt at establishing missions in east Texas during
the latter part of the seventeenth century, the Spanish decided that a three-pronged approach
including the mission, presidio, and civilian settlement, would be the best strategy to establish a
Spanish presence in the area. The Corpus Christi Bay remained unexplored until 1747, when
Joaquín Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra led an expedition down the Nueces River to its mouth.
After several failed attempts, the first settlement in the area was founded by Blas María de la
Garza Falcòn in 1766. He established a ranch called Santa Petronila on Petronila Creek. Despite
many ranchers from the RGV applying for and receiving land grants in the lower Nueces Valley
during the end of the eighteenth century, the area was slow to develop. By 1794, a large ranch
belonging to Juan Barrera, known as Rancho de Santa Gertrudis, was established on the north
side of Corpus Christi Bay. An Native American uprising in 1812 forced many of the colonists
to seek refuge in the RGV. Hostilities with the Comanches and Lipans in the area continued
until the end of Spanish Control of the region (Long 2010; Fox 1989).

3.2.3 Mexican Colonial Period
With Mexican independence in 1821, the region became part of Tamaulipas. Remaining land in
the area was deeded to individuals by the Tamaulipan government. After several unsuccessful
attempts to establish settlements in the area, Fort Lipantitlán was established in 1831 where the
road from Matamoros to Goliad crossed the river. Both Irish and German settlers also moved
into the area during the 1820s and 1830s (Long 2010; Fox 1989).
3.2.4 Texas Republic and Nineteenth Century American Period
The Texas Republic period began in 1836 after the Texas Revolution. During this time the
region became a no man’s land with both Mexican and Texan merchants engaging in illegal
trading within the Nueces valley. Henry Lawrence Kinney established a trading post and fort on
Corpus Christi Bay in 1839 in what would become Corpus Christi. By 1842, a post office had
opened, and in 1845 the settlement experienced a brief boom, though population declined after
the Mexican War (Long 2010; Fox 1989).
The Mexican War began only three months after Texas’ formal annexation to the United States.
The primary issue of the conflict was the border between Mexico and the United States. When
Texas gained its independence from Mexico in 1836, it claimed the Rio Grande as its southern
boundary. In contrast, the Mexican government considered the Nueces River as the border. In
March 1846, under orders from the president, General Zachary Taylor moved his troops from
Corpus Christi to Brazos Santiago near the mouth of the Rio Grande River. The Mexican
government considered this movement of troops as an act of invasion and engaged the troops in
battle at Palo Alto and Resca de la Palma on May 8 and 9, 1846. This prompted the U.S.
Congress to pass a declaration of war, and hostilities moved south into Mexico. The war ended
with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with which the United States gained California, Arizona,
New Mexico and the Rio Grande boundary for Texas, as well as portions of Utah, Nevada, and
Colorado. The United States established a series of military posts along the Rio Grande as a line
of defense against further armed incursions into Texas. These included Camp Ringgold (Fort
Ringgold), Fort Brown, Camp Crawford (Fort McIntosh), and Fort Duncan (Bauer 2011; THC
1993).
During this period, large-scale ranching rapidly became one of the major bases of the economy
(Long 2010; A. Fox 1989). Large ranches such as Toluca Ranch and King Ranch were
established in the region. King Ranch ranks as one of the most outstanding and best known of
all cattle enterprises in the history of the southwestern cattle frontier. In 1852, Richard King
purchased several tracts of land fronting Santa Gertrudis Creek. The first grant obtained was the
Ricón de Santa Gertrudis, consisting of approximately 6,273 ha (15,500 ac) of land at the
junction of the Santa Gertrudis and San Fernando creeks near Laguna Madre. This parcel
included the area of present-day Kingsville. King also purchased Santa Gertrudis de la Garza
consisting of approximately 1,619 ha (4,000 ac) of land. It was on this land that King would
begin his cattle operation. In 1860, King founded R. King and Company, along with partners
James Walworth and Mifflin Kenedy, which joined all the land titles of James Woolworth, King
and his wife Henrietta, as well as Mifflin Kenedy (Coalson 2010; Chessman 2010; THC 1966).
The Toluca Ranch was founded in 1880 by Florencio Saenz (1836 to 1927) on part of the Llano
Grande (Big Plain) Grant which was deeded to Juan Jose Hinojosa Balli by the Spanish Crown in

1790. Saenz, a direct descendant of the Balli family, purchased a total of 6,434 ha (15,898 ac) of
land to establish his ranch through multiple purchases (THC 1983).
The secessional controversies that divided the North and South in the 1850s troubled and divided
Texans. The secession convention met in Austin on January 28, 1861, and was dominated by
secessionists. On February 1, 1861, the delegates adopted an ordinance of secession, and on
February 23 the ordinance was approved by the voters. Sam Houston, the Governor of Texas at
that time and a Unionist, refused to recognize the authority of the convention and take an oath of
allegiance to the new government. In response, the convention declared the office of governor
vacant and elevated Lieutenant Governor Edward Clark to the position (Wooster 2011). During
the Civil War, King and his partners entered into several contracts with the Confederate
government to supply European buyers with cotton while they, in return, supplied Confederate
forces with beef, horses, imported munitions, medical supplies, clothing, and shoes. King, who
also owned a steamship company, moved operations of the steamship to Matamoros under
Mexican registry, which successfully avoided Union blockades for the most part. At the end of
the war, King fled to Mexico, returning after securing his pardon from President Andrew
Johnson in 1865 (Coalson 2010; Chessman 2010; THC 1966).
3.2.5 Twentieth Century American Period
By 1903, the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico Railway was being built through south Texas
to Brownsville, and Henrietta King opened several tracts of her land for sale. Florencio Saenz
also granted right-of-way over his property for the railroad in 1904. With the introduction of the
railroad, the economic base of the area began to change from ranching to farming and dairying.
The population continued to rapidly grow in the region during the early part of the twentieth
century. Several industries, particularly the oil and gas industry, in the early to middle twentieth
century prompted additional population growth in the region (Stokes et al. 2009).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY METHODOLGY

Prior to the initial fieldwork, an archival record check was performed using the Texas
Archeological Site Atlas maintained by the THC. All previously conducted archaeological
investigations, archaeological sites, National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)-listed
properties, Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), Official Texas Historical Markers
(OTHMs), and Historic Texas Cemeteries (HTCs) recorded within the visual APEs of both the
proposed new and existing collocation towers were identified. This information was used to
identify any resources that may be affected by the proposed new tower and collocation of
equipment on existing towers. In addition, the information provided insight into the types of
resources that may be encountered during the surveys. Project historians examined the Historic
American Buildings Survey and Historic American Engineering Record of the National Park
Service (NPS), as well as historic maps and subdivision plats documenting the historic
development of the respective study areas.
Archaeological resource surveys were conducted at each of the proposed new and existing tower
sites with expanded footprints. Shovel testing was conducted at the tower footprints and along
non-disturbed portions of the access road and utility corridors where there was the potential for
buried deposits or where surface visibility was below 30 percent overall. Shovel testing was
conducted in accordance with linear surveys for the access road and utility corridors and three
shovel test pits (STPs) were excavated at tower sites. Shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (cm)
by 30 cm and were excavated to the base of Holocene deposits when possible. All material was
screened through ¼ inch mesh screens, and any recovered cultural material was analyzed in the
field and returned to the STP prior to backfilling. The majority of the access and utility corridors
associated with the proposed tower location sites are located along existing active unimproved
roads. As a result, modern material was present across the archaeological APEs of the proposed
tower location sites. Materials lacking distinctive historic attributes (such as clear glass shards,
amber glass shards, aluminum, etc.) were determined to be modern, and not considered to be
archaeological resources. All STPs were backfilled upon completion. Summaries and locations
of all the STPs excavated during the surveys are presented in tables and maps in Appendix A.
4.2

ABOVEGROUND/ARCHITECTURAL SURVEY METHODOLGY

Aboveground/architectural surveys were conducted in the APE for each of the proposed primary,
alternate, and tertiary option tower sites to assess if there was the potential to adversely effect
aboveground/architectural historic resources. Gulf South Research Corporation (GSRC)
personnel consulted the Texas Historic Sites Atlas to determine what previously recorded historic
resources were located within each APE.
The survey crew conducted field investigations from August 2015 to April 2016 and completed
the following:

Identified and photographed non-archaeological, historic-age resources (built by 1966)
within the proposed APEs.
Noted major physical attributes and design characteristics of each identified historic
resource.
Noted changes and alterations that may affect the integrity of each identified resource.
Documented and photographed notable characteristics of neighborhoods and streetscapes
in areas previously listed as a registered historic district.
Evaluated historic age resources for inclusion in the NRHP; to be eligible, a historic-age
resource must meet at least one of the four National Register Criteria, and it must retain
sufficient integrity to convey its significance. The resource should not only reflect, or be
associated with any, of the principal themes, patterns, and/or events discussed in the
historic context, it must also be significant within the framework of the context.

NRHP evaluations considered each historic resource on an individual basis and as a contributing
element within a district that met the criteria for inclusion in the NRHP. When assessing each
historic-age resource on an individual basis, the NRHP evaluation considered the significance of
associations with important events, trends, or individuals of the past (Criterion A or B), design
and/or physical attributes (Criterion C), or its research potential (Criterion D). A historic-age
resource that is significant for its historical associations does not need to retain its integrity to
such a high degree as one that is significant for its design or physical attributes; nonetheless, the
resource must still be easily recognizable to the period in which it achieved significance and be
able to convey its significance as an NRHP-eligible resource. In addition to the evalutation
criteria there are also criteria considerations to be applied to properties that are not usually
considered for listing in the NRHP, these include religioust properties (Criteria Consideration A),
moved properties (Critertia Consideration B), Birthplaces or Graves (Criteria Consideration C),
cemeteries (Criteria Consideration D), reconstructed properties (Criteria Consideration E),
commemorative properties (Criteria Consideration F), and properties achieving significance
within the past 50 years (Criteria Consideration G). Such properties can be eligible for listing if
they meet the Criteria for Evaluation, have integrity, and meet these criteria considerations.
Concentrations of historic resources may lack distinction on an individual basis, but collectively
may constitute a noteworthy grouping that is separate and distinct from its surroundings. In such
a situation, the collection of resources may be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP as a historic
district. To be eligible, the majority of the resources must have been built within the time frame
in which the district achieved significance (period of significance). The historic character and
overall integrity of the potential district are determined by the degree to which physical changes
to the historic-age resources, as well as the construction of modern infill (outside the period of
significance) and/or the demolition of historic-age resources, affect the potential district’s ability
to evoke a sense of the past. To be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, the district must be
significant within the framework of the context developed for the reconnaissance-level survey,
and it must retain sufficient integrity to convey that significance.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

A records search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was conducted prior to the initiation of
fieldwork to identify previously conducted cultural resources investigations, previously recorded
archaeological sites, and previously recorded NRHP-listed or NRHP-eligible historic properties,
RTHLs, OTHMs, and recorded HTCs. The records search utilized a radius of 1-mile (Table 5-1;
Figures A-1 to A-31). The NRHP includes buildings, structures, sites, objects, and districts that
possess significance at a local, state, or national level and retain sufficient integrity to convey
that significance. An RTHL is a property judged by the THC to be historically and
architecturally significant. The THC awards RTHL designation to buildings at least 50 years old
that are judged worthy of preservation for their architectural and historical associations. The
THC administers another type of marker program that is solely educational in nature and
conveys no legal designation or restrictions on the property. A resource that falls within this
category is listed as an OTHM. Administered by the THC, HTC designation is an official
recognition of family and community graveyards and encourages preservation of historic
cemeteries. The designation imposes no restrictions on private owners’ use of the land adjacent
to the cemetery, but it does provide for the recordation of the cemetery into the county deed
records as a historically dedicated property worthy of preservation. During the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) consultation process, two additional NRHP-eligible historic
districts (Cameron County Irrigation District No. 2 and Armstrong Ranch) were identified in the
viewsheds of 10 of the proposed tower sites. These resources have been determined to be
eligible for listing in the NRHP, but have not yet been formally listed and are not mapped or
listed within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas. As a result, the boundaries of those districts
are not included in the maps depicting the previously recorded historic resources in Appendix A.
Historic resources located within the archaeological and visual APEs of the towers are
summarized below.

5.1.1 HRL Beckwith Road and Levee Primary
5.1.1.1 Previously Conducted Archaeological Investigations
One previously conducted archaeological investigation (Atlas Number 15209) was on record as
being within 1 mile of the proposed HRL Beckwith Road and Levee Primary tower site (THC
2016). The investigation consisted of a survey conducted in 2008 for the Federal Housing
Administration (THC 2016). The survey does not overlap with the tower site or its access and
utility corridor (see Figure A-1).
5.1.1.2 Previously Recorded Archaeological Resources
Two previously recorded archaeological sites (41HG215 and 41HG230) are located within the 1mile radius of the proposed HRL Beckwith Road and Levee Primary tower site and its associated
roadway and utility corridor. Both of the archaeological sites overlap with a portion of the
access and utility corridor associated with the HRL Beckwith Road and Levee Primary tower
site. Two possibly conflicting site forms exist for site 41HG215. The first site form was
submitted in October 2007 with the site being recorded on October 20, 2007 by Environmental
Management, Inc. (e2M). Artifacts observed at the site included blue scalloped pearlware,
marbleized annular pearlware, slip-decorated coarse earthenware, and a dark green dip-molded

bottle glass fragment. Artifacts recorded at the site were limited to surface material. Given the
artifact assemblage, the original recorders suggested that the site may date to the Mexican and
Early American period. Due to the lack of archaeological sites dating to this period, the
recorders recommended the site for additional testing. A second site form for site 41HG215 was
submitted in April 2008, again by e2M. The site form indicated that it was not a site revisit,
though the field identifier matched with the earlier submitted site form (O10JG01). The site
form does not reference the earlier work conducted and refers to the site as an early twentieth
century subsurface trash dump. Artifacts recorded at the site during the 2008 visit include clear,
green, and solarized manganese bottle glass fragments, a terracotta sherd, and a heavily corroded
fragment of barbed wire. While the previous site form indicated that material was limited to the
surface, the second site form indicated that all material recorded was subsurface. The 2008
recorders of the site recommended 41HG215 not eligible for the NRHP. No NRHP eligibility
evaluation record is present within THC’s database (THC 2016).
Site 41HG230 consists of the historic alignment of Old Military Road within Hidalgo County.
The Old Military Road stretches from La Puerta, Texas, where it intersects with the existing
Highway 83 south, then following the border to Brownsville, Texas. The site was originally
recorded in 2009 and a portion of the original road bed was encountered during the shovel testing
of archaeological site 41HG177 and again during the 2009 test excavations of that site to
determine its eligibility for the NRHP. The cultural feature noted at the site consisted of rounded
and aligned cobbles and stones with associated large pieces of cedar found at a depth of 46
centimeters below ground surface (cmbgs). The current site, as mapped, is based on historic
maps dating between 1914 and 1938. The 2009 assessment determined that the historic Military
Road was eligible for listing in the NRHP individually under Criteria A and D, and may be a
contributing element of a potential NRHP-eligible archaeological district associated with the
Mexican American War Battlefield. Three NRHP eligibility reviews were on record with the
THC for site 41HG230. The first, dated 2010, lists an undetermined SHPO eligibility
determination. Two subsequent eligibility reviews, dated 2011 and 2014, determined that
portions of the site that were within the ROW of those projects were ineligible.
5.1.1.3 Previously Recorded Historic Resources
Two cemeteries (Relampago [HG-C008] and Guzman-Toluca [HG-C005]), one NRHP-listed
historic district (Rancho Toluca), and one OTHM (Saint Joseph's Church [4458]) are on record
as being within the 1-mile radius of the proposed HRL Beckwith Road and Levee Primary tower
site and its associated roadway and utility corridors. Neither of the cemeteries designates an
HTC and the OTHM designates an RTHL. All of the historic resources are outside of the visual
APE of the tower site.
5.1.2 HRL Beckwith Road and Levee Alternate
5.1.2.1 Previously Conducted Archaeological Investigations
One previously conducted archaeological investigation (Atlas Number 15209) was on file as
being within 1 mile of the proposed HRL Beckwith Road and Levee Alternate tower site (THC
2016). The investigation consisted of a survey conducted in 2008 for the Federal Housing
Administration (THC 2016). The survey does not overlap with the tower site or its access and
utility corridor (see Figure A-1).

5.1.5 HRL McMannis Bend Alternate
5.1.5.1 Previously Conducted Archaeological Surveys
One previously conducted archaeological investigation (628) is on record as being within the 1mile radius of the proposed HRL McMannis Bend Alternate tower site and associated access and
utility corridors (see Figure A-3). The archaeological investigation consisted of a survey and did
not overlap with the footprints of the tower or its associated access and utility corridors (THC
2016).
5.1.5.2 Previously Recorded Archaeological Resources
Two archaeological sites (41CF128 and 41CF208) are on record as being within the 1-mile
radius for the HRL McMannis Bend Alternate tower site and its associated access and utility
corridor (see Figure A-3). None of the sites overlap with the footprints of the tower or its
associated access and utility corridor (THC 2016).
5.1.5.3 Previously Recorded Historic Resources
One OTHM (Our Lady of Visitation Catholic Church [3887]) is on record as being within the 1mile radius of HRL McMannis Bend Alternate tower site and its associated access and utility
corridor (THC 2016). The OTHM does designate an RTHL but is not within the 0.5-mile visual
APE of tower site (see Figure A-3).
5.1.6 HRL Hacienda Alternate
5.1.6.1 Previously Conducted Archaeological Surveys
No previously conducted archaeological investigations are on record as being within the 1-mile
radius of the HRL Hacienda Alternate tower site or its associated access and utility corridors

Hacienda Alternate tower location and its associated access and utility corridor (see Figure A-4).
The site overlaps with the northern terminus of the associated access and utility corridor for the
HRL Hacienda Alternate tower location (THC 2016). The site is the historic alignment of the
Old Military Highway as it is mapped in Cameron County and shares the same description as
41HG230, which is described under Section 5.1.1.2. One site update form was prepared for site
41CF208 in 2015 which found no evidence of the historic roadway within a project area along
US 281 between FM 3248 and FM 1421. While there are three NRHP eligibility determinations
on record for site 41HG230, there are none for 41CF208 and it is considered to have an
undetermined eligibility for the NRHP.
5.1.6.3 Previously Recorded Historic Resources
One historic cemetery (Longoria Cemetery #1 [CF-C001]) and three OTHMs (Our Lady of
Visitation Catholic Church [3887], Rancho de Santa Maria [4182], and Longoria Cemetery
[11681]) are on record as being within the 1-mile radius of the proposed new HRL Hacienda
Alternate tower site (see Figure A-4). The cemetery is a designated HTC and one of the OTHMs
(Our Lady of Visitation Catholic Church [3887]) designates an RTHL. None of the historic
resources are located within the 0.50-mile visual APE of the tower site.

consisted of a block survey conducted in 2005 for the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) by SWCA Environmental Consultants. No archaeological sites were recorded within the
survey corridor as a result of that survey.
5.1.9.2 Previously Recorded Archaeological Resources
Nine archaeological resources (41CF166, 41CF167, 41CF168, 41CF169, 41CF170, 41CF171,
41CF172, 41CF173, and 41CF208) are within the 1-mile radius of the proposed HRL Galveston
Bend Primary tower site and its associated access and utility corridor (see Figure A-6). Two of
the archaeological sites (41CF167 and 41CF208) overlap with a portion of the footprint of the
proposed HRL Galveston Bend Primary tower site and its associated access and utility corridor
(see Figure A-6).
Site 41CF167 was originally recorded in January 1997 as part of the Mexican-American
Battlefield Survey project sponsored by the National Park Service. Work conducted at the site at
that time was limited to a surface reconnaissance and select surface collection of temporally
diagnostic material, and included yellowware, lead-glazed earthenware, dark green and olive
green bottle glass shards, milk glass, plain whiteware, and decorated whiteware. Given the
archival evidence and temporally diagnostic material recovered, the site was likely occupied
from ca 1860 to 1950 or later. No features were noted during the site’s initial recording, though
the site form does note that several structures are present in the area on the 1956 topographic
quadrangle. The site has been subject to deep plowing and the original recorders estimated that
less than 50 percent of the site remained intact. Despite the relative low integrity of the site, the
original recorders noted that the site may have the potential to contribute important information
on the late nineteenth to early twentieth century farming and economics in the lower Rio Grande
Valley. As a result, they recommended additional intensive archival investigations regarding the
establishment of the ranch and shovel testing and systematic surface collection to define the
plantation layout, and estimate the location of possible structures and features. Site 41CF208 has
been previously described in Section 5.1.6.2.
5.1.9.3 Previously Recorded Aboveground/Architectural Resources
Two OTHMs (Thorton Skirmish [5478] and Alonso de Leon Expeditions [6042]) and two
cemeteries (Los Alamos Cemetery at Galveston Ranch [CF-C008] and Weaver Cemetery #2
[CF-C012]) are located as being within the 1-mile radius of the proposed Galveston Bend
Primary tower site and associated access and utility corridors. Neither of the OTHMs represent
RTHLs and both are outside of the 0.5-mile visual APE of the tower site (THC 2016) (see Figure
A-6). The Los Alamos Cemetery at Galveston Ranch (CF-C008) is a designated HTC and is
located within the 0.5-mile visual APE of tower site. The Weaver Cemetery #2 (CF-C012) is not
a designated HTC and is located outside of the 0.5-mile visual APE.
5.1.10 HRL Galveston Bend Alternate
5.1.10.1 Previously Conducted Archaeological Surveys
One previously conducted archaeological investigation (11796) is on record as being within the

Fourteen previously conducted archaeological investigations (384, 436, 452, 9912, 11067,
11582, 12177, 12245, 13973, 14992, 15249, 15307, 25361, and 25399) are on record as being
within the 1-mile radius of the proposed BRP FTBGC Y Primary tower site and its associated
utility corridor (see Figure A-17). Thirteen of the projects consisted of surveys (384, 436, 452,
9912, 11067, 11582, 12177, 12245, 13973, 14992, 15249, 15307, and 25361) and one
investigation (25399) included both archaeological survey and archaeological testing (THC
2016).
Three of the archaeological investigations (384, 436, and 452) overlap with the BRP FTBGC
Primary tower site and its associated access and utility corridor. The first investigation (384)
consisted of an archaeological survey conducted in 1998 for the University of Texas at
Brownsville. The second survey (436) consisted of an archaeological survey conducted in 1996
for Espey Huston and Associates. The final investigation (452) consisted of a survey conducted
in 1987 for IBWC. No archaeological resources were identified with the footprint of the tower
site or its associated access and utility corridor as a result of these surveys (THC 2016).
5.2.7.2 Previously Recorded Archaeological Resources
Twenty one previously recorded archaeological resources (41CF94, 41CF95,41CF96, 41CF126,

Four OTHMs (Fort Brown Cavalry Barracks [1965], Fort Brown Commissary/Guardhouse
[1969], Neale House [3559], and Post Hospital Annex [4087]) and one NRHP-listed historic
district (Fort Brown) are located within the 0.5-mile visual APE of the proposed BRP FTBGC
Primary tower site. The Fort Brown historic district was listed in the NRHP on October 15,
1966, and is significant on the National Level. The historic district is also a National Historic
Landmark. Fort Brown was established on the Rio Grande with the arrival of Zachary Taylor on
March 26, 1846, to establish the river as the southern boundary of the United States. By April
1846, Taylor had built an earthen fort at the location. The fort was held by a strong force during
the Mexican War and permanent post and quarters were established in 1848 0.25 mile north of
the first site. The fort continued to be occupied during the 1850s to protect against raids from
Native Americans as well as incursions into Texas by Mexico. The fort was first occupied by the
Confederates in 1861, then by Union forces in 1863. After the civil war, starting in 1869, the
fort was rebuilt with brick buildings which included the post hospital, an administration building,
a large officer’s quarters, and a chapel. The fort was operational through World War I, until
official deactivation of the fort was announced by the War Department in 1945 (Davenport
2011).

5.3.1 FTB Zone 34 Primary
5.3.1.1 Previously Conducted Archaeological Investigations
Seven previously conducted archaeological investigations (436, 452, 11853, 15067, 15307,
25399, and 60986) are on record as being within the 1-mile radius of the proposed FTB Zone 34
Primary tower site and its associated access and utility corridors (see Figure A-18). Five of the
archaeological investigations (436, 452, 11853, 15067, and 15307) consisted of surveys, one
(25399) consisted of both survey and test excavations, and one (60986) consisted of test
excavations (THC 2016).
Two of the archaeological investigations overlap with portions of the FTP Zone 34 Primary
tower footprint and its associated access and utility corridors. The first investigation (452)
consisted of a survey conducted in 1987 for IBWC. The second investigation (25399) consisted
of an archaeological survey and subsequent test excavations conducted in 2012 for the Cameron
County Regional Mobility Authority (CCRMA). That investigation included the excavation of
63 backhoe trenches, as well as 11 STPs. The trenching revealed relatively recent floodplain
deposits across most of the area and noted extensive subsurface disturbance in many areas of the
survey corridor. No archaeological resources were identified within the footprint of tower site or
its associated access and utility corridor as a result of any of the surveys conducted (THC 2016).
5.3.1.2 Previously Recorded Archaeological Resources
Two previously recorded archaeological resources (41CF215 and 41CCF216) are within the 1mile radius for the proposed FTB Zone 34 Primary tower site and its associated access and utility

Three of the archaeological investigations (452, 25399, and 60986) overlap with portions of the
FTB Pig Pens Primary tower site and its associated access corridor. The first investigation (452)
consisted of a survey conducted in 1987 for IBWC. The second investigation (25399) consisted
of archaeological survey and subsequent test excavations conducted in 2012 for the CCRMA.
That investigation included the excavation of 63 backhoe trenches, as well as 11 STPs. The
trenching revealed relatively recent floodplain deposits across most the area and noted extensive
subsurface disturbance in many areas of the survey corridor. The investigation identified one
archaeological site (41CF216), which overlapped the northern portion of the access corridor for
the FTB Pig Pens Road Primary tower site location. The third investigation consisted of
archaeological significance testing conducted at site 41CF216. The test excavations focused on a
historic refuse scatter (Refuse Area 1), which extended into the project area for the CCRMA
project. The investigation included mechanical excavation of backhoe trenches along with hand
excavated test units. The testing revealed that the deposits in Refuse Area 1 were shallow and
lacked integrity. As a result, Refuse Area 1 was not considered significant and did not contribute
to the site’s overall eligibility for the NRHP (THC 2016).
5.3.3.2 Previously Recorded Archaeological Resources
One previously recorded archaeological resource (41CF216) is within the 1-mile radius for the
proposed FTB Pig Pens Road tower site and its associated access corridor (see Figure A-19)

5.3.4.2 Previously Recorded Archaeological Resources
One previously recorded archaeological resource (41CF216) is within the 1-mile radius for the
proposed FTB Pig Pens Road Alternate tower site and its associated access corridor (see Figure
A-19) (THC 2016). The archaeological site overlaps with the northern portion of the access road
associated with the FTB Pig Pens Road Alternate tower site (see Figure A-19). The site consists
of the extant historic Piper Plantation structures, as well as its associated cultural deposits.
Artifacts recorded at the site include glass shards, whole bottles, whiteware, agricultural
materials, wire nails, corrugated tin siding and roofing, milled creosote wood timbers, and wire.
Features present at site 41CF216 include the remains of a silo foundation, a corral, two livestock

pens, three cisterns, an indeterminate foundation, the remains of an abandoned railway and
possible associated brick and mortar culvert, and two dump areas. Based on archival research
and the artifacts present, the site dates to the early twentieth century historic period (1901 to
present). The original recorders of the site recommended the site eligible for the NRHP. Two
National Register Eligibility Reviews were on record for site 41CF216. The SHPO eligibility
determination of the first review was undetermined and was made in November 2012. The
second review, conducted in August 2014, had a SHPO eligibility determination of “Ineligible
within the ROW” of the CCRMA project.

2016).
Three of the archaeological investigations (11247, 25331, and 25339) overlap with portions of
the FTB East of Sable Palm Primary tower site and its associated access road. The first of these
investigations (11247) was an archaeological survey that was conducted in 2005 for the Texas
Water Development Board (TWDB). That survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 3661 and included pedestrian archaeological survey as well as the excavation of
backhoe trenches. The second investigation (25331) consisted of an archaeological survey
conducted in 2011 for CCRMA under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5899 and consisted of
pedestrian survey supplemented with the excavation of STPs. The final investigation (25339)
consisted of archaeological survey and subsequent test excavations conducted in 2012 for the
CCRMA andincluded the excavation of 63 backhoe trenches as well as 11 STPs. The trenching
revealed relatively recent floodplain deposits across most the area and noted extensive
subsurface disturbance in many areas of the survey corridor. The previously conducted
archaeological investigations completely encompassed the proposed FTB East of Sable Palms
Primary tower footprint, as well as its associated access corridor. No archaeological sites were
identified within the footprint of the tower site or its associated access road.

Battle of Palmito Ranch was the last land action of the Civil War and took place on May 13,
1865, a month after the surrender of General Lee. The battle ended with the retreat of the Union
forces to Brazos Island where Confederate troops ceased their advance. By the end of the battle,
Confederate causalities were a few dozen while the federal forces had 111 men and four officers
captured and thirty men wounded or killed. At the same time the battle was occurring, the

The King Ranch historic district was listed in the NRHP in October 15, 1966 and is significant
on the national level. The boundaries of the King Ranch historic district were drawn to include
the major core of the King Ranch, Inc. at the time that the historic district was recorded.
Although the land area of the ranch had been in almost constant flux from the time that Richard
King purchased the first parcel of land, the basic distribution of the northern and southern sectors
has remained constant. The historic district boundary includes the Santa Gertrudis, Laureles, and
Norias divisions, which embody the ranch in its first period under Richard King. The periods of
significance extend from 1850 to 1924 and the areas of significance included exploration and
settlement, as well as agriculture (ranching).
Richard King first arrived in Texas in 1847, as a riverboat pilot, with long-time friend Mifflin
Kenedy. King had piloted steamboats during the war, and afterwards started his own steamboat
line. In 1850, he joined Kenedy and two other investors to form M. Kenedy and Company of
Brownsville. The company, utilizing steamboats designed by King for the Rio Grande, soon had
a monopoly of commercial traffic on the river. King would continue to work in the riverboat
business until 1874.

In 1850, in association with an old friend, Legs Lewis, King started investing in land. King’s
knowledge of some of the old Rio Grande families was invaluable in obtaining land titles that
had clear chains of title. King and Lewis set up camp near the springs that fed Santa Gertrudis
Creek. Lewis formed the Texas Mounted Volunteers to provide protection in the area from
Indians, hide-peelers (people that stole and skinned cattle often while the animal was still alive),
mustangers, and other marauders, while King, through the use of his riverboat company,
provided the capital needed for the land investments. Initial land purchases made by King
centered on Santa Gertrudis Creek. Two tracts of land were purchased concurrently. Ricón de
Santa Gertrudis, comprising approximately 6,273 ha (15,500 ac), was initially purchased
followed by Santa Gertrudis de la Garza, comprising approximately 21,853 ha (54,000 ac).
On these initial plots of land, King began his cattle operation, buying cattle from Mexico and
hiring Mexican cowboys or vaqueros to herd them. He eventually moved a whole village from
the hills of Tamaulipas to his ranch, setting up the community as his employees. King purchased
additional parcels of land including the Puerto de Agua Dulce, as well as parcels on Padre Island.
In 1860, King founded R. King and Company, which joined all the land titles of James
Woolworth, King, and his wife Henrietta. In 1862, King bought 36,421 ha (90,000 ac) named
the Lareles tract and another 22,000 acres from William Mann in the Ryas Blanca grant, north of
Santa Gertrudis. Ranch headquarters had also become the official receiving, storage, and
shipping point for cotton on the Matamoros market. During the Civil War, King contracted to
furnish beef for the Confederate Army.
In 1868, Kenedy began his own independent ranching operation, taking 26 leagues of the
Laureles grant. In return for King’s Brownsville town property and three tracts of unrelated
pasture, Kenedy traded all of his interest in Santa Gertrudis, as well as the Corpus Christi
property. Following the war, raids from Mexican bandits started to rise and, until 1875,
continued persistently and unchecked. By the end of these raids, King had suffered losses
totaling one million dollars. Despite the losses, King continued to buy land and acquired a large
section of the San Carricitos grant in south Texas.
Richard King passed away on April 14, 1884, leaving his heirs land valued at 564,784 dollars
and livestock worth 496,700 dollars. After his death, his son-in-law continued land acquisition,
as well as methodical breeding of cattle. Even though difficult financial times during the 1880s
necessitated the selling of approximately 10,995 acres of land, efforts continued to consolidate
and obtain land grants for the ranch. In 1901, they bought 60,000 acres in Las Comitos, El
Infernillo, and most of El Chiltipin land grants. In 1906, Ricón de los Laureles was purchased
from the Texas Land and Cattle Company totaling 110,000 acres.
During the first decade of the new century, Mrs. Henrietta King gave half interest in 75,000 acres
and right-of-way across her property to form the St. Louis, Brownsville, Mexico Railroad. This
was divided in 41,820 acres along the railroad, including Kingsville’s 853 acres, as well as
34,855 acres around Raymondville for town development. In 1907, Theodore Koch bought
23,880 acres of Rincón de la Boveda to develop the town of Rivera. When Kleberg County was
formed in 1913, the King property comprised approximately 80 percent of the county. At the
death of Henrietta King in 1924, the estate owned 997,445 acres, not including the 30,439 acres
of Santa Gertrudis headwaters, as well as the Stillman and Lasater tracts, which Henrietta had
previously given to her daughter Alice and son-in-law Robert Kleberg.

King Ranch ranks as one of the most outstanding and best known of all cattle enterprises in the
history of the southwestern cattle frontier. The only new breed of cattle to be developed in the
United States, the Santa Gertrudis breed, was produced on King Ranch. In addition, studies of
grassland and animal diseases conducted at King Ranch contributed greatly to the cattle industry.

CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS

Archaeological resource surveys were conducted for all the proposed tower sites, as well as their
associated access and utility corridors. Two new archaeological sites were recorded during the
archaeological surveys. Historic resource surveys were conducted for all the proposed tower
sites where there was a potential for effects on historic-age resources within the visual APE of
the proposed tower. The results of these investigations are presented below and organized by
AOR and tower site.
6.1

HARLINGEN STATION AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY

A total of 22 proposed tower sites, along with their associated utility and access corridors, were
surveyed for archaeological and historic resources within the HRL Station AOR. One
archaeological site was recorded during the surveys conducted within the HRL Station AOR.
Summaries of the results of the archaeological and historical resource surveys are outlined in the
following sections by tower.
6.1.1 HRL Beckwith Road and Levee Primary
6.1.1.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
The archaeological survey of the HRL Beckwith Road and Levee Primary tower site and its
associated access and utility corridor consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey supplemented
with the excavation of three STPs at the proposed tower site (T1-STP1 to T2-STP3) and the
excavation of six STPs along the proposed access and utility corridor (T2-STP1 to T2-STP6)
(see Photographs B-1 to B-6). None of the STPs were positive for historic or prehistoric cultural
material, and no archaeological resources were recorded (Table 6-1; see Figure A-33). The
northern portion of the access road (north of T2-STP6) widened greater than the 60-ft survey
corridor. As a result, STPs could not be excavated along this portion and it was subject to
pedestrian survey only. Two previously recorded archaeological sites (41HG215 and 41HG230)
are mapped as overlapping with portions of the access and utility corridor (see Figure A-1). No
evidence of these sites was recorded during the archaeological surveys and it was concluded that
the sites do not actually extend into the current survey corridor.

6.1.1.2 Historic Resource Investigations
No previously recorded aboveground/architectural resources that are listed in the NRHP, or that
are eligible for listing in the NRHP, are located within the visual APE of the proposed HRL
Beckwith Road and Levee Primary tower site. The existing structures within the visual APE of
the tower site are a large commercial building and a small residential building.
6.1.2 HRL Beckwith Road and Levee Alternate
6.1.2.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
The archaeological survey of the HRL Beckwith Road and Levee Alternate tower site and its
associated access and utility corridor consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey supplemented
with the excavation of three STPs at the proposed tower site (T1-STP1 to T2-STP3) (Table 6-2;
see Figure A-34). The access and utility corridor for the tower site location is partially shared
with the HRL Beckwith Road and Levee Primary tower site location (T2-STP4 to T2-STP6) (see
Table 6-1). As mapped, site 41HG215 overlaps with a large portion of the tower footprint for
the tower site location; however no evidence of that site was found within the tower footprint
(see Figure A-1), see Photographs B7 to B-10). Two conflicting (see discussion in Section
5.1.1.1) site forms exist for 41HG215, and the site may be mislocated or may not extend into the
current survey area.

three STPs at the proposed tower site (T1-STP1 to T2-STP3) and the pedestrian survey along
access corridor (see Photographs B-11 to B-16). The width of the existing road within the access
road corridor did not allow for the excavation of STPs. One of the STPs (T1-STP2 recovered a
single scalloped whiteware rim sherd, which was recorded as an isolated occurrence (IORioRico-P-1) (Table 6-3; see Figure A-35).

IO-RioRico-P-1 was recorded from a single positive transect STP (T1-STP2) that recovered a
single scalloped whiteware rim sherd from 10 to 20 cmbgs. Additional STPs excavated at the
tower site (T1-STP1 and T1-STP2) and surface inspection of the area failed to record any
additional cultural material. The area encompassing the find is heavily disturbed. Figure A-36
shows a the 1956 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle showing the APE of the Rio Rico Road and
Pump Primary tower location as well as the location of the find. Structures are depicted to both
the east and south of the APE of the tower footprint and the whiteware sherd. The whiteware
sherd could represent scatter from the demolition of either of these two mapped structures. No
additional historic topographic quadrangles were found during the archival map research of the
find. As a result, the find is considered to be an isolated occurrence (IO-RioRico-P-1).
6.1.3.2 Historic Resource Investigations
No previously recorded aboveground/architectural historic resources that are listed in the NRHP,
or that are eligible for listing in the NRHP, are located within the visual APE of the proposed
HRL Rio Rico Rd and Pump Primary tower site. The existing structures that are present within
the visual APE of the tower site are small residential buildings.

Photographs B-17 to B-20). Buried gas and water pipelines on either side of the existing road
prevented excavation of STPs along the access and utility corridor. The access and utility
corridors were subject to pedestrian surface inspection. None of the STPs were positive for
cultural material and no archaeological resources were recorded during the survey of the tower
site location (Table 6-4; see Figure A-37).

associated canal, which prevented the excavation of STPs. As a result, the access and utility
corridor was subject to pedestrian surface inspection. None of the STPs were positive for
cultural material and no archaeological resources were recorded during the survey of the tower

6.1.5.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One aboveground/architectural historic resource (Champion Cemetery [Cemetery ID No. CFC011]) is located within the visual APE of the proposed HRL McMannis Bend Alternate tower
site (see Figure A-3). The cemetery is located 0.19 mile east from the center of the tower site.
No established date is known for the cemetery. GSRC personnel were unable to document the
site, as it is located on private property; however, there does not appear to be any remaining
headstones visible at the cemetery. The tower site is likely visible from all points in the
cemetery, but would not constitute an adverse visual element. Additional structures within the
visual APE of the tower site consist of small residential and commercial buildings.

41CF167
Site 41CF167 was originally recorded in January 1997 as part of the Mexican-American
Battlefield Survey project sponsored by the National Park Service and information about the
original recording of the site is presented in Section 5.1.9.2 (see Figure A-6). An examination of
the 1956 Santa Maria, TX 15-minute quadrangle, conducted by GSRC personnel, notes six
structures present within the area, with three indicated on the western side of a north-south road
and another three on the eastern side of a north-south road. The 1936 Santa Maria, TX 15minute topographic quadrangle shows only two structures on the west side of the north-south
road, and depicts the historic alignment of Old Military Highway immediately north of the
structures (see Figure A-43). This suggests the older, historic portion of the ranch was
concentrated on the west side of the road.

The current field investigation was limited to the eastern portion of the site where it intersects
with the access and utility corridor and the tower footprint. Two of the STPs (T1-STP2 and T1STP3) had to be offset and excavated adjacent to the tower footprint because disturbance and
compaction of the soil prevented excavation within the tower footprint. STP T1-STP2,
excavated within the site boundaries, was positive for cultural material (a single brick fragment)
but also recovered modern material (a plastic fragment) below the brick fragment, suggesting
that the deposits have a low integrity (see Figure A-42). STP T1-STP3, placed outside of the site
boundary to the east, was negative for cultural material. STP T1-STP1, placed outside of the site
area to the north, recovered a single sherd of whiteware, which may represent plow scatter from
the site.
Surface reconnaissance was limited largely to the tower footprint and associated access and
utility corridor and noted additional material including a single sherd of salt-glazed stoneware, a
single molded porcelain sherd with floral decoration, a single porcelain basal sherd, three plain
whiteware body sherds, one green-glazed whiteware sherd, 12 curved glass shards in various
colors (colorless, green, amber, and light olive), two bone fragments, and one brick fragment.
The artifact scatter was concentrated on the west side of the access and utility corridor with
increasing concentration extending westward beyond the survey boundaries. Given the surface
expression of artifacts, as well as the results of the limited shovel testing conducted at the tower
footprint, the site boundaries as currently mapped in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas are
accurate and require no adjustment. No intact structural features or discrete concentrations of
architectural material were noted within the tower or access and utility corridor footprint.
The majority of the site and the heaviest concentration of cultural material are located outside of
the current survey area to the west. In addition, archival evidence indicates that the late
nineteenth to early twentieth portion of the site was concentrated on the western side of the road.
The portion of the site within the current survey area is heavily disturbed with a relatively lowdensity artifact scatter. Given the disturbance and low artifact concentration, the portion of the
site within the tower footprint and associated access and utility corridor is not considered to be a
contributing element of the site’s information potential. As a result, development of the HRL
Galveston Bend Primary tower location is not considered to have an adverse effect on site
41CF167’s potential eligibility for the NRHP. It is recommended that the placement of utilities
along the access and utility corridor be restricted to the eastern side of the existing road, where
the artifact scatter is sparse and disturbed.
41CF208
Site 41CF208 represents the historic alignment of Old Military Highway (see Figure A-6). The
site cuts across the access and utility corridor and through the northern portion of the tower
footprint of the HRL Galveston Bend Primary tower site location. Two STPs were excavated
within the footprint of site 41CF208 to assess if any intact features of the historic road were
present. STP T1-STP2 recovered a single sherd of plain whiteware, but lacked evidence of the
historic roadbed. STP T1-STP3 was negative for cultural material and found no evidence of the
historic roadbed associated with Old Military Highway. As a result, no intact features of site
41CF208 were recorded and the site is not considered to extend into the current survey area.

6.1.9.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One aboveground/architectural historic resource (Los Alamos Cemetery at Galveston Ranch
[Cemetery ID No. CFC008]), identified by GSRC personnel, was recorded within the visual APE
of the proposed HRL Galveston Bend Primary tower site (see Figure A-6). The cemetery (see
Photograph B-46) is located 0.29 mile southeast from the center of the tower site and is a
designated HTC. The cemetery was established in the early nineteenth century, and is
approximately 0.43 acre. The cemetery contains one brick mausoleum and several small
headstones. The tower site is likely to be visible from all points in the cemetery, but would not
constitute an adverse visual element. Additional structures present in the visual APE of the
tower site consist of small utility buildings.

6.1.10.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint during the survey
of the HRL Galveston Bend Alternate tower location site (Table 6-10; see Figure A-44). The
tower site partially shares the access and utility corridor with the HRL Galveston Bend Primary
tower location site (T2-STP1 to T2-STP12). The remaining portion of the access and utility
corrdior was situated on a man-made levee which prevented the excavation of STPs and was
subject to pedestrian surface inspection. No STPs were positive for cultural material and no
archaeological sites were recorded during the survey of the tower location site and its associated
access and utility corridor. The access and utility corridor passes through two previously
recorded archaeological sites (41CF167 and 41CF208) (see Figure A-6). Both previously
recorded archaeological sites and their investigation are described in Section 6.1.9.1. No adverse
effects on the sites are anticipated if placement of the utilities is restricted to the east side of the
existing road and road maintenance activities are limited to the existing roadbed.

6.1.11.2 Historic Resource Investigations
The proposed HRL San Benito Pump Primary tower site is located within the boundaries of a
previously recorded NRHP-eligible historic resource (Cameron County Irrigation District No. 2).
There are no existing structures present in the visual APE of the tower site and no adverse effects
on the NRHP-eligible district are anticipated from the construction of the tower site. The Los
Indios Cemetery (Cemetery ID No. CF-C050) (see Figure A-7; see Photograph B-54) runs along
the eastern side of the access road (Weber Road) for the tower site; however, it is unlikely that
the access road will have an adverse effect on the cemetery, as it is preexisting thoroughfare.

6.1.12.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One aboveground/architectural historic resource (Los Indios Cemetery [Cemetery ID No. CFC050]), identified by GSRC personnel, was recorded within the visual APE of the proposed HRL
San Benito Pump Alternate tower site (see Figure A-7). The cemetery (see Photograph B-54) is
located 0.50 mile north of the center of the tower site. It is approximately 0.41 acre, with no
established date. The tower site is likely to be visible from all points in the cemetery, but it
would not constitute an adverse visual element. The access road (Weber Road) for the tower site
runs along the west (rear) side of the cemetery, but will unlikely have an adverse effect on the
cemetery, as it is a preexisting thoroughfare. In addition, the tower site is located within the
boundaries of a previously recorded NRHP-eligible historic district (Cameron County Irrigation
District No. 2). Given the presence of other modern features, no visual impacts on the NRHPeligible historic district are anticipated from the development of the tower site. Additional
structures in the visual APE of the tower site consist of small residential and commercial
buildings.
6.1.13 HRL Moodyville Road and Levee Primary
6.1.13.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
The proposed HRL Moodyville Road and Levee Primary tower site is located within the
developed CBP Border Checkpoint facility (see Figure A-47 and Photographs B-63 to B-70).
Personnel at the facility indicated that unmarked utility lines ran across the footprint of the tower
site that were placed during its construction. Given the presence of unmarked utilities, no STPs
were excavated at the tower location and the area was subject to pedestrian survey. The area was
landscaped and ground visibility was poor (10 to 15 percent), but evidence of disturbance and
land leveling was noted across the tower site. No archaeological resources were recorded during
the survey tower site location.
6.1.13.2 Historic Resource Investigations
The proposed HRL Moodyville Road and Levee Primary tower site is located within an NRHPeligible historic district (Cameron County Irrigation District No. 2). The structures in the visual
APE of the tower site consist of modern large commercial buildings. Given the presence of
existing modern buildings, no adverse visual effects on the NRHP-eligible district are anticipated
from the construction of the tower site.

6.1.14.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
The proposed HRL Moodyville Road and Levee Alternate tower site is located within the
developed CBP Border Checkpoint facility (see Figure A-48 and Photographs B-71 to B-78).
The area encompassing the proposed tower footprint was previously surveyed in 2004 (15184).
The proposed tower site is in a neutral area between two opposing lanes of traffic, coming into
and out of the checkpoint. Personnel at the checkpoint facility stated this area had unmarked
underground utilities that were installed when the facility was built. Given the presence of
unmarked utilities and the fact that the majority of the footprint was previously subject to
archaeological survey, no STPs were excavated. The area was subject to pedestrian surface
examination. The area was landscaped and ground visibility was poor (10 to 15 percent), but
evidence of disturbance and land leveling was noted across the tower site. Poles indicating
buried utilities, as well as an electrical junction box, were present within the proposed footprint
of the tower. No archaeological resources were recorded during the survey of the tower site
location.

determine if additional cultural material was present, but none were positive for cultural material
(Table 6-15; see Figure A-51). The soil profile of STP T1-STP2 showed two strata. Stratum I
consisted of a grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay loam from 0 to 20 cmbgs, followed by stratum II
from 20 to 51 cmbgs, which consisted of a light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) clay loam.

~ 5 meters south of concrete well

In addition to the cultural material that was recorded in the STP T1-STP2, a single feature was
noted at the site (F.1) (see Photograph B-94). The feature consists of a well/cistern made of
three vertically stacked, 3-ft-tall, pre-poured cylindrical concrete sections. The concrete sections
have 3-inch-thick walls, with a 3-ft exterior diameter and a 2-ft, 6-inch interior diameter. Since
the feature is composed of three sections, the feature is 9 ft in height. The top of the concrete
well/cistern is 2 ft, 7 inches above ground surface. An etched inscription on the top section of
concrete reads, "81UCP60/9-26-49", which suggests that section was poured in September 1949,
dating the construction of the cement feature to sometime after that date. A local resident
informed us that there was a house at the site which was abandoned during the 1960s. According
to the informant, the concrete feature was used as a holding tank and not a well, and water was
pumped to the feature from the Rio Grande through pipes.
Given the lack of cultural material recovered from the additional STPs excavated, the site
boundary was established around the single positive transect STP and concreted feature (F.1).
The site measures 11 meters east to west by 9 meters north to south, and has a total site area of
71 square meters. The site is situated on a cleared and mowed piece of property that is within the
Rio Grande floodplain. Man-made canals and levees are situated to the south and west of the
property (see Figure A-51). Vegetation at the site includes an overstory of honey mesquite and
Texas ebony, and an understory of guinea grass (Urochloa maxima) (see Photograph B-95).
Artifacts were recovered from STP T1-STP2 to a depth of 30 cmbgs and consisted of historic
glass (nine shards aquamarine flat glass and one amber curved glass) and metal (one coin,
indeterminate ferrous metal fragments). The only diagnostic artifact recovered was a 1951
Mexican 20 Centavos coin (see Photographs B-96 and B-97). Historic topographic quadrangles
depict a structure in the vicinity of the site in the 1929, 1936, and 1956 La Paloma, TX 7.5minute topographic quadrangles, but no structure is depicted in the 2002 or 2010 La Paloma, TX
7.5-minute topographic quadrangles. These findings suggest that occupation of the site may
extend from the early part of the twentieth century through the middle part of the twentieth
century. Given the limited artifact assemblage and modern nature of the material, the site has
little or no potential to provide information on the historic settlement of the Rio Grande Valley.
The site is not recommended eligible for the NRHP under any criteria.
6.1.16.2 Historic Resource Investigations
Two aboveground/architectural historic resources (The Gomez Cemetery [Cemetery ID No. CFC050] and Cameron County Irrigation District No. 2), identified by GSRC personnel, were

6.1.18.2 Historic Resource Investigations
The HRL Wells Bros Canal Alternate tower site is located within the boundaris of the previously
recorded NRHP-eligible Cameron County Irrigation District No. 2 historic district. The
structures within the visual APE of the tower site consist of small modern residential buildings.
Given the presence of other modern visual elements, adverse effects on the NRHP-eligible
district are not anticipated from the development of the tower site. The La Paloma Cemetery
(Cemetery ID No. CF-C054) (see Photograph B-107) is located northwest of the intersection of
the tower site access road (Main Street) and Military Highway (Highway 281) (see Figure A-10).
No established date is known for the cemetery and it is approximately 0.57 acre in size. It is
unlikely that the access roads will have an adverse effect on the cemetery, as both roads are
preexisting thoroughfares.
6.1.19 HRL Green Barn Road Primary
6.1.19.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 toT1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint during the survey
of the HRL Green Barn Road Primary tower site and its associated access and utility corridor.
The access and utility corridor had an existing road with a 5-ft-high berm on the east side and a
ditch on the west side; both encompassed the entire 60-ft survey corridor and prevented the
excavation of STPs. The access and utility corridor was subject to pedestrian surface

6.1.19.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One aboveground/architectural historic resource (El Calaboz Cemetery [Cemetery ID No. CFC005]), identified by GSRC personal, was recorded within the visual APE of the proposed HRL
Green Barn Road Primary tower site (see Figure A-11). The cemetery (Photograph B-112) is
located 0.41 mile north from the center of the tower site and is a designated HTC. No
established date is known for the cemetery and it is approximately 0.42 acre in size. The
cemetery is surrounded by a 3-ft tall chain link fence. A chain-link gate sits on the west
(primary) side of the cemetery. The tower site is likely to be visible from all points in the
cemetery but would not constitute an adverse visual element. Additional structures in the visual
APE of the tower consist of small residential and commercial buildings.

6.1.20.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 toT1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint during the survey

utility corridor is entirely within a man-made levee, which prevented excavation of STPs. The
access and utility corridor was subject to pedestrian surface inspection. None of the STPs were
positive for cultural material and no archaeological resources were recorded during the survey of
the tower site location (Table 6-19; see Figure A-55).

FORT BROWN STATION AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY

A total of 15 proposed tower sites, along with their associated access and utility corridors, were
surveyed within the FTB Station AOR. One new archaeological resource (41CF229) was
recorded within the FTB AOR. The results of the current surveys are presented below organized
by tower.
6.3.1 FTB Zone 34 Primary
6.3.1.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) within the tower footprint and one STP (T2-STP1) was
excavated along the access and utility corridor where it diverged from the existing road at the
base of the levee. The portion of the access and utility corridor, which runs along the existing
road at the base of the levee, was disturbed within the whole 60-ft corridor and comprised of
imported fill which prevented the excavation of STPs. As a result, this portion of the access and
utility corridor was subject to pedestrian surface survey. None of the STPs excavated were
positive for cultural material and no archaeological resources were recorded during the survey of

6.3.1.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One aboveground/architectural historic resource (Santa Rosalia Cemetery [Cemetery ID No. CFC031]), identified by GSRC personnel, was recorded within the visual APE of the proposed FTB
Zone 34 Primary tower site (see Figure A-18). The cemetery (see Photograph B-180) is located
0.32 mile southeast from the center of the tower site. The cemetery was established in the late
nineteenth century and is approximately 0.70 acre in size. The cemetery contains mausoleums,
coping tombs, and small headstones. The tower site is likely to be visible from all points in the
cemetery, but would not constitute an adverse visual element. Additional structures in the visual
APE of the tower site consist of new residential, new commercial, and small utility buildings,
and farmland.

6.3.2.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint and one STP (T2STP1) was excavated along the access and utility corridor during the survey of the FTB Zone 34
Alternate tower site. The portion of the access and utility corridor, which runs along the existing
road at the base of the levee, was disturbed within the whole 60-ft corridor and comprised of
imported fill which prevented the excavation of STPs. As a result, this portion of the access and
utility corridor was subject to pedestrian surface survey. None of the STPs excavated was
positive for cultural material and no archaeological resources were recorded during the survey of
the tower location (Table 6-32; see Figure A-68).

excavation of STPs. As a result, the access road was subject to pedestrian surface survey. None
of the STPs were positive for archaeological material and no archaeological resources were
recorded during the survey of the tower site location (Table 6-34; see Figure A-70).

The previously recorded archaeological site (41CF216) overlaps with the northern portion of the
access road associated with the FTB Pig Pens Alternate tower site (see Figure A-19). The
archaeological survey of this portion of the access road was limited to the footprint of the
existing road. No archaeological material was noted within the footprint of the existing road, but
known previously recorded concentrations of artifacts and extant historic structures are located
outside of the footprint of the road. As a result, it is recommended that any road maintenance
within this area be confined to the existing road bed. In addition, all vehicle traffic is
recommended to be confined to the existing roadbed.

aboveground/architectural historic resource (Indiana and Southmost Cemetery [Cemetery ID No.
CFC044]), identified by GSRC personnel, was recorded within the visual APE of the proposed
tower site (see Figure A-20). The cemetery (see Photograph B-193) is located approximately
920 ft to the east from the center of the tower site. The cemetery was established in the
nineteenth century and was associated with the Brulay Plantation. It is approximately 4,790
square ft. The cemetery contains small headstones and is surrounded by a chain-link fence with
no gate. The tower site is visible from all points in the cemetery, but given the disance, the
visual effect on the cemetery is not considered adverse. The structures present in the visual APE
of the tower site are residential buildings.
6.3.6 FTB East of Sable Palm Road Alternate
6.3.6.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
STPs were not excavated during the survey of the FTB East of Sable Palm Road Alternate tower
site because of concerns from the landowner and the presence of potential unmarked graves in
the area (see Photographs B-194 to B-201). A previously conducted survey (25399)
encompassed the access and utility corridor and the northern portion of the tower footprint. As
part of that investigation, mechanical scraping was conducted at the Indiana and Southmost
Cemetery to assess if unmarked graves extended into their project area (SH 32 Roadway Project)
(see Figure A-20). The investigation was limited to the area north of the cemetery. No
unmarked graves were recorded within the footprint of the SH 32 Road Project. The tower site

was subject to pedestrian surface survey (see Figure A-72). No archaeological resources were
recorded during the survey of the tower site. Given the presence of a cemetery with possible
unmarked graves, it is recommended that if this tower site location is selected then an additional
archeological investigation be conducted to assess if any unmarked graves are present within the
tower footprint or within the access and utility corridor. This investigation should include
mechanical stripping focused on the areas south and east of the cemetery; an area which was not
subject to testing during the previous archaeological investigation (25399).

west from the center of the tower site. The cemetery is described in Section 6.3.5.1. The tower
site is visible from all points in the cemetery and is close to the cemetery, that construction at

42CF229 (Alaska-A-1)
Site 41CF229 was originally recorded from a surface scatter of historic artifacts within a recently
plowed field. Transect STPs excavated during the initial survey of the area, including one placed
within 10 meters of the surface scatter of artifacts, recorded no subsurface cultural material.
Since no evidence of subsurface material was noted and surface visibly was excellent (95
percent) in a plowed field that had recent rain, the site boundary was delineated by the surface
expression of artifacts alone (see Photograph B-218). The site, as currently defined, measures 30
meters north to south by 17 meters east to west, and has a total site area of 393 square meters
(see Figure A-77). A reconnaissance of an adjacent tree line outside of the current survey area to
the west noted a much heavier concentration of historic material on the surface. As a result, the
main portion of the site may be present within that tree line. The site is situated within the Rio
Grande floodplain. The soil profile from the negative STP excavated within the site boundary
noted a single stratum consisting of a grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay to a depth of 50
cmbgs.
Artifacts recorded at site 41CF229 were all from the surface of the plowed field and included
glass and ceramic artifacts. Glass artifacts recorded at site 41CF229 include one partial solarized
manganese indeterminate finish bottle fragment, seven colorless glass shards, one green/clear
spiral glass marble, one amber curved glass (embossed "A" and eagle motif) shard, one partial
colorless glass external threaded finish bottle fragment, one amber glass basal shard bearing a
maker's mark showing an anchor with an "H", and one colorless bottle base fragment (see
Photograph B-219). The solarized manganese glass dates between 1875 and 1920 (Lockhart
2006). The anchor with an "H" maker's mark represents the Anchor Hocking Glass Corporation
which was in use since 1938 (Toulouse 2011). Ceramic artifacts recorded at site 41CF229
include a terracotta pipe fragment, one black pepper whiteware sherd, and one plain whiteware
sherd. The artifact assemblage suggests the site dates sometime from the late nineteenth to
middle twentieth century.

The 1930 and 1936 East Brownsville, TX 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle depicts a structure
in the vicinity of the site closer to the road, corresponding to the wooded area to the west of the
tower site. By the 1956 East Brownsville, TX topographic quadrangle, the road had been
realigned and a levee had been constructed with the structure no longer depicted.
Given the artifact assemblage and the historic documentation, site 41CF229 probably represents
a late nineteenth to early twentieth century farmstead, located just outside of the survey area to
the west, which was abandoned and razed by the middle of the twentieth century. Given that the
main portion of the site is further to the west and the artifact assemblage from the site is
predominantly modern, the site has little or no potential to provide important information on
historic settlement of the Rio Grande Valley. The site is not recommended eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP under any criteria.

One aboveground/architectural historic resource, the NRHP-listed Palmito Ranch Battlefield
historic district, identified by GSRC personnel, was recorded within the visual APE of the
proposed FTB Gallinas Road Primary tower site (see Figure A-25; see Photograph B-242). The
district is within visual APE and was listed in the NRHP in 1993. The district is significant on
the national level and is a designated NHL. While the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas shows
the boundary of the historic district approximately 510 ft south of the center of the tower site, the
NRHP website from the NPS shows the tower site within the district. Additional consultation
would be needed with the THC to determine which boundary is correct. With the exception of
the highway, a few roads, and a few scattered powerlines, the landscape is untouched. If the
APE of the proposed tower site is located within the boundary of the NRHP-listed battlefield, the
proposed project will have an adverse physical or aesthetic effect on the battlefield, historic
landmark, and historic district. There are no buildings in the APE.

FALFURRIAS STATION AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY

A total of seven proposed tower sites along with their associated access and utility corridors were
surveyed within the FLF Station AOR. No new archaeological resources were recorded within
the FLF AOR. The results of the current surveys are presented below organized by tower.
6.4.1 FLF Dos Haches Hopper Ranch Primary
6.4.1.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint and nine STPs
(T2-STP1 to T2-STP9) were excavated along the access and utility corridor during the survey of
the FLF Dos Haches Hopper Ranch Primary tower site (see Photographs B-251 to B-258). The
tower footprint was heavily disturbed and the location of an abandoned oil and gas well pad (see
Photograph B-259). As a result, the STPs were excavated near the edges of the tower footprint,
in the areas that were estimated to be the least disturbed. An existing hard packed road and
associated drainage ditches encompassed the entire footprint of the 30-ft access road which
prevented the excavation of STPs. Utilities and pipelines on both sides of the access road were
noted for the majority of its length. The access road had good to excellent ground visibility (80
to 90 percent) and was subject to a pedestrian surface survey. None of the STPs were positive
for archaeological material and no archaeological resources were recorded during the survey of
the tower site location (Table 6-44; see Figure A-83).

6.4.4.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One aboveground/architectural historic resource (King Ranch), identified by GSRC personnel,
was recorded within the visual APE of the proposed FLF Adairs Ranch Alternate tower site (see
Figure A-28). The NRHP-listed historic district is located approximately 272 ft to the east of the
center of the tower site. The district is described in Section 5.4.3.3. Because the landscape is
flat and mostly untouched, aside from the highway, the tower site is likely to be visible from all
points in the western part of King Ranch. Additional structures present in the visual APE of the
tower site consist of residential and commercial buildings, and are located on opposing side of
the highway. The tower site will have an aesthetic adverse effect on the district.
6.4.5 FLF Checkpoint Tower Primary
6.4.5.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
The area encompassing the FLF Checkpoint Tower Primary tower location site was previously
surveyed in three separate surveys ([669], [58346], and [61069]) (see Figure A-29). Together
the three surveys completely encompass the tower footprint. The area encompassing the tower
footprint is within the already developed Falfurrias Checkpoint and covered in asphalt and
compacted gravel. Given the hard cover and the fact that the area was previously surveyed,
STPs were not excavated at the tower location. No archaeological resources were recorded
during the survey of the tower site (see Figure A-87).
6.4.5.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One aboveground/architectural historic resource (King Ranch), identified by GSRC personnel,
was recorded within the visual APE of the proposed FLF Checkpoint Tower Primary tower site
(see Figure A-29). The NRHP-listed district surrounds the center of the tower site. The historic
district is described in Section 5.4.3.3. The tower site is visible from all points in the western
part of King Ranch; however, as a result of the presence of previously built towers and buildings
associated with the Border Patrol Checkpoint, the tower site will have no aesthetic adverse effect
on the district.
6.4.6 FLF Checkpoint Tower Alternate
6.4.6.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
The Falfurrias Checkpoint Tower Alternate tower site location is adjacent to the FLF Checkpoint
Tower Primary tower location site. The area encompassing the FLF Checkpoint Tower Primary
tower location site was previously surveyed in three separate surveys ([669], [58346], and
[61069]) (see Figure A-29). Together the three surveys completely encompass the tower
footprint for the proposed tower site location. The area encompassing the tower footprint is
within the already developed Falfurrias Checkpoint and covered in asphalt and compacted gravel
(see Photograph B-271). Given the hard cover and the fact that the area was previously surveyed
for cultural, STPs were not excavated at the tower location. No archaeological resources were
recorded during the survey of the tower site (see Figure A-88).
6.4.6.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One aboveground/architectural historic resource (King Ranch), identified by GSRC personnel,

(Figure A-30). The NRHP-listed historic district is located approximately 1,100 ft to the north of
the center of the tower site. The NRHP-listed King Ranch historic district is described in Section
5.4.3.3. Because the landscape is flat, the tower site is likely to be visible from all points in the
southern part of King Ranch. Additional structures in the APE consist of residential and
commercial buildings, along with previously built vertical structures. Since the visual APE of
the district is already impacted by the presence of existing modern buildings and vertical
structures, the tower will have no aesthetic adverse effect on the district.

6.5.1.2 Historic Resource Investigations
The proposed KIN Highway 77 Armstrong Primary tower site is located within the previously
recorded NRHP-eligible Armstrong Ranch historic district. The existing structures within the
visual APE of the tower site are small modern utility buildings and a few residential buildings.
Given the presence of other modern visual elements, no adverse visual effects on the NRHPeligible historic district are anticipated from the construction of the KIN Hwy 77 Armtrong
Primary tower site.
6.5.2 KIN Hwy 77 Armstrong Alternate
6.5.2.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
While preparing to survey the proposed KIN Hwy 77 Armstrong Alternate tower site, the
landowner reviewed the plans and requested that the tower and its associated access and utility
corridor be moved. As a result, the tower site and its associated access and utility corridor were
not subject to an archaeological survey (see Figure A-91). If this tower is chosen for future
development, it is recommended that the tower site and any associated access and utility
corridors be subject to an archaeological survey.

6.5.3 KIN Juanita Section of Kenedy Ranch Alternate
6.5.3.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
The area encompassing the KIN Juanita Section of Kenedy Ranch Alternate tower location site
was previously surveyed in 1999 (18647) (see Figure A-32). The area encompassing the tower
footprint is within the neutral area between the two lanes of U.S. Hwy 77, just south of a TxDOT
rest stop (see Photographs B-276 to B-283). Given that the area is heavily disturbed and was
previously surveyed for cultural material in 1999, STPs were not excavated at the tower location.
The area was subject to pedestrian survey. Surface visibility was poor (0 to 5 percent) and
disturbance noted across the site including drainage structures associated with the highway and a
buried gas pipeline which cut across the highway and through the middle of the proposed tower
site. No archaeological resources were recorded during the survey of the tower site location (see
Figure A-92).
6.5.3.2 Historic Resource Investigations
No previously recorded aboveground/architectural resources that are listed in the NRHP, or that
are eligible for listing in the NRHP, are located within the visual APE of the proposed KIN
Juanita Section of Kenedy Ranch Alternate tower site and its access road. One OTHM (General
Zachary Taylor [2143]) is located within the visual APE of the tower site (see Figure A-32). The
OTHM does not designate an RTHL and the tower does not constitute an adverse visual element.
The structures within the visual APE of the tower site are a series of rest-stop buildings along
Highway 77.

7.0

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

GSRC personnel conducted intensive pedestrian archaeological surveys at 56 proposed primary,
alternate, and tertiary option tower location sites for the Rio Grande Valley RVSS Upgrade
project. Surveys conducted included both pedestrian survey and excavation of STPs across the
tower sites, as well their associated access and utility corridors. A total of two archaeological
resources (41CF228 and 41CF229) were recorded during the surveys. Another five previously
recorded archaeological resources (41CF167, 41CF208, 41CF216, 41HG215, and 41HG230)
were revisited and updated. Table 7-1 summarizes the eligibility recommendations for the new
and updated archaeological resources identified during this survey. Both of the newly recorded
archaeological sites are recommended not eligible for the NRHP, and no additional
archaeological investigations are recommended for these archaeological resources.

No cultural material or evidence of four of the previously recorded archaeological resources
(41CF208, 41CF216, 41HG215, and 41HG230) was recorded within the current survey areas.
These sites either do not extend into the current survey areas, are misplotted, or have been
destroyed. No further work is recommended for these archaeological resources. One previously
recorded archaeological resource (41CF167) was relocated, but the portion of the site within the
current survey area was heavily disturbed and is not considered to be a contributing element to
the site’s potential eligibility. As a result, it is recommended that the development of the
Galveston Bend Primary and Alternate tower site locations would not have an adverse effect on
site 41CF167.
The aboveground/architectural historic resource survey revisited previously recorded NRHPlisted and NRHP-eligible historic resources, OTHMs including RTHLs, and cemeteries that were
located within the 0.5-mile visual APE of each of the proposed tower sites. Potential adverse
visual effects would occur to two NRHP-listed historic districts (Palmito Ranch Battlefield and
King Ranch), and both are NHLs. In addition, during the consultation process the THC also
requested additional consultation on the BRP FTBGC Primary due to its proximity to the Fort
Brown historic district which is listed on the NRHP and also considered an NHL. Additional

consulatation with the THC, and possibly the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, if
adverse effects can not be avoided, would be required in order to mitigate the potential adverse
effects to these historic properties. One cemetery recorded in the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas is mapped as overlapping with one of the tower site locations. While no graves were
observed within the tower footprint or its associated access and utility corridor, testing should be
done within both the tower site and associated access and utility corridor to determine if
unmarked graves extend into their footprints. In addition, the tower, given its proximity, would
be an adverse visual element to the cemetery. The effect recommendations on the remaining
historic resources visited during the survey of the tower sites are either “No adverse effect” or
“No effect.”
Table 7-2 presents the recommended effects determination for each of the proposed tower sites
surveyed during the current investigation. The effects determination assumes that the entire
proposed tower site and its associated access and utility corridors would be disturbed. For the
purpose of the effects determination, sites with an undetermined eligibility that would be affected
by construction are considered to have an adverse effect, unless mitigation measures are
implemented. Only aboveground/architectural historic resources that are listed, or are eligible
for listing, in the NRHP were considered in determining the effects determinations for each of
the proposed tower sites.
