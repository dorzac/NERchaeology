ABSTRACT
In May 2008, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant) conducted a
cultural resources survey of approximately 13.2 kilometers (km) (8.2 miles) for a new
pipeline following existing right-of-ways between existing water towers in the city of
Nacogdoches, Texas. Cultural resource management was required because the Water
Development Board delegated the responsibility to the consulting engineering company,
KSA Engineers, to contract a cultural resource specialist. Texas Antiquities Permit #4824
was obtained and all terms were carried out. The pipeline was divided into five segments.
Through visual examination and shovel testing, DETAC recorded one prehistoric ceramic
artifact scatter, 41NA306, in Segment 3 within the proposed right-of-way. A total of 15
artifacts were found in four of 13 shovel tests excavated on the site. Unfortunately, the
artifacts are missing; no artifacts were curated. Based on fieldwork, DETAC requests a
determination of “no effect” to historic properties eligible for inclusion to the national
Register of Historic Places.

INTRODUCTION

In April 2008, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant) conducted a cultural
resources survey of a water pipeline between two existing pump stations near the City of
Nacogdoches, Texas (Figure 1). The water pipeline was a replacement line in both new and
existing right-of-ways approximately 13.2 kilometers (km) (8.2 miles) long and 15 meters (m) (50
ft). Both federal and state cultural resource management laws applied because the EPA loan is
administered by the federal government and the City of Nacogdoches is a subdivision of the State
of Texas. The improvements were owned and managed by the City of Nacogdoches. Texas
Antiquities Permit #4824 was obtained and all terms of the permit were carried out. The project
area included 19.8 hectares (ha) (48.9 acres (ac)). One new prehistoric site, 41NA306, was
recorded as a ceramic artifact scatter with 15 sherds in four of 13 shovel tests on the landform.
Based on fieldwork, DETAC requested concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to historic
properties eligible for inclusion to the national Register of Historic Places.
DETAC performed these investigations in compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law [PL] 89-665), as amended in 1974 (PL 97-442), 1976 and
1980; the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL 81-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4321,
1970); Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR 800); the
Archeological Resources protection Act of 1979; and the other appropriate cultural resources
legislation and guidelines. The investigations also complied with the procedural rules of the
Texas Antiquities Code.
All fieldwork was conducted by Victor Galan, Principal Investigator.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The study area for the proposed waterline project falls within the Eastern Timbered Plain
Physiographic Province of east Texas. This province was part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain
(Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG), 1970, 1977) and the Austroriparian biotic province. The
Austroriparian biotic province was typified by extensive pine and hardwood forests, swamps,
marshes, and other hydric communities (Blair 1950).

Geology
The Gulf Coastal Plain was an elevated former sea bottom (Hunt 1974) formed during the
Cenozoic Era when cycles of transgression and regression of the ancestral Gulf of Mexico
deposited sands, shales, clays, and marls in sedimentary geologic formations. More-resistant strata
form escarpments or cuestas with rolling hills and prairies (Fisher 1965). The streams that flow
through these hills and prairies typically had floodplains 1.6 to 16 km (1 to 10 miles) wide. These
floodplains generally occurred 30.5 to 46 m (100 to 150 ft) below the regular elevation of the land
creating narrower floodplains where streams cut through the cuestas.
The geologic units in the area included two units from the Eocene: Weches Formation and
Sparta Sand (Figure 2). One additional unit, Holocene Alluvium, included stream channel, back
swamp, natural levee, and point bar areas (BEG, 1968) along Bonita and LaNanna Creeks. The
Weches Formation underlies the Sparta Sand. Weches was the most resilient thereby forming the
cuestas and ridges common to the area and included glauconitic, glauconitic marl, quartz sand, and
clay with abundant marine mega-fossils. Sparta Sand consisted of very fine to fine grained quartz
sand with lignitic clay and silt. No Quaternary Terrace deposits were identified along the proposed
pipeline right-of-way; however, Holocene Alluvium deposits have the only chance of containing
deeply buried archaeological sites because of the potential of containing recently buried sandy
materials. The other formations are significantly older and more stable consisting of sand and clay
over bedrock. Understanding the Holocene Alluvium deposits and the upland soils impacted by the
proposed relied on the information derived from the Nacogdoches County Soil Survey (NRCS
2006). Soil surveys collect data to a depth of 203 cm (80 inches) or roughly twice the depth of the
planned excavation.

The geologic formations produced two general soil mapping units

documented in the project area (Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS 1980). The

Weches Formation produced a dominantly loamy upland soil that includes the NacogdochesTrawick unit. Sparta Sand produced dominantly loamy terrace soils and the sandy upland soil
primarily of the Lilbert-Darco series that formed on wind-modified old alluvial sediments.
Holocene Alluvium includes Hannahatchee and Tuscosso series.

Paleoenvironment
The Paleoenvironment for eastern Texas is largely dependent on information from
paleontological investigations of extinct flora and fauna as well as fossil pollen grains recovered
from bogs and archaeological sites in central, northern, and west Texas which contain deposits
spanning the past 34,000 years. Little paleoenvionmental information is available from east
Texas because there are few locations sheltered from the environment and the acidic oxisols and
alfisols combined with the repeated wetting and drying often destroy pollen grains (Bryant and
Holloway 1985:54). Given the lack of information about the region directly, only
generalizations and simplifications of the environment are possible relying on data from adjacent
ecological regions.
Beginning in the Wisconsin Interpluvial Period between 33,500 and 22,500 B.P.,
environmental data suggests south and east Texas were at the boundary of scrubby vegetation
and grasslands to the west and deciduous forests to the east (Bryant and Schafer 1977:7; Bryant
and Holloway 1985:44) with a generally cooler and wetter climate than today (Bryant and
Holloway 1985:50). Although the source of the rivers were not glacial run-off, the Texas coastal
plain rivers, e.g., Sabine, were cooler and subsequent discharge into the Gulf of Mexico cooler
reducing the gulf temperature and subsequently reducing the precipitation generated by warm
water close to land and large scale Tropical cyclonic events (Blum and Aslan 2005:182). The
effective moisture during this period was derived from mid-latitude events that, when combined
with the increased moisture, caused soil instability across the region (Blum and Aslan 2005:183).
The Wisconsin Fullglacial Period between 22,500 and 14,000 B.P. was a shift to forests
in the region as vegetation change to more conifer, pine, and spruce trees (Bryant and Schafer
1977:11) in a semi-arid temperate woodland that covered central Texas, the northwestern gulf
coast, and present-day southern Louisiana (Adams and Faure 1997:630, 637). This semi-arid
temperate woodland included significantly cooler and moister summers but winters that were

5

similar to present day temperatures (Toomey et al. 1993:305). Geomorphologiclly, the Sabine
River, like the Trinity, reacted to the drop in eustatic sea level causing valley incision (Ferring
1990:45).
The Late-Glacial period from 14,000 to 10,000 B.P. saw rapid increases in temperature
and associated decrease in effective moisture in three steps at 14,500 B.P., 12,500 B.P., and
10,500 B.P. which correspond with max meltwater discharge in glacier-fed rivers and decrease
evaporation (Toomey et al. 1993:306). The drier weather would lessen the recharge of rivers not
supplied by glaciers, e.g., the Sabine and Trinity rivers, and may have reduced the flow to
braided streams allowing for increased alluvial deposits and more eolian movement of
sediments. What is documented is these warming steps altered animal and plant life in the
region with the return of grass-dominated setting (Bryant and Schafer 1977:14) and caused
widespread landscape instabilities (Blum and Aslan 2005:183).
The Postglacial Period from 10,500 B.P. to present was a continuation of the Late-glacial
Period with temperate grasslands in a savanna setting (Bryant and Schafer 1977:18) that
extended from the gulf coast northward to Canada (Adams and Faure 1997:630, 637). These
conditions of warmer temperatures and drier climate continued until modern times that began
with a more grassland dominated environment around 9,500 B.P. but stabilized then dropped
dramatically between 7,000 and 5,000 B.P. causing animals that required more moisture to leave
the area (Toomey et al. 1993:308). Smaller fluctuations of dry and wet periods continue until
today; however, these changes are relatively short term events that force local changes in
environmental boundaries and the distribution of animals across the landscape leading humans to
adapt but continually thriving and becoming both more populace and more environmentally
specialized.

Soils
The combination of geologic deposits, alluvial geomorphology, and both vegetation and
climate variation over time produced varying soils that reflect the differences in these factors across
the landscape. Soils in the project area formed on the landscape as a result of geology, climate,
floral, faunal, and time. Geology and geomorphological factors provide sediments with particular
chemical and textural characteristics, climate provides energy in the form of temperature and the
precipitation to encourage soil formation, and the floral and faunal resources provide additional
6

chemical and mechanical energy to the landscape as the soils form. With the understanding of the
previous two sections soils are the result of both paleo and modern environments. The results of
these changes are described in the soils information retrieved from the NRCS on-line digital soils
data for Nacogdoches County (NRCS 2006).
Upland soil series include Betis, Bowie, Cuthbert, Darco, Lilbert, Nacogdoches, Ruston,
Tenaha, Tonkawa, Trawick. The upland series formed on Sparta Sand and Wilcox unconsolidated
stratified loamy, sandy and clayey sediments with shallow A horizons over varying thickness of E
horizons dependent on the slope and amount of erosion from farming and logging over the past 100
years. Upland Betis series soils typically include loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam in excess of
203 cm (80 inches). Bowie series soils included 20 cm (7 inches) of fine sandy loam over clay
loam. Cuthebert series soils include 20 cm (8 inches) of fine sandy loam over clay. Darco series
soils typically include loamy fine sand 203 cm (48 inches) deep over sandy clay loam. Lilbert
series soils include 80 cm (33 inches) of loamy fine sand over sandy clay loam. Nacogdoches
series soils include 15 cm (6 inches) of fine sandy loam over clay. Ruston series soils include 25
cm (10 inches) of fine sandy loam over clay loam. Tenaha series soils include 25 cm (22 inches) of
loamy fine sand over clay loam. Tonkawa series soils include fine sand in excess of 203 cm (80
inches). Trawick series soils include 15 cm (6 inches) of fine sandy loam over clay.
Lowland soils include terraces and floodplain series Attoyac, Hannahatchee, Osier
(Naconiche), Rentzel, Tuscosso on floodplain floors and along upland drainages. Attoyac series
soils have 20 cm (9 inches) of fine sandy loam over sandy clay loam. Hannahatchee series soils
include 50 cm (21 inches) of loam and fine sandy loam over sandy clay loam in the Bonita and
LaNanna Creek floodplains. Osier series soils include frequently saturated loamy fine sand in
excess of 203 cm (80 inches) deep. Rentzel series soils included loamy fine sand in excess of 203
cm (80 inches) deep. Tuscosso series soils include clay in excess of 203 cm (80 inches) deep.

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY

The Cultural Chronology was divided into Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Early Ceramic, Late
Prehistoric, and Historic periods.

Each period was delineated by a change in environment,

technology, and/or population requiring adaptations to meet varying circumstances. Each period
was described in reference to the cultural phases within the period, settlement patterns, subsistence,
and artifacts associated with the period.

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian period (prior to 6000 B.C.) was the earliest generally accepted cultural
period in the New World and includes populations that inhabited North America from the Late
Pleistocene to the early Holocene. Paleo-Indian sites were typified by earlier Clovis and later
Scottsbluff, Dalton, San Patrice, and Plainview projectile points, these sites were rare in the
region. Overall, tool types were generally carefully fashioned bifacial and unifacial tools. The
use of non-local materials and recycling lead Story (1990) to suggest this population was
organized into small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of plants
and animals. Paleo-Indian artifacts recovered in the region suggested that early occupations
were principally distributed in the valleys of major stream basins (Perttula 1995). However,
observed sites from the Paleo-Indian period were less frequent in active floodplains because of the
changes in the landscape since those periods (Waters 1992:151).

Archaic
The Archaic (6000-400 B.C.) referred to hunter-gatherers who implemented more
regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment. The Archaic period was
represented by three divisions: the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic during which tool technology
progressed from the large points that typify the Paleo-Indian period to the use of sand and grog
tempered ceramics and the bow and arrow in the Early Ceramic and Late Prehistoric. Later
Archaic sites were more abundant than earlier sites as populations shifted from major streams to
minor streams and natural springs (Story 1990). This greater number and distribution of Late
Archaic sites suggested the successful adaptation to the environment lasting until the development
8

of pottery and/or the development of the bow and arrow. Stone-lined hearths, baking pits, milling
implements, and polished stone served as indicators of new technologies (Story 1990:213). When
compared to Paleo-Indian artifacts, Archaic lithic assemblages are more functionally varied;
however, tool types were generally less well made and of more local materials than the PaleoIndian period. Cemeteries dated to the Archaic period as well (Story 1990). Projectile point types
associated with the Archaic period included Gary, Elam, Edgewood, Ellis, and Yarbrough.

Early Ceramic Period
The Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800) period (Story 1990:293), also referred to as the
Woodland period (Perttula et al. 1986), represented an increasing utilization of the environment. A
number of characteristic innovations appear during the Early Ceramic period. In particular, there
was a greater reliance on cultigens along with larger and more prolonged occupations at specific
locales.

The technological innovation appearing during the Early Ceramic period was the

widespread production of pottery and the introduction of the bow and arrow very late in the period
(Story et al. 1990; Thurmond 1990). Pottery, or at least the surface decorations, were probably
introduced from the Lower Mississippi Valley as Marksville Stamped, Marksville Incised,
Tchefuncte Stamped, Troyville Stamped, and Chrupa Incised. These decorative types were found
along the Sabine River (Story 1990; Thurmond 1988; Cliff and Peter 1994:23) while south of the
Sabine River ceramics are mostly plain sandy paste Mossy Grove varieties (Story 1990). Gary and
Kent projectile points were made smaller and lighter and corner-notched arrow points enter the
archaeological record at this period as well (Thrumond 1990) with a similar split along the Sabine
River having a variety of stemmed arrow points to the south (Perttula 2004:376). Populations
throughout the region were attempted to utilize plant resources along valley margins as sites were
located along increasingly larger landforms and covered larger areas (Corbin 1998:115).

Late Prehistoric Period
The prehistory of northeast Texas in the Late Prehistoric period followed the development
of the Caddoan culture (A.D. 800-1680). This culture was an indigenous development strongly
influenced by the Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990:323; Wycoff
1971). Caddo subsistence and social organization differed markedly from the Archaic and Early
Ceramic periods as horticulture supplemented hunting and gathering followed by a diet dominated
9

by maize, beans, and squash. Increasingly larger aggregates of people became sedentary and
constructed villages with public ceremonial areas.

A stratified social structure developed,

corresponding to the chiefdom level as first defined by Service (1962, 1975).

Extensive

commercial networks were also established with hamlets and farmsteads surrounding larger
community mound center. Settlements were mainly distributed on elevated landforms adjacent to
major streams, as well as along minor tributaries and spring-fed branches. The Late Prehistoric
Period has been divided into Formative, Early, Middle, and Late Caddoan phases. The phases
indicated changes in socio-political, habitation, and material culture. Overall, the Late Prehistoric
Period was typified by a variety of arrow points, ground stone artifacts, and a ceramic vessel types.

Historic Period
The county was named after the town of Nacogdoches, which in turn, was named after the
Nacogdoche Indians, a Caddoan tribe of the Hasinai confederacy. The early Spanish explorers,
missionaries, and settlers found several villages of Caddoan Indians as well as a large Bidai village
in the area of present day Nacogdoches County. In the midst of these villages the missionaries
established the mission of Nuestra Senora de la Purisma Conception de los Hainai on the Angelina
River, San Jose de los Nazonis in the northwestern part of the county, and Nuestra Senora de
Guadalupe de los Nacogdoches supposedly within the modern limits of the city of Nacogdoches.
Lying along the El Camino Reales, the City of Nacogdoches and Nacogdoches County witnessed
several historically important events, including the expeditions of Philip Nolan in 1801, the
Gutierrez-Magee Expedition of 1812-1813, the Long Expedition of 1819, the Battle of
Nacogdoches in 1832, and the Cordova Rebellion of 1838. The City of Nacogdoches was also
largely responsible for supplying forces and financing the Texas Revolution (Webb 1952).
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the town of Nacogdoches was the second largest
city in Texas. The city houses the campus of Stephen F. Austin State University, organized by the
Texas Legislature in 1915. Nacogdoches County remains largely agricultural and produces crops
including cotton, corn, hay and vegetables. Beef and dairy cattle, as well as hogs, are also raised.
The timber and oil industries played a prominent role in the county's commercial enterprises: the
first commercial oil well was drilled in Nacogdoches County (Webb, 1952).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

A review of the official site location maps and files at TARL and the Texas Archaeological
Site Atlas (Texas Historical Commission (THC) 2008) revealed that the pipeline was within a mile
of several cultural resource surveys. Surveys were conducted for several water service related
projects, new roads, and Stephen F. Austin State University Anthropology Department within the
city limits. Examples of these investigations included sewer replacement and construction lines
(Murin 1998; Galan 2001, 2002, 2003), TSDHPT’s (1977) survey along the western extent of Loop
224 and along Highway 59 north of Nacogdoches, and the SFASU survey and assessment of
archaeological sites in the city limits (Corbin 1986). Of these investigations, the survey by Galan
(2003) ended at the southwestern extent of the current project, the survey by TSDHPT crossed the
southern end of the project area, and the survey by SFASU considered many of the areas crossed
by the proposed pipeline as high probability areas.
The closest large-scale investigations were conducted on Washington Square (41NA49)
and the Mast site (41NA157). Excavations at Washington Square were part of the Stephen F.
Austin State University field school between 1979 and 1982 and the Texas Archaeological Society
field school in 1985 (Corbin and Hart 1998). Washington Square was a Middle Caddo Mound
Complex that may have contained up to five mounds according to historic accounts. Excavations
included approximately 270 m2 and selectively placed backhoe trenches over five efforts between
1979 and 1985. Features recorded included post holes, charcoal filled pits, sherd filled pits, pits
filled with various other items, four mounds, a collapsed structure, and several burials. Calibrated
2-sigma radiocarbon dates suggested an occupation between 1250-1350 A.D. (Corbin and Hart
1998). Scientific excavations on the Mast site were conducted in 1987 and 1993 by the Stephen F.
Austin State University field school. The Mast site was found to contain Late Archaic to Early
Ceramic on an isolated ridge overlooking Bonita Creek. Block excavations found few post holes
but did find hearths on the summit of the ridge.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several recent documents have added
significantly to information on the archaeological record in this region. The document of primary
importance is D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain.
Additionally, the Texas Historical Commission, Department of Antiquities Protection developed a
document for the east Texas portion of the Texas State Plan (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). This
11

document included several historic contexts each of which dealt with a particular facet of northeast
Texas prehistory. This plan synthesized the current state of archaeological research in the region
and identified problems and objectives to be addressed in future research and cultural resources
management. Several weak areas in archaeological knowledge of the region were identified in
these recent studies. Chronology, settlement patterns, subsistence, and historic continuities were
some of the general research directions that all of these recent syntheses emphasized as important
for developing future archaeological research designs. Since these publications, the description of
Northeastern Texas Pineywoods by Perttula (2004:370-407) summarizes the investigations and the
current understanding of the region.

SURVEY DESIGN

Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using maps
and files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and at the Texas Archaeological
Site Atlas (THC 2008). The site location maps and cultural resources records at TARL were
consulted to identify the location, types, and both State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and
NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites within or in close proximity to the project areas. The
Site Atlas was consulted for published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys.
To aid in the survey, high and low probability areas were determined by combining the
previous site information with topographic and soils data. Numerous prehistoric and historic
sites were found in previous surveys along the Bonita and LaNanna Creeks outside the project
area.

Based on the previous instigations in the area and other surveys in east Texas,

archaeological sites were more likely to be found on level landforms with deep well-drained
soils near surface water resources as these environments provide dryer conditions for year-round
occupation and necessary water (Galan 1996; 1997). Cultural resources on floodplains are less
frequent unless the site is on a levee or other sandy landform that is smaller than the mapped soil
series as described in Thurmond (1990:217 Figure 29) survey of the Cypress Creek Drainage
Basin. Using these criteria, those lowland areas and the first upland terraces along seasonal
drainages, were considered high probability areas. The final criterion for determining the level
of investigation was established on the amount of previous disturbance. Leveling land for
houses, driveways, and ancillary roads impacted the project area in several locations.
The information gathered from the previous investigations and the soil association data
allowed the survey areas to be divided into high and low probability areas. In general, areas
within the active flood plain have clayey soils while areas outside of the annual flood plain retain
sandy matrix and therefore have a higher probability of containing cultural resources.
Additionally, those areas further from reliable water have a lower potential for containing
cultural resources as prehistoric populations were reliant on surface water. This model suggests
those areas with sandy soils adjacent to reliable surface water have the highest potential for site
development and preservation while sites in seasonally flooded areas are easily destroyed and
few sites will be found further from reliable water sources.

13

The survey was conducted using a visual assessment and shovel testing at roughly 100 m
(330 ft) intervals on the low probability areas with shovel testing at approximately 30 m (100 ft)
intervals and visual inspection on the high probability areas in accordance with the Texas Historic
Commission’s guidelines for cultural resources surveys. The visual assessments were conducted
by walking the proposed pipeline and looking for structural remains and areas of potential high
probably not visible on the topographic maps and inspecting the exposed ground surfaces (recent
utility excavations, slope erosion, cutbanks, and animal disturbances). All shovel tests were
approximately 30 cm (12 inches) in diameter. Shovel testing included excavating in 10-centimeter
(cm) increments to the Bt horizon or to 90+ cm. All excavated matrix was screened through .25inch hardwire cloth.

The depth, soil texture, and color of each shovel test were recorded as part

of a GPS position with 3 to 5 m ( 10 to 16 ft) accuracy.
For each archaeological site recorded, DETAC completed several field procedures.
Initially, the area surrounding the newly located site was intensely inspected and shovel tests were
placed at 10-m to 15-m intervals to define the spatial boundaries and vertical depth of the deposits
of the site. All site locations were collected with a GPS and plotted on 7.5’ USGS topographic
quadrangle maps. All information was recorded on a standard Texas Archaeological Site Form
(TexSite v. 2.0). Field sketch maps were completed for all sites and color photographs were taken
to document the physiographic setting.

All of the photographs were recorded on standard

DETAC/TARL photographic logs. Any artifacts collected were washed, cataloged, and curated at
the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

RESULTS

The Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2008) was consulted for the locations of known
or potential NRHP properties in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
(PL 89-665) as amended in 1974 (PL 94-442) and 1981 (PL 96-515). Nineteen NRHP and six
SAL sites are listed for Nacogdoches County. These NRHP and SAL sites lie outside the project
area. The files at TARL listed 306 previously recorded sites in Nacogdoches County. Of the
previously recorded sites, two were found within 100 m (330 ft) of the proposed pipeline
(41NA166 and 41NA170), four sites were documented up to 500 m (1640 ft) of the project area
(41NA151, 41NA157, 41NA165 and 41NA168) and three sites were documented up to 1000 m
(3280 ft) of the project area (41NA77, 41NA159, and 41NA169).

All nine of the sites listed

above and described below were found during the SFASU Nacogdoches Historical Site Survey
(Corbin 1986).
Site 41NA166, Bonita Junction, was recorded as a ceramic and lithic scatter roughly 50
m (165 ft) east of the proposed pipeline on a small rise in the Bonita Creek floodplain and site
41NA170 was recorded as a prehistoric lithic and historic artifact scatter roughly 120 m (390 ft)
east of the project area on a low ridge overlooking Bonita Creek. Sites 41NA151, 41NA157, and
41NA168 were recorded as Late Archaic to Early Ceramic lithic and ceramic scatters on the
summit of upland ridges east of Bonita Creek. Site 41NA165 was recorded as a lithic scatter on
an isolated knoll west of Bonita Creek. Site 41NA77, the Loop Site 3, was recorded as a lithic
and ceramic scatter potentially eligible for inclusion to the NRHP on a small rise in the La Nana
Creek floodplain. Sites 41NA159 and 41NA169 were recorded as Archaic lithic scatters near
the summit of the ridge separating Bonita and LaNana Creeks.
To describe the survey results, the proposed pipeline was divided into five segments (1
through 5). Each segment was described with its probability of encountering cultural resources,
topographic setting, previous archaeological investigations and sites, vegetation, soils,
disturbances noted in the visual examination, shovel test results, and segment recommendations.
Newly documented cultural resources were described with the segment description.

Segment 1
Segment 1 (Figure 3) is 2.7 km (1.7 mile) long from the water tank at the terminus of the
pipeline to Hwy 7. The proposed pipeline will parallel F.M 225 then parallel a powerline rightof- way to Hwy 7 past a substation south of Hwy 7. The waterline will be inside the F.M. 224
right-of-way crossing several residence and Loop 224. Vegetation includes pasture grasses
along F.M. 225 and the overhead power line right-of-way flanked by mature hardwood forest
along F.M. 225 and recently logged areas, residences, and pasture along the powerline right-ofway. Soils along the right-of way are Darco loamy fine sand along a wide upland ridge.
Previous investigations near the segment include Galan (2003) survey which extended
from the water tank at the end of the current investigations to Lake Nacogdoches and TSDHPT’s
(1977) survey along Loop 224. No sites were found near the project area on either survey. The
closest documented archaeological sites are over a mile away in downtown nacogdoches.
Investigations along Segment 1 included visual examination for road cuts paralleling
F.M. 224 and shovel testing where possible. Investigations along the powerline include visual
examination of exposed soil in rodent and insect mounds and shovel testing at high probability
intervals along the powerline as this section crosses a wide upland drainage with no permanent
water resouces near by. A total of 12 shovel tests were excavated along the segment (Appendix
A). Soils observed in shovel tests ranged from shallow loamy sand along the disturbed area of
F.M.225 to deep loamy sand similar to the described series in the soil survey with 60 to 90 cm of
loamy sand over clay. No artifacts were found during the survey. DETAC is requesting
concurrence with a determination of “no effect to historic properties” for the segment. No
further work is recommended for the segment.

Segment 2
Segment 2 (Figure 4) extends 2 km (1.2 miles) from Hwy 7 northward to F.M. 1680. The
southern 1400 m (4600 ft) was low probability crossing a wide upland ridge and passing through
a neighborhood while the northern 700 m (2300 feet) was a high probability crossing narrower
upland ridges paralleling Mill Branch. This entire segment follows an existing powerline rightof-way with pasture grasses in the right-of-way and mature pine forest with dense to moderate
understory along the entire segment except in the mid-section in the neighborhood. The right-of16

way passes nearby several houses along the southern end and parallels an improved gravel road
adjacent to Mill Branch. Soils along the segment include Darco loamy fine sand on the southern
half and Tonkawa fine sand on the northern half.
Previous investigations were conducted by TxDot in 1981 for an extension of Austin
Street at the northern extreme of the segment; no sites were found during the survey. The closest
documented archaeological sites are over a mile away along Bonita Creek.
Investigations along Segment 2 include visual examination of exposed soil along an
access road that follow the powerline as well as visual inspection of rodent and insect mounds
and shovel testing at high probability intervals near Mill Branch and low probability intervals
south of the neighborhood.

A total of 25 shovel tests were excavated along the segment

(Appendix A). Soils observed in shovel tests were similar to the described series in the soil
survey with 60 to 90 cm (24 to 30 inches) deep fine loamy sand over the Bt horizon. No artifacts
were found during surface inspection or shovel testing. DETAC is requesting concurrence with
a determination of “no effect to historic properties” for the segment.

No further work is

recommended for the segment.

Segment 3
Segment 3 (Figure 5) is 2.8 km (1.7 miles) long from F.M. 1680 to Loop 224 railroad
bridge following existing power line right-of-ways at the northern and southern ends.
Disturbances along the segment include the existing power ling right-of-ways, unimproved dirt
roads, and the city landfill. Vegetation includes pasture grasses along the overhead power line
right-of-ways flanked by mature hardwood forest. The mid section was predominately areas that
were clear cut in the past five years and were now thick with sapling trees, briars, and other
bushes and shrubs. Soils along the segment included Darco, Lilbert, and Tenaha fine sandy loam
along the southern half of the segment in uplands, Nacogdoches fine sandy loam on the upland
slopes and Trawick clay loam and Hannahatchee loam in the Bonita Creek floodplain at the
northern extent of the segment.
Previous investigations near the segment include two surveys by TxDot in 1977 and 1981
for road improvements 370 m west of the segment and a second TxDot survey near the southern
end of the segment for an Austin Street extension. Neither of the surveys documented any
cultural resources. In addition to these defined surveys, the SFASU Anthropology Department

survey for the City of Nacogdoches (Corbin 1986) documented site 41NA166, Bonita Junction,
as a ceramic and lithic scatter roughly 50 m (165 ft) east of the proposed pipeline on a small rise
in the Bonita Creek floodplain at the southeastern corner of the city landfill and site 41NA170
was recorded as a prehistoric lithic and historic artifact scatter roughly 120 m (390 ft) east of the
segment on a low ridge overlooking Bonita Creek. Four other sites found by SFA were recorded
more than 300 m (985 ft) from the segment closer to Bonita Creek. High probability areas along
the proposed pipeline include the toe slopes of upland ridges along Bonita Creek.
Investigations along Segment 3 include visual examination of exposed soil in rodent and
insect mounds and shovel testing at high probability intervals near an upland drainage in the
southern end of the segment, on uplands overlooking the Bonita Creek floodplain, and on areas
not saturated in the Bonita Creek floodplain. A total of 50 shovel tests were excavated along the
segment (Appendix A). Soils observed in shovel tests were similar to the described series in the
soil survey with 60 to 90 cm of sandy loam over clay on the uplands and 20 to 30 cm of sandy
loam along the slopes. Floodplain soils were shallow and clayey except for an isolated ridge.
Site 41NA306 was documented on the ridge.

41NA306
Site 41NA306 is a prehistoric ceramic artifact scatter on the summit of a natural levee
bound on the south by a low lying area with silty soils and water at or near the surface and on the
north by a cut-off chute of a unnamed tributary to Bonita Creek. The confluence of the tributary
and Bonita Creek is 280m (920 feet) to the east of the site and the Bonita Railroad Junction
depicted on the topographic map 630m (2070 feet) to the northeast. Stumps from mature trees
were present but the dominant vegetation was sapling trees with dense understory. Large push
piles were observed east and west of the pipeline centerline and several adjacent areas were
depressed.
The site was initially found in a positive test along the centerline of the proposed pipeline
right-of-way (Figure 6). Positive tests were primarily on the levee while the negative shovel
tests were on slopes and in low lying areas. Shovel tests 63 and 71 contained the most artifacts,
4 and 7 respectively, and were excavated on the highest part of the levee. Four other tests along
the crest were negative. Shovel testing southeast and northwest of the site along the levee were

negative. Vertically, the artifacts ranged from levels 2 through 5 with 10 of the 15 artifacts from
Level 4. The four positive tests were excavated to Levels 6 and 7 to a gradual Bt horizon.
Artifacts included one rim sherd and 14 body sherds all found in four of 15 shovel tests
on the levee and nearby. Two of the body sherds had brushed exteriors and four had incised
lines on their exteriors. All were bone tempered and between 10 and 30 mm in size.
To summarize 41NA306, the proposed pipeline will cross the natural levee and the creek
bisecting the site. This site may be contemporaneous with 41NA166 roughly 120 m to the
northeast as 41NA166 contained one bone tempered sherd and one hammerstone. The pipeline
excavation will impact the site; however, artifact concentrations are limited to four tests with
between one and six sherds per positive test of 15 tests on the site area. The research potential is
low because of scant artifacts in a few tests in an area that was logged repeatedly.

To summarize Segment 3, the absence of cultural resources in other areas is attributed to
modern disturbance from logging and the deep loose sandy soils in the uplands. The one site
documented along the segment is a small ceramic artifact scatter on an isolated landform. Based
on the negative findings along the segment and the ephemeral nature of the site documented
along the right-of-way, DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to
NRHP eligible cultural resources for the segment; no further work is recommended.

Segment 4
Segment 4 (Figure 7) is 1.5 km (1 mile) long paralleling the Southern Pacific Railroad
grade from the Loop 224 railroad bridge to F.M.210. The proposed pipeline will be outside the
railroad disturbance from north of the bridge to south of the railroad bridge for Highway 59.
Vegetation includes mature hardwood forest for the 300 m north of the Loop 224 bridge. The
remainder of the pipeline will be in pasture. Soils along the segment included Attoyac fine
sandy loam near the Loop 224 bridge along the toe slope and Nacogdoches fine sandy loam for
the remainder of the right-of-way along the gradual upland slope.
The closest previous investigations near the segment include two surveys by TxDot in
1977 and 1981 for road improvements 370 m north and 1000 m (3280 ft) to the west. Neither of
the surveys documented any cultural resources. The closest documented site is 41NA151 on the
summit of an upland ridges overlooking the Bonita Creek floodplain. Additionally, Millard’s

Crossing is a property east of Highway 59 and south of the end of the segment. Millard’s
Crossing includes a collection of 15 vernacular architecture houses from the region. None are in
original context but all retain some value in manufacture technique. High probability areas
along the proposed pipeline include the toe slopes of upland ridges along Bonita Creek.
Investigations along Segment 4 include visual examination of exposed soil in rodent and
insect mounds and shovel testing outside the railroad grade areas at the northern and southern
ends of the segment. A total of 16 shovel tests were excavated along the segment (Appendix A).
Soils observed in shovel tests were similar to the described series in the soil survey with 20 to
30 cm of sandy loam over clay. No cultural material was found in the surface inspection or
shovel testing effort. Negative tests are attributed to the shallow nature of the soils and the
disturbance in maintaining a pasture on shallow soils. Based on the negative findings along the
segment, DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to NRHP eligible
cultural resources for the segment; no further work is recommended.

Segment 5
Segment 5 (Figure 8) is 4.3 km (2.7 mile) long from the Southern Pacific Railroad to
pipeline end at an existing water tank along the north edge of F.M. 210. Disturbances along the
west end were limited to driveways, buried phone cables, and existing utility lines adjacent to the
road ditch. In LaNana Creek a tributary stream was diverted from a natural course and parallels
the road berm forcing the pipeline onto the berm. The eastern end has several houses, buried
cables, and water lines similar to the west end. The end of the proposed pipeline is at an existing
water facility perched on sandstone (Figure 7 incert). Vegetation along the right-of-way includes
pasture grasses in the drainage ditch and in residential yards with mature hardwood trees with
moderate to dense understory outside the existing road and utility corridor near pastures. Soils
along the segment include Attoyac, Darco, Nacogdoches, and Ruston fine sandy loam soils on
the uplands with Hannahatchee loam in the Toliver Branch floodplain and Tuscosso clay loam in
the LaNana Creek floodplain.
Previous investigations in the area include a survey by TxDot in 1979 and 1983
extending from F.M. 210 to the south along the east edge of the LaNana Creek floodplain and
along nearby F.M. 2609 east of the project area. Neither survey documented any cultural along

project area upland ridges overlooking the La Nana Creek floodplain near Loop 224 around
Nacogdoches. High probability areas along the proposed pipeline include the upland ridges and
toe slopes on either side of Toliver Branch and LaNana Creek.
Investigations along Segment 5 included visual examination of exposed soil along the
drainage ditch and shovel testing where possible between modern disturbances. A total of 43
shovel tests were excavated along the segment (Appendix A). Soils observed in shovel tests
were similar to the described series in the soil survey with deeper sandy loam soils on the wide
ridge crests and shallower soils along the slopes and clay loam soils in the floodplains.

No

cultural material was found in the surface inspection or shovel testing effort. Negative test
results are due to the disturbance from the road, ditch, buried utility lines, and residential
disturbances. Based on the negative findings along the segment, DETAC requests concurrence
with a determination of “no effect” to NRHP eligible cultural resources for the segment; no
further work is recommended.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The City of Nacogdoches waterline project consisted of five segments (Segments 1-5)
totaling 13.2 km (8.2 miles) of water pipeline construction between existing water towers near the
city of Nacogdoches. Visual examination and shovel tests were employed at required intervals in
designated low and high probability areas. A total of 149 shovel tests were excavated. One
prehistoric ceramic artifact scatter, 41NA306, was recorded in Segment 3. The site is within the
proposed right-of-way; however, with only 15 artifacts found in four tests of the 13 excavated on
the landform, the site does not merit further investigation. Based on fieldwork, DETAC requests a
determination of “no effect” to cultural resources for the proposed pipeline.
Segment 1 parallels F.M. 224 and an existing powerline right-of-way from a water tank
on the southwest portion of Nacogdoches to Highway 7. Visual examination and excavation of
12 shovel tests outside areas severely impacted by the road or modern development found no
cultural resources. Segment 2 continues along the powerline right-of-way from Highway 7 to
F.M. 1688 passing through a neighborhood and three ridges overlooking Mill Branch. Visual
examination and excavation of 25 shovel tests outside areas severely impacted by modern
development found no cultural resources. Segment 3 extends from F.M. 1688. circumvents the
city landfill, and ends at the Loop 224 railroad bridge near Bonita Creek. Visual examination
and excavation of 50 shovel tests were successful in documenting 41NA306 south of the landfill
on an isolated landform overlooking a tributary to Bonita Creek. Site 41NA306 is within the
proposed right-of-way; however, with only 15 artifacts found in four tests of the 13 excavated on
the landform, the site does not merit further investigation. Segment 4 parallels the southern
Pacific Railroad grade from the Loop 224 railroad bridge to F.M.210. Most of the pipeline will
be outside the railroad disturbance except for the northern most section under the Highway 59
bridge. Visual examination and excavation of 16 shovel tests outside areas severely impacted
by modern development found no cultural resources. Segment 5 along F.M. 210 and crosses
Toliver Branch and LaNanna Creek. Most of the segment is disturbed by drainage ditches,
residence, or buried utility lines. Visual examination and excavation of 43 shovel tests outside
areas severely impacted by modern development found no cultural resources.
Based on fieldwork, DETAC requests a determination of “no effect” to cultural resources
for the proposed pipeline for all five segments despite the small prehistoric ceramic scatter.
