ABSTRACT
The City of Temple is replacing and abandoning the existing 15” Bird
Creek Sewer Line with a new 21” line on the west side of Temple in Bell
County, Texas. This project will be done in phases, and the portion of the line
for this study is Phase I. A desktop evaluation and literature review of
Phase I was conducted, reviewed and concurred with by the Texas
Historical Commission on July 15, 2010. The evaluation recommended
that only the portion of the pipeline that crosses through the Early to
Middle Archaic site 41BL308 needed to be surveyed, given the lack of
information available on the site at the time of the evaluation. Site
41BL308 is crossed by approximately 800 linear feet of Phase I. The route
runs along the north side of Bird Creek through the Sammons Golf
Course. This is an active golf course and has been in existence since the
1920s. The purpose of the investigation was to determine if there was an
intact buried archaeological deposit in the alluvium and to make
recommendations on how it will be impacted by construction. Three
backhoe trenches and four shovel tests demonstrated that the route through
the site had been significantly impacted by the golf course. Only six
prehistoric artifacts were recovered, and all came from a layer determined
to be fill. Of the artifacts recovered, one Godley point was found in
Trench 1. This point pushes the occupation of the site back to the Late
Archaic. The testing did demonstrate that there were no buried
archaeological deposits within the ROW and that the area has been
modified repeatedly over the years. The low density of artifacts and the
fact that all were recovered from fill demonstrate intrusive artifacts in a
secondary context. Given the low density of artifacts recovered, lack of
dateable features and disturbed nature of the area, we recommend that the
portion of 41BL308 within the ROW is not eligible for listing on the
NRHP or as a SAL. Based upon the results of the archaeological survey,
AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that the City of Temple be allowed to
construct Phase I of the Bird Creek Interceptor.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Temple is replacing and abandoning the existing 15” Bird Creek Sewer Line
with a new 21” line on the west side of Temple in Bell County, Texas (Figure 1). This
project will be done in phases, and the portion of the line for this study is Phase I. A desktop
evaluation and literature review of Phase I was conducted, reviewed and concurred with
by the Texas Historical Commission on July 15, 2010 (Appendix A and B). The
evaluation recommended that only the portion of the pipeline that crosses through Site
41BL308 needed to be surveyed, given the lack of information available on the site at the
time of the evaluation. Site 41BL308 is situated in approximately 800 linear feet of the
Temple Bird Creek Interceptor Phase I (Figure 2). The route runs along the north side of
Bird Creek through the Sammons Golf Course. This is an active golf course and
according to the original survey report by Frederick Briuer and Carol Kehl (1987:21), it
has been in existence since the 1920s. The project will utilize an 80’ wide right-of-way
(ROW) as the limits of construction, but only a 30” wide trench through the golf course
will be opened during installation. The installation process will try to disturb as little as
possible of the golf course, so that less has to be restored after installation. The City has
contracted with Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. to for the engineering design and
environmental permitting and Jacobs has contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to
conduct the archaeological survey.
The purpose of this survey was to revisit the site 41BL308 and assess its integrity and to
make recommendations about how this resource might be impacted by construction. The
cultural resource investigation was conducted during August of 2010 and was required
because the City of Temple is a political entity of the State of Texas. Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 5721 was issued for the survey. Since Bird Creek contains Waters of the
United States, it falls within the jurisdiction of the Fort Worth District of the US Army
Corps of Engineers. Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic
Preservation Policy Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental
Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as
amended (PL-93-291), the Clean Water Act, as amended (PL-92-500) and the Rivers and
Harbors Act of 1899. The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission not
only will review this report as the State Agency, but also as the Section 106 review
agency.
This report is written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission, and developed by the Council
of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the
natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the cultural history of the
area. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed in the investigation is
then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes with
recommendations followed by the references cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Bell County is situated on the ecotone between the Edwards Plateau in the western
portion of the county and the Blackland Prairie in the east, in which the study area lies
(Diamond, Riskind and Orzell 1987). The eastern part of the county consists of rolling
uplands that are heavily dissected by stream valleys or their remnants (Huckabee,
Thompson, Wyrick and Pavlat 1977). The county is drained predominately by the Little
River and its tributaries which include the Leon, Lampasas and Salado rivers which come
together to form the Three Forks of the Little River. Bird Creek is mapped on both the
USGS map and Soil Conservation Service Soil Map for Bell County as an intermittent
tributary of the Leon River.
The Austin Chalk formation underlies the entire golf course (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1970). As the name suggests, this formation consists of chalk and marls, which
degrade over time to form the Blackland Prairie’s deep clay soils. The study area contains
many of these soils, including the Austin-, Houston Black- and Stephen-Urban land
complexes with 1 to 5 percent slopes (AuC, HuC and SuC). These are shallow to deep
sloping clayey soils on upland ridge tops and along drainage ways (Huckabee,
Thompson, Wyrick and Pavlat 1977: Sheet 29). The remainder of the study area is
situated in frequently flooded Frio silty clay (Fs), which is a deep soil situated in the
floodplain of Bird Creek.
Although situated in the Blackland Prairie, the study area also lies within the larger
Texan biotic province (Blair 1950), which is rich in flora, yet features relatively low
biotic diversity. Forty-nine species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including
deer, raccoon, rabbits and opossum. Vegetation in the eastern part includes tall grasses,
primarily Bluestem and Gramma (Diamond, Riskind and Orzell 1987). Narrow bands of
bottomland forest are confined to the drainages throughout the region. The climate in Bell
County is humid subtropical, and is characterized by hot summers and mild winters.
Paleoenvironmental change is not well documented in the area, but it is summarized by
Prikryl and Jackson (1985:13-14) and is discussed by Henry (1995). Prior to 12,000 B.C.,
the climate of north central Texas was cooler and moister than at present. Between
12,000 and 8,000 B.C., the climate became warmer and this continued to the present, but
with brief mesic periods. It is suggested that the presence of high grass pollen and low
arboreal pollen between 5550 and 1050 B.C. show a drying with a return of arboreal
pollen after 1050 B.C. The later change is similar to today’s environment. High grass
pollen also occurs at approximately A.D. 450 and from A.D. 1550 to 1650, and this also
indicates a drier period. The presence of paleosols between A.D. 1 and 1000 suggest an
increase in moisture during this period with a return to drier conditions after A.D. 1000.

CULTURE HISTORY
Over the past several decades, cultural resources investigations in Central Texas have
varied due to the locations and types of projects being carried out. The following culture
history is derived from the reports Archaeological Testing at Fort Hood edited by Nick
Trierweiler (1996) as well as various other reports from Fort Hood. The temporal
framework includes the five prehistoric periods, to which the historic Native American
and European periods have been added.
Historic European
Historic Native American
Late Prehistoric
Late Archaic
Middle Archaic
Early Archaic
Paleoindian

A.D. 1800 to Present
A.D. 1600 to A.D. 1870
A.D. 800 to A.D. 1600
1,000 B.C. to A.D. 800
3,000 B.C. to 1,000 B.C.
6,000 B.C. to 3,000 B.C.
ca. 9,200 B.C. to 6,000 B.C.

The Paleoindian period ranges from approximately 9200 to 6000 B.C. Numerous Clovis,
Folsom and Plainview points have been found in Bell County and other nearby counties.
The Wilson-Leonard site (Collins 1998) and the Gault site in nearby Williamson County
provide a look into the life ways of the Paleoindians in Central Texas. Additionally,
excavations at the Gault site reveal extensive deeply buried and well stratified
Paleoindian deposits. It is believed that Paleoindians were big game hunters, but recent
research has questioned if that was completely accurate and it is more probably that they
were generalized hunters and gathers.
The Archaic is divided into three periods, the Early, Middle and Late. This period ranges
from about 6000 B.C. to A.D. 800. The separation between the Paleoindian and Archaic
periods is mainly one based upon subsistence change from big game to smaller game and
more intensified use of plants. Recorded Early Archaic sites tend to be single event
occupations. An emphasis during the Middle Archaic is the presence of burned rock
middens for plant processing although hunting continued as the major subsistence
practice. It is believed that the aboriginal population of Central Texas peaked during the
Late Archaic based upon the number of recorded sites. In addition, site type is quite
varied. Bison kill sites, cemeteries, trade for marine shells from the coast and the use of
corner tang knives. Toward the end of the Late Archaic, rock shelters appear to be more
utilized than open campsites.
The Late Prehistoric period ranges from circa A.D. 800 to 1600 and is marked by the use
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. The Late Prehistoric is dominated by the Austin and
Toyah phases. During the Austin phase, ceramics were not common and subsistence was
balanced between hunting and plant gathering. Cemeteries and exotic shell goods
continue to be present. Intergroup warfare was occurring and suggests population
movements and increased pressures in the region. North-south population movements
appear to occur through Texas during the Toyah phase and a major shift to bison

subsistence occurs although, in places, deer and antelope appear to be a major subsistence
source. The use of burned rock middens becomes diminished due to the use of ceramics.
The early years of the Historic Native American Period saw tentative exploration of
central Texas by numerous Europeans (Stabler 1999). The exploits of early explorers
such as Cabeza de Vaca, Coronado, Joutel and de Leon are well known, and most likely
resulted in the first contact between Europeans and Native Americans in Texas, likely the
Tonkawa. However, it was not until the establishment of Spanish missions between 1680
and 1820 that European settlers had any lasting impact on native groups. Spanish
missions were established on the frontiers of European settlement, and were aimed at
Christianizing native inhabitants and forging viable sources of economic enterprise far
from settled areas. The major impact of the Mission Period was the widespread
introduction of the horse to native groups in Central Texas, which allowed them to
expand their hunting territory. Unfortunately, it also allowed such groups as the Apache
and Comanche to raid wide territories and eventually push the native inhabitants out of
Central Texas.
After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government
established the Empresario system in Texas to attract settlers to the region. Realizing that
Spanish citizens were wary of the area due to encroachment by the aforementioned
Comanche and Apache tribes, the Mexican government allotted numerous land grants to
Anglo-American settlers, Stephen F. Austin’s being the first and most notable. Settlement
increased steadily into the 1830s. By 1836, when Texas gained independence from
Mexico, there were 40,000 Anglo-American settlers. These numbers would continue to
steadily grow as Texas gained statehood in 1846, and more and more Americans came to
the state to seek a livelihood, mostly through agriculture.
Although corn, wheat and cotton were the main staple crops in Central Texas, ranching
was the major economic pursuit due to the occurrence of droughts. After the Civil War,
cotton boomed although corn, wheat and other crops remained a fixture of local
agriculture. A population boom to Bell County was created when the Gulf, Colorado and
Santa Fe railroad entered the county in 1881, and established Temple as its headquarters
(Stabler 1999). The Missouri, Kansas and Texas railroad followed in 1882. Between
1880 and the 1920s, a significant number of Germans, Austrians and Czechs immigrated,
adding cultural diversity to the county. An increase not only in the population but the
economy was evident during World Wars I and II. This can be attributed largely to the
creation of Fort Hood (then known as Camp Hood) in 1942, which provided a substantial
boost to the economy. Today, Bell County continues to grow on an economy based upon
agribusinesses, ranching, factories, recreation, tourist attractions and other businesses.
Previous Investigations
As mentioned above, several archaeological surveys have been conducted at Fort Hood
(Skinner, Briuer, Meiszner and Show 1981, 1984; Carlson, Ensor, Miller and Young.
1987; Carlson, Carlson, Ensor, Miller and Young 1988 and others). The result of the
archaeological surveys of approximately 189,000 acres was that approximately 247

8

prehistoric sites were recorded as were 311 historic sites. The prehistoric sites range in
age from Paleoindian to the Toyah phase and site types include lithic scatters, burned
rock middens, rock shelters and camp sites. Cemeteries, trash dumps, 18th and 19th
century residences, wells and other historic site types constitute the historic sites
recorded.
Archaeological testing of 65 prehistoric sites (Trierweiler 1996) resulted in the
recommendation that 36 of the sites were eligible for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places. Further testing was done at 19 prehistoric sites (Mehalchick
Kleinbach, Boyd, Tomka and Kibler 1999) and resulted in the recommendation that 11 of
the sites were eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
Ethnoarchaeological studies (Carlson 1984) were conducted at the W. Jarvis Henderson
site (41BL273) on the fort as well. Based upon the excavation, it was felt that an archaic
lifestyle continued in Bell County as late as 1943, probably due to the absence of
electricity, plumbing and other amenities.
Two other major archaeological surveys have been done for reservoirs. The Belton
Reservoir, which was constructed on the Leon River, Bland Creek and Cowhouse Creek
approximately four miles northwest of the study area, was investigated by Stephenson
(1949). Nineteen prehistoric archaeological sites were recorded in the study area, and 5
outside the study area. Previously, 24 sites had been recorded in the study area, making a
total of 43 sites within or adjacent to the proposed reservoir. Rock shelters, petroglyphs,
burials, lithic scatters, burned rock middens and campsites were discovered. Small
potsherds of East Texas types, a “Spiro type” shell gorget and an obsidian arrow point
were found. Stephenson (1949:4) mentions that A. T. Jackson and students from the
University of Texas excavated a rock shelter at the confluence of Owl Creek and the
Leon River and recovered 24 burials and 100 artifacts. He further mentions that members
of the Central Texas Archaeological Society excavated 33 burials and collected 98
artifacts from a rock shelter on Kell Branch, which is a tributary to the Leon River.
Southwest of Belton, the archaeological survey for the Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir
(Johnson 1962) recorded 11 archaeological sites, many of which contained stratified
cultural deposits. Two sites, the Landslide site (41BL85) and the Evoe Terrace site
(41BL104) were chosen for further testing (Sorrow, Shafer and Ross 1967). The
Landslide site appears to have been occupied during the Archaic; mainly the Early
Archaic but with a short Late Archaic occupation present while the Evoe Terrace sites
appears to have been occupied from the Paleoindian to the Austin focus times. Both sites
contained abundant projectile points, knives, hammerstones, manos, grinding stones,
hearths and lithic debris, all of which indicated a probable short term reoccupation
through time.
Site 41BL264 was recorded by C.J. Jurgens and W.H. Whitsett (Fox and Whitsett 1984)
for the Texas Development of Water Resources during a survey of a waterline linking
Temple and Belton. The site consists of an open terrace occupation recorded near the
confluence of Bird Creek and one of its tributaries. Artifacts include a broad surface
scatter of fire cracked rock (FCR) and lithic debitage. The site was presumed to be a

series of hearths that had been plowed up, indicating that artifacts were present only to
the depth of the plow zone (approximately 30 to 40 cm). The site is within the Austin
Series (AsB) soil association, the A horizon thickness of which is approximately 40 cm
thick before reaching B-horizon subsoil (Huckabee, Thompson, Wyrick, and Pavlet
1997:6-7). This A horizon depth corresponds to the thickness of plow zone impact,
resulting in the destruction of contextual integrity of buried archaeological deposits. No
further work was recommended for this site.
In addition to the aforementioned large-scale investigations, a review of the Texas
Archaeological Site Atlas (TASA) showed numerous pipeline surveys, park studies and
other smaller archaeological investigations have added to the archaeological record of
Bell County (TASA 2010). Many of these have been conducted relatively close to the
study area. The most significant of these surveys is a 1987 survey of the Temple Central
Park conducted by Frederick Briuer and Carol Kehl (1987) of the Archaeological
Laboratory at Fort Hood and the Bell County Archeological Society. Sites 41BL308,
41BL307 and 41BL309 were recorded during the survey of the park, of which the golf
course was already in existence since the 1920s. Site 41BL307 consists of a historic
home site and site 41BL309 is an early dam on Bird Creek that created Lake Polk on the
northern side of the golf course.
Site 41BL308 is described as an open campsite on the north of Bird Creek. According to
Briuer and Kehl (1987), the site may have been a seasonally or infrequently occupied
hunting camp. This assumption was made by judging the varying ages of projectile points
and biface fragments recovered from the surface and from exposures from golf course
construction, as well as from a collection from a local collector who had worked the site.
Briuer and Kehl (1987:18, 20 & 21) do state that no artifacts were recovered in any
shovel tests or backhoe trenches, but that the alluvial terrace on which the site is situated
is up to 1.5m deep. According to the site map in the report, the site boundaries are much
different than what is shown on TASA (2010) (Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5). The site
as mapped by Briuer and Kehl, shows that the site is situated entirely on the north side of
the existing 15” Bird Creek Sewer Line. The site boundaries on TASA show that
41BL308 would extend south of the existing line into the Frio silty clay frequently
flooded (Fs) soil association along Bird Creek. However, the report does not mention this
as a soil type being encountered at the site, but only Stephen-Urban land complex (SuC),
the Austin-Urban land complex (AuC) and Houston Black clay-Urban land complex
(HuC) (Briuer and Kehl 1987:18). The site is described as a surface scatter that measures
130 by 320 meters and consisting primarily of lithic debitage and FCR, along with
Bulverde and Gower points. Briuer and Kehl state that the site dated from the Early to
Middle Archaic period, based on the diagnostic projectile points recovered from the
surface. The site was acknowledged as a significant site at the time of survey because of
the alluvial terrace and possibility of buried deposit, even though none was found in their
testing. Further work on the site, including excavation, was not recommended because
the site was to be preserved in the park, where it would not be disturbed by earthmoving
activities. Yet, Briuer and Kehl did recommend that 41BL308 and 41BL309 be
designated as State Archaeological Landmarks, but no further work has been done at the
site since.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Settlement patterns brought to light by the numerous aforementioned surveys would seem
to suggest that potential for prehistoric and historic archaeology is relatively high.
However, given the heavy disturbance and development of the area, the orientation of the
proposed pipeline largely within the ROW of the previously surveyed existing pipeline,
and the numerous surveys that have been conducted in the general vicinity, the potential
for finding new archaeology is greatly diminished. Additionally, the majority of sites
recorded in proximity to the study area are located outside of the proposed pipeline’s
ROW. As such, further cultural resource studies on the majority of the line would seem to
be superfluous. The exception to this though, is the portion of the proposed pipeline
route, which diverges from the previously surveyed existing route, and runs through site
41BL308. As the site will be disturbed by the open cut for the pipeline, further testing
will be needed to define the vertical and horizontal extent of the site, which was not fully
ascertained during the 1987 survey.
Methodology
The route crosses through approximately 800’ along the southern boundary of the site
and will have an 80’ wide construction easement. Once the survey team arrived at the
golf course and was shown the testing area, it became clear that only a small area was
available for testing, approximately 300’. The field team walked the entirety of the route
in parallel transects spaced 15 meters apart and made notes about the ground exposure,
surface artifacts, soil types and disturbed areas where subsoil was exposed. The eastern
end of the site near contained a large amount of fill and slopes between 10 and 20% for
the fairway construction. Testing was confined to the rough between Fairway #6 and Tee
Box #5 (Figure 6). All testing was done within the no-mow area (rough) of the hole. The
team was also informed that the mowed areas near Tee Box #5 on the west end and
Fairway #6 on the east end contained various underground sprinkler systems.
Photographs were taken throughout the area using a Fuji FinePix JV100 12.0 mega pixel
digital camera. Shovel tests were excavated where possible, in areas with slope of less
than 20 degrees, and were placed an average of 15 meters apart. Shovel tests averaged 30
cm in diameter and the clay soils were inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks
in order to determine if cultural materials were present, while sandier soils were screened
through ¼” mesh. Backhoe trenches were excavated on the western end closer to the
mapped floodplain soils, and were stepped according to OSHA standards. Soil profiles
were described following the procedures developed by Vogel (2002) and photographs
were taken. Soil from the trench walls, floors and backdirt was screened in order to
explore for any artifacts. Shovel test and trench matrices were described on the basis of
texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to identify the specific soil
colors in each test. The shovel test and trench locations were determined with a handheld
Garmin Colorado 400t GPS unit.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into two sections with the description of the study area followed
by the survey results. Shovel tests and trenches will be described briefly within the text
and are detailed in Tables 1 and 2. The conclusions end the chapter.
Study Area
Since mechanical trenching and shovel testing was confined to the rough along the
fairway for hole #6 of the golf course, there was very little variation of the terrain within
in this 300’ area (Figure 7). A large pecan tree on the north and several large pecans trees
on the south along Bird Creek border the route (Figure 8). The study area consisted of
ankle-high grass. Ground visibility on the eastern end near the fairway was 30 to 75%
and sloped to the west. Bird Creek was slowly flowing at the time, and the channel had
been eroded down to the bedrock (Figure 9). The channel was approximately 3 to 5 m
wide. The south bank was contained approximately 1 to 1.5 m of sediment above the
bedrock, while the north bank was between 2 and 2.5 m high. Ground visibility in the
area west of the large lone pecan on the north was between 0 and 20%.

Survey Results
Shovel testing was conducted at the base of the slope from Fairway #6 west to the large
pecan on the northern side (Figure 7). The first layer of all four shovel tests contained a
very dark gray or brown silty clay or clay (Table 1). This level also contained pea to golf
ball sized limestone gravels and numerous snail shells (rabdotus), which appeared to be a
fill layer. The second layer in all four-shovel tests was very dark grayish brown silty clay
or clay. Calcium carbonate made up 3-5% of the samples and gravels disappeared.
Shovel test 1 (ST1) was excavated to 150 cm below the surface (cmbs) to explore for
bedrock, but it was not reached. Level 3 of ST1 was brown silty clay with increased
calcium carbonate. ST2 was excavated below 100 cmbs into dark gray silty clay with
increased calcium carbonate. Shovel tests 1 through 3 were all positive for cultural
materials, however ST2 and ST3 demonstrate that the area has been modified heavily
over the years it has been a golf course. In Level 4 of ST2, a single interior flake was
recovered, and then in Level 5 a small piece of brown plastic was recovered. In ST3, a
small interior flake was recovered from Level 3, above a piece of clear glass recovered
from Level 4.

Trenching was conducted between the large pecan and the mowed area next to Tee Box
#5 in the rough (Figure 7). Three trenches were excavated to bedrock. Trench 1 (T1) was
excavated 12 m north and parallel to Birds Creek and was located on the far west end of
the study area (Figure 10). The trench was 10 m long and reached bedrock at 60 cmbs.
The top horizon was brown silty clay with limestone gravels. Given the large amount of
gravels in this layer, it was identified as a fill layer used to modify the layout of the golf
course over the years. The B-horizon was pale brown silty clay with calcium carbonate
and approximately 50% limestone gravels, probably trickling down from the top horizon.
In the southern wall of the eastern end of the trench, a Godley point was recovered on the
first step approximately 30 cmbs (Figure 10). The point is side notched with a flat base
and dates to the Late Archaic. This point extends the occupation age of the site from the
Early Archaic to the Late Archaic. The point is 5.3 cm long by 2.9 cm wide and is
probably manufactured of local Edwards Chert (Tim Perttula, Personal Communication
2010).

T2 was excavated east of T1 in roughly the same orientation approximately 10 m north of
Bird Creek. The trench was 9 m long and reached bedrock at 83 cmbs. The top horizon
was a similar fill level of very dark gray clay with limestone gravels. The B-horizon was
brown silty clay with limestone gravels and calcium carbonate. Towards the center of the
trench it became apparent that the trench intersected a previous trench. The disturbance
was a mixture of the surrounding sediment horizons in a rectangular shape. Upon
reviewing Briuer and Kehl’s map, it was determined, that T2 has probably intersected
their Trench 5 (Figure 11). They reached bedrock at 185 cmbs and had water seepage.
Their description for Trench 5 was similar to the profile taken in T2, except that they note
three slightly different light gray horizons. However, their descriptions of limestone
gravels and calcium carbonate is consistent with what was found during this survey. Two
modern artifacts were recovered from this trench. The first was a bone fragment,
recovered from screening the backdirt of the trench. The bone was identified as a juvenile
pig vertebra. The bone has a straight flat edge one side that has been cut by a saw. The
saw marks are apparent in Figure 12. The second artifact was a fragment of a cut
limestone brick. The fragment represents a corner piece and only three sides represent the
original surface. Saw marks are apparent on one side (Figure 13). These evenly spaced
saw marks were probably purposefully left to act as extra grip for the mortar or cement
that would have been use in the construction. No prehistoric artifacts were recovered in
this trench.

T3 was excavated farther east of the first two, towards the top of a small rise in elevation
above Bird Creek. The trench was excavated perpendicular to the creek channel and was
5.5 m long by 2 m wide. The friable bedrock was reached at 140 cmbs. The top horizon
contained fewer gravels than the previous, but was similar to T2 with very dark gray clay.
The B-horizon was gray silty clay with larger calcium carbonate nodules, as well as
limestone gravels. A heat-treated chert flake was recovered from 50 cmbs. The secondary
flake contained some cortex and numerous heat spalls. No other artifact was recovered
from the trench.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL TESTING OF SITE 41BL308

Conclusions
Mechanical and manual subsurface testing revealed only ephemeral evidence of
prehistoric occupation and nothing was found in primary context (Table 3). From four
shovel tests and three trenches, only six prehistoric artifacts were recovered. The single
datable artifact recovered was a Late Archaic Godley point. This is later than the points
previously recovered, which date the site from the Early to Middle Archaic. This point
certainly extends the occupation, yet still fits with Briuer and Kehl’s original conclusion
that the site was a seasonally occupied open campsite. According to the site map in
Briuer and Kehl’s report, 41BL308 was situated on the northern side of the existing 15”
sewer line and mostly out of the ROW of the current project. This is a more probable
location for the site, since it would be well out of the floodplain.
The subsurface testing did demonstrate that there are no buried cultural deposits within
the ROW and that the area has been modified repeatedly over the years. Additionally, all
of the original subsurface testing was negative and all artifacts recovered by Briuer and
Kehl or the collector came from the surface. Trenching and shovel testing demonstrate
that the area has been churned up significantly as to put modern artifacts below the
prehistoric artifacts. The first level of all trenches and shovel tests was determined to be
fill, given the large amount of limestone gravels in the layer, which taper off with depth
before increasing just above bedrock. Testing also demonstrated that in the area where
the pipeline will be installed contained no archaeological features or concentrations of
artifacts. The low density of artifacts and the fact that all were recovered from fill
demonstrate intrusive artifacts in a secondary context. Given the low density of artifacts
recovered, lack of identifiable archaeological features and disturbed nature of the area,
we recommend that the portion of 41BL308 within the ROW is not eligible for listing on
the NRHP or as a SAL.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Given the low density of artifacts recovered, lack of identifiable archaeological features
and disturbed nature of the area, we recommend that the portion of 41BL308 within the
ROW is not eligible for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL. Based upon the results of the
archaeological survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that the City of Temple be
allowed to construct Phase I of the Bird Creek Interceptor through 41BL308. We further
recommend that if buried cultural materials are encountered during construction, works
should stop in that area and the Texas Historical Commission should be notified
immediately.

Mr. Ed Baker
Texas Historical Commission
PO Box 12276
Austin, TX 78711
Dear Mr. Baker,
The City of Temple, Texas, which is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, is
proposing to replace the existing Bird Creek Sewer Line with approximately two miles of
new line on the west side of Temple in Bell County, Texas(Attachment 1). Though the
area is mapped as on the 1965 7.5’ USGS map (which was photo-revised in 1993) as
relatively undeveloped an undisturbed, a number of developments have taken place in the
area (Attachment 2). These include the construction of a public golf course, and
numerous business and residential structures. The project will be located north of IH 35
entirely within the City of Temple, and the majority of the route runs through the public
golf course. The route will start on the north side of Hwy 53 and run southwest, crossing
FM 2305, and then enter the golf course. The route will then continue southwest, crossing
the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railroad line, before terminating at IH 35. The
project includes a waterline that ranges from 15 to 24 inches in diameter, which will be
placed at depths of between 6 and 20 feet. The project will be conducted within a 100foot new and existing right-of-way (ROW), which overlaps or closely parallels the
existing sewer line. This will be done as part of the Temple Bird Creek Interceptor Phase
I project (Attachment 3). Funding for the project is from the City of Temple.
AR Consultants, Inc. was contracted by Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. to perform an
evaluation of archaeological potential within the above referenced project area.
The proposed sewer line location is situated in an upland Blackland Prairie setting and
roughly parallels Bird Creek near its headwaters. Bird Creek is a first-order, intermittent
tributary of the Leon River. Soils present on the route include the Austin-Urban land
complex with 1 to 5 percent slopes (AuC), a gently sloping soil group found on broad
ridgetops and slopes; frequently flooded Frio silty clay (Fs), a floodplain soil found in
lower elevations; the Houston Black-Urban land complex with 1 to 5 percent slopes
(HuC), a gently sloping soil group found on divides an along draingeways; and the
Stephen-Urban land complex with 1 to 6 percent slopes (SuC), a gently sloping to sloping
soil group found primarily in Temple. The underlying geology along the route is Austin
Chalk, which consists of chalk and marl, and has a thickness between 150 and 300 feet.

The soils are fairly shallow over the bedrock, ranging in depth from 12 to 80 inches (0.3
to 2 meters). The deepest soils are confined to the Bird Creek floodplain.
A query of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas for the Temple and Belton, TX 7.5’
USGS maps located five sites within one mile of the proposed pipeline route (Attachment
4). The first is site 41BL180 which is located approximately 0.7 miles north of the study
area above Adams Avenue, is an open prehistoric campsite recorded by Bill Moore of
Texas A & M University in 1977. The site features an extensive artifact assemblage
recovered in a shallow midden deposit, which includes flakes, pottery, bifaces, an arrow
point, dart points, bone, a hammerstone, possible cores, limestone spalls and fire cracked
rock (FCR). Site 41BL264 was recorded by C.J. Jurgens and W.H. Whitsett for the Texas
Development of Water Resources in 1982 during a survey of the existing sewer line that
will be replaced. The site consists of an open terrace occupation site recorded near the
confluence of Bird Creek and one of its tributaries. Artifacts include a broad surface
scatter of FCR and lithic debitage. The site was presumed to be a series of hearths that
had been plowed up, indicating that artifacts were present only to the depth of the plow
zone (approximately 30 to 40 cm). No further work was recommended for either of these
sites.
Sites 41BL307 through 41BL309 were recorded by Frederick Briuer and Carol Kehl of
the Archaeological Laboratory at Fort Hood and the Bell County Archeological Society
during a 1987 survey of the Temple Central Park, through which the proposed pipeline
route runs. 41BL308 is an open campsite situated on the north bank of Bird Creek, which
the recorders suggested may have been a seasonally or infrequently occupied hunting
camp. This assumption is made judging by the varying age of numerous projectile points
and biface fragments recovered from the occupation zone, which is possibly as deep as
1.5 meters, as ascertained by backhoe trenches excavated at the time of survey. A very
large surface lithic scatter, measuring 130 by 320 meters and consisting primarily of lithic
debitage and FCR, accompanied the stratified occupation zone. Briuer and Kehl
suspected that the site dated to the Early to Middle Archaic period, judging by diagnostic
projectile points recovered in the midden. The two remaining sites are historic, and
consist of a home site (41BL307) and early dam implements on Bird Creek (41BL309).
Though Briuer and Kehl recommended no further work be done on the three sites, site
41BL308 was acknowledged as a significant site at the time of survey. Further work on
the site, including excavation, was not recommended due to the fact that the site would be
preserved in the park, where it would not be disturbed by earthmoving activities.
In addition to archaeological sites, the Hodge Cemetery (BL-C050) and two National
Register properties (The Ralph, Sr. and Sunny Wilson House-Atlas No. 98001374 and
the Barclay-Bryan House-Atlas No. 84001572) are located within one mile of the
pipeline route. However, all three are located south of IH 35, and will not be disturbed
during construction. A review of the 1916 Bell County Soils map (georeferenced using
ArcGIS 10) showed structures near, but not in, the pipeline ROW (Attachment 5).
Settlement patterns brought to light by the numerous aforementioned surveys would seem
to suggest that potential for prehistoric and historic archaeology is relatively high.

However, given the heavy disturbance and development of the area, the orientation of the
proposed pipeline largely within the ROW of the previously surveyed existing pipeline,
and the numerous surveys that have been conducted in the general vicinity, the potential
for finding new archaeology is greatly diminished. Additionally, the majority of sites
recorded in proximity to the study area are located outside of the proposed pipeline’s
ROW. As such, further cultural resource studies on the majority of the line would seem to
be superfluous. The exception to this though, is the portion of the proposed pipeline route
which diverges from the previously surveyed existing route, and runs through site
41BL308. As the site will be disturbed by the open cut for the pipeline, further testing
will be needed to define the vertical and horizontal extent of the site, which was not fully
ascertained during the 1987 survey. This will be achieved by the excavation of backhoe
trenches along the proposed pipeline’s route through the site. AR Consultants, Inc. seeks
the Texas Historical Commission’s concurrence with this assessment.
Sincerely,
