Abstract
Archeologists from aci consulting conducted a cultural resources survey for the
Berry Creek Wastewater Interceptor project located in Williamson County, Texas.
The City of Georgetown is proposing to construct 2.9 miles (4.6 kilometers) of
wastewater interceptor, ranging in diameter from 30 to 36 inches (76 to 91
centimeters), from the existing Berry Creek Lift Station to the existing Sun City Lift
Station. The alignment of the interceptor will generally follow Berry Creek from
Airport Road west to the end of Stetson Trail. The purpose of the project is to
divert flows in excess of the Sun City force main and gravity line to the Berry
Creek wastewater treatment plant. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the
cultural resources survey consists of a 50-foot (15-meter) Right-of-Way along 2.9
miles (4.6 kilometers) of proposed wastewater interceptor. This totals
approximately 17.5 acres (7.08 hectares) of linear survey.
This investigation consists of an intensive archeological survey of the proposed
Berry Creek Wastewater Interceptor pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code
(13 TAC 26.20[2]) under Permit #7465. Because of the proximity to Berry Creek,
Section 106 compliance for Section 404 of the Clean Water Act will apply as well.
The overall investigation includes pedestrian survey, photography, site recording,
basic archival research and National Register of Historic Places and State
Antiquities Landmark (SAL) eligibility assessment, data analysis, and report
preparation in accordance with Texas Historical Commission and Council of Texas
Archeologists standards. Julie Shipp served as Principal Investigator.
No archeological sites or other historic properties were located within the APE.
Based on these results, no further archeological investigations are recommended.

INTRODUCTION

The City of Georgetown is proposing to consist the Berry Creek Wastewater
Interceptor project located in Williamson County, Texas. The project consists of
2.9 miles (4.6 kilometers) of wastewater interceptor, ranging in diameter from 30
to 36 inches (76 to 91- centimeters), from the existing Berry Creek Lift Station to
the existing Sun City Lift Station. The alignment of the interceptor will generally
follow Berry Creek from Airport Road west to the end of Stetson Trail. The
purpose of the project is to divert flows in excess of the Sun City force main and
gravity line to the Berry Creek wastewater treatment plant. The Area of Potential
Effect (APE) for the cultural resources survey consists of a 50-foot (15-meter)
Right-of-Way (ROW) along 2.9 miles (4.6 kilometers) of proposed wastewater
interceptor. This totals approximately 1.7 acres (.68 hectares) of linear survey
(Figures 1 and 2).
This investigation consists of a cultural resources survey of the proposed Berry
Creek Wastewater Interceptor pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code (13
TAC 26.20[2]). Because of the proximity to Berry Creek, Section 106 compliance
for Section 404 of the Clean Water Act will apply as well. The overall
investigation includes pedestrian survey, photography, site recording, basic
archival research and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and State
Antiquities Landmark (SAL) eligibility assessment, data analysis, and report
preparation in accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) standards.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The APE is located along Berry Creek, west of Interstate Highway (IH) 35 and
north of Georgetown, Texas. The area is characterized by rolling hills and
limestone outcrops. Berry Creek has a rocky bed and intermittent limestone
bluffs, and is a tributary to the San Gabriel River. The confluence of Berry Creek
and the San Gabriel River is approximately four miles to the southeast.
2.1

Environmental Setting

The APE is located in central Texas in the south end of the Lampasas Cut Plain.
The Lampasas Cut Plain is characterized by rolling hills bisected by the Brazos
River and its tributaries to form broad, shallow valleys. In this region, the hills
provide approximately 100 feet (30 meters) of relief along the creeks. Karst
features including sinks, caves, and rock shelters are present but not common
(Collins and Mear 1998).
The Blackland Prairie lies directly east of the APE on the eastern side of the
Balcones Escarpment, a fault zone with hills to the west and north and low relief
to the east and south. The Blackland Prairie supports prairie vegetation along
with small woods often found along low-gradient streams. The Edwards Plateau
is located just to the west of the project area. This region differs from the
Lampasas Cut Plain in that the stream cut valleys are more deeply incised.
Springs, karstic sinks, caves, and rock shelters are characteristic of the region
(Collins and Mear 1998).
Prehistoric and historic peoples living in the region would have had access to
resources of the Blackland Prairie and Edwards Plateau in addition to Lampasas
Cut Plain resources. The diversity of biotic resources found in this ecotonal
region would have been high. In addition, there is access to reliable water
sources as well as chert for making stone tools (Collins and Mear 1998).
2.2

Soils

Soils in this area are classified as Eckrant Association, an association composed
of shallow, stoney, and clayey soils formed from indurated fractured limestone
or limy earth. Three soil series are mapped within the APE, Oakalla, Eckrant, and
Georgtown (NRCS 2015) (Figure 3). These soils are all Mollisols that formed
within Cretaceous limestone. The Georgtown and Eckrant series soils are
4

aci Project No. 30-14-028

shallow, rocky upland soils. The Oakalla is an alluvial soil but the creek valley is
quite narrow and channelized, and the surface geology is mapped as Edwards
Limestone (Barnes 1974); therefore, the probability of deeply buried cultural
deposits along the creek is low.
2.3

Geology

The geology of the region typically includes the Georgetown Formation
overlying the Edwards Limestone Group that interfingers with the Comanche
Peak Formation in Williamson County. These rocks are underlain by the Walnut
Formation, which has members including the Keys Valley Marl Member, the
Cedar Park Member, the Bee Cave Member, and the Bull Creek Member. Below
the Walnut Formation is the Glen Rose Formation, another marine limestone that
is a major groundwater source in the region (Barnes 1974).

LITERATURE REVIEW

A literature review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (the Atlas) indicated
that no sites have been previously recorded within the APE. However, four sites
have been recorded within one kilometer of the APE (Figure 4). The sites are all
prehistoric campsites, and sites 41WM1184 and 41WM1187 contained human
burials. The NRHP-eligibility status for site 41WM1184 remains undetermined,
but site 41WM1187 has been determined eligible for listing on the NRHP. Site
information is summarized in Table 2.

Avoidance or
mitigation

Site 41WM796 is also known as the Cutbank Site, as it was located in the cut bank
of Berry Creek. The site is a prehistoric open campsite that was recorded by Lone
Star Archeological Services in 1993 for the Del Web Georgetown Project. The
NRHP-eligibility of the site is undetermined. The report was not available on the
Atlas.
Site 41WM911 is a prehistoric campsite that was recorded by Paul Price and
Associates for the Williamson County Raw Water Line in 1997 (Schroeder et al.
1998). The site was subsequently tested by Paul Price and Associates because the
site could not be avoided during construction of the project. The site was found

to lack contextual integrity, and was determined ineligible for listing on the
NRHP (Schroeder et al. 2001).
Site 41WM1184 is a multicomponent open campsite with at least one
disarticulated, expedient burial that was recorded by a private landowner in
1994. It is on the south side of Berry Creek. The NRHP-eligibility for the site is
undetermined.
Site 41WM1187 is an Archaic campsite and midden complex that was recorded
by Horizon Environmental for the development of the Three Forks neighborhood
in 2007. Artifacts at the site include Darl points, a metate, three manos, a thin
biface, a blank fragment, spoke shaves, flakes, and burned rock. There were
numerous burned rock middens at the site as well. The site was tested by
Horizon Environmental in 2008. In addition to the cultural features already
known, four burials were located during the testing excavations (Peyton and
Brownlow 2008). The site has thus been determined eligible for listing on the
NRHP.

METHODS

The specific tasks for the cultural resources survey were:
Task 1: After a review of the current archeological sites data and historical
topographic maps, a 100% pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted to locate
any archeological or historical sites that may be adversely affected by
construction of the wastewater interceptor.
Task 2: All prehistoric and historic sites encountered were to be recorded and
assessed for eligibility for inclusion on the NRHP or for listing as SALs. All site
forms were to be submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Although, no sites were recorded.
The APE consists of a 50-foot (15-meter) ROW along 2.9 miles (4.6 kilometers) of
proposed wastewater interceptor. Given the shallow soils mapped within the
APE, the need for shovel testing was not anticipated to be necessary. This was
confirmed in the field. Limestone outcrops were common in the uplands. The
soil in the Berry Creek flood plain is Oakalla, which is a deep, well-drained soil
that formed in loamy alluvium derived from limestone of Cretaceous age.
However, the soil was mostly eroded and shallow, or disturbed by residential
development and the development of the Berry Creek Country Club.
Field forms include daily journals and photograph logs. All paperwork and
photographs will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL). No artifacts were collected and thus will not require curation.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION

On February 24 and 25, and again on March 14, 2016, archeologists from aci
consulting conducted a pedestrian survey of the APE for the Berry Creek
Wastewater Interceptor. The APE follows Berry Creek and crosses the creek five
times. The creek bed consists of limestone boulders and with limestone bluffs
one either side of the creek.
At the northwest end, the APE crosses the creek and then runs along the
southern terrace of the creek. This area has been significantly altered by the
construction and clearing of vegetation for a walking trail, and the ground
surface visibility was good (Figure 5), so no shovel tests were dug along the
northern portion of the APE.

west.

As the line turns south, there appeared to be some intact soil on the west side of
the creek, within a natural levee and ground surface visibility ranged from 10-30

percent. The area was open and grassy. Four shovel tests were excavated along
this stretch of the APE (Figures 6 and 7), in locations where ground surface
visibility was poor.

As the APE beings to extend to the southeast, bedrock limestone outcroppings
became more common, and the ground surface visibility returned to over 30
percent, as it was on the northern end of the APE. The APE crosses the creek as it
turns west. The south side of the creek is a limestone bluff. Site 41WM1184 is
located at the top of this bluff. The site is an open prehistoric campsite that
contained a possible burial. Because the site is on the south side of the creek,
outside of the APE, and nothing was observed from the APE, no attempt was
made to relocate the site (Figure 8).

Figure 8. Photograph of the approximate location of site 41WM1184 from the
APE, facing southwest.
From this point, the APE is mostly within Berry Creek until Shell Road. The
creek bed is rocky, containing primarily limestone boulders (Figure 9). On the
west side of Shell Road the APE crosses to the north side of the creek. Limestone
outcrops remain common and the terrain slopes gently toward the creek (Figure
10).
As the APE crosses to the south side of the creek again, it enters the Berry Creek
County Club golf course. The terrain in this area has been significantly altered
14

for the construction of the golf course. The APE parallels a sidewalk (Figure 11)
and crosses several sand pits before exiting the country club property and
crossing the creek again between Oak Tree Drive and Champions Drive.
The southernmost portion of the APE is on the north side of the creek along an
existing water line (Figure 12). The southern terminus is at Airport Road, where
the old historic bridge across Berry Creek still remains, parallel to the newer
bridge (Figure 13). The bridge will not be affected by the construction of the
proposed waterline, nor will there be any visual impacts after the construction.
The bridge is outside of the APE.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Archeologists from aci consulting conducted a cultural resources survey of the
proposed Berry Creek Wastewater Interceptor project for the City of
Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas, on February 24 and 25 and on March 14,
2016. The project will involve the construction of 2.9 miles (4.6 kilometers) of
wastewater interceptor, ranging in diameter from 30 to 36 inches (76 to 91
centimeters), from the existing Berry Creek Lift Station to the existing Sun City
Lift Station. The APE for the cultural resources survey consisted of a 50-foot (15meter) ROW along 2.9 miles (4.6 kilometers) of proposed wastewater interceptor.
This totals approximately 17.5 acres (7.08 hectares) of linear survey.
The investigation consisted of a pedestrian survey augmented by four shovel
tests, and did not result in the location of any new archeological sites or other
historic properties. Based on these results, no further archeological work is
recommended. If any cultural resources are observed during the course of
construction for this project, the City of Georgetown and/or CDM Smith are
advised to contact a professional archeologist.
