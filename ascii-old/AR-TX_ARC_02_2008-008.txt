ABSTRACT

In late January of 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey of approximately 1,300 feet of the
proposed Whites Branch Effluent Pipeline Route located approximately
3.2 miles northeast of Roanoke in Denton County, Texas. The proposed
pipeline route is located north of Dunham Road. The survey was done for
Alan Plummer Associates, Inc. acting as agent for the Trinity River
Authority. The survey was done under Texas Antiquities Permit Number
4782.
A records check failed to discover any listed sites in the study area and an
intensive pedestrian survey and 3 shovel tests did not discover any cultural
resources. Based on the field investigation, it is AR Consultants’
recommendation that no further cultural resource investigations are
warranted. The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission
should be advised if buried cultural resources are uncovered during
construction, and, if found, construction should cease immediately in that
area until proper investigations can be carried out.

INTRODUCTION
The Trinity River Authority intends to construct approximately 3.36 miles of the Whites
Branch Effluent Interceptor Pipeline and Outfall Structure route in Denton County. The
proposed pipeline route begins about 1.78 miles northeast of Roanoke at the Denton
Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant and proceeds southeast to the railroad. The route then
turns northeast for a short distance and then back southeast and will be bored beneath the
Union Pacific railroad and US 377. East of US 377, the route continues northeast
paralleling the abandoned Schooling Road across Denton Creek and its floodplain. After
crossing the floodplain, the route turns east and parallels Dunham Road. The route then
turns north and terminates north of the road where it will empty into an intermittent
tributary to Whites Branch (Figure 1). The survey was done for Alan Plummer
Associates, Inc. which is doing the environmental permitting for the Trinity River
Authority.
AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd and Skinner 2003b) conducted an archaeological survey of a
pipeline route across Denton Creek and its floodplain immediately west of the study area.
Based upon the amount of disturbance from previous quarrying and earth moving
activities documented during that survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommended that the
portion of the pipeline route across Denton Creek and its floodplain and the portion of the
pipeline route adjacent to Dunham Road need not be surveyed, but that the portion of the
proposed pipeline route north of Dunham Road needed to be surveyed. The Texas
Historical Commission agreed in a letter dated July 23, 2007. The surveyed portion of the
pipeline route is drawn in red on Figure 1.
The purpose of this investigation was to locate any cultural resources present within the
surveyed route and make recommendations about their significance and how they might
be impacted by construction. The survey was done in response to project review under
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. The Antiquities Code of
Texas applies since the Trinity River Authority is a political entity of the State of Texas
and Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4782 was issued for the survey.
This report was written in accordance with the guidelines for short reports adopted by the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (ND). The following report contains a brief description of the
natural environment and then a summary of previous archaeological investigations in the
area as known from published sources. This is followed by the research design and
methodology. The description of the results of the field investigation constitutes the
majority of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations that arise from the
study. A list of references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL SETTING
Denton County is located in North Central Texas. It is bisected by the sandy soil of the
Eastern Cross Timbers. The western portion of the county consists, on the surface, of the
black soil of the Fort Worth Prairie while the eastern part consists of the rich, black soil
of the Blackland Prairie. The county is drained by the Elm Fork of the Trinity River and
several major creeks. (Odom 2003).
Quaternary alluvial terrace deposits overlie the Lower Cretaceous-aged Grayson Marl
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1967). There are no reported springs in the area (Brune
1981:159-161).
Soils within the study area overlie the Lower Cretaceous-aged Grayson Marl (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1967) and belong to the Slidell-Sanger Soil Association which
contains gently sloping to moderately steep upland savannah clays (Ford and Pauls
1980:General Soil Map). Specific soils within the study area consist of Justin fine sandy
loam with 1 to 3 percent slopes (Ford and Paul 1980:Sheet 45).
Prehistoric and historic inhabitants along Denton Creek would have used mast from oak
trees for food along with the edible seeds of various grasses. The inhabitants also would
have been able to acquire deer, squirrel and turkey which feed on the mast. Other nuts
such as pecans and walnuts also would be available. Finally, Denton Creek was a likely
perennial source for mussels, fish and turtles and aquatic birds. Bison would have been
present on the prairies.
A consensus about the paleoenvironmental conditions of North Central Texas over the
past 12,000 years has not been reached. Discussions by Prikryl (1993), Ferring and Yates
(1997), Humphrey and Ferring (1994), and Brown (1998) offer disparate interpretations
based on different analytical approaches. The following discussion relies heavily on
Ferring’s investigations and focuses upon the past two thousand years. Correlating
periods of rapid alluviation with higher precipitation and slow alluviation with drier
conditions, Ferring has concluded that the Late Holocene [5000 yr B.P. to the present]
was a wet period with moderate alluviation, except for a dry period between 2000 and
1000 yr B.P. [A.D. 1 to 1000]. It was during this dry period that the West Fork Paleosol
was established on the stable surfaces of the river meanders along the Upper Trinity and
its tributaries. This interpretation is supported by changing patterns seen in stable isotope
analysis. Brown (1998) offers a differing interpretation based on isotopic analyses of
mussel shells from a prehistoric site (41DL270) on Denton Creek. He concludes that the
period from 1500 to 2500 yr B.P. was cooler and/or wetter and that before and after, the
environment was warmer and drier, but he points out that this interpretation may only be
applicable for the Elm Fork tributary and not the region.

CULTURE HISTORY
The history and prehistory of Denton County are summarized in several reports prepared
by the University of North Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990; Brown and Lebo 1991; Ferring
and Yates 1998). Prehistoric Native American settlement in Denton County began at least
10,000 years ago as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points (Crook
and Harris 1957) at the Lewisville site and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 2001).
Moreover, artifact collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff and other
Paleo-Indian points from the surface of sites in the region. The presence of exotic, i.e.,
non-local, lithic resources indicates that these early people traveled a territory where
higher quality lithics were available or were involved in a system of raw material trading.
These early people hunted now-extinct large game, but probably also foraged off the
land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from 7,000-6,000 B.C. to possibly as late as
A.D. 700-800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the county but particularly along the
major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather native foods.
Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are common artifacts found
on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued using exotic cherts for dart
points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local lithics for chipped
stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde Gravels (Menzer and Slaughter
1971). Large Archaic sites are generally located on terraces or ridges that overlook the
Elm Fork of the Trinity. Smaller lithic scatters have been recorded in upland areas
throughout the county. These sites appear to be Archaic in age, but none have been
thoroughly studied.
Various authors, including Peter and McGregor (1988), have attempted to create a
chronology for North Central Texas. The most commonly used chronology was
established by Prikryl (1990) which divides the Late Prehistoric, the time from the use of
the bow and pottery to the Historic Indian, into two periods: Late Prehistoric I (A.D. 700
to 1200) and Late Prehistoric II (A.D. 1200 to 1700).
During Late Prehistoric I times, a small amount of pottery appears at the Baggett Branch
site, 41DL149 (Prikryl and Perttula 1995:189). Arrowheads appear about this same time
and apparently the bow and arrow had been added to the hunting tools. From A.D. 1000
to 1300, pottery appears in North Central Texas that has similarities to Caddoan pottery
as well as Caddoan and Jornada Mogollon ceramics occur on sites in North Central Texas
(Prikryl and Perttula 1995). In addition houses were found at the Cobb-Pool site,
41DL148, (Peter and McGregor 1988:140). Fritz (1993) mentions the use of corn for
food in North Central Texas during this time and Todd (1999) suggests that the presence
of mussel shell hoes in North Central Texas indicates some form of farming.

During Late Prehistoric II times, it is believed that the climate was drier. Bison may have
been utilized more than in Late Prehistoric I times. The presence of bison-scapula hoes,
especially in northern North Central Texas, suggests an increase in horticulture or, at
least, its first appearance. This concept is supported by the presence of sites along sandy
terraces instead of the floodplain area where Late Prehistoric I sites are found. Also, there
is a marked Plains influence in North Central Texas during this time (Prikryl 1990:80).
At the end of the Late Prehistoric periods, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of the North Central Texas area. Along Red River in Montague and Cooke
Counties and across Red River in Oklahoma, there is both archaeological and
ethnographic evidence of historic Taovayas, Wichitas and Yscanis Indians (Bell, Jelks
and Newcomb 1967; John 1992:204). Since the Spanish could not subdue the Indians,
they made them their allies with promises of help against the Osages.
There is tantalizing evidence found on the Trinity River in Dallas County of a possible
visit by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto (Bruseth 1992). Artifacts found consist of a
chain-mail gauntlet, a halberd and a spur. Current research, however, seems to indicate
that Anglo settlers were the first non-Indians to settle in North Central Texas.
The first established European settlement in Denton County began before the mid-1800
with the establishment of the Peter’s Colony after Texas independence. These early
settlers were farmers who selected bottomland along the Elm Fork of the Trinity (Bridges
1978). Commercial farming was not important until after the Civil War, and the early
settlers were essentially self-sufficient. Besides the plants and animals they grew, wild
animals and plants were commonly consumed. Denton became the county seat in 1856.
By 1875, cotton, corn, and wheat were the main cash crops. Up to half of these crops
were grown by tenant farmers who either paid rent to the land owner for their house,
tools, and seed or by tenants who gave the landowner a third of the grain and a quarter of
the cotton or other cash crops. By the turn of the century, all of the major communities
had been established and some had passed away.
Previous Investigations
Several prehistoric buried sites have been found on the banks of Denton Creek, east of
Lake Grapevine’s dam. The intriguing question is the absence and presence of the sites
along the creek. A cluster of sites may be found and then a large area will not contain
sites. AR Consultants, Inc. placed 13 backhoe trenches along Denton Creek east of SH
2499 but encountered cultural materials in four (Todd and Skinner 2003a).
Several general statements may be made concerning the archaeological sites found along
Denton Creek. Sites occur within the floodplain proper, on terraces and overbank levees,
especially adjacent to feeder creeks. They are buried, usually 2 meters below the ground
surface. Sites containing mussels were probably temporary occupations because the
mussel middens do not contain a great amount of mussel shells or animal bones. The
presence of manos in so many sites indicates that plant processing was important in the
area. Unfortunately, the only site to recover plant data was 41L270. Sites were probably

occupied during the fall which would be a good time to gather acorns as suggested by
Skinner, Caran and Trask (1999) and mussels as suggested by Claassen (1998). Most of
the sites are Archaic in age, even though there are Late Prehistoric occupations in the
area, but these are found mainly on the surface. The discrepancy between the presence of
Late Prehistoric and Archaic sites may be that the Late Prehistoric sites have been
destroyed due to plowing. Prikryl (1990:83) notes that Late Archaic sites are more
numerous than any other period in his study of the prehistory of the Lower Elm Fork. The
same may be true for Denton Creek.
The following is a brief description of some of the discoveries. Skinner, Whorton and
Young (1991) excavated the Golf Ball site, 41TR55, immediately east of the dam.
Artifacts were recovered from trenches at depths of 205 cm. After investigating the site,
the authors concluded that the site was a large, multicomponent site with at least two
major periods of occupation.
East of the Golf Ball site, Skinner and Todd (2003a) uncovered a disarticulated hearth at
133 cm below the surface and several shell middens as well in Denton Creek’s
floodplain. Site 41TR201, consisting of charcoal, fire-cracked rock and mussel shells was
found from 184 to 200 cm below the surface.
Jan and Paul Lorrain, along with Bill Young, have discovered several sites along Denton
Creek (Lorrain and Lorrain 2001). Site 41TR116 is located on a terrace south of Denton
Creek near a spring. It contained chips, flakes and cobbles eroding into a pasture. They
believed the site to be Archaic in age. Site 41TR117, located on the Tarrant/Denton
counties boundary, and north of the study area, was investigated by the Lorrains and Bill
Young in 1986. The site, located on a terrace overlooking Denton Creek, consisted of
flakes, flint chips, cobble fragments and the tip of a point. Jan and Paul Lorrain
investigated a site in 1988 (41DL270) found by Bill Young. The site is in a terrace
overlooking Denton Creek, and the soil the site was in consisted of Trinity Clay and Frio
Sand. Bone, shell, snails, flint chips, manos, points and deer teeth could be seen exposed
in the eroding surface. Jan and Paul Lorrain excavated some of the possible hearths and
found fire-cracked rock, charcoal and some evidence of burned clay. Based upon the
projectile points, the site was dated to the Archaic, and was probably a multiple
occupation area. Cultural materials extended to at least 1.83 meters below the surface.
In 1994, 41DL270 was investigated further by Brown and Anthony (1991). They
uncovered cultural deposits greater than 2.5 meters deep. Nine distinct cultural zones,
dating from Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric times, were uncovered. Excavation of this
site provided insights into prehistoric use of invertebrate and vertebrate animals and
plants, a paleoenvironmental synthesis and archeomagnetic studies. Plant data was
especially important since many of the small sites recorded by Jan and Paul Lorrain
contain manos.

Sites 41DL 252, 295, 296, 297, 299 and 300 are discussed together and are all recorded
by Jan and Paul Lorrain (Lorrain and Lorrain 2001). The artifacts eroding out of banks of

Denton Creek consisted of mussel shells, manos, hearths, fire-cracked rock, dart points,
lithic artifacts and debris and bone. These sites are probably Late Archaic (2000 B.C. to
A.D. 700) in age. These sites are located approximately 2 meters below the surface.
No sites have been recorded in the survey area (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas 2007);
however, AR Consultants (Skinner 1990) conducted an archaeological survey for Lone
Star Gas of a pipeline route across Denton Creek west of the study area as did AR
Consultants, Inc. (Todd and Skinner 2003b). No cultural materials were seen on the
ground surface or uncovered in 28 shovel tests along the approximately 10,360 feet long
pipeline across Denton Creek and the uplands adjacent to it.
Prior to the field survey, records were checked with Texas Historical Commission’s
Archeological Sites Atlas (2007). Historic maps, including the 1918 Soil Map of Denton
County (Carter and Beck 1918) and the R. King Harris’ Denton County highway map
(1948) were also reviewed. No historic farmsteads were shown on the maps within the
APE nor had any archaeological sites been recorded.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The purpose of the research design outlined below was to insure that fieldwork made a
contribution to the better understanding of prehistoric and historic settlement in this part
of Denton County. We proposed the three research problems presented below.
Based upon previous investigations in the area, it was felt that the study
area had a low potential for containing prehistoric archaeological sites.
Prehistoric sites usually are found in Denton Creek’s floodplain and on its
terraces.
and
The potential for a historic site being present is good. Since the historic
settlers did not necessarily follow existing routes and used cisterns and
wells for a water supply, historic sites might be present in a variety of
settings.
A third, and even more basic, research problem guided the survey work. Simply stated
the question asked,
How did past people use the land, and what record of this use did they
leave behind?
Most frequently, small-scale surveys of this type gather information in response to this
more open-minded research question, which guides almost all archaeological surveys.
Methodology
In order to address these research questions, a comprehensive pedestrian survey of the
proposed pipeline route was conducted. The proposed pipeline route is approximately
1,300 feet long and has an easement of 80 feet. The surveyors, with the proper USGS and
soil maps, systematically inspected the tract by walking parallel generally north and south
oriented transects spaced 15 meters apart along the proposed pipeline route. Notes on the
vegetation, soil and physiography of the study area were made. Photographs also were
taken. Since the proposed pipeline route is to be placed in an upland setting, shovel tests
were excavated on a judgmental basis as recommended by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (2002). The loamy matrices were screened through a ¼-inch hardwire
screen and the pit walls were examined for artifacts as well.

RESULTS
In this portion of the report, the intensive pedestrian archaeological survey is described which is
followed by the conclusions derived from the survey. Shovel tests are described specifically in
the text and are shown on Figure 3.
The Survey
Survey began north of Dunham Road in an improved pasture (Figure 2) and went northeast and
north following the staked proposed pipeline route. The terrain gently slopes down to the east.
Ground visibility ranged from less than 10 to 40 percent and eye-height visibility was excellent.
Shovel test 1 (Figure 2) was excavated prior to the tree line shown in Figure 2 on a small knoll
and encountered 37 cm of dark yellowish-brown (10YR3/4) sandy clayey loam that contained
abundant gravel. The forested area north of Shovel test 1 is approximately 30 m wide and
contains eastern red cedars, winged elm, American elm and hackberry trees along with
understory vegetation that consists of saw greenbriar, grape vines, grama grasses and other
prairie grasses. North of the forested area, the proposed route continues through unimproved
pasture that contains broomweed, prickly pear, grama grass and other prairie grasses. Ground
visibility was less than 10 percent but eye-height visibility was excellent.

Shovel test locations plotted on a portion of the Argyle, Texas 7.5’ USGS
map.

Shovel test 2 was placed on a generally level ridge north of the forested area and
uncovered 36 cm of the dark yellowish-brown (10YR3/4) sandy clayey loam found in
Shovel test 1, but no gravel was present. Just north of Shovel test 2, the proposed route is
to be constructed in the center of a grass-covered two track road. The proposed pipeline
route crosses the toes of two ridges (Figure 4) and no shovel tests were excavated along
this portion of the route due to the slope.
Shovel test 3 was placed on a bench overlooking a tributary to Whites Branch where the
proposed pipeline route terminates. The shovel test encountered 38 cm of brown
(10YR5/3) sandy clay.
Conclusions
No cultural materials were seen on the ground surface or encountered in the three shovel tests as
expected. Prehistoric sites probably were not present due to the absence of perennial water and
lack of knappable lithic resources. Historic sites probably are not present because the EuropeanAmerican settlers preferred to use the land for ranching since it is on the edge of a series of
ridges.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources were
present within the short portion of the proposed Whites Branch pipeline route and outfall
structure. None were found. Based upon the absence of archaeological sites, AR
Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource investigations are
unwarranted. We further recommend that construction supervisors be advised that if
buried archaeological materials could be uncovered during construction, work should
immediately cease in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission be notified of the discovery.
