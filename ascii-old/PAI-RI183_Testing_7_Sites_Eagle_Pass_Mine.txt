ABSTRACT
From January to March 2017, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted
National Register of Historic Places testing at seven prehistoric sites in Maverick County, Texas.
This work was undertaken as part of the planned expansion of the Eagle Pass Mine operated
by the Dos Republicas Coal Partnership and Camino Real Fuels, L.L.C., of the North American
Coal Corporation. Testing revealed that all seven sites have both surface and subsurface deposits
dating mainly from the Middle Archaic through Late Prehistoric periods. All of the sites have
buried archeological deposits, mostly at shallow depths, in Holocene alluvium on the valley
floor (41MV185, 41MV189, 41MV190, 41MV202, and 41MV319), at the base of the valley wall
(41MV149), or in a small tributary valley (41MV394). However, the slow rate of deposition
and extensive and repeated episodes of erosion have conflated the deposits of varying ages,
precluding the opportunity to define discrete cultural components. Because of this, the generally
low artifact densities, the poor preservation of faunal and floral remains, and the near-absence
of datable materials, none of these sites holds the kinds of important information needed to
address substantive questions concerning the prehistory of south Texas. Hence, all seven are
considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION AND
BACKGROUND INFORMATION

This report details the results of National Register of Historic Places testing
of seven prehistoric sites conducted for the Dos Republicas Coal Partnership and
North American Coal CorporationâCamino Real Fuels, L.L.C., in Maverick County,
Texas. These investigations were performed by Prewitt and Associates, Inc., during
JanuaryâMarch 2017. Sites tested are 41MV149, 41MV185, 41MV189, 41MV190,
41MV202, 41MV319, and 41MV394, all of which will be impacted by expansion of
the Eagle Pass Mine located northwest of the City of Eagle Pass, Texas. The work
was done to assist the Dos Republicas Coal Partnership in complying with the
requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as
amended) and the Railroad Commission of Texas.
The archeological testing confirmed that the seven sites were likely open
camps with multiple occupations dating from the Middle Archaic through Late
Prehistoric periods, with the diagnostic tools suggesting most-intensive occupation
during the Late Archaic period. Dating of the site deposits is based almost solely
on the diagnostic lithic tools recovered, most of which were found on the surface
or from erosional cuts. All of the sites have buried archeological deposits, mostly
at shallow depths, in Holocene alluvium on the valley floor (41MV185, 41MV189,
41MV190, 41MV202, and 41MV319), at the base of the valley wall (41MV149), or
in a small tributary valley (41MV394). However, the slow rate of deposition and
extensive and repeated episodes of erosion have conflated the deposits of varying
ages, precluding the opportunity to define discrete cultural components. Because of
this, the generally low artifact densities, the poor preservation of faunal and floral
remains, and the near-absence of datable materials, none of these sites holds the
kinds of important information needed to address substantive questions concerning
the prehistory of south Texas. Hence, all seven are considered ineligible for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places.
LOCATION
The area that contains the tested sites lies within the middle Rio Grande
region of Maverick County, Texas. The tested sites are on the floodplain, terraces,
and tributaries of Elm Creek, which flows into the Rio Grande. Four of the sites
(41MV185, 41MV189, 41MV190, and 41MV202) are situated between the west bank
of Elm Creek and the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks east of the active mine. Site
41MV319 is on the east bank of Elm Creek at the north end of the mine permit
area. Site 41MV394 is on an unnamed tributary of Elm Creek at the south edge of
the mine. And 41MV149 is on a southward-projecting upland toe slope overlooking
the Elm Creek floodplain at the western edge the mine (Figure 1).

Chapter 1: Introduction and Background Information
GEOLOGY AND SOILS
Maverick County is underlain by the Upper Cretaceous Olmos Formation,
consisting of clay, sandstone, and coal, with dispersed pockets of Tertiary and
Quaternary gravel distributed across upland ridge tops and old high terraces.
Predominant mapped soils in the uplands are the Pryor and Copita associations,
which are deep, calcareous, clayey and loamy residual soils weathered from shale
and sandstone (Web Soil Survey 2017). Gravels occur within soils of the Jimenez
association, which are shallow calcareous soils at a high risk for erosion. Mapped
Holocene alluvium is restricted to the Elm Creek channel and surrounding floodplain,
as well as confluences with major tributaries (Bureau of Economic Geology 1976).
The main mapped alluvial soils are Elindo silty clay loam and Montell clay (Web
Soil Survey 2017).
FLORA AND FAUNA
Maverick County is in the South Texas Plains ecoregion of Texas and the
Tamaulipan biotic province (Blair 1950). Upland vegetation consists of mesquite,
prickly pear, tasajillo, cenizo, huisache, and a variety of grasses (Blair 1950:103).
Vegetation along streams is similar to that of the uplands but with the addition of
deciduous trees such as elm and hackberry.
The Tamaulipan province supports a diverse array of wildlife, including
fauna that were exploited by prehistoric Native Americans such as white-tailed
deer, jackrabbits, cottontail rabbits, squirrels and other rodents, raccoons, land
tortoise, quail, turkey, and a variety of other birds and water fowl. One animal seen
in abundance today not available to prehistoric people are feral hogs.
CLIMATE
Maverick County has a semiarid climate, often receiving little precipitation.
Summers are generally very hot and winters are mild, with low humidity most of
the year (Stevens and Arriaga 1977:59). The average winter maximum temperature
is 64Â°F, and summers are very hot with 115Â°F being the highest temperature on
record. Precipitation almost always falls as rain, averaging just over 21 inches
annually. Rain in Maverick County can fall in torrents causing extensive erosion on
steep slopes and flooding with overbank deposition of alluvium. The county can also
suffer from summer droughts where low precipitation is a factor in soil deflation
by wind. Prevailing winds blow out of the southeast for much of the year (Stevens
and Arriaga 1977:55â59).
NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The Native American cultural sequence in the middle Rio Grande region of
south Texas primarily adheres to the three-part sequence that applies over most of
the state: Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric. The Archaic period is further
subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late Archaic. Classifications are based largely
on transformations in projectile point styles and other technological changes,
supplemented with data from neighboring regions. While only a basic synopsis is

4

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
provided here, Hester (2004) provides a detailed discussion of the lithic technology
and culture history regarding this region, with studies done by Johnson and Goode
(1994) and Collins (1995) for central Texas adding chronological refinement to
Hesterâs (2004) reconstruction.
Marked by fluted projectile points such as Clovis and Folsom, the Paleoindian
period (pre-10,000â6500 b.c.) represents the earliest occupations. Little is known
about Paleoindian people other than they were hunters and gatherers living in small
bands that were often on the move to take advantage of a wide range of game and
plant resources. It has long been presumed that the earliest Paleoindians hunted
big game, but no mammoth kill or butchering sites have been recorded in south
Texas (Hester 2004:133). Common nonfluted points from later Paleoindian contexts
in this region include Plainview and Golondrina, followed even later by Angostura
and Early Stemmed Lanceolate points, which are thought to be localized to the
central coastal plain (Turner et al. 2011:59, 86).
Evidence suggests that changes in lifeways occurred only gradually from
the Late Paleoinidan into the Holocene epoch, but a number of new types of
projectile points did emerge. These new types serve as the basis for defining the
Archaic period and its subperiods. Beginning some 8,500 years ago, the Early
Archaic (6500â3500 b.c.), as described by Hester (2004:136â137), consists of two
distinct lithic horizons represented by early corner-notched and early basal-notched
projectile points, as well as the occurrence of specialized tools such as Guadalupe
tools and triangular bifaces. Projectile points associated with this period include
Baker-Uvalde and Merrell.
The Middle Archaic (3500â1000 b.c.) is marked by the increased use of formal
earth ovens, hearths, and burned rock middens, suggesting increased exploitation
of plant food resources. Additional evidence of camp life during this period may be
reflected in the development of distally beveled tools, such as Clear Fork and Dimmitt
tools, that were likely used as adzes for woodworking (Hester 2004:138â139).
Projectile point types associated with this period include Andice, Pandale, Pedernales,
Marshall, Travis, and perhaps Abasolo, Langtry, Pandora, and Tortugas. The use of
earth ovens and associated burned rock accumulations along with distally beveled
tools continued well into the Late Archaic period (1000 b.c.âa.d. 800). Bulverde,
Ensor, Frio, Kinney, Lange, Marcos, and Shumla projectile points are common types
seen for this period in this region of Texas.
The advent of the bow and arrow around a.d. 800 marks the beginning of
the Late Prehistoric period. Dart point styles like Ensor apparently continued to
be used, suggesting persistence or recycling of some tool forms (Hester 2004:143).
Arrow point styles include Scallorn, Edwards, Caracara, and Perdiz. Ceramics
were used for the first time during the Late Prehistoric period suggesting moresedentary lifestyles at certain times and places, although this was not common. The
best-documented Late Prehistoric sites are those of the Toyah horizon, which was
widespread across south and central Texas during this time. Toyah is thought to
represent a buffalo-hunting way of life, but how readily this life style was accepted
by groups along the middle Rio Grande or whether the horizon represents an influx

Chapter 1: Introduction and Background Information
of groups from central Texas is still debated. Material culture often associated with
Toyah sites includes Perdiz arrow points, small end scrapers, flake knives, flake
drills, beveled knives, bone-tempered pottery, and perhaps pipes, beads, and other
ornaments (Hester 2004:146â147).
The protohistoric period is that short period of time at first European contact,
prior to when Native economies and lifeways were altered severely. For this area
of Texas, it includes sites through the late seventeenth century. The shipwreck of
Cabeza de Vaca and arrival of Spaniards in the a.d. 1600s mark the first European
contact in the region. These early incursions by the Spanish had limited effects,
unlike missionization efforts of the eighteenth century. When the Spanish settled
the region and began constructing churches and presidios, a European foothold was
set. This is the beginning of the historic period, and with that came a cessation of
Native ways of life, as well as deadly epidemics that wiped out local populations
along the middle Rio Grande and in much of Texas.

CHAPTER 2: PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The Eagle Pass Mine has been the scene of a series of archeological
investigations, starting in 1981. The first project was conducted by Espey, Huston
and Associates, Inc., for the Dahlstrom Corporation and was an archeological survey
that covered 3,044 acres and recorded 42 sites (Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc.
1981). The survey covered almost all of the western part of the 6,346-acre mine
area (i.e., west of the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks), extending beyond the
current mine boundaries in some areas. Forty-one of the sites contained only Native
American remains, and 1 had both Native American and historic components.
Twenty-nine sites were in lowland settings along alluvial terraces of Elm Creek
and its tributaries, while the remaining 13 were in upland settings. Thirteen sites
were recommended as having the potential to contain important information and
thus be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places; the other 29
were considered ineligible.
In 1992, the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) of the University
of Texas at San Antonio conducted an intensive survey under a contract with
Marston and Marston, Inc., of 971 acres in the eastern part of the mine (i.e., east
of the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks), encompassing a long segment of Elm
Creek (Uecker 1994). The survey recorded 27 new archeological sites (26 Native
American and 1 historic). In addition, 6 sites recorded during the 1981 survey
in the western part of the mine were revisited and reassessed. Fourteen of the
newly recorded sites and 4 previously recorded sites were considered ineligible for
National Register listing, and the other 21 sites were judged to need further work for
complete assessments. One significant contribution of this project was the inclusion
of geomorphological investigations, which made an initial attempt at understanding
the depositional and erosional history of the Elm Creek valley (Shanabrook 1994).
In 1993, Archaeology Consultants, Inc., surveyed ca. 100 acres within CARâs
1992 project area that had not been covered previously and recorded 2 sites; 37
other sites were re-examined. Of the 39 sites assessed, 21 were recommended for
further work to determine their eligibility for National Register listing (Uecker
and Warren 1995).
There was a 12-year hiatus in archeological work before GTI Environmental,
Inc., conducted two testing projects for North American Coal Corporation at Native
American sites in the western part of the mine in 2005. One project consisted of
excavations at 41MV135, 41MV136, 41MV137, 41MV138, 41MV144, 41MV145, and
41MV160 (Iruegas, Galindo, and Iruegas 2009), and the other focused on testing at
7

8

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
41MV164 (Iruegas, Iruegas, and Galindo 2009). Table 1 summarizes these sites. GTI
recommended that six of the eight sites (all but 41MV144 and 41MV145) contain
important information and are eligible for National Register listing.
In 2007, PBS&J (now Atkins) conducted data recovery investigations
at 41MV135, 41MV136, 41MV137, 41MV138, 41MV160, and 41MV164 for Dos
Republicas Coal Partnership/North American Coal Corporation (Stahman et
al. 2011). All six are prehistoric campsites located along an unnamed tributary
of Elm Creek; they are summarized in Table 1. The work consisted of extensive
remote sensing at each site with limited success, excavation of 291 mechanical
trenches, and documentation of 102 cultural features, of which 56 were manually
excavated. The excavation strategy was based on finding features, documenting
their morphology, and collecting feature fill for further analysis. The vast majority of
the investigated features were burned rock cooking facilities, with a few occupation
surfaces and middens sampled as well. Much of the data gathered reinforced previous
interpretations that the Native Americans who occupied the area prehistorically
were mobile hunter-gatherers who relied on local plants and animals for subsistence
and used local raw materials to produce stone tools.
The following year, PBS&J conducted an intensive archeological survey of
625 acres for Dos Republicas Coal Partnership/North American Coal Corporation
in several areas along the western and northern edges of the mine, all west of the
Southern Pacific Railroad tracks. That survey recorded 8 new archeological sites
and reevaluated 9 previously recorded sites, all of which have only Native American
components (Watkins and Nash 2009). Sixteen sites were judged ineligible for
National Register listing, and 1 site was recommended for further work for complete
assessment.
Also in 2008, PBS&J conducted National Register of Historic Places eligibility
testing at three archeological sites in the western part of the mine: 41MV141 had both
Native American and historic components, and 41MV157 and 41MV161 had solely
Native American materials (Watkins and Nash 2010). These sites are summarized
in Table 1. All three sites were considered ineligible for National Register listing
due to the high level of disturbance.
In 2009, Turpin and Sons (TAS), Inc., conducted a survey of ca. 1,625 acres
in the northeast part of the mine for the Dos Republicas Coal Partnership (Turpin
et al. 2010). This survey included some lands along Elm Creek and a large tributary,
as well as uplands east of the Elm Creek valley. It recorded 26 new Native American
sites, 24 of which were judged ineligible for National Register listing. Two sites near
Elm Creek, 41MV318 and 41MV319, were found to have buried deposits with the
potential for important information and were recommended for further work for
complete assessments. TAS, Inc., tested these two sites the following year. Table 1
summarizes the work done and the results. Turpin et al. (2011) concluded that parts
of both sites have buried components with sufficient integrity to yield important
information and thus that both are eligible for the National Register.
In 2012, TAS, Inc., conducted limited excavations (trenching but no manual
test units at all but 41MV139) at 10 Native American sitesâ41MV139, 41MV149,

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
41MV184, 41MV185, 41MV186, 41MV189, 41MV190, 41MV199, 41MV201, and
41MV202âfor the Dos Republicas Coal Partnership (Turner et al. 2013, 2015). The
work at 41MV139, in the western potion of the mine, was detailed in a separate report
because of mine permitting considerations (Turner et al. 2013); it was assessed as
ineligible for National Register listing because its Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
components were mixed and not stratigraphically separable (Turner et al. 2013).
Site 41MV149, also in the western part of the mine, also was assessed as ineligible
(Turner et al. 2015:ii), but the report documenting the details of the work there
is not posted in the Texas Historical Commissionâs Archeological Sites Atlas and
has not yet been found in the files at the mine. The other eight trenched sites are
within the Elm Creek valley in the eastern part of the mine. Turner et al. (2015)
concluded that five do not contain âsubstantial intact cultural depositsâ and thus
are not eligible for National Register listing, while parts of three sites (41MV185,
41MV189, and 41MV202) contain intact buried deposits with a better potential for
important information. A subsequent review of this report by Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., preparatory to submittal of the draft to the Texas Historical Commission
concluded that four of the sites (41MV185, 41MV189, 41MV190, and 41MV202)
needed additional work for full National Register assessments (Fields 2015).
In 2014, Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted an archeological and
historical resources survey for Camino Real Fuels, L.L.C., within 1,460 acres of land
in the east part of the mine. The survey resulted in the discovery of 15 prehistoric
Native American sites and 1 historic artifact scatter associated with a complex of
ruinous buildings (Norment et al. 2015). Three of the Native American sites are in
floodplain settings and contain subsurface deposits, while all other recorded sites
are confined to upland surfaces. The 3 floodplain sites, 41MV394â41MV396, were
judged potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places under
Criterion D, and further work was recommended for complete eligibility assessments.
The other 13 sites were judged ineligible for National Register listing. The historical
resources survey identified 6 resources. Three ruinous buildings and a structure
associated with the 1912â1944 Rohleder Brothers ranch were designated 41MV389.
The other resources consisted of a mid-twentieth-century private irrigation system
and a ca. 1960 lake. All of these historical resources are recommended as ineligible
for listing in the National Register.

CHAPTER 3: METHODS OF INVESTIGATION

GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
From January to March 2017, a five-person crew from Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., conducted National Register of Historic Places testing at seven prehistoric
sites in Maverick County, Texas. The sitesâ41MV149, 41MV185, 41MV189,
41MV190, 41MV202, 41MV319, and 41MV394âwill be impacted completely or
in part by mining-related activities. All seven sites were originally recorded as
surface scatters of lithic artifacts and burned rocks that likely represent repeated
occupations by Native Americans (Norment et al. 2015; Turner et al. 2013; Turpin et
al. 2010; Watkins and Nash 2009). The initial survey work, along with some limited
testing, indicated that these sites have the potential to contain intact buried lenses
of artifacts or features that could provide important information on the age and
nature of the Native American occupations. Formal testing of these sites was done
to evaluate this potential and thereby fully assess their National Register eligibility.
The sites are on or adjacent to a dynamic floodplain setting where cultural
deposits can be both preserved and destroyed by flood episodes. The Elm Creek
floodplain has a corrugated appearance with sinuous linear depressions formed
by the modern channel and numerous relict channels and flood chutes. These
channels alternate with interchannel ridges that are cored by bedrock or alluvial
deposits of Pleistocene age and are draped with a thin veneer of Holocene alluvium.
Five of the sites (41MV185, 41MV189, 41MV190, 41MV202, and 41MV319) are on
these interchannel ridges. The relict channels and flood chutes still carry water or
form ponds during wet periods, making these attractive locations for prehistoric
occupation. Another tested site, 41MV149, is in alluvium deposited at the base of a toe
slope adjacent to the edge of the Elm Creek floodplain. The seventh site, 41MV394,
is in Holocene alluvium along a tributary to Elm Creek. The focus of testing sites in
such a dynamic depositional environment was to find buried archeological deposits
that are intact and that contain sufficient materials and features (e.g. hearths,
lithic tools, floral, and faunal remains) to enable confident interpretation. Sites
having these qualities are likely to contain information important to understanding
prehistory and thus be eligible for listing in the National Register under Criterion D.
FIELD METHODS
Testing was accomplished using a series of backhoe trenches placed across
each site and 1x1-m excavation units placed off of selected trenches. Trenching,
using a backhoe with a straight-edged bucket, was carried out to identify alluvial
13

14

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
deposits and search for buried archeological materials within those deposits. To
this end, trench walls were cleaned and documented by the field crew, and the
soils within representative trenches were described by the project geoarcheologist.
Concentrations of materials (usually fire-cracked rocks) noted in the trench walls
were further explored by the excavation units. All trenches and test units were
backfilled upon completion of the investigations.
The number of trenches and their placement at each site were based on
several factors. Foremost were site size and the results of previous investigations that
recorded buried deposits or the potential for buried deposits. Also important were
the locations of artifact scatters eroding from the sitesâ surfaces and the proximity
of relictt or active channels. Finally, the locations of planned impacts from mining
played a role, since parts of some sites will not be impacted, as did site location
relative to the Elm Creek Protection Plan buffer (a ca. 400-ft-wide strip along the
creek where there will be no disturbance from mining). For instance, at 41MV319
trenching was done only on the eastern half of the site, which will be affected by a
mine haul road and stock pile location. Although Turpin et al. (2011) found extensive
cultural materials on the west edge of the site, this area was not trenched because it
is in the Elm Creek Protection Plan buffer and will not be impacted by mining. Test
units were excavated adjacent to trenches where appreciable quantities of cultural
materials were present. In total, 112 trenches were excavated at the seven sites,
ranging from 5 at 41MV394 to 34 at 41MV202 (Table 2). Twenty-eight test units
were excavated, ranging from 2 to 7 per site. At one site (41MV189), the excavations
included using a Gradall to strip the surface sediments around a human burial to
ensure that no other such features were present.

Trenches and test units were numbered sequentially by site. Trenches
ranged from 5 to 17 m in length with an average of 8 m. Trench depth ranged from
0.6 to 1.7 m with an average of 0.9 m. Trench width was approximately 1.2 m. An
excavation form was filled out for each trench giving a description of setting, size,
depth, sediments, and the location of any cultural materials noted in the walls.
In addition, a selected wall in each trench was photographed. The test units were
1x1 m in dimension and dug in 10-cm levels from the ground surface. Test unit depth
ranged from 30 to 100 cm with an average of 40 cm. Excavation was halted in a
unit when bedrock was encountered or a substantial drop in artifact recovery was
observed. A testing excavation record form was filled out for each unit. Information
on this form included the trench number
on which the unit was located, artifact

stone tools, debitage, mussel shell fragments, and snail shells) were transported
back to the laboratory in Austin for analysis.
Features identified in the excavation units were few with one each at
41MV189 and 41MV190 and two at 41MV202. Those at 41MV190 and 41MV202 were
concentrations of fire-cracked rocks and debitage that were either eroded remnants
of hearths or debris dumps. The feature at 41MV189 (found during previous testing)
was a human burial. Features were isolated within the unit levels in which they
occurred; they were photographed and mapped.
As noted, one of the keys to the placement of trenches in areas that might
contain buried deposits was identification of eroding surface concentrations of
artifacts. Collections of mainly diagnostic artifacts, such as dart and arrow points,
were made from these concentrations at each site. These concentrations provided
evidence of the horizontal extent of each site and the best evidence of the timing
of site occupations, as datable material such as charcoal was virtually nonexistent.
Grab samples of other chipped stone tools, ground stone tools, and cores were made
at several sites to provide information on the kinds of activities that occurred there.
In a few instances, such as at 41MV190 and 41MV202, surface concentrations of firecracked rocks appeared to be the eroded remnants of hearths, but little was in place
around them that could be unequivocally associated with activity areas. Similarly,
at 41MV319 mussel shell concentrations were noted on the surface, but the shells
were mostly highly fragmentary. Several relatively complete shells were collected
from one concentration. These remnant hearths and mussel shell concentrations
were photographed, and their locations were noted.
LABORATORY AND ARTIFACT ANALYSIS METHODS
The materials recovered were cataloged and analyzed in the lab at Prewitt
and Associates. Artifacts were washed and then labeled with a site number and lot
number indicating provenience. All lithic specimens identified as tools were also
given a lot-specific specimen number to aid their analysis. Other materials, such as
the mussel shells and snail shells, were cleaned and counted. Each artifact or item
class was recorded in a specimen inventory catalog.
Lithic Analysis Methods
Lithic tools recovered consist of 37 dart points, 3 arrow points, 7 bifaces,
6 adzes, 1 uniface, and 5 ground or battered stone tools. The majority came from
surface contexts, with dart and arrow points the main focus of that collection
strategy. The analysis of these tools includes observations on typology, chronological
placement, function, technological attributes (stylistic and manufacturing related),
patterns of tool use, raw material type, heat treatment, and to a lesser extent
breakage, repair, and discard. Raw material type identification was aided by the
use of a black light that causes Edwards chert to fluoresce. Lithic tool typological
and chronological assessments were made in reference to the works of Turner et
al. (2011) and Collins (2004). Other tool attributes provide some indications of
the technological organization of the groups that occupied the sites. Technological

15

16

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
organization entails the techniques and methods a group uses to design its tools to
perform efficiently in meeting basic daily needs. However, since discrete components
could not be isolated at any of the sites, the tools recovered have limited interpretive
value except to provide a generalized picture of tool usage during the Archaic and
Late Prehistoric periods.
The lithic cores (n = 12) and debitage (n = 1,028) also are of limited
interpretability. Still, the cores are described as to core type, raw material, and flaking
intensity. Debitage was sorted by material type, flake type, the presence or absence of
cortex, and evidence of heating. As with the stone tools, material type identification
was aided by a black light. Materials identified include Edwards chert, other chert
(chert that does not fluoresce under a black light), igneous rocks such as rhyolite
and andesite, quartzite, sandstone, and petrified wood. All of these materials are
found in the Uvalde Gravels, which crop out in Maverick County. Flake types are
flake, chip, and chunk, with flakes having evidence of a striking platform. Cortex
was noted as present for any amount on the dorsal surface of a flake, chip, or chunk.
Heating was noted as present based on either a lustrous surface or a color change
in the material. Some debitage has potlids and cracking, which can be indications
of exposure to high heat, but it is unclear whether heating occurred before or after
the debitage was discarded.
Other Materials
Other materials recovered consist of a single ceramic vessel sherd,
invertebrate faunal remains, fire-cracked rocks, and unmodified rock. These
materials were generally counted or weighed by provenience either in the field or
in the laboratory.
The single ceramic sherd is undecorated; it is described in terms of vessel
part, surface finish, surface and paste color, temper, size, and thickness. It is
difficult to place it within a particular ceramic type, but it is likely related to Leon
Plain ceramics associated with the Toyah phase of central Texas (Mehalchick et al.
1999) or historic Infierno phase ceramics from the Lower Pecos region (Turpin and
Robinson 1998).
Invertebrate remains consist of mussel shells and gastropod (snail) shells.
Both groups are highly fragmented and were found in surface, trench wall, and test
unit contexts. The gastropod shells are readily identifiable as Rabdotus sp. based
on a few complete shells and shell spires. These appear to be mainly from large
individuals, and counts by unit and level were made in the field and verified in the
lab. There is evidence, based on extensive concentrations of Rabdotus sp. shells from
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites, that this snail was used as a food source by
prehistoric Native Texans (Brown 2002:229â251; Gadus et al. 2006:73â78). However,
all of the Rabdotus sp. shell fragments found were widely scattered. Since this land
snail can be naturally deposited in site sediments, it was not used as an indicator
of the extent of cultural zones at the sites.
Counts of mussel shell fragments were also made from unit levels, but
generally there were not whole shells or even umbo fragments that could provide

Chapter 3: Methods of Investigation
identification. One cluster of mussel shells found on the surface at 41MV319 was
composed of mostly complete shells. A grab-sample (n = 11) of these shells was
collected to provide some information about mussel utilization. These shells were
identified using the identification guide by Howells et al. (1996) and the Prewitt
and Associates comparative collection. Valves were identified to the genus or species
level. The valves are not intact enough for size measurements, and so few umbos
or shell fragments were recovered per provenience that only simple counts rather
than weights were made.

CHAPTER 4: RESULTS OF TESTING

41MV149
Site Setting
Site 41MV149 is at the western edge of the Eagle Pass Mine permit area
on a south-facing toe slope of the Elm Creek valley wall. Hediondo Creek, a southflowing tributary of Elm Creek, is approximately 80 m east and 300 m southeast
of the site at its closest approaches. Site elevations range from 815 ft at the top
of the slope to 780 ft at the base. All of the site is within the life-of-mine permit
boundary, although mining activities are projected to impact only the northwestern
two-thirds, upslope from the 785-ft contour (Figure 2). A stand of large mesquite
and acacia trees with a dense understory of grasses, shrubs, and cacti is present
on the eastern and southern edges of the site. This dense vegetation follows an
irrigation canal that demarcates the base of the toe slope. Upslope from there the
site supports a combination of mesquite and acacia scrub, prickly pears and other
cacti, and grasses. Ground surface visibility in the dense vegetation is limited (30
percent), but visibility in upslope scrub is good (70 percent); abundant gravels and
some fire-cracked rocks are present at the surface on this highly eroded slope.
Previous Investigations
Site 41MV149 was first recorded in 1981 by personnel with Espey, Huston
and Associates, Inc., as a surface scatter of artifacts that included fire-cracked rocks,
lithic debitage, cores, a core tool, modified flakes, a scraper, and a biface (Espey,
Huston and Associates, Inc. 1981:3-14, 3-30, 3-33). An intact hearth was noted on
the surface at the south edge of the site at that time. The site was reassessed in
2008 during another cultural resources survey of the mine (Watkins and Nash
2009:18â21). Pedestrian transects spaced at 10-m intervals were walked across
the site, and numerous lithic artifacts were observed on the surface along with two
partially intact hearths in the east-central part. In addition, one backhoe trench
and eight shovel tests were excavated along the east edge, where deeper sediments
were deemed more likely to contain preserved archeological materials. The trench
exposed 35 cm of light brownish gray fine sandy loam over mixed sand and gravel
subsoil; no artifacts or features were noted. Four of the shovel tests produced four
flakes and two fire-cracked rocks at 0â10 cm, one flake at 10â20 cm, one fire-cracked
rock at 20â30 cm, one fire-cracked rock at 40â50 cm, and one flake at 50â60 cm.
The shovel test results led the investigators to conclude that, while most of the site
was eroded and exposed at the surface, there was a possibility for intact buried

deposits along the downslope, eastern edge. They recommended test excavations
to further explore this possibility and to determine the siteâs eligibility for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places.
Work Accomplished
Testing consisted of excavation of 10 backhoe trenches and 2 test units
(1x1 m), intensive surface scrutiny for diagnostic artifacts, and geomorphic
reassessment. All of this work was directed at the eastern edge of the site where
previous work had identified buried artifacts. The upslope part of the site was
not investigated, since it is severely eroded. The trenches were oriented generally
east-west to transect the slope of the landform. They ranged in length from 5.0 to
8.5 m and were 0.5 to 1.1 m deep. Cleaning and recording led to the identification of
artifacts in the walls only of Trenches 1, 6, and 10. Detailed sediment descriptions
were made for seven trenches (Trenches 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10).
Test units were placed off of Trenches 1 and 6 to further explore the materials
noted in those trenches. Test Unit 1, on north wall of Trench 6, was 40 cm deep.
Feature 1, a fire-cracked rock concentration, was defined within Level 3. Test Unit
2, on the south wall of Trench 1, was 40 cm deep; no features were defined. In all,
0.8 m3 of sediment were excavated and screened from these test units.
Site Sediments
Most of 41MV149 is mapped as Jimenez association soils, rolling (Web Soil
Survey 2017). Jimenez soils are very shallow to shallow, well-drained, Petrocalcic
Calciustolls formed in gravelly loamy alluvium (National Cooperative Soil Survey
2017a). They occupy gently sloping surfaces of ancient gravelly terraces, and, in the
case of 41MV149, the upper slopes of the Elm Creek valley wall. Soils of the Elindio
association, nearly level, are mapped along the eastern margin of the site. Elindio
soils are deep, well-drained, Aridic Calciustolls formed in calcareous loamy alluvium
(National Cooperative Soil Survey 2017b). At 41MV149, the Elindio soils probably
represent the fine-grained distal margin of alluvium deposited on the lower slopes
of the valley wall. The areal extent of the Elindio soils at 41MV149 is far greater
than what is portrayed on the National Cooperative Soil Survey maps, however. This
is reflected in the profiles of the backhoe trenches, which indicate that fine-grained
Elindio soils are present along the southern margin of the site as well.
All of the trenches express similar soil-stratigraphic profiles consisting of
loamy Holocene alluvium with varying amounts of gravel (typically 1 to 5 percent)
over an older alluvium comprised of muddy sandy gravel or muddy gravel (Appendix
A). In the two westernmost and southernmost trenches (Trenches 9 and 10), the
Holocene alluvium rests on weathered Cretaceous bedrock, which consists of pale
yellow (2.5Y 7/4) or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) loamy sediments typically imprinted
with a calcic B horizon (Figure 3a). Elsewhere, it rests atop late Pleistocene alluvium.
The Holocene alluvial mantle ranges in thickness from 35 to 89 cm and exhibits an
A-Bw soil profile (Figure 3b). The A horizon is typically dark grayish brown (10YR
4/2) silty clay loam, while the Bw horizon is generally brown (10YR 4/3) silty clay

loam. The presence of a cambic horizon (Bw) and overall degree of soil formation
suggest that the alluvium is no older than late Holocene in age.
Site Extent and Depth
Site 41MV149 was determined to be 375 m east-west and 175 m north-south
by the 2008 site survey (Watkins and Nash 2009:18). The testing reported here
does not change that horizontal extent. However, the 10 trenches and 2 test units
provide additional information on the vertical extent of the site. The excavations
demonstrated that cultural materials are sparse and scattered within the Holocene
alluvium along the eastern edge of the site. There, artifacts range in depth from 0
to 75 cm below the surface, stopping just above the boundary with the Cretaceous
bedrock or late Pleistocene alluvium. Artifacts observed in the trench walls consisted
of five scattered fire-cracked rocks in Trench 1 at 50â75 cm below the surface, a
70-cm-long lens of fire-cracked rocks in the upper 30 cm of the north wall of Trench
6, and a single lithic flake in the wall of Trench 10 at 24 cm below the surface.
Test Unit 1 was placed on Trench 6 to explore the fire-cracked rock lens.
Cultural materials were encountered in the unit from 10 to 40 cm below surface
with Feature 1, the fire-cracked rock concentration, at 20â27 cm. Test Unit 2 was
placed on Trench 1 to explore the scattered rocks seen in the walls. The only artifact
recovered was a Frio dart point from Level 3 at 20 to 30 cm below the surface.
Rabdotus sp. shell fragments were recovered throughout the levels of both units.
It is not certain that they are cultural, however. No mussel shell fragments were
recovered from this site. Judging from Test Unit 1, cultural materials are most
abundant at 20â30 cm below the surface and then decrease in the level just above
the Ck soil horizon (Table 3). All cultural materials recovered came from the late
Holocene alluvium.
Feature
Feature 1, a concentration of fire-cracked
rocks, was found in the upper 30 cm of the north
wall of Trench 6. The top of the feature was defined
in the southeast corner of Test Unit 1 at 20 cm
below the surface (Figure 4), and it extended to
27 cm below the surface. Scattered fire-cracked
rocks surrounded the main concentration. It
is loosely circular and measures 44 cm northsouth by 46 cm east-west. Signs of burning were
limited to the rocks alone. None of the rocks
appeared to be cracked in situ, and no charcoal or
soil discoloration was noted that would indicate
burning around the rocks or in a surrounding pit.
The sediments surrounding the rocks and in the
unit level are dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty
clay loam and are consistent with the Holocene
alluvium described in the trench wall.

Figure 4
National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine

Figure 4. View to the north of the top of Feature 1 exposed in Test Unit 1 at 41MV149.

A total of 54 burned rocks were associated with Feature 1. They were
small, with 50 percent less than 5 cm in diameter and 50 percent being 5â10 cm.
Fire-cracked rocks recovered from the levels above and below the feature were
consistently small at 90â100 percent less than 5 cm in diameter. The rocks from
the feature and the unit levels consisted of chert, limestone, and sandstone cobbles
much like what occurs on the surface in upslope parts of the site. The two pieces of
debitage recovered from Level 3 came from the level fill and not the feature fill. At
best, this feature may be considered a disarticulated hearth like those seen on the
surface by previous investigators (Watkins and Nash 2009:18â21). The facts that
there are no rocks broken in situ and no other evidence of burning indicate that
Feature 1 has limited integrity.
Materials Recovered
A total of 178 fire-cracked rocks (including Feature 1), 8 pieces of debitage, 1
Frio dart point, and 51 Rabdotus sp. snail shell fragments were recovered from the
two test units. The snail shells likely are natural occurrences rather than cultural. In
addition, 1 Pedernales dart point was recovered from the surface between Trenches
1 and 3. As described above, the fire-cracked rocks are mostly small fragments
less than 5 cm in diameter and are derived from Uvalde Gravels that occur as lag
deposits in upslope parts of the site.

Chapter 4: Results of Testing

25

Debitage
The eight pieces of debitage, all from Test Unit 1, consist of six flakes and
two chips. Three flakes and one chip display dorsal cortex, and one of the flakes is
large enough to distinguish pebble cortex. Five flakes and two chips are of Edwards
chert, and one flake is a dark gray chert that does not fluoresce under a black light.
Only one Edwards chert flake and the dark gray chert flake show indications of being
heated. Although this sample is small, the dominance of Edwards chert suggests
that this material was selected for its chipping qualities out of the Uvalde Gravels
eroding from the valley wall at the site.
Projectile Points
The two diagnostic dart points recovered indicate
that the site has multiple components reflecting a long
but sporadic history of occupation. The Frio dart point,
recovered from Level 3 of Test Unit 2, is manufactured
from heat-treated gray Edwards chert (Figure 5a). The
stem is side notched with concave basal edges and flaring
stem ears. This dart has been resharpened, and it has a
distal impact fracture. Frio is a Late Archaic style across
all of central and southwest Texas (Collins 2004:113;
Hester 2004:140; Turner et al. 2011:106). The Pedernales
point (Figure 5b), a surface find, is manufactured from
heat-treated cream or light tan Edwards chert. The
stem is parallel to slightly contracting with straight
lateral edges and a convex basal edge. One stem face has
multiple longitudinal thinning flakes. The blade edges
near the shoulders are broken and reworked, and one
edge is slightly beveled by pressure flaking. Pedernales
is a Middle Archaic dart point style that has been dated
to ca. 2500â3500 b.p. (Collins 2004:113; Turner et al.
2011:148â149).

Summary and Assessment
Most of 41MV149 has Uvalde Gravels intermixed with a few stone tools,
cores, debitage, and rock hearths scattered across an eroded upland surface.
Previous investigators concluded that it is a prehistoric open campsite and lithic
procurement location with little capacity to contain important information. They did
determine that the downslope south and east edges could contain buried features
and interpretable artifact samples, and the testing investigations reported here
focused on this area.
The test excavations, consisting of 10 backhoe trenches and 2 test units,
found one cultural feature and sparse artifacts at depths of 0â75 cm in late Holocene
alluvium with most materials in the upper 30 cm. The cultural materials recovered
are mostly fire-cracked rocks (n = 178), with very little debitage (n = 8) and two

26

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
dart points. Feature 1 is a concentration of fire-cracked rocks, likely a disarticulated
hearth without any evidence for in situ burning. The excavations yielded no floral
or faunal remains, other than snail shells that probably are noncultural. Hence,
there are no radiocarbon dates to determine when the site was occupied. The Frio
and Pedernales dart points suggest at least two occupations during the Late and
Middle Archaic periods, but the site could have been used at other times as well.
Site 41MV149 is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places because, with such sparse, shallowly buried cultural deposits and
no organic remains, it does not have datable components that could be isolated and
interpreted in any meaningful way. Further, the lack of floral and faunal data means
there is no evidence concerning Native American subsistence practices. Hence, it
lacks important information for understanding Native American use of the Elm
Creek valley.
41MV185
Site Setting
Site 41MV185 is in the north-central section of the Eagle Pass Mine permit
area on a south-facing slope of a T1 terrace above the main channel of Elm Creek.
Elevations range from 772 ft on the northern upslope side to 768 ft on the southern
downslope side (Figure 6). The main channel of Elm Creek forms the eastern
boundary of the site, and an unnamed tributary, considered to be a paleochannel of
Elm Creek, forms the southern and western boundaries. Large gullies that empty
into Elm Creek are causing extensive erosion along the eastern side of the site,
which is within the Elm Creek Protection Plan buffer zone and is protected from
disturbance by mining. Mining activities will impact the western two-thirds of the
site, and this area was tested.
Mesquite and acacia trees with an open understory of grasses and shrubs
form the vegetative cover in the western third of the site. These trees follow the
west side of a two-track ranch road that cuts the site from north to south. On the
east side of the road, the site supports a combination of mesquite and acacia scrub,
prickly pear and other cacti, and grasses. Dense trees and scrub grow along Elm
Creek and its tributary. Ground surface visibility is moderate (50 percent) in most
of the vegetated areas of the site and good (90 percent) in the road and around the
eroding heads of the gullies.
Previous Investigations
Initial work at 41MV185, done in 1992 by the Center for Archaeological
Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio and again in 1993 by Archeological
Consultants, Inc., defined the site as a burned rock midden some 50 cm deep within
alluvium on a natural levee of Elm Creek (Turner et al. 2015:21; Uecker 1994:35â37).
Diagnostic artifacts observed consisted of Castroville, Conejo, Edgewood, Matamoros,
Palmillas, and Pedernales dart points and an arrow point preform. Subsequent
investigations in 2012, which included excavation of two backhoe trenches and a
geomorphic assessment, defined a site area of 165 m northwest-southeast by 80 m

northeast-southwest based on a moderate surface scatter of artifacts. One trench
on the edge of the floodplain of the western paleochannel failed to produce any
cultural materials. The second trench on the terrace tread near the center of the
site confirmed the depth of the cultural deposit at 45 cm below the surface (Turner
et al. 2015:22). No features were encountered in this trench, but multiple possible
occupational surfaces were noted at 17â23, 28, and 40â44 cm below the surface
within late Holocene alluvium (Turner et al. 2015:25â27). These were defined
based on the depths of cultural materials observed in the wall of the trench. The
site was considered to have the potential to contain important information, but
no further work was recommended due to its similarity to nearby sites 41MV318
and 41MV319, which were thought to have a greater potential for buried features
(Turner et al. 2015:27). However, subsequent review of that report by Prewitt and
Associates, Inc., preparatory to submittal of the draft report to the Texas Historical
Commission concluded that 41MV185 needed additional work for a full National
Register assessment, with that work focusing on the terrace tread in the western
two-thirds of the site (Fields 2015).
Work Accomplished
Test excavations consisted of 11 backhoe trenches, 2 test units (1x1 m),
intensive surface scrutiny for diagnostic artifacts and features, and geomorphic
reassessment. The trenches, oriented generally east-west, ranged in length from
6.5 to 8.5 m and were 0.7â1.1 m deep. Artifacts were observed in the walls of
Trenches 2, 4â6, 10, and 11. These artifacts, mostly fire-cracked rocks, ranged in
depth from 10 to 70 cm below the surface. Detailed soil descriptions were made
for Trenches 2â5, 7, and 9â11. All trenches were photographed, and their locations
were mapped.
Test units were placed off of Trenches 10 and 11 to further explore the
materials noted there. Both test units were excavated to a depth of 70 cm below
the surface. In all, 1.4 m3 of sediment were excavated and screened from these
two units. No features were defined in the trenches or test units, but one possible
disarticulated hearth was noted eroding from the two-track road that crosses the
site. Also, several diagnostic artifacts were recovered from a large eroded area that
is at the head of the gully at the northern edge of the site.
Site Sediments
The T1 terrace on which 41MV185 is situated stands about 4 m above the
confluence of Elm Creek and the paleochannel that marks the siteâs southern and
western boundaries. The T1 surface between the two channels is mapped as Elindio
association, nearly level (Web Soil Survey 2017). Elindio soils are deep, well-drained,
Aridic Calciustolls formed in ancient calcareous alluvium (National Cooperative
Soil Survey 2017b).
The soil stratigraphy below the T1 surface, described in eight trenches (see
Appendix A), is similar from trench to trench across the site and consistent with
earlier observations made by Frederick in 2012 (see Turner et al. 2015). The T1

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
deposits consist of a thin (58â79 cm) mantle of fine-grained Holocene overbank
alluvium resting on weathered Cretaceous bedrock. The Holocene alluvium typically
exhibits an A-Bk soil profile (Figure 7). The A horizons are generally very dark
grayish brown (10YR 3/2) to very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay loam and silty clay
loam. The Bk horizons are typically well-structured grayish brown (10YR 5/2) to
dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam with common threads of calcium
carbonate (stage I carbonate morphology).
Figure 7

Figure 7. Photograph of a A-Bk soil profile on Holocene alluvium over weathered Cretaceous bedrock in Trench
5 at 41MV185.

In 2012, Frederick observed the sediments and stratigraphy below the T1
surface in only one trench (Turner et al. 2015). His limited observations and the
thin nature of the alluvial mantle made it difficult to assign a more-precise age on
the basis of soil formation other than Holocene. The examination of eight trench
profiles for the current investigations, as well as additional trench profiles on
T1 surfaces at nearby sites 41MV190 and 41MV202, suggests that the Holocene
alluvial deposits at 41MV185 are probably early to middle Holocene in age. This is
based on the consistent presence of a well-structured calcic B horizon below the T1
surface at 41MV190, as well as at the other two nearby sites that occupy the same
geomorphic surface. The interface between the early to middle Holocene alluvium
and the weathered bedrock is marked by a clear boundary. The weathered bedrock
typically exhibits a well-structured 2Bk horizon formed in light olive brown (2.5Y
5/3) silty clay loam with stage II carbonate morphology.

29

30

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
Erosion along the margins of the T1 terrace has resulted in concentrations of
cultural materials littering the surface. The dense concentrations of these materials
as lags probably provide an unrealistic view of the siteâs actual artifact density given
the meager recovery from hand excavations on the T1 surface.
Site Extent and Depth
Site 41MV185 originally was recorded as covering an area of 210 m
northwest-southeast by 105 m northeast-southwest, crossing Elm Creek to the east.
The 2012 investigations restricted the site to a 165x80-m area west of the creek
(Turner et al. 2015:22), and this is the area examined during testing. However,
surface inspection during the current project found artifacts in eroded areas on the
north and southwest edges of the site, indicating that 41MV185 actually is larger
in this dimension. In particular, including the large gully just north of the plotted
location would extend the site boundary about 60 m in this direction.

The vertical extent of 41MV185 was defined within the trenches and test units.
In the trenches, fire-cracked rocks and snail and mussel shell fragments were found
at depths from 10 to 70 cm below the surface, stopping just above the boundary with
the 2Bk horizon developed in weathered bedrock. Discrete occupational surfaces as
suggested during the 2012 investigations were not observed. Test Units 1 and 2 confirm
this, with debitage and fire-cracked rocks most abundant at 20â40 m in the former
and 30â60 cm in the latter (Table 4). Rabdotus sp. shell fragments were common only
in Test Unit 2, where their similar distribution to the fire-cracked rocks and debitage
implies they might be of cultural origin. The few mussel shell fragments have a similar
distribution and probably are cultural as well.
These distributions indicate that the cultural

Features
No cultural features were identified
in the trenches or test units, but a possible
disarticulated hearth was observed eroding
from the surface of the two-track road that
crosses the site (Figure 8). This fire-cracked
rock concentration is near the center of the
site on the downslope side of the road. The
road cut in this area is about 20 cm deep. The
feature was not excavated, but it appeared to
be roughly circular in outline and 50â60 cm
across. It is composed of mainly burned
sandstone and limestone cobble fragments not
greater than 10 cm in diameter. Some chert
debitage was noted in association with the
feature, but no diagnostic artifacts, charcoal,
or mussel shell were observed.

Materials Recovered
A total of 262 fire-cracked
rocks, 23 pieces of debitage, 1 chipped
stone core, 29 Rabdotus sp. snail shell
fragments, and 14 unidentified mussel
shell fragments were recovered from
screening the fill of the two test units.
In addition, 3 dart points and a bifacial
knife were recovered from the surface.
The fire-cracked rocks are mostly (68
percent) small fragments less than
5 cm in diameter, with the remainder
being 5â10 cm. They are of limestone,
sandstone, and chert and likely came
from nearby upland Uvalde Gravel
deposits or gravels transported to the
site area by Elm Creek.
Debitage and Core
The 23 pieces of debitage
consist of 14 flakes, 6 chips, and 3
chunks. Just over half (n = 12, 52
percent) exhibit cortex, and just less

it fluoresces under a black light. It
exhibits colors of white, light gray,
gray, brown, tan, or combinations of
these. Heated Edwards chert often appears to be purplish gray. The core is a cobble
fragment (5.5 cm maximum diameter) of light tan chert with weathered streamworn cortex on two faces; flakes were removed from multiple facets.
Projectile Points
The diagnostic artifacts are from the eroded surface at the gully head on
the northern edge of the site. They consist of two Frio dart points and a Martindale
dart point. The Frio points are fashioned from Edwards chert (Figure 9aâb). One is a
heat-treated off-white or cream color, and the other is mottled gray brown. Both are
side notched with concave stem basal edges and flaring stem ears. Both also appear
to be resharpened. Frio is a Late Archaic style that occurs across all of central and
southwest Texas (Collins 2004:113; Hester 2004:140; Turner et al. 2011:106). The
Martindale point is manufactured from heat-treated purple gray Edwards chert;
it is corner notched with a broad thin blade having convex lateral edges with wellcontrolled pressure flaking (Figure 9c). Its stem is expanding. Turner et al. (2011:132)
and Collins (2004:113) assign this style to the later part of the Early Archaic period.

Bifacial Knife
A complete bifacial knife also was recovered from the surface of the northern
eroded area (Figure 9d); it is not temporally diagnostic. It is fashioned from banded
gray to light gray Edwards chert that has not been heat treated. Its proximal end
and lateral edges are convex. It has been resharpened, but it retains edge rounding,
smoothing, and small bifacial microscars that are tell-tale signs of use as a cutting
tool.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41MV185, located on a T1 terrace between Elm Creek and one of its
paleochannels, likely represents a prehistoric open camp occupied at various times
during the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. Testing found archeological deposits
within Holocene alluvium, and these were explored with 11 backhoe trenches and
2 test units. The cultural materials recovered from 1.4 m3 of sediments excavated
from the test units consist of 262 fire-cracked rocks, 23 pieces of debitage, 1 core,
29 snail shell fragments, and 14 mussel shell fragments. These materials ranged in
depth from 0 to 70 cm below the surface with most materials above 60 cm. The low
debitage recovery suggests it would be difficult to obtain an interpretable artifact
sample from the site and points to the limited nature of the occupations. This is
emphasized by the fact that no tools were recovered from the excavations. The few
tools recovered, consisting of 2 Frio points, 1 Martindale point, and 1 bifacial knife,
were from the eroded modern ground surface, with the dart points indicating use
during the Late and Early Archaic periods; points found in previous investigations
indicate Middle Archaic and Late Prehistoric components as well. A concentration of
fire-cracked rocks possibly representing a disarticulated hearth was noted eroding
out at about 20 cm below the surface in the two-track road that crosses the site, but
no features were identified in the trenches or test units, suggesting that whatever
features are present are sparsely distributed.

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
With sparse artifacts in shallow subsurface contexts, no identified intact
subsurface features, and no temporally diagnostic artifacts from subsurface contexts,
it is impossible to isolate components that could be interpreted in any meaningful
way. In addition, no materials suitable for radiocarbon dating were found, preventing
firm determination of the ages of the occupations. Further, the lack of floral and
faunal data means there is no evidence concerning Native American subsistence
practices. Because of these limitations, the site lacks the ability to contribute
important information and is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places.
41MV189
Site Setting
Site 41MV189 is in the north-central section of the Eagle Pass Mine permit
area on the eastern slope of a T1 surface above a paleochannel that is likely a relict
channel of Elm Creek (Figure 10). This channel, approximately 250 m west of
the present channel of Elm Creek, contains ponded water and likely flows during
heavy rain events. Site 41MV190 is also positioned along this channel northwest
of 41MV189, and they likely are continuous scatters of debris. Site elevations at
41MV189 range from 775 ft at the edge of the terrace tread to 769 ft at the base of
the eastern slope. Mining activities will impact the entire site area, and thus all of
it was tested.
Vegetation consists of scattered mesquite and acacia trees with a dense
to moderate understory of grasses, shrubs, prickly pears, and other cacti with the
densest vegetation following the paleochannel. Ground surface visibility in the
dense vegetation is limited (30 percent), but there are eroded surface patches on
the slope where visibility is moderate to good (50â70 percent). A two-track road
runs east-west across the southern end of the site, and artifacts are eroding from
the road cut and gullies within the road. All of the diagnostic artifacts found during
these investigations came from the surface of this road. The road runs west to a
north-south road that crosses 41MV190. A deer feeder is present in the road near
the center of the site, and a corral and hunting stand are just off the site south of
the junction of the two roads.
Previous Investigations
Site 41MV189 was initially recorded in 1992 by the Center for Archaeological
Research (CAR) at the University of Texas at San Antonio (Turner et al. 2015:34â35;
Uecker 1994:42). That work found a dense surface scatter of fire-cracked rocks and
debitage covering an area of 15 by 50 m. Shovel testing and a single backhoe trench
determined that the cultural deposit extended from 20 to 40 cm below the surface. A
feature consisting of a 30x50-cm cluster âseveral hundred tertiary or biface thinning
flakesâ eroding from the surface was also excavated. Temporally diagnostic projectile
points recovered in association with the feature included an Ensor dart point and a
Perdiz arrow point. Other projectile points recovered from the surface included Bell,
Fairland, Figueroa, Frio, Langtry, Marcos, Paisano, Palmillas, Pedernales, and two

unidentified side-notched dart points along with a Scallorn arrow point. These points
suggested that the site has EarlyâLate Archaic and Late Prehistoric components.
Archeological investigations and a geomorphological assessment in 2012
expanded the site boundaries to 160 m north-south along the relict channel and
85 m east-west. These dimensions were based on a surface artifact scatter and the
excavation of three backhoe trenches. The trenches confirmed the shallow nature
of the deposits as defined by CAR (Turner et al. 2015:35â37). One trench (Trench
189-1b) in the southeast corner of the site encountered what appeared to be human
bones at 10 to 25 cm below the surface in the north wall of the trench. Though no
pit was discernible, the bones appeared to be part of a human burial. Work there
stopped, the feature was marked with wire and flagging tape to aid relocation, and
the trench was refilled to await consultation with the Texas Historical Commission.
Overall dimensions of Trench 189-1b as excavated were 3 m east-west by 0.6 m deep.
Trench 189-1a excavated 40 m west of Trench 189-1b on the terrace tread was 12 m
long and 2.5 m deep; fire-cracked rocks were noted in the trench at 25 cm below the
surface, but no additional burials or other features were found. The third trench
(Trench 189-2) was at the northern end of the site on the T1 slope; it produced no
buried artifacts, although artifacts were present on the surface. This trench was
14 m long and 1 m deep.
The 2012 investigation concluded that, because 41MV189 likely contained
at least one Native American burial, additional work was needed to determine
the nature and extent of these remains and whether other important remains
are present. Subsequent review of that report by Prewitt and Associates, Inc.,
preparatory to submittal of it to the Texas Historical Commission concurred with
that conclusion (Fields 2015).
Work Accomplished
Testing at 41MV189 consisted of seven backhoe trenches, a Gradall-stripped
area, four 1x1-m test units, intensive surface scrutiny for diagnostic artifacts, and
geomorphic reassessment. This work focused on two things: (1) determining if the site
contains one or more human burials and, if so, removing them; and (2) determining
if other parts of the site contain important archeological deposits. Six backhoe
trenches, oriented generally east-west, covered the slopes and the terrace tread;
they did not extend onto the floodplain of the relict channel. Trenches 2â7 ranged
in length from 6.0 to 8.0 m and were 0.8 to 1.1 m deep. Cleaning and recordation
identified artifacts in the walls of Trenches 2, 4, 5, and 7; artifacts were found as
deep as 50 cm below the surface, although most were in the upper 20 cm. Test Units
3 and 4 were excavated to a depth of 40 cm below the surface off of Trenches 2 and
4 to sample these deposits. Detailed sediment descriptions were made for all the
trenches, and all of them were photographed.
Trench 1 was opened to the south of the burial location (Feature 1), and
south of original Trench 189-1b to explore for additional interments. This trench
was 3.3 m wide, 12.0 m long, and 0.4 m deep. No additional burials were found in

35

36

this trench. Scattered debitage, fire-cracked rocks, and a few mussel shell fragments
were noted, mostly at the north end toward the burial location.
Trench 189-1b and the burial were re-located using a metal detector to find
the wire left to mark the burial on the north wall of the trench during the 2012
investigations (Figure 11). Test Units 1 and 2 were opened over the burial location
with 20 cm of both units extending south across the north wall of Trench 189-1b;
they were excavated to depths of 30â40 cm. The bones reported in the north wall of
Trench 189-1b were found, and the remainder of the burial was exposed, mapped,
photographed, and then removed, mainly from Test Unit 1 at 0â20 cm below the
surface. No additional burials or other features were defined on the surface or in
any of the trenches. To ensure that no additional burials were present, a Gradall

Site Sediments
Site 41MV189 is situated on the edge of a broad and nearly level T1 terrace
of Elm Creek and the slope interface between the T1 terrace and the floodplain (T0)
surface of the relict channel of Elm Creek that forms the eastern boundary of the
site. The T1 surface stands 4â5 m above the relict channel with a long gentle slope

Figure 12

to the floodplain. The National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) soils map does not
accurately distinguish between these different geomorphic surfaces. Such ambiguity
is common given that the resolution of these maps is too imprecise for the highresolution needs of site-specific geomorphology. In addition, local soils can vary at
much smaller scales than NCSS maps can depict. Regardless, both surfaces are
mapped as Elindio association, nearly level (Web Soil Survey 2017). Elindio soils
are deep, well-drained, Aridic Calciustolls formed in ancient calcareous alluvium
(National Cooperative Soil Survey 2017b).
Frederickâs original geomorphic assessment of the site found that the first
terrace is underlain by late Pleistocene to early Holocene alluvium with a C-AAB-Bk-Bky soil profile and a calcic B horizon (Turner et al. 2015:38â40). Cultural
material was present in the upper 10 cm of this profile in Trench 189-1a on the
upper slope of the terrace. A shallow C horizon was also noted and thought to be
derived from alluvium as slopewash. Its presence along with many artifacts on the
gentle slope suggested that cultural material was eroding from the terrace tread
and moving down slope. The great time range represented by the projectile points
recovered from the site, the shallowness of the cultural deposit, and great age of
the alluvium that comprises the terrace tread suggested that the artifacts present
were a palimpsest of site components.
The soil stratigraphy below the T1 surface was described in Trenches 3, 5,
and 6 and on the T1âT0 slope interface in Trenches 2, 4 and 7. The trenches show
T1 deposits consisting of a thin (30â60 cm) mantle of probable early to middle

37

38

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
Holocene fine-grained overbank alluvium (Figure 13a). The Holocene alluvium
typically exhibits an A-AB soil profile consisting of grayish brown (10YR 5/2) to
very dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam and silty clay loam. Below a clear
lower boundary, the B-Bk horizons are well-structured yellowish brown (10YR 5/4)
silty clay loam displaying stage I calcium carbonate morphology of common threads
and filaments. The trenches on the T1âT0 slope interface show a similar soil profile
except that B-Bk horizons exhibit more calcic masses indicative of Stage II carbonate
morphology (Figure 13b). The Stage II morphology suggests that these deposits are
Cretaceous bedrock or Pleistocene alluvium. In almost all the trench profiles, the
Holocene alluvium is blanketed by 9â15 cm of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy

The deposits and soil imprints observed below the T1 and T1âT0 slope
interface surfaces are similar to the earlier observations made by Frederick with
some differences in the proposed age of the sediments. Frederick did not observe
bedrock in the trenches at 41MV189 (Turner et al. 2015:Figure 22). Rather, he
characterized the oldest sediments at the site as late Pleistocene to early Holocene
in age. Examination of 12 trenches on the same geomorphic surfaces at nearby site

Chapter 4: Results of Testing

39

41MV190, of which 41MV189 may be a continuation, suggests that the Holocene
alluvial mantle at these sites is probably early to middle Holocene in age overlying
Cretaceous bedrock. This determination is based on the consistent presence of a
well-structured 2Bk horizon formed on yellowish brown or light olive brown silty
clay loam. Its common calcium carbonate filaments and soft masses represent stage
II carbonate morphology, and the interface between the early to middle Holocene
alluvium and the bedrock is marked by a clear boundary. The sediments in the
trenches at 41MV189 appear similar to what was seen at 41MV190. Whether the
Holocene alluvium at 41MV189 is underlain by Pleistocene alluvium or Cretaceous
bedrock is moot, though, given that the cultural materials at the site are so near the
surface and the underlying deposits are too old to contain archeological remains. As
elsewhere, erosion along the margins of the T1 terrace has resulted in concentrations
of cultural materials littering the T1âT0 slope interface, which provide an unrealistic
view of the siteâs actual artifact density given the meager recovery from hand
excavations on the T1 surface.
Site Extent and Depth
The present investigations did not
change the horizontal extent of the site as
defined in 2012. Within these dimensions,
the site appears oriented to the eastern relict
channel as marked by abundant artifacts on
the edge of the terrace tread and slopes as well
as the placement of Feature 1 on the terrace
slope adjacent to the floodplain of the relict
channel.
Artifacts were present on the surface
near all of trenches excavated, but only
Trenches 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 exhibited cultural
materials below the surface in their walls.
These trenches and the four test units define
the vertical extent of the site. The materials
observed in the trenches consist mainly of
fire-cracked rocks found at depths of 10â50 cm
below the surface. Materials recovered from
the test units consist of fire-cracked rocks,
debitage, snail shells, and a mussel shell
fragment, mostly from the upper 20 cm in
Test Units 3 and 4, along with Feature 1 in
the upper 23 cm of Test Units 1 and 2 (Table
5). The fact that most of the Rabdotus shells
co-occur with debitage or fire-cracked rocks
suggests that they too may be cultural.

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
Features
Although there were numerous pieces of fire-cracked rock on the surface
and some were observed in the trench walls and test units, no concentrations
suggesting hearth features were noted. The single feature defined, Feature 1, is the
burial originally encountered in the north wall of Trench 189-1b during the 2012
investigations (Turner et al. 2015:36â37). The feature was found at approximately
10 cm below the surface and extended no more than 30 cm below the surface. The
burial was defined as bone fragments, including possible human long bones, along
with a large rock extending for 1 m along the wall of the trench; no associated pit was
observed. After discovery, the feature was marked with wire and flagging tape, and
the trench was refilled to await consultation with the Texas Historical Commission.
In 2017, a metal detector was used to find the wires marking the burial
along the refilled trench wall. Then, enough of the burial was exposed to confidently
conclude that it was indeed human. A physical anthropologist, Ms. Brittany McClain,
was present to make this determination. Before total exposure and removal of
the burial took place, a petition was filed by the landowner, Kincaid Eagle Pass,
LLC, and the Dos Republicas Coal Partnership with the 365th Judicial District
of Maverick County, Texas for removal and relocation of the abandoned remains,
and a disinterment permit was obtained from Texas Department of State Health
Services (Appendix D). After nondestructive analysis (Appendix B), the burial was
reinterred at the Sunset Memorial Oaks Cemetery, a perpetual care cemetery, in
Val Verde County, Texas.
Feature 1 was fully exposed in Test Unit 1 with only 30 cm extending into
the southwest corner of the adjacent Test Unit 2. The top of the feature was at 10 cm
below the surface, and the base was at 23 cm; hence, most of it was in Levels 1 and
2 within the test units. The south walls of the units were oriented to the north wall
of Trench 189-1b, overlapping it by approximately 20 cm. The overlap insured that
the excavators would not miss any of the bones in the original trench wall. Upon
beginning excavations near the overlap, wires and yellow flagging tape were found
protruding from the original trench wall, and it quickly became clear that most of
the burial would be in Test Unit 1.
As excavation began in Test Unit 1, an area of burned clay measuring about
35x15 cm was encountered near the center of the unit at 7 cm below the surface
(Figure 14a). Approximately 15 cm south of the burned area was the rock noted by
the previous investigators in the wall of the original trench. Upon inspection, the rock,
which is sandstone with dimensions of 15x11x5 cm, was found to be fire cracked. It is
not worked and is probably is not a grave offering. Continued excavation exposed bone
around the burned clay, and at a depth of ca. 13 cm the crushed skull and mandible
were exposed just northwest of the burned area. Hence, the burned soil was over the
torso of the interment with some bones below showing signs of burning as well.
Full exposure of the interment indicated that there was one adult individual
(possibly female, see Appendix B) lying on the right side in a semiflexed position
with the head to the northwest (Figure 14b). The legs were not tightly flexed to
the abdomen, and as a result the knees and parts of the femurs, tibias, and fibulas

of both legs, as well as most of the bones of the left foot, were lost in the original
trench excavation. The right foot, however, was tucked up near the pelvis and was
partially intact. The bones of the pelvis, vertebral column, scapulas, and ribs were
extremely fragmentary. Where possible, these bones were separated from the soil
matrix surrounding them, but most fragments came out with the soil matrix, which
was bagged for reburial. No grave offerings were found with this individual, although
it is possible that the burned soil localized over the torso and the large fire-cracked
rock found nearby may represent a fire set above the interment as some form of
burial ritual. A sample of bone submitted to Beta Analytic, Inc., for radiocarbon
dating yielded a calibrated two-sigma date range of a.d. 1282â1396 (Appendix C),
indicating that the interment occurred during the Late Prehistoric period.
Materials Recovered
A total of 168 fire-cracked rocks, 61 pieces of debitage, 22 Rabdotus sp. snail
shell fragments, and 1 unidentified mussel shell fragment were recovered from
screening the fill of the four test units (see Table 5). In addition, materials recovered
from the surface of the east-west road across the site consist of 1 possible Bell dart
point preform, 1 Early Triangular dart point, 1 Ensor dart point, 1 Marcos dart
point, 2 bifaces, and 1 ground and battered stone.
The fire-cracked rocks were sized, counted, and discarded; they consisted of
mostly small fragments less than or equal to 5 cm in diameter, with a substantial
amount of burned rock shatter less than 2 cm in diameter in Levels 1 and 2 of Test
Unit 4. These rocks appeared to be cobble fragments and were identified as limestone,
sandstone, and chert. The source of this material is likely nearby Uvalde Gravels
eroding from the uplands or carried near the site area by Elm Creek. The snail and
mussel shell fragments from the test units were not collected; as these were few
and generally unidentifiable, they were simply counted.
Debitage
The 62 pieces of debitage, 61 from the test units and 1 from the surface,
consist of 19 flakes, 38 chips, and 5 chunks. Less than half (n = 22, 35 percent)
display exterior cortex, while more than half (n = 37, 60 percent) show evidence of
being heated or burned. Most of the material appears to be Edwards chert (n = 49,
79 percent), which fluoresces under ultraviolet light. Edwards chert exhibits colors
of white, cream, tan, brown, light gray, gray, or a combination of these. Heated
Edwards chert is often purple gray or pink. Other materials in the sample include
chert that does not fluoresce (n = 7), ingenious rock (n = 4), and quartzite (n = 2).
Projectile Points
The Early Triangular dart point is manufactured from brown Edwards chert
that has not been heat treated (Figure 15a). The basal edge is slightly convex and
well thinned by removal of longitudinal percussion flakes on both faces. The blade
edges are slightly convex and beveled toward the tip. This style is characteristic of
the Early Archaic period.

The Ensor dart point is manufactured from cream-colored Edwards chert
that is not heat treated (Figure 15b). The stem is side notched and exhibits a very
slight concavity to the basal edge. Blade lateral edges are convex, and the distal
tip appears to have been slightly reworked by pressure flaking. The Ensor style is
associated with the Late Archaic period.
The Marcos dart point appears to be reworked (Figure 15c). The distal end
has been flaked into a drill tip that is broken in a bending fracture, probably from
use. The point is manufactured of dark gray to black chert with somewhat lighter
gray inclusions, perhaps chalcedony. It does not appear to be heat treated. The
Marcos point type is characteristic of the Late Archaic period.
The dart point preform represents a proximal-medial fragment broken in a
transverse bending fracture (Figure 15d). Its raw material is light gray chert that
does not appear to have been heat treated. A portion of the ventral surface of the

43

44

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
original flake blank is still present on one face. The stem is short in relation to the
blade size and width and has initial beginnings of basal notches. The stem basal
and lateral edges are straight. Based on the stem characteristics and beginnings
of basal notches, it is possible that this preform fragment represents an incomplete
Bell dart point of the Early Archaic period.
Other Bifaces
Two other bifaces were recovered. One is a small thick biface of Edwards chert
manufactured from a hard-hammer percussion flake (Figure 15e). The raw material
does not appear to have been heat treated. A portion of the ventral surface is still
visible, but the bulb of percussion and striking platform have been removed. The
biface is roughly triangular in cross section with convex lateral edges and a rounded
base. The distal point is also triangular in cross section. While this artifact could
represent a biface discarded because it could not be sufficiently thinned, the cross
section shape and characteristics of the distal end suggest it could have functioned
as a graver or perforator as well.
The other biface is a thick oval specimen manufactured of heat-treated
Edwards chert (Figure 15f). Remnant dorsal cortex indicates that it may have
been manufactured from a percussion flake or small chert cobble. The cortex is
stream worn. The cross section is planoconvex. The oval shape and cross section
suggest that this biface may be a discarded preform of one of the several types of
distally beveled bifaces that occur in the region associated with the Middle and
Late Archaic periods.
Ground and Battered Tool
The single ground and battered tool is a large oviod limestone rock with fossil
inclusions appearing on both dorsal and ventral surfaces (Figure 16). The ventral
surface is relatively flat and appears to have been smoothed through repeated use.
The dorsal surface is convex and does not appear to be smoothed. The edges of the

Summary and Assessment
Site 41MV189, situated on a T1 terrace and the T1âT0 slope interface along a
relict channel of Elm Creek, represents a prehistoric open camp occupied at various
times through the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. In all, seven backhoe
trenches, one Gradall-stripped area, and four 1x1-m test units were excavated.
The cultural materials encountered, including fire-cracked rocks, debitage, and one
human burial, were found to be mainly near the surface in the upper 20â30 cm of a
Holocene alluvial mantle over Cretaceous bedrock or Pleistocene alluvium. These
near-surface materials were found to be extensively eroding from the terrace edge
where numerous diagnostic projectile points were recovered during the current and
previous investigations. The great span of time represented by these diagnostic
artifacts suggests that multiple occupations over thousands of years of prehistory
have been conflated within the site sediments.

The cultural materials recovered from the test units consist of 168 firecracked rocks, 61 pieces of debitage, 22 snail shell fragments, and 1 mussel shell
fragment. The limited artifact recovery indicates that it would be difficult to acquire
interpretable artifact samples from the site components, even if it were possible

45

to separate the components. In addition, no stone tools were recovered from the
test units, but rather all were from surface contexts. Artifacts recovered from the
surface are a Marcos dart point reworked into a drill, an Early Triangular dart point,
an Ensor dart point, a Bell dart point preform, a bifacial adze preform, a bifacial
graver or perforator, and a single ground stone tool. The temporally diagnostic items
indicate occupations during the Early and Late Archaic periods, with points found
in previous investigations also including Middle Archaic and Late Prehistoric forms.
Although previous investigations had found a chipped stone debris pile
feature apparently intact on and near the surface, the present investigations
found only scattered fire-cracked rocks and debitage on the surface suggesting
that rock hearths and other features that once may have been present are now
destroyed or damaged by erosion. Even Feature 1, a human burial re-located and
removed during these investigations, was much deteriorated and crushed due to
its close proximity to the surface. No grave offerings were found with the burial,
but the burned soil present above its abdomen suggests that some burial ritual was
involved. Radiocarbon dating of bone from the burial indicates that it dates to the
Late Prehistoric period. The burial was isolated with no others around it, indicating
it was not part of a cemetery.
With sparse artifacts and no temporally diagnostic artifacts shallowly buried
in Holocene alluvium and clearly conflated surface remains representing thousands
of years of use, it is impossible to isolate components that could be interpreted in any
meaningful way. In addition, no materials suitable for radiocarbon dating other than
the bones in Feature 1 were found, preventing firm determination of the ages of the
occupations. Further, the lack of floral and faunal data means there is no evidence
concerning Native American subsistence practices. Because of these limitations, the
site lacks the ability to contribute important information and is considered ineligible
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
41MV190
Site Setting
Site 41MV190 is in the north-central section of the Eagle Pass Mine permit
area on a broad level T1 surface approximately 250 m west of the present channel of
Elm Creek. The site sits between two paleochannels of Elm Creek, a larger one to the
west and a smaller one to the east; these channels at times carry water. Elevations
range from 777 ft on the terrace tread to 765 ft at the base of the western slope
(Figure 17). Mining activities are projected to impact the entire site area.
Vegetation on the terrace tread consists of scattered mesquite and acacia
trees with a dense to moderate understory of grasses, shrubs, prickly pears, and
other cacti. Dense vegetation follows the terrace slopes down to the paleochannels.
Ground surface visibility in the dense vegetation is limited (30 percent), but there are
eroded surface patches on the terrace tread and slopes where visibility is moderate
to good (50â70 percent). A two-track road runs north-south on the east side of the
terrace, and artifacts are present eroding from the road cut. Four main areas of
surface artifacts were noted (see Figure 17).

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
Previous Investigations
Site 41MV190 was initially recorded in 1992 by the Center for Archaeological
Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio (Turner et al. 2015:42â43;
Uecker 1994:23, 46, 54). That work, which included shovel tests and a substantial
number of auger tests (n = 92), found that artifacts extend to a depth of 50 cm below
the surface. Still, much of the material, which included dart points typed as Frio,
Marcos, Pandora, and Tortugas associated mostly with the Late Archaic period, was
recovered near the surface or eroding from the surface, especially along the eastern
slope of the landform (Turner et al. 2015:21).
Additional investigations and a geomorphological assessment conducted
in 2012 included surface inspection and excavation of three backhoe trenches; two
trenches were placed on the terrace tread, and one was on the floodplain of the
western paleochannel (Turner et al. 2015:43â47). These investigations defined a
site area of 525 m north-south and 210 m east-west based on the observed surface
scatter of artifacts and the previous investigatorâs subsurface testing. Much firecracked rock and debitage was observed on the slope of the western paleochannel
and south along the two-track road as it approaches the slope of the eastern channel.
Limited artifacts were observed on the surface of the intervening terrace tread.
However, the two trenches on the terrace tread did encounter cultural materials,
and the trench on the floodplain did not. Artifacts in these trenches were noted as
âmeagerâ or âminimal,â and no features were defined (Turner et al.2015:43).
The geomorphic investigations found that the trenches on the terrace tread
showed a mantle (ca. 60 cm thick) of fine-grained overbank alluvium resting directly
on bedrock marked by pedogenic calcium carbonate and gypsum (Turner et al.
2015:44â46). The alluvial mantle was considered to be Holocene in age. The results
of these investigations suggested that the site is mainly surficial or shallowly buried,
with materials in such low density that they have limited visibility in subsurface
exposures (Turner et al. 2015:46). Because of the apparently low density of buried
materials, the site was considered unlikely to contribute important information to
an understanding of south Texas prehistory (Turner et al. 2015:70), and no further
work was recommended. Subsequent review of that report by Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., preparatory to submittal of it to the Texas Historical Commission disagreed
with this recommendation, arguing that more work was needed to assess this very
large site (Fields 2015).
Work Accomplished
Test excavations consisted of 27 backhoe trenches, 7 test units (1x1 m),
intensive surface scrutiny for diagnostic artifacts, and geomorphic reassessment.
This work was directed at determining if there are intact buried features and
associated materials. The 27 trenches, oriented generally east-west, covered the
slopes and top of the terrace tread between the two paleochannels; they were not
placed on the floodplains of those channels (see Figure 17). The trenches ranged
in length from 6.0 to 12.6 m with an average of 8.8 m and were 0.7 to 1.1 m deep.
Cleaning and recording showed that 14 (Trenches 5, 6, 8â11, 13, 16, 18â20, 23, 24,

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
and 27) had artifacts in their walls. Detailed soil descriptions were made for 16
trenches (Trenches 1â13, 15, 16, and 19). All trenches were photographed and their
locations mapped.
The seven test units were placed off of seven trenches: Test Unit 1 on Trench
3, Test Unit 2 on Trench 9, Test Unit 3 on Trench 19, Test Unit 4 on Trench 18, Test
Unit 5 on Trench 10, Test Unit 6 on Trench 8, and Test Unit 7 on Trench 13. Test
units where located were artifacts were observed in the walls of the trenches and
where substantial materials were present on the surface. Test units were excavated
to the underlying bedrock or to where artifact counts significantly dropped; unit
depth ranged from of 30 to 60 cm below the surface. In all, 3.0 m3 of sediment were
excavated and screened from these units.
Only one feature, a fire-cracked rock concentration, was defined in all the
test units and trenches. The feature was recorded in Test Unit 3 at 10 cm below the
surface. Several possible disarticulated hearths were also noted in three areas with
substantial scattered fire-cracked rocks and debitage eroding from the surface, but
these were not designated as features. Two of these surface artifact scatters (Areas 1
and 2) are along the western edge of the landform extending down the terrace slope
(see Figure 17). The third (Area 3) is on the eastern edge of the landform overlooking
the eastern paleochannel, extending east beyond the original site boundary. A
fourth scatter (Area 4) was noted on the terrace tread along the north-south road.
Several time-diagnostic projectile points, as well as chipped and ground stone tools,
were recovered from these areas. These large surface scatters indicate that the site
occupies the whole landform between the two paleochannels.
Site Sediments
Site 41MV190 is situated on a broad and nearly level T1 terrace of Elm
Creek and the slope interface between the T1 terrace and the lower floodplain (T0)
surface. These landforms are situated between two paleochannels that form the
eastern and western boundaries of the site. The T1 surface stands 4â5 m above the
western channel, which is probably an abandoned course of Elm Creek. The National
Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) soils map does not accurately distinguish between
these different geomorphic surfaces. Such ambiguity is common given that the
resolution of these maps is too imprecise for the high-resolution needs of site-specific
geomorphology. In addition, local soils can vary at much smaller scales than NCSS
maps can depict. Regardless, both surfaces are mapped as Elindio association, nearly
level (Web Soil Survey 2017). Elindio soils are deep, well-drained, Aridic Calciustolls
formed in ancient calcareous alluvium (National Cooperative Soil Survey 2017b).
The soil stratigraphy below the T1 surface was described in 12 trenches, and
4 trench profiles on the T1âT0 slope interface were described (see Appendix A). The
deposits and soil imprints observed below the T1 surface are similar to and consistent
with observations made by Frederick in 2012 (see Turner et al. 2015). The T1 deposits
consist of a thin (54â76 cm) mantle of fine-grained Holocene overbank alluvium
resting on weathered Cretaceous bedrock. The Holocene alluvium typically exhibits
an A-Bk soil profile (Figure 18). The A horizons consist of dark grayish brown (10YR

49

50

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
4/2) to very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam.
The Bk horizons are well-structured grayish brown (10YR 5/2) to dark grayish brown
(10YR 4/2) silty clay loam displaying Stage I carbonate morphology of a few common
threads and filaments. In a few trench profiles, this soil is blanketed by 3â7 cm of
pale brown (10YR 6/3), brown (10YR 4/3), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loamy
sand representing recent, but local, sheetwash and possibly eolian sediments.
Frederick observed the sediments and stratigraphy below the T1 surface
at 41MV190 in only one trench. His limited observations and the thinness of the
alluvial mantle made it difficult to assign a more-precise age on the basis of soil
formation other than Holocene. The examination of 12 trench profiles for the current
investigations, as well as additional trench profiles on T1 surfaces at nearby sites
41MV185 and 41MV202, suggests that the Holocene alluvial mantle at 41MV190 is
probably early to middle Holocene in age. This is based on the consistent presence
of a well-structured calcic B horizon below the T1 surface at 41MV190, as well as at
the other two nearby sites that occupy the same geomorphic surface. The interface
between the early to middle Holocene alluvium and the weathered bedrock is marked
by a clear boundary. The bedrock is typically a well-structured 2Bk horizon formed
on light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3 or 5/4) silty clay loam. Its common calcium carbonate
filaments and soft masses represent stage II carbonate morphology.
The soil stratigraphy observed in the profiles of the trenches on the T1âT0
slope interface does not differ much from that below the T1 surface. The main
difference is that the A horizon is either deflated through erosion (e.g., Trench 11;
Figure 18b), buried by recent slope alluvium (e.g., Trench 8), or completely removed
and replaced with recent or late Holocene slope alluvium overlying Cretaceous
bedrock (e.g., Trench 13). The erosional processes at work along the margins of the
T1 terrace have resulted in concentrations of cultural materials littering the T1âT0
slope interface (Figure 19). The dense concentrations of these materials as lags are
probably an unrealistic view of the siteâs actual artifact density given the meager
recovery from hand excavations on the T1 surface.
Site Extent and Depth
The present investigations found cultural materials across an area of about
500 m north-south and 300 m east-west, extending a bit east of the site boundary
determined in 2012 (see Figure 17). The site appears to be oriented to both the
eastern and western paleochannels where abundant artifacts occur on the eroded
terrace surface and slopes. However, the 14 trenches that produced artifacts suggest
a stronger orientation to the western channel and to the terrace tread at the center
of the site. Artifact-producing trenches do not correspond well with the surface
artifact areas on the east side of the site.
The 14 positive trenches and 7 test units excavated define the vertical extent
of the site. The materials observed in the trenches consist of fire-cracked rocks,
debitage, and mussel shell fragments, which were found at depths of 10â80 cm below
the surface. Snail shell fragments were also noted in the trench walls and recovered

from the unit levels, but they are less certain to be cultural and thus potentially
less informative about the depth of the cultural deposits.
The seven test units show that most of the cultural materials are in the upper
30 cm across the site, which corresponds well with Ab horizon within the Holocene
alluvium (Table 6). A single exception is Test Unit 2 on Trench 9; in this unit, the
majority of materials were recovered at 30â60 cm below the surface extending into
the Bwk soil horizon within the Holocene alluvium and stopping above the weathered
bedrock. The deeper cultural materials in Test Unit 2 are fire-cracked rocks and
snail shells. These could represent a less-eroded deposit than that represented by
the near-surface materials elsewhere, potentially correlating with a few fire-cracked
rocks found at 60â80 cm below the surface in Trenches 5, 8, and 20.
Features
A fire-cracked rock concentration was the single feature found (Figure 20).
It was identified in Test Unit 3 on Trench 19. The top was at 4 cm below the surface,
and the base was at 13 cm; hence, most of the feature was in Level 1. The dimensions
of the concentration, excluding 3 rocks exposed near the unit wall, are 40 cm north-

south by 55 cm east-west. No charcoal or other evidence of burning was noted, nor
was there any evidence of a surrounding pit. A few mussel shell fragments (not
collected) were noted on the west side of the feature. The matrix surrounding the
feature rocks consisted of dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay loam. A total 16 rocks are
associated with the feature; these range in size from 5 to 10 cm and are chert and
limestone cobble fragments. Recovery from Level 1 surrounding the feature consists
of 32 fire-cracked rocks, 6 pieces of debitage, and 3 Rabdotus snail shell fragments.
This feature is likely a disarticulated hearth eroding from near-surface sediments.
Several other concentrations of burned rocks, also likely representing
disarticulated hearths, were noted eroding at the surface but not given feature
numbers. One was in the northern surface artifact scatter (Area 1) in the vicinity
of Trench 19, and another was in the easternmost surface artifact scatter (Area 3)
near Trench 12. Both can be characterized as loose concentrations of fire-cracked
rocks and debitage approximately 50 to 70 m in diameter (Figure 21).

Materials Recovered
A total of 204 fire-cracked rocks, 52 pieces of debitage, 1 biface fragment,
105 Rabdotus sp. snail shell fragments, and 44 unidentified mussel shell fragments
were recovered from screening the fill of the seven test units (see Table 6). Additional
materials recovered from the artifact scatter areas and the site surface are 2 cores,
3 Ensor dart points, 1 Marshall dart point, 1 untyped arrow point, 1 Dimmitt tool,
and 1 ground stone axe fragment.
The fire-cracked rocks from the test units were sized, counted, and discarded;
they consist of mostly small fragments less than or equal to 5 cm in diameter, with
none larger than 10 cm. These rocks appeared to be cobble fragments and were
identified as limestone, sandstone, and chert. The source of this material is likely
nearby Uvalde Gravels eroding from the uplands or carried near the site area by
Elm Creek.
Debitage
The debitage consists of 25 flakes, 19 chips, and 8 chunks. Less than half
(n = 23, 44 percent) displays exterior cortex, while almost two-thirds (n = 33, 63
percent) show evidence of being heated or burned. Most of the material appears

to be Edwards chert (n = 43, 83 percent), which fluoresces under ultraviolet light.
Edwards chert exhibits colors of white, cream, tan, brown, light gray, and gray or
a combination of these. Heated Edwards chert is often purple gray or pink. Other
materials in this sample include chert that does not fluoresce (n = 4), igneous rock
(n = 2), quartzite (n = 2), and petrified wood (n = 1).
Cores
Two small microflake cores were collected from the surface artifact scatter
in Area 3. Each is a small chert pebble or fragment of a larger cobble with a singlefaceted striking platform from which a series of small percussion flakes have been
removed around a portion of the periphery. These do not appear to be exhausted
cores but rather specialized for the production of small flakes that would be useful
for gravers, small drills, or small cutting tools. The specialized form of these cores
is the reason they were collected.
Projectile Points
Two of the Ensor dart points were recovered from the southeastern terrace
edge in Area 4, and the third was found on the northwest eroding slope in Area 1.

55

56

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
All are fashioned from Edwards chert, and two are heat treated (Figure 22a). Chert
color for the nonheated specimen is cream with gray bands or mottling (Figure
22b). These points have side-notched stems, which are characteristic of the region
extending from the lower Pecos River to San Antonio (Turner et al. 2011:94). All
three points are complete, although they are heavily resharpened. The basal stem
edge is straight on one of the points and concave on the other two. The Ensor point
not pictured in Figure 22 has a distal impact fracture and is exhausted. The Ensor
dart point type is a Late Archaic style across all of central and southwest Texas
(Collins 2004:113; Hester 2004:140; Turner et al. 2011:94).

A fragmentary dart point provisionally identified as a Marshall was recovered
from the surface in Area 1. It is a late-stage preform failure manufactured from
heat-treated off-white to cream Edwards chert (Figure 22c). The blade is broken
in a transverse bending fracture (end shock), and small portions of the barbs are
missing. It is considered a preform fragment because the blade edges are still
sinuous with no pressure flaking. The stem is corner notched and expanding, and
the basal edge is straight.
Another surface find coming from the northwestern slope in Area 1 is a
subtriangular to ovate small pressure-flaked preform or unstemmed arrow point
fashioned from Edwards chert (Figure 22d). It has a convex basal edge and straight
lateral edges. This artifact indicates there is a Late Prehistoric component at the site.
Bifaces
Among the formal tools is one small distally beveled triangular biface that
likely is a specialized hafted woodworking implement identifed as a Dimmitt tool
(Figure 23a). The tool was recovered from the center of the site near Trench 9. It is
fashioned from a thick percussion flake of gray rhyolite or some other type of igneous

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
extrusive like basalt or andesite. The bulb of percussion and striking platform have
been trimmed away, and all the edges are very slightly convex and have been very
carefully retouched by unifacial soft-hammer percussion. Edge wear includes slight
edge rounding and occasional microscars with feather-and-step terminations onto
the dorsal aspect and development of a matte to medium polish on the ventral aspect
of the edge. This type of wear is commonly associated with implements that have
been employed in scraping tasks, particularly in scraping softer materials like soft
wood and plant materials.
Similar tool forms have been reported by Hall et al. (1986) from their work
at Choke Canyon Reservoir in south Texas as well as by Dockall (1998:172) for a
series of 11 sites along Sacatosa Creek near Laughlin Air Force Base in Val Verde
County. Other distally beveled tools similar in form are Clear Fork unifaces and

Fork tool and has an overthickened cross section with its greatest thickness just
behind the bevel, and it has a pointed proximal end. Hester (2004:139, Figure 4.14)
describes a similar type of bifacial or unifacial tool as the Dimmitt form or scraper
(see also Nunley and Hester 1966; Tomka 2002:83â84). Hester et al. (1969:152) note
that these tools are distributed across an area along the Rio Grande from Eagle Pass
to Falcon Reservoir including the five counties of Dimmitt, Maverick, Starr, Webb,
and Zapata. These tools may have great time depth but are thought to be mainly
associated with the Middle Archaic period (Hester 2004:149).
A single indeterminate biface fragment was recovered from Test Unit 3,
Level 3. It was manufactured from mottled gray/brown Edwards chert that was
not heat treated.
Ground Stone
A ground stone celt or axe fragment was collected from the eroding terrace
edge in Area 4. It is a bit or blade portion manufactured from coarse-grained igneous
rock (Figure 23b). The cross section is subrectangular with left, right, upper, and
lower bit faces present. The artifact broke across the bit or blade, and there is some
impact damage at the bit edge. The polished and ground surfaces on this artifact are
easily distinguished from stream-worn or otherwise weathered surfaces. Although
the origin of both the raw material and artifact type for this piece are not known,
grooved ground stone axes and celts are known from northern and eastern Mexico,
particularly Chihuahua and Coahuila. Mitchell (1975) reports on ground stone celt
or celt-like objects from LaSalle and Cameron Counties and three-quarter grooved
axes from Nueces and Dimmitt Counties.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41MV190, situated on a T1 terrace and the T1âT0 slope interface
between two paleochannels of Elm Creek, likely represents a prehistoric open camp
occupied at various times through the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. The
testing consisted of 27 backhoe trenches and 7 test units. The cultural materials
encountered, including fire-cracked rock features, were mainly near the surface
and in the upper 30 cm of a Holocene alluvial mantle over weathered bedrock.
Near-surface materials were found to be eroding extensively in four main areas
along the terrace edges. The numerous artifacts observed in these areas are likely
the result of multiple occupations over a long site history that have been conflated
by erosion.
The cultural materials recovered from the test units consist of 204 firecracked rocks, 52 pieces of debitage, 1 biface fragment, 105 snail shell fragments,
and 44 mussel shell fragments. The low artifact density suggests that it would
be difficult to acquire interpretable artifact samples, even if discrete components
could be isolated. This is emphasized by the fact that only 1 chipped stone tool was
recovered from the test units. Artifacts recovered from the surface consist of 4 dart
points, 1 arrow point, 1 Dimmitt adze, 1 ground stone axe or celt fragment, and
2 cores. The dart points and arrow point indicate occupations during the Middle

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
and Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, with Late Archaic use confirmed by
points found during previous investigations.
One feature was identified in Test Unit 3 at 10 cm below the surface, and
others were seen at the surface in eroded areas. The features are concentrations of
fire-cracked rocks that probably represent hearths. They indicate cooking or other
processing activities but otherwise are not very informative. No botanical remains
and only limited faunal remains in the form of snail and mussel shell fragments
were found. The sparseness of remains of all sorts means there is little evidence on
which to base a reconstruction of daily life of the occupants or provide material for
radiocarbon dating. Without dates to associate features, diagnostic artifacts, and
artifact samples with particular components, the interpretive value of this site is low.
Hence, it is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
41MV202
Site Setting
Site 41MV202 is in the north-central section of the Eagle Pass Mine permit
area on a level T1 surface between two paleochannels associated with Elm Creek
(Figure 24). Elm Creek, presently some 200 to 400 m to the east and 150 m south
of the site, cuts the southern edge of the landform on which the site is situated and
intersects both paleochannels there. The eastern paleochannel is deeply entrenched
and probably represents a relict channel of Elm Creek; ponded water covered a
narrow floodplain below the terrace escarpment at the time of testing (Figure 25).
The western paleochannel is shallower and may be a flood chute or tributary of
the relict creek. No water presently flows in this western channel. Site elevations
range from 772 ft on the terrace tread to 766 ft at the base of the southeastern slope.
Mining activities are projected to impact only the northern half of the site, and
testing focused on that area. However, limited work was done elsewhere to provide
an accurate characterization of the site extent and depth.
Vegetation on the terrace tread consists of scattered mesquite and acacia
trees with a dense to moderate understory of grasses, shrubs, prickly pears, and
other cacti. Dense grass and large trees follow the slopes of the paleochannels.
Ground surface visibility in the dense vegetation is limited (20 percent), but there
are eroded surface patches on the terrace tread where visibility is moderate to good
(50â70 percent). A two-track road runs north-south across the site on the western
edge of the terrace and also east-west across the southern third. Artifacts were
found eroding from these roads.
Previous Investigations
Site 41MV202 was initially recorded during a survey carried out by
Archeological Consultants, Inc. That work characterized it as a moderately dense
surface scatter of burned rocks, debitage, and tools. In 2012, the site was reevaluated
by TAS, Inc., with 40 shovel tests and 7 backhoe trenches excavated, as they looked
for buried cultural deposits and reassessed the geomorphology. Only 8 tests produced
artifacts; artifacts were found to a depth of 60 cm below the surface, although

encountered a midden deposit with much
fire-cracked rock, debitage, and mussel shell
extending from 10 to 50 cm below the surface.
This test was on the northeastern edge of the
site overlooking the eastern paleochannel
(Turner et al. 2015:59â60), and the eastern
edge or slope is where most artifacts were
seen eroding from the surface. Consequently,
backhoe trenches were placed in this area.
Trenching found artifacts at similar depths,
and shallowly buried midden deposits were
noted in two trenches near Shovel Test 190.
One trench (202-6a) defined an ashy lens with
four hearth-like concentrations of fire-cracked
rocks within it. Taken together, the shovel
tests, trenches, and surface evidence defined
a site area of 600 m north-south and 350 m
east-west. Diagnostic artifacts, found only
on the surface, included Ensor, Kinney, and
Shumla dart points indicating occupations
during the Middle to Late Archaic periods
(Turner et al. 2015:59â60).
Trenches were also used to make

small nodules. In the north part of the site
along the eastern paleochannel, the early to
middle Holocene alluvium was buried under a thin drape of late Holocene alluvium.
Late Holocene alluvium was also observed in one trench on the floodplain edge of the
eastern paleochannel. There, 30 cm of late Holocene alluvium was observed directly
atop bedrock with no evidence of cultural material within it (Turner et al. 2015:64â
65). Overall, the materials seen at 41MV202 were not considered to be unique, the
site was determined unlikely to contribute substantial information for understanding
south Texas prehistory, and no further work was recommended. Subsequent review
of that report by Prewitt and Associates, Inc., preparatory to submittal of it to the
Texas Historical Commission disagreed with this recommendation, arguing that
more work was needed to assess this very large site (Fields 2015).
Work Accomplished
Test excavations consisted of 34 backhoe trenches, 7 test units (1x1 m),
intensive surface scrutiny for diagnostic artifacts, and geomorphic reassessment.
This work was directed at determining if there are intact buried features and

62

associated middens. The previous investigations demonstrated that the terrace
and slopes above the eastern paleochannel would likely provide the best chance for
finding buried cultural materials, and the part of this area that will be impacted
by mining was the focus of these investigations with 24 trenches and 6 test units.
Limited work (2 trenches) was done to the west to confirm that cultural materials
are relatively sparse there. The remainder of the test excavations (8 trenches and
1 test unit) were placed on the southern part of the terrace to allow for possible
future expansion of mining impacts into this area.
The 34 trenches, oriented generally east-west, ranged in length from 6.3
to 17.1 m with an average of 8.9 m; they were 0.6 to 1.5 m deep. Cleaning and
recording of them showed that 19 (Trenches 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 12â15, 17, 19â22, 24â26,
28, and 30) had artifacts in their walls. Detailed soil descriptions were made for
17 (Trenches 1â5, 7, 8, 10, 12â14, and 16â21). All trenches were photographed, and
their locations were mapped.
The seven test units were placed off of seven trenches: Test Unit 1 on Trench
8, Test Unit 2 on Trench 22, Test Unit 3 on Trench 6, Test Unit 4 on Trench 10, Test
Unit 5 on Trench 30, Test Unit 6 on Trench 17, and Test Unit 7 on Trench 32. Test
units were located where artifacts were observed in the walls of the trenches and
where substantial materials were present on the surface. Test units were excavated
to the underlying bedrock or to where artifact counts significantly dropped; unit
depth ranged from 30 to 50 cm below the surface. In all, 3.1 m3 of sediment were
excavated and screened. Test Units 2, 4, and 5 placed off of Trenches 8, 10, and 30
produced substantial quantities of fire-cracked rocks and debitage from 10 to 40 cm
below the surface. The fire-cracked rocks in these units did not appear to be distinct
features but rather parts of a sheet midden. These three units and trenches were
at the northeastern terrace edge where the previous investigations had defined
an ashy fire-cracked rock midden. Ash was not observed in the units or trenches
excavated during the present investigations, however.
Two main areas of surface artifacts were noted. Fire-cracked rocks,
debitage, cores, chipped stone tools, and ground stone tools were found to be eroding
from these areas, although no disarticulated hearths were noted. Most of the tools
recovered from the surface came from the eastern central edge of the terrace
overlooking the relict channel of Elm Creek; this artifact scatter was designated
Area 1 (see Figure 24). Area 1 extends north to the vicinity of Trench 30 and Test
Unit 5, in which the possible fire-cracked rock midden was most pronounced. The
second surface scatter, designated Area 2, was on the southeastern lobe of the
terrace; it produced similar kinds of materials. These surface scatters reinforce
the evidence from the trenches that the site occupations were focused along the
eastern channel.
Site Sediments
Two constructional surfaces are present at 41MV202: the T1 terrace of Elm
Creek and the floodplain (T0) of a paleochannel, which is probably a relict course of
Elm Creek that forms the eastern boundary of the site (Figure 26). The T1 surface

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
stands about 4 m above the paleochannel and is separated from the floodplain by an
intervening erosional slope. The NCSS soils map does not distinguish between the
different geomorphic surfaces, as the entire site is mapped as Elindio association,
nearly level (Web Soil Survey 2017). Elindio soils are deep, well-drained, Aridic
Calciustolls formed in ancient calcareous alluvium (National Cooperative Soil

Figure 26. Generalized cross section of geomorphic surfaces and stratigraphy at 41MV202.

The soil stratigraphy below the T1 surface was described in nine backhoe
trenches, and eight trench profiles on the intervening T1âT0 slope interface were
described (see Appendix A). No trenches were placed on the floodplain (T0) of the
eastern paleochannel due to high water. However, three trenches were close to the
lower end of the T1âT0 slope interface. The observed deposits and soil imprints below
the T1 surface are similar to and consistent with observations made by Frederick
in 2012 (Turner et al. 2015). The T1 deposits consist of a thin (52â95 cm) mantle of
Holocene fine-grained overbank alluvium resting on weathered Cretaceous bedrock.
The Holocene alluvium typically exhibits an A-Bk soil profile (Figure 27a). The A
horizons are generally dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) to dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt
loam and silty clay loam. The Bk horizons are typically well-structured brown (10YR
5/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam
with common threads of calcium carbonate (stage I carbonate morphology). In a few
profiles (e.g., Trench 20), this soil is blanketed by 11â19 cm of brown (10YR 5/3) to
grayish brown (10YR 5/2) silt loam to silty clay loam representing recent, but local,
sheetwash and possibly eolian sediments.

(alternating laminations of sand and mud and gravel beds) over a buried A horizon on late Holocene alluvium
in Trench 16.

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
Based on the presence of a well-structured calcic B horizon below the T1
surface, Frederick suggested that the Holocene alluvial mantle was probably early
to middle Holocene in age. The interface between the early to middle Holocene
alluvium and the weathered bedrock is marked by a clear, though sometimes
gradual, boundary. The weathered bedrock is typically a well-structured 2Bk horizon
formed on light olive brown (2.5Y 5/3) silt loam and silty clay loam. Its common
calcium carbonate filaments and soft masses represent stage II secondary carbonate
morphology.
The soil stratigraphy observed in the profiles of the trenches on the T1âT0
slope interface does not differ much from that below the T1 surface. The main
difference is that the A horizon is buried by recent slope alluvium in four trenches
examined and completely removed in a fifth. The slope alluvium consists of pale
brown (10YR 6/3), brown (10YR 4/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or dark gray (10YR
4/1) silt loam to silty clay loam imprinted with an AC horizon. Less-weathered units
are designated as C horizons.
Deposits in three trenches on the lower slope of the T1âT0 interface at the
southern end of the site on the eastern paleochannel largely consist of minimally
altered packages of fine-grained alluvium, some with dispersed small gravels (about
1 percent) or thin gravel beds, that are laterally inset to the Cretaceous bedrock.
In places, some of these alluvial units are draped by recent slope alluvium that
mantles the T1âT0 slope interface (e.g., Trench 7). Many of these alluvial packages
display sedimentary structures such as alternating thin laminations of sand and
mud and thin gravel beds (Figure 27b). The preservation of these structures indicates
that many of these alluvial packages are recent in age. A cow bone found at 80 cm
below the surface in Trench 1 confirms the recent age of the deposits, or at least
the upper portion. In some trenches, however, the recent alluvial deposits overlie A
horizons that may be imprinted on late Holocene alluvium, such as the basal unit
(96â122+ cm) in Trench 1. Thus, while the upper deposits on the lower slope of the
T1âT0 interface are too recent to contain prehistoric materials, there are underlying
deposits that are of archeologically relevant age. No cultural materials were observed
in those lower deposits, however.
Site Extent and Depth
Based on these investigations, the site is larger than determined previously.
The greatest east-west extent is some 300 m from the eastern paleochannel to midslope above the western channel. The north-south site extent is approximately 1 km
extending from the southern terrace lobes north to where artifacts diminish. As
noted, most of the cultural materials were seen on the surface or in trenches near
the eastern paleochannel and on the southward-extending terrace lobes. Trenches
with cultural materials on the eastern terrace slopes are Trenches 10, 22, 23, 25,
28, 30, and 32. Positive trenches on the terrace tread are Trenches 6, 8, 14, and 24;
these occur widely, suggesting that cultural materials there are spotty. In contrast,
many trenches on the southern terrace lobes were positive: Trenches 2, 3, 17, 19, and
20. Trenches 1, 16, and 18 on the lower slopes of the southern terrace lobes did not
produce any cultural materials but rather displayed evidence of recent alluvium.

65

66

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
These trenches suggest that the southern extent of the site conforms more to the
landform than had been projected previously. Moving toward the western edge of the
terrace and the western paleochannel, cultural material becomes more ephemeral.
Here, Trenches 12 and 15 produced only a few fire-cracked rocks in their wall profiles,
and an unidentified dart point was recovered from the surface of the north-south
ranch road. Overall, artifacts in that road are few. The northern boundary of the site
is based on negative shovel test results from the previous investigations (Turner
et al. 2015:60). Trenches 13, 14, and 21 in that area produced only a few pieces of
fire-cracked rock and one flake.
Cultural materials observed in the trench walls, consisting of fire-cracked
rocks, debitage, and mussel shell fragments, were at depths of 0 to 50 cm below the
surface. The vertical extent of the site is best represented by the seven test units
placed on the terrace tread, the eastern slope, and the southern lobe of the terrace,
though (Table 7). They indicate that cultural materials are near the surface on the
terrace tread and shallowly buried on the slopes.

Notes: Test Unit 1, Level 3, also produced a Matamoros
dart point. Test Unit 2, Level 2, also produced a ground
stone axe fragment. Test Unit 4, Level 1, also produced
three cores. Test Unit 4, Level 2, also produced a bifacial
adze fragment.

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
Test Units 1 and 3 were on the terrace tread; both produced cultural materials
from 0 to 50 cm, with most materials above 30 cm. A Matamoros dart point was
recovered at 20â30 cm in Test Unit 1. Test Units 2, 4, and 5 were on the eastern
slope in the same general area as the possible midden defined by the previous
investigations. Cultural materials in these units extended from 0 to 50 cm below the
surface but were mainly above 30 cm. These units explored buried concentrations
of fire-cracked rocks and debitage noted in the walls of trenches. Test Unit 5 had
the greatest concentration of fire-cracked rocks and debitage (Figure 28). The
concentration appears to be a dump or sheet midden rather than distinct hearth
features. The depth of the concentration places it within the Holocene alluvium
above the Bk horizon and shallowly buried by recent slope alluvium (see Appendix
A, Trenches 4 and 10). Artifacts recovered below the concentrations into the Bk or
2Bk horizon likely reflect bioturbation, with extensive and active rodent burrowing
noted at the site.
A localized possible fire-cracked rock midden in the area surrounding Test
Units 2, 4, and 5 is strengthened by trenches with little or no cultural material
to the north, south, and west. In Test Unit 7 on Trench 32, just to the south, most
cultural material was recovered at 0â10 cm below the surface, which corresponds
to extensive material observed eroding from the surface in the vicinity of the trench
and unit. Farther south on the slopes of the terrace lobes, Test Unit 6 showed a
similar depth of deposits and kinds of materials as seen on the terrace tread and
the eastern slope, but fire-cracked rock and debitage frequencies were much lower
than in the concentrations in Test Units 2, 4, and 5.
Features
No cultural features were identified, although as noted above the
concentrations of fire-cracked rocks and debitage in Test Units 2, 4, and 5 may
mark a sheet midden on the eastern terrace slope at the north end of the site. This
possible midden may cover an area some 125 m north-south on the terrace edge above
the 771-ft contour. The three units produced 1,985 pieces of fire-cracked rock, 420
pieces of debitage, 1 Clear Fork tool, 1 ground axe fragment, 3 cores, 80 fragments
of Rabdotus sp. snail shell, and 10 fragments of mussel shell. Aside from the snail
and mussel shell fragments, midden materials such as animal bones, charcoal, and
other floral remains were not present or preserved, nor was there an ashy deposit
as reported by the previous investigators. Still, this possible midden may signal that
more-intensive food processing occurred here than at nearby sites were only small
concentrations of fire-cracked rocks may be interpreted as camp hearths. Associating
this midden with a particular period of occupation is problematic since no datable
materials were present, but the Clear Fork tool suggests a general association with
the Middle to Late Archaic periods.
Materials Recovered
A total of 2,333 fire-cracked rocks, 562 pieces of debitage, 3 cores, 1
Clear Fork tool, 1 Matamoros dart point, 1 ground axe fragment, 107 Rabdotus
sp. snail shell fragments, and 12 mussel shell fragments were recovered from

screening the fill of the seven test units (see Table 7). In addition, 3 cores, 1 Ensor
dart point, 1 Palmillas dart point, 2 Shumla dart points, 2 unidentified dart points,
1 Clear Fork tool, 1 Dimmitt tool, 1 hammerstone, 1 metate fragment, and 1 ceramic
sherd were recovered from surface contexts.
The snail and mussel shells are almost all fragmentary. The snail shell is
identified as Rabdotus sp. based on the few whole shells and shell spires. Most of
the mussel shells are unidentifiable as to species. However. one fragment, from Test
Unit 5 at 10â20 cm below the surface, is complete enough to be identified as the
right valve of a Quadrula sp. mussel. Quadrula sp. is common to south Texas river
systems and can be found in a variety of substrates including mud, gravel, and sand
(Howells et al. 1996:105â107).
Almost half of the fire-cracked rocks and debitage from the test units are
from Test Unit 5, which sampled the possible fire-cracked rock midden. The firecracked rocks from all the test units are mostly small fragments less than or equal
to 5 cm in diameter and do not exceed 10 cm in diameter. These cobble fragments
are limestone, sandstone, and chert. The source of this material is likely nearby
Uvalde Gravel eroding from the uplands or carried near the site area by Elm Creek.
Debitage
The 462 pieces of debitage recovered consist 202 flakes, 177 chips, and
83 chunks. Just over half of the debitage displays cortex (n = 239, 52 percent) or
was heated (n = 247, 53 percent). These numbers suggest that both primary and
secondary material reduction took place at the site. The material of choice for
tool production was Edwards chert (n = 286, 62 percent), but other materials are
also represented: other chert (n = 40), igneous rock (n = 54), quartzite (n = 69),
petrified wood (n = 12), and sandstone (n = 1). Edwards chert exhibits colors
of white, cream, tan, brown, light gray, gray, or a combination of these. Heated
Edwards chert is often purple-gray or pink. Other materials display more gray to
dark gray and black colors.
Cores
Of the six cores, two came from the south wall of Trench 14 at 10 cm below
the surface, three came from Test Unit 4 at 0â10 cm below the surface, and one
came from the east-central surface scatter (Area 1). All are identified as Edwards
chert based on their fluorescence under ultraviolet black light. Five are partial
cobble/pebble cores with multidirectional flake removals and no deliberate platform
preparation. As a group, they represent a gradation in reduction or flaking intensity.
All exhibit some exterior cortex, but they have been reduced enough that the initial
size of the raw material cannot be estimated. Natural weathered and stream-worn
cortex exteriors and previous flake removal scars served as striking platforms. Flake
removal directions appear to be randomly oriented. In some cases, it appears that a
portion or end of the cobble or pebble was removed by percussion to create an initial
single-faceted striking platform. The sixth specimen is a discoidal core recovered
from the wall of Trench 14; it has percussion flake removals from both the upper
and lower surfaces in a radial pattern.

Projectile Points
Six of the seven dart points came from surface contexts. The seventh, a
Matamoros point, was recovered from Test Unit 1 at a depth of 28 cm. An Ensor
point was found in the east-central surface scatter (Area 1). It is fashioned from
tan Edwards chert that is not heat treated (Figure 29a). It has a side-notched stem,
which is characteristic of the region extending from the lower Pecos River to San
Antonio (Turner et al. 2011:94). Beyond San Antonio, they occur mixed with the
corner-notched form characteristic of the region between the Brazos and Colorado
Rivers. The point is complete but exhausted, as its blade is heavily resharpened.
Its basal stem edge is straight. Ensor is a Late Archaic style across all of central
and southwest Texas (Collins 2004:113; Hester 2004:140; Turner et al. 2011:94).

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
The Matamoros point (Figure 29b) is triangular with rounded basal corners.
It is fashioned from heat-treated pinkish-tan Edwards chert. Its blade edges are
straight, and its basal edge is slightly convex. The chronology of Matamoros points is
problematic, but they appear to date between the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
periods across southern and southwest Texas (Turner et al. 2011:135).
A Palmillas point was collected from Area 1 (Figure 29c). The point was
manufactured of cream-colored Edwards chert with light tan to brown speckles and
does not appear to be heat treated. The stem is slightly expanding with a convex
basal edge. The reworked blade has convex edges and a distal impact fracture. Turner
et al. (2011:145) place this style in the Middle to Late Archaic periods.
Two Shumla dart points were recovered from Areas 1 and 2; both are
manufactured of heat-treated tan to brown Edwards chert. Stems are corner notched
and expanding with convex basal edges. Barbs are missing or reworked on both
points. The blade on one specimen is heavily resharpened bifacially along both edges
but exhibits only a slight bevel (Figure 29d). The other point has a transverse fracture
across the blade (Figure 29e). Shumla points are a Late Archaic style common across
much of the Trans Pecos and south Texas (Hester 2004:140; Turner et al. 2011:162).
Two dart points are untyped. One from Area 1 is brown and gray Edwards
chert (Figure 29f), The second, from the southwest edge of the site, is non-Edwards
fine-grained gray-brown chert with chalcedony veinlets throughout that represent
filled internal fractures (Figure 29g). The source for this chert is unknown but may
be some of the Pennsylvanian cherts that occur near the Marble Falls region. Neither
is heat treated. Both are stemmed, but the blade edges are heavily resharpened, and
the stems appear to have been modified or repaired making identification with an
established type unfeasible. Both are assumed to be Middle to Late Archaic based
on general stem morphologies.
Clear Fork and Dimmitt Tools
Among the formal tools are three distally beveled triangular bifaces and
unifaces that likely represent specialized hafted woodworking implements called
Clear Fork and Dimmitt tools. There is no apparent functional difference between
the unifacial and bifacial examples; the distinctions may reflect techniques of
manufacture or resharpening and maintenance. One Clear Fork tool was recovered
from Test Unit 4 within the possible fire-cracked rock midden, and the other tools
came from surface contexts. Two are manufactured of Edwards chert, and one is
gray rhyolite or some other type of igneous extrusive like basalt or andesite. Each
implement was manufactured from a thick percussion flake by direct percussion;
in each case, the bulb of percussion and striking platform have been trimmed away.
Such tool forms have been reported by Hall et al. (1986) from their work at Choke
Canyon Reservoir in south Texas, and Dockall (1998:172) reports a similar suite of
tools for a series of 11 sites along Sacatosa Creek near Laughlin Air Force Base in
Val Verde County.
The Clear Fork tool from Test Unit 4 is a distal fragment from a biface
broken in a transverse bending fracture during use (Figure 29h). The other Clear

71

72

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
Fork tool, recovered from the surface between Trenches 22 and 34, is complete and
has the characteristic elongated shape and distal bevel (Figure 29i). Both have
bifacial impact damage on the distal beveled edges from use against a resistant
hard material such as wood. These artifacts are morphologically similar to Group
1 and Group 2 beveled bifaces and unifaces from Choke Canyon Reservoir (Hall et
al. 1986:320). Clear Fork tools are considered to be associated with the Middle to
Late Archaic periods (Turner et al. 2011).
The Dimmitt tool, recovered from the surface on the west-central edge
of the site, has an over-thickened cross section with the greatest thickness just
behind the bevel and has a pointed to slightly rounded proximal end (Figure 29j).
The bit edge is not battered or otherwise damaged from impact against resistant
materials. Rather, the edges have been carefully retouched by unifacial soft-hammer
percussion and are very slightly convex. Edge wear includes slight rounding and
occasional microscars with feather-and-step terminations onto the dorsal aspect
and development of a matte to medium polish on the ventral aspect of the edge.
This type of wear is commonly associated with scraping tasks, particularly on softer
materials like soft wood and plant materials. Hester (2004:139, Figure 4.14) describes
a similar type of bifacial or unifacial tool (see also Nunley and Hester 1966; Tomka
2002:83â84) and notes that these tools typically have quite a bit of resharpening on
them and are distributed across an area along the Rio Grande from Eagle Pass to
Falcon Reservoir and into adjacent regions. Tomka (2002:83) notes that these tools
have a hump-backed appearance. The one recovered from 41MV202 is similar in
form to Group 3, Forms 1 and 2, from sites at Choke Canyon Reservoir (Hall et al.
1986:326â328). Hester et al. (1969:152) note that Dimmitt implements occur across
a region of southwest Texas inclusive of Dimmitt, Maverick, Starr, Webb, and Zapata
Counties. Dimmitt tools are considered to be associated with the Middle Archaic
period (Hester 2004:149).
Ground Stone Tools
Three ground stone artifacts were recovered. One is a small jasper pebble
hammerstone recovered from the southern surface scatter (Area 2); it has two pitted
and battered surfaces. The second is a sandstone metate fragment recovered from
the east-central surface scatter (Area 1). It has one well-smoothed and slightly
concave surface and possible shaping along a remnant edge. The third is a fragment
of a ground stone celt or axe (Figure 30a). This specimen is a basalt bit fragment
or flake from a bit, recovered from Test Unit 2 within the possible fire-cracked rock
midden. The polished and ground surface has striations from the grinding and
polishing process and retains a small area of the bit edge that would indicate that
it was removed during impact and represents a use break. The polished and ground
surfaces of this artifact are easily distinguished from stream-worn or otherwise
weathered surfaces. Although the origin of this item is not known, grooved ground
stone axes and celts are known from northern and eastern Mexico, particularly
Chihuahua and Coahuila. Also, Mitchell (1975) reports on ground stone celt or celtlike objects from LaSalle and Cameron Counties and three-quarter-grooved axes
from Nueces and Dimmitt Counties.

Ceramic Vessel Sherd
One other surface find in the east-central surface scatter (Area 1) a ceramic
vessel body sherd (Figure 30b). It was recovered adjacent to Trench 23 on the eastern
slope of the terrace. No burned rocks, debitage, or mussel shells were noted in the
walls of this trench, and only one piece of burned rock was spotted in the trench
backdirt. This recovery contrasts with Trench 30 and Test Unit 5 approximately
30 m to the north, which produced much fire-cracked rock and debitage but no
ceramic sherds.
The sherd is 35.56 mm long and ranges from 8.18 to 10.32 mm in thickness.
Interior and exterior color is reddish brown (5YR 5/4) while the core color is brown
(7.5YR 5/3). The exterior surface is smoothed with an eroded spot, and the interior
surface is burnished. Given the interior burnishing, its likely that this sherd came
from a simple open bowl that allowed ease of access to apply this finishing technique.
The sherd has a sandy paste or is sand tempered, although there also appear to be
fragments of finely pulverized bone in the paste. Bone tempering suggests that the
sherd may be associated with Late Prehistoric Toyah phase ceramic wares. These
wares, such as that typed as Leon Plain, occur in central Texas, but are also known
from sites on the Rio Grande Plain (Black 1986; Hester 2004; Mehalchick et al.
1999). There is also a possibility that this sherd is associated with Lower Pecos
region Infierno phase pottery, although ceramics from this phase are not well defined
(Turpin and Robinson 1998).
Summary and Assessment
Site 41MV202 is on a T1 terrace and the T1âT0 slope interface between two
paleochannels, with the eastern one likely being a relict channel of Elm Creek. The
archeological materials are concentrated near this relict channel and represent
prehistoric open campsites occupied at various times during the Archaic and Late
Prehistoric periods. The testing included 32 backhoe trenches and 7 test units.
Cultural materials, including a possible fire-cracked rock midden, were found mainly

73

74

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
in the upper 30â40 cm of a middle to late Holocene alluvial mantle over weathered
bedrock. In some areas along the eastern terrace edge, the Holocene alluvium is
buried by a shallow deposit of recent alluvium. Artifacts eroding at the surface
were found to be concentrated along the eastern terrace edge. Ensor, Palmillas, and
Shumla projectile points and a ceramic sherd were recovered from this surface, and
scattered debitage and fire-cracked rocks were noted as well. These points and the
sherd indicate occupations during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, and
a Middle Archaic component is indicated by a Kinney point found during previous
investigations.
Trenching did not reveal any discrete cultural features, however, a possible
midden composed of fire-cracked rocks and debitage was encountered in Trenches
10, 22, and 30 and explored in Test Units 2, 4, and 5. These excavations covered a
swath of the terrace edge approximately 125 m long, which may approximate the
size of the midden deposit. Datable materials were not recovered from this midden.
However, a Clear Fork tool from Test Unit 2 suggests it may be associated with
Middle or Late Archaic period occupations. The presence of this midden suggests
that more-intensive food processing occurred at 41MV202 than at nearby sites
where midden deposits were not found.
The cultural materials recovered from the test units consist of 2,333 firecracked rocks, 562 pieces of debitage, 1 Matamoros dart point, 1 bifacial adze
fragment, 3 cores, 1 ground stone axe fragment, 107 snail shell fragments, and
12 mussel shell fragments. This equates to a comparatively high artifact density,
undoubtedly related to the presence of the midden deposit. Although artifacts
are relatively abundant, the thinness of the cultural deposit and the fact that it
represents multiple repeated occupations over a long span of time indicate that it
would be impossible to isolate components and interpret them. Further, no materials
suitable for radiocarbon dating were found, preventing firm determination of the ages
of the occupations, and the lack of floral and faunal data means there is no evidence
concerning Native American subsistence practices. Because of these limitations, the
site lacks the ability to contribute important information and is considered ineligible
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
41MV319
Site Setting
Site 41MV319 is at the north-central edge of the Eagle Pass Mine permit
area on a T1 surface adjacent to the present channel of Elm Creek. The creek forms
the western boundary of the site, and a tertiary channel, likely a flood chute, forms
the eastern boundary (Figure 31). The eastern channel intersects an east-west
tributary of Elm Creek, which forms the siteâs southern boundary. Elevations range
from 786 ft at the north end of the T1 surface to 776 ft at south end. The western
third of the site, along Elm Creek, is within the Elm Creek Protection Plan buffer
zone and thus is protected from disturbance by mining activities. Active mining will
impact only the eastern part of the site, and this is where site testing took place.
However, all of the terrace between the creek and the eastern channel was inspected

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
visually to provide an accurate characterization of the site extent. This inspection
found that the western part of the site along Elm Creek is extensively eroded with
several large gullies impacting the terrace slopes. Much cultural material is eroding
from these gullies into the creek.
Vegetation on the terrace tread consists of scattered mesquite and acacia
trees with a dense to moderate understory of grasses, shrubs, prickly pears, and
other cacti. Dense grasses and large trees grow along Elm Creek and the eastern
channel. Ground surface visibility in the dense vegetation is limited (20 percent), but
there are eroded surface patches on the terrace tread where visibility is moderate to
good (50â70 percent). Ranch roads and denuded areas around feeding stations and
hunting stands also provide good surface visibility. Roads runs east-west across Elm
Creek at the northern end of the site, and two others run east-west and northeastsouthwest across the site to access deer feeders and a hunting stand. Artifacts were
found eroding from these roads, at feeding stations and the hunting stand, and from
the gullies along Elm Creek.
Previous Investigations
Site 41MV319 had some intensive survey and test investigations prior
to the work reported here. Survey investigations in 2009 placed 205 shovel
tests across the site and opened 2 backhoe trenches near Elm Creek (Turpin et
al. 2010:51â55). Only 1 shovel test produced subsurface artifacts, to a depth of
30 cm. However, Trench 6 on the west-central terrace edge overlooking Elm Creek
encountered two possible cultural zones within Holocene alluvium at 20â27 and
40â45 cm below the surface (Turpin et al. 2010:52). These zones were marked by
fire-cracked rocks and debitage. Still, most of the features and artifacts identified
during this survey were at or near the surface. The features identified consisted
of 27 burned rock concentrations suggestive of middens and hearths and 2 shell
middens of Tampico pearly mussels (Crytonaias tampicoensis). Tools recovered
included ground stone fragments (number unspecified), 20 bifaces, uniface
scrapers (number unspecifed), and 18 projectile points. The projectile points
include a Caracara arrow point, an unspecified number of untyped arrow points,
a possible late Paleoindian stemmed dart point, an Abasolo dart point, 2 Baker/
Uvalde dart points, a Bulverde dart point, a Catan dart point, a Desmuke dart
point, an Early Triangular dart point, an Ensor dart point, 2 Frio dart points, a
Marcos dart point, a Martindale point, and 2 Refugio dart points. Most of these
features and tools were found in the western and southwestern parts of the site
overlooking Elm Creek and its tributary. The array of projectile points led the
investigators to conclude that the site had components that ranged in age from
the Early Archaic period to the Late Prehistoric period.
In 2010, the site underwent testing that consisted of six backhoe trenches
and two 1x1-m test units focused on the western edge of the site (Turpin et al.
2011:29â37). Four possible hearths were identified in the 1x1-m units placed off
the north and south walls of Trench 9T4. Features 1, 2, and 4 were in Unit A and
were small (30â50 cm) concentrations of fire-cracked rocks defined in Levels 3, 6,
and 10 respectively. Feature 3 in Levels 6 and 7 of Unit B was somewhat different

in that it appeared to have a pit associated with fire-cracked rocks. No temporally
diagnostic artifacts were associated with any of these features. However, a charcoal
sample from Feature 3 produced a calibrated two-sigma radiocarbon date range of
390â170 b.c., and a sample from Feature 4 produced two-sigma ranges of 1380â
1330 and 1330â1120 b.c. (Turpin et al. 2011:19). These dates strongly support
a Late Archaic component for the site and suggest that some 40 cm of alluvium
was deposited over a period of about 1,000 years near the creek edge. In addition,
macrobotanical analysis of a sample from Feature 4 demonstrated that mesquite,
acacia, and snakewood was burned, but no remains indicative of plant food processing
were found in the feature (Puseman and Cummings 2011:101).
Work Accomplished
Test excavations consisted of 18 backhoe trenches, 4 test units (1x1 m),
intensive surface scrutiny for diagnostic artifacts, and geomorphic reassessment
of the site. This work was directed at the eastern third of the site, which will be
impacted by mining. The work was carried out to determine if there are intact buried
features in the eastern part of the site as had been encountered by previous test
excavations along the active channel of Elm Creek to the west.
The 18 trenches, oriented generally east-west, ranged in length from 6.3 to
8.5 m, with an average of 7.5 m, and were 0.9 to 1.3 m deep. They were placed on the
terrace tread on both sides of a shallow gully that cuts north to south through the
center of the eastern third of the site. Cleaning and recording of these 18 trenches
showed that half (Trenches 2â5, 10, 11, and 15â17) had debitage or fire-cracked
rocks in their walls. These artifacts were single occurrences or small concentrations
ranging from 10 to 80 cm below the surface. Detailed soil descriptions were made
for 12 of the trenches both with and without artifacts (Trenches 1â6, 8, 10, 11, and
14â16). All trenches were photographed, and their locations were mapped.
The four test units were placed off of four trenches: Test Unit 1 at Trench
2, Test Unit 2 at Trench 5, Test Unit 3 at Trench 10, and Test Unit 4 at Trench 17.
Units where positioned where artifacts, especially concentrations, were observed
in the walls of the trenches and were excavated to the bedrock or a depth where
artifact counts significantly dropped, ranging from 70 to 100 cm below the surface.
In all, 3.1 m3 of sediment were excavated and screened. Test Units 1 and 4 produced
substantial quantities of fire-cracked rocks and debitage, while Test Units 2 and 3
had light to moderate amounts of material throughout.
A surface inspection of the entire site was conducted as well. Fire-cracked
rocks, debitage, and some chipped and ground stone tools were observed eroding
from ranch roads, feeder locations, and cattle tracks along the terrace tread and
from gullies cutting the western terrace slope to Elm Creek, and five surface artifact
concentrations were defined (see Figure 31). Gullying along the western edge of the
site is extensive and is a major impact to site integrity in that area. Most of the
tools observed, which included 14 temporally diagnostic projectile points, came from
these western gullies. No hearths were noted on the surface, but two large scatters
of mussel shell fragments were noted near the center of the site.

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
Site Sediments
The T1 surface on which 41MV319 is situated stands about 5â6 m above the
Elm Creek channel. The surface is mapped as gently undulating Copita association
soils, with soils of the Elindio association, nearly level, mapped along the margins of
the landform (Web Soil Survey 2017). Copita soils are well-drained, moderately deep
Aridic Calciustepts formed in calcareous loamy residuum derived from sandstone
(National Cooperative Soil Survey 2017c). Elindio soils are deep, well-drained,
Aridic Calciustolls formed in ancient calcareous alluvium (National Cooperative
Soil Survey 2017b).
The soil stratigraphy below the T1 surface was described in 12 trenches
(see Appendix A). The observed deposits and soil imprints below the surface are
similar from trench to trench, exhibiting pedogenically altered fine-grained Holocene
alluvium. The alluvium is thin (74â95 cm) and rests on either older alluvium (late
Pleistocene?) or weathered Cretaceous bedrock. The boundary with the underlying
older alluvium is typically clear, whereas the boundary with the bedrock is abrupt.
The Holocene alluvium exhibits A-Bk and A-Bw soil profiles (Figure 32). The A
horizons generally consist of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silt loam. The Bw and
Bk horizons are typically well-structured grayish brown (10YR 5/2) to brown (10YR
5/3) silty clay loam to silt loam with the Bk horizons containing a few threads of
calcium carbonate (stage I carbonate Figure
morphology).

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
In 2009, Frederick (Turpin et al. 2010) observed the sediments and
stratigraphy below the T1 surface at 41MV319, but only in one trench. He assigned
a middle to late Holocene age to the alluvial mantle, an age that seems consistent
with the degree of soil formation (the presence of cambic horizons and weakly
developed calcic horizons with a filamentous morphology) observed during the
current investigations. Frederick, however, was unsure about the nature of the
underlying deposits, noting that they could be a late Pleistocene alluvium or altered
bedrock. On the opposite side of Elm Creek, he observed late Pleistocene alluvium
buried below a thin (50 cm) mantle of Holocene alluvium on the T1 terrace and deeply
buried (360 cm below the surface) along the channel margin of the terrace. Based on
the current investigations, it appears that late Pleistocene alluvium is present below
the T1 surface on the east side of Elm Creek as well, although at times it is difficult
to distinguish between it and weathered bedrock below the middle to late Holocene
alluvial mantle. Both the late Pleistocene alluvium and the weathered Cretaceous
bedrock observed in the trenches at 41MV319 are similar in color, typically light
olive brown (2.5Y 5/3), but the color variation is greater for the alluvium, sometimes
ranging into 10YR hues. The main distinguishing characteristics between the two
are the amount of secondary carbonate and the presence of secondary gypsum. While
both exhibit stage II carbonate morphology, the weathered bedrock has much more
carbonate in the form of common nodules and soft masses than the late Pleistocene
alluvium, which generally contains only common threads and few nodules. In
addition, the weathered bedrock contains various amounts of secondary gypsum,
whereas the alluvium contains none.
Bedrock was observed below the middle to late Holocene alluvial mantle
in only three trenches (two of which, Trenches 11 and 16, are described in detail),
all on the east side of the site near the tertiary channel (Figure 33). In all three
trenches, the bedrock surface dips eastward toward that channel. This suggests
that the channel removed the late Pleistocene alluvium that previously mantled the
bedrock core of the terrace from along its margins, or that the Pleistocene alluvium
thins away (eastward) from Elm Creek (as it does on the west side of the creek),
which would indicate that this segment of Elm Creek has occupied the same course
since late Pleistocene times.

Regardless, it is the middle to late Holocene alluvial deposit blanketing
the T1 surface that hosts cultural materials at 41MV319. The many artifacts that
litter the surface, particularly along the eroded western margins of the T1 surface,
probably give an unrealistic impression of the subsurface artifact density given the
recovery from hand excavations during the current and previous investigations.
Site Extent and Depth
The horizontal extent of 41MV319 was not substantially altered by these
investigations. Previous work indicated that the site extends some 550 m north-south
by 325 m east-west at the north end of the site and 200 m eastâwest at the south
end. These dimensions take into account the extent of the landform between Elm
Creek and its tributary channels. The northern boundary is arbitrary, as the site
stops at the ranch road that marks the mine permit boundary. Surface inspection
indicates that the site extends north of this east-west road at least to the property
line fence that parallels the road.
Figure 34
Five areas of artifacts exposed
at the surface or eroding from the
terrace slopes were identified during
the surface inspection. Artifacts
in these areas include fire-cracked
rocks, debitage, and both ground and
chipped stone tools. The majority
of the projectile points and other
stone tools found were in the three
areas (2, 4, and 5) that surround the
gullies cutting the western edge of the
terrace overlooking Elm Creek (Figure
34). The quantity of artifacts in
these gullies, along with the features
identified near them in the previous
investigations, suggest that that
the western portion was the main
focus for site occupations. However,
the trenches dug during this project
indicate that the high spots on the
terrace tread also saw prehistoric
occupations. Trenches on these high
spots include Trenches 1â5 on the
northwest edge of the tested area,
Trenches 15 and 16 on the northeast
side, and Trenches 10 and 11 on the
southeast side.

on the terrace tread (Table 8). They indicate that cultural materials are present
throughout the Holocene alluvium mantling the Pleistocene alluvium or Cretaceous
bedrock, occurring to depths of 70â100 cm. Materials are densest by far and
deepest in Test Unit 1 in the northwest part of the tested area. Burned rocks and
debitage combined show upper and lower high-density peaks at about 30â60 and
70â90 cm. Test Unit 4 to the northeast had the second-highest frequency of artifacts,
concentrated at 30â50 cm. Test Units 2 and 3 in the central and southern parts
of the tested area had fewer artifacts, mostly in the upper 30â40 cm. Snail shells
were found in all units and mussel shells in two, but it is not certain that they are
of cultural origin.
No materials datable by radiocarbon were recovered, and only two temporally
diagnostic artifacts were found. A Dimmitt tool, from 40â50 cm in Test Unit 4, is
thought to date to the Middle Archaic period. It could indicate that the deeper
cultural zone in Test Unit 1 marks an older component possibly associated with the
Early Archaic period, although extrapolation between these units spaced about 100 m
apart is risky. The other diagnostic is a Scallorn arrow point from the uppermost
level of Test Unit 2; it reflects occupation during the Late Prehistoric period.
The cultural zones in the test units are at similar depths below the surface
as zones and features identified during previous investigations at the site. Two
zones of fire-cracked rocks and debitage were identified during the 2009 survey at
20â30 and 40â50 cm in Trench 6 at the west-central edge of the site. Also of similar

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
depth are the fireâcracked rock features identified at the northwest end of the site
along Elm Creek during the 2010 testing (Turpin et al. 2011:19): Feature 3 was at
60â70 cm, and Feature 4 was at 90â110 cm. They produced Late Archaic radiocarbon
dates. These dates suggest that cultural deposits on the west side of the site could
be younger than materials buried at comparable depths on the east side, but this
is only speculation given the paucity of temporal data.
Features
All four test units (particularly Test Unit 1) and some of the trenches
exposed scattered burned rocks, but none were sufficiently concentrated to be
defined as distinct cultural features. As many as 48 thermal features were reported
on the surface by the original surveyors (Turpin et al. 2010:51), but no hearths or
middens were noted during these investigations. This difference is likely the result
of continued degradation of the site surface due to erosion by livestock traffic.
However, two mussel shell concentrations were observed, and these may be the
ones reported by the original survey (Turpin et al. 2010:51). These concentrations
are near the center and south-central parts of the site, with Trenches 5 and 7 being
the closest excavations. The concentrations are 3 to 5 m in diameter, and the shell
is highly fragmentary.
Seven relatively complete umbos were collected for identification from the
concentration near Trench 5. Five of these shells could be identified as Tampico
Pearly Mussels (Cyrtonaias tampicoensis) (Howells et al. 1996:48â50). These
mussels have a wide range in south Texas and are present in slow-flowing streams
with mud bottoms. Two umbos were identified as Yellow Sand Shells (Lampsilis
teres) (Howells et al. 1996:69â71). This species also has a wide range across Texas,
as they are found both in large and small streams and rivers and can survive in
turbid water conditions with either a rock or mud substrate. Both species would
not be out of place in an environment provided by Elm Creek.
The mussel shell features could be associated with a Late Prehistoric site
component. Test Unit 2, near the northern shell feature, yielded a Scallorn arrow
point, and another Scallorn was found on the surface near Trench 4 north of there.
The proximity of these points both vertically and horizontally to the mussel shell
features may suggest that Late Prehistoric period activity at the site included mussel
harvesting from Elm Creek.
Materials Recovered
A total of 1,110 fire-cracked rocks, 303 pieces of debitage, 3 cores, 1 Dimmitt
tool, 1 Scallorn arrow point, 76 Rabdotus sp. snail shell fragments, and 5 mussel
shell fragments were recovered from screening the fill of the four test units (see
Table 8). The snail and mussel shells are highly fragmented, and none of the mussel
shells could be identified. The majority of the fire-cracked rocks and debitage came
from Test Unit 1 which had a concentration of materials in Levels 8 and 9 that may
represent a sheet midden. The fire-cracked rocks from all the test units consist of
mostly small fragments less than or equal to 5 cm in diameter and not exceeding

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
10 cm. These cobble fragments were identified in the field as limestone, sandstone,
and chert. The source of this material is likely nearby Uvalde Gravels eroding from
the upland or carried near the site area by Elm Creek. Surface finds or finds from
the trenches consist of 1 arrow point, 16 dart points, 3 bifacial tools, 1 unifacial tool,
and 1 Dimmitt tool.
Debitage
The 303 pieces of debitage consist of 168 flakes with striking platform, 102
chips, and 33 chunks. Half has dorsal cortex (n = 151, 50 percent), and just more
than half has been heated or burned (n = 168, 55 percent). Most of the debitage is
Edwards chert (n = 211, 70 percent). Other chert (n = 45), that is chert that does
not fluoresce under ultraviolet black light, makes up 15 percent, while igneous
rock (n = 26, 9 percent), quartzite (n = 15, 5 percent), and petrified wood (n = 4, 1
percent) constitute the remainder of the sample. The major colors associated with
Edwards material are light gray, gray, and brown; other cherts are gray and dark
gray. Clearly, there was a preference for chert as a raw material in the manufacture
of chipped stone tools.
Cores
The three cores, all from Test Unit 1, are identified as Edwards chert based
on their fluorescence. One is a partial cobble/pebble core, one is a macroflake core,
and one is a burned core fragment. The partial cobble/pebble core is a general
percussion core with multidirectional flake removals and no deliberate platform
preparation. It has some exterior cortex but is reduced enough that the initial size
of the raw material cannot be estimated. Natural weathered and stream-worn
cortex exteriors and previous flake removal scars served as striking platforms.
Flake removal directions appear to be randomly oriented. The macroflake core is a
proximal end of a larger percussion flake that has been reduced to a smaller core
size by hard-hammer percussion. Whether this piece was trimmed to size and shape
deliberately or represents an exhausted core cannot be determined. The burned core
fragment probably represents a piece of a cortex-free core.
Projectile Points
The two arrow points are both identified as Scallorns. One came from surface
scatter Area 3 (Figure 35a), and the other came from Test Unit 2, Level 1 (Figure
35b). Both are of Edwards chert. They are complete except for their tip portions that
are broken in transverse bending fractures. A lateral edge of one point is serrated.
Raw materials appear to have been heat treated prior to manufacture. Scallorn
points are associated with the early Late Prehistoric period in central and south
Texas (Collins 2004:113; Hester 2004).
A total of 16 dart points were recovered from the surface: 5 Ensor (Areas 1, 2,
and 4), 2 Fairland (Area 5), 3 Frio (Area 2), 1 Lange (Area 5), 2 Marcos (Areas 2 and
5), 1 Marshall (Area 5), and 2 unidentified (Area 3). No dart points were recovered
from test units or trenches. The span of time they represent extends from the Middle

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
Archaic to Late Archaic periods (Collins 2004; Hester 2004; Turner et al. 2011). All
of these styles are common in the central and south Texas regions.
Four of the Ensors (Figure 35câg) are of Edwards chert, and 1 of reddish
jasper. Two of the Edwards chert specimens are heat treated. Chert colors include
off-white or cream, tan, and gray or mottled examples of these colors. These points
have side-notched stems which are characteristic of a region extending from the
lower Pecos River to San Antonio (Turner et al. 2011:94). Beyond San Antonio,
they occur mixed with the corner-notched form characteristic of the region between
the Brazos and Colorado Rivers. Four are complete, and one is a proximal-medial
fragment. Two complete points are exhausted; the blades are heavily resharpened,
and one is alternately beveled (see Figure 35g). Basal stem edges include straight,
concave, and convex examples. The Ensor dart point type is a Late Archaic style
across all of central and southwest Texas (Collins 2004:113; Hester 2004:140; Turner
et al. 2011:94).
Both Fairland points are of Edwards chert. One specimen is cream colored
(Figure 35h), and the other is a heat-treated banded gray and white chert (Figure
35i). Stems are corner notched and expanding with concave basal edges and flaring
stem edges. Tips of both points are missing due to impact fractures. Blades of both
are planoconvex to subtriangular in cross section. Fairland is a Late Archaic style
across all of central and southwest Texas (Collins 2004:113; Hester 2004:140; Turner
et al. 2011:99).
All three Frio points (Figure 35jâl) are of heat-treated Edwards chert. Colors
include gray mottled and off-white or cream. Stems are side notched. All stem basal
edges are concave with flaring ears. Two have been resharpened, and two have distal
impact fractures. Frio is a Late Archaic style across all of central and southwest
Texas (Collins 2004:113; Hester 2004:140; Turner et al. 2011:106).
The Lange point (Figure 35m) was manufactured from brown-gray Edwards
chert; it has an expanding stem and one prominent shoulder. The stem has a convex
basal edge. One entire side of the point has been reworked or repaired by percussion
retouch, which gives it a convex edge above the stem. The opposing intact blade
edge is straight. The distal part of the blade is broken in a bending fracture. Turner
et al. (2011:127), Collins (2004), and Hester (2004) associate Lange points with the
Late Archaic period in central and south Texas.
The two Marcos points (Figure 35nâo) are of yellow-tan to gray-brown
heat-treated Edwards chert. Stems are corner notched and expanding and have
slightly convex basal edges. Blade edges on one are straight and well finished by
pressure flaking (Figure 35n), and the blade edges on the other (Figure 35o) have
been considerably reworked by pressure and percussion retouch. Each point has
a shoulder or barb missing. This point style is a Late Archaic form common across
central and south Texas (Hester 2004; Collins 2004:113; Turner et al. 2011:130) and
is similar in morphology and range to Castroville and Montell.
A fragmentary dart point provisionally identified as Marshall was
manufactured from grayish brown Edwards chert with no apparent heat treatment

85

86

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
(Figure 35p). The stem is complete, but the blade had been broken by a radiating
postdepositional fracture based on patination differences between the fracture face
and the blade surface. The stem is corner notched and expanding with a slightly
convex basal edge. Both barbs are missing. Marshall dart points have been associated
with the late Middle Archaic period (Turner et al. 2011:131) and the middle Late
Archaic period (Collins 2004:113).
Two dart points are untyped (Figure 35qâr). One is brown, and the other
is gray Edwards chert. Neither is heat treated. Both are stemmed or shouldered,
but the blade edges are heavily resharpened, and the stems appear to have been
modified or repaired making identification with established types unfeasible. Both
are assumed to be Middle to Late Archaic based on general stem morphologies.
Bifaces
Three bifaces were recovered from surface contexts. Two are bifacial knives
from Areas 2 and 5 (Figure 36aâb). Each is made of mottled Edwards chert that
has not been heat treated. One is complete, and one is an end fragment with a
transverse break. The complete knife has a convex proximal end, and the lateral
edges on both are convex. Neither exhibits distal impact fractures to suggest they
functioned as projectile points. Each has been resharpened and has edge rounding,
smoothing, and small bifacial microscars from use. The third item in this group is a
small triangular Stage 3 biface from Area 1; it is burned Edwards chert (Figure 36c).
Dimmitt Tools
Two small distally beveled triangular bifaces likely represent specialized
hafted woodworking implements (Figure 36dâe). One came from the backdirt
of Trench 17, and the other is Test Unit 4 placed off of Trench 17. Both are
manufactured by direct percussion on thick percussion flakes of Edwards chert; in
each case, the bulb of percussion and striking platform have been trimmed away. A
small area of dorsal cortex remains on one specimen. Similar tool forms have been
reported by Hall et al. (1986) from work at Choke Canyon Reservoir. Other distally
beveled tools similar in form are Clear Fork tools (Hester et al. 1973). However,
these two implements are distinct from Clear Fork tools in that they are shorter,
have overthickened cross sections with the greatest thickness just behind the bevel,
and have pointed to slightly rounded proximal ends.
Hester (2004:139, Figure 4.14) defines the Dimmitt tool (see also Nunley and
Hester 1966; Tomka 2002:83â84) and notes that they typically have quite a bit of
resharpening on them and are distributed across an area along the Rio Grande from
Eagle Pass to Falcon Reservoir and into adjacent regions. Tomka (2002:83) notes
that these tools have a hump-backed appearance. Those recovered in this project are
similar in form to Hall et al.âs (1986:326â328) Group 3, Forms 1 and 2, from sites
in Choke Canyon Reservoir. These include triangular beveled unifaces and bifaces
with pointed to rounded proximal ends and planoconvex to biconvex cross section.
These are shorter and smaller than Group 1 forms that are of morphologies and
sizes characteristic of Clear Fork implements.

The beveled bit edges of these implements are not battered or otherwise
damaged from impact against resistant materials such as wood. Both have edges
that have been carefully retouched by unifacial soft-hammer percussion, and
the edges are very slightly convex. Edge wear includes slight edge rounding and
occasional microscars with feather-and-step terminations onto the dorsal aspect and
development of a matte to medium polish on the ventral aspect of the edge. This type
of wear is commonly associated with scraping tasks, particularly in scraping softer
materials like soft wood, plant materials, and the like. Hester et al. (1969:152) note
that Dimmitt implements are distributed across a region of south Texas inclusive of
Dimmitt, Maverick, Starr, Webb, and Zapata Counties. Dimmitt tools are considered
to be associated with the Middle Archaic period (Hester 2004:149).

Uniface
A spall or flake fragment of silicified wood from Area 5 has steep unifacial
percussion along one portion of an edge. Edge rounding and other wear traces
suggest that it probably functioned as an expedient side scraper.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41MV319, situated on a T1 terrace between the present channel of Elm
Creek and a north-south tertiary channel, represents a prehistoric camp occupied
at various times over thousands of years. The testing included 18 backhoe trenches
and 4 test units. The excavations confirmed that cultural materials are present
throughout a 70â100-cm-thick Holocene alluvial mantle that overlies Pleistocene
alluvium or weathered Cretaceous bedrock. No features were identified, but cultural
zones marked by concentrations of fire-cracked rocks and debitage were noted at
various depths. Artifacts eroding at the surface, including two concentrations of
mussel shells, were found to be concentrated along the crest of the landform and
especially in gullies at the west edge, outside the tested area. Projectile points found
in these areas, and recovered in previous investigations, indicate occupations from
the Paleoindian period through the Late Prehistoric period.
The cultural materials recovered from the test units consist of 1,110 firecracked rocks, 303 pieces of debitage, 1 Scallorn arrow point, 1 Dimmitt tool, 3 cores, 76
snail shell fragments, and 5 mussel shell fragments. This equates to a moderately high
artifact density suggestive of relatively intensive use. Although artifacts are relatively
abundant and the Holocene deposits are generally thicker here than at the other tested
sites, it is impossible to isolate interpretable components with any certainty given the
long history of site use, lack of subsurface features, scarceness of diagnostic artifacts
in subsurface contexts, and lack of materials datable by radiocarbon. Further limiting
the interpretive usefulness of the site is the lack of floral and faunal data needed for
examining Native American subsistence practices. Because of these limitations, the
site lacks the ability to contribute important information and is considered ineligible
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
41MV394
Site Setting
Site 41MV394 is at the southern edge of the Eagle Pass Mine permit area. It
is situated on the narrow floodplain of a north-flowing tributary of Elm Creek and
the adjacent upland surface that interfaces with the floodplain by way of a gentle
eroded bedrock slope (Figure 37). Site dimensions are ca. 100 m north-south by
50 m east-west, with elevations ranging from 779 ft at the north end of the site to
782 ft upslope at the south end. The site supports a cover of mesquite and hackberry
trees with grasses, shrubs, and cacti. The densest vegetation follows the tributary
channel. Away from the channel, ground surface visibility ranges from moderate (30
percent) to good (70 percent) with plentiful gravels, fire-cracked rocks, and debitage
present at the surface. Mining impacts are planned for the northern and southern
parts of the site.

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
Previous Investigations
Site 41MV394 was first identified in 2014 during survey of 1,460 acres
conducted by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Norment et al. 2015:25â30). The site
appeared to be a surface scatter of artifacts that included fire-cracked rocks, lithic
debitage, biface fragments, flake tools, and two diagnostic projectile points. A possible
hearth, some 2 m across, was also noted on the surface at the south end of the site.
The projectile points consisted of a Clovis-like fragment and a Langtry dart point
(Norment et al. 2015:Figures 9f and 10e). Although most of the base of the Clovislike point was missing, evidence of flutes on both the dorsal and ventral surfaces
could be discerned. These points suggested the site could have Paleoindian as well
as Middle to Late Archaic period components.
Because of the obviously surficial nature of most of the site, the possibility
that it contains buried materials initially appeared to be low. However, three backhoe
trenches were dug to examine its east edge adjacent to the tributary channel, and
one at the southeast edge of the site found cultural materials consisting of several
burned rocks and pieces of debitage at depths of 15 to 30 cm below the surface. As a
result, test excavations focused on this area were recommend to further explore the
extent of these buried materials and determine the siteâs National Register eligibility.
Work Accomplished
Testing consisted of five backhoe trenches, two test units (1x1 m), intensive
surface scrutiny for diagnostic artifacts, and geomorphic reassessment of the site,
with the excavations confined to the southeastern edge of the site. The trenches were
oriented generally east-west following the edge of the tributary channel and ranged
in length from 6.0 to 7.7 m and in depth from 1.0 to 1.7 m. Trench 5 reopened the
survey trench where buried cultural material was previously observed, widening
it to 2.2 m. Cleaning and recording of the trenches showed that only Trenches 4
and 5 had artifacts in the walls or floors. Detailed soil descriptions were made for
Trenches 1 and 4. All trenches were photographed, and their locations were mapped.
Test units were placed off of Trenches 4 and 5 to explore the materials noted
there. Test Unit 1, at the southwest end of Trench 5, was 40 cm deep below the
present surface, but the upper 20 cm was backdirt from the original survey trench
and was discarded. Test Unit 2 was placed on the south wall of Trench 4; it extended
to 75 cm below the surface, but the upper 40 cm was discarded as it was deemed to
be a recent alluvial deposit. A concentration of fire-cracked rocks was noted at 75 cm
below the surface in Test Unit 4. It corresponded to a small concentration of firecracked rocks seen in the floor of Trench 4 at 80 cm below the surface In all, 0.55 m3
of sediment were excavated and screened from these units. No diagnostic artifacts
were recovered from the test units or trenches, and only one projectile point was
found on the surface of the site. It is a Frio dart point found near Trenches 3 and 5.
Site Sediments
Soils maps do not distinguish between the two geomorphic surfaces, a narrow
floodplain and adjacent upland surface, on which 41MV394 sits, undoubtedly because

Chapter 4: Results of Testing
the floodplain is so small and ephemeral. Both are mapped as Pryor association,
undulating (Web Soil Survey 2017). Pryor soils are deep, well-drained, calcareous
upland Aridisols formed in calcareous clays and clay loam over soft shale (National
Cooperative Soil Survey 2017d). Nor is the boundary between these two surfaces
marked by any sharp break in topography.
The profiles of two of the trenches (1 and 4) were examined and described
(see Appendix A). These trenches traverse the narrow floodplain surface and the
edge of the upland slope. Both profiles display a wedge of late Holocene alluvium
overlying and inset to weathered Cretaceous bedrock (Figure 38). Both are mantled
by recent slope alluvium. On the floodplain, the deposits of recent slope alluvium
are 66â94 cm thick, pinching out upslope to the west. These deposits consist of dark
grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and brown (10YR 5/3) clay loam and silty clay loam that
are minimally altered with some exhibiting depositional structures in the form of
discontinuous or broken laminae and beds of very fine sand; they are designated
as either AC or C horizons.
In Trench 1, the recent slope alluvium overlies a very late Holocene channel
fill comprised of multiple 10â12-cm-thick upward-fining couplets of very dark grayish
brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) to light yellowish
brown (10YR 6/4) fine sand. Below the channel fill is a 20-cm-thick 2Ab horizon
formed on late Holocene alluvium. This alluvium rests on and is laterally inset to
weathered Cretaceous bedrock. The very late Holocene channel fill is not present
in Trench 4, however, a deposit of altered late Holocene alluvium resting on and
laterally inset to bedrock is present.

92

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
The wedge of late to very late Holocene alluvium and the more-recent slope
alluvium inset to the bedrock, although not volumetrically or laterally extensive, do
contain cultural materials. These materials probably represent an extension of the
chronologically late archeological materials that are exposed on the adjacent upland
and slope surfaces. The age of these buried materials is probably Late Archaic to Late
Prehistoric, possibly even Historic, given the presumed late to very late Holocene
and recent ages of the sedimentary packages. These ages are substantiated by the
minimal degree of soil formation observed on these sediments.
Site Extent and Depth
Site 41MV394 was determined to be ca. 50 m east-west and 100 m northsouth by the 2014 site survey (Norment et al. 2015:25â30); the test excavations
reported here do not change that estimate. However, the trenches and test units
excavated at the southeastern edge of the site do provide additional information
on the horizontal and vertical extent of the buried cultural materials. Combined
with surface evidence and the results of trenching during survey, these excavations
indicate that buried materials are limited horizontally to a strip of floodplain
that is less than 10 m wide and about 40 m long on the west side of the tributary
channel. Only two of the five trenches placed here (Trenches 1 and 4) contained
artifacts.

Test Unit 1, placed on the southwest end of Trench 5 at the interface of the
narrow floodplain and the upland slope, produced cultural materials in Levels 3
and 4, which correspond to 0â20 cm below the original surface since Levels 1 and
2 consisted of backdirt from a survey-phase trench and were discarded without
screening (Table 9). The majority of the cultural materials recovered from the
unit are from the Holocene alluvium in Level 3 just above Cretaceous bedrock. At
the east end of Trench 5, bedrock drops to ca. 170 cm
below recent slope alluvium, late Holocene alluvium,

Test Unit 2 was placed central to Trench 4
on its south wall to explore a scatter of seven firecracked rocks noted in the floor of the trench at ca.
75 cm below the surface. These rocks were sitting on
or close to bedrock. The first four levels within the unit
consisted of recent slope alluvium, and since artifacts
were not noted in this alluvium, it was removed by the
backhoe. Hand excavation started at 40 cm below the
surface, and four levels were excavated through late
Holocene alluvium to Cretaceous bedrock at 75 cm
below the surface. Artifacts, consisting almost entirely
of fire-cracked rocks, were sparse in this unit and
concentrated in the lowermost level, consistent with

Chapter 4: Results of Testing

93

the rocks noted in the trench floor. The floors of the unit and adjacent trench were
cleaned to discern any connection between the rocks in them, but the rocks appeared
to be scattered rather than clustered and hence were not designated as a feature.
Features
No features were defined during the testing. The sole feature recorded is a
possible burned rock hearth remnant ca. 2 m in diameter noted on the surface of
the upland slope during survey (Norment et al. 2015:25â30).
Materials Recovered
A total of 94 fire-cracked rocks, 19 pieces of debitage, and 3 Rabdotus sp.
snail shell fragments were recovered from screening the fill of the two test units. In
addition, a Frio dart point was recovered from the surface near Trenches 3 and 5.
The fire-cracked rocks in the test units are mostly small fragments less than 5 cm
in diameter with a few in Level 8 of Test Unit 2 being 5â10 cm. All are the same
kinds of rocks seen on the surface, i.e., Uvalde Gravels composed of chert, limestone,
sandstone, quartzite, and igneous rock.
Debitage
The 19 pieces of debitage consist of 9 flakes with striking platforms present,
6 chips, and 4 chunks. Cortex is present on 7 pieces or 37 percent, while 10 pieces or
53 percent appear to have been heated. Edwards chert predominates with 16 pieces
of brown, gray, and dark gray debitage. The remaining pieces consist of 2 chips of
petrified wood and 1 chip from an igneous rock.

chert (Figure 39). The stem is side notched, and stem basal edges are
concave with flaring ears. Given its unfinished appearance, it may be a
Frio preform with the distal end broken by an end shock fracture. The Frio
dart point type is a Late Archaic style across all of central and southwest
Texas (Collins 2004:113; Hester 2004:140; Turner et al. 2011:106). This
point, along with the Clovis-like and Langtry points recovered from the site
during survey, indicate that the site has multiple components reflecting a
long history of use.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41MV394 is on the upland slopeâfloodplain interface along a
small north-flowing tributary of Elm Creek, well back from the valley wall.
Initial survey found that most of the site is eroded with cultural materials
exposed at the surface, but some cultural materials are shallowly buried
within narrow floodplain deposits at the southeastern edge. Five trenches
and two test units were excavated in this area Sparse fire-cracked rocks
(n = 94), debitage (n = 19), and a few snail shell fragments were found in

thin Holocene alluvium sitting on Cretaceous bedrock. However, the integrity of
these materials is questionable as no features were identified, and it is possible the
artifacts were redeposited by erosion into the Holocene alluvium from the adjacent
upland slope.
No materials datable by radiocarbon were found, and the few temporally
diagnostic artifacts found during testing and survey indicate sporadic use over a
very long span of time, i.e., in the Paleoindian and Middle and Late Archaic periods.
Based on this, the questionable context of the remains, the inability to isolate
interpretable components, and the lack of faunal and botanical remains informative
about subsistence practices, the interpretive value of the site is limited. Since it lacks
the capacity to contribute information important to Texas prehistory, 41MV394 is
considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

CHAPTER 5: GEOMORPHIC AND
ARCHEOLOGICAL SUMMARIES AND NATIONAL
REGISTER ASSESSMENTS

The following geomorphic and archeological summaries focus on the current
investigations, although previous investigations at the Eagle Pass Mine are
considered and referenced where particularly relevant. Seven archeological sites
situated in alluvial settings on the Elm Creek valley floor, the Elm Creek valley
margin, and a tributary of Elm Creek were investigated. The three settings display
different geomorphologies and depositional and erosional histories and thus have
varying preservation, contextual, and visibility potentials for archeology.
SUMMARY OF THE GEOMORPHIC INVESTIGATIONS
Elm Creek Valley Floor
Within and around the mine area, Elm Creek exhibits a broad valley floor
that is traversed by multiple channels. The fluvial geomorphology closely resembles
an anastamosing channel system, i.e., a system with multiple active channels. Based
on channel morphology, depth, and width, Frederick (in Turpin et al. 2010) identifies
three channel types in the valley: the primary channel of Elm Creek, secondary
channels of Elm Creek, and tertiary channels.
The primary channel represents Elm Creekâs current and active course that
carries the base flow and much of the runoff in the system. It is a deeply incised,
narrow channel with a thalweg about 4 m below the local floodplain surface.
Secondary channels are interpreted as former courses of Elm Creek that were
abandoned through avulsion. They tend to be wider and less deeply incised below the
local floodplain. Both channel types are moderately sinuous. Based on observations
made by Frederick and during the current investigations, both types appear to
run bank full, at least during high rainfall events, judging from the amount of tree
limb, grass, and artificial debris flotsam deposited at or near the elevation of the
floodplain. These two channel types are not only active today, at least periodically,
but they also were active for significant portions of the Holocene.
The tertiary channels are a series of much smaller, straight to slightly
sinuous channels that are shallow and run parallel to the long axis of the valley.
They are shallow upstream but become deeper and better defined downstream. This,
along with the fact that they tend to cross the inside of meanders of the primary
and secondary channels, suggests that they formed through erosion during flood
events and act more like chutes than formal channels.

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
The multiple channels give the Elm Creek valley floor a corrugated
topography consisting of elevated linear ridges flanked by the channels and their
local floodplains. The surfaces of these interfluvial ridges, referred to as T1 surfaces
in this report, are flat to very gently convex. It is on these surfaces where most of the
archeological sites along Elm Creek are found. For the current project, this includes
41MV185, 41MV189, 41MV190, 41MV202, and 41MV319.
The stratigraphy of the interfluvial ridges can be complex. Commonly, their
core consists of pedogenically altered bedrock with Holocene, and in some places
Pleistocene (e.g., 41MV319), alluvium inset to the margins of the bedrock core and
draping its top. Holocene alluvium inset to the margins of bedrock core certainly
has the potential for intact archeological deposits, but it is the Holocene alluvium
mantling the surfaces of the ridges where most of the sites are found and where
archeological visibility is greatest due to deflation of the surface and erosion along
the margins. Whether these expressions provide an accurate reflection of the full
archeological record is not clear, but it makes sense that occupation focused on
the elevated and broader T1 surfaces as opposed to the narrower lower surfaces of
inset fill adjacent to the channels. And although these laterally inset Holocene fills
were not thoroughly examined during the current investigations, deep mechanical
excavations during previous investigations encountered few cultural materials
compared to those contained in the Holocene veneers mantling the T1 surfaces.
Whereas the inset Holocene fills may be 4 m or more thick, the Holocene
veneers are often relatively thin, usually 1 m or less. Their contact with the
underlying bedrock (or Pleistocene alluvial drape, if present) is often marked by
a clear to gradual boundary making it difficult to distinguish the exact boundary
between culturally relevant and nonrelevant deposits at times. Based on the
characteristics of the soil imprints on these alluvial mantles and the cultural
materials they encapsulate, these drapes are estimated to range in age from early to
middle Holocene to middle to late Holocene. The assortment of temporally diagnostic
artifacts found on the T1 surfaces and within the Holocene alluvial mantle indicates
that many of the sites were occupied multiple times throughout and after deposition
of the mantle.
The margins of the interfluvial ridges are typically eroded or capped by
recent slope alluvium that interfingers downslope with the alluvium of the adjacent
floodplain. The surfaces of these eroded margins are often littered with dense
concentrations of artifacts. The artifact density clearly is the result of erosion
concentrating materials on the surface, given the meager recovery of artifacts from
excavations on the T1 surfaces at multiple sites.
Narrow floodplains flank the primary and secondary channels below the T1
surfaces. Only at 41MV202 were the deposits below a floodplain surface examined.
Here, the upper deposits (ca. 1 m thick) are recent in age with no potential for
prehistoric archeology, but these recent deposits can bury pedogenically altered late
Holocene alluvium. Frederick noted during his investigations that the floodplain
deposits range between 3 and 4 m thick and consist mostly of late Holocene alluvium.
He also noted that, although they are narrow, the floodplains are not so small as to

Chapter 5: Summaries and National Register Assessments
have been uninhabitable. No cultural materials were observed below the floodplain
surface at 41MV202 during the current investigations, however.
Elm Creek Valley Margin
Gravel-mantled uplands in and around the mine area contribute large
amounts of coarse-grained material to the interface of the Elm Creek valley wall and
bottom. The processes that deliver and deposit this material are not conducive to
preserving archeological sites that may be in the path of transport. However, these
gravel-mantled uplands also contribute large amounts of fine-grained sediments
derived from the underlying Cretaceous bedrock. At 41MV149, artifacts and features
are encased in the fine-grained distal margins of late Holocene slope alluvium that
overlies more-gravelly deposits of slope alluvium. This change from gravel-dominated
to finer-grained deposits is due to retreat of the valley wall over time. Stepping back
of the valley wall coupled with an endless source of fine-grained sediment upslope
make the valley margins along Elm Creek good locales for site preservation, as is
demonstrated at 41MV149.
Elm Creek Tributary Valley
Fredrick (in Turpin et al. 2010) found the fluvial geomorphology of tributary
streams of Elm Creek varies greatly. The valley floors of some are relatively simple,
lacking terraces and containing dark-colored alluvium that is probably middle to late
Holocene in age. However, other Elm Creek tributaries have surprisingly complex
stratigraphy with multiple constructional surfaces and at least five Holocene and
late Pleistocene alluvial deposits (Frederick and Stahman 2011). The geomorphology
and stratigraphy at 41MV394 on a tributary of Elm Creek investigated for this
project are not complex, although they did hold their own surprises.
Site 41MV394 is situated on an upland slope overlooking a segment of a
small north-flowing unnamed tributary of Elm Creek before it enters the Elm Creek
valley. A wedge of Holocene alluvium is inset to the bedrock, resting below a small
floodplain surface that bridges the upland slope and stream channel. The overall
volume of alluvial sediment preserved is surprising for such a small, high-gradient
stream. A minimal degree of soil formation observed on these sediments suggests
a late to very late Holocene age, which in turn suggests that these high-gradient
streams (before they enter the Elm Creek valley) are probably periodically stripped
of their alluvium and contain no older alluvial units. Cultural materials encapsulated
in this alluvium represent an extension of the materials that are exposed on the
adjacent upland and slope surfaces.
Conclusions
Geomorphic investigations conducted for the current project revealed varying
degrees of site preservation, visibility, and contextual integrity across the different
settings and landforms of the sites investigated. On the valley floor of Elm Creek, the
potential for site preservation and integrity appear to be greatest across the broad
and nearly level T1 terrace surfaces that are mantled by generally thin alluvium

97

98

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
of varying Holocene ages. The eroded margins of these surfaces tend to have the
highest site visibility with dense concentrations of cultural materials on the surface,
but these materials are in poor context. Nonetheless, these surface materials are
derived from the adjacent intact Holocene veneer on the T1 surfaces, and thus this
visibility can be used to identify and delineate the portions of sites with integrity.
Thicker Holocene alluvial units inset to the bedrock cores of the terraces have the
greatest potential to yield sites with good integrity, but currently this potential has
not been clearly demonstrated. Floodplains on the valley floor also have the potential
for yielding sites, but this potential too remains to be demonstrated.
The margins of the Elm Creek valley are also places of good site preservation.
Here, the fine-grained distal margins of slope alluvium deposited at the interface
of the valley wall and bottom have been shown to have the potential for site
preservation and integrity, although site visibility may be low. Retreat of the valley
wall through time has resulted in migration of the distal margins of the valley wall
farther away from the valley axis. Thus, the deposits with the best potential for site
preservation are late in age (late Holocene or later in the case of 41MV149), since
older slope alluvium has been eroded away or reworked through lateral migration
of the trunk stream.
Surprisingly, high-gradient tributaries of Elm Creek before they enter the
valley of the trunk stream also have some potential for sites with integrity within
small packets of late to very late Holocene alluvium. Such settings provide high
site visibility and poor context on the adjacent upland and upland slope, but there
is the potential for good integrity if Holocene alluvium is inset (and preserved) to
the bedrock and included cultural materials can be shown to be in situ.
SUMMARY OF THE ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
The archeological testing at seven sites in the Elm Creek drainage as it
crosses the Eagle Pass Mine permit area identified site characteristics that can
be used to construct a general picture of prehistoric human activity in the area.
All of the sites have buried archeological deposits, mostly at shallow depths, in
Holocene alluvium on the valley floor (41MV185, 41MV189, 41MV190, 41MV202,
and 41MV319), at the base of the valley wall (41MV149), or in a small tributary
valley (41MV394). However, the slow rate of deposition and extensive and repeated
episodes of erosion have conflated the deposits of varying ages, precluding the
opportunity to define discrete cultural components. Because of this, the generally
low artifact densities, the poor preservation of faunal and floral remains, and the
near-absence of datable materials, none of these sites holds the kinds of important
information needed to address substantive questions concerning the prehistory of
south Texas. Thus, what can be gleaned from them regarding prehistoric human
activity in the Elm Creek valley is limited.
Sites On the Elm Creek Valley Floor
Sites 41MV185, 41MV189, 41MV190, 41MV202, and 41MV319 are on
terraces on the Elm Creek valley floor. The tested areas, which in some cases are

Chapter 5: Summaries and National Register Assessments
constrained by the locations of planned impacts from mining and the Elm Creek
Protection Plan buffer, vary dramatically in size from 7,800 m2 at 41MV189 to
71,000 m2 at 41MV202 (Table 10). These constraints aside, differences in site size
in this setting are not meaningful culturally. Archeological materials are nearly
ubiquitous here, with site definition being largely a function of variable surface
exposure due to differences in vegetation cover and erosion. In some places (e.g.,
41MV189 and 41MV190), sites are contiguous, with distinctions between them
based more on convenience for recording than changes in the archeology. Native
Americans intermittently used and established small camps on these terraces for
millenia, and whatever meaningful spatial relationships might once have existed
between the remains of these occupations have been obscured by overprinting.
Having said that, this is a setting that Native Americans clearly favored over a
long time span, presumably because it provided access to water, firewood, and
various subsistence resources and perhaps because it provided more shelter
from the elements than the surrounding uplands. The fact that, among the tested
sites, the densities of fire-cracked rocks and debitage are highest at 41MV202
and 41MV319 speaks to the popularity of the valley floor as a place for setting up
camp (see Table 10).

Most of the cultural deposits are shallowly buried within the upper part
of the Holocene alluvial mantle, i.e., the upper 20 cm at 41MV189 and most of
41MV190 and the upper 40 cm at 41MV202 and parts of 41MV185 and 41MV319.
Slightly deeper concentrations of remains in parts of 41MV185 (30â60 cm in Test
Unit 2), 41MV190 (20â60 cm in Test Unit 2), and 41MV319 (30â60 and 70â90 cm in
Test Unit 1 and 30â50 cm in Test Unit 4) hint at less erosion and conflation of the
cultural deposits in some locations, but only Test Unit 1 at 41MV319 has a multipeak
distributional pattern suggestive of vertically stacked components. The absence of
features, temporally diagnostic tools, and datable materials in this unit makes it
impossible to assess this suggestion further, though. At all of the sites, the thinness
of the deposits and their conflated nature preclude teasing apart components based
on depth of burial.

Notes: Additional point styles found in previous investigations are in italics. Excludes unidentified and
nondiagnostic (e.g., Abasolo and Palmillas) dart points from 41MV185, 41MV189, 41MV202, and 41MV319.

Sites 41MV185, 41MV189, and 41MV319 appear to have Early Archaic
components, and all five sites have Middle Archaic and Late Archaic components.
Based on projectile points alone, all but 4MV202 have Late Prehistoric components,
but the recovery of a ceramic sherd from 41MV202 indicates a late occupations there
as well. The few Dimmitt and Clear Fork tools found at 41MV190, 41MV202, and
41MV319 are consistent with the presence of Archaic components at these sites.
Site 41MV319 has the broadest range of point styles, suggesting the most consistent
reuse over time, although this may be a function simply of the larger sample size.
Late Archaic points are most frequent by far, indicating that this was a time of
relatively intensive occupation. Early and Middle Archaic points are much less
common, and Paleoindian and Late Prehistoric points are least frequent, implying
less consistent or intensive use.
Despite the inability to define discrete components, the feature types
identified and artifacts collected provide some evidence of the kinds of activities

Chapter 5: Summaries and National Register Assessments
Native Americans performed there. Fire-cracked rock concentrations and
scatters, both as surface and near-surface features, are present at all of the
sites. Concentrations likely representing general purpose camp hearths were
found during these investigations at 41MV185 and 41MV190 and in previous
investigations at 41MV202 and 41MV319. These hearths, in most cases less than
1 m in diameter, appear to be scattered across the sites suggesting a series of small
group occupations. Missing at these sites are features interpreted as earth ovens,
as have been found at some other sites at the mine (Stahman et al. 2011), although
it is possible that the midden at 41MV202 represents a series of disaggregated
oven features, Certainly, the ubiquitous scattered fire-cracked rocks at all the sites
reflect the remains of former facilities used for heating and cooking a variety of
kinds of plant and animal foods.
Another feature type is the mussel shell concentration, two of which were
found on the surface at 41MV319, with scattered shell fragments found on most of
the other sites perhaps being from other concentrations. A grab sample of mostly
whole valves from one of the features contains shells identified as Tampico Pearly
Mussel (Cyrtonaias tampicoensis) and Yellow Sand Shell (Lampsilis teres). These
have a wide range across Texas, as they are found both in large and small streams and
rivers and can survive in turbid water conditions with both a rock or mud substrate.
Both would not be out of place in Elm Creek, and they surely were collected as a
subsistence item. Less certain to represent food remains are the Rabdotus snail
shells. They occur at all sites, but they are not common, and their contexts do not
make it clear that they are cultural.
Artifact recovery from the valley floor sites, excluding fire-cracked rocks that
make up hearth and midden features as well as nonfeature scatters, is generally
low. The density of tools, even at 41MV202 with a midden, is less than or close
to 1 per cubic meter excavated (see Table 10); like the scattered heath features,
these low densities suggest short-term occupations. However, the kinds of tools
recovered suggest that a wide range of site activities took place at these valley sites.
Recovery included projectile points, bifacial knives, unifaces, metate fragments, a
hammerstone, ground stone axe fragments, and chipped stone adzes (Dimmitt and
Clear Fork tools). Among the activities suggested are hunting of game and retooling
for future hunting, butchering and hide processing, processing of plant foods, and
manufacture of wooden implements or facilities.
Certainly, stone tool manufacture was an important activity at all sites, as
indicated by the ubiquity of debitage. Debitage densities are variable however, from
16.4 per cubic meter at 41MV185 to 181.3 at 41MV202, indicating that the intensity
of tool manufacture varied from site to site along with overall occupational intensity.
The debitage, which consists of both corticate and decorticate flakes, indicates both
early and late-stage manufacture, which is not surprising given that raw materials
are abundant locally. The cores recovered from 41MV185, 41MV190, 41MV202,
and 41MV319 attest to tool manufacture, with the two small microflake cores from
41MV190 representing specialized production of flakes useful for gravers, small
drills, or small cutting tools.

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
Sites on the Elm Creek Valley Margin
Sites 41MV149 and 41MV394 are both at the margins of the Elm Creek valley.
Site 41MV149 is on a slope and base of the Elm Creek valley wall cut by a tributary
of Hediondo Creek, which is a tributary of Elm Creek. The site as a whole covers
a very large area, but most of it consists of sparse fire-cracked rocks and debitage
mixed with Uvalde Gravels scattered on the surface of the upland valley wall; this
area may have been used mostly for lithic procurement. Holocene alluvium rests on
weathered Cretaceous bedrock at the base of the slope at the east edge of the site,
and the present investigations looked only at this area. Testing found remnants
of a fire-cracked rock concentration buried 20 cm below the surface; this feature
appears similar to disarticulated hearths present on the upslope surface. Artifact
recovery from this feature and from the excavations in general were very low (see
Table 10), implying very limited use. The recovery of Frio and Pedernales dart points,
along with a Kinney point found during previous investigations, suggests this use
occurred in multiple episodes during the Middle and Late Archaic periods. The
limited remains, restricted to fire-cracked rocks, debitage, and a dart point, suggest
a very limited range of activities and imply that the downslope part of 41MV149
was used as a special-purpose camp.
Site 41MV349 is on a small tributary floodplain and adjacent upland slope
well back from where that stream reaches the Elm Creek valley wall. It is the
smallest site investigated, with the tested area consisting only of one edge along the
tributary. Testing found evidence of hearth remnants and sparse debitage reflecting
nonintensive use shallowly buried in recent deposits. A Frio dart point recovered
from the surface and Clovis-like and Langtry points found during the initial site
survey indicate a very long history of use in the Paleoindian and Middle and Late
Archaic periods. Given the paucity of artifacts, this use must have been very sporadic
and short term. The minimal tool recovery implies the site was a special-purpose
extraction camp, such as a hunting station.
Conclusions
The information from these seven sites adds modestly to the body of knowledge
from 13 other sites at the Eagle Pass Mine that have seen some level of testing or
data recovery excavation (see Table 1). These data present a coarse-grained and
fragmented view of Native American use of the Elm Creek valley, though, because
most sites are shallowly buried if at all, most sites were used intermittently over
long spans of time, all occupations appear to have been nonintensive such that no
individual component overwhelms the others, it is impossible to isolate components
with any certainty, and organic materials are poorly preserved making it difficult to
date sites reliably by radiocarbon and obtain information on subsistence via samples
of botanical and faunal remains.
These shortcomings aside, the combined chronological indicators (i.e.,
radiocarbon dates, projectile point styles, and the presence of a ceramic sherd at
one site) suggest that the area was used most intensively during the Late Archaic
period, with 80 percent of the 20 tested or excavated sites apparently having

Chapter 5: Summaries and National Register Assessments
materials of this age (see Tables 1 and 11). Late Prehistoric and Middle Archaic
components are only slightly less frequent (65 percent each), and Early Archaic
(30 percent) and Paleoindian (10 percent) components are least common. These
chronological indicators are not all equally reliable, however, with the radiocarbon
dates skewed toward the Late Prehistoric period (48 percent of the components
with dates) compared to the diagnostic artifacts (19 percent of the components with
diagnostics). This undoubtedly reflects a bias toward preservation of more-recent
organic materials, and it raises the question of whether some of the materials
that yielded late dates are intrusive rather than archeological. Minus this biased
indicator, Late Archaic remains appear even more predominant.
Excepting a handful of sites, such as 41MV149 and 41MV394, that have very
limited kinds of remains and that could be special-purpose extraction camps (or
maybe they look like that simply because their assemblages are so small), most sites
appear to have been generally equivalent functionally, i.e., small general-purpose
camps where a variety of procurement, extractive, and maintenance tasks were
performed. Of course, fire-cracked rocks and chipped stone debitage are ubiquitous,
and most have concentrations of burned rocks that have been interpreted as hearths
with varying degrees of integrity, ovens, or debris removed from these kinds of
features. At some locations, the debris is distributed such that it constitutes middens.
As oven features have been identified in various ways, the functional distinctions
between them and hearths and burned rock concentrations are not always clear.
Nonetheless, it is safe to say that, as a group, these represent facilities used to cook
plant and animal foods and provide heat, as would be expected at camp sites. A
single site (41MV189) contained a Late Prehistoric period human burial, but it was
isolated and not part of a cemetery, and nothing else about this site distinguishes
it from the others.
The sites have yielded varying quantities of stone tools (both chipped and
ground). Where tool types are few (like 41MV149 and 41MV394), limited ranges of
activities may be indicated, although this could be a function of small sample sizes
instead. Where samples are large (like 41MV319), tool variety is greater, suggesting
greater ranges of activities. Given that the collections are aggregates representing
many episodes of occupation, however, such a conclusion cannot be applied to any
particular component or time period. One artifact type found only during the testing
reported here is aboriginal ceramics. The single sherd from 41MV202 is interesting
in that it suggests connections with pottery-using groups from neighboring regions
during the Late Prehistoric period, since Native groups who occupied the Elm Creek
valley did not have that technology, but it does not have any bearing on functional
interpretation of that site.

ages and kinds of cultural remains. All seven sites are considered to lack the capacity
to contribute important information for understanding Native American use of south
Texas, and hence they are judged ineligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places. The key factors in this assessment are as follows: (1) they have low
contextual integrity because they are in settings that aggraded slowly during the
Holocene and were disturbed repeatedly by erosion; (2) they are shallowly buried,
making it impossible to separate the remains of what appear to be intermittent
occupations over long spans of time into interpretable components; (3) all occupations
appear to have been nonintensive, and no individual component can be shown to
be laterally extensive and predominant over others at any site, further limiting the
ability to isolate interpretable components; (4) datable materials are very scarce,
making it impossible to know the ages of the site components with any certainty;
and (5) organic materials are poorly preserved such that information on subsistence
practices (i.e., botanical and faunal remains) is essentially nonexistent. The testing
data from these sites contribute modestly to the body of knowledge about the
prehistory of the region, but the sites retain no important information beyond that.

APPENDIX B: Analysis of Human Skeletal Remains from 41MV189
INTRODUCTION
During Summer 2017, Prewitt and Associates, Inc., undertook archeological
testing at 41MV189, including a reassessment of previously identified skeletal
remains associated with Feature 1. Test excavations consisted of seven backhoe
trenches, one Gradall-stripped area, four 1x1-m test units, an extensive surface
survey, and a geomorphic reassessment with a goal to determine if there were
additional associated human burial features and how they may relate to the other
cultural deposits on the site. No additional human burial features were discovered,
and thus attention was focused on the exposure, mapping, photography, exhumation,
and analysis of the human skeletal remains associated with Feature 1.
The skeletonized human remains associated with Feature 1 were delivered
to the Forensic Anthropology Center at Texas State (FACTS) in early September
2017 by Eloise Gadus, staff archeologist with Prewitt and Associates. Custody
of the human skeletal remains was transferred to Dr. Kate Spradley, Associate
Professor, Texas State University. Nondestructive skeletal analysis was completed by
Christopher Wolfe, M.A., under the guidance of Dr. Spradley to discern the biological
profile of the human skeletal remains and any adjoining skeletal evidence indicative
of biological, cultural, and taphonomic processes.
The human skeletal remains were documented and analyzed per protocols
outlined by Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994). The remains were mostly clean upon
arrival with the exception of a few elements adhering to larger clumps of soil
matrix. All skeletal material was cleaned with wooden tools to remove large areas
of soil, followed by the use of soft-bristle toothbrushes. All skeletal elements and
fragments were examined for cultural, biologic, and taphonomic change, followed
by photographic documentation. Dental inventory and pathology was completed
separate from the skeletal inventory and adhered to the WinID dental identification
system (American Board of Forensic Odontology 2014).

ANALYSIS OF THE SKELETAL REMAINS

Inventory
The skeleton is fragmentary with no complete elements present. Figure B.1
shows the identifiable elements present and does not include bulk bone fragments
that could not be sided or identified to a single element. The fragmentation of the
skeletal remains is most likely the result of the taphonomic processes within the
depositional environment (see Taphonomy). Moreover, because of the fragmentary
nature of the skeleton, the estimation of the biological profile (age, sex, stature, and
ancestral affiliation) is limited in scope.
Dental Inventory
There are 24 of 32 teeth present (Figure B.2). No teeth are present in
occlusion. Additionally, only a fragmentary portion of the mandible is present with
no little to no evidence of the maxilla. This report uses the Universal Numbering

Missing teeth include numbers 2, 15, 16, 19,
20, 29, 30, and 31. Numbers 2, 15, and 16
were all lost postmortem, while numbers
19, 20, 29, 30, and 31 were lost antemortem
as evidenced by resorption of the alveolar
bone of the mandible. Pathology of the
dentition includes few carious lesions,
resorption of the alveolar bone indicative
of periodontal disease, and severe dental
wear (see Pathology).
Sex Estimation

Figure B.1. Photograph of identifiable elements from
Feature 1 at 41MV189.

The pelvis provides the best estimate
of sex, followed by long bones and the skull.
Due to the condition of the skeletal remains,
no bony features commonly associated
with the gross morphological assessment
of biological sex are available. Next, few
postcranial elements are available to
undertake a metric assessment to estimate
biological sex. Portions of the humerus and
femur are intact enough to complete sex
estimation via a few metric measurements.
Utilizing methods outlined in Spradley
and Jantz (2011), the current individual
is a possible female. However, the method
outlined above is based on American black
and white populations. Previous research
suggests population-specific methods are
the most-accurate means to estimate sex
(Spradley et al. 2015). Therefore, the metric
technique outlined in Spradley and Jantz
(2011) may misclassify individuals not of
American black or white affiliation, such
as the current individual from 41MV189.
Techniques designed for Mexican Hispanic
populations may provide a better estimate
(albeit still not exact) due to the similar
population histories of Native American and
Mexican Hispanic populations. However,
the elements necessary for sex estimation
based on the Mexican Hispanic methods
(Spradley et al. 2015; Tise et al. 2013) are
not complete enough for analysis.

APPENDIX B: Analysis of Human Skeletal Remains from 41MV189
Figure B.2

Figure B.2. Dental remains from Feature 1 at 41MV189.

Features of the skull are subject to some sexual dimorphism in gross
morphological traits (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994), however these traits are
variable and population specific and, for this reason, should only be used in
conjunction with other methods to estimate sex. The only feature present on the
current individual is the mental eminence and/or chin morphology (Figure B.3).
While there is a robust mental eminence, the mandibular body is round, with a
pointed chin and overall gracility. The morphology of the mandible, the metric

131

132

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
analysis of the humerus and femur (although based on nonspecific techniques),
and the overall small and gracile nature of the remainder of the skeleton suggest
the current individual is a female.
Age Estimation
Skeletal age at death is estimated via a multifactorial approach utilizing
degeneration of various bony elements including the pubic symphysis, auricular
surface, and the sternal end of the fourth rib in adult individuals. However, due to
the fragmentary nature of the skeleton, none of the above-described elements are
available. Of the elements present, all epiphyses are complete, and dental eruption
is complete with all third molars present with complete root closure. Therefore, the
individual must have been at least 21 years old. Dental wear is sometimes used
to estimate the age of an individual, but this technique is fraught with error and
dependent on concomitant factors such as diet, ancestry, sex, etc. (Buikstra and
Ubelaker 1994). No joint surfaces are present to assess arthritic change and skeletal
degeneration that would indicate an individual of older age.

Pathological Assessment
Due to the condition of the skeleton, the scope of the pathological analysis
is limited. With that said, the preservation of the mandible and adjoining dentition
suggests overall poor oral health. Tooth numbers 1, 18, and 32 all show evidence of
carious lesions indicative of proliferative infection and destruction of tooth structure
and adjoining tissues (Ortner 2003). Tooth 1 (Figure B.4, left) has a carious lesion
at the root that involves complete destruction of enamel and dentine tissue on
the lingual surface with exposure of the pulp chamber. Tooth 18 (see Figure B.4,
middle) also has a carious lesion of the root with destruction of the lingual tooth
surface extending into the pulp chamber. Lastly, Tooth 32 (see Figure B.4, right)
has an occlusal surface carie extending into the pulp chamber. Moreover, there is
considerable resorption of the mandibular alveolar bone suggesting periodontal
disease. The exposure of tooth roots as a result of periodontal disease leads to the
introduction of proliferative bacteria and may lead to the carious lesions at the roots
described above.
Figure B.4
The poor oral health
is most likely exacerbated
by severe dental attrition.
Surface wear of the incisor,
canines, and premolars fall
into a score of 8 (Smith 1984),
while the molars fall into a
score of 8 or 9 (Scott 1979).
In all teeth, there is a severe
loss of crown height with little

of the root (Buikstra and

Ubelaker 1994). The most
likely culprit of such severe
dental wear is a highly abrasive
diet. The tooth wear present in this individual is not uncommon when compared to
other contemporaneous individuals from the region (Danielson and Reinhard 1998).
Moreover, poor oral health is equally documented in these comparative groups and
suggests the current individual is not unlike other previously analyzed prehistoric
Native American individuals from west Texas (Sobolik 1991).
Taphonomic Assessment
Taphonomic analysis is an approach utilized to understand the processes
that affect an organism after death (Behrensmeyer 1978; Haglund and Sorg 1997).
Most elements are stained light to medium brown in color with the exception of
a few elements of the left arm that show color and structural changes indicative
of burned dry bone. Moreover, the skeletal remains are highly fragmentary, likely
the result of multifactorial processes acting on the osseous tissues including

134

National Register Testing, Seven Sites at Eagle Pass Mine
physical and chemical weathering. The shallow burial depth (ca. 10 cm) and the
documented erosion at the site most likely exacerbated skeletal decomposition. There
is no evidence of rodent gnawing or scavenging of the remains, thus suggesting a
purposeful burial event as opposed to exposure on the surface.
There is differential staining on the left arm and forearm only. Here, the
midshaft left humerus is brown to black with soot adhering to the cortex of the
bone (Figure B.5). Secondly, the distal left humerus including the trochlea is white
and shows evidence of calcination (see Figure B.5). The color change and fracture
patterns of the burned bones suggest that a fire occurred postmortem on dry bone,
with the heat source closer to the distal humerus and spreading superiorly (Schmidt
and Symes 2015). No other skeletal fragments show evidence of burning. The lack
of evidence on the whole skeleton with a focal point on the left arm suggests the
burning event was secondary to the burial and most likely occurred as a result of
a natural or artificial event after skeletonization occurred.

APPENDIX B: Analysis of Human Skeletal Remains from 41MV189
SUMMARY OF SKELETAL ANALYSIS
The human skeletal remains associated with Feature 1 at 41MV189 are
consistent with previously published analyses of human skeletal remains from
west Texas. The skeletal remains represent an adult, possibly female, with poor
oral health as a result of an abrasive diet. The remains are in poor condition as a
result of a multitude of factors stemming from fluvial and aeolian processes acting
near the surface of the shallow burial. Moreover, there is evidence of secondary
burning that is most likely the result of an unrelated natural or artificial fire event
interacting with skeletonized human remains.
