Calendar of Activities

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT
First of all, I would like thank the dozen or
so TCAS members who worked at the Upper
Sprague site on Saturday, May 19th. Once
again, Mrs. Nature treated us with excellent
weather and digging conditions; but I wish she
could just do something about her fire ants.
We spent some of the day shooting in some
more permanent local datum points in each of
Areas A through D. This will speed up the
opening, recording and mapping of any more
units that we will be opening in the future.
Work is progressing out there very well, but as
usual we could always use a few more volunteers.
As I write this, Carol Macaulay is supervising and hosting about 9-10 of
her students from Baylor on the excavation, recording and lab work of an
archeological site at Area D of the Upper Sprague site. From what we
saw on the 19th, the students are learning fast and doing some extremely nice excavation work. They have set up camp by Frank Sprague’s cabin and will be working Monday through Friday there for about
three weeks; having their own mini Field School.
Speaking of Field School; TAS is hosting theirs from June 8th -16th at the
Presidio de San Saba in Menard once again this year. On behalf of everyone that I know who going this year, I can say that that the excitement
and expectations are high for this one. Personally, I like to see all of the
good old friends made from past Field Schools and expect to make
some new ones again this year. Without a doubt, FS couldn’t be at a
better place than Menard; good camping, a cool shady river, a landmark
archeological site within walking distance of camp, and the best local
people you will ever meet are all waiting for us to arrive. I hope to see a
lot of TCAS members there this year.

FROM JESSE TODD
I would like to thank Jim Blanton for his help with the Grapevine
Springs Park metal detecting project. We surveyed the whole
park and found some interesting places to excavate in October.
Jim acted not only as a field crew chief but as an archaeological
guide. His help enabled us to survey the whole park, and I didn't
have to run from one crew to the next.

WELCOME!

FIELD SCHOOL 2007

DON’T MISS OUT ON THE TEXAS ARCHEOLOGY
EVENT OF THE YEAR
ADAPTED FROM TXARCH.ORG
Every year the Texas Archeological Society sponsors an archeological excavation to provide training in disciplined archeological techniques. The field school is designed to last
eight days and each year is located in different areas of the state. People young and old
attend the annual event and take advantage of the many activities and learning opportunities available.
Every year a small city of tents and tent trailers as well as RVs arrive at a location established as the base camp for the week. Some choose not to camp and stay in local motels.
The main focus for the week is to participate in an archeological excavation led by trained
professionals. Participants may choose to work on-site in an active excavation to learn
proper procedures and documentation. Others choose to go on survey to learn how to
locate and record historical and pre-historical sites. Still others prefer the less strenuous
activities of cleaning and recording artifacts in the laboratory. The workday is from 7:00
A.M to 1:00 P.M. When lunchtime rolls around the workday is through but the scheduled
activities continue.
For those teachers who are looking for professional development opportunities, Field
School includes three days of teacher training (June 9-11). Teachers spend the mornings
in the field and two hours in the afternoon learning how to use archeology to teach math,
science, history, or social studies. Materials, including TEKS correlated lesson plans, are
provided..
Some participants enjoy afternoon activities offered in the local area, participate in educational workshops and programs or just socialize with friends. Others use the afternoon
and evenings as free time or a chance to hit the ever-popular Field School Showers. Programs aimed at instructional topics such as flint knapping, or making pottery are scheduled after the evening meal. These are followed each evening by programs that focus on
the archeology, history of the area, or topics of local interest to the membership. And, if
you haven’t attend a past field school, be sure to ask someone about the yearly Wally
Party; an event not to be missed.
The Annual TAS Field School is truly a family affair. In addition to adult programs an active
youth program is available which gives the kids opportunities for hands-on, in-the-dirt activities.
The Society provides a kitchen trailer and cooks to prepare the breakfast and evening
meals for those who want to avoid the hassle of cooking. For more information be sure
and browse the Texas Archeological Society website (txarch.org) for selections on Past
Field Schools and Kids Field School.
Registration for the summer field school is still open online. Along with signup for meals
and tee shirt purchases you will receive instructions on equipment to bring and additional
information. You may also contact the TAS Office or the Field School Chairman online with
specific questions or ask any of the Tarrant County Archaeological Society folks for more
information.

A PERFECT DAY FOR A DIG

FOR THE SECOND TIME IN AS MANY OUTINGS MOTHER NATURE SMILED ON US AS WE
GATHERED AT THE SPRAGUE SITE FOR A DAY OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND FRIENDSHIP.

We were greeted at the site with temperatures in the low 70s, wispy clouds, and a gentle breeze;
far different from past excursions with temperatures in the upper 90s and sticky clay soil to push
through the screens.
We arrived to find a newly designated “Area D,” which was opened the previous week by a contingent of Carol Macaulay’s students from Baylor. We are all familiar with Murphy’s Laws of Archaeology including the law that states, “the newest diggers will find the most artifacts.” Area D proved
no exception as the group of nine or ten students uncovered a mussel midden, a possible hearth,
and a large bison rib fragment. Hopefully Carol will share more Area D stories with us at Field
School.
Our crew of mostly seasoned excavators
spent the early part of the day reestablishing elevations in each of the four areas A
through D. With these elevations spread
over quite a large area we were able to
pinpoint objectives for the day regarding
possible numbers of occupations and expected occupation/sterile levels to look for.
The larger view allowed us to see that occupations may be evident with little sterile
area between them and that our usual ten
centimeter levels may lead to us not noticing occupation changes until we had gone
through them. We changed to a five centimeter level plan for the day with, seemingly, good results.
AREA D EXCAVATED BY STUDENTS FROM BAYLOR: A MUSSEL SHELL MIDFor those unfamiliar with the Sprague site DEN IN THE FOREGROUND, POSSIBLE HEARTH FEATURE AT THE TOP
RIGHT, AND BISON RIB NEXT TO THE BUCKET AT THE TOP
it is Toyah Phase (1300-1650ad). TCAS
has been excavating at the site for the
past three years. The site is on the banks of a river with evidence of occupation coming out of adjacent cut banks. The soil is mostly clay which makes excavation and screening difficult because of
too wet or too dry conditions. The predominance of artifacts collected so far are in the nature of
mussel shell, a variety of bone, and a few lithics and tools. A variety of features including large
mussel middens and hearths have been unearthed. Of special interest is the discovery of a Scallorn
point at the site. This point, associated with Archaic or Transitional sites, adds more questions to
the time periods of occupation at the Sprague site.

PLAN TO JOIN TCAS FOR FUTURE EXCAVATIONS AT THE SPRAGUE
SITE AND OTHER SITES THROUGHOUT NORTH CENTRAL TEXAS

ROCK ART RECORDING
PAINTED CANYON JULY 14-21, 2007
Join us for a spectacular trip back in time as we explore and record rock art
from this ancient site in the Lower Pecos region of Texas.
This site is an unusual site for the Lower Pecos Style Rock Art. This site has all three types of rock art styles of the Lower Pecos Rock Art: Lower Pecos Style, Red Monochrome, and the Red Linear Style.
This site will be fun to record. We know that it is in the hottest part of the summer for the Lower Pecos area but this site has a
very inviting pool of water in front of a portion of the canyon walls. The overhang of the canyon walls will provide shade most of
the day, so we will not suffer too much from the hot sun. There are also remnants of walls of a small rock building on the
site. We will place a large tarp over these walls which will provide additional shade from the sun and an area to store our supplies and ice coolers during the day.
We have been offered a very wonderful camping area for the week. There will be bathrooms with showers and we have the
privilege of the use of a kitchen which we will use for preparing and cooking our meals. Everyone will be charged a fee for the
food and the camping spaces ($40.00 per unit).
The daily menu will be:
Breakfast
cereal, bread, fruit juices, and fruit
Luncheon
sandwiches, chips, etc.
Dinner
A main dish with salad, bread, and dessert
You will provide your own special drinks (sodas) or whatever. There will be plenty of bottled water on hand.
We are also making arrangements for a tour of Rattlesnake Canyon for sometime during the week with Dr. Grant Hall as tour
guide.
We look forward to seeing you at Painted Canyon.
