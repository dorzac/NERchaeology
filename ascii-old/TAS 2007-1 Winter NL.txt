A Perfect Fit
Meet Carolyn Spock, 2007 TAS President
Folks, I was born to be involved with archeology and
archiving. That is, I love old things, and I can’t seem to
throw anything away. . .
I’ve led a very settled life. I was born and raised in Fort
Worth (Lake Worth, actually), 18 years in the same home,
with parents who stayed at the same jobs for pretty much as
long as I can remember. Twelve of those 18 years were in the
Fort Worth school system: 6 years at Denver Avenue Elementary School, 3 years at J. P. Elder Junior High School, 3 years
at North Side High School. I have two younger brothers who
followed suit (one of whom followed me as valedictorian).
As a young person, I was fascinated with archeological
articles in the National Geographic Magazine and stops at
archeological sites on family vacations. Nonetheless, I fixated on rocks, rather than artifacts, when scoping out things
on the ground and I still have some pretty stones from vacations and fossils from our gravel driveway.
I left Fort Worth for two years of at Cottey College, a
private woman’s school in Nevada, Missouri. An interesting
experience, especially as it was my first lengthy time away
from home. A downside to schooling there, other than the
obvious dearth of male students, was that no anthropology
courses were taught. I toyed with various majors, morphing
through three of them in my two years there.
In the fall of 1966 I came to Austin to complete my
B.A. I immediately began to make up for my lack of
anthropology classes by immersing myself in multiple
courses each semester, and making my last change of
majors into anthropology. I joined the UT Anthropological Society, went on a few digs, came to meetings, hanging out with the likes of Tom Hester, Al Wesolowsky,
John Clark, Frank Weir, Gentry Steele, Tom Ellzey,
Lorraine Heartfield, and David Ing—though I was certainly on the periphery of the group.
In 1968 I did get my B A. in Anthropology, then being
at odds and ends, headed off to California for a year as a

New TAS President, Carolyn Spock, at her work at TARL.

VISTA volunteer. Returning to Austin in late 1969, I took
the advice of Al W. to check on getting into grad school at
UT. That was just the thing to do, and I entered grad school
as an Anthropology major, my first outing being a field
school under Dr. Dee Ann Story at the George C. Davis site
in the summer of 1970. Being sort of a foot-dragger and
professional procrastinator, I didn’t manage to get my M.A.
until 1977. But, in a most fortunate turn of circumstances,
the summer of 1970 began my association with the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory at UT-Austin, which has
truly been home to me for 35+ years. I certainly enjoy my
spot as Head/Curator of Records at TARL and the contact it
has given me with people around the state.

A Perfect Fit
Continued from front page

The Texas Archeological Society hit my radar when I
was tapped to help host a Board meeting held at Balcones
Research Center. I remember thinking that this gathering
must be for only a certain few and trying to keep myself busy
out of earshot. Let me assure you all that this is not, and was
not, the case (but I never asked). In the years since I joined
the Society, I have attended many a Board meeting as a
visitor, more than a few as a committee member or chair, or
in recent years, as an officer. I’ve been a member of the
Council of Texas Archeologists since its (re)formation in
1977, being a perpetual member on whatever incarnation the
curation committee assumed, and serving as CTA SecretaryTreasurer at some point in the ensuing years. Locally, I have
been a member of the Travis County Archeological Society,
initially (ca. 1980) as a TARL representative to TCAS, and
later as a full-fledged member and officer. I tried to calculate
the years I have served as TCAS president, and gave up,
though it looks collectively as if it would be around ten
terms. Not that I’m complaining about any of my society
involvements. Most especially, the folks I have met have
befriended me, counseled me, worked with me, befuddled
me—they are what makes life interesting!
To steal from my October letter to the Board, there are
some things which I hope the Society can tackle this year. We
are still facing deficit spending, as the membership fee adjustment this past year was adopted knowing it was only a stopgap
measure. Our Budget Committee will be looking over expenses and income and working with the Executive Committee and Board to find a more permanent solution. I have asked
our committees and officers to step up their efforts at commu-

nicating—with each other, with other officers, committees,
regional directors, with the main Society office, and with the
public. We want our activities advertised and reflected in the
newsletter and on our website, especially where local/regional
societies aren’t there to take up the slack.
I have also asked the Board to get back on track devising
a handbook for their respective successors. Field School,
Annual Meeting, and Academy committees have produced
manuals to date—though I may have overlooked others—
and all such documents need regular updating. Our volunteer
Board (committees et al.) is constantly changing, and a template for newcomers to follow would make things run more
smoothly and help us avoid reinventing the wheel. Indeed,
while working on the handbooks, I would encourage a careful scrutiny of the way things are done and see if a shift in
direction is in order. Though the science we practice deals
with seemingly incremental changes over big chunks of time,
the world of today noticeably changes ever so rapidly.
All of the officers, committee members, directors, representatives, staff—and members—are important to the functioning of the TAS. I would like us to have a splendid year
working together for the benefit of the Society, educating the
public and each other while exploring and preserving the
past in which we have such an interest. I look forward to
working with all of you this year and in the future. Each of
you brings a unique point of view to the Society; you make
TAS the exceptional group that it is. That’s why, when I go
to a Board meeting or a larger TAS function, I can tell my
family and co-workers that I’m leaving to visit and work
with a few dozen (or a few hundred) of my best friends.

Society for American Archeology
Austin, April 25-30
The Austin Convention Center will be alive with exhibits, papers and posters—over 2,000 submissions were received for the program. The opening session on Wednesday
evening will be “Borders, Boundaries and Bridges in Texas
Archeology.” The President’s Forum will focus on the Peopling of the Americas. The Education Committee has organized ArcheologyLand featuring hands-on activities for
Saturday and “Taking the Camino Real to School” among
other sessions. TAS and CTA will sponsor a booth in the
exhibits room. The American Rock Research Association
will host a symposium and booth.

This conference is one you will want to attend so that you
can hear the latest in archeological theory and practice.See the
Society for American Archaeology web site www.saa.org to
learn more about the conference and to register.
You may volunteer to assist with meeting logistics without being a member. In return for 12 hours of your time (3 four
hour shifts), you will receive meeting registration, a copy of
Abstracts and $5 stipend per shift. Applications are being
accepted through Feb.1 on a first-come, first-serve basis. For
more details and application, go to www.saa.org or contact

Were You There?
The TAS Annual Meeting in the western metropolis of
San Angelo was a great example of the camaraderie that
exists within the organization. In spite of cranky elevators
and a bar whose doors were locked the entire time, this
annual meeting was wonderful! The Concho Valley Archeological Society is to be congratulated on a job well done.
Golden Pen Award recipient Alice Stultz organized and
directed a very fine Silent Auction. Registrar Brownie Roberts and her able assistants managed the registration desk
with flair and answered a multitude of questions. There were
60 papers presented to over 318 attendees who ventured to
San Angelo from all areas of the state and beyond. The
humorous Doug Boyd gave the interesting program on Tales
of the Dead, Archeology of Forgotten Historic Cemeteries,
to a full house at the Friday night forum. After the forum, the
Careers in Archeology social ran in to the wee hours of the
night. It was well attended by many of our younger members
as well as all interested persons.
There were 213 paid attendees at the Saturday evening
Banquet. Awards Committee representative Alan Skinner,
along with the Clute sisters, presented awards to the following outstanding members: Bryan Jameson received the

and tear on their vehicles by moving the Field School trailers
from Menard to Paris and back to Menard to support the
2005 and 2006 Field Schools, President Glynn Osburn presented three Presidential Awards. The Texas Archeological
Society is blessed to have volunteers such as Claude
Hudspeth, Frank Sprague, and Jack Pool who are willing to
undertake such difficult and time-consuming tasks.
This year the C.K. Chandler Award was presented to
David Calame for recording the most sites. Congratulations
to these individuals for their many contributions to TAS.
The happy crowd was delighted to hear famous western
author Elmer Kelton’s talk. Mr. Kelton held us captivated
for almost a hour with his story of how he started writing
western novels and the analogy of how his work in writing
historical novels was so similar to that of archeology in that
we are both digging into the past for information.

resources before leading a group tour at Paint Rock.

Winter 2007

On a beautiful, sunny Sunday morning, over 100 lucky
attendees took the fascinating tour of the Painted Rocks at
the Campbell Ranch located near Paint Rock. Kay Campbell
and Fred Campbell personally guided the groups, all the
while telling stories and tales about the painted rocks. Another 20 or so members took an especially arranged tour of
historic Ft. Concho in downtown San Angelo.
The gross revenues were a little over $22,000 and the
net profit was some $13,300.00 plus the revenue from the
Silent Auction. Thank you CVAS for a wonderful weekend!

2006 TAS Award Presentations
The Award Committee of Linda Ott, Art Tawater, and
Alan Skinner had a fun but also solemn job, and in doing our
job, we had the pleasure of reviewing nomination letters.
This year we did not receive nominations for Fellow or for
the Biface historic preservation award. All of us hope we
will have multiple nominations to ponder over next summer.

Francis Stickney Field School Award
The first honoree is for the Francis Stickney Field School
Award. If any TAS member can be considered the Wizard of
Field School, it must be the recipient. This man does it all
quietly, efficiently, and with uncanny tact, so that very few

Bryan Jameson
people are even aware of his contributions and talents. This
condition of quiet-efficient- tact is highlighted in a Rod
Stewart song that goes “I’ve got lightning in my veins. . .”
The recipient joined TAS in 1987 and was immediately
attracted to the aims of archeology and the camaraderie of the
organization. His first Field School was Devil’s River, where
he began to master archeological techniques and got to know
many fellow members. A few short years later he was camp
boss at the two Red River Field Schools, where he agonized
over possible electrocution of attendees from flooding at the
camp site, all the while raising morale by helping to float
plastic ducks on “Lake Idabel.” Of those field schools, one
former president has noted that whenever something was
needed, anything was needed, all she had to do was ask him
and it appeared as if by magic. At the Del Rio Field School he

handled many logistics and photographed sites for the Amistad
National Recreation Area data base. From that point on he has
assumed more and more responsibility at field schools.
In 1999 he was appointed to the Field School Committee
and in 2002 was its chair. In that year, he was called upon to
create a miracle by quickly locating a new site (Melton site)
for field school, finding a Principal Investigator, clearing
land, and putting into play all the logistics necessary to pull
off a successful field school.
He has stated that the field school at Espiritu Santu was
his most enjoyable. Serving as a site supervisor, his untiring
work ethic and impeccable notes made while excavating a
lime kiln gained the respect and a generous note of thanks
from Dr. Tom Hester, the PI. We can only hope that the crew
members appreciated the long hours in high humidity in
which he encouraged them to complete the job. Maybe he
substituted caffeinated coffee for decaf as has been rumored
that he had done at previous schools.
For him, field school isn’t just about the numbers of
porta-potties needed and various shower configurations; it is
also about number crunching. Field Schools require income
and outlay of monies, all of which must be written up in
detailed financial reports. This too is his responsibility as
chair of the FS Committee.
And then there are the crew assignments, or as sometimes known as the nightmare job from hell. For many years
the daunting task of placing field school participants on site
crews has fallen to him. Just imagine what a combination of
an Excel spread sheet and his own software, all color coded
looks like. He must juggle newcomers with experienced
members with men who can carry buckets with diligent
diggers with “three-dayers” and “seven dayers,” all in the
context of compatibility. Fortunately, delicate negotiations
are also his forte. The Field School Wizard thus takes on the
role of chief problem-solver in a tribal meeting.
Even though he is employed full-time at Lockheed Martin, he still finds time to volunteer as a very active member of
the Tarrant County Archeological Society and the Texas Archeological Stewardship Network. Soon after joining TCAS
(the one in Fort Worth), he became one of its Vice-Presidents.
From 1990 to 1996 he served as President and has been a
Vice-President in charge of projects or programs ever since.
As a Steward since 1996, he has assisted several THC
archeologists in regional projects. He has taught children and
adults about archeology at various fairs and educational

Continued from page 9

projects. In addition he has designed and built archeological
displays in several Texas counties.
In conclusion, he has contributed to every facet of TAS
Field School and Texas avocational archeology. His can-do
attitude, attention to detail, and enormous personal commitment render him a deserving nominee for the Francis Stickney
Field School Award. We honor Bryan Jameson for his outstanding work on the Field School Committee.

The Second Award is the Golden
Pen Award
This recipient has been actively involved in community
service for many years, and has held key offices in the many
organizations where she has tirelessly given her time. More
recent recognitions include being recognized as Concho Valley Association of the Blind Board Member of the Year in
1997. She was recognized among San Angelo Business and
Professional Women Award of 1998 as a “Woman to Watch”.
She has been a member of TAS since 1978 and has
served on the TAS Board as Regional Director and has served
on the Board for the TAS Rock Art Task Force Board. She has
been a member of the Concho Valley Archeological Society
since 1979, served as President and has presented numerous
programs. She has served as Archeological Steward for the
Texas Historical Commission since 1995.

Winter 2007

As an artist, she has had her art published in American
Girl magazine and others, and she has exhibited her artwork in San Angelo at the Chicken Farm Art Center and
Gecko Gallery.
In serving as a Volunteer Steward under the Texas Archeological Stewardship Network, she documented excavations of CVAS at an archeological site in Concho County
known as “A Prehistoric and Early Settlers” Site (41CC328)
on the Upper Reaches of Brady Creek. Her most recent
publication is in the 2006 Transactions of the Southwest
Federation of Archeological Societies.The Golden Pen Award
was presented to Alice Stultz of San Angelo.

The Third Award is the Distinguished
Service Award
We often find ourselves explaining why we go to Field
School every year. Not everyone understands why we would
go to some desolate place to camp out and live out in the
elements, get up at 5:00 AM just for the opportunity to dig in

the Texas heat. They often conclude that there is some special
thrill to archeology that they just don’t understand, and there
is. But that doesn’t tell the whole story. It is the merriment and
companionship that really keeps most of us coming back.
The recipient has a lot to do with the fun atmosphere at
the field school. Officially, she has served on the Field School
Committee for several years. Unofficially she has been our
mistress of ceremonies; I am sure that there is a more technical anthropological term for that individual in a group who
creates and maintains the ceremonies. The person who tends
the social bonds. What ever you call this role, she fills it for
us at the Field School.
Armed with only a hair-brained committee, paper plates
and flagging tape, every year she manages the Friday night
awards program. No field school would be complete without
a trip to the Dollar Store and at least one dumpster diving
expedition. The rest of us pack trowels and shower shoes:
she never travels without a gorilla suit. She organizes all
kinds of social functions, arranges evening programs and is
also an ambassador to the local community.

She has many talents but two special gifts stand out. She
has a special gift for merriment. She woke us with the cow
car at 5:00 AM. She introduced us to the Clute Sisters. She
helps us find a wide variety of body parts at the evacuation
sites. She always has some gadget or scheme to get the
laughter started. But her greatest gift is her leadership.
Who else could have convinced someone to wear a
gorilla suit in the June heat or to stage a group of campers as
female backup singers in duck suits. TAS Presidents and
Principal Investigators take orders from her and don cow
suits and rabbit suits, and grown men become contestants in
the “Miss Silver Mine Competition” at her request.
At Field school, most of us get past the heat, the aches
and pains, the mosquitoes, the rainstorms, the lack of artifacts, and the cold showers, by focusing on the fun.
The recipient keeps smiles on our faces and our memories filled with chuckles. Because of her unique contribution,
Andie Comini has been chosen to receive the TAS Distinguished Service award.

Student Scholarship Fund Well Received
In 2006, TAS members donated enough money to the
Student Scholarship Fund to send four college students to the
TAS Field School in Paris, and two students to the Annual
Meeting in San Angelo. Thank you to everyone who has already contributed to the scholarship fund. Since these scholarships are completely funded by donations, please consider
contributing to the TAS Student Scholarship Fund to help send
students to field school or annual meeting. Donations can be
mailed to the TAS business office or you can donate by credit
card online at http://www.txarch.org/credit/TASdonate.htm by
placing the amount in the “Other Donation” box and listing
student scholarship in the comments section.
TAS student scholarships are designed to cover the
basic costs of attending each event and include student membership in TAS, registration fees, and expenses associated
with each event. For more information or questions about the
TAS student scholarships, contact Christine Gauger, TAS
Scholarship Committee Chair at cmgauger@hotmail.com.
Below are comments from the two Annual Meeting
Scholarship recipients.
Carly Whelan wrote: “Attending the Texas Archeological
Society annual meeting was an incredibly rewarding experience
for me. I especially enjoyed the Careers in Archaeology informational session, because it allowed me to introduce myself to
prospective employers, learn what kinds of things they are
looking for in prospective employees, and find out what kinds
of positions are available. I also enjoyed the student poster
sessions, because they allowed me to see which avenues of

research other students are pursuing and better prepare myself
for my own poster presentation at next year’s Society for American Archaeology annual meeting. I am very grateful to the TAS
board for providing a scholarship which gives the opportunity
to attend the TAS annual meeting to undergraduate students
who would not otherwise be able to. It is important for undergraduate students who plan on pursuing archaeology in graduate school to have the experience of attending conferences at
both the state and national level, so that they can better understand how the professional world of archaeology works and
learn what they can do to better prepare themselves for it. I hope
that the TAS scholarship program will be able to expand in the
coming years in order to give even more students the enriching
opportunity that it provided for me.”
Rachel Menegaz wrote: “I look forward to all TAS events
and especially the Annual Meeting. While the TAS Field School
is method-intensive, the Annual Meeting is a fantastic way to
experience the broad results of Texas archeology in a compact
period of time. This meeting is a great stepping-stone for students into the field; particularly with the recent addition of
Friday night’s CTA-TAS career social, it is also an excellent
networking tool. As I experienced, the convivial atmosphere of
the Annual Meeting is ideal for a student’s first podium or
poster presentation. I am deeply grateful to TAS for providing
me and other students with the means to attend the Annual
Meeting; in my opinion, meetings are not only highly instructional but also crucial to one’s personal progress in the field. I
look forward to seeing everyone in San Antonio next year!”

David Calame Wins the C.K. Chandler Award
Jonathan H. Jarvis, TARL
David Calame, Sr. was the recipient of the inaugural
C.K. Chandler Award at the Annual Meeting in San
Angelo. Named in honor of C.K. Chandler, a prodigious
site recorder, the award recognizes member’s efforts to
document our irreplaceable and often endangered archeological sites. David documented an astounding total of 55
sites during the period of 1 September 2005 through 31
August 2006. Through his tireless site recording efforts,
David has made a significant contribution to our knowledge of the archeological record.
David could use some competition, so start recording
sites today to be eligible for next year’s award. A brief
summary of the requirements:
• The recipient must be a TAS member in good
standing.

• Site documentation must be submitted to TARL
for an official trinomial. Documentation should
minimally include a completed electronic TexSite
form (don’t forget to include the landowner
information) and a site location plotting on a
1:24,000 USGS topographic quadrangle base map.
• The sites recorded cannot be part of a funded
project.
• The award covers the period from 1 September
through 31 August of the following year.
Please do not hesitate to contact me at jjarvis@mail.

Institution will be our banquet speaker. Owsley investigates both ancient and modern human bones including
those from Jamestown, the Civil War Confederate submarine CSS Hunley, and Kennewick Man.
Other events already in the planning stages include
business meetings, committee meetings, banquet and banquet speaker, favorites such as masquerade ball, book
room, workshops, artifact identifications and silent auction. The silent action promises to have something for
everyone. TAS and STAA folks have already started collecting donations so clean out those closets, visit those
estate sales, purge your library of duplicate copies and put
your talent to work to make that special item. The meeting offers the opportunity to socialize with old friends,
meet new ones, hear talks on the latest research and investigations, and share our interest in the cultural heritage of
Texas with the public.

Academies 2007
Three sessions of the Texas Archeology Academy
will be sponsored by TAS in 2007. No experience or
previous knowledge is needed to learn and enjoy these
weekend sessions.

ancient lifeways. Dr. Shafer will lead the workshop with
the assistance of Marybeth Tomka. Special attention will
be paid to Caddoan Pottery with Caddoan Potter Jerry
Redcorn. The Ceramics Academy will be held in
Nacogdoches March 3-4 at Liberty Hall.

Lithics: Reading Stone Artifacts
The Lithics workshop is designed to provide hands-on
experience for recognizing and analyzing stone artifacts.
You will learn the different ways in which stone tools were
made, how to recognize their different use-wear patterns
and the interpretation of stone artifacts found in the archeological record. Flintknapping demonstrations will focus not
so much on how points are made but rather how the archeological record is formed. Dr. Harry Shafer will lead the
workshop with the assistance of Dr. John Dockall and
flintknapping specialists. The Lithic Academy will be held
Feb.3-4 in San Antonio at CAR at UTSA.

Ceramics: The Stories Found in Pottery
In this workshop you will learn how pottery is made
and used, how pottery reflects cultural traditions, and
how archeologists use the ceramic data to understand the
people and their past life-ways. Participants will learn to
recognize and sort sherds to answer questions about

TAS Rock Art Academy attendees visit White Shaman
Preserve; Carolyn Boyd speaking.

Rock Art
This Academy will explore Texas rock art within a
world framework. Presentations will include rock art as
part of cultural expression, rock art and territorial geography, sacred canyons, and why recording rock art is important. Dr. Harry Shafer and Dr. Carolyn Boyd will lead the
workshop. Participants will be in class and visiting rock
art sites—White Shaman on the Pecos River and Fate Bell
in Seminole Canyon. Participants should be in good physical health (able to climb 10 flights of stairs) to visit the
sites. Classes will be held at the Shumla School near
Comstock. Limited accommodations are available at
Shumla, Seminole Canyon State Park or Del Rio. Participants will be informed of options. Rock Art Academy
will be held March 30–April 1(beginning Friday evening).

Open to All
All workshops are intended for anyone interested in
archeological topics. Avocational archeologists experience new dimensions of expertise; professional archeologists benefit from review; undergraduates, graduate
students and educators may receive credit for the classes.
The goal of Texas Archeology Academy is to show how
archeology is done and why we do it.

We’re Back!
The 2007 TAS Field School at Presidio San Saba
Tamra Walter

I am extremely excited to invite all of you back to
Menard for the upcoming TAS field school in 2007. This
summer’s field school will be particularly significant because it coincides with the 250th anniversary of the founding
of the presidio. The Menard community as always has been
welcoming and extremely supportive of both the TAS and
Texas Tech field schools and is looking forward to our arrival in June. As in 2003 and 2004, the Stockpen Crossing
County Park will serve as our campground and base of operations. In addition, trailer hook-ups are available in both
the county park and at the Baptist Encampment located immediately to the west of the park. Our camp is centrally
located and is close to a grocery store, banks, a pharmacy,
minor emergency clinic, churches and a number of great
restaurants (the Side Oats Café being one of my favorites!).
The campground is across the river from the presidio and
campers will be able to walk to the site via a bridge over the
San Sabá River. The site can also be reached by car from
Hwy. 83 over the river bridge and then west on Hwy 190.
The site of Presidio San Sabá was first established in
1757 in conjunction with Mission San Sabá. The founding of
a mission and fort in the area was prompted by Spanish
efforts to Christianize the Lipan Apache. Ultimately, however their efforts failed and the mission was abandoned a
short 10 months after it was established. In March of 1758
the mission was attacked and destroyed by several allied
tribes that were united in their dislike of the Apache and
angered by the alliance between the Spanish and the Lipan.
Despite the end of the missionary effort at San Sabá, the
presidio remained open for another 12 years. Although its
primary purpose when first founded was to protect the mission, the fort also served as buffer against Indian raids that
were being carried out in San Antonio. Thus the fort continued to operate until it was abandoned in 1770. During the
time that the Spanish occupied the presidio, however, some
100 soldiers and their families as well as civilians (roughly
200-400 additional people) were frequently confined to the
compound due to native hostilities towards the Spanish and
the threat of attack. Initially the presidio was constructed of
wattle and daub buildings. After the attack on the mission
however, the fort was rebuilt using stone. This stone presidio
represents the largest Spanish fort in Texas. Little remains of
the original stone construction today since large portions of

school in Menard.

the presidio were dismantled in the 1880s when the town of
Menard was established. Stone from the fort was quarried to
provide building materials for new construction in town. In
1936 efforts to reconstruct the northwest portion of the
presidio were underway and today the standing ruins that
mark the site are remnants of this reconstruction.
Archaeological investigations at the site began in 2000
and have continued to the present. In addition to the two
TAS field schools held at Presidio San Sabá, Texas Tech
University has completed six field schools at the site. These
investigations have focused on recovering information about
the original architecture of the fort (both the wattle and daub
construction and the stone construction), the layout and purpose of the buildings, and daily life of the residents. As a
result of the excavations carried out at the site by both the
TAS and Texas Tech we have exposed evidence for the
original wooden fort, we have uncovered features in the
interior compound that provide hints about daily activities
and the layout of the fort (e.g, trash pits and cobble pavements), and we are also uncovering stone architecture that
was not documented in either of the 1767 maps of the presidio
produced during a military inspection tour of the frontier.
For example, neither of the maps shows rooms along the
southern wall of the fort however we have clear evidence

that rooms were present here. Changes to the fort may have
been made after 1767 in response to the poor review that San
Sabá received as a result of this inspection. Since the community of Menard would like to eventually reconstruct the
fort as accurately as possible delineating original architecture and understanding the changes that were made to the
fort over time is a primary goal of our research. In addition
we would like to pinpoint where certain activities took place
such as blacksmithing or cooking as well as the location of
the cemetery, wells, and privies. Many of these questions
remain unanswered and we are hoping to address them during this coming field season.
One area of interest that we will be focusing on in 2007
is the southeast bastion of the fort. Last year’s Texas Tech
field school confirmed that large portions of the bastions are
still intact. Given that the two 18th century maps of the fort
have conflicting representations of the corner, further defining the architecture in this area will be a primary goal of our
investigations. Large excavations blocks will be opened here
in order to expose the rest of the corner that was not excavated in the summer of 2006. Furthermore, we will also be
opening additional units along the southern wall in order to
investigate that stone architecture first encountered at the
2003 TAS field school. Another area of interest is the northeastern corner where evidence for jacal-type structures and
cobblestone pavements was found. The cultural deposits at
the site are relatively shallow and the Spanish deposits are
typically encountered between 20-40 cm below the surface.
Therefore we anticipate being able to open a number of
excavation units during the week-long field session. Ideally,
the data we recover will contribute to a better understanding
of the fort’s architecture, how it functioned, and what life

Back at the Presidio in Menard
Field School 2007
Camp Boss, Jack Pool
This June will see the TAS Field School return for the
third time to the Presidio San Luis de Las Amarillas on the
beautiful banks of the San Saba River in Menard. The 2003
and 2004 Field Schools at this location were very popular
with the TAS membership and the archeological finds there
were extraordinary. The community of Menard has always
proven to be the most gracious of hosts by providing such a
fantastic camp and any assistance that was needed in addition to a hospitality tent on the Presidio premises! The wellshaded Stockpen’s Crossing Park will again be the official
campsite for the field school.
In addition to the listings below, The Baptist Encampment next door will have a few RV sites available at a rate of
$15.00 a night. The Baptist Encampment will also have air
conditioned dormitories for men and women. Each dorm
will sleep up to 120 people. The cost to stay in a dorm is
$7.00 a night and includes full bathroom facilities with hot
showers. They will also offer hot showers to TAS members
not staying with them for $2.50. The contact for the Baptist
Encampment is Baldemar Gonzales, and he may be reached
at 325-396-2162 or 325-396-4437.
We expect that this field school will be very popular
again this summer and encourage you to get reservations as
early as possible if you plan to take advantage of any of the
motels or campgrounds.

The Gilmore Endowment
A Gift that Keeps on Giving!
Dr. Kathleen Gilmore was right about that green
glazed pottery all along. When Ed Jelks and Curtis Tunnell
approached her in 1971 about analyzing some pottery and
artifacts from the Keeran Ranch near Victoria, Texas, she
was only too happy to oblige. She loved exploring historical sites, having written her master’s thesis on the San
Xavier Missions, and she felt that not enough research
was being done on the colonial period in Texas history.
The Keeran Ranch had long been reputed to be the
location of La Salle’s Fort St. Louis, the first European
colony in Texas, as well as of Presidio La Bahia, the Spanish occupation that succeeded it. Jelks and Tunnell asked
Gilmore to evaluate some recovered ceramics and to help
them to discern the site’s potential. She was curious about
the green glaze on the sherds, which appeared to be French
rather than Spanish. She had seen nothing like them in any
of her research on Spanish colonial sites and she sent a
sample to a Canadian colleague who concurred with her
opinion. In her initial report, Gilmore wrote that the site
was the “probable” location of Fort St. Louis. In a later
publication, however, she omitted the word “probable” and
her theory remained controversial for decades. Then, in
1998, La Salle’s eight iron cannon were discovered on the
ranch, confirming the French presence. She had always
been confident that the Keeran Ranch was the site they
were looking for and she now says she wishes she had not
used the word “probable” in her initial report.
In 2003 Gilmore created the Bob and Kathleen
Gilmore Endowment in Spanish and French Colonial Archeology in Texas through the Friends of the Texas Historical Commission. Her goal for the fund was twofold: to
honor the memory of her late husband and to underwrite
additional research on colonial sites in the Lone Star State.
“I hope that this fund will support both the analysis of
artifacts and archival research,” she says. “And I enjoy
getting to know the people who benefit from the grants
and to see the results of my investment in action.” Grants
from Gilmore’s endowment have sponsored several research projects, including archival research in France related to the La Salle Shipwreck Project, and a study on

Spanish missions by Mark Wolf, a San Antonio architect
who is descended from a soldier stationed at the ill-fated
Mission San Saba.
Gilmore says she would like to see more researchers
applying for grants from her endowment. The process is
simple: a two-page letter sent to Dr. James E. Bruseth,
Director of the Archeology Division at the Texas Historical Commission with an attached one-page budget. Dr.
Bruseth and Dr. Gilmore review the proposed project and
its costs, and decisions are made expeditiously. “I would
like to see more people benefit from this fund and to help
close some of the gaps in Texas’ colonial history,” she
says. “I also find it gratifying to know that my contributions will continue to support artifact analysis and archival research in perpetuity.”
For more information on the Gilmore Endowment or to
apply for a grant, contact Jim Bruseth at the Texas Historical
Commission, P.O. Box 12276, Austin, Texas 78711-2276,

From the Education Committee
Elliot Richmond, Education Committee Chair
TAS was represented at three statewide teacher
conferences this fall: The Texas Council for the Social Studies
(TCSS) in Fort Worth on October 13 and 14, 2006, the Conference for the Advancement of Science Teaching (CAST) in
Wichita Falls on November 9-11, and Texas Association for
Gifted and Talented (TAGT) in Austin on November 15-18.
At each conference, hundreds of booth visitors were handed a
book mark. Those that slowed momentarily were given additional information that may have included a membership brochure and the summer or fall newsletters. In each case,
substantial interest was shown by teachers in the Spring Academies and the Summer 2007 Field School. At the social studies conference, most of these teachers include Texas history in
their class loads, so the excavation and Presidio de San Saba
was of particular interest.
At TCSS, Bennett Kimbell and Elliot Richmond gave a
presentation on Teaching Social Studies with Texas Archeology to about 20 attendees. The presentation was well received
and teachers asked several questions and shared information

with each other. Interest was again shown in the Academies
and Field School. At CAST, Elliot gave a presentation on
Teaching Science with Texas Archeology. This was reasonably well attended, with around 20 teachers participating. At
TAGT, Kathleen Hughes and Elliot presented information on
how Texas archeology could interest gifted and talented students to around 12 or 15 attendees. Kathleen prepared a slide
show of the youth at Field school using materials she had
received from Doug Boyd. This was well received.
At TCSS, booth helpers were Bennett Kimbell, Glynn
Osburn, and Elliot Richmond. In Wichita Falls, the booth was
staffed by Elliot, Bill Stiver, and Twyla and Leah Tharp. At
the Gifted and talented conference, Elliot, Robin Matthews,
Ann Matthews, and Kathleen Hughes all spent time meeting
and greeting and talking about archeology. The total amount
of volunteer time for these three conferences, NOT including
driving time and preparing materials, was well over 150 hours.
We all had a great time presenting and meeting teachers and
talking about the thing we love, Texas archeology.

Touch the Past—Archaeology of the Upper Mississippi River Valley
This summer the Mississippi Valley Archaeology Center
at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse will be offering a
National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Institute
for School Teachers. The Institute will run from July 9
through 27, 2007 and will be held on the University of
Wisconsin-La Crosse campus, with field trips scheduled to
archaeological sites across the state. The Institute will provide
twenty-five K-12 teachers with three weeks of study of the
process of archaeology and the major cultures of the Upper
Mississippi Valley, including how these societies adapted
and evolved over the past 12,000 years.
Although the institute will be based in Wisconsin, teachers around the United States would greatly benefit from this
opportunity.Participants will explore the rich archaeological
record of the Upper Mississippi Valley and the indigenous
cultures as well as the process of archaeological discovery
and interpretation. Besides being a fascinating story, the
archaeological record of the Upper Mississippi Valley provides a laboratory within which to examine how we have
come to know what we do about the past, and how archaeologists move from potsherds and projectile points to insights into how people lived, adapted to their surroundings,
and changed through time. Participants will learn about the

20

✦

Winter 2007

nature of the archaeological record, including its strengths
and limitations, through exposure to actual archaeological
excavations and laboratory work, and discussion of how we
can infer information from cultural remains. Through authentic research experiences and inquiry-based projects,
teachers will learn to make relevant connections between indepth archaeological, anthropological, historical, literary, and
cultural content and their classroom teaching.
More information about the Institute and registration
can be found on-line at: http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/neh.htm.
The deadline for applications is March 1, 2007. For additional information please contact Bonnie Jancik at
janck.bonn@uwlax.edu
Rock Art Recording: March 11 through 17, 2007 The
recording will be on several of the ranches in the Panhandle
region. Contact Teddy Stickney, 201 West Solomon Ln,
Midland, Tx 79705 telephone 432-682- 9384 or email
stick711@sbcglobal.net, or Wendy Lockwood, 120 Colonial
Circle, Burleson, Tx 76028, telephone 817-295-0266 or email
wendy1247@yahoo.com. As we know Panhandle weather in
the spring may be unpredicitable, but with several different
sites to record we can move around to avoid being overwhelmed by the weather.

TAS a Valued Supporter of
The Archaeology Channel
by Richard M. Pettigrew, Ph.D., RPA, President and Executive Director
Archaeological Legacy Institute

The Oregon-based Archaeological Legacy Institute,
now in its eighth year of operation, is dedicated to pioneering new ways of gathering important information
about past human lifeways and delivering it to the public
and the profession. A fundamental postulate is that archaeology has important messages to deliver accurately
and completely to people worldwide about our origins
and development as a species, and that among these messages are those about mistakes humans have made in the
past and must not make in the future. We are keenly
aware that nearly half of the American public still believes that the human species was created within the past
10,000 years! Obviously, we as people dedicated to archaeology need to do a better job of sharing what we
know. Through our increasingly popular Web site, The
Archaeology Channel (http://www.archaeologychannel.org),
we are making significant progress in doing just that.
Through The Archaeology Channel (TAC), we are
able to share with the wider public the mind-altering values, experiences and insights derived from archaeological
research. After more than six years of very hard work
with little financial backing, ALI has succeeded in making TAC the world’s most popular archaeology-related
Web site. As a non-profit, Member-supported organization, we at ALI are deeply grateful to our Individual and
Organizational Members for helping to make this possible. Without the continued support of groups like the
Texas Archeological Society–a loyal ALI Organizational
Member for the past five years–informational resources
like TAC would simply not exist.
Attracted to our on-demand streaming media video
and audio programs, our Web audience has grown substantially, especially over the past two-and-one-half years.
Our traffic for 2005 reached 2.7 million sessions and 5.4
million page views. In 2006, we project about 3.6 million
sessions and 6.5 million page views, an increase of about
30%. Our visitors, now amounting to nearly 300,000 each

22

✦

Winter 2007

month, come largely from the US, but also include people
from more than 150 other countries. Beginning in July
2005, we began to podcast our radio-style Audio News
from Archaeologica, summarizing each week’s worldwide archaeology news, and by May 2006 we had a
monthly Audio News audience of 193,000 visitors. We
are fast approaching 100 videos and nearly as many audio
programs available in our on-demand program list, covering archaeological and indigenous topics from around the
world. A Google search using the keyword “archaeology”
typically lists TAC in the top ten of over 27 million
topically-related Web sites. We’ve come a long way since
we introduced our first streaming video in 2000!
Currently, we live a hand-to-mouth existence, always
just making ends meet month by month. That means that
our ability to sustain our current level of activity and to
grow is severely held in check by very limited funding.
Our business model is similar to public broadcasting,
which means we depend on sustaining memberships, both
Individual and Organizational, as well as underwriting,
grants and sales of videos and other merchandise. This
message to you, the Board, members and affiliates of
TAS, is part of our continuing effort to convince
avocational and professional archaeological groups around
the country to help ensure the success of TAC and our
many other projects by chipping in a modest amount each
year. To support ALI and The Archaeology Channel, go
to our Become a Member page, at http://www.archaeology
channel.org/member.asp. To renew an Organizational
Membership with ALI, go to our Renewing Your TAC
Membership page, at http://www.archaeologychannel.org/
membernew.html, or contact us directly, at 541-345-5538.
If we are successful in convincing one avocational
society in each state to contribute in this way, we will
expand our annual income by $12,500. This amount, or
even something less than that, would hugely enhance our
ability to develop and deliver programming. We would be

able to expand the work accomplished by paid staff, upgrade equipment, pay the increasing hosting costs of
webcasting to a growing audience, and invest more time
and effort in productive fund-raising through our Underwriting Program. A more stable financial foundation would
accelerate our progress toward becoming the popular mainstream media information source that archaeology so badly
needs. We very much want to promote archaeology to the
general public and to encourage membership in organizations such as TAS. Surely, a continuing annual contribution of $250 is a small price to advance and sustain this
important mission. Won’t you please give serious thought
to restoring your Organizational Membership with TAC?
In return, TAS will continue to receive a special benefit for joining with us in this way. All active Organizational Members are listed on our Member Organizations
page (http://www.archaeologychannel.org/content/
AOM.html). Links to that page are found throughout TAC,
so that listing will help drive traffic to the TAS Web site.

At the same time, your group can attract new members by
pointing to your association with TAC and the wealth of
programming and information that it offers. And, finally,
periodic TAC Newsletter articles featuring our professional and avocational Member groups help to raise public awareness of these groups’ organizations and activities.
To read our feature article about the Texas Archeological
Society which appeared in the May 2005 edition of TAC
Newsletter, go to the Member Spotlight section, at http://
www.archaeologychannel.org/newsletter-archives/TheArchaeology-Channel-Newsletter-May-05.htm.
We pledge to you that the vote of confidence represented by renewal of your Organizational Membership,
and by the initiation of Individual Memberships by TAS
members themselves, will yield concrete results in our
public outreach efforts within your state, across the country and around the world. With your help, we just might
be able to broaden public appreciation for the richness
and depth of the human cultural legacy!

copy of the grant application by mail, contact Donna
McCarver at 512/463-6090 or donna.mccarver@thc.state.
tx.us.
Please note that all TPTF/TAM applications must be
received by March 1, 2007. This is a firm deadline that
will enable us to review the applications and present funding recommendations for final approval to the THC commissioners at the April business meeting. This scheduling
will afford TAM 2007 archeology fair sponsors more
time to plan their events and related expenses.
Don’t delay! Start organizing your TAM 2007 event
so that you can take full advantage of this funding opportunity!

Regional News
The Big News from Region 10
By Claude Hudspeth
The biggest news from Region 10 is that a very successful
Annual Meeting was held in San Angelo. The only complaint
I received was that the bar was not open all the time.
Considering that we stressed the hotel facilities to the limits
with the number of people we had in attendance, that says a
lot. There were over 100 people who went on the field trip to
Fred and Kay Campbell’s Painted Rocks. I cannot recall a
field trip at an annual meeting with that kind of number.
Some final numbers are:
Total attendance

318

Students

32

Total at the banquet,

213

Silent auction results

6000 (approximately)

Net profit

13,300.00
(plus silent auction)

The Concho Valley Archeology Society (CVAS) has
now recovered from an Archeological Fair at the end of
September, and then the Annual Meeting three weeks later.
They have a learning field trip for to the Gill Ranch at
Knickbocker. Larry Riemenschneilder has recorded many
prehistoric and historic sites there that can be used as examples for the new members. The next weekend, they are
having a Christmas dinner on December 15th at Ft. Concho.
The Iraan Archeological Society (IAS) had a field trip to
revisit a site on Sawyer Ranch on November 18th. The site,
41PC23 was recorded by the University of Texas in the
1930s. The IAS is having their Christmas Party on the weekend of the 15th. and an Installation of Officers Banquet in
January, date to be announced.
I will be giving a presentation to the Midland Archeological Society (MAS)on December 7. Wendy Lockwood
will be conducting Rock Art recording in December.
Several members of the CVAS, IAS and the MAS attended the Center for Big Bend Studies Conference (CBBS)
in Alpine on November 9th.

Region 11 Report
Tim Roberts
I marked my one year anniversary as the Region 11
Director by attending the TAS Annual Meeting in San Angelo

in October, and presenting a paper on the prehistoric ritual
obliteration of Lower Pecos Style pictographs, a topic of research which continues to intrigue me and occupy at least
some of my ‘free’ time. I enjoyed seeing familiar faces and
meeting new acquaintances at the Annual Meeting, and hearing about some of the other research that is or has been
conducted around the state. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to
attend a couple of other archeological conferences this fall that
I had hoped to, including the Center for Big Bend Studies
Conference that was held in Alpine in November. As usual,
I’m sure that several good papers were presented; I hope I
have the opportunity to see some of these in print in the future.
While I did miss a couple of conferences in November, I
was able to spend several days in the field during this time
with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s Archeology
Survey Team at Big Bend Ranch State Park in Presidio
County. We started the process of conducting an archeological survey along a 31+ miles stretch of proposed multi-use
trail in the park. Several new archeological sites were identified during the November field session, including a possible
prehistoric vision quest site. This is one of few potential sites
of this type that have thus far been documented in the Big
Bend region.
The Center for Big Bend Studies (CBBS), Sul Ross State
University, Alpine, is also conducting archeological surveys,
as well as rock art documentation in the region. A continuing
archeological survey of portions of Big Bend National Park by
the CBBS has identified approximately 800 sites since the
first of this work was initiated in 1995. Some of the more
recently recorded sites as a result of this project have yielded
prehistoric pottery and corn cobs, items that have been relatively elusive on sites in the Big Bend to this point.
On the rock art front, the CBBS is focusing their documentation efforts on an area of Brewster County that has
revealed an unusually high concentration of petroglyph sites
in a region that is generally dominated by pictographs. The
body of data on petroglyphs in the Trans-Pecos, specifically
the Big Bend region, should be considerably enhanced
through these efforts of the CBBS.
The second report resulting from the CBBS’s TransPecos Archeological Program is scheduled to be published
sometime in December 2006. The subject of this report will
be the Paradise Site, a short-term Middle Archaic habitation
site located in Brewster County. Excavation of this site by
the CBBS in 2004 revealed well-preserved plant processing
features and other associated cultural deposits.

Looking to the future, the Salinas Missions of Abo, Grand
Quivara, and Quarai in New Mexico will be the destinations
of the El Paso Archaeological Society (EPAS) on a December
9th field trip, followed shortly thereafter by their annual Christmas Party on December 21st to be held at the El Paso Museum
of Archaeology. Fort Bliss archeologist David Legare will be
the first featured guest speaker of 2007 for EPAS, speaking
about a lithic site near Grants, New Mexico during their
monthly meeting on January 18th. More details about the
January 18th meeting and Legare’s presentation will be posted
on the EPAS website as this date approaches.

Region 12 Report
September—December 2006
Paul Smith
In September, the Texas Living History event was held
in Kerrville, Texas. Along with five other members, I participated with the Hill Country Archeological Association as
a flint knapping demonstrator and artifact examiner for the
multi-county school children who attend the yearly outing.
The HCAA worked with the children and teachers, passing
out “Texas Beyond History” bookmarks as well as Texas
Historical Commission literature to over 300 visitors.
With October “Archeological Awareness Month,”
Kerrville’s Riverside Nature Center hosted an HCAA event
demonstrating flint knapping and reviewing artifacts brought
in by over 400 visitors who received the “Texas Beyond
History” bookmarks. The HCAA sponsored Dan Potter from
the Texas Historical Commission to speak about “Indians of
the Hill Country.”

On the same October 7 weekend, the Southern Texas
Archaeological Society was a large part of Mission Archeological Day at San Jose National Park with activities, displays, and lectures. The mock dig and crafts (making frescoed
tiles and leather gorgets) were a hit. Kristi Ulrich from
UTSA’s Center for Archeological Research, Toni Figueroa
from CAR, and Susan Snow from the San Jose Park staff
gave their presentations throughout the day. Over 1300 people
attended based on the number of “Texas Beyond History”
bookmarks passed out.
The STAA met at Incarnate Word University’s International Conference Center on October 14 where Clint
McKenzie spoke about the “Fool’s Rock Shelter,” a Comal
County shelter that the Association is investigating after
being plundered.
In early November, the planning committee for the February 3-4, 2007 TAS Lithics Academy met to organize and
make plans for the event. It will be held at UTSA’s CAR.
Lecture-led by Dr. Harry Shafer, it will be a hands-on and
informative presentation for the excavator, the laboratory
worker, and the flint knapper.
On November 18, Patricia Mercado-Allinger, State Archeologist for the Texas Historical Commission Archeology
Division, spoke about the “Texas Archeological Stewardship Network” at the HCAA periodic meeting. She told the
attendees about the work done by this avocational group and
how local societies can support the network.
Region 12 was well represented at the successful and
interesting TAS Annual Meeting in San Angelo. We look
forward to having you attend in the annual meeting in San
Antonio for 2007; we will have a great time!

The Passing of Friends
Although soft spoken and mild mannered, Bill Blair got
excited about history and archeology. His lifelong interest
began in Itasca, Texas, where he was born in 1927. After
joining the Navy at an early age, Bill went on to college and
became a senior counselor and instructor of Texas History at
J. J. Pearce High School in Richardson, Texas. His enthusiasm
for collecting took a more formal turn when he became a
member of the Dallas Archeology Society in the 1950s. Over
the past five years Bill attended the 2001 and 2002 TAS
field schools at the Bowmer site and the 2005 TAS field
school in Paris, Texas. He was a tireless worker dedicated

to learning more about the
early history of man. Bill was
living in Sadler, Texas, when
he died June 26, 2006, after a
brief illness. He is survived by
his wife, Elise, three daughters
and four grandchildren. Bill
will be remembered for his
patient, consistent effort to
bring awareness of the past into
the present.

CHARLES RICHEY “CAP” EBERSOLE, died on
December 5, 2006 in Austin, Texas. Born to Eugene Dewey
Ebersole and Pauline Eliza Richey Ebersole on August 14,
1925, he was a graduate of Lamar High School. He went to
Texas A&M then enlisted in the United States Marine Corps
(USMC) and attended the V-12 program at Arkansas A&M.
He entered the University of Texas and graduated from UT
Law School in 1948. He was commissioned in the USMC in
1945, served in World War II and the Korean War and
discharged Captain. His professional career began as an oil
scout for Continental Oil 1948-1951, a landman for General
Crude 1953-1965, and culminated as a title attorney for
independent oil operators from 1965 until retirement. Richey
Ebersole loved life and people, was an avid reader, had
numerous hobbies and participated in all kinds of civic activities. He had a second career as an amateur archeologist,
was president of the Houston Archeological Society and a
steward for the Texas Historical Commission. He served as

CLIFFORD GEERTZ 1926-2006 PRINCETON, N.J.,
October 31, 2006—Clifford Geertz, an eminent scholar in
the field of cultural anthropology known for his extensive
research in Indonesia and Morocco, died at the age of 80
early yesterday morning of complications following heart
surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.
Dr. Geertz was Professor Emeritus in the School of Social
Science at the Institute for Advanced Study, where he has
served on the Faculty since 1970. Dr. Geertz’s appointment
thirty-six years ago was significant not only for the distinguished leadership it would bring to the Institute, but also
because it marked the initiation of the School of Social
Science, which in 1973 formally became the fourth School at
the Institute.
Dr. Geertz’s landmark contributions to social and cultural
theory have been influential not only among anthropologists,
but also among geographers, ecologists, political scientists,
humanists, and historians. He worked on religion, especially
Islam; on bazaar trade; on economic development; on
traditional political structures; and on village and family life.
A prolific author since the 1950s, Dr. Geertz’s many books
include The Religion of Java (1960); Islam Observed:
Religious Development in Morocco and Indonesia (1968);
The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays (1973, 2000);

Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth Century Bali (1980);
and The Politics of Culture, Asian Identities in a Splintered
World (2002). At the time of his death, Dr. Geertz was
working on the general question of ethnic diversity and its
implications in the modern world.
Peter Goddard, Director of the Institute, said, “Clifford
Geertz was one of the major intellectual figures of the twentieth century whose presence at the Institute played a crucial
role in its development and in determining its present shape.
He remained a vital force, contributing to the life of the
Institute right up to his death. We have all lost a much loved
friend.” (Press Release from the Institute of Advanced Study)

Ann M. Irwin, an Archeologist, passed away Saturday,
Dec. 9, 2006, after a long but courageous battle with cancer.
Ann was born in Kansas City, Missouri, on April 3, 1940. Her
parents were I. T. Monseth and Mary Louise Rothwell. She
met her husband, Charles (Chuck) Johnson over a spilled pot
of tea and they married Aug. 26, 1985. Ann had strength of
character, was enthusiastic, eternally optimistic and admired
by all for generosity, determination and unflappability. She
was deputy division director of the Environmental Affairs
Division when she retired from the Texas Department of Transportation after 27 years service. Ann also received one of the
highest honors awarded by TxDOT, the Raymond E. Stotzer,

Jr. Award, in 1999. Ann received her Bachelors of Art in
Anthropology and English from the University of Kansas. She
received her Masters of Art in Anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania and completed her coursework at the
University of Pennsylvania for a Ph.D., in Anthropology. She
earned numerous academic and professional honors in the
field of archeology. Ann had many pets-dogs, birds, cat. She
showed Dachshunds for many years and made many friends
through this shared love of dogs. Ann collected antiques,
made jewelry for herself and friends. Ann was sharp of mind
and wit, well read and enjoyed traveling. Ann was an incredible woman with a wonderful personality, was good hearted,
unselfish, kind, gentle, funny and endearing. Ann was an
example of goodness and loyalty. Ann and husband, Chuck,
always made friends feel welcome in their home and shared
everything they had unselfishly. Many of us believe that much
of the good in us was brought out by Ann. Her friends would
like to thank Austin Hospice for the care they gave. Three
special friends of Annie deserve recognition, Michael, Darryl
and Colleen, for the special devotion, love and attention they
gave Annie these last few months. Ann was preceded in death
by both parents and husband, Chuck Johnson, who died June
21. Survivors include dear friends and co-workers who will
never forget her. May the peace of a treasure chest of special
Annie memories comfort us all in our loss. A memorial service was held at 2:00 p.m., Friday, Dec. 15 at All Faiths
Funeral Services, 8507 N. I-35, Austin, TX.
