ABSTRACT
On March 18, 2011, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural resource survey
investigation for a proposed stormwater outfall project on Armand Bayou in southeast Harris
County, Texas. The objectives of the investigation were to locate and identify cultural materials,
sites, or historic properties within the proposed impact area, and to prepare management
recommendations regarding any identified resources. The investigations (MAC PN 10-60) were
conducted for Crouch Environmental Services, Inc., under Texas Antiquities Permit Number
5919. A total of 11 shovel tests were excavated. The testing identified significant amounts of
modern disturbance and fill most likely related to road construction and bayou maintenance
activities. No evidence of prehistoric or historic remains was identified by the investigations.
Consequently, no further archeological investigations are recommended. In the event that
archeological deposits or features should be encountered during construction, work should cease
in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission
contacted for further consultation.

INTRODUCTION
2005). While the entire project corridor was
visually examined, due to the disturbed
nature of much of the project area and the
geoarcheological potential as reflected in the
PALM predictive map (Abbott 2001), the
subsurface survey efforts (shovel testing)
were primarily focused on the areas with
soils associated with sandy mound features,
and on the area near Armand Bayou. A total
of 13 shovel tests were excavated. No
cultural materials or deposits were
identified, and it was recommended that no
additional
archeological
work
was
necessary. The current proposed stormwater
outfall alignment is related to this earlier
project, but lies outside the previously
surveyed area, and within a short distance of
Armand Bayou. Because this new area falls
within the high probability zone established
for the previous survey, and consequently, it
was determined that the additional
alignments should be covered with a 100%
pedestrian survey including both surface
observation and subsurface testing (shovel
testing).

On March 18, 2011, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation for a
proposed stormwater outfall project on
Armand Bayou in southeast Harris County,
Texas. The objectives of the investigation
were to locate and identify cultural
materials, sites, or historic properties within
the proposed impact area, and to prepare
management recommendations regarding
any identified resources. The investigations
(MAC PN 10-60) were conducted for
Crouch Environmental Services, Inc., under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5919.
The project is depicted on the La
Porte, Texas 7.5â USGS topographic map
(Figures 1, 2).
The two proposed
stormwater outfall alignments will connect
the recently improved Genoa-Red Bluff
Road with Armand Bayou. The project area
is comprised of two small linear tracts
totaling 1.09 acres (Figure 3). One of the
tracts measures approximately 900 ft long
by 30 ft wide, and parallels the eastern side
of a cleared pipeline alignment. The other
tract is located on the west side of the
pipeline, measures approximately 550 ft in
length and varies in width, and includes
outfall improvements on both sides of the
bayou.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the two alignments was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination (Figure 4; see
Appendix 1 for details). A total of 11 shovel
tests were excavated.
The field
investigations were conducted by project
archeologist Randy Ferguson and field
technician Rachael Goings. David Driver
served as the projectâs principal investigator.

In 2005, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted a 100%
pedestrian survey of the adjacent Genoa-Red
Bluff Road Right-of-Way Expansion Project
(see Figure 3; Moore and Schexnayder

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

winter temperatures average 64Â°F (18Â°C).
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches
(117 cm).
Hydrology
The project is located on Armand
Bayou, which flows into Mud Lake and
Clear Lake. The creek is depicted on the
current USGS map as a perennial stream.
The streamcourse appears to be fairly
natural and without any significant degree of
channelization.
Flora and Fauna
Harris County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The county is
situated within the pine-oak subdivision of
the Austroriparian province (Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species
of the pine-oak forest subdivision as loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus
echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak
(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests
are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such
trees
as
sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia
grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water
oak (Quercus nigra), and other species of
oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly
diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandisia
usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).

The property is depicted on sheet
126 of the Soil Survey of Harris County,
Texas (Wheeler 1976). A single soil type is
identified in the project area, Lake Charles
clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes (LcA). Lake
Charles soils are described as somewhat
poorly drained, with very slow or medium
surface runoff (Wheeler 1976:54). Based on
the PALM predictive model developed by
Abbott (2001), Lake Charles soils represent
upland clayey ancient (pre-Holocene)
alluvium with a low potential for containing
deeply buried prehistoric sites. The PALM
model classifies the project area as Map
Unit 2: Surface Survey Recommended, No
Deep
Reconnaissance
Recommended
(Abbott 2001:156).

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus
borealis,
Sciurus
niger,
Sciurus

Climate
The modern climate of the Harris
County study area is moderated by winds
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights
(Wheeler
1976:2,
66).
Summer
temperatures average 92Â°F (33Â°C), while

common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces

Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

at various times in the past (Gadus and

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy
specializes in a regionally circumscribed and
repetitive exploitation of specific floral and

southeast Texas is identified as the

territory, the nomadic populations were able

to better exploit the various resources
available within their local environment.

introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated NarvÃ¡ez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan
pottery in southeast Texas around A.D.
1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the

Anglo-American settlement in the
Harris County area began in the early 1820s,
with a number of Mexican land grants
awarded in 1824 (Henson 1996). The
modern boundaries of the county were
established as Harrisburg County by the
Texas Congress in 1836, and it was renamed
Harris County in 1839. The presence of the
highly navigable Buffalo Bayou stimulated

establishment of six railroad lines in the area
prior to the Civil War further stimulated
economic prosperity, and helped lure a

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
(see Figure 3; Moore and Schexnayder
2005). While the entire project corridor was
visually examined, due to the disturbed
nature of much of the project area and the
geoarcheological potential as reflected in the
PALM predictive map (Abbott 2001), the
subsurface survey efforts (shovel testing)
were primarily focused on the areas with
soils associated with sandy mound features,
and on the area near Armand Bayou. A total
of 13 shovel tests were excavated. No
cultural materials or deposits were
identified, and it was recommended that no
additional
archeological
work
was
necessary.

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that no previously recorded archaeological
sites are located within the project area, or
within Â½ kilometer of the tract.

From a more regional perspective,
the project is located in an area that contains
a number of stream systems, including
Armand Bayou, Horsepen Bayou, Taylor
Bayou, Clear Creek, Mud Lake, and Clear
Lake. Previous investigations along many
of these watersources have documented a
high density of prehistoric occupation.

The current project is located along
the headwaters of Armand Bayou, which is a
relatively small stream before its confluence
with Spring Gully, approximately 2.4 km
downstream. While no sites have been
recorded previously upstream from the
current project, site densities are quite high
in the areas beyond the Spring Gully
confluence. This area includes at least 12
prehistoric occupation sites (41HR81-82,
41HR88, 41HR141-143, 41HR145-148,
41HR152-153) which have been designated
as the Armand Bayou Archeological
District.
Many of these sites were
discovered in the 1970s as a result of the
Clear Lake City Salvage Project. The
northernmost end of this district lies
approximately 1 km to the southeast of the
Genoa-Red Bluff Road Stormwater Outfall
project.

The earliest work done in the area
was conducted by avocational archeologist
Wayne Neyland in the 1950s along the
banks of Clear Lake. Further investigations
followed in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
with surveys of Clear Creek, Armand
Bayou, and Mud Lake (Aten et al. 1976;
Corbin and Hester 1968; Fields and Jackson
1984; Fischer et al. 1972; Hole 1974;
McGruff and Cox 1973; Mercado-Allinger
et al. 1984). Although the site types have
included lithic scatters and a significant
Archaic cemetery site, the vast majority of
sites appear to have been focused on the
exploitation of freshwater shellfish resources
and are located directly adjacent to the
active waterways.

In 2005, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted a 100%
pedestrian survey of the adjacent Genoa-Red
Bluff Road Right-of-Way Expansion Project

9

1973:18-19). This area of concentration is
located near the current project area, its
westernmost site less than Â½ mile away.
They reported that no sites were located
west of this concentration, though they
attributed
this
lack
to
previous
channelization. A similar lack of occupation
for the upper portion of Clear Creek has
been reported by Howard et al. (1992).
They identified three types of sites (shell
middens, terrace sites, natural mound sites)
that corresponded to topographic and
environmental zones mapped along the
creek. Based on their geomorphological
assessment of the Clear Creek waterway,
there is an implication that the lack of sites
in the upper reaches is due more to the
relatively steep nature of the stream profile,
and the resultant increased surface erosion
(Howard et al. 1992:4).

The most extensive survey along
Clear Creek was conducted by the Texas
Archaeological Survey (McGuff and Cox
1973) in preparation for massive flood
control project that would enlarge and
rectify most of the streamcourse. The
project examined almost the entire length of
the creek, covering from just west of the
Fort Bend/Brazoria County line, all the way
to Galveston Bay. A total of 76 prehistoric
and 2 historic sites were identified. They
noted a bimodal distribution of sites
(McGuff and Cox 1973:2, Figure 1), with
concentrations located in the lower reaches
of the creek near Clear Lake (between miles
2-5), and in the upper reaches (between
miles 23-28). This latter group of sites was
located on terraces alongside an incise
meander, and consisted of 41 pimple mound
sites and four terrace sites (McGuff and Cox

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
A total of 11 shovel tests (STs 1-11)
were excavated. Each of the shovel tests
were excavated in 10 cm levels and screened
through Â¼â mesh (Figure 4; Appendix 1),
and all were recorded and plotted on the
project map.

The fieldwork was conducted on
March 18, 2009, and consisted of a 100%
pedestrian survey that included systematic
shovel testing and visual examination for
surface exposure of cultural materials.
The project is depicted on the La
Porte, Texas 7.5â USGS topographic map
(Figures 1, 2).
The two proposed
stormwater outfall alignments will connect
the recently improved Genoa-Red Bluff
Road with Armand Bayou. The project area
is comprised of two small linear tracts
totaling 1.09 acres (Figure 3). One of the
tracts measures approximately 900 ft long
by 30 ft wide, and parallels the eastern side
of a cleared pipeline alignment. The other
tract is located on the west side of the
pipeline, measures approximately 550 ft in
length and varies in width, and includes
outfall improvements on both sides of the
bayou. The project is located on Armand
Bayou, which appears to be fairly natural
and without any significant degree of
channelization (Figure 5). A concrete, 2lane bridge crosses Armand Bayou, and is
flanked by an unimproved drainage ditch,
that due to its location within the northern
alignment, will be replaced by the proposed
outfalls.

In the outfall alignment located
nearest to the road, the tests were placed at
intervals of approximately 30 m. In the area
adjacent to the bayou, two tests were placed
on each side of the stream. These areas near
the bayou contained a 20-50 cm thick
mantle of clayey fill material, possibly from
periods of channel cleaning/dredging. In
STs 2, 3, and 4, this fill stratum also
contained whole and crushed oyster shell
that is most likely related to the construction
of the roadbeds and bridge for the earlier
Genoa-Red Bluff Road. What appeared to
be intact ancient (pre-Holocene) soils were
reached below the fill layers (see Appendix
1). No fill was visible on the northeast side
of the pond, suggesting less construction and
bayou maintenance-related disturbances had
occurred in areas further from the stream.
No prehistoric or historic cultural materials
were found in any of the shovel tests placed
within this alignment.
The
second,
longer
outfall
alignment parallels the east edge of a cleared
pipeline easement (Figure 8). Shovel testing
intervals varied from 40 m near the stream,
to 100+ m in the end away from the stream.
These areas also demonstrated various
degrees of disturbance and fill down to
depths of 15-38 cm. In each of these tests,
what appeared to be intact clay, preHolocene, subsoils were encountered below
the disturbed soils and fill zones. No
prehistoric or historic cultural materials
were found in any of the shovel tests
excavated in this second alignment.

Vegetation in the project property
consisted of a dense mix of trees and
underbrush, with 0 percent surface visibility
(Figure 6). One of the alignments crossed a
shallow, 60 m diameter artificial pond
(Figure 7). The pond is not depicted on the
1920, 1944, or 1949 USGS quad maps, and
is most likely related to road construction
and runoff/drainage. The Genoa-red Bluff
Road post-dates the 1920 map, but is present
on the 1940s maps.

RECOMMENDATIONS
shovel tests were excavated. The testing
identified significant amounts of modern
disturbance and fill most likely related to
road construction and bayou maintenance
activities. Eight of the 11 shovel tests were
able to reach what appeared to be preHolocene sediments.
No evidence of
prehistoric or historic remains was identified
by the investigations.

On March 18, 2011, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation for a
proposed stormwater outfall project on
Armand Bayou in southeast Harris County,
Texas. The objectives of the investigation
were to locate and identify cultural
materials, sites, or historic properties within
the proposed impact area, and to prepare
management recommendations regarding
any identified resources. The investigations
(MAC PN 10-60) were conducted for
Crouch Environmental Services, Inc., under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5919.

Consequently,
no
further
archeological
investigations
are
recommended.
In the event that
archeological deposits or features should be
encountered during construction, work
should cease in the immediate vicinity and
the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination. A total of 11
