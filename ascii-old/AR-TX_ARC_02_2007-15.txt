ABSTRACT
Approximately 5.6 miles of sewer pipeline route will be constructed by the
North Texas Municipal Water District about 3 miles northwest of Plano in
southwestern Collin County, Texas. The proposed route begins at Ohio
Drive and parallels the east bank of White Rock Creek until the route
encounters SH 121 where the route turns northeast and parallels the
highway for approximately 4 miles. After a review by the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission, it was decided that an
archaeological survey needed to be conducted of the 1.6 miles along the
east bank of White Rock Creek. In early April 2007, AR Consultants, Inc.
conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of approximately
1.6 miles of the proposed pipeline route, most of which had been
disturbed, starting at Ohio Drive and terminating at SH 121 in the upland
Blackland Prairie under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4470. The
archaeological survey was done for Freese and Nichols, Inc. which is
doing the environmental permitting for the North Texas Municipal Water
District. No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground
surface and none were uncovered in nine shovel tests.
Based upon the absence of archaeological sites, AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted
along the proposed pipeline route. However, if buried cultural materials
are encountered during construction, work should stop in that area
immediately and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
The North Texas Municipal Water District intends to construct at least 5.6 miles of
pipeline route about 3 miles northwest of Plano in southwestern Collin County, Texas.
The proposed route begins at Ohio Drive and parallels the east bank of White Rock Creek
until the route encounters SH 121 where the route turns northeast and parallels the
highway for approximately 4 miles. The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission reviewed the project and decided that an archaeological survey needed to be
conducted along the east bank of White Rock Creek in a letter dated February 9, 2007.
Therefore, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an archaeological survey of approximately 1.6
miles of the proposed pipeline route adjacent to the east bank of White Rock Creek in
early April 2007. The proposed pipeline route is to be placed approximately 30 feet east
of an existing pipeline. As previously stated, the proposed pipeline route begins at Ohio
Drive and runs northeast to SH 121 (Figure 1). The archaeological survey was done for
Freese and Nichols, Inc. which is designing the proposed pipeline route and performing
the environmental permitting for the North Texas Municipal Water District.
Since the North Texas Municipal Water District is a political entity of the State of Texas,
a Texas Antiquities Permit is required. The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission issued Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4470 for this archaeological
survey. In addition, since the proposed pipeline route is to be placed on the southeast
bank of White Rock Creek, possible relevant federal legislation includes the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of
1974, as amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No. 11593 “Protection and
Enhancement of the Cultural Environment” and Procedures for the Protection of Historic
and Cultural Properties (36CFR800), Appendix C. The purpose of the archaeological
survey was to determine if cultural materials were present, make recommendations about
their significance and determine how they might be impacted by construction.
The following report contains a brief description of the natural environment, the culture
history and then a review of previous investigations in the area. This is followed by the
research design and methodology. The results section follows. Recommendations follow
and a list of references cited concludes the report. This report was written in accordance
with the guidelines for reports developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (N.D.)
and adopted by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area in southwestern Collin County is near the western edge of the Blackland
Prairie (Diggs, Lipscomb, and O’Kennon 1999), and it is this setting that characterizes
much of North Central Texas. The prairie is dissected by the East Fork of the Trinity
River on the eastern edge of Collin County. Narrow bands of bottomland forest are
confined to the drainages throughout the county. For more than a century, parts of the
area have been farmed extensively. The native vegetation exists today in only a few relict
prairies and woodland habitats.
The geological formation underlying the present day ground surface is the Upper
Cretaceous-aged Austin Chalk (Bureau of Economic Geology 1967). The Austin Chalk is
one of the formations that the Blackland Prairie soil is derived from. Bedrock
decomposition and pedogenesis in the study area have resulted in creation of the soil
association known as the Houston Black-Austin which consists of gently sloping to
sloping upland clays (Hanson and Wheeler 1969: General Soil Map). Specific soils along
White Rock Creek’s east bank consist of Austin silty clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes,
eroded Austin silty clay with 3 to 5 and 5 to 8 percent slopes, Houston Black clay with 1
to 3 percent slopes and eroded Houston Black clay with 2 to 4 percent slopes (Hanson
and Wheeler 1969:Sheet 44).
Water is a limited resource in the prairie environment and White Rock Creek is mapped
as perennial on the Hebron, Texas 7.5’ USGS map but is mapped as intermittent on the
General Soils Map for Collin County (Hanson and Wheeler 1969:Sheet 44).
The upland surface has been cleared of most trees and supports Bermuda and other
grasses that have been invaded by mesquites. The edge of the upland and the valley
support numerous young and old trees including bois d’arc, American elm, cedar elm,
hackberry, honey locust along with various weeds and masses of greenbriars. According
to various authors, including Lynott (1979), the prairie once supported a cover of tall
grasses and was inhabited by now absent herbivores including bison and antelope.
Certainly, deer inhabited the floodplain forests, but this environment is not abundant in
the survey area.
Paleoenvironmental change is not well documented but it is summarized by Prikryl
(1993:192-193). Prior to 12,000 B.C., the climate of north central Texas was cooler and
moister than at present. Between 12,000 and 8,000 B.C., the climate became warmer and
this continued to the present, but with brief mesic periods. It is suggested that the
presence of high grass pollen and low arboreal pollen between 5550 and 1050 B.C. show
a drying with a return of arboreal pollen after 1050 B.C. The later change is similar to
the environment of today. High grass pollen also occurs at approximately A.D. 450 and
from A.D. 1550 to 1650, thus also suggesting drier periods. The presence of paleosols
between A.D. 1 and 1,000 suggests an increase in moisture during this period with a
return to drier conditions after A.D. 1,000.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Over the past several decades, cultural resources investigations in north-central Texas
have varied due to the locations and types of projects carried out; therefore, the data base
of information to which new projects can be compared is limited. This is particularly true
for eastern Denton and Collin County which are located in the uplands of the Blackland
Prairie. The following culture history is derived from the monograph, “Lower Elm Fork
Prehistory”, by Daniel J. Prikryl (1990). Prikryl’s framework includes six prehistoric
periods, to which the historic Native American and European periods have been added.
Historic European
Historic Native American
Late Prehistoric II
Late Prehistoric I
Late Archaic
Middle Archaic
Early Archaic
Paleoindian

A.D. 1800 to Present
A.D. 1600 to A.D. 1850
A.D. 1300 to 1600
A.D. 700 to A.D. 1300
2,000 B.C. to A.D. 700
4,000 B.C. to 2,000 B.C.
6,000 B.C. to 4,000 B.C.
ca. 11,000 B.C. to 6,000 B.C.

The history of the Collin County region can be traced to as early as 8,000 to 9,000 B.C.
and since that time, it appears to have been continuously occupied (Crook N.D.). The
physical evidence of past occupation in the county has been termed "cultural resources,"
and many of these resources have been of such significance that they have been
recognized, recorded and in many cases preserved (RMA/Texas 1986).
Prehistoric Native American settlement in Collin County began at least 10,000 years ago
as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points. No very early
prehistoric sites have been recorded in the county but Paleo-Indian sites have been
reported from Denton County to the west in the valley of the Elm Fork of the Trinity
River (Crook and Harris 1957; Ferring 2001; Prikryl 1990). Nevertheless, artifact
collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff and other Paleo-Indian
points from the surface of sites in the region (Meltzer and Bever 1995). The presence of
exotic, i.e., non-local, lithic resources indicates that these early people traveled a territory
where higher quality lithics were available or were involved in a system of raw material
trading. These early people hunted now extinct large game but probably also foraged off
the land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from 7,000 to 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late as
A.D. 700-800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the county but particularly along
the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather native foods
(Lynott 1977). Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock and scrapers are common
artifacts found on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued making and using
exotic cherts for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local
lithics for chipped stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde Gravels
(Menzer and Slaughter 1971; Byrd 1971). Larger Archaic sites have been recorded and
tested at Lake Lavon (Dawson and Sullivan 1973) and these sites are generally located on

terraces or ridges that overlook the East Fork of the Trinity. Smaller lithic scatters have
been recorded in upland areas throughout the county in conjunction with surveys of Soil
Conservation Service flood-water retarding dams and other projects (Lynott 1974;
Hughston and Lynott 1974; Peter 1990; Hunt, Peter and Allday 1991). These sites appear
to be Archaic in age but none have been thoroughly studied and their relationship to the
Lake Lavon sites is uncertain.
About A.D. 700-800, a major change is found in the artifacts and settlement patterning of
the prehistoric sites. Sites tend to congregate along the main stem of the East Fork of the
Trinity River. This is attributed to the drying up of the smaller tributaries. During this
period, which is known as the Late Prehistoric, Caddoan pottery from East Texas appears
as trade material along with the indigenous Nocona Plain pottery. It has been suggested
that farming may have been practiced. Arrowheads appear about this same time and
apparently the bow and arrow had been added to the hunting tools. The other interesting
thing is the appearance of large, circular pits constructed at sites along the East Fork and
its tributaries. No good explanation has been posed about the function of these features
although various authors have offered their interpretations (Stephenson 1952; Lynott
1975; Bruseth and Martin 1987).
At the end of the Late Prehistoric period, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of the Collin County and the north central Texas area based on an absence
of sites with trade goods that might have been obtained from French, Spanish or English
traders (Skinner 1988). This simplistic interpretation is tied to a general drying trend and
attempts to factor in negative information generated by professional and avocational
archaeologists who have conducted numerous site surveys throughout the region (Peter,
Cliff and Green 1996:2). There is very little evidence of historic era Native American
occupation anywhere in either county although historic accounts indicate that groups
were present in the early 1800's.
European settlement in the study area began by the mid-1800's with the establishment of
the Peter's Colony after Texas independence. Collin County was established in 1846 and
the county seat was at Buckner until 1848 when it was moved to McKinney. Settlement
has continued to the present. By the turn of the century, all of the major communities had
been established and some had passed away. The best summary of the history and
prehistory of Collin County, and adjacent Denton County, is the document, An Open
Space Plan for Collin County (RMA/Texas 1986).
Previous Investigations
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2007), no archaeological sites are
listed within or adjacent to the study area. No historic residences were located along the
proposed pipeline route on the 1930 Soil Map for Collin County, Texas (Beck et al.
1930). However, historic residences are present along White Rock Creek in the vicinity
of SH 121 on the 1936 General Highway Map of Collin County, Texas (Texas State
Highway Department 1936).

AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd 2006) conducted an archaeological survey of approximately
37 acres of a proposed development site about 3.2 miles northeast of the study area. The
development site is located west of and adjacent to Custer Road and north of SH 121 and
is bounded by Rowlett Creek to the west. No archaeological sites were found.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The purpose of this research design is to insure that fieldwork made a contribution to the
prehistory and history of Collin County, Texas. The following three research questions
were posed.
The first research question concerns the prehistoric occupation of the study area.
Although White Rock is mapped as perennial on the USGS map, no
floodplain is present in the study area; therefore is unlikely that buried
cultural deposits are present and also unlikely that the area was occupied
prehistorically due to the low biotic diversity. In addition, Uvalde gravel is
presumed absent; therefore, the presence of quarry sites is unlikely.
The second question concerns the historic occupation of the study area.
It was predicted that historic sites were likely to be located along
roadways in well drained settings that were not farmed.
The third question guided the survey work in this survey as well as any archeological
survey done.
How did past people use the land, what record of this use did they leave
behind?
Methodology
The proposed pipeline route has a right-of-way of approximately 100 feet wide (10 feet
permanent and 90 temporary) and is about 1.6 miles long. As previously mentioned, the
proposed pipeline route is located approximately 30 feet east of an existing North Texas
Municipal Water District sewer pipeline. Armed with the USGS map, soil map, shovels,
a camera and field notes, the archaeologists carefully inspected the ground surface in
transects that ran southwest-northeast and the archaeologists were spaced approximately
10 m apart. They also made notes about the vegetation, soil and soil exposure and took
photographs. Since the study area is adjacent to a creek, shovel tests were excavated at
100 m as suggested by the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002) despite the upland
setting. Approximately 26 shovel tests should be excavated along the creek. Shovel tests
were not dug in mechanically disturbed areas or where the ground visibility was 30
percent or more. The clay matrices were manually broken and visually inspected for
cultural resources as were the pit walls.
Backhoe trenching was not done due to the fact that White Rock Creek does not have a
well developed floodplain in which cultural materials would be buried and preserved.

RESULTS
Survey began at Ohio Drive and went northeast to SH 121. Shovel tests are described
generally in the text, but specific information is provided in Table 1. Shovel test locations
are plotted on Figure 1. It was intended to excavate 26 shovel tests, but due to disturbance
from construction and dumping, only 16 shovel tests were excavated.
The proposed pipeline route runs between a concrete trail and Sweetbriar Road (Figure 3)
for approximately half the distance between Ohio Drive and McDermott Road. The slope
consists of construction fill based on exploratory shovel tests which were not described.
The vegetation consists of dandelions, milkweed, bunch grass and native grasses. Ground
visibility ranged from less than 5 to 30 percent. Eye-height visibility was excellent. No
recorded shovel tests were excavated due to the presence of the fill and no cultural
materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface.

Figure 3.

Proposed pipeline route is to be placed between concrete trail and
Sweetbriar Road to the right. The slope consists of fill material. View is to

Shovel test (hereafter ST) 1 was excavated approximately 50 m northeast of where the
concrete trail terminates. The shovel test uncovered 34 cm of culturally sterile clay that
contained limestone gravel. The proposed pipeline route runs through improved grassland

(Figure 4) that probably is associated with the apartment complex east of the proposed
pipeline route although no trail has been constructed. Approximately 130 m northeast of
ST 1, ST 2 uncovered 39 cm of clay containing limestone gravel overlying clay subsoil.
The subsoil may be the actual soil and the overlying matrix may be fill. No cultural
materials were uncovered. Shovel test 3 was excavated about 120 m northeast of ST 2
where the proposed pipeline route turns sharply more northeast. The upper 27 cm
consisted of fill and the clay found in the lower portion of ST 2 was found to range from
27 to 40 cm in ST 3. Northeast of ST 3, the proposed pipeline route runs close to an
apartment complex and on the slope of a hill. No shovel tests were excavated and no
cultural materials were seen on the ground surface from ST 1 to the intermediate tributary
to White Rock Creek.

Figure 4.

View from ST 1 northeast. Note concrete manhole to the left center of
picture. View is to the northeast.

Shovel test 4 was excavated approximately 5 m from the south bank of the tributary and
uncovered 35 cm of culturally sterile clay. The tributary is 3+ m wide and deep. Clear
water was flowing over a limestone bedrock substrate. No buried cultural materials were
seen in the vertical creek banks. Hackberry and elm trees were present on the northeast
side of the creek and the understory vegetation includes the previously described
vegetation as well as thistle and saw greenbriar. Ground visibility ranged from less than 5
to 70 percent where bedrock was present on the ground surface. Shovel test 5 was placed
on a small knoll approximately 6 m northeast of the tributary. The shovel test uncovered

17 cm of loamy clay overlying mottled clay subsoil that extended to 33+ cm below the
ground surface. The shovel test was culturally sterile. The ground was disturbed from ST
5 to McDermott Road (Figure 5); therefore, no shovel tests were excavated and no
cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface from the tributary
to McDermott Road.

Figure 5.

View from ST 4 to McDermott Road. Note brush on push and log piles.
View is to the northeast.

From approximately 30 m northeast of McDermott Road to Robinson Road, piles of
concrete, brick, timber and limestone gravel/bedrock (Figure 6) were present. No shovel
tests were placed among the debris piles and no cultural materials older than 50 years
were seen on the ground surface.
From Robinson Road to CR 62, the area along the proposed pipeline had been disturbed
by construction activities (Figure 7) and past construction (Figure 8). The proposed
pipeline will be placed between the concrete trail and the tree line, if not along the
concrete trail. Four shovel tests (6 through 9) were excavated along this portion of the
route and uncovered culturally sterile clay that ranged from 33 to 38 cm below the
ground surface. No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface
along in the disturbed areas from Robinson Road to CR 62.

Unimproved pasture is present from CR 62 to SH 121 (Figure 9). Vegetation was similar
to that previously described except that hog weed was present and the grass was much
taller, about a meter. Ground visibility ranged from less than 5 to 30 percent. Shovel test
10 was placed on a bench overlooking White Rock Creek and uncovered 37 cm of sterile
clay. A residence was shown on the USGS map in this area and an intensive survey of the
area failed to yield any house foundation, cistern, well or other historic features.
However, irises were found, indicating that the house probably was located on a bench
east of the proposed pipeline route.
Shovel tests 11 through 16 were placed in the unimproved pasture. Culturally sterile clays
were encountered to depths ranging from 35 to 39 cm of culturally sterile clay. No
cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface from CR 62 to SH
121.
Conclusions
As expected, no prehistoric sites were discovered along the proposed pipeline route. This
probably was a result of the low biotic diversity, probable absence of perennial water and
the lack of knappable lithic resources. Even if White Rock Creek was perennial, it is
doubtful that the trees/vegetation and associated animals would have fed an aboriginal
band for any length of time. Historic residences were probably removed for farming
activities and were further east of the creek to avoid seasonal flooding.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Since no archaeological sites were discovered, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that
further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted and that the North Texas
Municipal Water District be allowed to construct the pipeline from Ohio Drive to SH
121. However, if buried cultural deposits are encountered during construction, work
should stop immediately in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be contacted. Work should not continue until the proper
investigations have been conducted after consultations with the Texas Historical
Commission.
