The Cunningham-Gray Collection from
Austin County, Texas

Grant D. Hall

ABSTRACT
An assemblage of 82 artifact specimens collected from a site or sites along the
Brazos River in Austin County is described. Dart points and arrow points
present in the collection are diagnostic of the Late Paleoindian (Angostura) to
Late Prehistoric periods, with a full Archaic sequence represented as well. Also
present are conch shell pendants and two ground stone artifacts, a celt and an
adze. The celt and adze are made of stones likely originating in the Ouachita
Mountains of Arkansas. The presence of the shell ornaments and exotic ground
stone artifacts is consistent with findings previously made at certain Late Archaic cemeteries in the lower reaches of the Brazos and Colorado rivers.

INTRODUCTION

The specimens in the collection described here were picked up over a period of years by a resident of Austin County as they eroded out of cattle trails
cutting through a bluff face leading down to the floodplain of the Brazos River.
The locations of sites yielding the artifacts are not published at the request of
the property owner. The collection is now in the possession of individuals residing in Houston, Texas. Further details concerning the sites and collection are
on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas
at Austin.
The individual who collected these artifacts is now long-deceased. It was
therefore not possible to obtain his direct account of the circumstances under
which the finds were originally made. Members of the collector’s family were,
however, able to specify a short stretch of the Brazos River as the area where the
artifacts were found. Several prehistoric sites are officially recorded for this
general area and, in the absence of a thorough archeological survey, it is possible
that some additional unrecorded sites are present. Alhough it is the impression of
the relatives that the finds were all made on one site, it is more likely that the
assemblage is an amalgam from several sites present in the vicinity. This conclusion is based on observations made by the author and Mr. Joe Hudgins during
limited reconnaissance activities in the area.

ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS

All of the specimens in this collection are made of stone or shell. Four
general descriptive categories are defined for the stone artifacts: Thick Bifaces,
Thin Bifaces, Uniface, and Ground Stone (Table 1). Among the lithics, 66 of
the 68 chipped stone specimens are made of chert. There is one piece of brown
petrified wood and one of jasper (brown to light brown "moss agate"). A celt
and an adze represent the ground stone category. The adze is made of a metamorphic slate or argillite and the celt is a very fine-grained igneous diorite.
The chert represented in the collection is generally of very good quality. It
is fine-grained and has few imperfections. The most common colors present are
light brown, tannish-cream, brown, and tannish-brown. Brown or white speckling is sometimes seen in these major color groups. Less common colors are
tannish-gray, mottled tan-brown-gray, and mottled and/or banded gray to dark
gray. Small numbers of the following make up the balance of the chert colors:
light gray, dark gray, pinkish-gray with gray stripes and spots, dark brown and
tan banded, and cream-white (a heavy patina).
The range of colors present among chert specimens in this collection
indicates that most of the raw materials were procured locally. Today, there are
extensive gravel bars along the active channel of the Brazos River in the area
where the collection was made. Evidence provided by the specimens indicates
that these same local resources were available in prehistoric times as well.
However, there are six large bifaces in the collection that range in length from
10-16 cm. The size of these specimens is such that the chert used in their
manufacture was probably not procured locally, as the chert cobbles now present
in the Brazos River gravel bars are not big enough to yield bifaces this large. In
one case (Specimen 7), Georgetown chert from Central Texas is unquestionably
represented. For the remaining large biface specimens, a raw material resource
area somewhere closer to Central Texas (i.e., to the west of Austin County) is
suggested.
Twenty-six of the chipped stone tools are probably made of heat-treated
chert. This observation is based on the presence of glossy or waxy sheens visible on the specimen surfaces and/or on atypical material colors such as pinkish-gray, reddish-brown or tan, tannish-orange, reddish-orange, or pinkish-tan.
Marine shell ornaments in this collection were modified to the extent that
a positive species identification cannot be made. A substantial number of marine shell artifacts collected from several other sites in the region were made
from the shells of a big conch called the lightning whelk, Busycon contrarium.
Big conchs of this species occur along the Texas gulf coast, which would have
been the closest source of the raw materials for specimens found in Austin
County. For marine shell artifacts of this type showing up elsewhere in the region, Hall (1981:222, 306) has suggested that the artifacts were imported from
Alabama or Florida. Steele (1988:238) has recently concurred with this view.

CHIPPED STONE
Thick Bifaces (Specimens 1-6). There are six thick bifaces in the collection. All except Specimen 6 are complete (Figure 1). Four of the specimens
retain patches of cortex on their faces or ends. Specimen 2 exhibits notching at
one end which formed a short stem or spur. Specimen 6 has a heavy patina.
Thin Bifacial Knives (Specimens 7-8). Two specimens are classified as
thin bifacial knives. Specimen 7 is a beveled knife made of mottled gray and
dark gray Georgetown chert (Figure 2). The chert appears to have been heattreated. Knives of this type are considered diagnostic of the Late Prehistoric
period. Specimen 8 is a triangular blade of tannish-gray chert. It, too, was probably heat-treated.
Unifacial Scraper (Specimen 9). There is one unifacial side- and end
scraper. It is made of dark brown and tan banded chert which was possibly heattreated.
Angostura (Specimen 10). This point is made of banded brown and dark
brown chert with speckles of patina; flaking is very fine. The chert appears to
have been heat-treated. This type is diagnostic of the Late Paleoindian period
from 6500 to 6000 B.C. (Turner and Hester 1985:66).
Lerma (Specimens 11-13). Specimen 11 is a finely flaked point made of
cream-white chert, its color a result of heavy patination. The stem edges are
heavily ground for a length of 3.2 cm up from the base. This artifact type is
diagnostic of the Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods (Suhm and Jelks
1962:168; Turner and Hester 1985:116).
Specimens 12 and 13 may be of the Lerma type, but the flaking and symmetry are not as precise as exhibited in Specimen 11. Specimen 12 is made of
brown chert which may have been heat-treated. No stem grinding is evident.
Specimen 13 is of dark gray chert. It is crudely flaked and no stem grinding
was detected.
Lanceolate (Specimen 14). Specimen 14 is a lanceolate-shaped thin biface.
It is made of tannish-gray chert with patches of patina. Flaking is coarse.
Leaf-Shaped (Specimen 15). This thin biface is made of light brown chert.
The blade edges are ground from the base upward for a length of 2.7 cm.
Bell (Specimen 16). This Bell dart point is made of light brown chert (Figure 3). One barb and shoulder are missing. The blade appears to have been reworked. There is one basal thinning flake scar. This type is diagnostic of the
Early Archaic period, dating from 6000 to 3500 B.C. (Turner and Hester
1985:72).
Bulverde (Specimens 17-18). Two dart points are typed Bulverde. Specimen 17 is made of brown chert with tan mottling. Specimen 18 is of light brown
chert. The distal tip and one barb are missing. This type is diagnostic of the
period from 3000 to 2500 B.C. (Suhm and Jelks 1962:170; Turner and Hester
1985:73).

Yarbrough (Specimens 19-21). Specimen 19 is made of mottled tan and
light brown chert. Specimen 20 is of brown heat-treated chert. Specimen 21 is
tan heat-treated chert. The type is diagnostic of the Early Archaic period (Suhm
and Jelks 1962:262; Turner and Hester 1985:160).
Morrill (Specimens 22-25). Four specimens correspond to the Morrill type,
an Early and Middle Archaic period diagnostic (Suhm and Jelks 1962:224;
Turner and Hester 1985:129). Chert colors represented include brown, light
brown, and tan. Specimen 59 has a frosting of patina and the chert appears to
have been heat-treated.

Morhiss (Specimens 26-28). Specimen 26 is made of tannish-cream heattreated chert. It compares favorably with the Morhiss type, diagnostic of the Late
Archaic period around 800 B.C. (Turner and Hester 1985:127-128). Specimens
27 and 28 lack stems, but have the size and blade outline characteristic of
Morhiss. Specimen 27 is of pinkish-gray chert with a gray stripe and spot. This
unusual color was probably imparted by heat-treating. Specimen 28 is made of
tannish-brown chert with brown speckles. This point is similar to the Johnson
type, an Early and Middle Archaic period diagnostic (Turner and Hester
1985:108-109).

Pontchartrain (Specimen 29). This long, slender dart point has the distal
tip broken off. The blade edges have been reworked, giving the blade a bevel.
The specimen is made of mottled tan and light brown chert. The Pontchartrain
type is diagnostic of the Middle to Transitional Archaic periods from 2000 B.C.
to A.D. 500 (Turner and Hester 1985:143).
Untyped Dart Point (Specimen 30). Specimen 30 is a long, broad sidenotched dart point. It is made of cream-gray chert which may be from the
Georgetown area of Texas. The chert appears to have been heat-treated.
Pedernales (Specimens 31-32). Specimen 31 is made of tan-brown chert
(Figure 4). There is a slight indentation in the base. It is quite well flaked.

diagnostic of the Middle Archaic period, from 2000 to 1200 B.C. (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:236-238; Turner and Hester 1985:139-140).
Kent (Specimens 33-34). Specimen 33 is made of light brown and reddishorange chert. This color probably resulted from heat treatment. There is a patch
of cortex on the base of the stem. Specimen 34 is of reddish-tan chert and was
made on a long flake. The striking platform is preserved on the stem base, and
there is a patch of cortex on one face. The blade edges are reworked and
crooked. The Kent type dates from the Middle through Transitional Archaic

periods from ca. 2000 B.C. to A.D. 500 (Suhm and Jelks 1962:200; Turner and
Hester 1985:110).
Palmillas (Specimen 35). This dart point is made of light brown chert. The
Palmillas type is diagnostic of the Middle and Late Archaic periods (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:230; Turner and Hester 1985:134).
Gary (Specimens 36-45). Ten dart points are typed Gary, diagnostic of the
Middle to Transitional Archaic periods from 2500 B.C. to A.D. 700 or 800
(Suhm and Jelks 1962:198; Turner and Hester 1985:101). Tan, brown, light
brown, and gray cherts predominate. Four specimens appear to be made of heattreated chert. Specimen 45 is made of brown petrified wood. It has a striking
platform at the proximal end and possible asphaltum or other hafting cement on
the stem.
Marcos (Specimen 46). This dart point is made of reddish-brown heattreated chert. The Marcos type dates to the Late Archaic and Transitional Archaic periods from 600 B.C. to A.D. 200 (Turner and Hester 1985:117).
Ensor (Specimen 47). The specimen is made of light gray chert. The Ensor
is characteristic of the Transitional Archaic period, from ca. 200 B.C. to A.D.
600 (Turner and Hester 1985:94).
Ellis (Specimen 48). Made of brown chert that appears to have been heattreated, Specimen 48 is frosted with patina (Figure 5). The Ellis type is diagnostic of the Middle to Transitional Archaic periods from 2000 B.C. to A.D.
700 (Turner and Hester 1985:93).
Edgewood (Specimen 49). Specimen 49 is made of tannish-orange heattreated chert. Edgewood is a Transitional Archaic type (Turner and Hester
1985:91).
Untyped Small Dart Points (Specimens 50-54). Specimen 50 is a
stemmed dart point made of cream chert. The stem is rectangular, expanding
slightly toward the straight base. The shoulders are pronounced, but not barbed.
Blade edges are slightly convex.
Specimen 51 is a side-notched dart point made of light brown chert. Blade
edges are straight to sightly convex.
Specimen 52 is an unusual bipointed thin biface. It is made of brown chert
that appears to have been heat-treated. One tip has been broken off. This artifact may have functioned as a perforator or drill.
Specimen 53 is a stemmed dart point made of brown chert. The blade edges
are pronouncedly convex. The stem has parallel sides and a slightly convex base,
and the shoulders are weak.
Specimen 54 is a triangular thin biface made of gray chert. This artifact is
probably an unfinished or discarded preform.
Scallorn (Specimens 55-61). Seven arrowpoints in the collection are typed
as Scallorns. Such artifacts are diagnostic of the early part of the Late Prehistoric period, from A.D. 700 to 1200 (Turner and Hester 1985:189). These points
are made of brown, light brown, tan-brown, cream-tan, or pinkish-tan cherts.

Perdiz (Specimens 62-65). Four Perdiz arrowpoints occur in the collection. The type is diagnostic of the latter part of the Late Prehistoric period, from
ca. A.D. 1200 to 1500+ (Turner and Hester 1985:187). These points are made
of brown, light brown, or cream cherts. One specimen was made of heat-treated
chert.

Untyped Arrow Points (Specimens 66-68). Specimen 66 is made of brown

chert. The stem is broken off, so this artifact cannot be positively typed.
Specimen 67 is made of light brown chert. Its stem is missing.
Specimen 68 is made of reddish-brown chert. The color may be a result of
burning or heat treating.

GROUNDSTONE
From a regional standpoint, the two most unusual specimens in the
Cunningham-Gray collection are an adze and a celt. Both of these tools are made
of ground stone (Figure 6).
Celt (Figure 6A). The celt is made of light greenish-gray very fine-grained
diorite, an igneous rock. This material identification was made by Dr. Robert
Folk of the Department of Geology, The University of Texas at Austin. The
specimen has a length of 8 cm, a width of 4.7 cm, and a thickness of 2.5 cm.
Adze (Figure 6B). The adze is made of very dark gray slate or argillite, a
metamorphic rock, as identified by Dr. Folk. This adze is subrectangular in
outline shape, tapering slightly from a maximum width at the distal or bit end
down to the narrower proximal end. It is 15.4 cm in length, 4.8 cm in width,
and 1.0 cm thick. Centered on the specimen, and 4.1 cm from the proximal end,
is a biconically drilled perforation having a diameter of 0.5 cm. Around this hole
on one face of the adze is a patch of black substance suggestive of a hafting
cement, perhaps asphaltum or aged tree sap. Embedded within this black substance are flecks of a material which, at low-power magnification, appear to be
wood. If the black substance is indeed hafting cement, it is possible that it has
preserved vestiges of a wooden handle once attached to the adze. On both faces
of the piece, striations and scratches are visible, apparently resulting from the
grinding originally done to work it into its present shape. The bit is very dull,
actually having been flattened. The dulling seems to have been intentional, rather
than the result of use.
Dr. Folk notes that the metamorphic slate or argillite and igneous diorite
used to make the adze and celt are not found naturally anywhere in Texas east
of the Big Bend. Given their characteristics, he suggests that the Ouachita Mountains of western Arkansas are the most likely source of the rocks.

MARINE SHELL ORNAMENTS
Twelve marine shell ornaments are present in the Cunningham-Gray collection (Figure 7). As mentioned above, the species of the shells cannot be positively identified, but it is believed to be the conch known as the lightning whelk,
B. contrarium. Outline shapes vary from triangular, to oval, to subcircular, to
rectangular and trapezoidal. Ten of the shells have single perforations. One has

two holes and another has three; both conical and biconical holes were drilled
to make the perforations. Metric attributes for these shell ornaments are provided in Table 2.
Specimen 1 1 is unusual in that each face has a single groove running the
length of the piece (see Figure 7). On one face the groove is centered over the
perforation, while on the other side, the groove is offset to one edge. On Specimen 6 the edges of the perforation are smooth and highly polished, as if by the
repeated action of a cord drawn through the hole.

DISCUSSION
The Cunningham-Gray collection is noteworthy for the long sequence of
prehistoric activity evidenced by the time-diagnostic artifacts present. In this
respect, however, it is not atypical of the general region of Southeast Texas it
represents. Patterson (1985, 1989) and Patterson et al. (1987) have shown that
there are a number of sites in the region having similar lengthy sequences of
occupation. Based on the available diagnostics, the sequence began 8,000 to
8,500 years ago as suggested by the presence of an Angostura point and a
possibly related lanceolate thin biface with basal edge grinding. The Early,
Middle, and Late Archaic periods are each represented by a variety of chipped
stone types. Scallorn and Perdiz arrow points mark activity during the Late
Prehistoric period from around A.D. 700 to perhaps as late as A.D. 1500. For
all of the prehistoric periods represented in the Cunningham-Gray collection,
the artifacts present are well within the range of types to be expected for this
part of Texas.
Most of the chipped stone artifacts were probably made out of locally
available cherts, the gravel bars of the nearby Brazos River being the most likely
source of raw materials used. However, the large thick bifaces and thin bifacial
knives are made from cores too large to have originated locally. Lithic resource

areas further west must have been utilized. In the case of one large beveled knife
(Specimen 7), chert obviously originating in the Georgetown area along the
Balcones Escarpment was used in its manufacture.
The presence of two ground stone artifacts and a number of marine shell
ornaments in the Cunningham-Gray collection suggests that one or more human burials may have eroded out of the site(s) that were being collected. Area
sites containing Middle or Late Archaic cemetery components, such as Albert
George (Walley 1955), Ernest Witte (Hall 1981), and Ferguson (Patterson et aI.
1993), have previously yielded ground stone artifacts and marine shell orna-

Most of the ground stone artifacts from the Albert George site (a boatstone),
Ernest Witte (boatstones and a gorget), and Ferguson (tubular beads), are made
of igneous and meta-sedimentary rocks originating in the Ouachita Mountains,
perhaps near Little Rock, Arkansas. The celt and adze reported here are also
made of lithic raw materials most likely derived from that same region. Thus,
the raw material resource area for these ground stone specimens had been indicated by previous finds. However, the artifact types --celt and adze -- are a
rare occurrence in Southeast Texas. Their presence in the Cunningham-Gray collection permits expansion of the assemblage of ground stone artifacts derived
from the Ouachita Mountains to include, most commonly, boatstones and beads,
followed by single reports of a gorget, celt, and adze.
The presence of marine shell ornaments in the Cunningham-Gray collection
is consistent with findings made at a number of other sites in the region, including Albert George (Walley 1955), Ernest Witte (Hall 1981), and Crestmont
(Vernon 1989). Further afield are sites such as 41BX1 (Lukowski 1988) and the
Texas West Indies Ranch site (Birmingham and Huebner 1991). In all of these
cases, the shells were found as inclusions in Late Archaic graves. The outline
shapes and patterns of perforations represented in the Cunningham-Gray specimens are most like specimens found at the Ernest Wite site (Hall 1981). As
previously mentioned, a gulf coastal source in Alabama or Florida has been
suggested for the marine shell ornaments showing up in the Late Archaic cemeteries of Southeast Texas (Hall 1981:222, 306; Steele 1988:238).
The Cunningham-Gray collection lends support to certain of the trends in
the material culture previously recognized for the prehistory of Southeast Texas.
It has chipped stone diagnostics indicating a long sequence of prehistoric cultural activity in the area. The ground stone adze and celt, and the marine shell
ornaments, provide additional evidence of participation in an exchange network,
~robably most active during the Late Archaic period, that linked the prehistoric
inhabitants of this region ultimately to distant raw material resource areas in
Arkansas and perhaps even farther to the northeast in Alabama or Florida.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I thank the property owner and the individuals in possession of the artifact
collection described here for their cooperation in permitting site survey activities
and documentation of the specimens. The assistance that Joe Hudgins gave me in
surveying the collection recovery area was greatly appreciated. I also thank Dr.
Robert Folk for his identifications of the rock types used to make the ground
stone artifacts.
