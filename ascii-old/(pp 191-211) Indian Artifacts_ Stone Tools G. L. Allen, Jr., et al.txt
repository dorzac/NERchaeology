In this section the stone artifacts other than guifltints and stone
pipes are described. They are separated into seven categories on
the basis of assumed function: projectile points, scrapers, knives,
celts, manos, hammerstones, and abrading stones. When appropriate,
each category is subdivided into smaller groups of similar specimens.
Arrow points and scrapers make up the bulk of the lithie assemblage.
Two major divisions of projectile points are recognized: dart points
and arrow points. Dart points are larger and heavier than arrow
points. Scrapers are divided into two principal groups: end scrapers
and side scrapers.

Illustrations: Figure 68, a-g
These points are shaped like simple triangles. The lateral edges
are usually straight. They may be slightly convex but are never coneave. The bases are normally straight although a few specimens have
slightly to moderately eoneave bases. As a general rule these points
are thin and we!l made with over-all biracial flaking. Occasionally,
however, a thin, flat, conveniently shaped flake was merely retouched along the edges. All but two of the Fresno points are made
from chert or other fine eryptocrystalline quartz material. The two
exceptions are made from quartzite.
Measurements: length, range 15 to 39 mm., average 23.4 ram.;
width, range 9 to 21 mm., average 13.8 mm. These averages are
based on measurements of 131 complete points. The size distributions
are presented graphically in Figure 69.

Remarks: It is worth noting that 83go of the 49. identifiable dart
points are made from a quartzite available in the immediate area of
the Gilbert Site. In sharp contrast to the dart points, only 2.8~o of the
181 arrow points were made of this loeal material. Three of the
arrow points made of loeally available material-the Catahoula and
eontraeting stem points-seem to belong to an older oeeupation than
the historic one. The use of finer imported material for the triangular
points of the historic occupation is probably one result of the
greater mobility of these people after they acquired horses.
SCRAPERS

Illustrations: Figures 70 and 71
Several different people worked on the scrapers, and-not too
surprisingly-the result was four different classifications of end scrapers. Descriptions of all four classifications follow.
In one study, the end scrapers were sorted into categories of the
"outline" classification used by Duttleld and Jelks (1961: 9.4-28) in
their report on the Pearson Site. Their categories are:
"Tapering Base Snub-nose Scrapers. This form is elongated, is

198

TEXAS AlqCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

widest at the bit end, and tapers from the bit end to a pointed base
Â¯ . . the working edge is straight to slightly convex.
"Rounded Base Snub-nose Scrapers. These differ from the above
group in that the bases are rounded and are of approximately the
same width, if not wider, than the working edge. Some, however, are
slightly narrower at the base than at the bit. The lateral edges do not
taper, but are approximately parallel.
"Subtriangular Snub-nose Scrapers. This form is basically triangular
in shape, with strongly convex edges. The lateral edges are slightly
longer th~in the working edge, and they taper down to a rounded,
or sometimes flattened, base.
"Straight Base Snub-nose Scrapers. The characteristic attribute of
this group is a straight base which may sometimes have resulted from
accidental breakage. The cutting edge is usually convex but may occasionally be straight. The lateral edges are approximately parallel,
although they occasionally taper slightly toward the base.
"Rectangular Snub-nose Scrapers . . . are rectangular in shape.
"Triangular End Scrapers or Gouges. These implements are characterized by their small size, triangular outline, and by a steeply beveled,
straight to slightly convex working edge. One face of these tools is
considerably flatter than the other."
When the Gilbert Site end scrapers were sorted into the above
groups, the following counts were obtained: tapering base, 170;
rounded base, 44; straight base, 146; rectangular base, 28; triangular
base, 30.
The same group of snub-nose scrapers was also classified using a
"method of manufacture" system similar to that used by Suhm (1962:
69) in her study of scrapers from the Footbridge Site at Canyon
Reservoir. She divided the scrapers into three groups: (1) initial
cortex flake scrapers, (2) cortex flake scrapers, and (3) secondalT
flake scrapers.
Initial cortex flake scrapers "are fashioned from the initial or outermost flakes detached from chert nodules . . . with the convex or
âoutsideâ surface retaining large portions of the cortex . . . most,
but not all, were struck from cores with prepared striking platforms."
Cortex flake scrapers "are derived from chert nodules after the
removal of the initial flake and, therefore, have a positive bulb of
percussion on one face and a negative bulb on the other. All, however, still retain portions of the cortex."
Secondary flake scrapers "are made from flakes which lack any
traces of cortex."
The counts using this system were: initia] cortex, 38; cortex, 136;

INDIAN

AI~TIFACTS

"199

secondary flakes, 216; total, 390. The 28 small snub-nose scrapers
were not included in these totals.
A third classification system was devised by one analyst. It is based
on the outline of the cross section just behind the scraping edge as
seen from a "nose-on" view. It is believed that such a cross-section
analysis would reflect whether the scraper was intended for heavy,
medium, or light duty scraping. It might also indicate whether the
scraper was halted to increase its efficiency.
The results using this system were: heavy dorsal rib, 69; medium
dorsal rib, 170; shallow arc, 69; flat dorsal plane, 110.
These classifications are all descriptive approaches to the problem
of end-scraper analysis and leave much to be desired as to functional
categories. End scrapers have been a matter of archeological record
over many areas and time periods although very few good descriptions
are found in the literature. It is our belief that a more refined methodof-manufacture system might offer some basic insight into the problem
if the following assumptions are valid.
This type of scraper is essentially a utility tool of everyday use,
probably a tool for working hides and leather. There are indications that some forms were hafted to increase the leverage and consequent utility or efficiency of the tool. Evidence of this is the
greater percentage of basal breakage on the scrapers with flat dorsal
faces.

Assmning these are normally utility tools, they would be made, as
needed, from the most convenient material at hand. They would be
prepared on the march, during the hunt, or in camp. For the same
reason, they would be discarded readily as seems indicated by their
wide distribution but relatively light concentration.
A technological or method-of-manufacture analysis of the Gilbert
end scrapers similar to the system used to describe Old World lithic
industries follows. Since many of the terms used by European typologists are unfamiliar to Americanists, they are defined in a glossary.
GLOSSARY

Flake The segment of rock broken off when a core is struck
properly.
Blade A flake which is at least twice as long as it is wide.
Core A piece of rock from whicb flakes are intentionally removed.
Strikin~ Platform The surface of a core which receives the blow
when a flake is struck off. Part of the striking platform usually remains on the proximal end of the flake as it breaks away.
Proximal End The end closest to a given point or to the user.
The bulb of percussion is at the proximal end of a flake.

the distal end of the flake without any modification to the lateral
edges or the proximal end. The size range for these tools is small.
Examination of the flakes indicates a prepared-core technology. The
core was prepared to yield a flake within a predetermined and accepted size range which required no modifications to any surface
but the distal end.

touch of at least one lateral flake edge to form a tool suitable for use
as a scraper. Most of them are made on flakes but thirteen are on
blades.
The sizes and shapes of the flake scrapers are quite diverse. Most
have one retouched edge with no additional modification of the flake.
Eight, however, have two adjacent retouched edges (Fig. 72, b, d).
Most have straight or slightly convex bits but 18 are concave. These
latter are commonly called spokeshaves or notches.
The 13 side scrapers made on blades (Fig. 72, e, e) are long, thin
flakes that were struck from a core by direct or indirect percussion.
The backs of the blades usually have longitudinal ridges from removal of previous flakes in the same direction. In cross section the
blades are essentially piano-convex although they occasionally curve
slightly from end to end. The blades are modified by retoueh.

A knife may be described as an artifact with at least one bifacially
retouched edge suitable for cutting. There is no uniformity in size
or shape of the Gilbert Site knives. In general, the workmanship is
crude. One appears to be a medial portion of a Harahey or alternately beveled, diamond-shaped knife. Sixteen of these specimens
are made on blades.
There are fewer stone knives in the collection than might be expected probably due to the importance of metal trade knives in the

These are flakes with a natural subtriangular outline which are retouched along one relatively long corner to form a stout point. They
are not otherwise modified. Such tools would be suitable for drilling
or boring wood, bone, or soft stone.

show wear from use.
DEBITACE

No. of Specimens: 1,441
Provenience: Feature 1 (27), Feature 9. (14), Feature 3 (538), Feature 4 (204), Feature 5 (218), Feature 6 (9,27), Feature 7 (67), Feature 10 (9), Feature 11 (8), Feature 13 (2), Feature 15 (70), Feature 16 (39), surface (18)
Debitage is any waste material produced during the manufacture
of artifacts. This category includes core fragments, extremely small
flakes resulting from retouch and sharpening, and all unretouched
flakes.
The debitage was sorted according to the type of stone and tabulated. Identification of stone from non-local sources is assumed to be
evSdenee of trade.
Quartzite, sandstone, and petrified wood occur in the local vicinity and are combined in Table 9 under the heading Local Materials.
Types of stone of known origin are Kay County flint which comes
from quarries in north-central Oklahoma and is easily identifiable by
the inclnsions of small fossils, fusilinids; Central Texas flint occurs as
nodules or ledges in limestone outcrops throughout the Edwards
Plateau; Alibates flint, a silicified dolomite from the Texas Panhandle;
and novaculite which occurs in Arkansas.
CELTS

No. of Specimens: 2
Provenience: Feature Â£ (1), Feature 6 (1)
Illustrations: Figure 73, d-e
The entire surface of these celts with the exception of the bit shows
evidence of the pecking and light grinding which was used to shape
the artifacts. The bits are ground smooth into sharp convex edges. The
cross sections are oval. The material is a dense, fine-grained, black,
igneous rock.
Measurements: Specimen l-length 84 mm., width, 45 mm.; Specimen 2-length 89 mm., width, 49 ram.

These quartzite cobbles have battered edges. It is assumed they
were used as hammerstones in flint knapping.
MANOS

No. of Specimens: 1
Provenience: Feature 9.0
Ilhtstrations: Figure 73, f
This is a thick, well shaped, subround, quartzite mano with two
fiat grinding surfaces. Each grinding surface has small, shallow,
pecked depressions in the center.
Measurements: length, 96 ram.; width, 86 ram.; thickness, 59. ram.
SANDSTONE

ABRADERS

No. of Specimens: 46
Provenience: Feature 1 (13), Feature 3 (14), Feature 4 (8), Feature 5 (5), Feature 6 (4), Feature 7 (9.)
Illustrations: Figure 73, a-c
Twenty-one of these artifacts are loaf-shaped, rectangular pieces
the friable sandstone with a deep, longitudinal, U-shaped groove on
the flattest side. Eyewitness accounts by early explorers indicate
that this type of artifact was used to smooth anâow shafts (La Flesche,
199.4: 113).
Eleven other specimens have one deep U-shaped shaft-smoothing
groove with additional smaller, shallower, V-shaped grooves on other
surfaces which could have been used to smooth and sharpen awls,
needles, or other narrow tools.
One very large block of sandstone has one large, smooth whetting
surface and two flat faces. Numerous randomly oriented cuts probably resulted from use as an anvil. The fact that this specimen was
found in the bottom of the pit in Feature 6 lends credence to the
theory that the pit was a storage pit.
Fourteen specimens are considered to be hones because they have
flat, smoothed surfaces suitable for sharpening relatively straight-edged
blades such as metal knives, hatchets, wedges, and stone celts.
PITTED STONES

No. of Specimens: 1
Provenience: Feature 3
This triangular piece of sandstone has a shallow pit in the center
of each face.

Pieces of yellow and red ocher occurred throughout the site. There
were scratch marks on some pieces where the pigment had been
scraped off, evidently for use as paint.
