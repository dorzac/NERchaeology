Introduction
At the request of the Texas Historical Commission, selected ceramic analyses of the George C. Davis
(41CE19) ceramic assemblage were conducted to obtain analytical data to identify Early Caddo ceramics
in Central Texas sites possibly occupied by Prairie Caddo peoples (see Shafer 2007). The George C.
Davis site is in the Neches River basin in the East Texas Pineywoods (Figure 1), and is a large multiple
mound center and associated settlement occupied by ancestral Caddo peoples primarily between ca. A.D.
800-1300.

Figure 1. The location of the George C. Davis site in the East Texas Pineywoods.
Shafer (2007:26) lists several “analytical steps” that should be conducted that relate directly to the
Davis site in this regard: (1) conduct instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of a sample of
Davis site pottery for a baseline comparison for early Caddo pottery from Central Texas; (2) conduct
petrographic analysis of Davis site pottery to establish a baseline comparison for early Caddo pottery
from Central Texas; and (3) determine vessel size through rim and body sherd diameters from the Davis
site pottery using a graduated chart. This report concerns analytical steps (1), (2), and (3), and constitutes
a technical report that summarizes the various findings from these selected analyses.

Specialized Ceramic Analyses of the George C. Davis Site (41CE19) Ceramic Assemblage

Step 1, Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis
University of Missouri Research Reactor and Timothy K. Perttula
There is an extensive INAA database on the chemical composition of Caddo sherds (1400+) from
East Texas and surrounding states, along with a number of important technical reports on Caddo INAA
(Perttula and Ferguson 2010; Perttula and Selden 2013; Trubitt et al. 2016). This included 50 sherds
analyzed in 2003 by INAA from the WPA ceramic collections at the George C. Davis site (Descantes
et al. 2003, 2005). These sherds (UT 495-544) were from six of the defined ceramic types at the site
(Descantes et al. 2005:Table 5), namely Crockett Curvilinear Incised (n=5), Davis Incised (n=10),
Dunkin Incised (n=10), Holly Fine Engraved (n=10), Pennington Punctated-Incised (n=5), and Weches
Fingernail Impressed (n=10). For this study, Perttula selected 25 sherds from the other recognized wares
at the site, including Free Punctates (TKP 1025-1026, 1028-1032), Duren Neck Banded (TKP 10331040), Grooved (TKP 1041-1045), Bowles Creek Plain (TKP 1046-1049) (see Newell and Krieger 1949),
and a plain bottle sherd (TKP 1027), to insure that all Early Caddo ceramic wares from the site have
been sampled for INAA. INAA, in conjunction with ceramic petrographic analysis of the sherds already
analyzed by INAA (see Step 3, below), will provide clues on resource localities for ceramic making and
possible trade/transport of fine wares at the George C. Davis site.
INAA of the 25 sherds was conducted by the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR)
following now standard chemical compositional analyses (Bishop et al. 1982; Glascock 1992). MURR
prepare a table that reports the chemical values of 33 rare earth elements represented in the 25 sherds
(Table 1). These results build on the earlier work by Descantes et al. (2003, 2005) concerning the
chemical character of the ceramics from the George C. Davis site (Table 2) and the recognition of distinct
regional chemical groups in East Texas defined by Perttula and Ferguson (2010).
Previous analyses of sherds from the George C. Davis site, as well as INAA samples from a number
of other sites in East Texas, has led to the division of the database, using bivariate plots of different
chemical elements (particularly antimony, arsenic, chromium, cesium, hafnium, iron, lutetium, titanium,
thorium, and vanadium), into a number of core chemical groups in certain sub-regions (Groups 1, 2,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 core groups for those numbered sub-regions), as well as subsidiary chemical groups
within certain sub-regions (Group 4-1, 6-1, 7-1, 8-1, 8-2, 9-1, 9-2, 11-1, 11-2, and 11-3) (Ferguson 2010).
Groups 3 and 10 have very small sample sizes, and no specific sub-regional core groupings or subsidiary
chemical groups have been defined for these sub-regions (see Figure 2).
The INAA sherds from the George C. Davis site (site 23 on Figure 2) are included in the Group 9
core, which includes primarily sites from the Neches and Angelina river basins in Cherokee, Houston,
Rusk, San Augustine, and Shelby counties. Biplots of chromium (CR) and cesium (CE) were used
to separate the Region 9 core from Region 9, Groups 1 and 2. Ferguson (2010:7) concluded that the
ceramics in the Region 9 core “are made primarily from chemically-similar and widely available alluvial
clays,” in the case of the George C. Davis site vessels, almost certainly the alluvial clays of the Neches
River and its principal tributary, Bowles Creek.
The principal elements in the clay paste of each of the ceramic sherds from the George C. Davis site
are cesium (CE), iron (FE), aluminum (AL), potassium (K), and titanium (TI) (see Tables 1 and 2). The
parts per million values for chromium range from 51.0249-103.046 in the UT INAA sherds and from
58.6833-91.8526 in the present sample of sherds, and the values for cesium range from 1.5405-6.4571 in
the UT sample and 1.4705-4.1393 in the present sample; the samples have virtually the same chemical
parameters. Nevertheless, comparing the chemical values of the sherds in Tables 1 and 2 from each of
the defined ceramic types in the overall INAA sample it is apparent that there are chemical variations

between them—particularly between the sherds from Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Pennington
Punctated-Incised vessels and the other types—implying that different sources of local clay were used for
the plain wares, utility wares, and fine wares manufactured at the George C. Davis site.

Step 2, Determining Vessel Size
through Rim Diameter Measurements
Timothy K. Perttula
Vessel size data from the determination of rim orifice diameters in the George C. Davis ceramic
assemblage are based on the analysis of 500 rim sherds in the collections of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin, including 200 rims from fine ware (i.e., engraved
and slipped) vessels from different vessel forms, 200 rims from utility ware (wet paste designs), and 100
from plain ware vessels. Vessel size and volume data from the analysis of the 47 vessels in the George C.
Davis ceramic assemblage (Perttula 2016a) has also been employed to supplement the rim data.
The fine ware sherds include five rim sherds from engraved bottles and 195 from carinated bowls
and bowls. The mean orifice diameter of the bottle sherds is 8.00 + 1.20 cm, with a range of 5-10 cm, and
22.74 + 4.36 cm (range 9-34 cm) for the fine ware carinated bowls and bowls.
Utility ware rim sherds have a mean orifice diameter of 23.1 + 4.92 cm. The orifice diameter range is
11-38 cm.
Plain rims from bottles in the George C. Davis ceramic assemblage have a mean orifice diameter of
6.63 + 1.63 cm (range 5-10 cm), slightly smaller than the engraved bottles. The mean orifice diameter
of rims from plain bowls, carinated bowls, and jars is 17.4 + 3.75 cm (range 9-31 cm), indicating that
generally the plain vessels are smaller than the utility ware jars or the fine ware carinated bowls and
bowls.
In the vessels from village habitation and burial features on one of the mounds at the George C.
Davis site (see Perttula 2016a), the mean diameter of carinated bowls (including both engraved fine
wares (n=7) and Pennington Punctated-Incised vessels (n=4) is 26.6 + 6.0 cm (range 11.5-43.2 cm).
The one compound bowl in the vessel collection has an orifice diameter of 25.4 cm. Fine ware bottles
(n=6) have a mean orifice diameter of 5.2 + 2.3 cm, with a range of 2.5-10.2 cm. Utility ware jars (n=9)
have a mean orifice diameter of 12.1 + 2.9 cm (range 7.4-15.7 cm), and bowls (n=11) have a mean
orifice diameter of 15.4 + 4.9 cm (range 3.7-35.4 cm). The bowls in the collection include three plain
ware (range 11.6-19.2 cm), six fine ware (range 3.7-18.2 cm), and two utility ware (range 15.8-35.4 cm)
vessels. In general, rim sherds from habitation contexts are from larger vessels than those in special
feature and/or burial contexts, except for carinated bowls, which are about 18 percent larger in special
feature and/or burial contexts than they are general habitation areas.

Step 3, Petrographic Analysis
The ceramic petrographic analysis focuses on 72 ceramic sherds from defined ceramic types at the
George C. Davis site. The first 47 sherds for petrographic analysis are the sherd section remaining from
the sample of defined types (i.e., Holly Fine Engraved, Weches Fingernail Impressed, Davis Incised,
Dunkin Incised, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, and Pennington Punctated Incised) that have already
received INAA (Descantes et al. 2005; Perttula 2016b). The remaining 25 sherds have been selected from
other recognized wares at the site, including Free Punctates, Duren Neck Banded, Grooved, and Bowles
Creek Plain (see Newell and Krieger 1949).
The ceramic petrographic methods to be used are those pioneered in archeology by Shepard
(1942, 1976), with minor refinements since then (Bishop et al. 1989; Childs 1989; Orton et al. 1993;
Quinn 2013; Stoltman 2015). The petrographic work was done at the Microscopy Lab at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin. A further research benefit of
this ceramic petrographic work will be the creation of an Early Caddo ceramic compositional database
that can be linked up with other ancestral Caddo databases now emerging (Barkwill-Love 2012;
Robinson 2016; Robinson and Perttula 2015). This may allow a picture of Caddo ceramic technological
trajectories.

Ceramic Petrographic Analysis of Prehistoric Pottery
from the George C. Davis Site (41CE19),
Cherokee County, East Texas
David Glen Robinson
Introduction
Seventy-two ceramic vessel sherds excavated from the George C. Davis site (41CE19; Newell
and Krieger 1949) have been examined by ceramic petrographic analysis for this study. The original
sherds were also sampled for Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) by the Missouri
University Research Reactor (see Step 2, this report). This combination of approaches is part of a
change in Northeast Texas ceramic technological studies termed a second generation by some (Robinson
2014), although such multiple combined approaches have long been advocated and applied in general
archeological literature (Orton et al. 1993:144-148). The approach looks at the geochemical and
petrological characteristics of ceramics in tandem to gain a broader and more informative understanding
of the character of ancient pottery. This study is the petrographic branch of the overall approach as
applied to a sample of the ceramic sherds from the George C. Davis site, also known as Caddo Mounds
State Historic Site. The objective here is to gain clues or suggestions on local, community, and regional
scales of Caddo ceramic production and distribution, as well as to establish a ceramic petrographic
baseline for the ceramics recovered at the George C. Davis as a means to identify ceramic vessels
originating there that are present in other parts of East Texas and Central Texas. Part of this effort is to
attempt to identify localities and types of clay beds used in ceramic manufacture at the site.
Methods
The petrographic analysis of the Caddo pottery sherds was accomplished by thin section analysis,
pioneered in archeology by Shepard (1942, 1976). Identification and point counting were conducted
on an Olympus stereo petrographic, polarizing light, microscope with a rotating stage at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin (TARL). After the various
minerals, rocks, and other discernible bodies in the thin sections were identified with confidence, a
point count was made of each thin section. The slide was traversed at approximate 0.5 mm intervals,
and every body falling directly in the center of the field of view was counted; traverses continued until a
count of 200 was achieved or the area of the slide was fully covered. The procedure follows the original
method of Chayes (1949). The clay body, all solid inclusions and pore spaces, or voids, were included
in the counts as they all comprise the paste pattern of the ceramics. In all mechanically consistent
processes such as point counting, rare and unrepresentative (but potentially significant) phenomena may
fail to enter the sample or not have been counted. When rare minerals were observed but did not enter
the point count, they were entered on the tabulation sheet as ‘tr.’ for trace. In this way, their presence
and contribution were noted without violating the consistency of the point count. The outcome of the
point count is a quantified assessment of the collection’s ceramic attributes, a body of data amenable
to comparisons with other similarly gained data, and subject to manipulation by a variety of statistical
measures (Table 3).

Specialized Ceramic Analyses of the George C. Davis Site (41CE19) Ceramic Assemblage

The lengthy table of point-counted mineral and rock characteristics follows at the end of this
section of the report (see Table 11).
The goal stated above, to identify localities and types of clay beds used in ceramic vessel
manufacture at the George C. Davis site requires background geological research to establish a
comparative base for the identifications. Accordingly, the geological literature on East Texas was
examined to find mineral and geomorphological patterns that may address the issues of ceramic materials
at and near the George C. Davis site.
Geological background
The George C. Davis site sits on fluviatile terrace gravels (Qt) bounded by Quaternary alluvium to
the west toward the Neches River. Nearby to the north and east lie deposits of the Eocene Queen City
Sand (Eqc). Farther out to the north, east, and southeast, but within a mile of the site, lie exposures of the
Eocene Weches (Ew) and Sparta Sand (Es) formations. The Queen City and Sparta sands are terrestrial or
near-shore formations, while the Weches is marine in origin. All these formations are formed principally
of quartz sand and glauconitic clays with common clay ironstone and limonitic strata. The clays weather
to red, yellow, and brown layers with abundant iron (Bureau of Economic Geology 1993).
Clay minerals
Clay deposits of ceramic-making quality in East Texas are those comprised mostly of kaolinite,
followed in importance by montmorillonite and illite. The kaolinitic clays are most common in the
Wilcox (ERwi) Group, and the Queen City and Sparta Sands (Fisher 1965:85). Important modern
research and sampling of the regional clays is worth quoting:
The principal clay mineral of ceramic clays in East Texas is kaolinite. Most also contain a
small amount of montmorillonite or illite. Clays in the area contain varying amounts of
quartz in the form of free silica and iron in the form of oxides. Relatively small amounts of
muscovite, zircon, rutile, tourmaline, and magnetite are common in most samples (Fisher
1965:85).
Fisher’s resident mineral list includes minerals common in the current study collection. Fisher (1965:85)
continues: “Owing chiefly to the presence of iron, either as an accessory mineral or as an essential
component in the clay structure, most East Texas clays fire to shades of red or red brown.” He states
further that lighter firing clays (creams, gray, and buffs) are found in counties to the south, east, and
northeast of Cherokee County and the Neches River drainage (Fisher 1965:5).
These materials likely formed the common sources of clays, quartz sands, and iron oxides found
in the clay ceramic matrixes of the George C. Davis site ceramic collection examined in this study. It
is notable, too, that the geological setting may have provided numerous residual, terrigenous, beds of
ceramic quality clays in addition to alluvial clay deposits in the alluvium and fluviatile terrace gravels of
the Neches River and tributary streams (such as nearby Bowles Creek). The minerals in them establish a
baseline for identifying the local paste groups of the study collection.
Quartz
Different forms of quartz have differing processes of petrogenesis. This study observes to the
extent possible the different forms of quartz that have varying identifiable rock origins. Several quartz
classifications exist. This study applies one synthesized by Folk (1980:69-72), which retains sensitivity
to petrogenesis. The units of the classification are: (1) Common or plutonic; (2) Volcanic; (3) Vein; (4)
Recrystallized metamorphic; (5) Schistose; and (6) Sheared (Stretched Metamorphic Quartz). Quartz

Specialized Ceramic Analyses of the George C. Davis Site (41CE19) Ceramic Assemblage 19
types found in the George C. Davis ceramic sherd study collection include only common or plutonic
quartz, vein quartz, and recrystallized metamorphic quartz, termed here composite quartz. The common
and vein types are formed from magmas, as well as near-surface crystallization from silica-rich aqueous
solutions, and those types in the collection have probably existed under surface conditions for great
lengths of time. Almost all the observed particles showed straight extinction, lacking undulose extinction,
indicating few episodes of strain on the grains during their surface tenure. The minor proportions of
recrystallized metamorphic quartz in the collection reflect recrystallization after geologic episodes of
shear or strain on beds in which they were resident. As these grains are mixed with those of the other
types in the collection, those strained or metamorphosed beds are now untraceable due to erosion and
redeposition. But as with all the minor minerals, the presence or absence of this form of composite
quartz, may, with other mineral telltales, indicate distinctions among clay resource localities.
Quartz temper is quite common in the George C. Davis ceramic collection. For the purposes of this
study, it may be called a temper if the particles are of medium sand sizes and larger. The traditional term
sand temper is not used because the traditional use admits varying mineralogies. Petrography seeks to
isolate varying mineralogies such as feldspar, etc. Another complication is the use of the size category
“sand” in the standard Wentworth classification. Any particle falling into the category is sand. This study
uses the term for the purpose of size description, and not to imply any mineralogy. A partial exception
to this practice is use of the term “sandy paste pottery,” which is an established and traditional term
for certain classes of pottery found on ancestral Caddo sites in parts of East Texas, as well as sites in
Southeast Texas and the upper Texas Coast. The use of the term is as much typological as descriptive,
and calling it by another term would only sow confusion.
Silt
Almost all clay beds contain a silt-sized fraction of particles in varying proportions. These
proportions are commonly reflected in ceramic sherds because the silt fraction is difficult to remove
completely in ceramic manufacture. Under the microscope, the internal mineralogy of the silt fraction is
difficult to determine other than by rotating the stage to observe extinction, common to many silt-forming
minerals, especially quartz. Quartz silt is assumed to be present in the study collection; it is the free
silica in regional clay deposits alluded to by Fisher (1965:85). Silt particles were point-counted when
seen and also described proportionally by comparison to a set of visual standards (Bennett 1974). Shapes
ranged from very angular, through angular, sub-angular, and sub-rounded, with poor and moderate
sorting. Masses of rounded silt particles implying stream-rolled deposits were not observed.
Iron
The various forms of iron mentioned above in the geological background section are common in the
study collection. Their origins and localities are explained amply for ceramic study purposes by noting
the 20th century mining of iron ores in the Weches (Ew) formation at several localities in Cherokee,
Morris, Cass, and Nacogdoches counties in East Texas, and other counties transected by the formation.
The principal ore is limonite (Fisher 1965:287).
Ilmenite
The mineral is commonly found with iron oxide and formularized either as TiO2 or FeTiO3. As
titanium dioxide, the material also forms the crystalline mineral rutile. Any of the allomorphic forms of
ilmenite may be found in the clay deposits of the region as heavy minerals (any mineral with a specific
gravity greater than 2.85). Concentrations of ilmenite minerals and the heavy minerals as a class are not
great enough for modern mining in East Texas (Fisher 1965:201; Hurlbut and Klein 1977:263, 271273). The Queen City Sand (Eqc) is the most significant ilmenite-bearing formation in the general study
area. As minor minerals in clay pastes, the presence or absence of ilmenite and the other heavy minerals

20

may indicate differences in source beds of the clays in the pottery. Given its association with iron, it is
grouped with iron forms in this study.
Carbonates
Limestones, marls, and chalks have multiple abundant outcroppings in the Cretaceous Navarro
(K, Cretaceous undivided) and Taylor (K) groups and the Paleocene Midway Group (Rmi). Their
outcroppings nearest to the George C. Davis site are in the Butler, Palestine, and Keechi salt domes.
All the domes lie in the Trinity River drainage more than 30 miles west and northwest of the site. The
deposits erode and the river drains the carbonates southward and away from the Neches River basin.
Thus, carbonates are not expected to be present in the local alluvium. Elsewhere in the region, carbonate
rocks outcrop well to the north in Red River, Lamar, and Van Zandt counties and to the southwest in
Limestone County (Bureau of Economic Geology 1993; Fisher 1965:288). Carbonates are exceedingly
rare in the study collection. A single grain of calcite was observed in one thin section (see Table 11).
Igneous rocks
Volcanic minerals, especially feldspar and tuff, occur in the ceramic collection as minor mineral
suites in a few sections. Volcanic minerals are not local to the George C. Davis site, but they are found in
ceramics in the South Sulphur River drainage (Iruegas 1999:279-290). The actual source beds may lie in
the Cretaceous formations of North Texas and Southwest Arkansas (Bureau of Economic Geology 1979).
They are also expected in the alluvial terraces of the Red River, which drains a very large area with many
igneous sources and features.
Micas
Muscovite and biotite are common members of the mica group of minerals. They are abundant
constituents of larger grained igneous rocks such as granite and pegmatite, and they form in mixed
deposits as alteration products of these rocks, and of clay minerals as well. Various clay strata of the
Weches (Ew), Queen City (Eqc), Sparta Sand (Es), and Recklaw (Er) formations are described as
micaceous (Bureau of Economic Geology 1993). Muscovite is common in the pastes of the sherds in the
George C. Davis ceramic collection, while biotite is rare.
Bioclasts
Bioclasts are modern or fossil animal or plant parts in a rock, mineral, or ceramic thin section. They
are most common as fossil marine organisms in carbonates. Modern organic materials in sedimentary
deposits include plant parts, roots, worm casts, invertebrate egg cases, and snail and mussel shell
fragments. Charcoal is technically a bioclast and may have been introduced into ceramic pastes by
natural or cultural means. Brush fires may leave charcoal in deposits, and village cooking and warming
fires may distribute charcoal into clay materials incidentally. Charcoal is not suitable as a temper because
it is too soft, but other intentional uses of carbon in ceramics may have been employed by Caddo potters.
During the analysis, it was noted that some of the thin sections contained relatively large amounts of
woody, blackened strands in voids. Many of those voids, of varying shapes, had black rims around them.
Elongated voids more than 2 mm long were formed by sticks that burned out, leaving the long, open
shape of the void. A few such burned-out voids were circular or oval, as though a stick perpendicular to
the plane of the section had burned away, leaving a circular or oval void. After several instances of this
situation were noted, the subject voids were point-counted and described as “woody burnout” to entertain
the possibility that woody bits, sticks, and charcoal were introduced to the clay paste deliberately to add
carbon to the pastes. This may have been practiced for the purpose of darkening the ceramic and not, to
repeat, to add a form of temper.

Specialized Ceramic Analyses of the George C. Davis Site (41CE19) Ceramic Assemblage 21
This manufacturing technique may also have been employed in addition to the technique of imposing
a reduction atmosphere during firing. The overall idea is that at ceramic firing temperatures the organic
material would volatilize and migrate as gas through the paste as part of the general process of outgassing
of compounds found in all ceramics and released as gases during firing (most of the gas is water vapor).
The carbon compounds would combine with other molecules of ceramic material until the process ceased
with the cooling of the newly fired vessel. The reduction atmosphere, if it were imposed, would inhibit
molecules from forming oxides, commonly lighter in color in earthen materials. The intent of both
techniques may have been to produce a darker finished ceramic. Results in the collection were not uniform
in this regard, however, as some lighter-colored pastes also had woody burnout voids. It should be stressed
that both the accidental and deliberate processes of adding charcoal and carbon to ceramic pastes are not
contradictory, and both could have taken place in any Caddo ceramic piece. Carbon particles do not burn
out completely in many cases, thus leaving to observation the clues to their origins.
Bioclastic shell, either snail or bivalve, may appear in deposits as eroded pieces of varying sizes and
often are rounded or sub-rounded in appearance. As a hypothesis, bioclastic shell in clay deposits may
be more common in alluvial clay deposits where they may be relatively fresh, their presence having been
renewed by continuing fluvial action. Residual deposits by contrast may have relatively little bioclastic
shell by reason of a lack of sources (aquatic habitats) for the material and greater available time for the
erosion and decomposition of the shell resident in the deposit. For the purposes of this study, bioclastic
shell is considered a telltale of probable alluvial clay sources versus residual, terrigenous, clay beds.
Bone in amounts and sizes too small to have served as temper may have entered clay pastes
incidentally as ambient particles from village surfaces. Unfired ceramic vessels must dry in air from a
few to several days to prepare them for firing and any pre-firing decoration, if any. They may pick up
particles from the ground on which they sit, as with charcoal. Arnold (1985:66-70 and Table 3.1) charted
a worldwide ethnographic sample of reported ceramic drying times or pre-firing. The times ranged from
one day to 20 days, or “several weeks.” In many cases, drying batches are moved one or more times
to avoid extremes of temperature, sunlight, and precipitation, with the potters acknowledging that any
move leaves ceramics at risk of breakage and damage. The incorporation of foreign particles on pre-fired
vessels may also be a source of marring damage.
Grog, mixed pastes, and clay masses
Grog is ground or crushed ceramic vessel sherds added to ceramic pastes as temper. This is a
specialized term, and it is used only in this sense in this study. As many as six types of grog were found
in the George C. Davis sherds examined in this study:
1.

Dark red to black clay with dense medium and coarse silt particles. Particles poorly sorted,
some fine sand-sized;

2.

Grayish-brown, sometimes almost purplish, clay with dense angular and sub-angular fine
sand particles. The mass also contains fine sand-rounded hematite particles;

3.

Yellowish-brown clay with poorly sorted coarse silt and fine sand, with sub-rounded and
angular silt particles. The clay is extremely micaceous with silt-sized rods of muscovite
mica that render the clay anisotropic, or “mobile,” in cross-polarized light (abbreviated as
“xpl” in Table 11). Small crystal structures in the clay or fine mica mixture appear to move
slightly as the rotating stage is turned, changing the particles’ orientation to the light.

4.

Bright orange-red clay with well-rounded and well-sorted fine sand-sized silt. The shapes
and masses of this type are uniformly configured with well-rounded and well-sorted
particles, and this grog type is the one most likely to have had an alluvial clay bed or point
bar source;

22

Specialized Ceramic Analyses of the George C. Davis Site (41CE19) Ceramic Assemblage
5.

Gray-green clay with dense, poorly sorted angular silt. These bodies, sometimes as large as
very coarse sand-sized particles, often have one or two nearly straight sides and the look of
irregular polygons. Vertices are rounded, however, and sometimes one or two sides appear
incomplete and blended into the neighboring clay masses. The clay is slightly anisotropic in
cross-polarized light (xpl) view; and

6.

Black hematite-rounded masses with low density, and with scattered angular and very
angular quartz silt.

Other minor clay mass types that escaped observation may exist in the collection. Those described here
are very common, with their traits consistent throughout the various thin sections. For the sake of brevity
in presentation, they are referred to in the section descriptions as the number of their types in the mixed
clay pastes and are not described repetitively in the text.
In addition to grog, the clays showing in the thin sections had strips and patches of different colored
clays and materials. Sections with these traits were described as mixed pastes in recording. The colors,
silts, and other traits of the clay masses varied considerably across the sections. They are in contrast to
the unitary pastes that have a more uniform look in addition to their various voids and aplastic inclusions.
Unitary pastes look like one type of ceramic-making clay throughout.
Results
The clay pastes in the collection in large degree reflect the iron-rich landscape of Cherokee County
and its Eocene geologic formations. The 72 ceramic specimens were divided among six distinctive paste
groups. All the specimens contained silt quartz, free silica, common throughout East Texas area. The
two major paste groups, A and B, have quartz tempering with abundant mixed iron types. Silt quartz is
distinguished from quartz temper by size class, primarily, and differences in rounding/angularity. Sand
temper may contain mineralogies other than quartz; the term “sand temper” is avoided in this study for
the sake of greater precision. Traditional analysts may use the terms synonymously, but should remain
aware of the difference. The mixed clay pastes dominated the sherd assemblage under study, suggesting
that they formed the traditional George C. Davis paste type for manufactured ceramic vessels. They hold
the key to identifying local materials, as their distinctive mineral types are described as common in the
geological literature of the surrounding region.
Many of the ceramic vessels (and identified types) clearly were produced from materials near, if not
on, the site. Some few specimens, as inferred from their distinctive clay pastes and minor minerals, were
non-local in manufacture. Implied source beds of clay were largely residual, but alluvial beds for clays
and other minerals cannot be ruled out. Comparative and experimental research with local materials
could decide some of these issues with specificity.
Paste Groups
Identification of paste groups and their varieties followed the microscopic thin section point counting
analysis. The paste groups were identified and defined by application of a hierarchical procedure
(Robinson 2017). The hierarchical procedure identified the tempering agent (or agents) first, followed by
the paste characteristics, the major minerals, and lastly the minor minerals. The procedure identified six
distinctive paste groups (Table 4). Within the paste groups, four variants were identified in paste groups
B, C, and D. Percentages reported in the descriptions below are of the 200 point count. PDI stands for
Particle Diversity Index, the count of every different identified particle in the section.

are identified in this paste group category (Table 5). Grog particles varied in shape, color, and internal
silt patterns. Temper particles of quartz were defined and determined as being larger than silt quartz, at
least medium sand-sized, and any shape, although this was typically sub-rounded and sub-angular, with
smaller fractions of angular and very angular particles. Clay pastes are mixed, containing as many as five
distinctive types of clay masses in various colors.

TKP1025, Punctated sherd. The quartz tempering is comprised of common, composite, and chert forms.
Composite grains attain coarse sand sizes, with the others being smaller. The mixed paste has four
distinctive grog types. Major mineral types are lacking, but minor minerals include alkali feldspar (one
grain), ferric and ferrous hematite, andesite (one grain of fine-grained rock), and 3 percent biotite. PDI 11.
TKP1026, Punctated sherd. Quartz tempering includes common, composite, and vein quartz types. The
mixed clay paste contains four types of grog and additional distinctive clay masses in strips and bands
through the paste. The section contains four small bone particles (2 percent), not enough to be suitable as
a temper. Minor minerals are ferrous hematite (iron oxide) and biotite. PDI 9.
TKP1027, Plain bottle sherd. The tempering is grog and common quartz in a large proportion, with minor
chert and composite quartz. Ferrous hematite is a major mineral (10 percent). Bone and muscovite mica
are found in small sizes and incidental amounts. They are the minor minerals. PDI 8.
TKP1029, Punctated sherd. Common quartz temper is 32 percent of the point count, with 1 percent
composite quartz. Grog is a lesser fraction of the temper. The paste is mixed. Ferric hematite is the only
major mineral. Unknown rock fragments, magnetite, and ilmenite comprise the minor mineral suite in
trace amounts. PDI 8.
TKP1031, Punctated sherd. The temper is grog and common quartz with minor amounts of composite
quartz. The paste is mixed. Ferrous hematite is the major mineral, and minor minerals are lacking. The
PDI is 5, the lowest PDI in the studied collection.
TKP1033, Duren Neck Banded. The temper is five types of grog, common quartz, chert, and composite
quartz. The paste is mixed. Ferrous and Ferric hematite and mica are the major minerals. Mica is 5.5
percent in abundance, which is very high in the sample collection. An unidentified rock fragment and an
incidental occurrence of bone comprise the minor minerals or bodies. PDI 10.
TKP1034, Duren Neck Banded. Grog, common quartz, chert, vein quartz, and composite quartz comprise
the temper. There are three distinct grog types in the mixed paste. Major minerals are ferrous and ferric
hematite and mica (4 percent). Minor minerals are incidental bone (vertebrate) and pyroxene. PDI 11.
TKP1035, Duren Neck Banded. Grog, common quartz, composite quartz, and chert form the tempering
materials. The paste contains a mixture of four distinct grog types. The major minerals are ferrous
hematite and mica, and ferric hematite comprises the minor mineral suite at 1.5 percent. PDI 8.
TKP1038, Duren Neck Banded. The temper is common quartz and chert, and the paste has four
distinctive admixed grog types. Ferrous hematite is the major mineral, and magnetite, mica, invertebrate
egg cases (1 percent) and voids containing woody burnout bits (1.5 percent) comprise the minor mineral
suite. PDI 9.
TKP1040, Duren Neck Banded. The tempering agents are particles of grog, common quartz, composite
quartz, and chert in a mixed paste with four types of clay masses. The major mineral is ferrous hematite,
while the minor minerals are ferric hematite, one piece of silt-sized bone, voids with woody burnout
material, invertebrate egg cases, and traces of biotite and muscovite mica. PDI 12.
TKP1046, Plain Rim sherd. The temper is common quartz, composite quartz, and chert. The mixed
paste contains three clay ball types. Mica and ferrous hematite comprise the major minerals, while ferric
hematite, magnetite, voids with woody burnout material, unidentifiable rock particles, and pyroxene form
the minor mineral suite. PDI 12.

TKP1047, Plain Rim sherd (Figure 3). The temper is grog and a larger amount of common quartz.
The grog particles are of two distinctive types. The dark, unitary main paste of the section has a high
proportion of quartz silt (36 percent) in it. The major mineral is mica. Minor minerals are composite
quartz, chert, incidental bone, and a few forms of mineral iron (magnetite, ferrous hematite, and ferric
hematite). PDI 11.

Figure 3. Paste Group A, TKP1047. Note greenish-colored grog particle with silt pattern denser than the
main paste around it.
UT495, Holly Fine Engraved. Four distinctive types of grog, common quartz, and chert comprise the
temper in a mixed paste. Ferrous hematite and magnetite are the major minerals, and ferric hematite,
unidentifiable rock fragments, mica, two particles of alkali feldspar, an incidental occurrence of bone,
and voids with woody burnout material comprise the minor mineral suite. PDI 12.
UT500, Holly Fine Engraved. Four distinctive types of grog, common quartz, composite quartz, and
chert form the temper in a mixed paste. The major mineral is ferric hematite; and ferrous hematite,
magnetite, mica, an unidentified rock fragment, an incidental occurrence of bone, and a few voids with
woody burnout material comprise the minor minerals. PDI 12.
UT509, Weches Fingernail Impressed. The temper is grog and quartz in the form of common quartz, chert,
and a particle of quartzite. The paste is mixed. Major minerals are ferrous and ferric hematite. The minor
minerals are bioclastic shell, an unidentified rock fragment, an andesitic fine-grained rock fragment, mica,
and voids with woody burnout material. Additionally, the paste contained an unusual type of void, in the
form of elongated hexagons, frequently in coarse sand and smaller sizes, 10 percent by point count. The
hexagon-shaped voids were also observed in sections TKP1037, UT530, and UT531. A few of the other

26

sections’ hexagon-shaped voids contained apparent carbonized material, a possible clue to the distinctive
voids’ nature and presence in the ceramic sherds: they may have been seeds whose material burned out
completely in the ceramic firing. Whether or not the materials forming the distinctive voids were added
deliberately or accidentally to the pastes cannot be determined at this time. PDI 13.
UT 510, Weches Fingernail Impressed. The temper is five types of grog and quartz in the form of
common, composite, and chert quartz, all in a mixed paste. A major mineral is glauconite pellets. Minor
minerals are ferrous and ferric hematite, one particle of bone, another of alkali feldspar, ilmenite, and
voids containing woody burnout material. PDI 12.
UT514, Weches Fingernail Impressed. The temper is three types of grog and quartz in the forms of
common quartz, composite quartz, and chert. The paste is mixed. The major mineral is ferrous hematite;
and the minor mineral suite is comprised of mica, two incidental bone particles, unidentified rock
fragments, pyroxene, and voids with woody burnout material. PDI 11.
UT516, Davis Incised. Temper is three types of grog and common quartz; the mixed paste contains distinctive
masses in color and silt patterns. The major mineral is ferrous hematite, and minor minerals are biotite mica,
an unidentifiable rock fragment, one piece of incidental bone, and voids with woody burnout material. PDI 8.
UT519, Davis Incised. The temper is three types of grog and common quartz and chert; the mixed paste
contains three distinct clay masses. The major mineral is ferric hematite, and the minor minerals are
magnetite, ferrous hematite, plagioclase feldspar, mica, an incidental piece of bone, and an unusually
high (3 percent) proportion of invertebrate egg cases. PDI 11.
UT521, Davis Incised. The temper is four types of grog, common quartz, and chert with traces of
composite quartz and vein quartz. The paste is mixed. The major mineral is ferrous hematite. Minor
minerals are mica, an unidentified rock fragment, voids containing woody burnout material, and
incidental bone. PDI 11.
UT522, Davis Incised. The temper is five distinct types of grog and common and composite quartz. The
paste is mixed. Major minerals are ferric and ferrous hematite, mica, incidental bone, and voids with
woody burnout material. PDI 9.
UT525, Dunkin Incised. The temper is four distinctive types of grog and common and composite quartz
and chert. The paste is mixed. The major minerals are ferric and ferrous hematite. The minor minerals are
incidental occurrences of bone, an unidentifiable rock fragment, invertebrate egg cases, and voids with
woody burnout. Additionally, the section yielded one fine sand-sized grain of calcite, the only identified
carbonate particle in the collection. PDI 12.
UT527, Dunkin Incised. The temper is three types of grog, common quartz, and chert. The paste is
heavily mixed. The major minerals are ferric and ferrous hematite and magnetite. The magnetite may
also have served as additional tempering given its size (up to very coarse sand-sized) and proportion in
the section: 4 percent. The section lacked minor minerals. PDI 7.
Paste Group B and Phase Group B, Var. 1
These eight Paste Group B sherds have a quartz temper with unitary pastes, and low mica (Table 6).
Quartz temper is the same as in Paste Group A. Most unitary pastes are dark, presumably iron and carbonrich, and most have one or two types of clay masses in them. Part of this group’s distinction is the relatively
low proportions of muscovite mica, or its absence altogether. The variant of the group, UT543, stands in
opposition to the others in Paste Group B because it has a very high proportion of mica (6.5 percent) in the
paste point counts.

UT501, Holly Fine Engraved (Figure 4). The temper is common quartz with a small amount of vein
quartz. The unitary paste is black with a few gray-green clay masses. Major minerals are ferric and
ferrous hematite and an unidentified fine-grained rock fragment. Minor minerals are voids with woody
burnout material. The section is very distinctive in having a unitary paste and relatively few aplastic
inclusions. PDI 9.

Figure 4. Paste Group B, UT501. Note black unitary paste with low silt content and oval void with
carbonized remnant material around the edges identified as a “woody burnout.
UT504, Holly Fine Engraved. The section is notable for having a high diversity of types (PDI 13) but
generally low numbers of each type, several with only one identified particle. The temper is common
quartz with a very small fraction of chert. The general angularity of the temper suggests that it does not

28

come from an alluvial source. The unitary paste has a few examples of three different kinds of very small
clay masses to interrupt its unitary nature. The only aplastic that qualifies as a major mineral is ferrous
hematite. Otherwise, the minor minerals include silt-sized incidental bone, ferric hematite, magnetite,
fine-grained rock fragments, pyroxene, biotite mica (one grain), a large glauconitic pellet, and one void
with woody burnout remains. PDI 13.
UT507, Weches Fingernail Impressed. The temper is common quartz, and the unitary paste has a few
clay balls of two different types. Ferric hematite is the only other mineral qualifying as a major mineral
at 5 percent. Rare minor minerals are magnetite, ferrous hematite, mica (1.5 percent), and four voids with
woody burnout material in them. PDI 8.
UT512, Weches Fingernail Impressed. The temper is common quartz with minor fractions of composite
quartz and chert. The unitary paste is apparently lacking in any admixed clay balls, having only its
temper and additional major and minor aplastic inclusions. The major mineral is ferric hematite, and
minor minerals include ferrous hematite and three particles of silt-sized mica. PDI 8.
UT513, Weches Fingernail Impressed. The temper is common quartz with a very minor fraction of
composite quartz. The unitary paste has a few small recognizable clay masses of two types. The major
mineral is ferrous hematite, and minor minerals include incidental bone, unidentified fine-grained rock
fragments, ferric hematite, invertebrate egg cases, and relatively large amounts of voids with woody
burnout material in them. PDI 11.
UT528, Dunkin Incised. The temper is common quartz with minor chert particles. The paste is unitary.
Ferric hematite is the major mineral. Minor minerals are a fine-grained rock fragment, incidental bone,
and three silt-sized particles of mica. The thin section has high proportions of two types of organics.
The first is carbonized invertebrate egg cases in voids (6.5 percent), and the second is a relatively high
proportion (4.5 percent) of voids containing woody burnout material. One woody burnout void is in the
shape of a stick (i.e., a void channel) 2 mm+ long. PDI 10.
UT534, Dunkin Incised. The temper is common quartz with minor chert and composite and vein quartz.
The unitary paste contains a few examples of very small clay masses. The major mineral is ferrous
hematite, and minor minerals consist of one particle of mica, one particle of an unidentified rock
fragment, one particle of incidental bone, some ferric hematite particles, and voids with woody burnout
material (3 percent). PDI 12.
Phase Group B, Variety 1
UT543, Pennington Punctated Incised. The temper is common quartz with one particle of chert. The
unitary paste has a few examples of four different clay masses, but is otherwise light and anisotropic,
or visually mobile. Ferrous hematite and mica are major minerals, mica at 6.5 percent; this is
extraordinarily high for mica in the collection. The micaceous quality of the overall section may explain
the lightness and anisotropic dynamics of the paste. Minor minerals are one unidentified rock fragment, a
few glauconite particles, and voids (2 percent) with woody burnout material in them. PDI 9.
Paste Group C and Phase Group C, Variety 1 and Variety 2
There are 25 sherds in Paste Group C, including one sherd each in Variety 1 and Variety 2 (Table
7). The group is iron-tempered and quartz and grog-tempered. In every case the proportions of forms of
mineral iron are higher than those of quartz. Proportions of grog vary, and tend to be lower in the unitary
pastes and higher in the mixed pastes. The major and minor minerals may be quite diverse. The two
variants both have strongly micaceous pastes.

the anisotropic paste have two identifiable grog types. The section does not have a major mineral, but
the minor minerals are mica, chert, an unidentified orange rock fragment, and voids with woody burnout
material in them. The section also has a large proportion (16 percent) of the hexagonal-shaped voids
observed in a few sections listed earlier. One such void in this section contains unidentified carbonized
material. PDI 9.
TKP1048, Plain Rim sherd (Figure 5). The temper is quartz, grog, and the collective forms of iron:
ferrous and ferric hematite, magnetite, and ilmenite. The somewhat silty paste is mixed with clay
masses and additional iron. The major mineral is mica. Minor minerals are chert and a fine-grained rock
fragment. PDI 10.

UT502, Holly Fine Engraved. The temper is ferric and ferrous hematite with magnetite and a trace
of ilmenite. The dark paste is mixed and contains four recognizable grog types. Common quartz also
tempers the paste. A major mineral is lacking. Minor minerals include chert, mica, and a few small
particles of incidental bone. The section is notable in the assemblage for having fewer aplastics overall
and notably smaller particle sizes. PDI 10.
UT503, Holly Fine Engraved. The temper is ferric hematite. The paste is unitary with only a few
scattered yellow-brown and red-brown clay masses. The paste color is very dark grayish-brown.
Common quartz also tempers the paste. A major mineral is lacking. Minor minerals are silt- and fine
sand-sized mica (2 percent), three grains of silt-sized incidental bone, and one void with woody burnout
materials. The section has lower numbers and smaller particle sizes of the aplastics. PDI 7.

Specialized Ceramic Analyses of the George C. Davis Site (41CE19) Ceramic Assemblage 31
UT505, Weches Fingernail Impressed. The temper is ferric and ferrous hematite with additional minor
amounts of ilmenite. The mixed paste has four distinct grog types in it. The major mineral is common
quartz, and minor minerals are silt-sized mica, fine-grained rock fragments, a small fraction of relatively
large bone particles (2 percent), and one large particle of charcoal. The section has relatively small and
few particles overall. PDI 10.
UT506, Weches Fingernail Impressed. The temper is ferrous hematite with a trace of ferric hematite. The
dark, mixed, paste has four recognizable grog types. The major mineral is common quartz (6 percent),
and minor minerals are chert, one grain of pyroxene, one grain of incidental bone, and a small fraction of
voids with woody burnout material. PDI 9.
UT508, Weches Fingernail Impressed. The temper is ferrous and ferric hematite with additional minor
amounts of ilmenite, but their proportions are matched almost by common quartz and composite quartz.
The combined proportions are 12.5 percent iron forms and 11.5 percent quartz forms. The dark, mixed, clay
paste has three grog types, also used as a temper. There are no major minerals, but the minor minerals are
mica, a fine-grained rock particle, and voids (1.5 percent) with woody burnout material. PDI 10.
UT520, Davis Incised. The section overall has few added or resident particles other than a high amount
of silt quartz. The temper is quartz and a relatively low amount (5.5 percent) of ferric hematite and
magnetite. The section has a unitary paste with only an occasional hematite-rich clay mass. The major
mineral is mica (3.5 percent). Minor minerals are composite quartz and chert. PDI 9.

is lacking, but minor minerals are chert, incidental bone, a glauconite pellet, and mica. The section is notable,
too, in having at least two hexagonal-shaped voids, as described above. Both observed shapes fell into the very
coarse sand-sized category. One of the voids has woody burnout material in it. PDI 13.
UT531, Dunkin Incised. The temper is ferrous hematite with additional common quartz, and the paste is
mixed, showing three distinct grog types for more temper. A major mineral is lacking, but minor minerals
are chert, mica, incidental bone, pyroxene, and voids with woody burnout material in them. The section
also has one hexagonal-shaped void in it. PDI 10.
UT532, Dunkin Incised. The temper is ferrous hematite with additional ferric hematite, and magnetite,
and common quartz. The mixed paste has three identifiable grog types. There is no major mineral, but
minor minerals are chert, mica, and voids (3.5 percent) with woody burnout material in them. PDI 9.
UT533, Dunkin Incised. The temper is ferric and ferrous hematite with additional magnetite in large
particle sizes. Common quartz, however, is in a proportion large enough (8 percent) to have also been
added as a temper, along with four distinct types of grog in the mixed paste. A major mineral is lacking,
but minor minerals include chert, mica, incidental bone, incidental shell, a few voids with invertebrate
egg cases, and significant (2.5 percent) voids containing woody burnout material. PDI 12.

32

Specialized Ceramic Analyses of the George C. Davis Site (41CE19) Ceramic Assemblage

UT535, Crockett Curvilinear Incised. The temper is ferric hematite and magnetite, although common
quartz is in a high enough proportion (7 percent) also to have served as a temper. The unitary paste has a
few grog particles in it. The section lacks a major mineral apart from the tempers, and the minor minerals
are composite quartz, chert, mica, a fine-grained rock fragment, and voids containing woody burnout
material. PDI 10.
UT537, Crockett Curvilinear Incised. The temper is ferrous hematite, magnetite, and ferric hematite,
along with common quartz as a temper. The paste is heavily mixed, with four distinct grog types
contributing significantly to the tempers. Glauconitic clay balls or pellets are the major mineral, and
minor minerals include chert, mica, incidental bone, clusters of invertebrate egg cases, and voids with
woody burnout material in them. PDI 12.
UT542, Pennington Punctated Incised. The temper is ferrous and ferric hematite, common quartz, and a
few particles of grog. The paste is unitary, very dark, without observed additional clay masses except for
a yellow-brown micaceous strip along one edge. There is no major mineral, but minor minerals include

distinct grog types. The paste is mixed, and is distinguished by having high resident silt, 50.5 percent of
the total point count. The major mineral is mica (6 percent), and the minor minerals are an alkali feldspar
particle, a chert particle, and a glauconite pellet. PDI 9.
Paste Group D
Paste Group D has bone, quartz, and grog temper. The group has 10 sections (13.9 percent of the
sherd sample), including two sherds in Variety 1 (Table 8). Pastes in this group may be mixed or unitary,
and paste minerals show some diversity. Variety 1 has high proportions of mineral iron in the paste.

TKP1032, Punctated sherd. The temper is crushed bone in large amounts (37.5 percent) with additional
contributions from common quartz (21 percent) and a few grog particles. The paste is unitary, with no
observed additional clay masses. There are no major minerals as a category, but minor minerals are
ferrous hematite, composite quartz, and chert. PDI 7.
TKP1036, Duren Neck Banded (Figure 6). The temper is bone in medium sand sizes, but common quartz
in the same size class is higher in proportion. It is probable that both served as tempers in this vessel,
along with five distinct grog types. The paste is mixed. Major minerals are mica, ferrous hematite, and
chert. Minor minerals are composite quartz, pyroxene, an unknown high relief mineral, a fine-grained
rock fragment, voids with clustered invertebrate eggs, and voids with woody burnout material in them.
PDI 14.

Figure 6. Paste Group D, TKP1036. Note small bone piece near center, and a large dark grog mass near right.
TKP1039, Duren Neck Banded. The bone temper is in a small proportion (2.5 percent) but with particle
sizes up to coarse sand. The mixed paste has three identifiable grog types. Major minerals are common
quartz and ferric hematite. Minor minerals include ferrous hematite, chert, mica, composite quartz, two
grains of ilmenite, and voids with woody burnout material in them. PDI 11.
UT497, Holly Fine Engraved. The temper is bone with a large proportion of common quartz as an
additional tempering material. The mixed paste has three identifiable grog types. Major minerals are
ferrous hematite and chert. Minor minerals are vein quartz, composite quartz, magnetite, ferric hematite,
and an unidentified rock fragment, possibly andesite. PDI 11.

34

UT515, Davis Incised. Temper is bone and common quartz. The mixed paste has three identifiable grog
types. The major mineral is mica. Minor minerals are composite quartz, chert, ferrous hematite, an
unidentified rock fragment, and voids with woody burnout material in them. PDI 10.
UT518, Davis Incised. Temper is bone in a very large proportion (39.5 percent) and common quartz. The
paste is mixed, with three identifiable grog types. The major mineral is ferrous hematite. Minor minerals
are magnetite, composite quartz, mica, chert, plagioclase feldspar, ferric hematite, a wood charcoal
fragment, and voids with woody burnout material in them. PDI 13.
UT538, Crockett Curvilinear Incised. Temper is bone and common quartz. The mixed paste shows four
distinct clay ball types. Major minerals are ferric and ferrous hematite and mica. Minor minerals are
chert, composite quartz, and voids with woody burnout material in them. PDI 10.
UT539, Crockett Curvilinear Incised. Temper is bone in a very high proportion (57.5 percent). The
unitary paste has only a few hematitic grog particles and low silt content. There are no major minerals,
and minor minerals amount to a particle of magnetite and a few voids with woody burnout material in
them. This section is highly distinctive for its overall low numbers of aplastic inclusions apart from bone
and its low particle diversity. PDI 7.
Phase Group D, Variety 1
UT517, Davis Incised. Temper is bone with common quartz and a high proportion (14.5 percent) of
ferrous hematite in large particle sizes. The mixed paste has three distinctive grog types in it. Minor
minerals are mica, chert, and voids with woody burnout material in them. PDI 8.
UT524, Davis Incised. The temper is bone with only a small proportion of common quartz. Oblong
euhedral magnetite crystals in significant proportion (16 percent) were also added as a tempering agent.
The paste is mixed clays showing four distinct grog types. The major mineral is muscovite mica, and the
minor minerals are common quartz, ferrous hematite, ferric hematite, and voids with woody burnout in
them. PDI 9.
Paste Group E
The group includes five thin sections having magnetite and ferrous hematite temper with some
contribution from common quartz and grog (Table 9). What sets this group apart from the other paste
groups at George C. Davis is the sprinkling of igneous-derived minerals in the minor minerals set. The
combinations of igneous materials in the sections suggest non-local origins of the five sherds. Four of the
sections are identified as the Grooved decorative style, and the fifth section is from a Weches Fingernail
Impressed vessel.

Additional background research was conducted on ceramic petrographic and geologic bases to address
the issue of provenance of the ceramic vessel sherds in this paste group. Iruegas (1999:279-290)
examined petrographically 14 ceramic thin sections from the Hurricane Hill site (41HP106) in the

Specialized Ceramic Analyses of the George C. Davis Site (41CE19) Ceramic Assemblage 35
South Sulphur River drainage in Hopkins County, in Northeast Texas. He found feldspar in 12 of the
sections in amounts ranging from one to 11 percent of the point counts (Iruegas 1999:281 and Table
9-12). The site is located on deposits and nearby alluvium of the Cretaceous Navarro group undivided
(Kna). Examination of geological maps attempted to locate the nearest volcanic outcrops to the George
C. Davis site. The Cretaceous Woodbine Group undivided (Kwb) in Texas and Oklahoma is described as
having volcanic sand and tuff. Tributaries of the Red River drain the formation in the region about Red
River County, Texas. In southeastern Oklahoma, tributaries both of the Red River and Little River drain
outcrops of the formation. And “in Arkansas, tuffaceous material more abundant” (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1979). There, the Little River drains extensive exposures of the Woodbine Group undivided
(Kwb). Southwestern Arkansas can be expected to have much volcanic material in its river-borne
deposits as well as its bedded structures, or outcrops.
TKP1042, Grooved. Temper is ferrous and ferric hematite, with magnetite and common quartz and grog
as additional tempers. The anisotropic mixed paste has four identifiable grog types. The section has
no major minerals, but minor minerals are mica, chert, alkali feldspar (one fine sand-sized grain), an
unidentified rock fragment, and a void with woody burnout material in it. PDI 12.
TKP1043, Grooved (Figure 7). Temper is ferrous and ferric hematite with common quartz. The
anisotropic mixed clay paste has four distinctive grog types as additional temper in it. The major
minerals are composite quartz and chert. The minor minerals are alkali feldspar, mica, magnetite, and an
unidentified rock fragment. PDI 15
TKP1044, Grooved. Temper is magnetite with some hematite, common quartz, and grog. The silty, mixed
paste exhibits two clear grog types. The major mineral is chert, and the minor minerals are alkali feldspar,
olivine, mica, pyroxene, a glauconite pellet, and a void with woody burnout remains in it. PDI 13.
TKP1045, Grooved. Temper is magnetite, ferrous hematite, grog, and possibly common quartz. The
mixed clays have two recognizable grog types in them, and these are the same types as are found in the
UT511, Weches Fingernail Impressed. The temper is grog and common quartz with possibly chert,
composite quartz, and ferrous hematite as additional tempers. The mixed, anisotropic, paste has three
grog types and is notable for being very light in color. The major mineral is mica (7.5 percent). The
minor minerals are alkali feldspar, composite quartz, volcanic tuff, plagioclase feldspar, a trace of
granitic rock, and traces of ilmenite, incidental bone, and magnetite. PDI 15.
Paste Group F
The last paste group identified in the collection resembles sandy paste pottery of other Texas pottery
making traditions. The group is comprised of only one specimen (TKP1041). The specimen has aplastic
inclusions, but none that can serve as tempering agents. The sherd therefore is un-tempered.
TKP1041, Grooved (Figure 8). The sherd lacks any particle class of aplastic inclusion that is large or
plentiful enough to function as a tempering agent in the original formed vessel. The mixed paste has four
distinct clay masses in it. Major minerals are ferrous hematite and common quartz, but their size classes
are too small (coarse silt to fine sand) to serve as temper. The minor minerals are composite quartz, chert,
magnetite, mica, incidental bone, and voids with woody burnout in them. The sherd lacks any particles or
features that may serve as telltale indicators of manufacture outside the George C. Davis region. PDI 10.

Summary and Conclusions
The George C. Davis site petrographic analysis identified six distinctive paste groups that crosscut
the major types at the site, albeit with a sample size of 72 sherds. The paste groups identified are
thought to be representative of the site’s ceramics, however, because of their consistent repetition across
the examined sherd sample. They also match the iron-rich clays highly rated for their ceramic-making
potential found widely in the locality and region. Grog is particularly common throughout the Caddo
area, as it is in this study; quartz tempers are also a regular occurrence (Table 10). Iron minerals, on the
other hand, may be thought of as a distinctive aspect of George C. Davis-centered ceramic production.
They are found in most other regions as well, but their concentration in the collection studied here is
notable (Paste Group C). Clays full of iron compounds may be found in several localities near and on the
George C. Davis site, including gravel bars and alluvial deposits along the Neches river.
Table 10. Summary of paste groups in the George C. Davis petrographic sample.

___________________________________________________________________________
Paste Group A. Grog and quartz temper with mixed pastes, 23 sherds.
Paste Group B and Variety 1. Quartz temper with unitary pastes, 8 sherds.
Paste Group C and Variety 1 and Variety 2. Mineral iron, quartz, and grog temper, unitary or mixed pastes, 25
sherds.
Paste Group D and Variety 1. Bone, quartz, and grog temper, mixed pastes, 10 sherds.
Paste Group E. Mineral iron, quartz, and grog temper with anisotropic pastes and igneous minor mineral suites, 5
sherds.
Paste Group F. Un-tempered, sandy paste, one sherd.

___________________________________________________________________________
Perhaps the most intriguing finding of this study is the internal consistency of the paste of the
Grooved vessel sherds and their likely status as non-local ceramics. Four of the five sample sherds occur
in Paste Group E. Background research on localities of igneous minerals point toward Southwestern
Arkansas in the Red River and Little River drainages primarily, and secondarily in the South Sulphur
River drainage in Northeast Texas. Other undiscovered source localities may well exist.
Minutely focused studies such as this one (Table 11) need a kind of translation in order to gain more
generalized usage in ceramic studies. Both petrography and INAA are slow and expensive, each for
different reasons. In the case of petrography, information gained needs value and application to efforts
involving rapid characterization of thousands of sherds. These needful characterizations are made by
means of the unaided eye, magnifying lenses, and low-power stereoscopic microscopes using plain
light. Field identifications also need to be rapid and accurate. Current research topic areas (Shafer 2007)
require these accurate ceramic assessments. This study assists the effort by offering keys for megascopic
identification of suspected Caddo ceramics in East-central and Central Texas prairie sites, based on the
completed petrographic analysis.

Specialized Ceramic Analyses of the George C. Davis Site (41CE19) Ceramic Assemblage

Specifically, George C. Davis site-centered ceramics that may be found in the Central Texas region have
multiple keys apart from decorative elements on sherd surfaces:
a. Grog temper generally, quartz temper commonly, bone temper occasionally. Grog
temper is identified by having different silt patterns and colors than the main paste and
generally but not always by angular shapes. The quartz temper is angular, sub-angular, or
sub-rounded and distinctly larger than the quartz silt, or free silica, resident in the paste.
Bone temper needs the other keys to set it apart from other locally made Central Texas
bone-tempered wares, whether the wares are from sites contemporaneous with George
C. Davis (ca. A.D. 900-1300), or with Toyah phase sites (ca. A.D. 1300-1700) that may be
both contemporaneous and later in time than George C. Davis (see Kenmotsu and Boyd
2012:10). Considering the thin sherds and light pastes of Leon Plain wares (Creel et al.
2013:32; Suhm and Jelks 1962:95 and Plate 48), this should not be difficult.
b. Generally dark, earth-toned cores and surfaces—dark brown, brick red, black, and
orange-red.
c. coarse-textured paste mixed with different colored and shaped clay masses. The George
C. Davis site ceramic vessel sherd pastes commonly show three to six clay masses in round
and oval shapes, and strips and bands through the paste. These are not to be confused
with exterior and interior surface layers or interior carbon streaks. Colors may range from
yellow-brown, reddish-black, medium brown, gray-green, dark grayish-brown, and scarlet.
Sizes range from coarse sand through very coarse sand and granule (> 2 mm) sizes. Black
particles in various shapes are mineral iron forms, and they also serve as good keys to a
Davis site-manufactured vessel. Some black particles may also be carbon in various forms.
This petrographic study has shown the utility of petrography for answering larger research questions
of ceramics and their distributions. It is hoped that future studies using comparable methods can add to
increasingly informative databases concerning the character of Caddo ceramic wares.

Summary of the Analytical Findings, Steps 1-3
Timothy K. Perttula
This report concerns selected ceramic analyses of the George C. Davis (41CE19) ceramic
assemblage that were done at the request of the Texas Historical Commission to obtain analytical data
to identify Early Caddo ceramics in Central Texas sites possibly occupied by Prairie Caddo peoples
(see Shafer 2007). These analyses were to conduct instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of a
sample of Davis site pottery for a baseline comparison for early Caddo pottery from Central Texas; (2)
conduct petrographic analysis of Davis site pottery to establish a baseline comparison for early Caddo
pottery from Central Texas; and (3) determine vessel size through rim and body sherd diameters from the
Davis site pottery using a graduated chart.
The INAA work included 25 sherds from other recognized wares at the site, beyond the 50 sherds
from decorated wares analyzed by Descantes et al. (2003, 2005), including Free Punctates (TKP 10251026, 1028-1032), Duren Neck Banded (TKP 1033-1040), Grooved (TKP 1041-1045), Bowles Creek
Plain (TKP 1046-1049) (see Newell and Krieger 1949), and a plain bottle sherd (TKP 1027), to insure
that all Early Caddo ceramic wares from the site have been sampled for INAA.
The INAA sherds from the George C. Davis site are included in the Group 9 core (see Figure 2),
which includes primarily sites from the Neches and Angelina river basins in Cherokee, Houston, Rusk,
San Augustine, and Shelby counties. Biplots of chromium (CR) and cesium (CE) were used to separate
the Region 9 core from Region 9, Groups 1 and 2. Ferguson (2010:7) concluded that the ceramics in the
Region 9 core “are made primarily from chemically-similar and widely available alluvial clays,” in the
case of the George C. Davis site vessels, almost certainly the alluvial clays of the Neches River and its
principal tributary, Bowles Creek.
The principal elements in the clay paste of each of the ceramic sherds from the George C. Davis site
are cesium (CE), iron (FE), aluminum (AL), potassium (K), and titanium (TI) (see Tables 1 and 2). The
parts per million values for chromium range from 51.0249-103.046 in the UT INAA sherds and from
58.6833-91.8526 in the present sample of sherds, and the values for cesium range from 1.5405-6.4571 in
the UT sample and 1.4705-4.1393 in the present sample; the samples have virtually the same chemical
parameters. Nevertheless, comparing the chemical values of the sherds from each of the defined ceramic
types in the overall INAA sample it is apparent that there are chemical variations between them—
particularly between the sherds from Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Pennington Punctated-Incised
vessels and the other types—implying that different sources of local clay were used for the plain wares,
utility wares, and fine wares manufactured at the George C. Davis site.
Vessel size data from the determination of rim orifice diameters in the George C. Davis ceramic
assemblage are based on the analysis of 500 rim sherds in the collections of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin, including 200 rims from fine ware (i.e.,
engraved and slipped) vessels from different vessel forms, 200 rims from utility ware (wet paste designs),
and 100 from plain ware vessels. In general, rim sherds from habitation contexts are from larger vessels
(22.74 + 4.36 cm for fine ware carinated bowls and bowls, 23.1 + 4.92 cm for utility ware jars than those
in special feature and/or burial contexts, except for carinated bowls, which are about 18 percent larger in
special feature and/or burial contexts (26.6 + 6.0 cm) than they are general habitation areas.

Specialized Ceramic Analyses of the George C. Davis Site (41CE19) Ceramic Assemblage

The George C. Davis site petrographic analysis identified six distinctive paste groups among the 72
analyzed sherds. With the exception of Paste Group E (n=5 sherds), the paste groups are considered to
be representative of the site’s ceramics. They match the iron-rich clays found widely in the locality and
region. Grog is particularly common throughout the Caddo area, as it is in this study; quartz tempers are
also a regular occurrence. About 87 percent of the analyzed sherds have grog temper, and these occur in
Paste Groups A, C, D, and E. Iron minerals in the paste are a distinctive aspect of the George C. Davis
ceramic wares, as they occur in 35 percent of the analyzed sherds (Paste Group C). They are found in
most other regions as well, but their concentration in the collection studied here is notable. Clays full of
iron compounds may be found in several localities near and on the George C. Davis site, including gravel
bars and alluvial deposits along the Neches river.
Fine ware sherds most commonly have Paste B and C compositions (20-50 percent of the fine
ware sherds in the sample. In the case of the utility wares, they proportionally have more sherds in
Paste Groups D and E, comprising between 90-100 percent of these groups; only 6.7 percent of the fine
ware sherds in the sample fall in these paste groups. Plain ware vessels have only Paste Group A and C
compositions. This evidence suggests that some proportion of the three wares were made with different
selected pastes by Caddo potters, even though grog-quartz and grog-quartz-iron pastes were by far the
most commonly selected pastes; 66.7 percent of the George C. Davis sherds in the analyzed samples
have these pastes.
Specifically, as Robinson outlines in Step 3 of this document, the George C. Davis site can be
characterized as follows, and these attributes can be employed to identify ceramics at other locales
(including Central Texas) that had been manufactured at this site and by Caddo peoples living in the
middle Neches River basin: (1) they have grog temper generally, quartz temper commonly, and bone
temper occasionally. Grog temper has different silt patterns and colors than the main paste and generally
has angular shapes; (2) he quartz temper is angular, sub-angular, or sub-rounded and distinctly larger
than the quartz silt, or free silica, resident in the paste; (3) generally the sherds are from vessels that have
dark, earth-toned cores and surfaces that range from dark brown, brick red, black, and orange-red; (4)
the vessel sherds have a coarse-textured paste mixed with different colored and shaped clay masses. The
George C. Davis site ceramic vessel sherd pastes commonly show three to six clay masses in round and
oval shapes, and strips and bands through the paste; and (5) black particles in various shapes are mineral
iron forms, and they also serve as good keys to a Davis site-manufactured vessel.
The Paste Group E sherds (n=5) have been identified as being of non-local manufacture because of
their mineral iron, quartz, and grog temper in the paste along with igneous minor mineral suites; their
analysis by INAA did not sort these sherds from the others of presumably local manufacture with respect
to the chemical values of the sherds. Volcanic minerals, especially feldspar and tuff, occur in the Paste E
thin sections. Volcanic minerals are not local to the George C. Davis site, and the actual source beds may
lie in the Cretaceous formations of North Texas and Southwest Arkansas (most notably the Great Bend
region), including in the alluvial terraces of the Red River, which drains a very large area with many
igneous sources and features.
Four of the five sherds in Paste Group E have very distinctive grooved decorations. Newell and
Krieger (1949:123 and Figure 48a-d) noted how rare Grooved sherds or grooved-engraved sherds
(Newell and Krieger 1949:Figures 31b, d and 48b, e) were at George C. Davis, comprising only about
1.3 percent of the more than 11,000 typologically and ware-identified sherds in the excavations (Newell
and Krieger 1949:Table 13). Krieger (in Newell and Krieger 1949:12) commented that it “is possible
that these constitute a distinct minor type at the Davis site, for nothing quite like them has come to the
writer’s attention elsewhere.”

As it turns out since Krieger’s day, grooved and grooved-engraved vessels of Early Caddo period
age have been recovered from burial features at the Crenshaw site (3MI6) on the Red River in Southwest
Arkansas, where they have been called Crenshaw Fluted (Durham and Davis 1975:Figures 19:1, 3, 31:6,
and 37:Q13); they are not known at other sites in any other parts of the Caddo area. The Crenshaw site
is a major mound center and cemetery complex of Woodland and ancestral Caddo occupations; the Late
Fourche Maline (ca. A.D. 850-1000 and Early Caddo (ca. A.D. 1000-1200) period components were the
most extensive there (Schambach 1982). The Crenshaw Fluted vessels were made by Caddo potters in
the Early Caddo period component there.
These vessels have vertical grooved/fluted and horizontal grooved/fluted decorative, sometimes
together with engraved decorative elements (Figure 9a-b). The petrographic data discussed by Robinson
from the grooved sherds in the George C. Davis site, and the rare but consistent occurrence of grooved/
fluted vessels at the Crenshaw site in the Great Bend region of Southwest Arkansas, clearly points to their
manufacture by Caddo potters in that region, and a number of vessels (Newell and Krieger [1949:123]
estimate sherds from as many as 50 vessels) were traded/exchanged with the Caddo community at the
George C. Davis site several hundred miles to the southwest in East Texas.
