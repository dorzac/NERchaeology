ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of an
archeological survey conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) for
the Lynn Creek Linear Trail Project (CSJ: 0902-90-025) in the City of Arlington, Tarrant
County, Texas. As the City of Arlington is a political subdivision of the State of Texas,
the proposed project will require coordination with the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) prior to construction, per the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
All work conformed to 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 800 and 13 Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which outline the regulations for implementing Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the ACT, respectively.
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any archeological sites that
could be adversely affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources
for their potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or
eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The
archeological survey was conducted by archeologist Thomas Chapman on 12 December
2017, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8248. During the IES survey, one historicperiod archeological site (41TR308) was recorded within the 5.37-acre Area of Potential
Effects (APE). Based on the lack of association with a significant historical event(s) or
person(s), lack of standing buildings/structures, and the low potential to yield significant
archeological data, the portion of 41TR308 documented within the APE is considered not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, C, or D or designation as a SAL.
No artifacts were collected as part of this survey. All records will be temporarily curated
at the IES McKinney office and permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL). No further work is warranted. However, if any
archeological sites, other than those documented within this report, are encountered
during construction, the operators should stop construction activities and immediately
contact the project environment representative to initiate coordination with the THC prior
to resuming any construction activities.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental
Solutions, LLC (IES), under subcontract to Schrickel, Rollins, and Associates, Inc. and on behalf of the
City of Arlington, for the proposed Lynn Creek Linear Trail (CSJ-0902-90-025). The purpose of these
investigations was to conduct an inventory of cultural resources (as defined by Code of Federal
Regulations, Title 36, Section 800.4 [36 CFR 800.4]) present within the proposed project area and to
evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended, or for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) under the Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT; Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26 [13 TAC 26]) and was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 8248. A brief description of the proposed project area or Area of Potential Effects
(APE), environmental and historical contexts, field and analytical methods, results of the investigations,
and recommendations regarding the identified cultural resources are provided in this document. Prepared
in accordance with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002) guidelines, this report satisfies the
NHPA Section 106 and ACT requirements of the proposed project.

1.1 Introduction
The City of Arlington proposes to construct a 1.64-mile pedestrian and cycling trail along Lynn Creek
between the current endpoint of the Lynn Creek Linear Trail near Buttercup Lane to New York Avenue in
the City of Arlington, Tarrant County, Texas. The APE is plotted on modern aerial photography and the
Arlington 7.5-minute series U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle map (Figures 1.1
and 1.2). The proposed project is located within property owned and maintained by the City of Arlington
and is funded by Texas Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration. As the
project consultant for Schrickel, Rollins, and Associates, Inc. and on behalf of the City of Arlington, IES
performed an archeological survey to locate any prehistoric or historic-period archeological sites that
could be considered potentially eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or designation as a SAL within the
5.37-acre APE.

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
The APE encompasses an approximately 5.37-acre area that ranges in width from 16 feet to 168 feet
along the 1.64-mile proposed trail corridor. Engineering designs call for the construction of a 12-foot
wide concrete pathway with 2-foot shoulders that would include landscaping, concrete benches, and
retaining walls. A prefabricated, 40-foot by 12-foot pedestrian bridge would be installed approximately
450 feet east of the existing Lynn Creek Park Trail end connection. To construct this trail, grading and
drainage improvements would be required throughout the APE, which includes the installation of four
pipe culverts. The westernmost culvert would be located approximately 290 feet west of the cul-de-sec of
Watch Hill Court. One culvert would be located approximately 400 feet east of the intersection of Victory
Crest Drive and Sienna Drive and another 185 feet south of the intersection of Broken Kettle Road and
Sienna Drive. A final reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) culvert would be located 450 feet west of New York
Avenue.
Vertical impacts within the APE would primarily be restricted to the ground surface; however, the
proposed grading would reach approximately 6 to 12 feet in depth. These deeper subsurface impacts
would occur between Hillgreen Drive and South Collins Street and approximately 120 feet directly east of
South Collins Street where the retaining walls and rock rip-rap would be installed; however, these deeper
grading activities would occur within areas that have been significantly disturbed. As such, it is
anticipated that no backhoe trenching would be required.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Climate
Tarrant County is in North-Central Texas. This region features a humid subtropical climate with an
annual rainfall average ranging from approximately 35 to 40 inches. About half of the rain usually falls
between April and May, with July and August being the two driest months of the year. The subtropical
region tends to have a relatively mild year-round temperature with the occasional exceedingly hot and
cold snaps (Estaville and Earl 2008).

2.2 Topographic Setting
The USGS Arlington 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map illustrates that the APE is primarily located
within a gently sloping upland setting along Lynn Creek, a tributary to the Elm Fork Trinity River. The
APE parallels Lynn Creek and is dissected by several of its unnamed tributaries (see Figure 1.2). Lynn
Creek empties into Joe Pool Lake approximately 1.85 miles southeast of the APE.

2.3 Geology and Soils
The APE is located within the Northern Blackland Prairie in the Texas Blackland Prairie ecoregion. This
region is distinguished from surrounding regions by the gently rolling hills and fine-textured, black clayey
soils with predominant prairie vegetation (Griffith et al. 2007). Vertisols dominate the Texas Blackland
Prairie and consist of a high content of clay that has great shrinking and swelling potential. The Eagle
Ford Formation (Kef) underlies these soils, and consists of shale with calcareous concretions, siltstone,
and limestone (McGowen et al. 1987; Scoggins 2004; USGS 2017; Figure 2.1).
As shown by the Soil Survey of Tarrant County, Texas, there are seven mapped soils within the APE
(Ressel 1981; Table 2.1). Approximately 81.4 percent of the APE contains soils typical of upland terrain
within the Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion. The remaining 18.6 percent of the APE contains
frequently flooded soils along Lynn Creek. Soil data was viewed from the USDA NRCS Web Soil Survey
(Web Soil Survey 2017; Figure 2.2).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
A file search within the TASA maintained by the Texas Historic Commission (THC) identified no
previously recorded archeological sites, previously conducted archeological surveys, National Register
Properties, historical markers, or cemeteries are located within or directly adjacent to the APE (TASA
2017). TASA records indicated that one previously recorded archeological site and twelve previously
conducted archeological surveys are located within 1 mile of the APE (Figure 3.1; Tables 3.1 and 3.2).
TASA records do not contain any data for the previously recorded archeological site (41TR126).

3.2 Regional Historical Background
Prior to 1843, occupation by Anglo-American settlers was limited due to hostile relations with Native
American Comanche, Kiowa, and Wichita tribes. A series of punitive raid attempts, beginning in 1838,
were conducted against the Native Americans settled along Village Creek, culminating in the Battle of
Village Creek on May 24, 1841. A treaty signed in 1843 relocated the Native Americans to a reservation
on the upper Brazos River. The treaty provided a greater sense of security to immigrants, which began to
move into the region in larger quantities. By 1849, the growth in population warranted additional military
support. Thus, an outpost, Camp Worth (later to become the town of Fort Worth), was established and the
area was formally recognized by the Texas Legislature as Tarrant County (Hightower 2012). The postCivil War and Reconstruction years during the mid- to late-1860s saw the population decrease, as well as,
economic decline and shortages. However, construction of the Texas and Pacific Railroad and the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad through Fort Worth, during the 1870s, ensured the importance of the
region and aided in its development and growth. Spurred by the railroads, agriculture began to take root

during the 1880s. Agriculture was firmly established within the region by 1890, when open range
ranching and long-distance cattle drives were eliminated by the widespread adoption of barbed wire
fencing. The combination of agriculture coupled with localized cattle ranching continued to fuel growth in
Tarrant County, raising the population from 41,142 to 152,800 between 1890 to 1920. Economies within
Tarrant County flourished until the peak of the Great Depression in 1932. Times remained tough, with
few employment opportunities, until New Deal projects were initiated by President Franklin D Roosevelt.
The economy continued to improve with the onset of World War II, which permanently established Fort
Worth as an aviation powerhouse in both the military and manufacturing sectors. Population growth
within the county was immense during the mid to late 20th century, rising from 361,253 in 1950 to 1.4
million by 2000. The population growth was linked to several key components, including: aviation and
manufacture, interstate highway construction, and the completion of the DFW International Airport.
Today, the City of Fort Worth and Tarrant County has maintained its frontier atmosphere while serving as
a vital component to the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area (Hightower 2012).

3.3 Archeological Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering archeological sites within the APE. These sources included the Soil Survey of
Tarrant County, Texas, the Geologic Atlas of Texas - Sherman Sheet, the USGS topographic map, the
NRCS digital soil database for Tarrant County, the Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM), the
National Archives and Records Administrationâs (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for
Tarrant County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, and both past and current aerial
photography.
Disturbance Analysis
During the background review, it was determined that ground-disturbing activities have transpired within
the APE since the mid-twentieth century that have pertained to land use, transportation development, and
residential development (Figure 3.2). Prior to the 1990s, the area surrounding the proposed project area
largely consisted of agricultural properties and dispersed rural residences. A vegetated riparian corridor
has been maintained along Lynn Creek since at least the early 1950s; however, some erosion is evident
along the channel and its unnamed tributaries on a 1953 USGS aerial photograph. By the late 1960s,
several ponds had been created using earthen berms within the more severe erosional areas as depicted in
a 1968 USGS aerial photograph. This erosion and subsequent earthen berm construction is likely to have
compromised the contextual integrity, specifically integrity of location, design, and association, of
archeological deposits in those areas, if present. The area surrounding the APE remained largely
unchanged until 2000, with the construction of several residential developments adjacent to the APE
including the Lynn Creek Village, the Western Trails Addition, the Eden Creek Addition, and the Collins
Terrace subdivisions (Tarrant Appraisal District 2017). A review of modern aerial imagery indicates that
the portion of the APE along Jessica Lane has been extensively disturbed during the construction of the
roadway. In addition, the portion of the APE south of Sienna Drive near the intersection with Switchgrass
Road is the former location of one of the mid-twentieth century ponds previously described. These areas
are also expected to have severely compromised contextual integrity.
Prehistoric Resource Potential
Data presented within the PALM indicates that most of the APE contains a moderate potential for
containing shallow and deeply buried prehistoric resources within a reasonable context. In areas where the
APE crosses or is located on the lower terraces of Lynn Creek, there is high potential for shallow
resources and a moderate potential for deeply buried cultural resources. The PALM indicates that
negligible potential is present within limited portions of the APE near the intersection of Switchgrass
Road and Sienna Drive (described above) and along New York Avenue (Figure 3.3). While portions of

Lynn Creek Linear Trail Project (CSJ: 0902-90-025)
Archeological Survey Report

IES Project No. 04.022.011
Page 10

the APE have been affected by vegetation removal and urban development, it is recommended that
portions of the APE contain a reasonable context and has retained moderate to high probability for
preserving archeological deposits.
Historic-Period Resource Potential
Historic-period resources within North-Central Texas are primarily related to farmsteads, houses, and
associated outbuildings and structures that date from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries.
Typically, these types of resources are located along old roadways, but can also be located along
railroads, creeks, and open pastures. Although determining the presence of the earliest of these buildings
and structures is problematic, thorough and accurate post-1920 maps depicting these features were widely
available.
The 1920 U.S. Bureau of Soils map for Tarrant County indicated that a historic-period dwelling was
located immediately north of the eastern terminus of the APE at New York Avenue. This is confirmed by
the 1959 USGS topographic map that depicts a structure in the same location. Historical aerial
photography from 1953 shows that the structure, a residential house, had several associated outbuildings
and was situated on a fenced parcel north of the APE. Although many of the outbuildings have been
removed, the house is currently standing at 6618 New York Avenue.
At the eastern terminus of the project area, a farmstead was formerly located within the APE. The
farmstead consisted of a residential building that was built between 1963 and 1968. An associated barn
structure was erected south of the residence in the 1970s. The residential building was demolished by
1990 and the barn was removed between 2009 and 2011. As such, it was determined that the APE
contains a moderate potential for containing historic-period archeological resources within proximity to
those identified through background research.
Historical maps indicated that the remaining portion of the APE was void of historic-period resources
prior to 1930. This was visually confirmed through historical aerial photography from 1953 and modern
aerial imagery review. As such, it was determined that the APE contains a low potential for containing
historic-period archeological resources outside of the area identified above.

METHODOLOGY
The archeological inventory for the archeological survey of the Lynn Creek Linear Trail Project was
conducted on 13 December 2017. The methods and density of excavating shovel tests met the minimum
requirements for fieldwork stipulated by the THC and CTA Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.
Prior to field work, the IES staff conducted a historical and archeological records search to determine
what archeological sites have been recorded within the APE and within a 1-mile radius of the APE. This
information was detailed in Chapter 3. Additionally, IES staff reviewed ecological, geological, soils data,
as well as, historical and recent topographic maps and aerial photography.

4.1 Survey Methods
Approximately 3.72 acres of the total 5.37-acre APE was located within areas that have experienced
significant disturbance. The remaining 1.65 acres appeared to have avoided modern ground disturbances.
As such, the pedestrian survey consisted of location-specific investigations that targeted high probability
areas (HPAs) within the APE (Figure 4.1). To develop HPAs, areas containing with moderate and high
potential for containing cultural resources identified within the PALM were selected within the APE.
This selection was compared to current land use, past disturbances, and previous survey limits. HPAs did
not denote the specific limits of a given survey, but was expanded or contracted depending on field
observations. Areas displaying high levels of disturbance were photographed to document the lack of
potential for intact archeological deposits. Other documentation methods included narrative notes, maps,
and shovel test records.
Shovel Testing
In areas with potential for archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to 80 centimeters (cm) or
the bottom of culturally sterile deposits, whichever was encountered first. Each shovel test was 30 cm in
diameter and was hand excavated in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness.
Excavated soil was screened using Â¼-inch hardware cloth to test for the presences of buried archeological
material. All tests were recorded on maps and plotted using hand-held global positioning system (GPS)
units. Investigators documented the results of each test on standardized shovel test forms. Although the
entire APE was comprised of 5.37 acres, due to the aforementioned reasons, acreage for the HPA was a
much smaller area of approximately 1.27 acres. Although HPA methodology is not discussed within the
CTA survey standards, using the standards as a guideline, a minimum of two shovel tests were conducted
for each HPA acre surveyed. However, shovel test numbers varied from this amount based on the exact
limit of cultural material, the level of disturbance, erosion, and steep slope observed during the pedestrian
survey. All positive shovel tests, cultural features, and other site data were geospatially recorded using
Trimble XT hand-held GPS units.
Site Delineation and Recording
An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural resources.
The recognition of a âsiteâ is therefore contingent on the basis of content and extent. Content may refer
to artifacts or cultural features encountered in surface or subsurface contexts, architectural elements, or
other manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the vertical and horizontal
spatial arrangement of these cultural remains. For surficial materials, a site is defined as five or more
artifacts of at least two different materials or functional classes located within the same vicinity (typically
a 400-m2 [0.1-acre] area) or at least one cultural feature. The extent of the surface artifacts and cultural
features are then defined as the site boundary. When artifacts or features are encountered in buried
contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally positive excavations. In cases where an
excavated survey sampling location (i.e., shovel test or backhoe trench) yields cultural materials,

additional delineation excavations are conducted to define the boundary of the site. The spatial extent of
the site is defined within the extent of positive excavations. Archeological sites may also be defined
within the extent of surface artifacts or features and culturally positive excavations when both are present.
Cultural remains meeting these criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site
Data Form, and submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) to be included in the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) database. Conversely, discovery of cultural materials that do not
meet these criteria are considered isolated occurrences of past human activity and are simply documented
by location and content. Modern materials and features (i.e., less than 50 years old) are not considered
sites, with only location and content documented. Depending on depositional integrity and cultural
content, archeological sites can be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as SALs. Cultural
isolates and modern features are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as SALs
because of their failure to meet site definition and their inability to contribute important information to the
understanding of history or prehistory.
Standards for archeological methods require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For this
reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are described in imperial units (e.g., inches,
feet, miles) within this report, archeological measurements and observations are listed in metric units
(e.g., centimeters, meters, kilometers), unless historic-period artifact or architectural elements are more
appropriately recorded in imperial units.
Archival Research
Historic maps and aerial photographs encompassing the direct APE and indirect APE were reviewed to
determine the locations of historic-age (e.g., greater than 50 years old) structures. Deed/title research was
conducted for historic-period architectural resources and archeological sites that contained evidence of
historic-period site components. The purpose was to identify historically notable persons that were
possibly associated with the site. Initial research was carried out by examining deed and land title records
at the Tarrant County Clerkâs office. The historic significance of identified persons associated with each
resource were also researched using The Handbook of Texas Online database and within various local
history publications.

4.2 Site Evaluation
Each identified archeological site was plotted on the appropriate 7.5-minute USGS topographic map and a
scaled site map was prepared for each site. Field data were processed to evaluate site significance and
potential eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and designation as an SAL. When applicable, a variety of
data were used to assess site significance including temporal period, artifact density, artifact variety,
feature density, feature variety, feature preservation, stratigraphic integrity, and amount of disturbance.
National Register Evaluation Criteria
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria for evaluating properties for inclusion in the National Register are codified under
the authority of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (36 CFR Part 60.4 [aâd]), and
the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set forth guidelines to use in determining site
eligibility. Federal regulations indicate that â[t]he term âeligible for inclusion in the National Registerâ
includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior and all other
properties that meet National Register listing criteriaâ (36 CFR Â§800.2[e]). Based on Advisory Council
guidelines, any cultural resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register is a
historic property.
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, four criteria
for eligibility are applied. The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,

engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess
integrity of location, design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and:
Criterion A:
Criterion B:
Criterion C:

Criterion D:

that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or
that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history
[36 CFR Part 60.4(aâd)].

The principal objective is to determine whether a cultural resource possesses the potential to contribute to
one or more of the above-defined criteria. Adequate information regarding site function, context, and
chronological placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential
for cultural resources investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal
period, and project design, determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural resources
is a particularly important objective during the inventory and evaluation processes. Criterion D is
generally associated with prehistoric, but also historic-era, archeological sites. Criteria A, B, and C
typically reflect association with historic-era resources, rarely with prehistoric sites. The objective of the
current project was to locate and define both the horizontal and vertical extents of any cultural resources,
document and describe those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for
NRHP eligibility.
State Antiquities Landmark Evaluation Criteria
For purposes of implementing the ACT, the THC is the statutorily created body responsible for protecting
and preserving SALs under the Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191. A SAL is an
archeological site, archeological collection, ruin, building, structure, cultural landscape, site, engineering
feature, monument or other object, or district that is eligible to be designated as a landmark or is already
officially designated as a landmark. The State of Texas considers all publicly-owned archeological sites
and historic buildings and structures to have some intrinsic historic value, and the ACT provides some
level of protection for those sites, buildings, or structures regardless of their size, character, or ability to
currently yield data that will contribute important information on the history or prehistory of Texas.
Additionally, these publicly-owned archeological sites and historic buildings and structures are protected
from vandalism, or other actions meant to take, alter, or destroy them, and information directly related to
the specific location of archeological sites is restricted from open records requests. However, not all
cultural resources are equally significant to the history and prehistory of Texas. Some archeological sites
may not possess research value sufficient to warrant long-term preservation or investigations beyond
survey level documentation, and some historic buildings and structures retain minimal integrity due to
damage or deterioration. Therefore, the issue of whether cultural resources are significant and warrant
preservation, and/or further research (such as archeological testing and data recovery level investigations),
is addressed through official landmark designation, permit issuance, and rules associated with
enforcement of the ACT. Sections 191.091 and 191.092 of the Texas Natural Resources Code provide
that archeological sites and historic buildings and structures on lands belonging to state agencies or
political subdivisions of the state of Texas are landmarks or may be eligible to be designated as
landmarks. Also protected under the Texas Natural Resources Code (Section 191.094) are specially
designated landmarks on private property [above information compiled from Texas Administrative Code,
Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26, Subchapter A, Section 26.2].
Under the ACT at the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL. The THC uses one or more of the following criteria when assessing the
appropriateness of official landmark designation, and/or the need for further investigations under the
permit process:

Lynn Creek Linear Trail Project (CSJ: 0902-90-025)
Archeological Survey Report

IES Project No. 04.022.011
Page 18

Criterion 1: the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or history of Texas by
the addition of new and important information;
Criterion 2: the siteâs archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact, thereby supporting
the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
Criterion 3:
the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
Criterion 4: the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation, thereby
contributing to new scientific knowledge;
Criterion 5: there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and official
landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or alternatively, further
investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting when the site cannot
be protected [13 TAC 26.10].

Buildings, structures, cultural landscapes, and non-archeological sites, objects, and districts may be
designated as landmarks provided that the following conditions are met:
Condition 1:

the property fits within at least one of the following criteria:
(a) the property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic group;
(b) the property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
(c) the property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction,
represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic value, or represents a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinctions
(d) the property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas culture or
history;
Condition 2: the property retains integrity at the time of the nomination, as determined by the executive director of the
commission; and
Condition 3: for buildings and structures only, the property must be listed in the National Register of Historic
Places, either individually, or as a contributing property within a historic district as determined by the
Keeper of the National Register or the executive director of the commission [13 TAC 26.19].

4.3 Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other
documentation will be included in the curation package. All field-generated documents will be
temporarily curated at the IES office and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and
photographs will be organized and catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

RESULTS
During the pedestrian survey, one archeological site was encountered within the 5.37-acre APE
inventoried for cultural resources. Shovel test unit locations are illustrated in Figures 5.1. A photograph
location map, general photographs, and archeological site photographs are located in Appendix A.
Archeological site maps are illustrated in Figures 5.2. Topographical archeological site locations are in
Appendix B.

5.1 Archeological Survey
General Survey Observations
During the survey, field investigations verified that the past agricultural land use had caused surface
disturbances within a large percentage of the APE (see Figure 3.2). The APE was located within a varied
environment that ranged from mixed hardwood forest to maintained park settings (Appendix A,
Photograph 1 through 27). The topography within the APE was primarily minimally-sloped. Several
locations along the APE cross Lynn Creek, and as such, the topography increased in slope (see Appendix
A, Photographs 2, 6, 7, and 11). Overall, the APE west of South Collins Street was located within
maintained areas that appeared to be sporadically mowed. The APE east of South Collins Street was
located within mixed wooded terrain with some portions of the proposed trail paralleling Sienna Drive
and Barred Owl Road. The portions of the APE located within mixed woods setting has experienced low
density dumping, which resulted in modern trash being scattered throughout the APE (see Appendix A,
Photographs 2, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, and 24). The eastern portion of the APE between New
York Avenue and Barred Owl Road (see Appendix A, Photographs 25 through 27).
Archeological Survey Results
During the IES survey, a total 20 shovel tests were excavated throughout the APE (Figure 5.1).
Archeological survey of the APE utilized an HPAs survey method to adequately investigate portions of
the APE that have retained a reasonable context for encountering intact archeological deposits. As such,
two shovel tests were excavated within each HPA when applicable. The small size of several HPAs lent
to testing using a single shovel test. In instances of larger HPAs, shovel tests were place approximately 50
m apart. Field survey verified the disturbances surrounding the HPAs.
Shovel testing within the APE revealed a soil containing a medium to coarse very dark gray clay loams
(10YR 3/2) with 10 to 20 percent gravels. These shovel tests did not exceed 50 cmbs in depth due to
extremely compact clay loams and culturally sterile soils. In addition to shovel testing, subsurface
exposures including animal burrows, disturbed patches, and the cut banks of Lynn Creek were examined
when applicable. Ground surface visibility was predominately zero, however, select areas within mixed
woods contained visibility that reached 40 percent. Ground cover ranged from short grasses within
maintained areas to tall grasses and woody shrubs in overgrown areas.

5.2 Documented Cultural Resources
Site 41TR308
During the IES survey, a newly recorded historic-period archeological site (41TR308) was encountered
within the eastern extent of the APE (Figure 5.2). This newly recorded site pertained to a domestic
dwelling that was constructed between 1963 and 1968. Based on aerial photographic interpretation, the
demolition of the structure took place between 2010 and 2011.
The site was initially encountered when a foundation and associated concrete features were observed
during the background review for this project and were documented during pedestrian survey. As a
result, additional shovel tests were excavated within and surrounding the site. During site delineation, a

total of five shovel tests (TC16 through TC20) were excavated to evaluate the archeological deposits
present at the site. Site 41TR308 was delineated based on the horizontal extent of surface features,
through the excavation of negative shovel tests, and within the limits of the APE. However, a complete
delineation of the site boundary was unobtainable due to the APE limits. The site extends approximately
30 m east-to-west by 43 m north-to-south across the upper terrace bordering Lynn Creek. The northern
and southern portions of the site boundary coincide with the limits of the APE. It is likely that the
southern portion of the site boundary extended up to 15 m outside of the APE, where the upland terrace
transitions into the steeply-sided Lynn Creek channel. The northern portion of the site boundary likely
extends approximately 3 m north to the former property line. The eastern portion of the site boundary
extends to the maintained New York Avenue ROW, currently occupied by utilities and a pedestrian
sidewalk (Appendix A, Photograph 28). The western boundary was delineated through the presence of
surface features and negative shovel tests excavated within the APE.
Survey and Testing Observations
Site 41TR308 was identified on a nearly-level terrace bordering Lynn Creek. Clear evidence of ground
disturbance was observed within the site, which included evidence of a demolished historical-period
structure or structures. Apart from the surface features, the site surface largely consisted of loose gravel
and concrete chunks (Appendix A, Photographs 29 and 30). Several modern ceramic tiles were observed
between Feature 1 and Feature 3. Shovel tests were placed surrounding Feature 1 within locations outside
of the eroded concrete that constitutes Features 2 through 4 to determine the vertical extent and the degree
of disturbance of the site. Additional testing was conducted to the west of the features to determine the
horizontal extent of the site.
Shovel testing revealed a layer of fine dark gray (10YR 4/1) loam that contained 50 percent gravel
inclusions. This layer likely represented the natural soil intermixed with gravel and concrete chunks
disturbed during demolition of the structures. This upper layer extended to approximately 30 cmbs.
Beneath this disturbed layer, soils contained a medium to coarse very dark gray (10YR 3/2) clay loam that
featured significantly less gravel inclusions. This lower layer was identical with soils see throughout the
remaining portions of the APE. Through site delineation, no subsurface artifacts or cultural deposits were
observed.
Historic-Period Features
Feature 1 comprises an intact rectangular slab, measuring 9 m by 17 m, that served as the foundation of
the historical-period dwelling (Appendix A, Photographs 31 through 33). The northern portion of
Feature 1 contains a 1-m-by-0.5-m section of linoleum flooring adhered to the concrete slab. The central
portion of the slab contains a 4-inch iron drainage pipe, the top of which was flush with the slab. Small
trees and shrubs line the northern and southern boundaries of the feature. The western border of Feature 1
parallels the APE, and a small portion of the northwest corner of the feature extends beyond the APE.
Overall, Feature 1 exhibits minimal signs of deterioration or erosion.
Feature 2 is the heavily eroded remnants of the concrete driveway that spanned the eastern extent of the
original dwelling and connected the two New York Avenue access points (Appendix A, Photographs 34
through 36). The feature is approximately 2 m wide and 18 m long. It is located approximately 4 m east of
Feature 1. At the time of the survey, Feature 2 was heavily eroded and partially overgrown. Few locations
featured a smooth surface, and the soil surrounding Feature 2 contains elevated quantities of gravel and
concrete chunks.
Feature 3 is the heavily eroded remnants of a concrete pad surrounding the northern and western borders
of Feature 1 (Appendix A, Photographs 37 through 45). Feature 3 likely pertained to a driveway
extension that provided vehicle and parking access to the rear of the original dwelling. Within the APE,
the feature measures approximately 15 m wide and 19 m long and is present on aerial photography until
1995. Feature 3 extends south of the APE for approximately 11 m and west of the APE for approximately

10 m. At the time of field survey, Feature 3 was in varying states of deterioration with the least
deteriorated portion being within the southern portion of the feature (Appendix A, Photograph 45).
Feature 3 extended beyond the boundaries of the site and APE.
Feature 4 is a 5 m by 6 m eroded concrete slab bordering Feature 3 (Appendix A, Photograph 46).
Feature 4 was differentiated from Feature 3 due to the mound-like form of the concrete. While Feature 3
was relatively level throughout and surrounding the site, the central portion of Feature 4 was
approximately 2 feet higher than the surrounding terrain. Oblong concrete signatures matching the
boundary to Feature 4 are present in aerial photography as early as 2001. As such, it is not likely that
Feature 4 is a result of demolition of the domestic structure between 2010 and 2011. At the time of field
survey, the surface of Feature 4 was heavily pitted but was more intact than surrounding portions of
Feature 3.
Archival Research
Site 41TR308 was documented during this survey near the eastern terminus of the APE. The site is
identified as the structural remnants of a rural residence or farmstead. During the late twentieth century,
the site consisted of a residential building that was built between 1963 and 1968, based on a review of
historic aerial photographs. An associated barn structure was erected south of the residence in the 1970s.
The residential building was demolished by 1990 and the barn was removed between 2009 and 2011.
Using public deed records from the Tarrant County Clerkâs Office, a chain of title for the property
encompassing site 41TR308 was generated (Table 5.1).

The primary domestic structure associated with site 41TR308 was likely constructed while the property
was under the ownership of Maudie Lee Brown and David I. Brown. The associated barn was likely
added to the property by Eddie M. Robinson and Betty Lou Robinson prior to dividing the interest in the
property between trustees Ardell M. Young and James H. Knapp. The structures were then demolished
while the property was under the ownership of James Christopher Knapp, prior to the transfer of the
property to the City of Arlington.

Site Integrity
Site 41TR308 was identified as a late-twentieth-century domestic site encompassing a 0.23-acre area that
measured approximately 30 m east-to-west by 43 m north-to-south. The site delineation and evaluation
process revealed that the site occupied an upper terrace bordering Lynn Creek. No surficial or subsurface
artifacts were observed. Shovel tests illustrated that the upper 30 cmbs of the site had been disturbed and
was intermixed with large quantities of gravel. As such, the contextual integrity of the site is very low.
Summary
Site 41TR308 is a newly-recorded historic-period archeological site that contained concrete features
pertaining to a domestic dwelling constructed around 1968. Demolition of the structures at the site
occurred between 2010 and 2011 and the property was vacant at the time of field survey. A total of five
shovel tests were excavated within and surrounding the site. All shovel tests were negative for cultural
materials. A total of four features were observed within the site, all of which were concrete features that
served the original structure. No subsurface features were encountered during site delineation. It is likely
that the site extends outside of the APE to the west and south. The site has no association with significant
persons of local, regional, or national historical importance.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During the pedestrian survey, 20 shovel tests were excavated within the 5.37-acre APE. As a result of this
survey, one archeological site (41TR308) was documented within the APE.
Table 6.1: Summary of NRHP/SAL Eligibility Recommendations
NRHP/SAL Eligibility
Recommendations

Site Trinomial

Not Eligible

41TR308

41TR308 is a newly recorded historic-period archeological site that contained the foundation slab and
concrete features associated with a mid-twentieth century domestic dwelling constructed between
1963 and 1968. Shovel testing within the site did not encounter any surficial or subsurface cultural
materials. Four surface features were encountered within the site and were generic in design. Based
on the siteâs lack of association with a significant historical event(s) or person(s), lack of standing
buildings/structures, and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the portion of
41TR308 documented within the APE should be considered not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criteria A, B, C, or D or designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended for this site
within the APE. The eligibility of any associated cultural resources located outside the APE remains
unknown.
Therefore, it is the recommendation of IES that the Lynn Creek Linear Trail Project (CSJ: 0902-90-025)
be permitted to continue without the need for further cultural resource investigations. However, if any
cultural resources, other than those detailed within this report, are encountered during construction, the
operators should immediately cease construction activities in those areas. The project cultural resources
consultant should then be contacted to initiate further consultation with the THC/SHPO prior to resuming
construction activities. In addition, if project designs change, and areas outside the APE detailed within
this report are to be impacted, additional field investigations may be required.
