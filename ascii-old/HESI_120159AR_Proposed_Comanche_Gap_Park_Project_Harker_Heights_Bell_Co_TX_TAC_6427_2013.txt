MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 17 and 18 January 2013, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), conducted
an intensive cultural resources survey of the City of Harker Heights’ proposed Comanche Gap
Park Project located in southwestern Bell County, Texas (Project Area). Overall, the Project
Area totals approximately 19.0 acres. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the undertaking
consists of the entire 19.0-acre Project Area. The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by
the City of Harker Heights, a political subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project falls
under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). As the proposed project is a
publicly sponsored undertaking, the City of Harker Heights is required to provide for a cultural
resource inventory of the Project Area to assess the project’s possible impacts on any cultural
resources within the Project Area. At the request of Luck Design Team, LLC, Horizon
conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of City of Harker Heights
in compliance within the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if the development
of the Project Area would have the potential to adversely affect any significant cultural resources
designated as or considered eligible for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks
(SAL).
The survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1 new archeological site
(41BL1366). Site 41BL1366 consists of an extensive multiple-component site, including a midto late-20th century amusement park, homestead, and a scatter of non-diagnostic aboriginal
lithic artifacts situated on a ridge to the southeast of an unnamed tributary feeder to the
Lampasas River. The site encompasses all but the extreme northwest corner of the Project
Area. The aboriginal component of the site may extend to the east and south beyond the
Project Area’s eastern and southern boundaries. As such, the boundaries for the aboriginal
component of site 41BL1366 were not fully documented. As the entire extent of the aboriginal
component of site 41BL1366 was not assessed, its overall eligibility for formal designation as an
SAL remains undetermined. However, the aboriginal deposits within the proposed Project Area
consist only of a moderate- to high-density scatter of non-diagnostic lithic specimens on the
modern ground surface. Based upon the lack of temporally diagnostic stone tools, preserved
floral/faunal remains, or stratified, buried cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the
aboriginal component of site 41BL1366 within the current Project Area is considered to be a
noncontributing element to the site’s overall eligibility for formal designation as an SAL. As
such, no additional investigations are recommended for the aboriginal component of site
41BL1366 in connection with the proposed undertaking.

Management Summary

The historic-era component of site 41BL1366 consists of 16 historic-era structures, of
which 13 structures are still standing. Archival research indicated that site 41BL1366
represents the location of the 1960s Comanche Gap Historical Park, which included a museum
(Structure B), a jail (Structure J), a zoo (Structures N to P), and a concession stand (Structure
H). However, the structures associated with the amusement park on site 41BL1366 retain little
architectural integrity, which diminishes from the integrity of setting, feeling, and association of
how the amusement park once functioned as a whole. The standing house structure (Structure
C) observed on site 41BL1366 does not embody a unique method of construction for a 1960s
home. The remaining standing structures (Structures D, E, G, K, and L) observed on site
41BL1366 are small outbuildings, and the exact function of each structure is unknown.
However, these 5 outbuildings do not possess a unique method of construction and lack
integrity. In addition to the site’s lack of architectural integrity, the historic-era component of site
41BL1366 also lacks intact archeological deposits. Because of this, it is Horizon’s opinion that
the historic-era component of site 41BL1366 is considered ineligible for formal designation as
an SAL. As such, no additional investigations are recommended for the historic-era component
of site 41BL1366 in connection with the proposed undertaking.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the development of the Project Area will have no adverse effect on any
significant cultural resources considered eligible for formal designation as SALs. The aboriginal
component of site 41BL1366 that falls within the current Project Area is recommended as a
noncontributing element to the site’s overall eligibility for designation as an SAL, while the
historic-era component of the site is recommended as ineligible for designation as an SAL. No
additional investigations are recommended on site 41BL1366 in connection with the proposed
undertaking. Horizon therefore recommends that the City of Harker Heights be allowed to
proceed with the proposed Comanche Gap Park Project relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of
the discovery should cease immediately, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be
notified of the discovery.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed Comanche Gap Park Project,
Harker Heights, Bell County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), was contracted by Luck Design Team,
LLC, on behalf of the City of Harker Heights, to conduct an intensive cultural resources survey
for the proposed 19.0-acre Comanche Gap Park Project in Harker Heights, Bell County, Texas
(Project Area; Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The proposed project will entail developing the Project
Area into a historical park complete with a museum, hiking trails, and picnic areas The
proposed development is located immediately southeast of the intersection of Comanche Gap
Road and Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 2410. The Project Area is owned and operated by the
City of Harker Heights.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the City of Harker Heights, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). As the proposed project is a publicly sponsored undertaking,
the City of Harker Heights is required to provide for a cultural resource inventory of the Project
Area to assess the project’s possible impacts on any significant cultural resources in the Project
Area. At the request of Luck Design Team, LLC, Horizon conducted the cultural resources
survey of the Project Area on behalf of City of Harker Heights in compliance within the ACT.
The purpose of the survey was to determine if the development of the Project Area would have
the potential to adversely affect any significant cultural resources designated as or considered
eligible for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL). The cultural resources
survey was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6427.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.
.Jennifer L. Cochran (Principal Investigator) and Briana Smith (Horizon staff archeologist)
conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 17 and 18 January 2013. This
entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts. The Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per
2 acres for projects 11 to 100 acres in size. As such, a total of 10 shovel tests were necessary

within the 19.0-acre Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the
minimum survey standards by excavating 23 shovel tests within the boundaries of the Project
Area.
The survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1 new archeological site
(41BL1366). Site 41BL1366 consists of an extensive multiple-component site, including a midto late-20th century amusement park, homestead, and a scatter of non-diagnostic aboriginal
lithic artifacts situated on a ridge to the southeast of an unnamed tributary feeder to the
Lampasas River. The site encompasses all but the extreme northwest corner of the Project
Area. The aboriginal component of the site may extend to the east and south beyond the
Project Area’s eastern and southern boundaries. As such, the boundaries for the aboriginal
component of site 41BL1366 were not fully documented. As the entire extent of the aboriginal
component of site 41BL1366 was not assessed, its overall eligibility for formal designation as an
SAL remains undetermined. However, the aboriginal deposits within the proposed Project Area
consist only of a moderate- to high-density scatter of non-diagnostic lithic specimens on the
modern ground surface. Based upon the lack of temporally diagnostic stone tools, preserved
floral/faunal remains, or stratified, buried cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the
aboriginal component of site 41BL1366 within the current Project Area is considered to be a
noncontributing element to the site’s overall eligibility for formal designation as an SAL. As
such, no additional investigations are recommended for the aboriginal component of site
41BL1366 in connection with the proposed undertaking.
The historic-era component of site 41BL1366 consists of 16 historic-era structures, of
which 13 structures are still standing. Archival research indicated that site 41BL1366
represents the location of the 1960s Comanche Gap Historical Park, which included a museum
(Structure B), a jail (Structure J), a zoo (Structures N to P), and a concession stand (Structure
H). However, the structures associated with the amusement park on site 41BL1366 retain little

41BL1366 are small outbuildings, and the exact function of each structure is unknown.
However, these 5 outbuildings do not possess a unique method of construction and lack

41BL1366 also lacks intact archeological deposits. Because of this, it is Horizon’s opinion that
the historic-era component of site 41BL1366 is considered ineligible for formal designation as
an SAL. As such, no additional investigations are recommended for the historic-era component
of site 41BL1366 in connection with the proposed undertaking.

However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of
the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area consists of an approximately 19.0-acre tract in Bell County, Texas.
The tract is situated near Harker Heights and approximately 12.0 km (7.5 mi) east of Killeen,
Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) Killeen, Texas, 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1-1). Vegetation on the northern one-third of the Project
Area consists of mainly short grasses and scattered groves of Ashe juniper and oaks, while the
southern two-thirds of the Project Area are covered with dense Ashe juniper and broadleaf oak
woodlands. Photographs of the Project Area are provided in Figures 2-1 through 2-4.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in west-central Bell County, Texas. Bell County is situated
near the southern end of the Lampasas Cut Plain (Hill 1901; Hill and Vaughn 1900; Johnson
1931:125) in Central Texas and close to the common junction of 3 significant physiographic
provinces—the Lampasas Cut Plain, the Edwards Plateau, and the Blackland Prairie. The
Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone situated between the Edwards Plateau to the
west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east, is a low, rolling land that extends in a narrow band
along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern
Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low topographic relief
and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and streams flow at very gentle
gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are associated with a great fault
system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between uplands composed primarily
of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this
boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more
gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of
topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life.
The Lampasas Cut Plain is a roughly triangular area of rolling hill country in central and
north-central Texas situated between the Brazos and Colorado rivers ranging in elevation from
230.0 to 400.0 m (754.0 to 1,312.0 ft) above mean sea level (amsl). The Lampasas Cut
Plain forms a limestone upland that has been dissected by the Brazos River and its tributaries,

resulting in landforms characterized by generally rounded uplands cut by moderately broad,
shallow valleys. Soil is thin to absent on the bedrock and supports a mixed savanna flora,
whereas soil is moderately deep in valley floors, where it supports mixed riparian woodlands
and forests. Karst features include sinks, caves, and rockshelters, but such are neither
common nor extensive. Edwards chert is locally abundant but not widespread across the
Lampasas Cut Plain and is of high quality in some places.
Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Brazos River basin. The proposed
Project Area is situated at the base of an upland formation located approximately 35.0 meters
(m) (114.8 feet [ft]) northeast of an unnamed tributary feeder of the Lampasas River. Elevations
across the Project Area range from between 219.0 and 253.0 m (720.0 and 830.0 ft) above
mean sea level (amsl). The Project Area drains primarily via overland sheet flow toward an
unnamed tributary feeder of the Lampasas River. The unnamed tributary feeder flows
southeast into a portion of the Lampasas River that has been dammed, creating a reservoir
named Stillhouse Hollow Lake. The Lampasas River flows southeast and converges with the
Little River approximately 15.0 mi to the southeast of the Project Area. The Little River, in turn,
flows eastward and empties into the Brazos River. The Brazos River flows southeastward
across the Blackland Prairie and Gulf Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of
Mexico a short distance northeast of East Matagorda Bay.

2.3

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologically, the Project Area is situated on the Lower Cretaceous-age Glen Rose
Formation (Kgr), Paluxy Formation (Kpa), and Walnut Clay (Kwa) (Barnes 1974). The Glen
Rose Formation, Paluxy Formation, and Walnut Clay consist of clay, limestone, mudstone, and
sandstone deposits. Geomorphologically, the Project Area is situated on the Speck-TarrantPurves soil association (NRCS 2013). This soil association is composed of very shallow to
shallow, gently sloping and undulating to rolling, loamy and clayey soils and gravelly sediments
on uplands in the Blackland Prairie and Edwards Plateau physiographic regions. The parent
material of in situ soils in the vicinity of the Project Area is the indurated limestone bedrock that
underlies the region. Closer to the major rivers, soils formed over alluvium of recent and
Pleistocene age, but no substantial alluvial deposits are present in the vicinity of the Project
Area. A mosaic of 4 defined soil types are mapped within the Project Area. These soils are
described below in Table 2-1 (NRCS 2013) and their distribution is mapped in Figure 2-5.
While aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered in deep alluvial
sediments adjacent to major streams in Central Texas, the relative antiquity of the preHolocene-age uplands in the Project Area suggests that any cultural resources would be
constrained to the modern ground surface, rather than in buried contexts, in erosional settings
lacking integrity. Intact, buried archeological deposits may occur within alluvial sediments near
major streams, though no Holocene-age alluvial sediments are mapped within the current
Project Area. The terrain within the Project Area consists of Lower Cretaceous-age limestone
upland formations. Erosion has been relatively extensive within the Project Area, and little
Holocene-age sediment remains on the surface of the upland structure. No alluvial sediments
with the potential to contain buried, intact archeological deposits are mapped within the Project

Project Area would be expected to occur on the modern ground surface in deflated, eroded
contexts that would lack stratigraphic integrity. Historic-era resources may be found in virtually
any physiographic environment. The proximity of the proposed Project Area to the historic city
of Killeen would tend to suggest that the Project Area possesses moderate to high potential to
contain historic-era resources, and the presence of standing structures within the Project Area
suggests an increased potential for architectural resources.

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to 5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.

Bell County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate is
typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature manifest regional
clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and mean
annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and Bomar
1983:18, 50). Climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical subhumid in Bell
County. Average annual precipitation totals 81 centimeters (cm) (32 in) and temperature
averages 19°C (67°F) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the warmest month) to
15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier periods lasting
from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30 to 64 cm (12 to 25 in), were
followed by abnormally wet years with 114 to 127 cm (45 to 50 in) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall
(Baker 1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91 cm (36 in) of rain that fell within an
18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 56-cm (22-inch [in])
deluge that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935 (Baker 1975). Lower
rainfall amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so
frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from
west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture
is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely
penetrate into the region and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950),
an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the
grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the
limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary, characterized as
―approximate,‖ between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes through Bell
County in the vicinity of the project area.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird.

Reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat
snake, eastern hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake,
copperhead, western diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog,
diamondback water snake, Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and
antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are
no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project Area is located within the Central Texas archeological region. The
indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of North
America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through
time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (9,200 TO 6,000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (9,200 to 6,000 B.C.) (Black 1989). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the
PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point
styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian Period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late

HJN 120159 AR

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (6,000 B.C. TO A.D. 800)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic stage
(6,000 B.C. to A.D. 800). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation
of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less pronounced in
Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the
big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base
composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this hunting and
gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more diversified
tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general decrease in
the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows greater
diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
In Central Texas, the Early Archaic subperiod extends from 6,000 to 3,000 B.C., the Middle
Archaic subperiod extends from 3,000 to 1,000 B.C., and the Late Archaic subperiod covers the
1,000 B.C. to A.D. 800 timeframe. Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as
markers differentiating these three subperiods, though other changes in material culture
occurred as well. Perhaps most markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle
Archaic subperiod, continuing into the Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear
during the Late Archaic subperiod. In addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites
through time is often considered to constitute evidence of population growth, though differential
preservation probably at least partially accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 800 TO 1600)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800 to 1600) (Black 1989) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north who
lacked the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1600 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de

16

Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as increased
participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that
heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian
population was greatly diminished.
The earliest known historical occupants of Bell County were the Tonkawa Indians.1
During the 18th century, they made the transition to a horse culture and began using firearm
technoligy. Lipan Apaches, Wacos, Anadarkos, Kiowas, and Comanches also frequented the
land that becomes Bell County. The Lipans camped by the rivers and streams, and early white
settlers had friendly relations with them. Early settlers also recorded that the Indians set fire to
the prairies each spring to burn off the matted winter grass and facilitate new growth. By the
late 1840s, the Lipans, Tonkawas and other groups, who had customarily camped and hunted
in the Bell County area, had been decimated by European diseases and driven away by white
settlement. Comanche raiding parties continued to strike into the county until 1870.
While the Spanish had explored the Little River to the east and had established missions
along the San Gabriel to the southeast in the 18th century, there is no evidence that they
traversed the future Bell County area. Anglo settlement began in the 1830s when the area was
part of Robertson's colony and, somewhat later, part of old Milam County. The area was first
settled in 1834 and 1835 by the families of Goldsby Childers, Robert Davidson, John Fulcher,
Moses Griffin, John Needham, Michael Reed, William Taylor, and Orville T. Tyler. The
settlements were deserted during the Runaway Scrape, reoccupied, and then deserted again
after the Indian attack on Fort Parker in June 1836. In their retreat from the fort, several of the
settlers were overtaken by Indians and killed. The area was reoccupied in the winter of 1836–
37. In November 1836, George B. Erath established a fort on the Little River about 1.6 km
(1.0 mi) below the Three Forks, which has been variously known as Smith's Fort, the Block
House, Fort Griffin, and Little River Fort. The settlements along the river were considerably
troubled by marauding Indians. The more important engagements of 1837 were the Elm Creek
Raid on January 7 and the Post Oak Massacre in June. Little River Fort was abandoned, and by
1838, all settlers had left the Bell County area. On May 26, 1839, the Bird's Creek Indian Fight,
a bloody but indecisive skirmish between Texas Rangers and Comanches, took place about 2.4
km (1.5 mi) northwest of present city of Temple.
Settlers began to return to the Bell County area after the peace treaties of 1843–44, and
Indian raids into the county became less frequent. By the census of 1850, the population of
what would shortly become Bell County was approximately 600 whites and 60 black slaves.
Bell County, named for Peter H. Bell, was formed on January 22, 1850. The election held to

organize the county took place in April at the "Charter Oak," at the military crossing on the Leon
River near the center of the county. Nolan Springs was chosen as the county seat and named
Nolanville. On December 16, 1851, the name was changed to Belton. In 1854, Coryell County
was marked off from Bell County, and in 1856, the legislature attached a 6-mile-wide strip of
Falls County to Bell County. In 1860, when a resurvey of the line between Bell and Milam
counties was made and recognized by the legislature, Bell County assumed its present
boundaries.
The last serious Indian raid in Bell County occurred in March 1859. The Independent
Blues, a company of volunteer rangers led by John Henry Brown, was organized in the
immediate aftermath of the raid to protect the frontier. This group functioned for about 2
months. It was succeeded by several other volunteer units that operated into the summer of
1860. Bell County had a population of 3,794 whites and 1,005 blacks in 1860. Most of the
settlers had come to the county either from the older settled counties of lower and eastern
Texas, or from the southern United States. The county was not really part of the plantation
economy like the eastern part of antebellum Texas; two-thirds of the 179 slaveholders in 1860
owned 7 or fewer slaves, and only 4 county residents owned 20 slaves or more. Belton, Aiken,
and Salado, the only towns, were on a stage route running north from Austin. Salado College
was established in 1859 and flourished in the second half of the 19th century. Early settlement
in the county was along the creeks and rivers, but by 1860, most of the county land, some
462,884 acres, was divided into farms. A series of drought years in the mid-1850s hindered the
development of farming in the area, and Bell County farmers still operated in a frontier economy
on the eve of the Civil War. Due to the uncertain supply of water, much of the land in the county
was considered worthless for anything but undeveloped pasture, and county residents raised
large herds of cattle and sheep. The 42,037 cattle enumerated by the 1860 census was not
equaled again until the 1950s. There were only 21,196 cleared acres in the county in 1860, and
the large number of oxen in the county, 2,132, when compared to the relatively small number of
mules, 646, indicates that many farmers were still doing the heavy work of breaking the land to
the plough. Corn and wheat were the main crops, though cotton was introduced into the county
along the Little River in the mid-1850s and 514 bales of cotton were harvested in 1860.
A significant minority of Bell County residents were Unionists during the secession crisis.
A Whig newspaper, the Independent, was published in Belton, and, in the election of 1859, Bell
County strongly supported Sam Houston. In 1861, however, the county voted 495 to 198 in
favor of secession, and many of the former Unionists loyally supported the Confederacy during
the Civil War. Out of a white population of some 4,000 at the beginning of the war, one source
claims that more than 1,000 Bell County men served in Confederate or state military units.
Companies organized in the county served in the First, Fourth, Sixth, and Eighteenth Texas
Cavalry regiments, and the Sixth, Sixteenth, and Seventeenth Texas Infantry regiments. Bell
County civilians established a variety of rural industries to provide shoes, saddles, and other
goods for themselves and the forces. Unionist sentiment never entirely disappeared, however,
and from 1862 to 1865, some Union sympathizers and Confederate deserters congregated in
northern Bell County at what locals called "Camp Safety."

Reconstruction in Bell County was a troubled and violent period. Federal troops were
quartered in Belton in 1865–66 to support Hiram Christian, newly appointed chief justice of the
commissioners' court, but they were powerless to prevent a series of feuds between political
factions that resulted in murders and lynchings. Horse and cattle thieves thrived in the unsettled
conditions of the time and contributed to the anarchy that prevailed in the county. During the
brief return to self-government under Governor James W. Throckmorton in 1866–67, Bell
County sent X. B. Saunders to the Constitutional Convention of 1866, and a Belton mob helped
to discredit Throckmorton's administration by lynching several pro-Union men who were being
held prisoner for feud-related murders. Bell County whites chafed under the imposition of
congressional Reconstruction in 1868, and a Ku Klux Klan–like organization was established in
the county. Due to the small number of black voters in the county, Radical Republicans were
dependent on military assistance for local control, and the election of December 1869 returned
Bell County to Democratic party rule. The pattern of lawlessness continued into the mid-1870s;
and the worst example of vigilante violence occurred on the evening of May 25, 1874, when a
mob of men from Bell and other counties broke into the Belton jail and killed 9 men, 8 members
of a gang of accused horse thieves and an accused murderer. One of the most interesting
cultural movements of the period in Texas was the Belton Woman's Commonwealth, a celibate
commune of "sanctificationists" that flourished in Belton from the 1870s through the 1890s.
Before the Civil War, African Americans had formed some 21 percent of the county
population. The difficulties they faced in finding a niche in Bell County society in the postwar
period can be glimpsed in an 1868 description of the county's blacks by a former Confederate
officer: ―The negroes behave as well as anyone expected, though a large majority of them...are
inclined to shift from place to place without having any settled employment." Most of the
immigration to the county after the Civil War was white; the black population fell to 11 percent of
the total in 1870 and fluctuated between 8 and 12 percent until the 1970s, when it increased to
about 16 percent. As in other areas of Texas, blacks were relegated to segregated and inferior
housing and educational facilities until the 1960s. Though racial violence was not as common in
Bell County as it was in some areas of the state, there were at least 2 lynchings, in 1911 and
1915, and the Klan was revived in the county in the 1920s.
The Civil War and Reconstruction had a dramatic, if temporary, impact on the county
economy. In 1870, the value of Bell County farms was only half of what it had been in 1860.
Recovery was fairly rapid, aided by the growth of the cattle and sheep industries and, in the
1870s, by a dramatic expansion of cotton farming. From 1866 to the mid-1870s, stock raising
was the chief county industry. One of the main feeder routes to the Chisholm Trail entered the
county near Prairie Dell, extended through the center of Salado and the eastern edge of Belton,
and left the county in the direction of Waco. Many cattle drives passed through or originated in
the county from the 1860s to the early 1880s. Cattle raising, after declining somewhat in
importance in the early-20th century, was again a major part of the county agricultural economy
by 1950, and in 1969 ranchers owned a record 56,101 cattle. Sheep and goat raising also
followed a similar pattern in the county. The number of sheep grew from 9,718 in 1870 to
21,224 in 1880, and nearly doubled again to 42,063 sheep producing 198,665 pounds of wool in
1890. The sheep industry declined dramatically in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to
some 7,859 sheep producing 31,245 pounds of wool in 1920, but revived in the 1930s and

HJN 120159 AR

19

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

reached a new high of 50,141 sheep and 270,311 pounds of wool in 1940. Mohair became a
significant agricultural product by 1930, and reached a peak in 1959, when some 32,269 goats
were raised in the county.
Cotton, the second boom industry in Bell County, also developed after the Civil War.
Cotton culture in the county, which had been relatively insignificant before the war, rose to
successive heights of 9,217 bales in 1880, 37,473 bales in 1890 and a peak of 58,050 bales in
1910. The number of improved acres increased more than sevenfold between 1870 and 1880,
and nearly doubled again to some 378,355 acres by 1890. While much of the land was used to
grow wheat, corn, oats, and other food crops in 1880, cotton was grown on 26 percent of the
cropland in 1890, 45 percent in 1900, 55 percent in 1910, and 61 percent as late as 1930.
Attracted by economic opportunities in ranching and farming, large numbers of
immigrants swelled the population of Bell County in the late-19th century. The number of
residents doubled between 1860 and 1870, from 4,799 to 9,771, more than doubled again to
20,517 in 1880, and had reached 45,535 by the turn of the century. Many immigrants came
either from the older counties of Texas or from other southern states, particularly Arkansas,
Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Population pressure and the shift to cotton production
after 1870 adversely affected the economic position of the growing number of county farmers.
Increasingly concerned over marketing and credit issues, Bell County citizens pioneered the
Grange movement in Texas in the 1870s, and Salado became one of the state centers of
Grange activities. Nevertheless, as early as 1880, 41 percent of the county's farms were
worked by tenants. The number increased to 58 percent by 1900 and remained at about 60
percent until the 1920s, when it increased still further to a maximum of 68 percent by 1930.
Tenancy rates began to decline during the Great Depression with the shift away from cotton and
other staple crops, and by 1959 had dropped to approximately 24 percent of the county's
farmers.
Both the cotton and cattle booms were aided by the improved communications available
in the county in the later 19th century. The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe, the first railroad to be
built in Bell County, reached Belton in 1881 and established Temple as its headquarters that
same year. Temple quickly surpassed Belton to become the largest town in the county by 1890.
In 1882, the Missouri, Kansas and Texas crossed the county, and Belton secured a branch line
of this railroad from Echo. The Belton and Temple Interurban, an electric line, was constructed
in 1905. Roads were generally poor throughout the county in the early 20th-century. There
were 11,748 automobiles in the county by 1935, and extensive improvements, including
blacktopping, of all major roads took place in the 1930s, as highway development continued
throughout the state.
In 1870, only 84 foreign-born inhabitants out of a population of 9,771 lived in Bell
County. Significant numbers of Germans, Austrians, and Czechs moved to the county between
1880 and 1920. Though foreign-born residents never exceeded 5 percent of the county
population, these groups and their descendents formed distinctive cultural enclaves, particularly
in the southern and eastern parts of the county. For the most part, these groups seem to have
coexisted peacefully with the Anglo majority of Bell County citizens, but they were harassed by
the County Council of Defense during World War I and by the county Klan in the 1920s. The
20

Hispanic population never exceeded 3 percent of the county total until the second half of the
20th century, when it rose to some 11 percent of the whole.
By 1930, Bell County had an ethnically mixed population of 50,030. The county
economy was still overwhelmingly agricultural, with only 41 manufacturing establishments
employing some 565 workers in operation that year. While cotton production was near its peak
in terms of percentage of cropland, the cotton industry was already undergoing a rapid
transformation. The combined effects of soil depletion, overproduction, and the boll weevil had
already damaged the industry by the mid-1920s, and the situation of cotton growers was further
worsened by the depression. The county population dropped to 44,863 in 1940, as many
residents left to find jobs elsewhere. Among the county farmers who remained, the depression
encouraged diversification and a shift away from staple crops to livestock. Between 1930 and
1940, the number of acres used for cotton growing fell by more than half, and cotton production
shrank from 57,574 bales to 30,435. Acres used for corn production increased over the same
period by almost half, and wool and mohair production almost doubled, to 137,434 pounds and
75,827 pounds respectively. Though cotton continued to be an important crop in eastern Bell
County, the county's farmers increasingly turned to such other crops as sorghum and wheat and
to livestock raising in the later 20th century. Poultry production also grew in significance in the
county economy, and in 1970, Bell County ranked first in the state in turkey raising.
The 2 world wars had a major impact on Bell County. The community enthusiastically
threw itself into the war effort in 1917, providing twice its draft quota on one occasion and
forming a variety of citizens' organizations to assist in rationing, in maintaining morale, and in
providing services for the armed forces. A more permanent change in county life brought about
by World War II was the establishment of the military base at Fort Hood in the western part of
the county; this large installation continues to function as a military training center. In the 1980s
much of Bell County lay within the boundaries of the military reservation, and the fort's
estimated 160,000 military personnel, dependents, military retirees, and civilian employees
exerted a tremendous economic and social influence on the civilian communities bordering the
base. Neighboring Killeen was the largest city in the county, and the contiguous communities of
Killeen, Harker Heights, and Nolanville, with an estimated combined population of 50,949 in
1980, were home to almost a third of the county's inhabitants.
The growth of the Fort Hood-Killeen area was matched by developments in the rest of
the county. Bell County's population shot up to 73,824 in 1950, and increased by 27 to 32
percent every decade thereafter, to reach 157,820 in 1980 and 191,088 in 1990. The county
also became increasingly urbanized: by 1980, 81 percent of the population lived in urban areas,
and Bell County was one of the most densely populated counties in the state. Population
growth benefited from and contributed to economic diversity in Bell County. In 1982,
approximately 6,900 county residents were employed in factories, more than three times as
many as in 1963; other major areas of employment in the 1980s were construction,
agribusiness, retail trade, and services. Among the noteworthy educational and medical
institutions in the county were the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor, Central Texas College,
Temple Junior College, the University of Central Texas, Scott and White Memorial Hospital, and
the Olin E. Teague Veterans Center.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Politically, Bell County remained solidly Democratic for a century after Reconstruction,
though there were sizable minorities of Greenbackers in 1880, Populists in 1892, and
supporters of James Ferguson, a Temple man, in 1920. Independent farm movements attracted
supporters in the county in 1880s and 1890s, and county prohibitionists achieved their goal of a
dry county in a local-option vote in 1915. The county went Republican by a narrow margin in
the 1928 presidential election rather than vote for the Catholic Al Smith, and went Republican
again in the presidential election of 1972. County voters chose Jimmie Carter in 1976 and then
supported Republican presidential candidates through the election of 2004.
In 2000, the census counted 237,974 people living in Bell County. About 58 percent
were Anglo, 21 percent were African American, and 17 percent were Hispanic. About 75
percent of residents age 25 and older had four years of high school, and almost 20 percent had
college degrees. In the early-21st century the presence of Fort Hood remained a central
element of the area's economy, but local firms also manufactured a wide variety of products,
including computers, plastic goods, furniture, and clothing. In 2002, the county had 2,080 farms
and ranches covering 450,923 acres, 52 percent of which were devoted to crops and 42 percent
to pasture. In that year Bell County farmers and ranchers earned $40,832,000, with livestock
sales accounting for $23,378,000 of that total. Beef, corn, sorghum, wheat, and cotton were the
chief agricultural products. Belton (2000 population, 14,623) is the seat of government and
Killeen (86,911) is the county's largest city. Other towns include Temple (54,514), Harker
Heights (17,308), Salado (3,475), Morgan's Point Resort City (2,989), Nolanville (2,150), Troy
(1,378), Little River Academy (1,645), Rogers (1,117), Holland (1,102), and Heidenheimer
(144). Fort Hood had a population of 33,711 in 2000. Recreation and tourist attractions in Bell
County include Belton and Stillhouse Hollow lakes, the Central Area Museum in Salado, the
Belton Independence Day celebration and rodeo (July), the Central Texas State Fair in Belton
(September), and the Salado Art Fair (August) and gathering of the Scottish clans (November).

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC’s) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of 2 previously
recorded archeological sites within an approximately 1.6-km (1.0-mi) review radius of the
Project Area (THC 2013), while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic
properties listed on the NRHP within the review radius (NPS 2013). These documented cultural
resources and their distances from the Project Area are summarized in Table 4-1 below. No
documented cultural resources, including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or
immediately adjacent to the Project Area.
Based on the Atlas maps, the vast majority of the Project Area has not been formally
assessed for cultural resources. However, a prior linear cultural resources survey extends
along the northern boundary of the Project Area. This prior survey, conducted in 2005 for a
water line funded by the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), produced negative results
in the immediate vicinity of the Project Area.

Chapter 4.0. Archival Research

In addition to the 2 previously recorded archeological sites within the review radius, a
historical marker is located near the northwestern corner of the Project Area. The text on this
marker reads:
Comanche Gap - Break in mountain chain from Lampasas River to Nolan Creek. Route
to one of oldest Indian trails in Southwest, and escape point for Comanches after last raid
in Bell County. On March 14-16, 1859, the Indians killed four settlers, including John and
Jane Riggs. They captured Rhoda and Margaret, daughters of the Riggses, but
abandoned them here at the gap as they fled from a posse. Public feeling after this raid
led to a campaign against the Comanches, led by Maj. Earl Van Dorn, commanding U.S.
Cavalry. Recorded Texas Historical Landmark, 1967

The THC’s Atlas website noted that the historical marker was reported missing in August 2008.
The City of Harker Heights indicated they plan to have the marker replaced somewhere on the
property upon the completion of development within the Project Area (Johnson 2012c).
In addition to information discovered on the THC’s Atlas website, a general Internet
search of Comanche Gap produced several interesting results. As indicated by the historical
marker text, 2 young girls named Rhoda and Margaret Riggs were kidnapped after their parents
were killed by a Comanche raiding party. Two additional accounts of the kidnapping have been
documented in Historic Killeen: An Illustrated History (Skidmore 2010) and A Fate Worse than
Death (Michno and Michno 2007). Both narratives provide detailed accounts of the girls’
kidnapping and eventual escape near the location of Comanche Gap. According to the
accounts, a group of 15 to 40 Comanche Indians invaded settlements near Sugar Loaf
Mountain (now the present-day Fort Hood Military Reservation) in March 1859. In the attack,
they killed a man named Mr. Pierce and chased John Riggs to his home. Riggs hid with his
family, Jane (wife), baby William Jr. (son), and Margaret and Rhoda (daughters) in their home
for a short while before they attempted to flee from the Indians. They quickly captured,
murdered, and scalped Riggs and his wife. They left the Riggs’ baby and kidnapped the 2 girls.
The Indian raiding party returned to the Riggs home and plundered the contents before heading
south on horseback towards Comanche Gap with the 2 girls.
Along the way, the Indians raided several additional locations, stealing approximately
52 horses and killing another man by the name of O’Neil. As the Indians continued south, they
came upon a group of ―cow hunters.‖ Filled with surprise and excitement, the Indians started
running their horses at a very fast pace. In all the excitement, the Indians attempted to pass off
Margaret Riggs from one horse to another, but she fell off the horse and was injured. Rhoda
saw her sister fall and was able to free herself by grabbing a tree and pulling herself off the
horse. The Indians kept going and never returned. The girls were eventually found by relatives
and reunited with their brother. All 3 of the children overcame the trauma, grew into adulthood,
and had productive lives (Michno and Mincho 2007; Skidmore 2010).
In Tandem Lives: The Frontier Texas Diaries of Henrietta Baker Embree and
Tennessee Keys Embree, 1856-1884, Wink (2008) highlights Henrietta Embree’s account of the
Riggs Massacre. The excerpt below is taken from Wink’s website entitled ―The Embree Diaries:
The Companion website for Tandem Lives‖ (Wink 2013). The website highlights the accounts

24

120159_arch_survey_report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed Comanche Gap Park Project,
Harker Heights, Bell County, Texas

of the story according to Embree, as well as the retelling of the story in The History of Bell
County (Atkinson 1929; Tyler 1936) using statements provided to the Belton Daily News by 2 of
the Riggs children.
Henrietta Embree writes of the The Riggs Massacre, a ―Comanche Raid‖ on settlers near
Noland Creek in western Bell County, in the spring of 1859. While her fear is palpable in
her writing and she explains her connection to the Riggs family, who may have been
serving as caretakers of Embree land–though this is not substantiated in accounts of the
event.
Mr. John Riggs and his unnamed wife, their children Rhoda, Margaret, William and John
as well as their neighbor, a Mr. Pierce, were attacked by a Comanche raiding party.
Pierce, Riggs and his wife were killed, the daughters stolen, and the two boys left behind
to be found later by a neighbor. The daughters managed to escape and were also later
found.
The story is retold in both The History of Bell County written by Bertha Atkinson (1929)
and The History of Bell County by George Tyler (1936) using the William C. Riggs’
statement published by the Belton Daily News, February 17, 1886. Margaret Benton
reported, in the same paper March 2, 1887, that she had, in the events surrounding the
aftermath of the attack, …identified a white man named Page as one of the perpetrators
of the alleged ―Comanche‖ attack. He was ―immediately caught, confessed to being one
of the cuthroat mob, gave the names of two other whites who also took part in the
murdering of [her] parents. This villain, whose name was Page, was hung by the people.
The others were also executed, but their names were never known to us.‖ (Tyler 1936).

The last account is interesting as it provides a conflicting account as to who was responsible for
the ―Comanche Raids‖ that kidnapped the Riggs’ girls. In the aftermath of the attack, several
white men were identified as the perpetrators of the Comanche attacks. It is not clear if the
actual attack was conducted solely by white men, and if it was, why original accounts identified
the Comanche as responsible for the attacks.
Several articles posted online in the Killeen Daily Herald (Johnson 2012a, 2012b, 2012c)
discuss the City of Harker Heights’ purchase of the proposed Project Area from the previous
landowner, Bill Alford, and the City’s plans to develop the Project Area into a historical park.
Alford originally purchased the current Project Area in 1963 with the vision to develop the
property into a family-oriented tourist destination in Central Texas. In the mid- to late-1960s,
Alford developed Comanche Cap into one of the largest privately owned zoos in the Southwest,
a museum of artifacts and antiques, Indian dances, a trading post, an outdoor stage with Wild
West shows and melodramas, and a family park. Alford also purchased a 19th-century iron jail
and had it moved onto the property from an unknown location. This structure became one of
the most popular tourist attractions at Comanche Gap. Comanche Gap officially closed to the
public in 1971 (Harper-Talasek 2011). Alford’s son, Steve Alford, provides an interesting
account of his memories of Comanche Gap:
One of my earliest memories of Comanche Gap was helping Dad cut and clear brush for
a picnic area. Financed on the modest salaries of two teachers, Comanche Gap grew to
include one of the largest privately owned zoos in the Southwest, a museum, trading

HJN 120159 AR

Chapter 4.0. Archival Research

post, outdoor stage and family park. Me and my brothers, Tom and David, did daily
chores like feeding the animals, cleaning the cages, and dusting the museum cases. We
also participated in the Comanche Gap Melodrama Troupe, the Indian Dance Team, the
Riding and Gunfight Club and the weekly outdoors Variety Show. Each June we hosted
Frontier Days, a county fair type event complete with carnival rides, concerts, and an old
fiddler's contest.
Needless to say being raised next to a zoo provided quite a few memorable experiences.
There was the time we spent all night trying to capture three black bears that had
escaped. One night I fell off the roof of our old jail while feeding our lion and lay
unconscious for over an hour. After a hard rain the alligator always ended up in our
fishpond. Periodically Dad would go down into our snake pit to collect the pennies and
nickels that had been dropped while I used a garden hoe to keep the rattlesnakes away
from him. Dull moments were hard to come by.
In retrospect the Tuesday Night Variety Shows, which were broadcast on a local radio
station, were a foretaste of the Alford brothers working together. While Tom collected
fifty cents per person at the front gate, I sang in the show, and David sold sodas and
popcorn at the concession stand. We were learning how to stage events as well as the
importance of customer service in a way few kids experience. Today, Tom still handles
most business matters, I'm more involved in our creative projects, and David oversees
warehouse operations. Things haven't changed that much.
Comanche Gap was not a profitable enterprise, but it was never intended to be. In its
heyday it cost you two bits to visit the zoo and museum and a second quarter bought you
a snow cone. Thanks to our parents and Comanche Gap, we learned more about
working together, servicing customers, and living your dream than any classroom
experience could ever provide. The importance of friends and giving back to the
community were practiced not preached. Dad often brought teenagers from broken
homes to the Gap for the weekend, soldiers from nearby Fort Hood adopted us as
surrogate families, and many local town folk would regularly visit, perhaps searching for
some part of America they hoped to preserve (Alford 2013).

Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above an unnamed tributary of the Lampasas River, in conjunction with the
historical marker text that details Native American activity at this location, it is Horizon’s opinion
that there exists a high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the
boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, several structures are visible within the boundaries of
the Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map and on Google Earth. If any of
these structures were built prior to 1963, they may qualify as historic-era structures.
Furthermore, their presence also suggests a moderate to high potential for associated historicera cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
within the Project Area on 17 and 18 January 2013. This entailed intensive surface inspection
and subsurface shovel testing efforts within the Project Area. The TSMASS require a minimum
of 1 shovel test per 2 acres for projects 11 to 100 acres in size. As such, a total of 10 shovel
tests were necessary within the 19.0-acre Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS.
Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating 23 shovel tests within the
Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 6.0-millimeter (mm) (0.25-inch (in)
hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
In general, shovel tests measured approximately 30.0 cm (12.0 in) in diameter and were
excavated to a target depth of 1.0 m (3.3 ft) below ground surface, to the top of pre-Holocene
deposits, or to the maximum depth practicable. In practice, shovel tests were terminated at
depths of 45.0 to 65.0 cm (17.7 to 25.6 in) below surface due to the presence of pre-Holocene
sediments generally composed of dark grayish-brown to yellowish-brown silty clay loam,
gravelly clay loam, and bedrock in surface and near-surface contexts. The locations of all
shovel tests were recorded via handheld global positioning system (GPS) units utilizing the
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American Datum of
1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 5-1, and shovel test data are
presented in Appendix A.
The TSMASS also require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas with
the potential to contain buried archeological materials at depths below those that shovel tests
are capable of reaching (approximately 1.0 m [3.3 ft] below surface). The Project Area is
located near the base of Cretaceous-age uplands adjacent to an unnamed tributary feeder to
the Lampasas River. Shovel testing revealed very shallow surface sediments overlying dense
gravelly clay and bedrock, indicating that shovel testing was capable of penetrating to the
bottom of sediments containing archeological deposits. As such, shovel testing is considered to
constitute an adequate and effective survey technique for identifying archeological resources
within the Project Area, and mechanical trenching was consequently not employed as a siteprospecting technique.

Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations of any
artifacts encountered. A standard site form and hand-drawn sketch map was completed for the
archeological site discovered during the survey and filed at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) to obtain a permanent site trinomial.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility or
for return to the appropriate landowner. Non-diagnostic artifacts were tabulated and assessed
in the field and placed back where they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were
completed as appropriate.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1 new
multiple-component site consisting of a scatter of non-diagnostic aboriginal lithic artifacts, a
historic-era amusement park, and a homestead (41BL1366). A detailed description of the site is
presented below.

6.1

SITE 41BL1366
General Description

Site 41BL1366 represents the remains of a multiple-component site consisting of a
scatter of non-diagnostic aboriginal lithic artifacts, a historic-era amusement park, and a
homestead located 60.0 m (196.8 ft) to the southeast of the intersection of Comanche Gap
Road and Farm-to-Market (FM) 2410 near Harker Heights in Bell County, Texas. The site,
situated at the base of a prominent upland formation, is located approximately 40.0 m (131.2 ft)
northeast of an unnamed tributary feeder to the Lampasas River at an elevation of 219.5 to
250.0 m (720.0 to 820.0 ft) amsl (Figures 6-1 to 6-3). The vegetation surrounding the site
consists of short grasses and dense Ashe juniper and oak woodlands (Figures 6-4 and 6-5).
Overall, the surface visibility across the site ranged from 75% to 90%, with the most exposure
present in the northern portion of the Project Area.
A total of 23 shovel tests were excavated on site 41BL1366. Of these, only 5 produced
evidence of shallow cultural deposits (see Figure 6-2). The remaining 18 shovel tests all
produced negative results, with the bulk of the cultural materials comprising site 41BL1366
observed in surface contexts. The site encompasses all but the extreme northwestern corner of
the Project Area. The historic-era component of site 41BL1366 was fully documented, but the
aboriginal component of the site may extend to the east and south beyond the Project Area’s
eastern and southern boundaries. As such, the entirety of the aboriginal component of site
41BL1366 was not assessed.
Observed Cultural Materials
Observed cultural materials on site 41BL1366 consist of aboriginal lithic specimens and
historic-era artifacts. Aboriginal lithic artifacts include approximately 200 core fragments;
100 primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes; 1 biface fragment; and 1 scraper (Figures
6-6 to 6-8). All of the lithic materials observed on site 41BL1366 were manufactured from light

grayish-brown and dark grayish-brown medium- to fine-grained chert. No temporally diagnostic
formal tools or preserved floral/faunal remains were observed during shovel testing efforts on
site 41BL1366.
Historic-era artifacts observed on site 41BL1366 include approximately 20 amethyst,
10 blue, and 30 clear glass shards; 20 plain whiteware ceramic sherds; and a partial stoneware
crock (Figures 6-9 and 6-10). Several pieces of farm equipment, including the remnants of
3 wooden wagons and 5 metal plows, were also observed on site 41BL1366 (Figures 6-11 and
6-12). These pieces of equipment, likely dating to the late 18th to early 19th centuries, predate
the Comanche Gap Historical Park. This suggests that this equipment may have been
purchased and moved onto the property and as part of a tourist attraction. The partial
stoneware crock (likely a butter churn) observed on site 41BL1366 had a Love Field Potteries
maker’s mark located on the exterior surface of the vessel (see Figure 6-10). This maker’s
mark identifies the vessel as being manufactured between 1923 and 1948 in Dallas, Texas
(Fyock 2007). The amethyst glass shards were observed intermixed with modern trash in a
debris pile near the northern end of the site. Usually, amethyst glass shards suggest a possible
pre-1915 utilization of a site (Lindsey 2013). However, the ambiguous nature of the trash pile
makes it difficult to determine if the amethyst glass shards observed are associated with any
structures at the site. However, the northernmost structure observed on site 41BL1366 (see
Structure A in the Cultural Features Section) appears to be the earliest structure observed on

the site, predating the Comanche Gap Historical Park. This structure appears on the 1947 US
Geological Survey (USGS) Killeen, Texas, 7.5’ topographic quadrangle map; hoverer, it may
date earlier than that. It is possible that the amethyst glass shards may be associated with this
structure. Aside from the amethyst glass shards, the majority the cultural materials observed on
site 41BL1366 suggest utilization of the site from mid- to late 20th century.
Additional artifacts observed on site 41BL1366 include 2 aboriginal artifact collections
and 1 historic-era postcard located within 2 structures on the site (see Structures C and S in the
Cultural Features Section). Artifacts observed within these collections include both diagnostic
and non-diagnostic formal lithic tools (Figure 6-13 to 6-16). Several of the dart points observed
in the private collection have prominent shoulders, with barbs and expanding, straight-edged
stems as well as straight, slightly beveled, or convex bases. These partial points resemble
Lange, Marshal, or Marcos points (Turner and Hester 1999), which date to the Archaic period.
It is not clear whether these lithic tools were recovered from the current Project Area or from an
off-site location. As stated earlier, no diagnostic lithic tools, like the artifacts presented in
Figures in 6-14 and 6-16, were observed on site 41BL1366.
A black–and-white postcard with a 1964 postmark stamp was observed within debris
from the modern house located near the southern boundary of site 41BL1366 (Figures 6-17 and
6-18). The front side of the postcard depicts Bill Alford (park owner) and Comanche Dan
standing on the steps of the Comanche Gap historical museum.
Observed Cultural Features
No aboriginal cultural features were observed on the modern ground surface or in any of
the 23 shovel tests excavated on site 41BL1366. Historic-era cultural features observed on site
41BL1366 include 16 historic-era structures and the remnants of a zoo. Modern cultural
features observed on site 41BL1366 include 3 modern structures, 3 modern fire pits, 1 painted
canvas teepee, and 1 wooden bridge. All historic-era and modern cultural features were
restricted to the modern ground surface on site 41BL1366. All structures observed on site
41BL1366 were given a letter designation A to S (see Figure 6-3). Each feature is discussed
separately below.
The northernmost structure on site 41BL1366, Structure A, has a rectangular footprint
measuring approximately 5.0 by 5.0 m (16.4 by 16.4 ft) (see Figure 6-3). This structure is
supported on Concrete Masonry Units (CMUs) and constructed of clapboard siding and a wood
frame roof. The wooden roof has completely collapsed and the structure retains little
architectural integrity (Figure 6-19). The construction date and function of Structure A is
unknown.
Structure B is located immediately south of Structure A (see Figure 6-3). Structure B
has an almost square footprint measuring 7.0 by 7.0 m (23.0 by 23.0 ft). This structure,
originally constructed of horizontal wood siding and wooden shingles, has completely collapsed
(Figure 6-20). The exact construction date and function of Structure B are unknown; however,
this structure may have functioned as the Comanche Gap historical museum. This inference is
based upon an image from a postcard observed in the recent structure located at the southern

end of site 41BL1366 (see Figure 6-17). In the postcard, the museum has a row of horizontal
wood planks across the lower portion of the structure’s front façade. The same horizontal
planks are seen near the base of the southern façade of Structure B. If this structure represents
the museum, it was likely built in the early to mid-1960s.
Structure C is located immediately to the south of Structure B (see Figure 6-3). This
structure has a rectangular footprint measuring approximately 6.1 by 9.1 m (20.0 by 30.0 ft).
Structure C is constructed of red, horizontal wood siding with a corrugated metal roof (Figures
6-21 and 6-22). The structure has at least five 1-over-1 double hung sash windows on the
north, south, and east façades of the structure. The exact window count is unknown due to
portions of the façades that are obscured by plywood. Structure C has two doors, one each on
the south and east façades. The front door appears to be on the southern façade of the
structure as it opens to a brick and concrete stair block located near the base of the door. The
interior of the structure still contains the dwelling’s furnishings; however, the structure is
unoccupied (Figure 6-23). As noted in the cultural materials section, an aboriginal artifact
collection, consisting of dart points and biface fragments, was observed inside Structure C (see
Figures 6-14 to 6-16). The collection is presumed to have been acquired by the previous
occupant, Bill Alford. Structure C was probably constructed in the early 1960s and appears to
have functioned as a private residence.
Structure D is located approximately 5.0 m (16.4 ft) to the east of Structure C (see
Figure 6-3). This structure, constructed of a wood frame and corrugated metal, has a
rectangular footprint that measures 3.6 by 3.0 m (12.0 by 10.0 ft) (Figure 6-24). A single door
opening and window are located on the southern façade of the structure (Figure 6-25). The
structure appears to function as a pump house; however, the construction date of the structure
is unknown.
Structure E, covered in dense vegetation, is located immediately north of Structure F
(see Figure 6-3). Structure E is has a square footprint that measures 1.5 by 1.5 m (5.0 by
5.0 ft). The structure is constructed from vertical wood siding with a slanted metal roof (Figure
6-26). Due to the dense vegetation surrounding the structure, the structure’s interior could not
be assessed. Based upon the location and the surrounding structures, it appears that Structure
E may have been constructed in the early to mid-1960s. The function of this structure is
unknown.
Structure F is a completely collapsed structure located immediately south of Structure E
(see Figure 6-3). The structure appears to have had a rectangular footprint that measured
approximately 6.1 by 9.1 m (20.0 by 30.0 ft) (Figure 6-27). Due to the lack of architectural
integrity, construction date, the form and function of Structure F are unknown. It is assumed
that this structure was constructed around the same time as the surrounding structures.
Structure G is located along the western boundary of 41BL1366 (see Figure 6-3). This
structure is represented by a square concrete foundation, measuring 2.5 by 2.5 m (8.2 by 8.2 ft),
a wood frame roof, and cedar posts at each corner of the foundation. A machine possibly used
for grinding corn or grain was observed on a slab in the middle of the concrete foundation).

Figure 6-29. Close-up of foundation of Structure G observed 41BL1366
(Figure 6-28). No evidence of the façades to Structure G remain; however, a date carved into
the edge of the foundation suggests the structure was constructed in 1968 (Figure 6-29).
Structure H is located along the western boundary of site 41BL1366 (see Figure 6-3).
This structure has a square footprint that measures approximately 2.0 by 2.0 m (6.6 by 6.6 ft) in
size. Structure H is constructed of a wood frame, vertical wood siding, and a corrugated metal
shed roof (Figure 6-30). The structure was originally yellow with ―SNO CONES‖ painted on the
southern façade of the structure. A single, central window is located on the western façade of
the structure, while a single wooden door is located on the eastern façade. Structure H appears
to have been constructed in the 1960s and likely functioned as a concession stand for the
amusement park.
Structure I represents a double latrine (toilets) likely built and utilized during the
operation of the Comanche Gap Historical Park in the 1960s (Figures 6-31 and 6-32). Structure
I is located approximately 35.0 m (114.8 ft) to the southwest of Structure H (see Figure 6-3).
This structure has a square footprint that measures approximately 2.0 by 2.0 m (6.6 by 6.6 ft) in
size. Structure I is constructed of painted, concrete cinderblocks with 2 wooden doors on the
southern façade of the structure. Behind each door lies a toilet seat sitting upon a wood frame
box. The structure has wood beams across the roof, though no solid roof structure is present.
Structure J represents the interior of a 19th-century jail (see Figure 6-3). This structure
has a rectangular footprint that measure approximately 6.1 by 4.6 m (20.0 by 15.0 ft). With
the exception of a wood frame and corrugated metal shed roof and small wooden porch, the

structure is constructed completely from metal (Figures 6-33 to 6-36). The structure itself
retains some architectural integrity; however, it is missing its exterior façades. Structure J
comprises of 6 holding cells, 3 each on the north and south façades of the structure (see Figure
6-34). Each holding cell has 2 metal bunk beds and measures approximately 1.5 by 1.5 m (5.0
by 5.0 ft). Each set of 3 holding cells in controlled by a lever lock system located in rectangular
boxes along the eastern façade of the structure. This lever lock system has a patent date of
1874 (Figures 6-37 and 6-38). As mentioned in the Archival Research chapter, the jail was
bought and moved onto the property in the early to mid-1960s as part of the Comanche Gap
Historical Park. The original location of Structure J is unknown.
Structure K is located approximately 5.0 m (16.4 ft) to the north of Structure J (see
Figure 6-3). This structure is comprised of a wood frame, wood siding, and a corrugated metal
roof (Figure 6-39). Two solid wooden doors were observed on the northern and southern
façades of the structure. Based upon the location and the surrounding structures, it appears
that Structure K was likely constructed in the mid-1960s to early 1970s. The original function of
the Structure K is unknown; however, it currently functions as a storage facility.
Structure L, covered in dense vegetation, is located approximately 5.0 m (16.4 ft) north
of Structure K (see Figure 6-3). Structure L is has a square footprint that measures 1.8 by
1.8 m (6.0 by 6.0 ft). The structure is constructed from corrugated metal siding with a slanted
metal roof (Figure 6-40). Due to the dense vegetation surrounding the structure, the structure’s

interior could not be assessed. Based upon the location and the surrounding structures, it
appears that Structure E was constructed in the early to mid-1960s.
Structures M, N, O, and P comprise the remnants of the historic-era zoo observed on
site 41BL1366. Structure M, located approximately 25.0 m (82.0 ft) to the southeast of
Structure J, measures 1.8 by 6.7 m (6.0 by 12.0 ft). This structure is partly recessed
approximately 1.2 to 1.5 m (4.0 to 5.0 ft) into the modern ground surface with an additional
1.2 m (4.0 ft) placed above the modern ground surface (Figure 6-41). Structure M is
constructed of cement blocks and covered with wood planks and mesh wire. The structure is
sheltered by a wood frame and corrugated metal roof supported on cedar posts. According to
Steve Alford, Structure M was used as a reptile enclosure (Alford 2013).
Structure N is located approximately 10.m (32.8 ft) to the south of Structure M (see
Figure 6-3). This structure has a rectangular footprint that measures approximately 4.5 by
6.0 m (15.0 by 20.0 ft). The western portion of the structure is constructed of corrugated metal
wood planks, while the eastern portion is enclosed on all sides by chain-link fencing
(Figure 6-42). Structure N functioned as an animal enclosure.
Structures O and P are located approximately 10.m (32.8 ft) to the northeast of
Structure N (see Figure 6-3). These 2 structures, situated adjacent to one another, are each
constructed primarily of wood planks, corrugated metal siding, and poultry netting (Figures 6-43
to 6-45). Structure O measures approximately 3.0 by 7.6 m (10.0 by 25.0 ft), while Structure P
measures approximately 4.5 by 6.0 m (15.0 by 20.0 ft). Structure P also has a 7.6-by-7.6-m
(25.0-by-25.0-ft) wire and cedar post fence along the east portion of the structure. Both of these
structures functioned as animal enclosures; however, the type of animals housed in these
structures is unknown.
In additional to the latter 4 structures (Structures M to P), an animal trough, wooden
information board, and numerous wire enclosures were observed in proximity to the zoo
structures.
The animal trough is composed of a shallow, concrete basin measuring
approximately 1.0 m (3.3 ft) in diameter (Figure 6-46). The wooden information stand measures
approximately 2.0 by 0.5 m (7.0 by 1.5 ft) and stands approximately 1.0 m (3.3 ft) in height
(Figure 6-47). The flat, slanted surface along the top of the feature likely contained a
description of the animals housed within the zoo.
Structures Q and R are separated from the abovementioned structures by a wooden
bridge (Figures 6-48 and 6-49). Structure Q consists of a wood frame and corrugated metal
pavilion located near the center of site 41BL1366 (see Figures 6-2 and 6-3). The pavilion has a
rectangular footprint that measures approximately 6.1 by 12.2 m (20.0 by 40.0 ft) (Figure 6-50).
Approximately 8 modern picnic tables are located under the shelter of the pavilion.
According to accounts from the previous and current landowners, this pavilion was constructed
in the late 1970s or early 1980s. Structure Q functions as the location for the annual Medicine
Man Awards, started by Bill Alford in 1979.

Structure R is located approximately 5.0 m (16.4 ft) to the east of Structure Q (see
Figure 6-3). This structure, constructed of corrugated metal, has a rectangular footprint and
measures approximately 1.8 by 3.0 m (6.0 by 10.0 ft) (Figure 6-51). A single wooden door is
located on the structure’s southern façade, and 2 large, wooden hinge windows are present on
the western façade. Structure R appears to function as a concession stand and likely dates to
the construction of Structure Q.
Three fire pits and a plastic and canvas teepee were observed in proximity to
Structures Q and R (see Figure 6-3). The 3 fire pits are constructed of cement mortar limestone
blocks and each measure approximately 1.0 by 1.0 m (3.3 by 3.3 ft) (Figure 6-52). The teepee,
measuring approximately 1.5 m (5.0 ft) in diameter, is constructed of a cedar post frame with a
plastic and canvas covering (Figure 6-53). The teepee and fire pits appear to be contemporary
with the construction of the Medicine Man (Structure R) pavilion.
Structure S is the southernmost structure observed on site 41BL1366 (see Figure 6-2).
This recent structure has a rectangular footprint measuring approximately (30.0 by 40.0 ft). The
structure is constructed of a wood frame, brick masonry veneer, and asphalt shingle (Figures 654 to 6-58). It is estimated that this structure was constructed in the late 1970s to early 1980s.
Structure S functions as a private residence but is currently unoccupied.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface and in
shovel tests, site 41BL1366 measures approximately 600.0 m (1,968.0 ft) northeast to
southwest by 160.0 m (254.8 ft) northwest to southeast. Site boundaries were documented only
within the Project Area. The historic-era component of site 41BL1366 was fully documented,
while undocumented portions of the aboriginal component of the site may extend to the east
and south beyond the current Project Area.
A total of 23 shovel tests excavated on site 41BL1366 revealed up to 65.0 cm (25.6 in)
of yellowish-brown to dark grayish-brown silty clay loam and gravelly clay loam overlying very
dark grayish-brown silty clay and bedrock. Cultural materials were observed in the upper 20.0
cm (7.9 in) of sediments in 5 of the 23 shovel tests excavated on the site; however, cultural
materials are predominantly restricted to the modern ground surface.
Chain of Title Research
A chain of ownership for the parcel on which site 41BL1366 is located was not available
for review at this time. A search for the surname of the previous property owner, Bill Alford, on
the Handbook of Texas Online revealed no persons of historical significance associated with
this surname. Additionally, no historically significant events are known to have occurred at the
location of site 41BL1366 or in association with the Alford surname.

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

Site Summary
Site 41BL1366 represents the remains of a multiple-component site consisting of a
scatter of non-diagnostic aboriginal lithic artifacts, a historic-era amusement park, and a
homestead located at the base of a prominent upland formation just to the northeast of an
unnamed tributary feeder to the Lampasas River. The historic-era component of the site likely
dates to the mid-1960s, while the date of the aboriginal component of site 41L1366 could not be
determined. The site consists of 16 historic-era structures, 3 modern structures, 1 trash pile,
3 modern fire pits, a low-density scatter of historic-era trash, and a high-density scatter of nondiagnostic aboriginal lithic artifacts. Cultural materials were found in shallow subsurface
contexts (approximately 20.0 cm [7.9 in]) in 5 of the 23 shovel tests excavated on the site;
however, cultural materials are primarily restricted to the modern ground surface. As the site
boundaries were delineated only within the current Project Area, the aboriginal component of
site 41BL1366 may extend east and south of the boundaries of the proposed Project Area.
As the entire extent of the aboriginal component of site 41BL1366 was not assessed, its
overall eligibility for formal designation as an SAL remains undetermined. However, the
aboriginal materials within the proposed Project Area consist only of a moderate- to high-density
scatter of non-diagnostic lithic specimens on the modern ground surface and in shallow
subsurface contexts. The provenience of the Archaic point collection observed in the modern
house on site 41BL1366 is unknown, therefore it is not possible to determine if the collection is
associated with the aboriginal component of the site. Based upon the lack of temporally
diagnostic stone tools, preserved floral/faunal remains, or stratified, buried cultural deposits, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the aboriginal portion of site 41BL1366 within the current Project Area is
considered to be a noncontributing element to the site’s overall eligibility for formal designation
as an SAL. As such, no additional investigations are recommended for the aboriginal
component of site 41BL1366 in connection with the proposed undertaking.
The historic-era component of site 41BL1366 consists of 16 historic-era structures, of
which 13 structures are still standing. Archival research indicated that site 41BL1366
represents the location of the 1960s Comanche Gap Historical Park, which included a museum
(Structure B), a jail (Structure J), a zoo (Structures N to P), and a concession stand (Structure
H). However, the structures associated with the amusement park on site 41BL1366 retain little
architectural integrity, which diminishes from the integrity of setting, feeling, and association of
how the amusement park once functioned as a whole. The standing house structure (Structure
C) observed on site 41BL1366 does not embody a unique method of construction for a 1960s
home. The remaining standing structures (Structures D, E, G, K, and L) observed on site
41BL1366 are small outbuildings, and the exact function of each structure is unknown.
However, these 5 outbuildings do not possess a unique method of construction and lack
integrity. In addition to the site’s lack of architectural integrity, the historic-era component of site
41BL1366 also lacks intact archeological cultural deposits. Because of this, it is Horizon’s
opinion that the historic-era component of site 41BL1366 is considered ineligible for formal
designation as an SAL. As such, no additional investigations are recommended for the historicera component of site 41BL1366 in connection with the proposed undertaking.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for designation
as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their SAL
evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the Project Area and to make preliminary determinations of whether or
not the resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state
and/or federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with
important historic events and/or personages.
Under the Antiquities Code of Texas,
archeological resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the
significance of archeological resources for designation as SALs.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory
process.

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ARCHEOLOGICAL LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are
located in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any
county, city, or political subdivision of the state are state archeological landmarks and are
eligible for designation.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under
Section 26.8 of Part 2 of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may
designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

7.3

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

The survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1 new archeological site
(41BL1366). Site 41BL1366 consists of a multiple-component site, including a mid- to late-20thcentury amusement park, homestead, and a scatter of non-diagnostic aboriginal lithic artifacts
situated along a ridge to the southeast of an unnamed tributary feeder to the Lampasas River.
A total of 23 shovel tests were excavated on site 41BL1366. Of these, only 5 produced
evidence of shallow cultural deposits. The remaining 18 shovel tests produced negative results,
with the bulk of the cultural materials on site 41BL1366 observed in surface contexts. The site
encompasses all but the extreme northwestern portion of the Project Area. The aboriginal
component of the site may extend to the east and south beyond the Project Area’s eastern and
southern boundaries. As such, the boundaries of the aboriginal component of site 41BL1366
were not fully documented.

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the development of the Project Area will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources considered eligible for formal designation as SALs. The aboriginal
component of site 41BL1366 that falls within the current Project Area is recommended as a
noncontributing element to the site’s overall eligibility for formal designation as an SAL, while
the historic-era component of the site is recommended as ineligible for formal designation as an
SAL. With this in mind, no additional investigations are recommended on site 41BL1366 in
connection with the proposed undertaking. Horizon recommends that the City of Harker Heights
be allowed to proceed with the proposed Comanche Gap Park Project, relative to the jurisdiction
of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains
or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of
the discovery should cease immediately and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
