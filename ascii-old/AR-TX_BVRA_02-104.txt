ABSTRACT
A Phase I cultural resources investigation of a 9.8 acre tract in central Jasper
County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates of Bryan, Texas
in June 2002. No prehistoric archaeological sites were found to exist within the project
area. The soil consisted of a shallow fine sandy loam over yellow clay containing iron
nodules and pebbles. Overall, the 9.8 acre tract was determined to be a very low
probability area for the occurrence of prehistoric sites. According to the landowner,
several 19th century houses were once located to the north of the project area; however
permission to examine this area was not granted. The only evidence of historic
utilization observed in the project area was the remains of a fuel oil tank and a cooling
tank. Archival research revealed the tanks were originally owned by the Magnolia
Pipeline Company and were constructed in the late 1930s. Since no significant
archaeological sites were found, it is recommended that construction be allowed to
proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
An archaeological survey of a 9.8 acre tract within the city limits of Kirbyville,
Texas (Figure 1) was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on
June 5, 2002. The City is considering acquisition of the southwest corner of the 21.60
acre H. P. Woods tract for construction of a new water well (Figure 2). The actual
ground disturbance or permanent easement will only affect an area about 300 feet in
diameter. An unnamed tributary of Pin Oak Creek is approximately 100 meters
southwest of the project area; the main channel of the creek is approximately 600
meters to the south. Although the tract examined is mainly open pasture, native stands
of Chinese tallow trees were observed around the former petroleum storage tank sites
and along fence lines. The terrain is generally flat with crawfish holes evident in the
eastern section. The current project area is depicted on the 7.5' United States
Geological Survey topographical map Kirbyville (Provisional Edition 1984 - map number
3093-323) (Figure 3). The project number assigned by BVRA is 02-10.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Jasper County is situated
within the Southeast Texas archeological study region. In 1985, according to a
statistical overview prepared by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al.
1985:151), Jasper County contained 86 recorded sites. The site files at TARL revealed
149 recorded sites at the time of this survey. In 1985, 0 sites in the county had been
excavated, 10 had been tested by hand, 1 had been tested by machine, and 73 had
been surface collected. Twenty-three recorded prehistoric sites in the county were
listed as Archaic and 54 sites were listed as Late Prehistoric (Biesaart et al. 1985:151).
One site contained burials.
In the volume by (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.3) an evaluation was
made regarding density of sites in Texas counties. At this time Jasper County was next
to last with 0.001 - 0.1 sites per square mile. In 1993, Jasper County contained 99
recorded archaeological sites. Of this number, 27 were regarded as not significant, 62
were of unknown significance, 9 were probably significant, and 1 was considered to be
significant according to National Register criteria (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table
2.1.1).
Unfortunately, there are major forces that continue to threaten the integrity of
archaeological sites in Jasper County. These include population growth (City of Jasper
and surrounding area), highway construction, Sam Rayburn Reservoir (formerly McGee
Bend), and the lumbering industry.
Although private contract archaeology firms have played a part, most of the
archaeological sites known to exist in Jasper County have been identified by surveys
associated with reservoir construction and in house projects by National Forest
personnel. The earliest archaeological research in the area was performed in the late
1930s and early 1940s by researchers from The University of Texas at Austin. At that
time prehistoric cemeteries and mound sites were considered to be of primary
importance. From the late 1940s until the mid 1970s, most of the archaeological
research in East Texas was carried out in connection with reservoir construction. In
1948, for example, Robert L. Stephenson published the results of his work at the
proposed McGee Bend Reservoir in Angelina, Jasper, Nacogdoches, Sabine, and San
Augustine counties (Stephenson 1948a, 1948b). At the time this was the only
systematic professional major archaeological investigation in the county. Since that
time several studies regarding reservoirs such as Dam "B" (Stephenson 1949), Big Cow
Creek (Moir n.d.), and Rockland Lake (Prikryl (1987) have been published.

It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Jasper County, especially when numerous contract reports are available.
The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al. 1985), the
planning document published by the Texas Historical Commission (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993), other reports cited above, and the Abstracts in Contract Archaeology
series also published by the Texas Historical Commission for more detailed information
regarding the archaeology of Jasper County.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a records check was conducted for BVRA by Jean
Hughes, Assistant Curator of Records, at TARL. Ms. Hughes checked the site files for
previously recorded sites in the project area. In addition, information pertaining to
previous archaeological work in the region was obtained from the library at BVRA. The
field survey crew relied on the topographic map Kirbyville and the soils book for Jasper
County (Neitsch 1982). The method utilized to assess the 9.8 acres consisted of shovel
tests and a surface inspection of exposed areas.
The field survey crew walked over the entire project area in approximate 30
meter intervals excavating shovel tests randomly along the way. In all, 8 tests were
dug. All earth excavated through shovel testing was screened using 1/4" hardware
cloth, and a shovel test log (Appendix I) was kept. Profiles of the shovel tests were
sketched in the field, and the tests were drawn on a project area map (Figure 2).
Unfortunately, some of the project area boundaries were not staked prior to this survey.
The crew relied on the landowner, Paul Woods, for this information.
According to Mr. Woods, there used to be several standing structures to the
north of the current project area. He pointed out a well that he claimed was hand-dug.
According to the Mayor, we did not have permission to be on that tract of land as part of
this project. The well was obscured by vegetation and trash placed there by the
landowner to keep animals from falling in it. We observed the condition of the well while
on our way to the project area.
Since the only historic structures in the project area consisted of earthen berms
that previously enclosed a fuel oil tank and a compressor and a cooling pond, archival
work was conducted to establish the chain of title for these features.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check at TARL revealed no previously recorded archaeological sites
in the project area, and no significant archaeological sites were found during this
investigation. The area surveyed consisted of "loamy soils of the flatwoods" as defined
by the soil survey for Jasper County (Neitsch 1982:General Soil Map). The soils in the
project area are defined by Neitsch (1982:Sheet 96) as the Malbis-Kirbyville
association, gently undulating (MKB). These are deep loamy soils on uplands on broad
areas that have a slightly mounded surface. The surface layer of these soils varies
between 5 and 12 inches thick. Malbis soils are moderately well drained, and Kirbyville
soils are somewhat poorly drained (Neitsch 1982:31). Shovel testing, however,
revealed a different picture. Of the eight tests excavated, only one (ST 2) contained fine
sandy loam to a depth of 20 cm where yellow clay with iron nodules and gravels was
encountered (Appendix I). The remainder of the tests was terminated at an average
depth of 10 cm.
The greatest impact to the landscape in the project area was observed in the
form of the remains of a fuel oil tank for the storage of diesel fuel in the northwest
section of the property and a cooling tank in the eastern section of the property (see
Figure 2). The field examination found that the only evidence of the fuel oil tank
remaining is the earthen berm. At the site of the cooling tank, however, a concrete
foundation for an engine and compressor was found within the earthen berm at this
location. Neither of the fuel tank areas was measured and is depicted not to scale in
Figure 2. Since shovel tests in the immediate area of these tanks revealed soils more
shallow than described in the soil survey, it is hypothesized that the soils used to
construct the berms may have been taken from this area. In addition, a linear
depression that was probably a water line (Dixon Conn, Jr., personal communication),
and an undulating surface caused by plowing when the area was cultivated were noted.
Archival research documented that the Magnolia Pipeline Company constructed the
historic features in the late 1930s. According to the Mayor, the tank and the
compressor were removed in 1955 following abandonment of the facility.
According to the landowner (personal communication, June 5, 2002), there were
standing structures to the north of the 9.8 acre tract during the early 20th century, but
they were moved many years ago. The only evidence of this historic occupation
observed was a hand-dug well just outside the project area. No historic artifacts were
found on the surface or in any of the shovel tests.

RECOMMENDATIONS
BVRA recommends that the City of Kirbyville be allowed to proceed with
construction of the water well as planned. It is the opinion of BVRA that no significant
archaeological sites were missed during the examination of the 9.8 acre tract. Should,
however, cultural materials be exposed during construction, all work should cease until
the situation can be evaluated by the Texas Historical Commission in consultation with
the City of Kirbyville and Brazos Valley Research Associates.
