Paleoindians of Texas:
An Update on the Texas Clovis
Fluted Point Survey
David J. Meltzer and Michael R. Bever

ABSTRACT
Since the initial report of a statewide survey of 205 Texas Clovis fluted points (Meltzer 1986, 1987), an
additional 201 Clovis points have been recorded. These additional records come from 33 counties not previously
represented in the survey; they enhance, but do not appreciably change, the spatial distributional patterns
observed earlier with the smaller sample. The density of these points vary across the state and by region. Most
of these Clovis points occur in surface scatters with archeological materials of later age; many are otherwise
Clovis isolates; a relatively few occur in sites. These contextual patterns vary by region, and suggest differences
in land use. The majority of the points are made of Edwards formation chert; the minority are fashioned of
Alibates agatized dolomite and Tecovas jasper; rare specimens occur made of Dakota quartzite, and a few other
materials. Raw material use varies by region as well. Texas Clovis fluted points vary in their morphology and
along certain dimensions--notably length and width--but that variation is attributable to reworking and
breakage. Other dimensions (basal width and fluting thickness) in contrast are tightly constrained, indicating
considerable standardization in the manufacture of these points, perhaps to fit pre-existing hafts. These and other
morphometric data shed some light on the technology of fluted point manufacture. Most of the Clovis points in
the sample are whole, but over 100 show distinct breakage or reworking patterns, which cluster to a degree by
region, and provide clues to point function and life histories. Data on Texas Clovis fluted points continue to yield
insight into Clovis adaptations.

INTRODUCTION
Some 15 years ago, Story (1981:142) observed
that our views of the Clovis occupation of Texas
were based more on speculation than substance. It
was partly in an effort to put our understanding of
Clovis on firmer ground that Meltzer (1986, 1987,
1989a) subsequently undertook the Texas Clovis
Fluted Point Survey (hereafter, TCFPS), a systematic survey aimed at determining the number, density, distribution, and variability of Clovis fluted
points across the state.
That survey was not the first of its kind. In the
1960s Thomas Hester and in the early 1980s, Elton
Prewitt, each initiated similar efforts; their examination of published and unpublished reports and
collections netted information on some 50 Clovis
points scattered in 31 counties (Meltzer 1987:34),
but unfortunately neither study was published. However, both Hester and Prewitt graciously provided
their results to Meltzer, and his TCFPS built on
their foundation by updating records on all known

and published Clovis fluted point occurrences, and
then by actively seeking data from individuals and
collections (public and private) across the state-much of which came as a result of a questionnaire
sent to the membership of the Texas Archeological
Society (Meltzer 1987:29).
The initial results of the TCFPS were
considerable: 205 Clovis fluted points were recorded
from 95 counties across the state. Those data
provided a measure of the density and distribution
of Clovis points across the state, insight into Clovis
land use, fluted point technology and function, and
some measure of Clovis subsistence, settlement,
and adaptation.
After the initia! results of the TCFPS were
published (Meltzer 1986, 1987), more records of
Texas Clovis fluted points accumulated. A very
brief update was published a few years later (Meltzer
1989a), but nothing has appeared since then, despite the fact that the sample is nearly double what
it was in 1986 (Table t), thanks to the continued
interest and cooperation of individuals across the

state. Now, as nearly a decade has passed since the
initial report was published, it is time to present a
detailed update of the TCFPS.
As before, this discussion will cover several
areas: the spatial distribution of Texas Clovis fluted
points; patterns in raw material use; their technology, form, and function; and what these data reveal
of Clovis adaptations and land use patterns. In addition, now that a survey of Texas Folsom points
has appeared (Largent et al. 1991; Largent 1995),
we will take the opportunity to examine to what
degree, if any, the distribution and patterning of
Clovis and Folsom differed, and what changes that
might reveal in Paleoindian adaptive strategies.

PARAMETERS OF THE TCFPS DATA
Boundaries, sources, and analytical units
We open with the caveat--the reminder, really--that there is an element of arbitrariness in
examining the distribution of fluted points within
the state of Texas. The stateâs borders are not entirely "natural." And even those portions that are
(the Red River on the north, the Sabine River on the
east, and the Rio Grande on the south) were unlikely
to have been significant barriers to Clovis huntergatherers, wide-ranging and mobile as they were.
Complicating the picture further is the great
diversity of environments across the state, not all of
which are contained within the state (in effect, several ecological zones intersect, but are not isomorphic with, the boundaries of Texas). We now know
not all Clovis was alike: it varied, and not just on a
continental scale, but regionally as well (Meltzer
1993a). Moreover, because Clovis land use was
likely tied to particular ecological niches (and not,
obviously, to modern state lines), groups occupying those niches might on the face of it be expected
to have very different adaptive strategies than those
in other niches.
In effect, we must anticipate the possibility that
not all Texas Clovis points in all regions of the state
!ook alike or were alike. The Clovis record on, say,
the High Plains of Texas almost surely had more in
common with Clovis on the High Plains generally,
than with Clovis in the East Texas forests. Such
would be true of any state in North America, but
seems especially true of one as large and varied as
Texas. A pan-regional approach is clearly needed to
truly understand the potential Clovis Paleoindian
occupations of Texas, but so far comparable data

are not readily available for the adjoining states and
regions (they are starting to become available
[Faught et al. 1994; Hofman and Wyckoff 1991]).
So we start with Texas, but within the state also
recognize, and use, the major geographical provinces of the state: the Plains/Panhandle, North Central, East, Coast, Southwest, Trans-Pecos, and
Central Texas regions. This partitioning follows
Suhm et al. (1954), with modifications from
Arbingast et al. (1976) and Brown et al. (1982), and
is in keeping with the divisions used in the original
report and with other studies (e.g., Largent et al.
1991; Largent 1995). However, in order to incorporate site distributional data from Biesaart et al.
(1985), their finer-scale regional divisions will also
on occasion be used (as noted below).
The bulk of the data in the TCFPS comes
from individual and institutional collections; the
remainder is from published sources. In all
instances, a form (Appendix A) was used to record
information on fluted point size and shape and
other attributes that might inform on point function,
technology, and style (Figure 1). Data was also
recorded on point location, the context in which it
was found (and what kinds of archeological
material of what ages was found with it), and the
raw material of which it was made. As before,
many of those forms were completed with the help
and cooperation of scores of interested individuals
(see Acknowledgments).
In some cases, particularly among the published sources, the morphological, metrical, and
technological data sought for this analysis were not
available, and hence it might have only been possible to record, for instance, that a fluted point was
present in a particular county, and little beyond
that. Still, even knowing fluted points were present
in a county is very useful for helping fill in the
statewide distribution map. It means, of course, we
know of more fluted point occurrences than we
have specific attribute data for those points.
The study of Clovis point distribution is based
largely on the presence and/or number of points by
county. The county serves as the basic mapping
unit since it is almost always known and recorded;
often, more precise location information is unavailable or unknown. Because the county is the most
common spatial denominator used in recording
Clovis finds, using it ensures that uneven details in
available locational data do not unduly influence
the analysis (Mettzer 1987:31). Counties also have
the virtue of being easily mapped, clustered into

largely unchanged (as we discuss in detail
below). Such congruence would be unlikely
were this sample unrepresentative of the
underlying population of Texas Clovis
points.
We would hasten to add, however, there
is one obvious bias in the sample, in that it
has disproportionately more complete
points and point bases than point tips. This
comes as little surprise: Clovis point tips,
as well as medial blade fragments or other
broken point sections lacking the diagnostic flute scars or the other distinctive Clovis
attributes (Bradley 1993:253-254), will not

but few TAS members and vice versa (Meltzer

changes in TAS membership have produced different tallies of each category, but not enough to bring
about a correlation between the two. Moreover,
there is not a significant correlation between numbers of Clovis points and people per county. 1 Whatever the distribution of Clovis points may reflect, it
is not merely an artifact of the present distribution
of people in Texas. We will comment on other
matters of potential bias below.

SPATIAL PATTERNS IN TEXAS CLOVIS
FLUTED POINT DISTRIBUTIONS

Current Totals and Changes since 1986
by County and Region
We have now recorded 406 Clovis fluted points
for the state of Texas (see Table 1), representing
nearly a two-fold increase over the 205 points reported in the original TCFPS (Meltzer 1987:Table
1). The additional 201 Clovis points come from 70
counties, 33 of which were not represented in the
original survey. Presently, Clovis points are known
from 128 of Texasâ 254 counties (Figure 2; previously, only 95 counties were represented).

Figure 2. Occurrence of Texas Clovis fluted points by
county.

53

Almost 30 percent (60/201) of the increase in
the number of fluted points between 1986 and 1995
comes from the McFaddin Beach locality in Jefferson
County on the central Gulf Coast. McFaddin Beach
is a lengthy (ca. 35 km) stretch of the central Gulf
Coast regularly littered by Clovis points and Pleistocene fossils that have washed ashore over decades
from a source or sources apparently near the present
coastline (but which during the Pleistocene were
inland areas some 80 km from the coast [Long 1977;
Turner and Tanner 1994:323]). This locality has
lately been the subject of considerable interest and
yield (Hester et al. 1992), and at present 70 Clovis
points are known from it (Turner and Tanner
1994:324). This is a seven-fold increase over the
previous total of 10 (Meltzer 1987:Table 1), and an
increase far larger in relative and absolute terms
than in any other county.
Atascosa, Briscoe, and Dawson counties had
comparable relative increases, however. In fact, excluding the Jefferson County total, the average gain
per county between 1986 and 1995 was 1.11; including Jefferson County, the average gain per
county over that same period is 1.57.
In the current TCFPS sample, the average number of points per county is 3.16 (data from Table 1).
For reasons just noted, and as was evident in the
original TCFPS report (Meltzer 1987:36), using an
average value is somewhat misleading, inflated as
it is by the high numbers of points in just a few
counties. As can be seen in Table 2, the modal
distribution--the number of Clovis fluted points by
county--is more meaningful, revealing as it does
that the majority of Texas counties have just one or
two Clovis points.
The changes in county tallies between the 1986
and 1995 TCFPS samples are mirrored in changes
in point frequencies in the larger geographical regions (Table 3). All seven of those regions showed
an increase in the number of Clovis points between
1986 and 1995. However, in most regions the increase, although substantial, generally resulted in
no more than a doubling of the recorded occurrences of Clovis points.
Naturally, in the Coast region the increase from
1986 to 1995 was considerably greater (over three
times larger than in any other region). Again, this
spike is attributable to the singular contribution of

IThe analysis used ! 990 county population data provided in Kingston ( 1993:331-336). Because these data are on a ratio scale
it was possible to derive a Pearsonâs correlation coefficient between the numbers of Clovis points and Log ~o population, and the
resulting value was. 1648, with a significance of .051.

McFaddin Beach, which makes it appear there was
a more extensive Clovis record in this region than
actually exists.
The Regional Density of Clovis Points
Just how extensive that effect is can be seen
more clearly in the density of points in this and the
other regions. The overall density of Clovis fluted
points across the state is just over 15 per 10,000
square miles (Table 4). In four of the separate regions of the state, the Plains/Panhandle, East
Texas, Southwest Texas, and Central Texas, density values are roughly comparable, ranging from
12-17 points per 10,000 mi2 (Table 4). In two regions-North Central Texas and the Trans-Pecos-the densities of Clovis materials are considerably
lower, while in the Texas Coast densities are con-

siderably higher (39 points per 10,000 mi2), for
reasons already detailed.
To assess whether Clovis points are distributed evenly among the regions, we can calculate
the degree of difference between the actual number
of points in a given region and the number of points
expected in that region were that number proportional to the regionâs area (that is, test the proposition that larger regions have more points, and
smaller regions, fewer points [see Largent et al.
1991:Table 4]). Expected frequencies are derived
by multiplying each regionâs percentage of the
stateâs total area with the total number of points.
Thus, as the Plains/Panhandle represents 25 percent of the total area of the state of Texas, it is
expected to have 25 percent of the total number of
the stateâs Clovis fluted points (in this case, roughly
100 points [0.25 x 406 points]).

The calculated chi-square2 statistic in Table 4
indicates the expected and observed values are
significantly different, showing that indeed fluted
point densities across the state are not uniform. The
standardized residuals provide a measure of just
how far the observed and expected values diverge
from each other. In some regions of the state, most
especially the Coast, the density of fluted points is
far higher than expected for a region of that size.

Statewide Frequency Distribution
of Clovis Fluted Points
Not surprisingly, then, the statewide map of
the frequency of Clovis fluted points by county
(Figure 3) is rather uneven: just as it was in 1986
(compare Figure 3 here with Figure 2 in Meltzer
[1987]). The 1986 and 1995 maps are also somewhat alike, largely because, as noted, Clovis points

added to the TCFPS since 1986 were distributed
across the state roughly proportional to their abundance in the original sample (with the exceptions
noted). Given this, it is appropriate to frame our
discussion in terms of the six broad spatial patterns
noted previously (Meltzer 1987:41-42), to assess
whether and how those have changed, remained the
same, or been enhanced by the additional data.
(1) There is an apparent concentration of
Clovis points in the Plains/Panhandle region,
and specifically in the High Plains region
(Meltzer 1987:41). In the current TCFPS map,
there is still a high frequency of Clovis points on
the High Plains. Indeed, eight of the High Plains
counties that did not previously have records of
Clovis points have them now. Overall, adjusting for
the McFaddin Beach Effect, the Plains has the
greatest density of Clovis material of any area of

z The chi-square statistic measures the degree of difference between an observed and an expected value. In the case of this 1
x 7 cell table, the expected values are derived from data beyond that contained in the table itself (as noted in the text). More
typically, and this is true of the 2 x 2 and larger (r x c) tables below, expected values are derived by multiplying row and column
totals, then dividing the product by the overall total. This provides a probabilistic "best estimate" of the number that ought to be
in that particular cell, based on the data within the table. The chi-square statistic then measures the magnitude of the difference
between the observed and expected values, and whether that difference is more than would be expected by chance (Everitt
1977:7).

represent the number of points recorded per county, except in the case of Jefferson County (the
high spike on the Texas Gulf Coast). Were the 70 Clovis points from Jefferson County plotted,
the resulting peak would proportionately reduce all the other county peaks, thus making the
statewide patterns difficult to discern. For this figure, then, the Jefferson County total was
arbitrarily set at 25. All other values represent the actual recorded totals.

the state (see Table 4).
The high frequency of Clovis material on the
Plains was earlier attributed to brisk archeological
attention (owing to the early recognition of several
important Clovis sites on this landscape), and to the
high surface visibility of archeological remains
(owing to this being a largely treeless landscape
where current land use practices regularly expose
subsurface archeological material). It seems just as
likely, however, that the abundance of Clovis age
material here is no sampling fluke: this area was
intensely occupied by Clovis groups. The Plains in
Late Pleistocene times overall was wetter and cooler
than today (effective precipitation was higher,
whether because of increased precipitation,
decreased evaporation, changes in seasonality or

some combination thereof is unknown), and mantled
by grasses, composites, chenopods, as well as some
artemisia (sage) and Ephedra (Mormon tea) in the
uplands, and open forest or wooded parkland in
low-lying and wetter areas (Bryant and Holloway
1985). Antelope and bison grazed the landscape
alongside the occasional mammoth. The abundant
freshwater lakes that dotted the landscape (Sabin
and Holliday 1995), and the spring-fed ponds (like
the Clovis type site and Lubbock Lake), would
have been a prime attraction to human foragers,
and many Clovis points are found alongside these
now dry features (Meltzer, unpublished). Haynes
(1991) raises the possibility these features may also
have been dry in Clovis times--that there was a
Clovis-age drought. However, Hollidayâ s extensive

Meltzer and Bever ~ Paleoindians of Texas
sediment coting and stratigraphic study on the High
Plains of West Texas and eastern New Mexico has
not found evidence to support the hypothesis of a
Clovis drought (Holliday 1995). Regardless, the
conclusion that Clovis groups more intensely
occupied this area, as opposed to other regions of
the state, must remain tentative until such time as
those other regions have been as thoroughly
searched for Clovis remains.
2) There is a relative absence of Clovis
points on the Lower or Rolling Plains (Brown
et al. 1982), with Clovis points scarce in a 60
mile wide and nearly 400 mile long north-south
swath just to the east and down off of the Llano
Estacado or High Plains (Meltzer 1987:41). Despite the large increase in the TCFPS sample since
the original survey, the Rolling Plains remains an
archeological "empty corridor," at least in regard
to Clovis remains (for that matter, Folsom points
occur in relatively fewer numbers in this region as
well [Largent et al. 1991:324]). There may be several reasons for this. As earlier suggested (Meltzer
1987:43), aeolian and fluvial deposition off the
High Plains deeply buried, and thus rendered invisible, any Late Pleistocene surfaces and associated archeological records in this region, though
further work was needed on surface ages and the
amount of deposition in this region. Several papers
have since appeared that corroborate this suggestion (Blum et al. 1992; Blum and Valastro 1992;
Ferring 1995a). A particularly striking illustration
of the phenomenon is Baumgardnerâs report of a
surface just 2000 years old buried beneath seven
meters of sediment on the Rolling Plains
(Baumgardner 1986:20). Any Paleoindian-age occupational surfaces below such thick deposits will
not be readily visible archeologically (Meltzer
1987:43), assuming, that is, Paleoindian occupations preserve. The uplands and drainages of the
Rolling Plains have also been subject (especially
in certain settings) to high erosion and geomolphic
removal (Blum et al. 1992:362), which, with the
deep burial of preserved Clovis age surfaces, conspire to obscure if not destroy the archeological
record (Ferring 1995a; Holliday, 1995 personal
communication).
But the scarcity of Paleoindian material in this
region may not be wholly attributable to natural
formation processes preventing our access to the
archeological record. As Gustavson has observed,
the water in this region is only marginally potable:

57

the rivers that traverse the area carry large amounts
of salt (dissolved from Permian halite beds), and
have since long before Clovis groups arrived
(Gustavson et al. 1980:3-9, 33-35). The extremely
poor quality of the water may have influenced, if
not discouraged Clovis occupation in so far as good
water, and animals, may have been more accessible
elsewhere.
Still, current land use practices in the Rolling
Plains (large and relatively inaccessible ranches covered with plains and mesquite savanna) do not provide good exposures of Late Pleistocene surfaces
or opportunities for survey. Hence, it would be
premature to conclude Clovis groups did not occupy this area. Until such time as deep testing shows
the deeply buffed Pleistocene surfaces lack Clovis
remains, it is better to conclude on the side of
cautzion that this empty corridor in the Clovis record
results from inadequate exposures or insufficient
samples of surfaces of the proper age.
3) The Trans-Pecos region has the lowest
abundance and density of Clovis points in the
state (Meltzer 1987:42). That was true in 1986, and
it remains so today. Indeed, as evident in Table 4,
the density of fluted points in the Trans-Pecos is far
lower than would be expected for a region that size.
Again, the question of sampling adequacy arises:
will the region appear to have been peopled by
Clovis groups, once it has been thoroughly peopled
by archeologists? Thatâs a reasonable possibility,
in part because the Big Bend National Park and the
large size of ranches in the area have tended to
restrict access to the area.
Even so, there was an extensive surface survey of a 3500 km2 area of the Trans-Pecos around
Van Horn by Hedrick, which included an examination of several private projectile point collections, and the only Paleoindian material recorded
was a single Folsom point (Hedrick 1989:149). No
Clovis remains were noted (see also Collins 1976;
Mallouf 1981, 1985); later Paleoindian occupations are also only "scattered thinly" throughout
the region (Mallouf 1985:100). For that matter,
Clovis remains are equally rare in the Mexican
states of Chihuahua and Coahuila south of the international border (MacNeish and Nelken-Terner
1983). Thus, it may be the scarcity of Clovis remains in the Trans-Pecos is real, possibly a result
of harsh environmental circumstances (Mallouf
1985; Meltzer 1987:44). In this regard, it would be
useful to know whether there is evidence in this

58

Texas Archeological Society

region for Haynesâ posited Clovis-age drought
(Haynes 1991).
4) Clovis points occur with some frequency
and are rather evenly distributed in a slightly
elliptical trend of contiguous counties through
Central Texas, beginning in Uvalde County in
the southwest, and extending up to Bell county
in Central Texas (Meltzer 1987:42). This distributional pattern remains largely unchanged with the
presently available data. If anything, the arc now
extends farther to the north. For most of its length,
that elliptical distribution conforms to the eastern
edge of the Edwards Plateau (the Balcones Fault
line), along which were freshwater springs and extensive outcrops of Cretaceous age, chert-bearing,
limestone of the Fredericksburg (Edwards) Group.
These resources were likely a prime attraction to
Clovis groups and, as important, the exploitation of
the chert sources resulted in a dense and wellmarked archeological record (Meltzer 1987:44).
5) Clovis points appear, at first glance, to be
relatively scarce in the Coastal region; however,
there are concentrations of this material, and
some apparent areas of high versus low densities
of point materials (Meltzer 1987:42). That observation is colaâoborated statistically: analysis of residuals in a plot of Clovis points by Paleoindian
sites indicates there are significantly more isolates
in this region than would be expected.
The Clovis points from Southeast Texas
nearly all occur as surface finds along the Gulf
Coast shoreline (but mostly on McFaddin Beach).
At the time of the Clovis occupation, sea levels
were still lower than at present (although by then,
post-Pleistocene sea level rise had begun), the coast
was under what is now Gulf waters, and McFaddin
Beach was well inland. The materials that wash
ashore on McFaddin Beach today are from nowsubmerged source(s) on the continental shelf,
which in Clovis times were coastal plain or downstream river drainages (Meltzer 1987:35; Hester et
al. 1992; Turner and Tanner 1994). Since
McFaddin Beach is a secondary deposit of material washing ashore, and not the primary source of
the material, its point tally may underrepresent the
offshore record, in so far as some of the Clovis
points from the offshore source(s) almost certainly
have failed to make it to shore.
It may be the extraordinarily high numbers of
Clovis points from McFaddin Beach derive from
no more than a single, rich Clovis site or cache

offshore. On the face of it, however, several sources
would seem more likely, given the variation evident
in the morphology of these points; perhaps some of
the apparent clusters of a few, highly similar points
found close to one another (Turner and Tanner
1994:324) represent a single source. As to the nature
of the source, whether a camp site, kill site, or
cache, little can be said. It is perhaps worth noting
that the few known Clovis caches tend to comprise
not just finished points, but a wide technological
range of forms from large preforms down to points
(e.g., Frison 1991). Ultimately, determining the
extent and nature of the McFaddin Beach source
will have to wait more extensive work, possibly
including underwater survey (geophysical sounding
techniques might prove useful here). McFaddin
Beach aside, Patterson (1993:262) notes that Clovis
materials are relatively rare in this region.
6) There is an apparent abundance of Clovis
points recorded from East Texas (Meltzer
1987:42). In the earlier TCFPS, the abundance of
Clovis points from East and Northeast Texas was
referred to as "apparent" in light of the fact that
two-thirds of the recorded points had only minimal
documentation, and there seemed reason to doubt
that all the forms said to be Clovis were Clovis
(Meltzer 1987:46). It was suggested then the data
ought to be used with caution, until such time as
further work in the region corroborated the apparently high numbers of Clovis points.
That has now happened: several reports (Brown
1994; Perttula 1989; Story 1990) document in detail the presence and distribution of Clovis groups
in the region. That distribution is concentrated along
and near the Red River and in the Upper Trinity
drainage, as well as the North and South Sulphur
drainages (Perttula 1989:20; Story 1990:Figure 26).
The distribution may in part be attributable to the
active collecting of avocational groups (Perttula
1989:19; Story 1990:178), and to deep incision of
(and exposure of Pleistocene age deposits in) the
Sulphur River channel since the 1930s (Ferring,
personal communication, 1995). Because Clovisage surfaces in these large river valleys are now
deeply buried or removed by erosion, the Clovis
material tends to occur as isolates (rather than sites)
in upland and tributary settings (Perttula 1989:20;
Story 1990:182).
Both Story (1990:182) and Perttula (1989:21)
see Clovis groups in this region as having a broadbased diet, and foraging widely over this forested

MeItzer and Bever M Paleoindians of Texas

area. There is tantalizing, but unfortunately not well
documented, evidence that the Clovis point from
the multi-component Murphey site (Marion County,
Texas) was associated with mastodon bones (Story
1990:185). If that was the case, it would make this
locality one of the few in all of North America in
which Clovis was associated with mastodon (as
opposed to mammoth).
Moving slightly west into North Central Texas,
the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 1989, 1990;
Humphrey and Ferring 1994)--along with the
Lewisville site (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958;
Stanford et al. 1995)--are now filling in vital gaps
in the Clovis occupation of an area, an occupation
that is otherwise not well represented in the TCFPS.
The scarcity of Clovis age material in this area, as
in others, may be attributable to geologic processes
obscuring the archeological record, rather than an
absence of Clovis occupations.

Distribution of Clovis
and Folsom in Texas

Clovis, Folsom, and later Paleoindian occupations were traditionally thought to be similarly
adapted, and represented a continuous tradition of
big-game hunting that began with a focus on the
Pleistocene megafauna (mammoth and mastodon)
in Clovis times, and shifted to bison in Folsom and
later periods. In recent years, however, it has become clear the adaptive picture is far more complex, and that Clovis adaptations not only varied
across their range, but perhaps differed from those
of the Paleoindians who followed (Meltzer 1993a,
1993b).
Moreover, there is ample reason to doubt
Clovis groups were big-game hunters (of mastodon
or mammoth). More likely, they were generalized
hunter-gatherers who occasionally pursued biggame, but more often exploited smaller, less risky
prey. Like turtles. Turtle remains (and other small
game) appear with surprising regularity and abundance in Clovis sites (Meltzer 1993b), including
several in Texas such as Lewisville (Crook and
Harris !958; Stanford et al. 1995) and Aubrey
(Ferring 1990, 1995b). Our romantic image of specialized Clovis hunters moving in for the kill on a
trumpeting, rearing mammoth, may have to be replaced by one of Clovis foragers roasting turtles on
the half-shell, after a more leisurely and far less
dangerous hunt.

59

In contrast to Clovis, Folsom and later
Paleoindians (especially those on the Plains), were
more specialized hunter-gatherers, focusing on
bison, although theirs was not wholly a bison-diet
(see Hofman 1996). Given that contrast in
adaptation and the differences in land use that ought
to follow from that contrast, we would not expect a
strong correlation in the distribution of Clovis and
later Paleoindian localities. By and large, that proves
to be the case. Table 5 shows the correlation
between the numbers of Clovis and Folsom
occurrences, all Paleoindian sites, and all archeological sites (data on Folsom occurrences are from
Largent et al. [1991:Table 1]; data on Paleoindian
and all sites are from Biesaart et al. [1985]).
These results indicate that the distribution by
county of Clovis points is unrelated to the distribution of later Paleoindian sites: there is no correlation between the two (Spearmanâs rho, r~ =. 1508,
significance = .074, and even less between Clovis
points and all archeological sites). However, there
was a strong correlation between the number of
Paleoindian sites and the total number of sites by
county (1~ = .6621, significance = .000). Granting
biases in the collection and reporting of Clovis
points versus Paleoindian sites, one might attribute
the lack of correlation between the two to differential intensity of land use on the part of Clovis groups
(Meltzer 1987:36).
Yet, it is important to note this lack of correlation is partly an artifact of scale. Reanalysis of the
data using fewer and larger spatial units, namely the
environmental and geographic regions defined by
Biesaart et al. (1985:9, and Figure 15), shows there
is a significant correlation between the number of
Clovis isolates and Paleoindian sites by such regions (~ = .6999, significance = .008). This means,
in effect, that at a coarser spatial scale the Paleoindian
archeological record (and this includes Clovis) is
more generally homogeneous, as perhaps might be
expected given regions are larger and more
archeologically meaningful units than counties. From
this one might speculate that intra-state, inter-regional Paleoindian land use patterns were similar.
Taking the analysis a step further, what of the
relationship between Clovis and Folsom? After examining the correlation of Folsom localities with
severa! variables (including county population, area,
number of TAS members, and number of available
publications), Largent et al. (1991:330) conclude
the "best way to predict Folsom localities is to

know the number of Clovis points in a county."
Relative to the other measures they included in
their analysis, this may be so.
Yet, analyzing the correlation between Clovis
and Folsom points, using the updated TCFPS data,
reveals the relationship is, at best, a very weak one
(r~ = -.0445, significance = .622; the correlation
measured by Kendallâs Tau-B [to allow comparison with Largent et al.âs 1991 results] is -.0375,
significance = .593). In fact, unlike the Clovis distribution, the Folsom data do correlate, albeit
weakly, with the number of Paleoindian sites per
county (Table 5). Our analysis differs somewhat
from that of Largent et al. (1991), in so far as we
examined the correlation between the number of
Clovis and Folsom points per county, not the number of localities per county (as was apparently done
by Largent et al. 1991). Still, since there is a very
strong correlation between Folsom points and
Folsom localities by county (r~ = .9648, signifi-

cance = .000), the difference between our approaches may be more apparent than real (cf.
Largent et al. 1991:328). It seems, then, the Clovis
and Folsom records are not significantly alike, at
least in their frequency and spatial patterning.

THE ARCHEOLOGICAL CONTEXT OF
TEXAS CLOVIS FLUTED POINTS
Clovis fluted points recorded by the TCFPS
were found in several contexts (Table 6): as isolated
surface occurrences (isolates); in well defined (and
perhaps sealed) Clovis site contexts; and, in the
clear majority of those where the context was
known, in surface scatters amidst archeological
material of many different types and ages, including
Clovis, other Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric,
and even Historic material. Note that Table 6 shows
the number of individual points as well as number

Meltzer and Bever ~ Paleoindians of Texas
of localities within which those points occur (the
latter is included to offset the statistical effects of a
single locality having an inordinate number of
points, and will always be equal to or less than the
number of points). For nearly a third of the points,
the context was unknown, or at least insufficient
information was provided to make a secure
judgment, and we always preferred to err on the
side of caution, perhaps unduly so: TCFPS
respondents generally noted if other material was
present with a fluted point; the absence of such a
note provides some warrant to speculate that many
"unknown" points are, therefore, isolates. We did
not assume so in our analysis, however.
Them are a number of observations that might
be made of these data. For one, they highlight the
fact that discrete and well-defined Clovis sites are
rare, a point noted previously (Meltzer 1987:2728), and also observed in later Paleoindian
occupations elsewhere (e.g., Hofman 1996). Even
counting the surprising number of sites discovered
or reported since the initial TCFPS, notably Aubrey
(Ferring 1989, 1990; Humphrey and Feiâring 1994),
Pavo Real (Henderson and Goode 1991), Gault
(Collins et al. 1991, 1992), Poverty Hill (Meltzer,
unpublished; Parker 1983; Walter 1990), and
Yellow Hawk (Mallouf 1988, 1989), as well as the
Clovis sites already known--some of which were
recently subject to reinvestigation (e.g., Miami
[Holliday et al. 1994] and Wilson-Leonard [Collins

et al. 1993])--the essential fact that Texas Clovis
sites are rare remains unchanged. Which itself
reaffirms the importance of examining the
distribution of individual Clovis fluted points (and
not just sites) across the state.
But is that scarcity of sites itself meaningful,
perhaps suggestive of Clovis settlement activities
(Meltzer 1987:27-28), or is it simply an artifact of
an archeological record that has somehow made it
difficult to see once-intact Clovis sites? The latter
possibility might seem supported by the large
number of Clovis points that occur within surface
scatters, if one assumes those scatters also include
the debitage and tools from Clovis assemblages
that, unlike fluted points, are difficult to recognize
as Clovis.
However, the occurrence of Clovis points
within those larger surface scatters could result from
one of several causes, but precisely which causes
can be difficult to determine, especially from a
distance. For example, the occurrence of a Clovis
fluted point in a large surface scatter might indicate, as above, that a larger Clovis component was
once present at the locality, but by virtue of a heavy
artifact rain of later occupations and only light sedimentation, just the fluted point (and not the tools
and debitage that were part of the same assemblage
and are still present at the site) is recognized as
Clovis (while the occurrence ought to be tallied as
a site). Alternatively, that Clovis point might be no

more than a single isolate left at that locality by
earlier Clovis groups (and should be counted as an
isolate, and not as a site). Finally, the Clovis point
might have been picked up elsewhere by later
groups and brought into the site by them for their
use (its present context therefore providing few clues
as to whether its original context was as an isolate
or in a site).
These several possibilities, especially the first
two, are likely in areas where key resources, freshwater or stone, for instance, long attracted human
occupation, while the third would be likely (but not
necessarily restricted) to stone-poor areas. And unless the Clovis point was re-fashioned into a later
style (notched, say), its post-Clovis life history
might not be easily traced. Examples of Clovis
points apparently recycled by later groups would
include the fluted points at Ryanâs site (Hartwell et
al. 1989), Crockett Gardens (Hays 1982), the
Doering site (Wheat 1953), 41SP69 (Chandler
1982), the Fred Yarbrough site (Johnson 1961), La
Perdida (Weir 1956), the Meier site (Meier and
Hester 1972, 1976), and the Obshner site (Crook
and Harris 1955).
Sorting these and other possibilities (the ones
listed are just the few that come readily to mind) is
mostly a methodological problem: how can we differentiate Clovis versus later debitage, for example?
Resolving that problem will also require detailed
information on the archeological, geological, hydrological, and paleoenvironmental context of the
occurrence, information that unfortunately rarely
accompanies the points in the TCFPS. Thus, while
"surface scatter" is presently the most common context in which Clovis points occur, we cannot conclude that they represent scattered Clovis
components or, for that matter, Clovis isolates.
A related matter bears mention: as seems evident elsewhere in Clovis times, and particularly in
comparison to later, post-Paleoindian occupations,
Clovis groups did not always participate in the
highly structured spatial behavior that produces
sites. As highly mobile hunter-gatherers, whose
movements were virtually unrestricted across the
very thinly inhabited and relatively rich Late Pleistocene landscape, Clovis groups were not forced to
use the same localities repeatedly, and hence would

not necessarily build up a visible archeological
record at any one. Indeed, most of the known Texas
Clovis sites represent single, very short-term events
(the Aubrey site [Ferring 1989, 1990, 1995b] being
a particularly well-documented example).
The exception to this pattern would be those
areas in which key resources were relatively rare
and spatially restricted (so-called point resources):
like the freshwater springs and ponds on the High
Plains. Such point resources would lend themselves
to repeated and perhaps cyclical Clovis exploitation
and use, which in turn would lead to the build-up of
spatially concentrated debris (sites). Given that many
of the springs and ponds on the High Plains dried in
the Early Holocene (Holliday 1989, 1995), these
localities would not necessarily be targets of later
groups, and hence would not become palimpsests of
different occupations (surface scatters).
Conversely, where the point resources were
unaffected by changing climates or environments
(high-quality stone outcrops, for example), use by
Clovis and later groups would ultimately result in
large surface scatters. Again, however, unless there
was active sedimentation on site, discrete Clovis
components may not be separable. The intensive
use of the Edwards chert outcrops along the
Balcones Escarpment provides a good illustration
of this. It is appropriate to add that the resultant
concentration of Clovis material need not arise, as
Shiner (1983) suggested, from sedentary Clovis occupations, but simply from the build-up of assemblages over repeated visits (Meltzer 1987:44).
To a degree, these inferences are supported by
the analysis in Table 7, which provides the chisquare and adjusted residuals3 values for the locality
data in Table 6 (which of course excludes tallies on
the Clovis points for which the context was
"unknown"). The significant chi-square result
indicates that site context and region are not
independent: there are regions in which points occur
in certain contexts more often than would be
expected by chance. The adjusted residuals help
pinpoint which of the cells (region by context)
contributed most to the chi square.
In Central Texas, as inferred, surface scatters
occur significantly more often than would be expected by chance, while isolates are significantly

3 Adjusted residuals help identify which cells are responsible for a significant chi-square value (Everitt 1977:46-47). Adjusted
residuals are read as standard normal deviates; values greater than 1.96 (or -1.96) mark cells in which the observed values are
significant--hence, have observed values greater (or lesser) than would expected (and thus drive the chi-square value).

under-represented (adjusted residuals values of 2.33
and -3.08, respectively). A similar pattern seems to
characterize the Coast region. For lack of other
information, McFaddin Beach is currently designated as a surface scatter, given that it has also
yielded other Paleoindian points, as well as those of
Archaic and Late Prehistoric age (Turner and Tanner 1994:324). Were the McFaddin Beach materials
derived from one or more discrete site contexts, the
results would almost certainly change. In the Plains/
Panhandle and in North Central Texas, the pattern is
just the reverse: Clovis points found as isolates are
more common, surface scatters less so.
These results open a window into Clovis settlement strategies, suggesting as they do that such
strategies differ across the state. Perhaps, following
the earlier line of argument, resource exploitation
in Central Texas entailed the kind of highly structured spatial behavior that produces sites: camping
at springs and refurbishing tool kits from locally
abundant supplies of chert, for example. We might
speculate, therefore, that Clovis points occurring
within surface scatters at localities with such key,
point resources might represent palimpsests of sites,
more so than a record of isolates (after all, if the
locality attracted repeated use throughout prehistory, then it may equally have attracted repeated
occupations by Clovis groups).
In contrast, in North Central Texas and on the
Plains/Panhandle it would appear more non-point
resources were utilized. On the Plains, point resources that were visited repeatedly, such as the
freshwater springs and lakes around which many of

the isolates were found, were not otherwise used in
ways that produced a significant archeological
record~ Such speculations, however, are limited by
the lack of more fine-grained data in the TCFPS on
the precise contexts of Clovis points.

VARIATION AND PATTERN IN TEXAS
CLOVIS FLUTED POINTS
There is additional information to be gleaned
from the points themselves which sheds light on
this and other aspects of Clovis adaptations. To
explore these issues, we sought through the TCFPS
data on the kinds of lithic raw material used in the
manufacture of the points (which may reveal something of Clovis settlement strategies), patterns in
fluted point size and shape (which might bear on
technology, function, and possibly style), and information on fluted point life-histories.

Raw material sources and usage
The analysis of lithic raw materials used in the
production of Texas fluted points was limited by
the fact that correspondents were generally able to
identify the stone to type (chert as opposed to quartzite, say), but less often to specific outcrops or even
sources; this is a difficulty hardly limited to TCFPS
correspondents, given the well-known complexity
of raw material sourcing (Banks 1990:6-7; Hofman
et al. 1991). Even so, enough raw material types
were identified to make some statements about the

64

Texas Archeological Society

sources of raw material used by Clovis groups in
the manufacture of their points or, short of that, at
least the general rock type used (Table 8).
Not surprisingly, the majority of the 137 Clovis
points across the state identifiable to raw material
type were manufactured of Edwards Formation
(Cretaceous) cherts, which crop out over a large
area of Centra! Texas (Banks 1990:Figure 3.1;
Frederick and Ringstaff 1994:Figures 6.3-6.5).
Based on those data, and the descriptions that accompany many of the reports, we would speculate
that a majority of the 269 "unknowns" in Table 8
are also made of Edwards chert. In those instances
where uncertainty existed, however, we tallied the
stone type as unknown.
Far fewer Clovis points statewide are manufactured of Alibates agatized dolomite and Tecovas
jasper, which crop out in relatively smaller areas of
the Plains/Panhandle and escarpment (Banks
1990:91-92). Less common still are points made of
quartzite (those that were fashioned of Morrison or
Dakota quartzite, which crops out discontinuously
across the High Plains [Banks 1990:90]). Individual Clovis specimens were also fashioned of petrified wood (source locality unknown), Manning fused
glass (Brown 1976,1994; this material outcrops in
eastern Texas [Banks 1990:53]), and obsidian.

An interesting pattern emerges in the data on
Edwards, Alibates, and Tecovas materials that comprise the bulk of the identified sources. If one collapses the data in Table 8 to show only the number
of Clovis points fashioned of Edwards chert by
region, arrayed against the number of Clovis points
fashioned of either Alibates or Tecovas by region
(combining the Alibates and Tecovas stone sources
on the rationale that together they represent a "High
Plains" source), as in Table 9, it becomes clear
there is a distinct asymmetry in Clovis stone usage.
Clovis points fashioned of Edwards chert were
commonly found in Central Texas as well as on the
High Plains (although as the adjusted residuals indicate, Edwards is still significantly under-represented on the High Plains). Yet, Clovis points made
from the High Plains sources were common on the
High Plains, but rarely were carried east into Central Texas (and given the cautions of Goode [cited
in Banks 1990:61], there is a possibility the few
that do occur in that region are not actually Alibates
or Tecovas, but an anomalous local Edwards variety). The easternmost occurrence of a point manufactured of Alibates "flint" is from the McFaddin
Beach locality (Long 1977:7), but as noted previously, it exhibits little of the attrition that often
occurs on points so far from their source, and thus

seems oddly out of place on the Texas Gulf coast
(Meltzer 1987:45). Points made from Alibates and
Tecovas, however, were often carried onto the
High Plains far to the north and west of their
source, as seen most notably in their occurrence in
the Drake Cache in North Central Colorado, some
485 km from the Alibates outcrops (Stanford and
Jodry 1988).
What this pattern of stone use might indicate
is that the Clovis High Plains settlement system
tracked predominantly to the north and west of that
region (and then back), more so than to the south
and east, although, of course, High Plains groups
did utilize Edwards chert (Meltzer 1989b). Unless
the Edwards chert on the High Plains marks Clovis
groups from Central Texas moving onto the High
Plains, it suggests as well that they cycled back to
Central Texas without procuring or using to any
significant degree the stone local to the High Plains.
Such speculations, however, must be taken with the
caveat that the raw material evidence is saying no
more than that certain stone sources were being
used, and is not directly tracking whether Clovis
settlement systems did not extend in certain directions or in specific regions. Still, it does highlight
the fact that in order to truly understand the movements of hunter-gatherers as wide-ranging as these
Clovis groups clearly were, one must attack the
problem on a very large scale, and (reinforcing the
point made at the outset) pay no attention to modern political boundaries.

Perhaps shedding additional light on Clovis
settlement systems is an intriguing bit of largely
negative evidence, which naturally must be taken
with great caution. No artifact-quality obsidian occurs in Texas (Hester 1988); hence, any obsidian in
or near the state is exotic and was imported. For
reasons outlined in Meltzer (1989b), it is suspected
that where exotic stone comprises the bulk of a
groupâs stone supply, then it most likely was obtained by the group directly at the distant outcrop.
Cases where exotic stone is extremely rare open the
possibility that either direct procurement or exchange might have been the mechanism by which
the stone was moved from source to site. In general, most lithic raw material used in Clovis sites
(and perhaps Folsom as well [Hofman 1992:198]),
appears to have been directly procured. But obsidian-rare as it is and distant as its sources--may
prove the exception to that rule.
One obsidian Clovis point occurs on the High
Plains at Blackwater Locality No. 1 (the Clovis
type site) in New Mexico, just across the Texas
border. It was made of obsidian from the Valles
Caldera in the central Rio Grande Valley of New
Mexico, some 350 km west of the site (Johnson et
al. 1985:52). No other obsidian Clovis points from
this or any other central Rio Grande source have
been found on the High Plains. This indicates that
in Clovis times at least there was only infrequent
traffic between the two regions, which may reveal
something of the direction of Clovis settlement

66

systems, backhanded support for the supposition
that Plains Clovis groups were moving south to
north, or perhaps some evidence of the scale of
these systems.
In regard to the latter, one might observe that
obsidian Clovis points tend to be infrequent in North
America, occurring most often and in the greatest
abundance in what we might term "Clovis-proximity" to major obsidian sources (e.g., the Dietz site
in Oregon [Willig t988]). "Clovis proximity" is
about 300 km, the figure that turns up repeatedly in
measures of the distances these groups are known
to have traveled from their stone sources (Haynes
1982:392; Meltzer 1993a:305). It may well be that
if groups cycling through the central Rio Grande
were heading towards the Plains, they did not do so
often or extend very far onto the Plains (it being
beyond Clovis proximity), or interact with groups
that were on the Plains. It would be most interesting, although well beyond the scope of the present
paper, to determine the relative frequency of Clovis
points made of Alibates or Tecovas in the central
Rio Grande Valley, in order to see the degree to
which the pattern evident in the use of obsidian in
Texas was mirrored in the other direction by the
use of Texas cherts Judge (1973:248) notes that 21
percent of a sample of 26 Clovis points from the
central Rio Grande are made of "chert and obsidian," but does not specify the chert in question.
Judge adds that 43 percent of the points are made
of chalcedony, which appears at the Aubrey site
(Ferring, personal communication, 1995) as well; it
was not distinguished in the TCFPS analysis, but
does occur in this sample.
Only two obsidian Clovis points have been
found within Texas. One was reported by Hester
(1988) from the Port Lavaca area of Calhoun County
on the central Gulf Coast (41CL72), and had been
heavily abraded by wave action. The precise source
of the obsidian could not be determined by laboratory analysis: however, it did not match the known
New Mexico sources, nor did it match sources
known from old Mexico (each at least 1000 km to
the west and south, respectively) (Hester t988:28).
In this instance, knowing the context of the discovery is crucial (notably, whether the point was picked
up and moved by post-Clovis groups), for if that
context is securely Clovis and its source can be
located it may be possible to infer something of the
scale and direction of Clovis movements across the
landscape or Clovis exchange.

In that regard, the obsidian Clovis point from
Kincaid Shelter is of some interest. This point, originally described by Hester et al. (1985:t50-151) as
an indeterminate (possibly Angostura-like) Paleoindian point, has subsequently been identified by
Collins et al. (1989) on the basis of the pointâs
morphology and context as Clovis. The point was
fashioned of obsidian derived from a Valley of
Mexico source (Queretaro) some 1000 km south of
Kincaid. It is a heavily ground basal fragment, which
Collins (personal communication, 1995), believes
represents a re-tooling discard. Point manufacture
was taking place at Kincaid, and not surprisingly
the Clovis preforms from the site are made of locally available chert; the obsidian point was one of
the very few exotics in the Kincaid Clovis assemblage. If this obsidian specimen was acquired directly at the source by highly mobile Clovis groups,
as opposed to obtained via exchange, its presence
in Central Texas would imply a considerable settlement range. Taking this evidence a step further, if
Clovis groups were the first Americans and were
generally trending southward through the hemisphere (in addition to their more "local" settlement
moves), then this evidence would also indicate that
the migratory process was not unidirectional, and
that even after travelling some distance south of the
Rio Grande, these groups cycled back north as well.
This is in keeping with recent models of the peopling of the Americas, which anticipate "reverse
migrations" in the long process of colonizing the
continent (Meltzer 1995), but again it assumes that
Clovis groups were the first Americans--which may
or may not be the case.

Texas Clovis Morphometrics

Of the 201 points added to the data set since
1986, morphological and metric data are available
on 132 of them (Table 10). Measurements on all
variables were not always available for all
specimens, however; hence, the different values for
n in Table 10. Adding those data to the analysis is
revealing in several ways, not the least of which is
that despite substantially increasing the number of
points from the original sample, the overall size
and shape patterns remain largely unchanged
(compare Table 10 with Meltzer 1987:Table 9).
That there was so little change between the two
samples demonstrates that the original data set was
indeed a reasonably representative one in terms of

Meltzer and Bever ~ Paleoindians of Texas
point morphology. Were the original sample not
representative, the additional data would have
significantly changed the statistical patterning.
The data from the TCFPS indicate that the
"average" Texas Clovis fluted point is just over 6
cm long, and 2.75 cm wide at its widest spot (generally, the base is narrower, only 2.36 cm wide). The
widest spot occurs partly up the blade, 2.88 cm up
from the base, just a few mm beyond where the haft
ended. The haft area in Clovis points is marked by
edge grinding, which on average extends upwards
from the base 2.59 cm, and is present on virtually all
of the points in the TCFPS. The maximum thickness
of these points averages 7.3 mm, and generally the
points are thickest on the blade portion well beyond
the haft (3.5 cm from the base) and beyond the point
of maximum width. In effect, these points are "front
heavy." All of which means they have a slight taper,
in both plan and longitudinal section. Flute scars
generally do not extend beyond the haft area, are
centered over the point axis, and are sufficiently
narrow (on average, 1.29 cm wide) that they rarely
extend to the lateral edges of the point.
Further, the points in this sample tend to scale
by size in a relatively straightforward manner:
longer points are generally thicker and wider (at
both their maximum and at their base), and the
spots in which they are widest and thickest are
farther from the base (correlations of length with
maximum width to base and maximum thickness to
base are rp = .7090 and .8681, respectively, with
both significant at the .000 level). Longer points
also tend to have longer flute scars although their
length does not correlate as strongly with overall
length (rp = .3562, p = .000). As might be expected, the extent of the edge grinding does not
correlate with length (rp = .0878, p = .149); the
size of the haft was apparently relatively constant
regardless of point size (see below, as well). To
highlight the obvious: the length of edge grinding
can also be more tightly controlled than flute scar
length, which is also part of the haft. The number
of flute scars does not correlate at all with point
length (r~= -.0432, significance = .475, and -.0754,
significance = .215, for flute scars on the obverse
and reverse faces, respectively).
At least those are the statistical averages and
trends. Of course, it is highly unlikely that all (or
even most) of the 406 points in the TCFPS conform
precisely to the averages in Table 10. But these
statistics do show that in certain attributes there is

67

considerable conformance to the mean, while in
others there is more variance about the mean (as
measured by, for example, kurtosis, which indicates the shape of the distribution of cases about a
mean: normal distributions have a kurtosis value of
zero, positive kurtosis values result where most of
the individual cases cluster tightly around the average value for all cases, while negative values occur
where cases are scattered widely around the mean).
While we obviously cannot describe each point individually, we can use such measures to help gain
insight into how and in what attributes the "average" values are representative (or not), and from
that perhaps draw some general inferences about
Texas Clovis fluted point morphology, technology,
and function.
As was true in the original survey, a measure
that shows considerable variation is the maximum
length of the fluted point, which in the original
sample had a kurtosis value of -.28; the value is
currently .05, indicating a very slight "tightening"
of the distribution about the mean in this larger
sample. The relative scatter of length values is easily understandable: length varied considerably over
the life history of a Clovis fluted point as a result of
use, breakage, and reworking (Meltzer 1987:56).
Because the data in Table 10 come from all the
cases in the TCFPS, including whole, reworked,
and broken points, the values naturally vary. Accordingly, the subsample of only the whole and
completely unbroken points in the TCFPS is longer
and much less varied (mean = 7.81 cm; kurtosis =
.81), than the subsample of only the reworked points
(mean = 5.38 cm; kurtosis = .50). In fact, there is a
statistically significant difference in the lengths of
whole versus reworked points (t-value = 6.49, significant at .000 level) (see also Meltzer 1987:49).
In general, it appears points were reworked
while still mounted in their haft (Meltzer 1987:49),
based on the "shouldering" just beyond the haft
that occurs in many cases, and the fact that flute
scars and edge grinding were rarely removed by
subsequent flaking or retouch. Thus, reworking
mostly affected the blade portion of the fluted point,
and because reworking did not just make the points
shorter, but narrower too (by moving the blade
edges in), the maximum width to base measure is
significantly reduced in reworked points as well
(the mean for whole points is 3.33 cm, for reworked
points it is 2.26 cm, producing a t-value of 4.97,
significance = .000).

Flute thickness

~There were several discrepancies in the original published version of this table (Meltzer 1987:Table 9)--the most glaring of
which was maximum fluted point thickness erroneously listed as 2.80 cm, far thicker than any fluted point in this or perhaps any
other sample. We present the corrected data here. Certain measurements were not taken in the original survey, hence the
difference in the variable list between the 1986 and current samples.
-~ These values are derived by first calculating the average flute length on an individual fluted point (by summing flute length on
the obverse and reverse faces of the point, then dividing by two), then averaging those values for all points.
3 The calculation for average flute width was done in the same manner as the calculation for average flute length.
4 The calculation for average length of edge grinding was done in a similar manner as average flute length and width, only in this
instance the length of the left and right edge grinding was averaged for each individual point.

Meltzer and Beret ~ Paleoindians of Texas
If reworking also made the blade thinner, then
there should be a difference in maximum thickness
to base between whole and reworked points. However, if reworking was of the sort that characterized Dalton points, in which the blade was
narrowed and its edges steepened, but the blade
was not thinned. In that case, there would be no
significant difference between whole and reworked
points. Unfortunately, we have measurements of
maximum thickness to base on only nine of the
whole and reworked points in the TCFPS, so a test
of that proposition would not be statistically meaningful at present.
But perhaps we can explore this issue another
way: by looking at the values for maximum thickness. These were normally distributed about the
mean, and showed approximately the same dispersion as maximum length values (see Table 10).
That variability might result from reworking and/or
use, or perhaps other factors. In a recent discussion,
Tankersley (1994) argued that variation in fluted
point thickness results from variation in the lithic
raw material selected for use, and as a byproduct of
the use of a percussion-based bifacial reduction
strategy. He assumed that percussion flaking yields
less precise and more variable thinning flakes than
that resulting from the controlled pressure-flake fluting of Folsom times (Tankersley 1994:506). Unfortunately, Tankersleyâs paper proposes, but by no
means demonstrates, that the relationship between
thickness and raw material/technology occurs, and
the proposition is weakened on several counts, not
least that the site (Williamson) in Tankersleyâs
sample with the most raw material variability is not
the one with the greatest variation in point thickness (see Tankersley 1994:Tables 2 and 10). Still,
the proposition makes intuitive sense, so it is appropriate to ask, is there such variation in the thickness of fluted points in the TCFPS sample, and can
that variation be correlated with raw material types?
A histogram of the distribution of fluted point
maximum thickness reveals a bimodality in the
TCFPS sample: one mode centers around 0.63 cm,
the other around 0.81 cm. Obviously, if Tankersleyâs
supposition is correct, then that bimodality ought to
represent two distinct lithic raw material subgroups
within the sample. Our data do not support this,
however. These two modes do not correspond with
raw material types. Instead, the maximum thickness
of points made of Edwards chert and Alibates
agatized dolomite is quite similar (average thickness

69

for Edwards points [n=86] is 0.742 cm; average
thickness for Alibates points [n=22] is 0.756 cm),
and statistically indistinguishable (t-value = -.35,
significance ; .727). While Tankersleyâs proposition
is not supported by this particular data set, there is
always the possibility that raw material differences
might emerge in the use of other, more contrasting
lithic raw materials than Edwards and Alibates: it
would be useful, therefore, to compare points made
of, say, Edwards, and those made of Dakota
quartzite, but unfortunately, sample sizes of
quartzite and other non-chert materials in the TCFPS
are currently too small to make statistically
meaningful comparisons. Thus, it remains to be
demonstrated that fluted point thickness varies with
raw material type (see also the comments in Amick
1995:34).
As to what does explain the observed variation
and bimodality in fluted point thickness, we explored whether it might sort by region, reworking,
and many other possibilities, ultimately concluding
that point thickness appears to sort by breakage
types. Specifically, whole points tend to be significantly thicker than points that have snapped in half:
the average thickness for whole points (n=135) is
0.752 cm; the average thickness for laterally snapped
point bases (n=42) is 0.654 cm; the two means are
significantly different (t-value = 3.72, significance
= .000). That, of course, brings us back to the observation earlier made that the spot of maximum
thickness generally occurs on the blade beyond the
haft. Since lateral snaps usually occur along the
upper edge of the haft (also Meltzer 1987:49), that
effectively removes the thickest portions of the
point, and thus gives us the observed bimodality. In
effect, then, it does not appear there is any significant variation in fluted point thickness, at least none
that is not explained by the overall size of the points
in the TCFPS sample.
The fact that reworking was generally done
outside the haft helps explain the relatively higher
kurtosis values for variables within the haft area,
such as flute thickness and basal width, as well as
why the averages for the latter changed less than
0.2 mm between the 1986 and current samples. It is
worth noting, as well, that the average value of
basal width in the TCFPS sample is within 0.2 and
0.6 mm of the averages for 305 Clovis points from
the Midwest, and 57 Clovis points from Oklahoma
(see Hofman and Wyckoff 199!:30; Tankersley
1994:Table 3).

In turn, these relatively high kurtosis values
suggest that since the attributes most directly associated with the haft vary the least, there was a
degree of "standardization" in point manufacture.
Were these artifacts all intended for use as spear
points, one might suggest the standardization reflects the critical size range necessary for maximum penetrating efficiency (e.g., Sollberger 1988:2,
11). However, that argument may not hold, as many
of these points (by their wear and retouch patterns,
lack of impact fractures, and distinctive breakage)
were almost certainly also used as halted knives
(see Meltzer 1987:46-54).
Alternatively, the standardization may reflect
hafting demands, and those required of maintaining
composite (tool, haft, and foreshaft) artifacts (for a
further discussion along these lines, see Bleed
[1986]). Judge (1973), and others (e.g., Amick 1995;
Keeley 1982; Meltzer 1987:56; Odell 1994:54-55;
Shott 1986:43) have inferred that hafted tools were
made to fit their hafts, and not vice versa, and that
the hafts themselves were maintained and curated
through the lifetimes of several points (hence, the
standardization in attributes such as basal width).
Perhaps this implies that the raw materials for hafting (bone, wood, or ivory) were scarcer or by some
other measure (perhaps the labor involved in manufacture or the scarcity of suitable materials) more
"costly" than the stone to make the points. Or perhaps it indicates that stone points simply had a much
shorter use life than the non-stone hafts. In any case,
making a new point was likely more efficient and
less costly than making a new haft, and thus the
point became the most readily expendable and interchangeable part in this artifact system.
This conclusion may seem somewhat counterintuitive, given the time involved in point production, and especially the potential for failure in the
very last stages of point manufacture--the fluting
itself (Bradley 1993; Sollberger 1988:13). Still,
Clovis fluting may have been less prone to failure
than fluting the thinner Folsom points (Bradley
1993:255), although it nonetheless always involved
a degree of risk of errant flutes ending in reverse
hinge or step fractures that broke the preforms
(Sollberger 1988:9). But stone was, relatively speaking, a reasonably inexpensive commodity, and perhaps the risks of fluting were less than they appear
some 11,000 years after the fact.
The specific technological process by which
Clovis fluting was accomplished--whether direct

or indirect percussion, pressure, or levered pressure-is still a matter of discussion and debate (e.g.,
Bradley 1993; Collins 1990, unpublished;
Henderson and Goode 1991; Mallouf 1989;
Sollberger 1988). There is little in the TCFPS data
that will resolve that issue, since it is difficult to
tease technological information from morphological data on a group of finished and primarily isolated fluted points. The TCFPS data do, however,
shed some light on the fluting process, at least on a
statewide scale.
For one, it was a remarkably exact process.
The tight distribution of flute thickness is evidence
of that, indicating as it does that there was a narrow
range of thickness tolerances, perhaps driven by
the requirements of the haft. The fluting process
most often involved a single flute on each face, and
only occasionally multiple flutes (flutes side by
side and sometimes overlapping); roughly 30 percent of the 285 points for which data are available
have two or more flutes. Multiple flutes were in
some cases struck to provide guide ridges for a
main flute.
Basal preparation in advance of fluting is not
always obvious in the finished products, especially
when the base was retouched afterwards. However,
it is of interest to observe that the basal concavity
in these points is on average rather shallow (less
than 3 mm), much smaller than the average for
Clovis points in other parts of North America, notably in the northeast U.S. and on the northern Plains
(e.g., Colby points), and considerably smaller than
the average in some forms that have basal concavities upwards of 8 mm deep (Gramly 1982:Table 2;
Tankersley 1994:Table 3). The depth of the basal
concavity may be a stylistic feature and!or a technological one, and in the case of the latter may
represent one (or more) of several possibilities: a
by-product of pre-flute platform preparation
(whether bevelling or preparation of nipple platforms) and platform remodeling (e.g., Sollberger
1988:12); the result of fluting; or a consequence of
post-fluting trimming and retouch (possibly by pressure flaking) (Collins 1990:74). One fact seems
clear: the depth of the basal concavity is unrelated
to flute length (rp = -.1306, p = .145),flute width
(rp = -.0266, p = .763), and the number of flutes, so
does not appear to be a direct correlate of the fluting process itself.
Flute length, as noted, seems to scale with
overall point length, but only weakly, which

Meltzer and Bever u Paleoindians of Texas
suggests that beyond a certain minimum length the
extent of the flute did not particularly matter. In
fact, while the overall range of flute length extends
up to a maximum of 5.2 cm, that maximum value is
an anomaly, much longer than the next longest
flute scar (4.5 cm). Plotting the distribution of
average flute lengths reveals that in the large
majority (77 percent) of the cases, flute length falls
between 1.5 and 3 cm. There was clearly little effort,
at least in this sample of Clovis points, to create
flutes that ran much past the haft, let alone the full
length of the point, as they do in Folsom points,
and in some eastern fluted styles (e.g., Barnes,
Cumberland). As an aside, the empirical observation
that longer flutes occur on later point styles
(Sollberger 1988:11) seems correct on a continental
scale, but that does not mean the reverse is true:
that is, shorter flutes are not necessarily earlier. In
fact, some of the later eastern varieties, like
Holcombe, have short flutes (for a useful discussion
of stylistic change in eastern and some western
fluted points, see Deller and Ellis [1992:125-133]).
Nor is it yet clear that full-length fluting can be
used as a chronological marker independent of
radiocarbon dating, or that flute length increased
over time as a result of technological improvements
which yielded greater hunting efficiency (Sollberger
1988:3, 7).
There is in the TCFPS sample evidence for a
regional difference in flute length: points from
Central Texas tend to have longer flutes than those
on the High Plains (the means are 2.68 and 2.28
cm respectively, producing a t-value of 2.61, significance =.01). But as points on the High Plains
also show a higher incidence of reworking (see
below), often obscuring the distal portion of the
flute scars (a practice that, in general, was avoided
by Clovis knappers [Bradley 1993:254]), these differences influte length are likely not technological
or stylistic. In fact, when only whole points are
considered,flute length does not differ between the
two areas.

Clovis Life-histories

As is evident, Clovis fluted points in the TCFPS
vary considerably in their condition. The numbers
of whole and broken points are tallied in Table 11.
The tally is obviously biased toward whole points
and points in which at least a portion of the base
remains. The reason for that is twofold: first, whole

71

points are more likely to be collected and reported;
and, second, only points in which the flute is visible are likely to be recognized as C!ovis. There are
in the TCFPS sample some 55 fluted point bases
(categories 2 and 5), most of which snapped off at
the haft line. Just as many distal ends were once
attached to those bases, and at least some of them
ought to be present in the archeological record, but
if they lack any evidence of a flute their Clovis
affinities might not be obvious (and as flutes tend
not to extend much beyond the haft, they were
likely absent on many of those distal ends).
The frequency of whole points is actually
higher than it appears in Table 11, for several of the
other categories (4, 6 and 7) are points that are
virtually intact, and have only minor breaks that
likely took place after the points had been discarded or lost (it is common for points lying on a
surface, for example, to lose a tip or corner). In
fact, 169 of the points in Table 11 (the sum of
categories 1, 4, 6, and 7) can be counted having
been discarded or lost while still essentially intact.
While that is a large number for the size of the
sample, it is not unexpected, given the manner in
which points are recognized and collected.
Of the remainder of the points in Table 11,
breakage likely took place while the points were in
use; perhaps this was the reason the points were
discarded. As before (cf. Meltzer 1987:Table 6),
lateral snaps are the most common break in the
TCFPS sample (categories 2 and 5, n = 55). For a
variety of reasons (Meltzer 1987:48-49), lateral
snaps may indicate points broken while being
levered in the haft. That action hints at the additional
use of these points as knives, a suggestion
corroborated in some instances by patterns of
retouch and utilization.
Reworking (categories 3 and 10) is evident on
58 of the points, and is responsible for some of the
morphometric patterns seen in the sample (as just
noted). Furthermore, reworked points are not distributed evenly among the regions; rather, the incidence of reworking is significantly higher than
would be expected in the Plains~anhandle region
(Table 12). Lithic raw material was, of course, relatively scarce there (above, see also Johnson and
Holliday 1984:67; Meltzer 1987:43), which led
Paleoindians (and, for that matter, later groups) to
conserve their raw material through judicious reworking and reuse of points and tools (see also
Amick 1995; Hofman 1992).

Overall, reworked points tend to be the same
length regardless of region and regardless of raw
material type, which indicates that there may have
been a threshold size beyond which a point was no
longer useful in that form, and reworking ceased.
There is a further, interesting pattern bearing on
reworking hinted at when these data are partitioned
by the major raw. material types: whole and reworked points made of Edwards chert tend be
slightly longer (by 0.27 cm) in Central Texas (their
source areas) than on the High Plains (where they
had to be imported). The difference is not statistically significant. And yet whole and reworked points
of Alibates and Tecovas also tend to be slightly
longer (this time, by 1.32 cm) in Central Texas and
not the Plains, where the raw material occurs. Again,
the difference is not statistically significant, and the
sample sizes make any conclusions premature (there
are 16 points for which data are available). Still,

these data raise the possibility that reworking of
Alibates and Tecovas was more extensive on the
High Plains where the distance (in time and space)
to stone sources enhanced efforts to prolong point
use-life through resharpening and reworking; reworking was less extensive in Central Texas where
there was an ample supply of raw material to replace the points long before they reached the threshold beyond which they were unusable or exhausted.
Impact fractures (n -- 6) remain extremely rare
in Texas Clovis fluted points, and occur mostly (5/
6) on points from the Plains~anhandle. Whether
that regional difference bespeaks different uses of
the points is uncertain, especially given the small
sample size, and the fact that reworking may have
masked impact fractures that were once on other
points. Reworked points, as noted earlier, are shorter
and narrower than whole points, but whether some
of those represent impact damaged-projectiles that

were repaired, as opposed to points that were simply
resharpened, is unknown. Taking this low figure at
face value, however, does highlight (he contrast
between Clovis and later Paleoindian assemblages,
especially those from Plains bison kills, in which
impact features are common damage on points used
to bring down large game. The low incidence of
impact fractures in this large sample of Clovis
points, including the one from the Murphey site
apparently associated with mastodon remains (Story
1990:185), raises the question of whether these
points were regularly used as the tips of spears
(also Meltzer 1987:50-51).
Preforms (broken and whole) are equally rare
in the TCFPS sample (n = 6), although this is partly
a definitional matter: only later stage preforms in
which the flute was present (and hence recognizable as Clovis) were recorded in the survey. Earlier
stage preforms and reduction debris are present at a
few sites in Texas, notably Aubrey (Ferring, personal communication, 1995), Kincaid Shelter
(Collins et al. 1989), Spring Lake (Takac 1991),
and Yellow Hawk (Mallouf 1989), and ultimately
it is this evidence that will yield the most precise
information on C!ovis technology.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The salient facts that emerge from this update
of the TCFPS are as follows: the sample (n = 406)

is now nearly double what it was originally, and in
most respects is a representative one. The sample is
not biased by modern population density, and its
statistical similarity to the original data set suggests
it provides a valid profile of Texas Clovis material
(with exceptions as noted).
In this updated sample, points were added to
33 counties where Clovis records had not previously been reported, raising the total number of
Texas counties with Clovis points to 128. The vast
majority of counties have less than two Clovis
points, though a few (Crosby, Gaines, and
Jefferson), have more than 10. The average density
of Clovis points by region is 15 per 10,000 square
miles, although some regions (such as the TransPecos) have far lower densities, while in other regions (the Coast) the densities are much greater.
These patterns are also reflected in finergrained statewide maps, which also show a considerable density of Clovis material on the High Plains
and on a crescent-shaped arc through Central Texas,
but lower densities in East Texas, and a near absence of Clovis material on the Lower Plains. In
some areas (such as the Trans-Pecos, Central Texas,
and the High Plains), those patterns may accurately
represent the relative intensity of Clovis land use.
In other areas, the patterns may be skewed by geological processes which either mask Clovis age surfaces and remains (the Lower Plains), or prevent us
from understanding the context from which Clovis
remains are derived (McFaddin Beach on the Coast).

One pattern does seem clear, which is that the
Clovis distribution is not coincident with the
distribution of later Paleoindian remains (including
Folsom), except at a very coarse spatial scale. This
contrast may imply differences in land use
strategies, and is in keeping with independent
evidence that the adaptations of Clovis groups may
be quite different than those of the Paleoindians
who followed.
A further expression of Clovis land use patterns
is in the context in which Clovis materials occur.
Most are found within surface scatters of material
of later age; the remainder occur as true isolates;
only a few occur in discrete Clovis sites. Such
patterns, which to a degree vary by region, bespeak
adaptations which did not always involve the
redundant use of space, except perhaps in those
instances where fixed, point resources occur, such
as freshwater springs on the Plains or chert in
Central Texas.
The majority of Texas Clovis fluted points are
made of Edwards Group chert from Central Texas;
a significant minority are fashioned of Alibates
agatized dolomite and Tecovas jasper from the High
Plains/Panhandle region; a few specimens are made
of Dakota quartzite; individual points occur on a
sprinkling of rare materials. There are regional differences in raw material use: Edwards cherts are
common throughout the state, while the High Plains
raw materials tend to drop off sharply in frequency
moving east off the Plains, though stone from these
same sources was routinely carried north on the
Plains. Such patterns, and the extreme scarcity of
material such as obsidian, reveal something of the
scale and direction of Clovis settlement mobility.
Texas Clovis fluted points are generally 6 cm
long, around 2.5 cm wide, are less than a cm thick,
taper in both plan and longitudinal section, were
fluted only once on each face, and generally were
fluted only within the haft area (as defined by the
extent of lateral grinding). As a group, however,
they also vary in their morphology and along certain
dimensions (notably length and thickness), but that
variation is attributable to reworking and breakage,
and not raw material differences or technological
strategies. In contrast, other dimensions of the points,
such as basal width and fluting thickness, are tightly
constrained, indicating considerable standardization
in the manufacture of these points. That standardization appears to be related to the demands of
fitting the points to pre-existing hafts.

Reworking of these points generally took
place while the points were still in the haft, and one
of the most common breakage patterns (lateral
snaps) also occurred while the points were in their
hafts. Reworking and breakage patterns varied by
region, with point attrition being especially pronounced on the Plains, where raw material was
scarcest and where, perhaps not coincidentally, the
few points with impact fractures were mostly recovered. Patterns in the use, reworking, and breakage of these points generally suggest they were
multifunctional: not simply projectile points, but
hafted knives as well.
In the end, much as there is to gain from this
enhanced sample of 406 fluted points, we can only
surmise that even more information will come as
additional records of Texas Clovis are compiled.
Certainly, more is still needed. We should continue
to seek more (and more precise) dataâ on Clovis
occurrences; greater information on the
paleoenvironmental stage which Clovis groups inhabited; data on raw material use and the context in
which these points are found; and information on
the technology, form, and function of these points.
We have little doubt that additional records
will be forthcoming, since we believe that the current tally remains just a sample (of size yet unknown) of the Clovis fluted points of Texas. More
will surely be recorded in collections yet undocumented, sites still uninvestigated, and regions now
but lightly examined. As these new data emerge,
they warrant careful investigation and documentation, for they continue to provide important insights into the adaptive strategies of the first
hunter-gatherers of Texas.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
As before, the TCFPS could not have been
accomplished without the help of the many people
who provided information on their Clovis points,
reported on points in other collections, allowed access to the Clovis points in their charge, or otherwise insured the success of the survey. The previous
paper (Meltzer 1987:61-62) acknowledged those
who provided data for the first round of the TCFPS.
