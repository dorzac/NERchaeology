COMMENTS CONCERNING SOME TYPE
NAMES IN nAN INTRODUCTORY
HANDBOOK OF TEXAS
ARCHEOLOGY"
CYRUS

N. RAY

This cloth-bound volume of 582 pages and 134 plates is
well edited, well printed and proof-read, and the pictures
are well done. This is the largest and evidently the most
expensive volume so far issued by the Texas Archeological
Society.
The introduction by Alex Krieger is excellent, the reasoning logical, and the quality of his writing is far above
that of the usual professional archeologists, who frequently
lack clarity and sometimes forthrightness of expression. We
consider the introduction to be the best-written part of the
book.
The most unfortunate feature of the book is that so many
of the classifications adopt Kelley's re-namings of the work
of others who had spent many years in making the basic
discoveries. Thus, many of the Handbook plates and type
descriptions show an absence of citations directing attention
to the fact that they show dart-point types under new names.
This will be quite confusing to careful researchers who have
read the original literature.
The writer will only discuss the stone artifact section of
the Handbook, especially the types of ancient man. Our
knowledge of pottery is not sufficient for comments on that
section. Apparently the person quoted most often as the
namer of ancient dart points, previously well known under
the names given them 15 or 20 years earlier, is one J. Charles
Kelley. Evidently this gentleman must have decided that
the names given these dart points by those who discovered
them, and who did the original research and publication on
them, lacked euphony or something and needed his lastminute attentions; but he should not have forgotten to mention their well-known, prior designations.

Comments Concerning Type Names

273

On Plate 80, under the name of Angostura points, we see
darts of a type first found near Abilene in ancient Clear
Fork Silts, and described and illustrated in the Bulletin of
the Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society (1929;
1934, Plate 18, Nos. 93, 94, 95). Why the compilers of the
Handbook went to South Dakota for a name for these points,
first pictured in the literature as a very ancient Texas type,
we know not.
On Plate 81 of the Handbook we have Bulverde points,
and of the 25 examples shown as the same type, there seem
to be 11 different kinds.
On Plate 86 we have Darl points, and there seem to be
some different types included here also, but most of the
darts shown are of the earliest phase of the Valley Creek
Culture, which were used just before small arrow heads
superceded dart heads. They usually are found with undecorated potsherds of two types, both tempered with fossil
bone. In the late phase of Valley Creek Culture, we have
incised potsherds, and arrow heads of the pine tree and
side-notched triangular forms supercede the dart heads. The
four-edged beveled knife occurs in both the early and the
late phase. All these features are markers of Valley Creek
Culture.
The Handbook lists the Valley Creek Culture arrow heads
on Plates 129 and 131 as Harrell and Perdiz points, with no
reference to previous terminology or descriptions. The components of the Valley Creek Culture were first shown in
the 1935 Bulletin of this Society as being found at Pottery
Site 17. Later, E. B. Sayles and the writer agreed on the
name Valley Creek Culture, with these beveled dart heads,
pine-tree arrow head, side-notched triangular arrow head,
and four-edged beveled knife as the markers for this culture.
Obsidian from New Mexico and Rio Grande potsherds from
Valley Creek Culture sites were identified as such by Dr.
H. P . Mera of the Laboratory of Anthropology in Santa Fe,
and the findings published in the 1935 Bulletin. The late

274

Texas Archeological Society

phase of Valley Creek Culture was the last flint culture in
Central Texas.
On Plate 108 of the Handbook are shown some so-called
"Nolan points", but why Nolan is a mystery, as they seldom
occur in Nolan County but are common in Taylor County
to the east of it. This type was described as Clear Fork Dart
2 in an article on the Clear Fork Culture Complex in the
1938 Bulletin, and 25 specimens were shown on Plate 25 of
that Bulletin. On page 458 of the Handbook, we read that
"Kelley, 1947a, p. 99 and Plate 10, D refers to this type as
'Nolan Beveled Stem' and considers it as the diagnostic trait
of his 'Clear Fork Focus' although it occurs throughout the
Edwards Plateau; he includes C. N. Ray's 'Clear Fork Dart
Points 1 and 2' within it."
To the writer as the one who named and first described
the Clear Fork Culture in the literature, the above reference
about reaches the limit. In my opinion, the term "Kelley's
'Clear Fork Focus' " was designed to imply that someone
other than the writer discovered and first described the
Clear Fork artifacts.
On Plates 113-115 of the Handbook there is another collection of dart heads whose only co.mmon point of similarity
is a bifurcated base, but from there on they are divergent.
Thomas Wilson, in the 1897 Annual Report of the United
States National Museum, Plate 38, shows ten bifurcated
points, two of them from Texas. Several others were shown
by the writer in an article published in Scientific American
in January, 1928. One form of the bifurcated point has been
well known for many years as the Pinto Point, named by
the Campbells of Twentynine Palms, California. The Campbells visited the writer several years ago and identified
some Pinto Points in his collections. The so-called Pedernales
points in the Handbook seem to include seven or more different types, unrelated in time. On Plate 113, we think that
at least six points (E, F , K, 0, R, S) are definitely Pinto
Points.

Comments Concerning Type Names

275

On Plate 113, too, the point shown as A is the most unrelated to all the others in type and greatly resembles what
the writer named and described as the Gibson Point in the
1940 Bulletin of this Society. It was found in place in the
Gibson site in Lower Clear Fork Silt, 25 feet below the
present surface, where it was witnessed by Dr. Otto 0. Watts
â¢
of Hardin-Simmons University and E. J. Gardiner of the
University of Texas. The same type of dart had previously
been found on the surface of ancient gravel at the McLean
site (1940 Bulletin, Plates 41, Nos. 2, 3, and 42, No. 15).
Dr. J. E. Pearce of the University of Texas illustrated
bifurcated points in his article on "The Present Status of
Texas Archeology" in the 1932 volume of this Bulletin (p. 44
and Plate 10). He illustrated the later and larger forms
which he found in the middle section of his "Old BurntRock Mounds".
Perhaps we should begin to use the scientific methods of
priority in discovery and printed description as a basis for
terminology, instead of changing the names of artifacts
every time a new crop of students arrives on the scene.
Wilson's term "bifurcate" has age and distinction back of
it, and could be used as the general term for the points on
Plates 113-115. Then, if anyone can give data on the location
and age of any special variety, let him name it unless someone else has already done the work.
Plate 120 shows 25 triangular dart points of the Clear
Fork Dart 3 and 4 types, which were first fully described
in an article by the writer entitled "The Clear Fork Culture
Complex" in the 1938 Bulletin of this Society. On Plate
25 of this article, 28 of these darts are illustrated. In the
Handbook, they are listed as Tortugas points-why, we do
not know, as they do not resemble tortoises. The Clear Fork
Dart 3 and 4 types which are classed with Tortugas points
in the Handbook are quite distinct in the flint-knapping
techniques, and only resemble the others in having a general
triangular shape.

Clear Fork Dart types 3 and 4 were probably used much
later than types 1 and 2 during the thousands of years of
duration of the Clear Fork Culture, but the main marker
of this culture is the Clear Fork gouge, which has always
been found with all four types of these darts where they
occur in pure culture deposits .

.

The authors of the Handbook did a vast amount of hard
work in producing this book. The effort was worthwhile,
as it is something which had long needed doing. Only those
who have burned the midnight oil for years in similar endeavors are in a position to appreciate how much work
has been done. The text needs revision by scholars and
scientists who will ruthlessly cull out some mistakes and
omissions in terminology and credits which should not go
unchallenged.
609 Orange St.
Abilene, Texas

Editor's Note: Most of the "mistakes and omissions" in terminology which Dr. Ray has pointed out did not arise from
any wish to ignore his well-known researches for many
years in the Abilene area. Rather, they were simply the
result of divergent opinions on what constitutes a type of
artifact. Dr. Ray's published types were the result of his
observations and studies in that particular part of Texas.
On the other hand, in preparing the Handbook, we were
trying to create valid types from great numbers of specimens from many parts of Texas, which gave rise to many
very difficult problems in determining the range of variation
which could be included in each type, and in determining
where to make the divisions between forms that overlapped
in every possible way.
Certainly we made no claim that any of the Handbook
types were better than those described in print by Dr. Ray,
or should supercede them: they are simply different because
they were formulated in a different way. Thus, if Dr. Ray
thinks there are really 11 different types in what we illustrated as Bulverde, seven or more types in the Pedernales

Comments Concerning Type Names

277

photographs, etc., he is certainly entitled to think so, but
he should also present the detailed type descriptions needed
for others to understand his reasoning.
I believe now, that to be consistent, we should not have
used any of the type names coined by Kelley, for he has
never published any detailed descriptions or adequate illustrations of any projectile-point types; in fact, far less than
Dr. Ray has. In any case, we could have made our position
clearer at some points in the Handbook and avoided such
misunderstandings. I apologize to Dr. Ray for not specifically stating that some Handbook types were not supposed
to agree with his conceptions, even though there is some
overlapping in regard to individual specimens.
In such cases as "side-notched triangular", "pine-tree",
and "bifurcated", these are not type names in the modern
sense, but only roughly descriptive names for basic shapes.
In North America as a whole there are several distinct types
which could each be called "pine-tree", etc., so that when
we applied a name such as Perdiz, we had in mind a much
more specific form. As to Pinto points in Texas, it is true
that some of the Texas "bifurcated" points are practically
identical to some of the California Pintos, but what about
all the rest of them? Almost any type will inevitably overlap in some degree with another type in the same area or
another area; so how can the typological problems be solved
without a great deal of comparative work over large areas?
Artifact typology requires continual change and adjustment
as more is learned about the ranges of variation and how
they are distributed. Thus there are no types, in my opinion,
which can be set up once and remain valid forever; and
when different workers conflict in their conceptions, I know
of no method for determining who is closest to the truth
except that everyone interested should keep testing the
suggested types against facts of distribution in time, space,
and cultural association.
As to the question of who first discovered and named the
Clear Fork Culture, of course there is not the slightest doubt

278

Texas Archeological Society

in anyone's mind that it was Dr. Ray. He seems to have
missed the significance of our enclosing "Clear Fork Focus"
in quotation marks when referring to Kelley. We did this
deliberately to distinguish such a "Focus" from Dr. Ray's
Clear Fork Cultv.re. On pages 106-107 of the text, we clearly
stated that we did not know what the evidence was for
distinguishing this "Focus" from the others grouped b y
Kelley under Edwards Plateau Aspect, and therefore would
lump them all under the general term of Edwards Plateau
Aspect. I realize now that the use of quotation marks did
not really explain anything and repeat that this positively
was not meant to deprive Dr. Ray of any credit in priority
for the Clear Fork Culture.
It is fortunate that Dr. Ray has taken this opportunity to
set the record straight on priority of terminology, and perhaps this brief explanation will clear the air somewhat.
