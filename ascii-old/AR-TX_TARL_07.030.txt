ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AT THE THREE
RIVERS FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT: A FINAL REPORT

INTRODUCTION
This report details the results of the final phase
of archeological investigation of the proposed Three Rivers
Flood Protection Project conducted by the Texas Archeological
Survey for the Fort Worth District, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, and represents the fifth in a series reporting on
the effects of this project on definable cultural resources.
The Three Rivers Flood Protection Project is a plan of
improvement under which the city of Three Rivers will be
protected from major flooding by the construction of a levee
east of the Frio River.

Initiated east of the city (near

site 41LK228), the 4.6 mile long levee will extend northward
to encircle three-fourths of the city, terminating at site
41LKl14 (Fig. 1).

The earthen fill for construction will

be alluvial materials procured from selected barrow areas.
During the initial phase of archeological assessment
in 1975, nine prehistoric sites were recorded by the field
survey; six of these would have been adversely affected by
the project construction as then designed (Mallouf 1975).
In 1977, alterations in the engineering design and
levee placement necessitated additional surface survey and
a reassessment of recommendations offered in 1975.

Sites

41LK57, LKl13 and LKl14, located by the original survey,

INTRODUCTION

2

and one newly recorded site, 41LKl16, were evaluated as
endangered and meriting test excavations (see Mallouf 1977).
Later that year, testing of sites 41LK57, LK113, and
LK114 was completed by the Texas Archeological Survey.

Of

these three, only LKl14 seemed to retain sufficient struc­
tural integrity to merit controlled subsurface sampling and
to meet the criteria for nomination to the National Register
of Historic Places (see Prewitt and Scott 1977).
In 1979, additional surface survey of the proposed
borrow areas and of a high probability area near the southern
terminus of the levee resulted in the recording of three
prehistoric sites.

The high probability area was designated

as site 41LK228, and was recommended for subsurface sampling
(Dibble 1979).
In September and October of 1979, final mitigation
of sites 41LK114, LK116, and LK228 was carried out by Texas
Archeological Survey staff members Molly B. Godwin, Gene
P. Davis, and Mary Jane McReynolds, under the field super­
vision of James R. Pliska.
Original estimates suggested that work at the three
sites could be accomplished in thirty calendar days by a crew
of four.

Unfortunately, a number of circumstances beyond

the control of the excavators prevented the most efficient
possible use of the allotted time.

3

INTRODUCTION

At 41LKl14. the landowner was unwilling to permit
the use of power equipment.

All excavations had to be

carried out using hand tools, which effectively precluded
the possibility of opening up extensive portions of the
site in a single week.

In addition, the property owner's

agricultural schedule was such that the crew was actually
permitted only four days on the site, including the time
required to manually backfill those areas which had been
excavated.
Work at 41LKl16 was complicated by the discovery that
the site was approximately four times the size indicated
by earlier field investigations (Mallouf 1977).

Naturally,

this dramatically decreased the percent of the site area
which could be excavated with the allotted time and personnel.
Investigations at 41LK228, like those at 41LKl14, were
hampered by the landowner's prohibition of power equipment.
Another, and perhaps an even more serious problem was that
the crew was restricted, by the property owner, to the
eastern and most disturbed portion of the site.

An earlier

survey (Dibble 1979) indicated the presence of intact fea­
tures and relatively heavy artifact concentrations in
exactly those parts of the site from which the excavators
were excluded.
Given these constraints of time and equipment, it
was not possible to open up large segments of any of the

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

sites.

4

Instead, test pits were placed in various parts of

each site, and those units which appeared productive were
excavated further.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The Three Rivers project area is located in northern
Live Oak County, Texas, in the Nueces River basin near the
confluence of the Atascosa and Frio rivers with the Nueces
(Fig. 1).

The Atascosa joins the Frio about two miles

northwest of the city; the Frio and Nueces converge two
miles downstream, south of the city.
Topographically, the Three Rivers area is characterized
by gently rolling land cut by the wide, flat floodplains of
the rivers.

The elevation ranges from 100 to 200 feet AMSL.

The project area lies within the Gulf Coastal Plain
physiographic zone (Fenneman 1938).

Three Rivers, which

lies near the center of this belt-like region, has an annual
precipitation of approximately 26 inches.

The mean annual

temperature is 70 0 F., indicating a fairly mild climate.
The prevailing winds are southwesterly, and average about
8 miles per hour {U.S. Corps of Engineers 1975}.

Major

climatic events are the result of hurricanes originating
in the Gulf of Mexico.
GEOLOGY
The study area lies within the central portion of

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

5

the Texas coastal plain, an erosional area of gently rolling
topography broken only by cuestas of the resistant Catahoula
and Oakville deposits.
The geologic formations in Live Oak County are of
Eocene to Holocene age.

Rocks in these formations are sedi­

mentary in origin, the results of major depositional events
brought about by structural changes and by subsidence of the
coastal plain.
The Eocene is represented in Live Oak County by the
interbedded

sands~

muds and impure lignite of the Jackson

Group {Eargle. Hinds and Weeks 1973}.

These are overlain

by the Oligocene Fayette and Frio Clays, upon which the
Catahoula Formation rests unconformably.
The Catahoula Formation is composed of deposits from
the Gueydan fluvial system of the Rio Grande Embayment
(Galloway, Finley and Henry 1979).

Tuff, clay, tuffaceous

sand, tuffaceous clay, and conglomerate beds rich in chert.
chalcedony~

opal and quartzite make up the Catahoula of

South Texas.
Next in the geologic evolution of South Texas was
the deposition, during the Miocene, of the Oakville and the
subsequent Fleming/Lagarto formations.

The overlying Goliad

Formation was deposited during the Pliocene, as were the
quartzite, jasper and chert-rich Uvalde gravels.
In Pleistocene to Holocene times, valley incision

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

6

and the topographic modifications caused by sea level fluc­
tuations have combined to create the existing coastal plain
topography.
At the Three Rivers sites, the Catahoula tuff forms
the basal unit; the outcropping formations are of recent
alluvium.

The area contains an abundance of lithic mater­

ials appropriate for aboriginal exploitation.

The Uvalde

gravels occur along hilltops and ridges; cobbles of Catahoula
cherts and chalcedonys occur as gravel deposits along the
stream channels and terraces of the Frio River.
SOILS
The Oakville Formation and the underlying Catahoula
Formation form the rolling topography along the Frio River
valley.

Both include pyroclastics (tuffs, volcanic ash

and bentonitic clays), sediments which have had a great
impact on the pedogenic processes.

In the arid to semiarid

climate of the study area, weathering of this type of
parent material produces montmorillonite, a major clay
constituent of the soils of the area, and also results in
the precipitation of calcium carbonate nodules (Galloway,
Finley and Henry 1979).

The soils in the study area are

generally level to undulating, moderately deep, calcareous,
and loamy to clayey in texture.

7

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

FLORA
Inglis (1964) described this portion of South Texas
as the Rio Grande Plain.

It is included by Blair (1950)

in the Tamaulipan biotic province, and described by him as
a savannah of grasses and mesquite.

Tharp (1939) character­

izes the area as a mesquite-chapparal region.
cription

Blair's des­

best approximates the area of the Three Rivers project.

The Tamaulipan province is dominated by thorny brush­
land, although live oak (Queraus virginiana) is often found
in stands on the floodplains.

The dominant brush vegetation

is cha ra cte ri zed by mes qui te (P.pos.opus juZifZor'a) , Aaaaia.,
Mimosa., granjeno (Celtis pallida) , lignum vitae (PorZiera
augustifoZia), cenizo (LeueophylZum texanum) , white brush
(AZoysia texana) , prickly pear (Opuntia Zindheimeri),

tasajillo (Opuntia Zeptoaaulis), Condalia and CasteZa.
Clay-based soils usually support all of these species, while
on sandy soils, open stands of mesquite surrounded by various
grasses are more typical (Blair 1950).

Before land manage­

ment practices, and especially overgrazing, altered the
plant community, dominant grasses included Arizona cottontop,
buffalograss, curly mesquite, longspike silver bluestem, and
species of Setaria., Pappophorum., and Bouteloua (U.S. Corps
of Engineers 1975).
The Three Rivers area contains, in addition, a number
of species other than those considered to dominate the entire

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

Tamaulipan province.

8

A small vegetation sample, collected

along the Frio River during the 1975 archeological survey,
yielded the following items: ash, mulberry, hackberry,
mesquite, chinaberry, oak, turk's cap, pidgeon berry, wooly
bucket, camphor weed, dewberry, morning glory, mustang grape
vine, sedge, bristle grass, Spanish moss, frog fruit, ruellia,
green briar, pannic grass, tickle tongue and sump weed
(Mallouf 1975).

FAUNA
The regional fauna of the Tamaulipan province includes,
or has recently included, at least sixty-one species of mammal,
thirty-six snakes, nineteen lizards, two land turtles, three
urodeles and nineteen anurans (Blair 1950).

The major mammals

of the area, which were probably exploited by the aboriginal
occupants, include the opossum, shrew, mole, armadillo, jack­
rabbit, cottontail, fox squirrel, ground squirrel, pocket go­
pher, various species of rat and mouse, gray wolf, coyote, black
bear, ringtail, raccoon, coati, weasel, badger, skunk, cougar,
bobcat, javelina, and whitetail deer (Blair 1952: 236-247).
Major native fowl are the mourning and white-winged dove, quail
and wild turkey (Blair 1950, 1952).

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
A general culture history and chronology for South

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

Texas has been established, and is summarized in works such
as Hester and Hill (1975), Hester (1976) and Hester (1977).
Until recently, however, there was very little professional
archeological research within Live Oak County itself.
A generalized temporal schema employed for South
Texas is composed of four cultural stages:

Paleoindian

(pre-10,000-8,000 B.P.), Archaic (8,000-800 B.P.), Late
Prehistoric (800 B.P. to European contact) and Historic.
These stages have been defined on the bases of subsistence
strategy and artifactual and geographic associations.
The Paleoindian Period is the earliest cultural stage
recognized in South Texas.

It is generally considered as a

big game oriented hunting tradition for which the late
Pleistocene megafauna provided a substantial portion of the
subsistence base.

The 8,000 B.P. terminal date for the

period corresponds approximately to the time of significant
post-Pleistocene extinctions.

The major time-diagnostic

artifacts of the period are lithic, especially projectile
points such as the

CZOVi8~FoZ8om~

ScottsbZuff~

PZainview~

Meserve and San Patrice types.

The Archaic Period economy was based on more diversi­
fied hunting and gathering.

A variety of diagnostic lithic

assemblages, as well as cultural features such as hearths,
burials, pits, trash middens and burned rock concentrations,
are typically associated with the known archeological record

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

10

of the Archaic.
The Late Prehistoric Period is marked by technological
innovations such as bone-tempered ceramics and the bow and
arrow.

Considerable variation exists in the lithic and

ceramic assemblages of the period.
The Historic Period is considered to start after
European

contact~

and may include the remains of either

indigenous or intrusive cultures.
Organized archeological research in Live Oak County
began in 1967 when W. H. Wakefield of the Texas Archeological
Salvage Project

9

The University of Texas at Austin, reported

on eighteen sites located during a survey of the proposed Choke
Canyon Reservoir (Wakefield 1968).

Paleoindian and Archaic

materials were recognized at that time.

Seven years later,

Sorrow, O'Malley and Fox (1974) of the Texas Historical Commis­
sion reported upon further reconnaissance in the same area.
Their survey recorded 129 sites of Archaic, Late Prehistoric
and Historic age.

9

In 1977, further survey of the Choke Canyon

Reservoir was completed by the Texas Historical Commission
(Lynn, O'Malley and Fox 1977), bringing the total number of
recorded sites in the project area to 161.

The cultural

material reported was representative of the Paleoindian to
Late Prehistoric periods.

Recently, the Center for Archaeo­

logical Research, The University of Texas at San Antonio,
has been investigating Paleoindian through Historic remains

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

11

in the Choke Canyon area for the Bureau of Reclamation's
Nueces River Project (Hall 1980).

In

exces~

of 400

sites have been identified by that project, and somewhat
less than 10 percent of those merited further investigation.
Intensive excavations are projected for five of the identi­
fied sites.
Archeologists from the State Department of Highways
and Public Transportation are currently analyzing artifactual
material recovered from excavations at site 41LK28, an occu­
pation and cemetery site containing over 160 burials.

The

analysis of these materials is expected to shed new light on
Archaic life styles and burial patterns (Johnson 1980).
Limited excavations were carried out by the Center
for Archaeological Research, The University of Texas at San
Antonio, at 41LKI06, a prehistoric site on Sulphur Creek.
Artifacts recovered suggest Middle to Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric occupations (Creel et ala 1979).
Archeological assessments in the Three Rivers Flood
Protection Project area were initiated in 1975 by the Texas
Archeological Survey.

The first survey located one historic

and nine prehistoric sites (Mallouf 1975).

In 1977, changes

in the design of the proposed levee necessitated additional
archeological coverage.

Three prehistoric sites and one

multi-component (historic and prehistoric) site were recorded
(Mallouf 1977).

Later that same year a testing operation

12

METHODOLOGY

was carried out by TAS at sites 41LK57, LK113 and LKl14
(Prewitt and Scott 1977).

In 1979, field investigation

of two proposed borrow areas and the southern terminus of
the levee yielded three additional sites (Dibble 1979).
The final mitigation of sites 41LKl14, LKl16 and LK228
reported herein resulted from recommendations derived from
these previous assessments of the project area.
METHODOLOGY
The excavation plan at sites 41LK114, LKl16 and LK228
followed essentially the same format.

At each site, an

arbitrary Cartesian (x and y) grid was established by tran­
sit to provide horizontal control.

The grids were aligned

to magnetic north, with grid coordinates increasing to the
north and west from a zero coordinate, defined as NI00/W100
at 41LKll4, and as N1000/W1000 at 41LKll6 andLK228.

Each

excavation unit is deSignated by the coordinates of its
southeast corner.
Vertical control was based upon the excavation of 10
or 20 cm. arbitrary levels, maintained by below-surface
elevations measured from the southeast stake of each unit.
Datum was established designating the surface level at the
zero coordinate stake as 100 meters.
Unit levels were excavated by hand, using trowels
and shovels.

The matrix from each unit was dry screened

through -!-" wire mesh.

All material recovered in the screens

was collected, with the exception of some calcium carbonate
nodules.

Collected material was placed in bags labeled to

indicate provenience by unit and level.

At the conclusion

of each excavation level, a General Record Form was filled
out, noting matrix characteristics, observed cultural material,
and other pertinent information.

The recording system also

included profile drawings, and photographs of the soil
matrix at each site.
All records and archeological material collected
during the course of these excavations are housed at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of
Texas at Austin.
Three 1 x 2 and one 1 x 1 meter units were excavated
at 41LKl14.

At 41LKl16, four 1 x 2 meter units and two 50 x

50 cm. test pits were excavated.

Since power equipment was

permitted at this site, it was also possible to dig four
backhoe trenches which were helpful in determining the extent
of the cultural deposits and the nature of the soil deposi­
tion.

Excavations at 41LK228 included four 1 x 2 and two

1 x 1 meter units.

The site maps (Figs. 3, 6 and 8) indi­

cate precise unit and trench locations.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
41LKl14
Site 41LK114 is approximately 0.5 mile north of the
city of Three Rivers and 0.25 mile west of U.S. Highway
281 (Fig. 1).

The site is in a recently plowed field on a

high terrace knoll overlooking a tributary of Hackberry
Creek approximately 0.5 mile east of the confluence of
Hackberry Creek and the Frio River (Fig. 2a).

At the time

the work was performed, the field was planted in a hay
fodder cultigen which, being approximately waist high, ob­
scured surface visibility.

Fences border the field on all

sides, and it is bounded on the west (downslope) side by the
Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks.

The cultural material is

approximately 60 x 60 meters in extent (Fig. 3).
The site lies in alluvial sediments overlying a
Pleistocene terrace remnant of compact, red-brown, mottled
clay.

This older alluvial terrace remnant was encountered

only in Unit 7 (N85/W100).

The other units contained sandy

clay soils forming from recent Holocene alluvium.

Unmodified

stream rounded pebbles and colluvial lag cobbles are present
in the soil matrix, in frequencies which increase downslope
from Units 4 and 5 toward Unit 6.
Three 1 x 2 and one 1 x 1 meter units were hand
excavated; Unit 4 (NIOO/WIOO), Unit 5 (NIOO/W70), Unit 6

(N100jW130) and Unit 7 (N85jW100).
UNIT 4
The location of this unit was selected largely on the
basis of a noticeable surficial concentration of burned and
fire-cracked rock in this portion of the site.

Such con­

centrations may reflect subsurface strata, or may be indica­
tive of relatively intact hearths beneath.
Unit 4 contained culturally and nonculturally intro­
duced stream-worn gravels within a matrix of brown, calcar­
eous sandy clay.

This matrix exhibits characteristics of a

Fluventic Ustochrept, a subgroup of the Inceptisol order
(Fig. 4).

These soil types are formed in alluvium on low

terraces in subhumid to semiarid regions (U.S.D.A. 1975).
Root and rodent disturbances were observed at all levels and
contributed to the mixing of the culturally introduced
material and the soil matrix.
Initially, 10 cm. vertical levels were excavated.
Beginning with Level 6 (50-70 cm. b.s.), the levels were
increased to 20 vertical cm. and the horizontal extent of
the unit was reduced from 1 x 2 to 1 x 1 meters.
continued to 150 cm. below the surface.

Excavation

Cultural material

was encountered at all levels within the sandy clay matrix;
no features or major artifact concentrations were located.

The most common snails

are Polygyra and Rabdoda; the mussel which prevails is
Uniomerus tetralasmus.

UNIT 5 (N100/W70)
The unit was placed on the crest of the knoll in an
attempt to define the nature and extent of the cultural
deposits in the area.

An elevated area such as this was

considered as a probable locus of high density aboriginal
activity.
This 1 x 2 meter unit was excavated to 80 cm. below
the surface.

The soil matrix was similar to that of Unit 4

in color and structure except for a decrease in the amount
of gravel.

This is a result of past fluvial processes in

which the heavier bedload was deposited along the flank of
the terrace,

decreasi~g

near the higher elevations.

Cultural Material
Culturally introduced material was recovered from all
levels of this unit.

No features or noticeable concentrations

of artifacts were encountered.

Again the cultural deposits

appeared altered by bioturbation.
No time-diagnostic artifacts were recovered.

Only two

utilized flakes were noted; one secondary Group IV and one
tertiary Group II.

See Appendix I for a listing of cultural

materials and their provenience.
Fa una 1 Rema ins
Eight bone fragments were recovered from Unit 5.

The

four identifiable specimens are a possible rodent tibia
(Neotoma sp.) and two pelvic fragments and a right calcaneum

of a cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus) recovered from
the same level (20-30 cm. b. s.).
Shell Remains
The shell remains are similar to those described for
Unit 4.
UNIT 6 (N100/W130)
Unit 6 was situated on the midslope portion of the
site, in order to define the nature and extent of the cultural
deposits on the slope.

The fluvial deposition of sediments

might have protected intact features or provided stratigraphic
separation in this area.

24

SITE DESCRIPTIONS

Unit 6, a 1 x 2 meter unit, was excavated to 60 cm.
below the surface midslope in the site area.

The soil

matrix was sandier with a higher frequency of stream-worn
gravels and less lag cobbles.

The soil was much coarser

in texture and much less cohesive than that found upslope.
This results from deposition of the coarser material while
the suspended load was carried away by receding floodwaters.
Cultural Material
Although cultural material was recovered from all
levels of this unit. the amounts were significantly lower than
at either Unit 4 or Unit 5.

The only increase was in the

noncultural1y introduced gravels and lag cobbles.

No features

One utilized

Group IV tertiary flake was recovered.
Faunal Remains
The seven bone fragments recovered from Unit 6 are too
fragmentary to identify.
Shell Remains
No significant molluscan remains were recovered from
Unit 6, and no terrestrial snails were present.

The absence

of terrestrial snails, usually attracted to the organic
remains at human habitations, may reflect an extremely
limited period of residence at this portion of the site.
In view of the midslope location of Unit 6, it is also
possible that the cultural material was deposited by slope

the lack

of molluscan remains at Unit 6 may thus be explained.
UNIT 7 (N85/W100)
This area was selected for excavation because it is in
a relatively undisturbed portion of the site, close enough
to the fenceline to have avoided the worst effects of plowing.
It was hoped that an intact feature or artifact concentration
might thus be encountered.
While testing this area, Prewitt and Scott (1971)
encountered a Pleistocene terrace remnant of brown-red mottled
clay less than 30 em. below the surface.

This strata was

encountered in Unit 7 at 35 cm. below the surface, and was
color coded at 5YR 4/3 (Munsell Products

1973).

Cultural Material
No features or artifact concentrations were located
in Unit 7.

A single oval hammerstone was recovered 20 to 40

cm. below the surface.

It is a quartzite cobble with a

battered surface and wear predominantly along its edges
(Fig. 5e).
Faunal Remains
No faunal material was recovered from Unit 7.
Shell Remains
None were recovered from Unit 7.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS

41LKl16
During the initial survey (Mallouf 1977), this site
was calculated to be 150 x

50 meters in extent.

Before

the placement and excavation of units was begun, crew members
made a surficial inspection of the site, walking straight
line transects and exploring the entire field.

In areas

where cultural material was encountered, flagging tape was
used to delineate the site area and denote possible major
surface concentrations of cultural material.

Based upon

this procedure, the site dimensions were recalculated at
250 x 120 meters, an area four times the size originally
estimated (Fig. 2b).
Within the site limits, two major surficial concen­
trations were noted.

One consisted of the western portion

of the site, near the paved road (Fig. 6).

Units 1 and 2

were placed in this area to test its subsurface components.
The second major surficial concentration of material is along
the eastern margin of the site, adjacent to the Frio River.
Units 3 and 4 were located there.
The archeological excavations at 41LKl16 consisted of
four 1 x 2 meter test units and four backhoe trenches.

The

trenches were used to establish the nature and extent of
cultural debris and the character of the soil matrix.

In this

part of the Frio River floodplain, the dominant soil type is
a Typic Pellustert Vertisol formed by the effects of climate

deposited by overbank flooding (Fig. 7).
One wall of each backhoe trench was troweled clean
and recorded as a profile drawing.

During work on the eastern

wall of backhoe trench 4, several chunks of burned clay were
noted in the southeast corner, 22 cm. below the surface and
directly below the plow zone.

This concentration of burned

clay was exposed, and was designated Feature 1.
Feature 1 (Fig. 5)
This concentration of burned rock, burned sandstone,
rounded chunks of burned clay and a burned flint cobble
covered a horizontal area roughly 20 x 26 cm., and ranged
from 22 to 28 cm. below the surface.

The concentration

appeared to be a hearth remnant, mixed vertically and horizon­
tally by the shrink/swell characteristics of the Vertisol
soil matrix.
Associations:

two unburned freshwater mussel hinges

and a primary flake, as well as several small flecks of
charcoal, were recovered from within Feature 1.

UNIT 1 (N990/W970)
A 1 x 2 meter unit was excavated in a location which
exhibited a concentration of surface materials.

Cultural

material was present throughout the 40 cm. of soil excavated,
but no features or artifact concentrations were noted.

UNIT 3 (N968/Wl164)
This 1 x 2 meter unit was excavated to determine the
nature and depth of cultural material adjacent to the Frio
River.

An area with a high surface density of archeological

material was selected and excavated to a depth of 40 cm.

At

the 20 to 40 cm. level, the unit was reduced to 1 x 1 meters.
Cultural material was present in both levels,but artifact
density decreased with depth.

The soil matrix exhibited the

same characteristics as that of the two previously excavated
units.
Cultural Material
No cultural features or artifact concentrations were
observed.

Artifacts recovered include five prehistoric

sherds, and three tertiary Group I, one secondary Group I,
one tertiary Group III and one tertiary Group IV utilized
flakes or chips.
The five sherds were located in the plow zone.

They

are small (less than 2 cm. in largest dimension) fragments
of a sandy paste ceramic with bone tempering, gray core, and

SITE DESCRIPTIONS

exterior color ranging from orange to light brown.

32

These

sherds may be from the same vessel but the edges are too
worn to piece together.
Faunal Remains
The two bone fragments recovered from this unit are
too small to identify.
Shell Remains
Mussel shell was present but this unit contained less
than any of the units excavated at LKl16.
UNIT 4 (N1000/Wl173)
This unit was placed near the Frio River in hopes of
recovering a larger, more diagnostic ceramic sample.

Unit 4

was a 1 x 2 meter unit excavated to 80 cm. below the surface.
At level 3 (40-60 cm. b.s.) the unit was decreased to 1 x
meters and at level 4 (60-80 cm.) to 1 x .60 meters.

The

soil matrix was slightly sandier and lighter in color than
in previously excavated units.
Cultural Material
No cultural features or artifact concentrations were
observed.

The lithic artifacts recovered include two thin

biface fragments and a thick biface.

The latter is elliptical

in outline, plano-convex in cross section, and has sinuous
edges.

The dorsal surface retains some cortex, and the

ventral side is slightly concave due to fracturing.

Of the

33

thin biface fragments, one is a crudely shaped distal portion;
the other is a basal fragment with thinning along the base
and secondary retouch along one edge.

Both are so fragmentary

that their general shape cannot be determined.
Faunal Remains
None were encountered during Unit 4 excavation.
Shell Remains
More mussel shell was recovered in this unit than in
Unit 3, but stgnificantly less than tn Units 1 or 2.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS

41LK228 is slightly shallower and contains greater concen­
trations of carbonates than does LKl14.

Rodent and root

disturbances were present in all levels excavated and prob­
ably contributed to mixing of the cultural materials.
Prehistoric cultural material is distributed over an
area approximately 100 x 120 meters (Fig. 8).

A historic

component consisting of earthenware and glass sherds,
metal fragments and square nails is attributable to oil well
drilling operations conducted during the early 1900's.

The

landowner stated that a drilling rig crew camped in the area
about 80 years ago.
Excavations at 41LK228 consisted of four 1 x 2 meter
and two 1 x 1 meter units.

These units were restricted to

the eastern flank of the site at the request of the landowner.
Previous survey had described intact hearth remains and a
heavier concentration of artifactual material at the crest
of the knoll (Dibble 1979).

Therefore, the units described

below cannot be considered representative of, or to have
fully explored the potential for, archeological recovery at
41LK228.
UNIT 1 (N1010/W1000)
Unit 1, a 1 x 2 meter unit, was excavated to a depth
of 80 cm.

This initial unit was placed where a concentration

of material was surficially visible.

The soil matrix was a

Rodent disturbances were noted

in every level.
Cultural Material
No features or artifact concentrations were observed.
Lithic artifacts recovered include two abrading stones. one
thick biface basal fragment and one thin biface distal frag­
ment.

The eight utilized flakes can be categorized as two

tertiary and one secondary Group I, two tertiary Group II,
one tertiary and one secondary Group III and one tertiary
and one secondary Group IV.
One abrading stone is almost an equilateral triangle;
the sides range from 2.0 to 2.5 cm. in length.

Only one

The material is a dense sandstone.

The other abrader ;s a crude triangle of white tuffaceous
sandstone.

Two parallel, rounded channels approximately 7

cm. wide and 5 cm. deep are worn into the longest side of
the specimen.
Burned rock, burned clay and other cultural debris
recovered are listed in Appendix I.
Faunal Remains
Only one of 16 bone fragments recovered is identifi­
able - the distal portion of a right humerus of white tail
deer (OdocoiZeus virgineanus).
Shell Remains
Mussel shell and terrestrial snails are listed in
Appendix I.

UNIT 2 (N980/W1000)
Unit 2, a 1 x 2 meter unit, was excavated to a depth

The soil matrix was similar to Unit 1 with an

increased frequency of rodent and root disturbances.
Cultural Material
No features or artifact concentrations were encountered.
Eleven utilized flakes consisted of four tertiary and one
secondary Group I, two tertiary Group II, one tertiary Group
III and three secondary Group IV.
Faunal Remains
The eight bone fragments recovered were unidentifiable.
Shell Remains
The quantity of shell recovered is similar to Unit

r.

UNIT 3 (N1000/W1010)
Unit 3, a 1 x 2 meter unit, was placed as close to the
crest of the knoll as the landowner would permit.

The unit

was excavated to a depth of 60 cm.; the first 20 cm. was
not screened because of the disturbed condition of the sur­
face.

Rodent disturbance was evident in all levels.
Cultural Materials
No features or artifact concentrations were encountered.

Lithic artifacts recovered include one thick biface, one
thin biface basal fragment and one thin biface distal fragment.

Rodent disturbance contributed to the

apparent mixing of materials.
Cultural Material
The only lithic artifact recovered is one thick biface

Faunal Remains
No faunal material was recovered from Unit 6.
Shell Remains
The frequency of shell in this unit was considerably
less than in the other units.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS*
All artifacts and culturally introduced material were
computer coded according to level, unit and site.

The exca­

vated level was selected as the primary unit of analysis

*In addition. see Appendix II for a discussion of the
limitations of chi square as a determinant of diminishing
returns.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

42

because of the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered.
Ceramics, all lithic categories, silicious wood and sandstone
fragments, mussel shell hinges and snails by species were
coded as frequencies; burned rock, burned clay, snails,
mussel shell, calcium carbonate concretions and gravels
were analyzed by weight (grams).
To compensate for the differences in horizontal and
vertical dimensions of the arbitrary levels a Fortran program
was employed to convert all frequencies and weights to a
density equivalent to a one m2 unit and a 10 cm. level.
However, any comparisons using sites as the unit of analysis
should take into consideration the total volume excavated at
each site. The four units and 22 levels at LKl14 total 3.52
m3 , four units and 11 levels at LKl16 equal 5.2 m3 , and six
units and 20 levels at LK228 equal 6.8 m3 volumetrically.
The mixed deposits and lack of discernable features
or living surfaces which characterizes these sites effectively
eliminated the potential for meaningful analyses of intrasite
variability.

In addition, the small sample size gained from

all three sites cannot be considered as statistically adequate.
The results of the statistical analyses are presented as a
summary of the salient characteristics of these sites (Appendix

1).
Descriptive statistics and a preliminary principal
components analysis of the primary data were used to select

43

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

pertinent variables for further analysis.

Ceramics, dart

points, hammerstones and abraders were eliminated because
of their low frequency.

The weights of mussel shell and

snail were selected as more representative of the total
population than are frequencies of identifiable species
or portions of the shell.

The obvious high correlation

between these interrelated variables (frequencies and weights
of the same category) created a redundancy acceptable in
factor analysis but of no utility in further analysis.
The fifth princpal factor derived by the preliminary
analysis was bipolar with high loadings for calcium carbonate
concretions (-.5941) and mussel shell (.8104).

This corre­

lation was determined to be artificially derived from the
presence of CaC03 at LKl14 and its virtual absence at LKl16,
the source of most of the mussel shell, and biased by
collection techniques (see Methodology section).

Calcium

carbonates are considered to be a natural phenomenon and
were removed from further analysis.

Gravels were retained,

although most are naturally occurring, because collection
techniques were similar.

Gravels are a convenient identifier

of 41LKl14.
Factor analyses (orthogonal) were performed on both
the primary data and the computed densities.

Five factors

with eigenvalues greater than 1., accounting for 73 percent

44

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

of the variance, were produced; a sixth factor (eigenvalue
.96) accounted for an additional 6.9 percent.

One expected

correlation, between burned rock and burned clay, was not
evident; this was attributed to the orthogonal solution.
The factor analyses were rerun using an oblique rotation.
Once again, five factors were derived which accounted for
100 percent of the variance.
Given the susceptibility of factor analysis to manip­
ulation through selection of variables and factoring method,
slight variation in the ordering of factors is to be expected.
The recurrent correlations are summarized as a composite of
the results of each method.

One primary factor carried high

loadings for secondary and tertiary flakes, chips. petrified
wood and burned rock.

These categories. with the exception

of petrified wood which is absent at LKl16, are present at
all three sites and can be considered as a generalized pattern
of co-occurrence.

Snails and burned clay are highly corre­

lated and are often accompanied by a moderate loading for
utilized flakes.

This relationship is probably the result

of snail exploitation of human occupation rather than the
reverse.
Cores, primary flakes and gravels are aligned on the
same factor.

This could be designated as the IILK 11411

factor for the site where the preponderance of these arti­
facts was recovered.

Bone and mussel shell tend to be

45

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

unique to their separate factors; an occasional addition of
bifaces to the mussel shell factor is not confirmed by the
primary data and may result from the conversion of a low
frequency (bifaces) to a density factor.

The communality

of the variable biface is low, implying its contribution to
common variance is negligible.
The oblique structure matrix seems to most truly reflect
the patterning of the data.

In this solution the lithic cat­

egories load on two factors as in the orthogonal solution,
separating cores and primary flakes from the remainder of
the debitage; burned clay and snails replicate their previous
association and the correlation between burned rock and burned
clay seen at LKl14 is indicated by similar moderate loadings
on the first factor.
The factor analyses served to delineate patterning in
the artifact assemblages.

Discriminant function analysis was

employed to examine the intersite variability.

A step-wise

discriminant function (using Rao's V as the criterion) of
both primary and transformed data determined the major differ­
ences in the composition of assemblages recovered from the
three sites.

One option of discriminant function is to

determine the cohesiveness of the a priori group, in this
case, the site.

In other words, are they distinct entities

or do they share common characteristics to the extent that
one site is indistinguishable from the other?

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

three sites yielded an artifact assemblage unique enough to
separate them in statistical space, implying perhaps func­
tional or temporal discreteness_
Site 41LKl14 is characterized by the heavy concentra­
tions of burned rock, burned clay, the presence of cores,
primary flakes, petrified wood and the only hammerstone
recovered in the excavations.
41LKl16 is distinguished from LKl14 and LK228 by the
relative absence of burned rock, burned clay, bone (possibly
a function of differential preservation), sandstone and the
presence of mussel shell in abundance.
41LK228 differs from LKl14 in the absence of cores,
primary flakes and petrified wood and in the increased quan­
tity of burned clay and the co-occurring snails.

Ten of the

fifteen bifaces or biface fragments were recovered here.

The

snail species Rabdoda predominates at LK228; Polygyra are
more evenly distributed between the three sites, perhaps
indicative of differing habitats.
A literal interpretation of the results of these two
statistical analyses would imply that 41LKl16 was primarily a
mussel collecting locale, as could be presumed from its loca­
tion close to the river.

41LKl14 and LK228 reflect more

characteristics of multi-purpose encampments.

The emphasis

on initial lithic production seen at 41LKl14 is plausible in
view of the proximity to raw materials.

41lK228 lacks

47

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

specialized attributes and can not be easily categorized.
The characteristics which set these sites apart
statistically are only functionally interpreted.

The paucity

of time-diagnostic artifacts recovered precludes any infer­
ences about seasonal exploitation or contemporaneous occu­
pation.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
During September and October of 1979, archeological
excavations were carried out at sites 41LKl14, 41LKl16 and
41LK228, prior to the construction of the Three Rivers Flood
Protection Project.
These three sites have all been subjected to surface
and shallow subsurface disturbance by plowing, and all showed
evidence of considerable post-depositional bioturbation.
Excavation in each case confirmed that substantial mixing
of the archeological deposits had resulted from this biological
activity.

At 41LKl16, the difficulties were compounded by

the soil matrix, a Vertisol with extreme shrink/swell charac­
teristics.

Agricultural terracing at 41LK228 had further

dispersed the upper zones.
All three sites are located close to water sources.
Sites 41LKl14 and 41LK228, however, are topographically more
suitable for extended occupation.

Situated on high terrace

knolls) these locales are less susceptible to flooding.

48

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSl"ONS

41LKl16. located on the floodplain, would have been frequently
inundated; the Vertisol soils here would retain moisture after
floods or rains for longer periods than the well drained soils
at 41LKl14 and LK228.
Few diagnostic artifacts were recovered during the
current series of' excavations, precluding time isolation of
the occupations of these sites.

The

DarZ~

BuZverde and

Tortuga dart points recovered at 41LKl14 imply that this

site was occupied at least during the Late Archaic Period.
The five small bone-tempered ceramics found in the 0-20 cm.
level at 41LKll6 are characteristic of the Late Prehistoric
Period.

Although no time-diagnostic artifacts were recovered

at 41LK228 during the course of this excavation, a side-notched
(Ensor) dart point, assignable to the Late Archaic, was col­

lected from the surface during the 1979 survey (Dibble 1979).
Given the mixed strata, the lack of cultural features
or structural integrity, and the paucity of diagnostic arti­
facts. no attempt has been made to quantitatively interpret
intrasite variability.

The archeological

assem~lages

can

best be interpreted by observing the generalized intersite
patterns of co-occurrence and variability.
The primary component of the cultural material recov­
ered from 41LKl16 is mussel shell.

Burned rock and burned

clay occur here in significantly smaller quantities than at
the other sites.

The topographic situation is more conducive

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

to short-term occupation.

49

The artifact assemblage, the site

location in the floodplain, and the proximity to the Frio
River all imply that 41LKl16 was utilized primarily as a
mussel collecting station.
Sites 41LKl14 and LK228 share many characteristics
such as their topographic location on high well-drained
terrace knolls.

Burned rock. burned clay, lithic debitage

and mussel shell are all included in the cultural materials
recovered from both sites.

Site 41LKl14, however, is distin­

guished by the numerous cores and primary flakes recovered;
this site is close to a lithic resource, the outcrops of the
Catahoula Formation.
A functional interpretation of site 41LK228 is impeded
by the lack of specialized attributes.

Similarities to the

41LKl14 cultural materials lie primarily in the quantities of
burned rock and mussel shell; burned clay is more abundant at
LK228.

However, the units excavated at 41LK228 cannot be

considered a representative sample of the archeological con­
tent.

The crest of the knoll, the area of highest surface

artifact density, was also the least disturbed by agricultural
modifications.

This area of the site, which held the most

promise for intact archeological deposits. was not sampled.
On the basis of subsurface examinations of sites
41LKl14, LKl16, and LK228. no further work is warranted.
However, due to the access restrictions at 41LK228. the full

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

potential of this site was not explored.

50

Care should be

exercised during construction of the levee in order to avoid
damage to the cultural deposits still extant in the crest
of this knoll.

A Comment on the Use of
Chi Square in Diminishing
Returns Analysis

SoZveig A. Turpin

A COMMENT ON THE USE OF CHI SQUARE
IN DIMINISHIKG RETURNS ANALYSIS
The current emphasis on on-going statistical tests for
diminishing returns in archeological excavation is intended
to provide the field archeologist with a replicable, defini­
tive guide for determining redundancy in artifact recovery and
to provide a numerical justification for termination or contin­
uation of excavation.

In addition, objectivity supposedly

supplants, or augments, subjective judgmental decisions of
the archeologist.
Although no statistical test has been specified, chi
square has been used as the determinant of diminishing returns.
Presumably, chi square was chosen because it is nonparametric
and is easy to perform on a hand calculator.

Our experience

in the analysis of the Three Rivers Flood Protection Project
excavations has indicated that chi square does not achieve the
objectives outlined above.
Chi square is a test of independence, or of association,
with no predictive power and no causality implied.

Only the

significance of the deviation of the observed from the
expected values is determined.

The direction of this relation­

ship is not indicated.
By extension,

t~is

implies that the validity of the

observed and expected frequencies is of primary importance.
Chi square may be applied to one sample or to many - in the

60

APPENDIX II

61

case of archeological investigations we may consider the sample
(or the comparative entities) as levels in a unit, one level
in multiple units, multiple levels in multiple units, or unit
versus unit.

We could even extend this to include units or

levels in one site compared to another site, or the entire
recovery from one site versus another.

However, let us

restrict ourselves to the most logical choice - one or more
levels compared to equivalent levels in one other, or all
other, units in one site.

This we will then consider the

analytical unit.
The preferred comparative classes of artifacts have
been lithic.

Because chi square requires an expected frequency

greater than five, time-diagnostic projectile points and other
rare or unusual items are excluded from consideration.

Another

assumption of chi square, that only frequencies may be compared,
excludes those cultural remains catalogued by weight or by
percentages.

This is compounded at Three Rivers by the dif­

fering dimensions of units and levels excavated in which the
observed recovery may have been removed from. 10 m3 to .40 m3
volumetrically.

Conversion of these frequencies to densities

reduces the expected to less than five for most classes of
artifacts.

In the limited assemblage recovered from Three

Rivers, the categories that fulfill these assumptions are
secondary and tertiary flakes, chips and mussel hinges.
the following paragraphs, we will liberally interpret the

level.
The consideration of comparative classes now broadens
our options once more to include a choice of one or more
artifact classes within a level or a unit.

A selection must

be made from this array of numbers or the objective of ease
of computation is defeated.

In essence then, the choice of

comparative units and classes becomes a subjective, judgmental
decision on the part of the field archeologist.
Let us, however, assume the most appropriate choice of
analytical units and comparative classes has been made and
proceed to a hypothetical situation in which chi square could
fail to detect redundancy.

A two component site is being

excavated; the first two equivalent units are typical of
Component A, the third reflects the assemblage of Component
B.

If we excavate a fourth unit of Component A, the chi square

comparisons of Unit 3 and Unit 4. or of all four units simul­
taneously, could indicate new material is being recovered.
However, if Unit 3 is tested against Units 1 and 2, redundancy
would be indicated.
A more tangible example can be taken from the enclosed
data from 41LKl16.

The chi squares calculated for all four

units using frequencies of secondary and tertiary flakes and
mussel hinges are all significant at the .05 level.

The chi

APPENDIX II

63

square computed comparing tertiary flakes from the first two
units indicates redundancy; the addition of the third unit
excavated produces a significant chi square.

"Diminishing

returns" is literally the reason for this significance; we
are recovering significantly less material from this unit.
By this logic, excavating beyond the perimeter of the site
could be consistent with producing a significant chi square
as long as we keep our expected frequency above five.
In the few cases where densities met this assumption,
the computed chi square was approximately half of the statis­
tic derived from comparison of frequencies.

As our degrees

of freedom are dependent on the number of units and levels,
this lowered chi square affects the significance drastically.
The sites excavated at Three Rivers are not ideal for
a test of chi square as an indicator of diminishing returns.
We cannot compare levels overlying features or test for dis­
crete stratigraphic levels or components.

However, the utility

of this test supposedly lies in its objective capabilities.
What has resulted from the analysis of Three Rivers is that
the significance of chi square depends on subjective decisions
of the archeologist - the choice of analytical units and com­
parative

classes~and

the interpretation of causality.

Further­

more, without some explicit guidelines or detailed reporting
of the choices made, the replicability of the test is ques­
tionable.

By manipulation of classes and units, almost any

desired "significance" can be gained through interpretation
of the results.
