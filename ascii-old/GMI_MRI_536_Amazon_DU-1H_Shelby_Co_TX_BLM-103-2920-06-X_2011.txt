EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey for the proposed Amazon DU #1H
well pad location in eastern Shelby County, Texas. This cultural resources investigation was
conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., under subcontract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC, for
XTO Energy, Inc., and for the Bureau of Land Management. The purpose of this document is to
provide data for use in the management of cultural resources in partial fulfillment of obligations
under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (P.L. 96-515), as amended,
and other cultural resources legislation. Cultural resources investigations consisted of a records
search to identify previous cultural resources surveys conducted in the area and the archeological
and historic sites recorded by those efforts, visual inspection of the project area, and subsurface
investigations via the excavation of screened shovel tests and the examination of exposed soil
profiles. Fieldwork for this project was conducted on 22 November 2010 and 18–19 January
2011. Site 41SY348, a twentieth-century domestic midden, was documented as part of this
cultural resources survey. The site is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places. This survey encountered no significant cultural resources in the
project area. Construction of the Amazon DU #1H well pad will have no adverse effect on any
significant cultural resources. Provided the project is carried out as proposed, no further cultural
resources investigations are recommended. In the unlikely event that any cultural materials are
inadvertently discovered at any point during the construction, use, or maintenance of the well
pad, all work should cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission and Bureau of
Land Management should be notified of the discovery.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report presents results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., (GeoMarine Project No. 30563.02.08) under subcontract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC,
for XTO Energy, Inc., for the proposed Amazon DU #1H well pad and associated lease road
(Bureau of Land Management [BLM] Lease No. TX NM 124678). The proposed project area is
located on an interfluve between Grannies Creek and an unnamed tributary in eastern Shelby
County, Texas (Figure 1). The intersection of Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 139 and County Road
(CR) 22521 is located immediately to the southeast of the project area. The community of
Huxley, Texas, is located approximately 4 kilometers (km; 2.5 miles [mi]) to the southeast.
The Amazon DU #1H project area consists of a 5.5-acre well pad and lease road right-of-way
(ROW). The landscape encompassing the proposed project area is composed of agricultural
operations and managed timberlands. This proposed well pad infrastructure will be constructed
on private property owned by Billie Kay of Shelbyville, Texas. The mineral rights, however, are
the possession of the BLM, and this project is therefore under the oversight of that agency. This
work was conducted under BLM Cultural Use Permit No. 103-2920-06-X for review by the BLM
Field Office in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Fieldwork for this project was initially conducted on 22
November 2010 by Geo-Marine Project Archeologist Christopher Goodmaster and Field
Technician Bethany Oliver. Due to modifications to the final location of the proposed well pad,
additional cultural resources survey was required. This additional fieldwork was conducted by
Principal Investigator Melissa Green, Christopher Goodmaster, and Field Technician Brett Lang
on 18–19 January 2011. Melissa Green served as the project Principal Investigator throughout
the process of this investigation. As per BLM cultural resources survey requirements, a minimum
buffer area of 10 acres was surveyed around each of the proposed well pad locations. This
resulted in the cultural resources survey of approximately 31.3 acres for this project.

CHAPTER 2
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

The proposed project area is located on the interfluve between Grannies Creek and an unnamed
tributary in the eastern portion of Shelby County in East Texas. The project area is situated in the
Tertiary uplands of the South Central Plains (Griffith et al. 2004). The soils of the region are
derived from in situ weathering of the underlying Wilcox Formation (Griffith 2006). This area is
located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943). Often referred to as
the Pineywoods (Gould et al. 1960), this region once supported a diverse variety of flora and
fauna.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
Shelby County is located within the South Central Plains physiographic region of Texas. This
region is characterized by rolling or hummocky plains underlain by the stratified shales and
sandstones of the Wilcox Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1993). The project area is
located within the Tertiary Uplands subregion of the South Central Plains in the Sabine River
basin. The proposed project area is situated on the northeastern-facing slope of an interfluvial
ridge (Figure 2) at an elevation range of 67 73 meters (m; 220–240 feet [ft]) above mean sea
level (amsl) on slopes of 0–5 percent.

HYDROLOGY
The project area is within the Sabine River basin. Numerous unnamed, small-order drainages
extend across the floodplains and rolling uplands of the area, creating a complex network of
streams, swamps, and sloughs. The proposed project area is located largely on a dissected
interfluvial ridge between Grannies Creek to the south and an unnamed tributary of Grannies
Creek to the northeast (see Figure 2). Grannies Creek joins the Sabine River at the Toledo Bend
Reservoir approximately 1 km (0.6 mi) to the east.

3

SOILS
The Amazon DU #1H project area is situated across three soil series and one soil complex (Table
1; see Figure 2). The generally level portion of the interfluvial ridge is mantled by soils of the
Metcalf-Timpson complex. Prominent rises are mantled by Lilbert series loamy fine sand. The
slope along the northern margin of the interfluve is characterized by very fine sandy loams of the
Eastwood series, and the alluvial channel of the unnamed drainage occupies an area of fine sandy
loams mapped as the Owentown series. All information regarding the soils of the project area has
been synthesized and summarized from data provided by the Soil Conservation Service (Griffith
2006) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (2010).

Metcalf-Timpson Complex
The Metcalf-Timpson complex consists of intermingled areas of the relatively poorly drained silt
loams of the Metcalf series with moderately well-drained loams and very fine sandy loams of the
Timpson series. Metcalf series soils are classified as Glossaquic Paleudalfs whereas Timpson
series soils are classified Oxyaquic Glossudalfs. Metcalf soils exhibit A and E horizons, 8–20
centimeters (cm; 3–8 inches [in]) in thickness, of dark grayish brown and light yellowish brown
silt loam, respectively, overlying a series of yellowish brown loam Bt horizons to a depth of 76
cm (30 in). Areas of Timpson soils are typically characterized by a dark grayish brown silt loam
A horizon between 0–18 cm (0–7 in) with E-BE sequence of yellowish brown to strong brown
fine sandy loam overlying a series of strong brown to yellowish brown loam Bt horizons to
depths of over 100 cm (39 in).

Lilbert Series
Lilbert series soils are classified as loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Plinthic
Paleudults. These soils are very deep and well drained, formed in sandy to loamy marine
deposits. The typical surface layer consists of a thin (0–10 cm [0–4 in]) A horizon composed of
grayish brown loamy fine sand overlying two E horizons of light yellowish brown to pale brown
loamy fine sand to a depth of approximately 60 cm (24 in). A Bt horizon of yellowish brown
sandy clay loam is common to depths from 60–80 cm (24–32 in), above a plinthite-rich Btv
horizon of brownish yellow fine sandy loam to depths of 97 cm (38 in).

5

Eastwood Series
Eastwood soils are classified as fine, smectitic, thermic Chromic Vertic Hapludalfs. These soils
are well drained but very slowly permeable and formed in weakly consolidated marine deposits of
silty clay loam texture on slopes of 1–20 percent. The surface layer typically consists of dark
yellowish brown fine sandy loam 8 cm (3 in) thick, underlain by a light yellowish brown and
strong brown E/B horizon of very fine sandy loam with few redoximorphic features, which might
range from 20–30 cm (8–12 in) below surface. The subsoil is typically characterized by a series
of thin (13 cm [5 in]) red clay Bt horizons overlaying a C horizon at 129 182 cm (51 72 in)
below surface.

Owentown Series
Owentown series soils are classified as coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, thermic Oxyaquic
Dystrudepts. Formed in loamy alluvium along streams, these soils are moderately well drained
and moderately permeable. The surface layer consists of a thin (0–10 cm [0–4 in]) A horizon
composed of dark yellowish brown loamy fine sand. This surface horizon overlies a series of
yellowish brown, brownish yellow, and brown loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam Bw horizons,
each approximately 25 cm (10 in) in thickness to a depth of about 127–203 cm (50–80 in).

FLORA AND FAUNA
This region is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943) and
supports a variety of flora and fauna. The environs encompassing the project area consist of an
array of subtropical terrestrial communities. These ecosystems support a diverse range of fauna,
including several endangered or threatened species. The Sabine and Angelina rivers support a
diverse biotic community, characterized by hydrophilic vegetation and numerous aquatic
vertebrates and invertebrates that include 32 varieties of mussel (Unionidae) and 104 species of
freshwater fish (Dahm et al. 2005). Mammal species in the area, either presently or historically,
include deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cougar (Puma concolor), feral hogs (Sus scrofa), black
bear (Ursus americanus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.), opossum (Didelphis
virginiana), and raccoon (Procyon lotor).
Once blanketed by oak-hickory-pine forests, the area now supports loblolly and shortleaf pine and
is locally referred to as the Pineywoods (Gould et al. 1960). As the name implies, coniferous
forest ecosystems dominate much of the region, although variations in soil types, topography, and
drainage allow for areas of native hardwoods such as oaks (Quercus sp.), elms (Elmus sp.),
hickories (Carya sp.), pecan (C. illinoinensis), black walnut (Juglans nigra), tupelo (Nyssa sp.),
sweetgum (Liquidambar sp.), and others. Shortleaf (Pinus echinata), longleaf (P. palustris), and
loblolly pine (P. taeda) are the three native species of southern yellow pine. Uplands may harbor
certain hardwoods, such as post oak (Q. stellata) and blackjack oak (Q. marilandica).
Bottomlands near rivers and other major drainages are most often dominated by native
bottomland hardwoods such as water oak (Q. nigra), cherrybark oak (Q. pagoda), nutall oak (Q.
nuttallii), black hickory (C. texana), bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis), black tupelo (N.
sylvatica), and sweetgum. Dense understory growth may often be found in forest areas in the
form of woody shrubs and small trees such as yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), wax myrtle (Myrica
cerifera), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), rusty blackhaw viburnum (Viburnum
6

rufidulum), and other species. In recent years, invasive species such as Chinese tallow (Triadica
sebifera), Japanese climbing fern (Lygodium japonicum), and soda apple (Solanum viarum) have
become well established throughout the Pineywoods as well. Much of the general area is
managed coniferous timberlands.

CLIMATE
The climate of the project area is humid and subtropical. The weather typically consists of hot
summers with high humidity and short winters because of the influence of the Gulf of Mexico.
Average annual precipitation measures approximately 135 cm (53 in), primarily as rainfall
distributed uniformly throughout the year. The average summer temperature recorded in nearby
Center, Texas, is around 27 degrees Celsius (°C; 80°Fahrenheit [F]), and the average winter
temperature is 8°C (47°F), with temperatures seldom dropping below 0°C (32°F).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

This chapter presents a brief synopsis, based on regional archeology, of Native American cultural
chronology and Euro-American history of Northeast Texas. Given the size of the region and the
depth and breadth of cultural complexity that has developed in the area, this discussion must
necessarily be limited in scope. References are provided to supplement the information
summarized here.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The earliest known inhabitants of the Pineywoods of Northeast Texas were the broad-spectrum
hunter-gathers loosely referred to as the Paleoindian culture. Over several thousand years, these
nomadic people adopted more restricted territories and targeted the abundant game and other
resources in the region, typically moving in seasonal rounds to procure various foods and raw
materials. During the subsequent cultural period, referred to as the Archaic, populations
generally continued this way of life for several millennia based on the abundant nature of
resources in the Pineywoods region. By the Middle Archaic period, the people of Northeast
Texas began cultivating starchy and oily seed plants and, in the Late Archaic period, became
active in expansive intraregional social networks based on trade and shared religious beliefs.
Gradually, the Archaic lifestyle became increasingly sedentary, due in part to increased reliance
on horticulture and the development of ceramics. By the Woodland period, the manufacture and
use of ceramics became widespread. The Woodland period continued to expand in cultural
complexity for at least a millennia, resulting in an increase in settled villages, the expansion of
extensive long-distance trade networks, the construction of burial mounds and the development of
elaborate ritual practices, the domestication and cultivation of native plants, and the rise of
societies led by hereditary leaders. From these roots developed the foundation of the Caddo
culture. Over the last millennia, the Caddo settled in permanent villages and continued the
development of maize agriculture and other effective methods of food gathering, processing, and
storage, as well as elaborate ritual life, ranked societies, mound-building, ancestor veneration,
ritual and political centers, long-distance exchange, warfare, competition, and sophisticated craft
production.

HISTORIC EURO-AMERICAN ERA
The period of European exploration and settlement and the subsequent Euro-American and
African-American development of Northeastern Texas is briefly discussed in the remaining
portions of this chapter to provide a historic context for the evaluation of 41SY348. For more
extensive treatments of this period in North Texas, see Peter and Cliff (1990:Chapters 3 and 7)
and Peter et al. (1991:Appendix J).

Spanish and French Colonization (A.D. 1542–1803)
The initial European penetration into the general area of North Texas occurred in the middle of
the sixteenth century (ca. 1542) when the survivors of the Hernando de Soto Spanish entrada, led
by Luís de Moscoso de Alvarado after de Soto‘s death, entered Texas in their attempt to reach
New Spain by land (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Weddle 1985). Although Moscoso‘s exact
route is unknown, archeological studies indicate that he apparently traversed the Red River valley
9

somewhere between present-day Shreveport, Louisiana, and Texarkana, Texas. The party
crossed the Red River and journeyed through northcentral Texas to present-day Wichita Falls
before returning to the Mississippi River to travel to the Gulf of Mexico.
In the late 1600s, the Spanish introduced the first of their missions into East Texas. The goal of
these missions was to eradicate the indigenous religions and to Christianize the native
populations. The Spanish established missions—San Francisco de los Tejas and Santísimo
Nombre de María—in the Hasinai area in 1690, but abandoned them in 1693 when failing to
convert and control the local population (Swanton 1942:46–49).
The French, led by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, first ventured into eastern Texas by
establishing Fort Saint Louis in 1685 along the central Texas coast in present-day Victoria
County (Davis and Bruseth 2000; Fort St. Louis 2009; John 1975:182), and in 1714, Louis
Juchereau de St. Denis set up a trading post at Natchitoches, in present-day Louisiana. Spanish
fear of an increased French presence in Texas led to the decision in 1716 to try again to establish
a series of missions and presidios in present-day East Texas—a second Mission San Francisco de
los Tejas near the Neches River this time, Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción (later
relocated to the San Antonio area in 1731) on the Angelina River, the Nuestra Señora de
Guadalupe at present-day Nacogdoches, San Jose de los Nazonis in northwestern present-day
Nacogdoches County—as well as Nuestra Señora de los Ais and San Miguel de Linares de los
Adaes in present-day Louisiana as a buffer against further French encroachment into that region
(Cooper et al. 2003; Pool 1975:28; Swanton 1942:46–49). When France and Spain went to war,
the French at Natchitoches attacked the Spanish settlement of Los Adaes, forcing the Spanish to
abandon the area once again (Newcomb 1961:288). After the truce in 1721, Spanish
representative Marques de Aguayo persuaded the French to withdraw from Texas. He
reestablished the missions and set Los Adaes as the capital of the Province of Texas.
In the Red River area, the French established Le Poste des Cadodaquious in present-day Bowie
County in 1719, and explored what is now Franklin County (Harper 2002). Bénard de la Harpe‘s
1719 trading post (which became known as the Nassonite Post) on the Red River north of
present-day Texarkana was the first European settlement in the Great Bend (Cooper et al. 2003;
Kelley and Coxe 1996:21). Another effort by Spain to curb French influence occurred in 1760,
when Fray Jose Francisco de Calahorra y Saenz led an expedition to present-day Rains County to
make peace with the Native American tribes in Northcentral Texas. These trading posts
eventually served as illicit trading centers between the two European colonies: modern-day
archeological investigations have yielded artifacts of both Spanish and French origin that would
suggest that the different cultures interacted at the trading sites. After briefly regaining control of
the area, the French sold it as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.

American Immigration (A.D. 1806–1830)
Following the sale of Louisiana to the United States in 1803, Anglo-American immigration into
North Texas intensified, although for a number of years it was not clear who actually owned the
area south of the Red River. The United States considered it (and indeed, most of Texas) to be
part of the Louisiana Purchase and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939).
Spain (and later Mexico), on the other hand, was violently opposed to this view, and at several
times during the first few decades of the nineteenth century the dispute nearly led to war (Smith
1991). The first official Anglo-American penetration of the region was by the Freeman-Custis
10

Expedition of 1806, which was turned back at Spanish Bluffs, along the Red River, by a Spanish
military force (Flores 1984). Early on, the area of Shelby County became known as a refuge for
outlaws and fugitives for its proximity to the ―neutral ground,‖ a disputed area between Spanish
and American territories until 1806 (Coleman et al. 1984; Neill 1950).
By 1818, John Latham, the first Anglo-American resident of Shelby County, settled in the
southeastern portion of the area (Harper 2009). However, during that time Mexico restricted
settlements near the boundary of Texas, curtailed legitimate settlements, and encouraged
squatters, resulting in violence and low population of the area (Harper 2009). In addition, the
already existent population of outlaws and fugitives was not a positive in attracting settlers to the
area (Coleman et al. 1984). The Mexican government first organized Shelby County as a
Tenehaw Municipality, which was part of the Nacogdoches Municipality, and established
Nashville as the county seat in 1824 (Coleman et al. 1984; Harper 2009).
Despite Spain‘s claim, North Texas was too close to the United States not to fall into the AngloAmerican sphere of influence, and settlement continued. The earliest settlements were confined
to the areas immediately adjacent to the Red River, but after 1818, settlement pushed into the
prairies along river tributaries and early roads such as Dayton‘s Road and Trammel‘s Trace, the
present western boundary of Panola County (LaGrone 2008). Trammel‘s Trace, a popular
immigrant route into Texas after 1813, crossed the Sulphur River at Epperson‘s Ferry and
continued southwestward through Cass County to Hughes Springs, founded in 1839, and then
south to cross Cypress Creek 2 miles west of modern Jefferson (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:793–
794). Dayton‘s Road was a major east–west overland route that ran along the divide between the
Sulphur and Red rivers.
The original Anglo-American settlers in Texas were largely subsistence farmers residing on small
holdings, with an economy based on grain and livestock production (Peter and Cliff 1990:36).
The commercial production of cotton apparently was not introduced until the 1830s (Fehrenbach
1968), a shift that was accompanied by increasing numbers of slaves into the region.

Texas Independence (A.D. 1836–1846)
As settlers began to move into Texas, they remained initially under Spanish and later under
Mexican control until the struggle for Texas independence in 1836. For the most part, North
Texas was beyond the direct sphere of the conflict associated with the fight for Texas
independence: that conflict played out primarily in South and Central Texas in 1835 and 1836.
The most significant change thereafter involved decrees by President Mirabeau Lamar, the
second president of Texas, to make the settlers of the Texas Republic safe from marauding Native
Americans by adopting an Indian removal or extermination program. Active efforts to drive off
or exterminate the Native Americans in North Texas had been under way for some time. In one
instance in 1837, a group of Texas Rangers under the command of Lt. A. B. Van Benthuysen
camped on Turtle Creek in present-day Dallas County after conducting raids on Indians to the
north (Maxwell 2002). Subsequently, many native groups who used the Trinity River basin
relocated north of the Red River.
In 1836 the Congress of the Republic of Texas officially named the county after Isaac Shelby,
who was a Revolutionary War hero and governor of Kentucky (Coleman et al. 1984:19; Harper
2009). The town of Center officially became the county seat in 1866 and currently retains this
title (Harper 2009). From 1840 to 1844 a series of small, armed conflicts known as the
11

Regulator-Moderator War occurred as a result of fraudulent land transactions and land titles
(Coleman et al. 1984:19; Harper 2009). Although the war caused significant economic
devastation, the county was able to recover, and by 1847 the population had grown to
approximately 3,500 residents (Harper 2009).

Early Texas Statehood (A.D. 1846–1861)
Texas traded its independence for U.S. statehood on December 29, 1845, entering the union as
the twenty-eighth state. The majority of the settlers moving into Shelby County came from other
Southern states and thus introduced large-scale agriculture, livestock raising, and slavery into the
area (Harper 2009). Because slave ownership was not as predominant in Shelby County, it was
primarily restricted to white upper-class Anglo-Americans (Harper 2009). During the antebellum
period, the county was, for the most part, rural and agricultural, with most of the county‘s
residents living on farms (Harper 2009). The largest crop of any kind and the most important
food crop was corn (Harper 2009). However, continuing with the Southern tradition, cotton was
grown and sold, making it the largest cash crop for the county (Harper 2009). Additionally,
farmers grew oats, raised cattle, sheep and hogs, and sold wool for profit (Harper 2009).
Texas, however, did not remain a state for long. Sectarian politics were raised to a fever pitch
during that period, and after the presidential election of 1860, Texas began to consider secession.
The sympathies of most of the Anglo-American residents of North Texas lay with the secessionist
southerners; after all, a majority of them had immigrated from the South, the region as a whole
had a substantial slave population, and the cash economy of the area was built on slave-based
agriculture even though most of the individual farmers could not afford to own slaves. In most of
Northeast and Northcentral Texas, anti-Union feelings ran high (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306),
and nearly all the counties in the area voted to secede—though some, like Delta County, did
support Sam Houston‘s Unionist forces during the early part of the war (Hervey 1951). On
February 1, 1861, Texas became a part of the Confederate States of America. Shelby County‘s
white inhabitants overwhelmingly supported the secession movement during the winter of 1860–
1861 (Harper 2009). When the secession ordinance was submitted for popular approval in
February 1861, county voters approved the measure by a vote of 333 to 28 (Harper 2009).

Civil War (A.D. 1861–1865)
The white residents of Shelby County wholeheartedly supported the war effort of the
Confederacy (Harper 2009). One county source estimated that as many as 750 men from Shelby
County served in either Texas or Confederate army units (Harper 2009). Shelby County was
never occupied by Union forces and thus escaped the destruction that devastated other parts of the
South. However, the people and the economy still suffered with drops in demand, fluctuations in
currency, an increase in competition for resources, and loss of friends and loved ones (Harper
2009).
Northeastern Texas escaped serious, direct effects from the Civil War, being too far west of the
centers of fighting to the east and south to be affected by Union forces, and too far east of the
frontier to be affected by the resurgence of Native American problems that accompanied the
withdrawal of U.S. and Texas military forces (Pool 1975:110–113). The defeat of the
Confederacy in 1865 brought with it the end of slavery in Texas, the breakdown of the old slavebased plantation system, and the presence of a Union army of occupation.
12

Postbellum Texas (A.D. 1865–1920)
The end of slavery brought many changes in the economy of rural Northeast Texas. Lacking the
cheap and dependable labor resources provided by slavery, the large plantations of the prewar
period ceased to be economically feasible and many were broken up and partially sold off. Most
of the land put on the market found its way into the hands of speculators and investors, with the
result that a new system of sharecropping or tenant farming replaced the old plantation system.
Productive land was now often held by absentee landlords, with the labor supplied by AfricanAmerican or poor Anglo-American sharecroppers or tenants. Although most former slaves
remained in the county, many left the farms seeking better working conditions or establishing
their own farms (Harper 2009). Unfortunately, the majority of former slaves became
sharecroppers, a situation that did not leave much room for improvement from their former
condition (Harper 2009). Gradually, however, a small portion of the black population
accumulated enough capital to move into the class of landowning farmers (Harper 2009). In 1870
one black farmer owned his land, and by 1910 almost one-third of all black farmers were
landowners (Harper 2009). In addition to losing the main source of labor, white farmers also
faced serious plummets in property values. In 1859 slaves constituted 50 percent of all taxable
property in the county, but with the end of slavery and the reduced status of the South, property
values decreased by almost 40 percent, creating serious economic loss (Harper 2009). Although
this system failed to improve the lot of the sharecroppers and tenants, it was a successful
replacement for the prewar system, and by the beginning of the twentieth century, the bulk of the
rural farms in Northeast Texas were operated by sharecroppers or tenants.
After 1870, the population of North Texas began to increase, and the region began to recover
from the worst effects of the war and the subsequent recession. One of the most important factors
in this recovery was the increasing role of the railroad in the regional economy. Before the Civil
War, Shelby County had been predominantly rural, using waterways, mainly the Sabine River, to
export crops to the larger market centers (Coleman et al. 1984:19; Harper 2009). A small amount
of railroad construction had occurred prior to the outbreak of the war, when more than 50 miles of
track had been laid westward from Texarkana in 1857 by the Memphis, El Paso, and Pacific
Railroad. Following the end of the war, construction did not resume for four more years. When
it finally did, though, it continued at a relatively steady rate. In 1871 and 1872, the Texas and
Pacific Railroad went through the southern corner of Upshur County and the eastern portion of
Cass and Marion counties. In 1876, the East Line and Red River Railroad (later part of the
Louisiana and Arkansas) building west from Jefferson, crossed western Marion County and the
southwestern portion of Cass County. In the Pineywoods of northeastern Texas, the Houston, East
and West Texas Railway from Houston to Shreveport was completed in 1882, quickly followed by
the Kansas and Gulf Short Line; the Texas Southeastern; the Groveton, Lufkin and Northern; the
Texas and New Orleans; and the Angelina and Neches River railroads. With the completion of a
local railroad line from Longview into the county in 1885, the already important logging industry
intensified, and continued to do so as the rail line was upgraded and extended to Carthage in 1888
and eventually became part of the Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway (LaGrone 2008). The
Houston East and West Texas Railway was built through the northern portion of the county, and
in 1904 the Gulf, Beaumont and Great Northern Railroad was completed, crossing through the
center of the county from north to south (Harper 2009). New towns emerged along these railroad
routes and developed as important shipping centers (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306). With the
arrival of the railroad, several towns, such as Timpson, Tenaha, and Joaquin, were established
and became quite prominent in Shelby County (Coleman et al. 1984:19; McCoy 1981). As a
result, the lumber business began to grow, providing new job opportunities in industry (Coleman
et al. 1984:19; Harper 2009).
13

The continuing expansion of the railroads after 1870, and the improved communications they
brought, spurred the development of other local industries as well. During that period, lumbering
assumed its place as an important industry in many areas of the Pineywoods of northeastern
Texas (Chandler 1937). The Houston, East and West Texas Railway and the Gulf, Beaumont,
and Great Northern Railroad allowed transportation of lumber from timber-rich Polk, Angelina,
San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Trinity, and Nacogdoches counties. Sawmills to process this
lumber also sprang up throughout these East Texas counties, especially in the town of Lufkin and
Angelina County, which led to innovations for lumber and paper production and provided another
major source of employment (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:824). All of these mills helped supply
raw material to factories located in Texarkana and in other large towns (Webb and Carroll
1952:1:198).
In spite of the steady growth in nonagricultural industries during these years, farming continued
to be important in East Texas, with the small, owner-operated farm still prominent. Despite the
inequities of the sharecropper and tenant systems, the participants were not locked into the system
as had been the case under slavery, and in the last three decades of the nineteenth century
increasing numbers of African-Americans achieved the status of small landowners. Regardless of
their status, they often settled in dispersed rural communities separate from those of their white
neighbors.

Modern Texas (A.D. 1920–Present)
After the Civil War, agriculture and population began a slow, steady increase, and by 1940 the
number of farms and people had increased six-fold since 1870, but the percentage of farm
landowners had decreased from 77 percent in 1890 to 30 percent by 1930 (Harper 2009). Cotton
and corn were still the main crops being harvested by 1940, but most farmers still used the same
old methods used during the antebellum period (Harper 2009). Although there were increases in
crop production and population, prosperity was still limited (Harper 2009). By 1940,
approximately 90 percent of farmsteads were still without electricity and phone lines. Even as
agriculture formed the economic base of the county, manufacturing and industry provided some
jobs and a portion of the income in Shelby County.
After World War II, the population in Shelby County began to decline. By 1940, two major
highways crossed the county: U.S. Highway 96, which traverses the center of the county from
north to south, and U.S. Highway 84, which traverses the northern portion of the county from east
to west. In 1950, the Sabine River Authority was created, and in 1960, Toledo Bend Reservoir
was dedicated (Coleman et al. 1984:22). By 1970, the population was on the rise again; however,
the majority of the inhabitants were between the ages of 35 and 64, indicating that the youth of
the area were still moving out of the county (Harper 2009). Leading industries of Shelby County
included sawmills, poultry and egg processing, road construction, agribusiness, general
construction, and the manufacture of hardwood flooring, hardwood veneer, and plywood.
Mineral resources included lignite coal, sand, oil, and gas. Pine and hardwood production in
1981 totaled 14,867,416 cubic feet, the overwhelming majority of which was pine production
(Harper 2009). The Sabine National Forest also currently contributes to attracting tourists and
providing lumber, grazing, oil production, hunting, and recreation (Harper 2009; Miller and Tull
1984).

CHAPTER 4
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND METHODOLOGY

The cultural resources survey recorded in this document was designed to identify both prehistoric
and historic archeological sites along with important architectural resources located within the
proposed project area. This work was undertaken with two primary management goals in mind:
1. To locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey areas
2. To assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
The first of these goals was accomplished by a program of background and archival research,
intensive pedestrian survey, and shovel test excavations undertaken using the field methods
described in this chapter. The second goal consists of assessment and evaluation based on
National Register of Historic Places criteria defined in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
§60.4 (National Park Service 1990).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN THE PROJECT AREA
To determine previous cultural resources survey efforts as well as the locations of previously
recorded historic or archeological resources in the project area, the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas online database maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) was consulted.
Review of THC records indicated that one previous cultural resources survey has been conducted
within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project area. In 1993, the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service conducted a cultural resources survey within the Sabine
National Forest approximately 1.2 km (0.75 mi) to the north of the proposed project area.
Although further details regarding that survey are not available, no cultural resources were
recorded during that survey, and no cultural resources sites have been previously recorded within
1.6 km (1 mi) of the Amazon DU #1H project area. Numerous prehistoric sites were recorded,
however, during Forest Service survey efforts within the Brawley Creek drainage to the
southwest of the proposed project area. Although outside of the prescribed search radius, site
density in the Brawley Creek drainage suggests that prehistoric archeological site density within
the Grannies Creek drainage may be similar. Therefore, the project area is considered to have at
least a moderate probability of containing prehistoric sites.
15

Various sources of historical and geographic data were consulted to ascertain the likelihood of
historic-era cultural resources existing within the proposed project area. These materials include
historic highway maps, topographic maps, and soil surveys (which often record cultural resources
such as cemeteries, houses, and related features) and aerial photography. Based on a review of
these historic records and previously recorded archeological site locations, it is evident that the
area has experienced a dynamic history. Evaluating these sources with more recent records,
however, indicates that the substantial development has occurred in recent years, altering much of
the historic landscape. Historic period habitation within the region was minimal during the
nineteenth century, but settlement increased markedly during the twentieth century, and several
structures are indicated on historic-period topographic and highway maps of the area. Therefore,
the project area is considered to have at a moderate to high probability of containing historic sites.

METHODOLOGY

Survey Methods
Based on the background and archival research conducted, it was determined that the proposed
Amazon DU #1H well pad project area had a moderate to high probability of containing cultural
materials. Given the amount of groundcover and the nature of archeological sites in the region, it
was assumed that ground visibility in the project area would not be conducive to visual inspection
and that subsurface excavation via shovel testing would be necessary to adequately survey the
area.
Shovel tests consisted of hand-excavated units 30–40 cm (11.8–15.7 in) in diameter excavated in
20-cm (7.9-in) levels, with the excavated soil passed through a 0.64-cm (0.25-in) hardware mesh
screen to recover artifacts. Shovel tests were excavated systematically across the proposed
project area to depths of 1 m (3.3 ft), to the extent of Holocene deposits, or until an obstruction
such as the water table or fragipan was encountered. The location of each shovel test was
recorded with a submeter-accurate Trimble® GeoXT™ global positioning system (GPS) unit,
and the exposed soil profile documented. Each shovel test was backfilled upon completion of the
recording process. Areas that were inundated, waterlogged, or completely disturbed by features
such as roads, stock ponds, or other construction were systematically investigated and
documented, but not shovel-tested. Areas of exposed soil, either on the surface or in profile (e.g.,
cutbanks), were also examined for cultural materials as they were encountered during survey. As
per BLM cultural resources survey requirements, a minimum buffer area of 10 acres was
surveyed around each of the proposed well pad locations. This resulted in the cultural resources
survey of approximately 31.3 acres for this project.

Archeological Site Definition
An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural
resources. The definition of a ―site‖ is therefore contingent on the basis of content and extent.
Content may refer to artifacts recovered from surface or subsurface contexts, architectural
features, or other manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the
horizontal and vertical spatial arrangement of these cultural remains. When only surficial
materials are encountered, a site is defined as five or more cultural artifacts or features of at least
16

two different materials or functional classes located within the same vicinity (typically a 400-m2area [0.1 acre]); the extent of the surface material is then defined as the site boundary. When
artifacts are encountered in buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally
positive excavations. In cases where a shovel test yields cultural materials, additional delineation
shovel tests are excavated to define the boundary of the site. Shovel tests used to define and
delineate a site are typically placed at intervals of 10 m (33 ft) in a cruciform pattern (in each of
the cardinal directions) around the positive shovel test until two negative shovel tests, or the
project area boundaries, are reached. In general, if two or more positive shovel tests are
encountered and contain at least five artifacts of at least two classes of cultural materials, a site is
then defined within the extent of positive shovel tests. Cultural remains meeting these criteria are
designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted to the
Texas Archeological Research Lab (TARL) to be included in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
database. Conversely, the discovery of cultural materials that do not meet these criteria are
considered isolated occurrences of past human activity and are simply documented by location
and content; likewise, modern material representing an obvious single-event trash dump is not
considered a site, with only location and content documented.
Depending on depositional integrity and cultural content, archeological sites can be eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. Isolated artifacts are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP because of
their failure to meet the site definition and their lack of significance in contributing important
information to the archeological record.

Artifact Treatment and Analysis
Each artifact is thoroughly examined in order to identify and determine, to the extent possible, its
function or role and cultural or chronological affiliation within the identified contexts. All
artifacts recovered during this survey were historic period materials. These artifacts were
examined for particular attributes and diagnostic traits using morphological and/or functional
classification systems developed by South (1977). Analysis of the recovered materials assigned
artifacts to one of four primary categories—Activities, Architectural, Domestic (including
Furnishings), and Personal. The Activities category includes nonhousehold items, transportation
items, farm-related equipment, tools, and firearms. The Architectural category includes all items
related to buildings such as brick, mortar, plaster, nails, window glass, and electrical items. The
Domestic category designation is used for items related to food service (tableware) and food
storage (including food preparation and tin cans); a Furnishings classification, a subcategory of
Domestic, encompasses household items such as furniture, stove parts, and lamp glass. The
Personal category generally contains items of individual use such as clothing, buttons, shoes,
dolls, and smoking pipes. Those artifacts such as unidentifiable pieces of glass and metal that
cannot be specifically placed in one of the above major categories are classified as Indeterminate.

NRHP ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a–d]) for evaluating properties for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places are codified under the authority of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set
forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Based on Advisory Council guidelines, any
17

resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register is a ―historic
property.‖ Federal regulations state that ―The term ‗eligible for inclusion in the National
Register‘ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior
and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria‖ (36 CFR §800.2 [e]).
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, the
following four criteria for eligibility are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36 CFR
Part 60.4 (a–d)].

The principal research objective is to determine whether a cultural resources property possesses
the potential to meet to one or more of the above-defined criteria. Therefore, adequate
information on site function, context, and chronological placement from both archeological and,
if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural resources investigations. Because
research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and project design,
determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly
important objective during the inventory process. The objective of this current project was to
locate and define both horizontally and vertically any cultural resources, document and describe
those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

This chapter presents the results of the cultural resources survey and assesses the effects of the
proposed Amazon DU #1H project on cultural resources in the vicinity. Management
considerations and recommendations based on the findings of this survey are presented in the
final chapter.

BACKGROUND AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH RESULTS
Review of THC records indicated that one previous cultural resources investigation has been
conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project area but no archeological sites have been
documented within the search radius. Archival research focused on the historic period settlement
in the immediate vicinity of the project area. The 1863 von Rosenberg map of the Sabine River
valley indicates that Wheather‘s and Myrick‘s Ferry Road existed approximately 2.25 km (1.4
mi) to the south. Several family farms and small communities also existed across the region at
that time. The proposed Amazon DU #1H project area is situated approximately 1.6 km (1 mi) to
the southwest of a homestead or farmstead occupied by the Golden family. In the early twentieth
century, Wimberly‘s Gin was located approximately 1.3 km (0.8 mi) to the south, as evidenced
on the 1937 Sabine National Forest 1:126,000-scale topographic map. By the mid-twentieth
century, several primary structures existed in the vicinity of the project area, as depicted on the
1944 United States Geological Survey (USGS) Logansport 15-minute (1:62,000-scale)
topographic map.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY RESULTS
The proposed Amazon DU #1H project area was intensively investigated to determine the
presence of cultural resources using a combined technique of systematic visual reconnaissance
and the excavation of screened shovel tests. All areas not intensively investigated due to prior
disturbance were documented. Investigations adhered to BLM cultural resources survey
requirements pertaining to minimum buffer areas. Approximately 31.3 acres were investigated
and 81 shovel tests were excavated as part of this cultural resources survey (Figure 3). These 30cm-diameter (11.8-in) screened shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm (7.9-in) levels across the
19

proposed project area, with the final location of each excavation situated to avoid low-lying,
inundated, or disturbed areas and in favor of microtopographic rises and undisturbed contexts,
when possible.
The Amazon DU #1H well pad location is situated on an interfluve between Grannies Creek and
an unnamed tributary stream. The topography of the project area is gently rolling (Figure 4).
Vegetation consists primarily of pasture and a second-growth forest of mixed hardwoods and
coniferous species and a dense understory adjacent to the unnamed tributary (Figure 5). A stock
tank exists along the northern margin of the proposed project area. Soils encountered in the
majority of shovel test excavations typically consisted of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2)
fine sandy loam to a depth that characteristically ranged from 15 to 25 cm below surface (6 to 16
in bs), underlain by brown (10YR 5/3) fine sandy loam transitioning to yellowish red (5YR 4/6)
clay loam by 55 cm bs (22 in bs). A yellowish red clay mottled with red (2.5YR 4/8) clay was
typically encountered at depths below 55–60 cm (22–24 in).
One positive shovel test (Shovel Test [ST] 16) was encountered on a slight rise along the southern
boundary of the project area (see Figure 3). This shovel test yielded a single piece of silicified
wood debitage at a depth of 0–20 cm (0–8 in). No other artifacts were recovered in ST 16 or in
any of the eight shovel tests excavated in 10-m (33-ft) intervals around ST 16. As an isolated
occurrence of past cultural activity, this artifact is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Additional positive shovel tests were encountered near the southeastern corner of the project area
(see Figure 3). These shovel tests yielded artifacts indicative of an early-to-mid-twentiethcentury rural domestic site. Based on the recovery of these artifacts, site 41SY348 was recorded.

SITE 41SY348
Site 41SY348 consists of twentieth-century domestic and architectural artifacts recovered in 10
shovel tests and observed on the ground surface (Figure 6). Although the site is not within the
area proposed for the Amazon DU #1H well pad, it is within the prescribed BLM survey buffer.
Site 41SY348 occupies a relatively level area of approximately 0.64 acres measuring roughly
80 m (262 ft) north-to-south by 60 m (197 ft) east-to-west at an elevation of approximately 67 m
(220 ft) amsl. The site is covered by pasture grasses with little surface visibility (Figure 7). An
irregular erosional escarpment and a modern fence parallel FM 139, likely forming the eastern
boundary of the site (Figure 8). The fence also parallels CR 22521, likely forming the southern
boundary of the site. No shovel testing was conducted within the ROW of FM 139 or CR 22521,
which were constructed below the natural grade of the landscape and were largely disturbed.
Although the eastern and southern boundaries of site 41SY348 were not completed delimited, it is
unlikely that the site extends beyond the project area in these directions based on these prior
disturbances.
Soil profiles examined during shovel testing indicate that the site is situated on an area of very
dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) fine sandy loam overlying brown (10YR 4/3) loam grading
gradually to red (2.5YR 4/6) clay loam mottled with brown loam.

No intact features were encountered either on the surface or in shovel tests at site 41SY348. The
subsurface artifact assemblage from the site (n=46; Table 3) is composed of twentieth-century
materials assigned primarily to the Domestic and Architectural categories. Ten shovel tests
yielded the assemblage, and all material was recovered from within 20 cm (8 in) of the surface.
Architectural material consists of one piece of aqua window glass, six heavily eroded handmade
brick fragments (pre-1903), and two wire nails (post-1910). Among the 16 Domestic ceramics
are two stoneware fragments (one Bristol exterior/no interior, post-1890; and one Bristol
interior/exterior, post-1900). The 14 fragments of whiteware in the ceramics assemblage consist
of one light blue tinted (1880–1930) and one discolored, both body sherds; two light ivory (post1920) basal sherds with a footring; and 10 pure white (post-1890) sherds (n=7 from the same
item), a cup rim (n=1), and two other fragments. Collected Domestic glass fragments are
composed of two table glass fragments (five ash tint [post-1915] refit sherds from a possible vase,
and an opaque milk glass basal sherd with a footring); as well as 10 vessel glass fragments of
aqua, ash tint (post-1915), clear (post-1880), light green, and manganese/solarized (1870s–1920).
Three Indeterminate milk glass angular fragments and six Indeterminate pieces of zinc thin metal
(possibly from a fruit jar cap or band) complete the subsurface artifact assemblage. In addition to
the subsurface artifact assemblage, three surface artifacts (one pure white whiteware sherd and
two glass fragments) were observed and documented along the fence on the eastern side of the
site (see Figure 6).

Site 41SY348 likely represents a midden associated with a twentieth-century residence. A review
of historic maps and aerial photographs of the area indicate that no structure existed at the site.
Members of the Kay family, who have owned the property for several generations, are unaware
of any structure having existed in the vicinity of 41SY348. A primary structure is, however,
depicted approximately 100 m (328 ft) south of the site on the 1944 USGS Logansport 15-minute
topographic map as well as 1952 and 1969 USGS aerial photographs. Prior to 1969, CR 22521
did not exist and there would have been a continuous, gentle slope from this residence to
41SY348.

Given the site‘s minimal, fragmentary, and redundant artifact content, and the lack of additional
features or architectural remains within the project area, the portion of site 41SY348 within the
project area is considered to have little research potential. As such, this portion of the site is not
likely to preserve information important to understanding community and regional development
in Shelby County during the early-to-mid-twentieth century. Although the site could not be fully
evaluated since it extends outside of the project area, it is unlikely that significant portions of the
site are preserved within the ROWs of FM 139 or CR 22521. Thus, it is recommended that
41SY348, as it is currently defined, is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under the criteria
enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4. The site has been documented and recorded with TARL. No further
investigations are recommended for the portion of site 41SY348 within the project area as it is
presently defined.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This cultural resources survey was conducted to document and assess cultural resources within a
31.3-acre area for the proposed Amazon DU #1H project area and to provide adequate and
relevant information for use in the management of cultural resources within the project area. No
previously recorded archeological sites are located within the proposed project area. This cultural
resources survey resulted in the excavation of 81 shovel tests and the documentation of 41SY348,
a twentieth-century domestic midden, within the prescribed BLM cultural resources survey buffer
area.
Site 41SY348 has been adversely affected by ground-disturbing activities associated with modern
agriculture and road construction. The artifact assemblage associated with this site is sparse and
consists of highly fragmentary items typical of twentieth-century domestic refuse. Given the
minimal information potential associated with this site, it is unlikely that it will provide any
additional information relevant to understanding community and regional development in Shelby
County during the twentieth century. Thus, site 41SY348 is recommended to be not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP, under criteria enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4. The location of this site has
been recorded with TARL. No further investigations are recommended within the proposed
project area at this site. It is recommended that construction of the Amazon DU #1H well pad
and associated lease road be allowed to proceed. No historic properties (i.e., cultural resources
eligible for inclusion in or listed on the NRHP) will be affected by the construction of this well
pad or its associated lease road. Provided the project is carried out as proposed, no further
cultural resources investigations are recommended within the surveyed project area. In the
unlikely event that any cultural materials are inadvertently discovered at any point during the
construction, use, or maintenance of the Amazon DU #1H well pad, all work should cease
immediately and the THC and BLM should be notified of the discovery.
