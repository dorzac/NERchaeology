Chapter 5: Radiocarbon Assays

INTRODUCTION AND HISTORY OF ANALYSIS
There are 11 radiocarbon assays from the bench deposits (Table 5.1), but none of
the testing or mitigation projects in other areas of the site have produced any assays.
Seven of the assays are for wood charcoal, and the other four are for the humin fraction
of sediment samples. Samples for radiocarbon analysis were submitted over a period of
several years, and four different radiocarbon labs are involved. Detailed data on each
sample are provided later in this chapter. Only one of the charcoal samples was large
enough for species identification.

In nearly every archeological project that produces radiocarbon results, there are
more samples available than can be analyzed, and some sort of selection process (rarely
discussed in the report) structures the final outcome. In the case of Berger Bluff, the first
samples analyzed were submitted before commercial atomic mass spectroscopy (AMS)
analysis became available, and this has had consequences for the dating program. Some
samples that could more profitably have been analyzed by AMS were expended then.
There remain in the collections, from various proveniences, a number of small bits of
wood charcoal that have not been submitted for analysis.
Table 5.1 lists basic data for the various assays, and further details (including
calibrated dates) are given for individual assays in a later section of this chapter.

NOTES
AA, BETA, and Tx samples are wood charcoal, most of it plotted in place. AMS samples are 13C corrected
for fractionation; for charcoal, a value of -25‰ is assumed; for humin, the value was measured and is
shown in Table 5.3. Tx dates are not 13C corrected. GX samples are on humin fraction of bulk sediment
samples; humic acid extraction was also done on two of these samples but no significant amount of humic
acid was present. The combined sample (field numbers 10+23+24) assayed as Tx 4095 is rejected (see
text). Method: AMS = accelerator mass spectroscopy; LS = liquid scintillation counting

The first sample submitted was Tx 3569, wood charcoal collected from Feature 5,
the hearth exposed in the cutbank. Sonny Timme and I collected this sample on June 26,
1979, while work was in progress in the blufftop excavation block. The sample consisted
of various small bits of wood charcoal scattered across the surface of the hearth which,
when first exposed, was obviously well-baked and fire-reddened. This sample was
submitted by David Brown to the University of Texas Radiocarbon Lab and assayed by
conventional liquid scintillation beta-counting. The sample was small, and despite
counting for three days produced a ±800-year standard error. Had this sample been
analyzed by AMS methods, the standard error could have probably been reduced by a
factor of ten. The chief purpose for submitting the sample was simply to get some idea of
the age of the hearth and verify that it was not recent. Despite the fact that the edge of the
hearth was exposed in the cutbank, it produced what I consider to be a valid age estimate,
although one with an unfortunately large standard error.

All subsequent samples came from the mitigation project (various dates,
November 7, 1979-April 18, 1980) in the bench deposits. The next sample submitted was
Tx 4095, a composite sample consisting of wood charcoal from two excavation units and
one location in the cutbank. The purpose of this sample was to get some kind of age
estimate for the mussel shell-bearing surface visible in the cutbank and in many of the
excavation units. This surface appeared to be a widespread “marker horizon” that might
be recognizable over much of the site, although it is not clearly marked by anything
except scattered mussel shell, and I hoped to obtain a good age estimate that would apply
across the entire bench area. Combining samples from different proveniences was plainly
very undesirable, but all of the samples were clearly associated with the mussel shell
surface, and without AMS methods yet available, there was no way to obtain a second
764

assay anywhere in the deposits short of combining samples. The sample was analyzed (it
too had to undergo extended counting) and produced a date that is clearly far too recent,
with an even larger standard error. The culprit may be the cutbank subsample. In
analyzing organic fractions from buried soils at Lubbock Lake, Haas, Holliday and
Stuckenrath (1986:481) discovered that samples from the walls of excavations that had
been left standing open for several years produced assays that were younger than those
from freshly scraped walls. The cutbank at Berger Bluff was damp from capillary wetting
by the creek; mold growth might have been a source of contamination in the cutbank
sample of wood charcoal.

Two additional samples (AA 2832, wood charcoal, and GX-17035-II, sediment)
were submitted much later in a further effort to produce an age estimate for the shellbearing surface, and these gave much better results.

After the two samples analyzed by conventional beta-counting at the University
of Texas, five more charcoal samples were analyzed by AMS methods (three at the
University of Arizona accelerator facility, two at Beta Analytic using an accelerator
facility in Zurich, Switzerland). These all yielded very plausible dates, but there were a
good many inversions when the uncalibrated midpoints were listed stratigraphically.
Although, as discussed in Chapter 4, bioturbation is believed to be rather minimal
because of phreatic carbonate cementation, the possibility remains that some of the date
inversions could be the result of small-scale bioturbation. With the possible exception of
AA 2831, none of these samples are associated with a feature. Instead, they are wellprovenienced but isolated bits of wood charcoal found in situ.

765

Pretreatment procedure for wood charcoal performed by Beta Analytic consists of
mechanical cleaning, crushing, washing in deionized water, further rootlet removal, an
HCl acid wash, an NaOH alkali wash, and a final acid wash (letter from Darden Hood,
July 18, 1994). No information on pretreatment was provided by the University of Texas
or the University of Arizona facilities, but the protocol used by the University of Texas
lab for charcoal as of 1997 is summarized from the lab’s web site as follows:
Sample is washed with hot water in a USGS sieve to remove sediment, crushed,
boiled for 10-60 minutes in 2% HCl to remove carbonates. Sample is left to cool
and digest in the acid bath overnight, then washed repeatedly with distilled water
until pH is 5.5. Sample is then boiled in 2% NaOH to remove humic acids, left
overnight, then washed repeatedly with distilled water until the pH is 5.5. Because
NaOH tends to absorb modern CO2 during removal of humic acids, the sample is
again immersed in cold 2% HCl and washed repeatedly with distilled water, then
dried overnight at 100° C and given a final visual inspection for contaminants.
On the premise that bulk sediment samples were much less likely to be affected
by bioturbation than small bits of wood charcoal, I decided to experiment with assays on
bulk sediment samples extracted from the archived matrix sample column collected from
unit N11 E101. Four bulk sediment samples were submitted to Geochron Laboratories in
1991 and 1994.

ASSAYING SEDIMENT AND SOIL SAMPLES
Although both buried sediments and buried soils can contain enough organic
carbon for radiocarbon assay, the carbon source differs. Abbott (1996:153-158) provides
a good review of the topic, and Matthews (1985) provides a good review of soil dating.

766

Soils form on stable or slowly aggrading surfaces, where autochthonous organic
matter is added to the surface by annual or perennial plants, then is translocated
downward by bioturbation, accretion of the surface, or both. Because of continual
addition of new organic matter at the surface, the upper part of the soil contains carbon
with greater radiocarbon activity than that in the lower part of the soil. Radiocarbon
assays on soils yield a date (mean residence time) that is an average for the different
generations of carbon present. In cases where part of a soil has been sealed, for example
in sites covered by burial mounds of known age, the sealed part yields older radiocarbon
assays than the uncovered part (Alexandrovskiy and Chicagova 1998). The rate of carbon
cycling is also proportional to temperature.

Sediments contain mostly allochthonous organic carbon that arrives in three
forms: 1) Relatively undegraded, floating litter, organic debris, or driftwood. This matter
either floats or is transported high in the water column and can be deposited as a thin
organic drape after flooding or as more patchy, localized debris deposits. It represents
recent organic matter that is roughly the same age as the depositional event. 2) Degraded
or partially degraded organic matter, either waterlogged wood or organic debris,
dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in stream water, or degraded, particulate humic
substances. It is transported lower in the water column and may be deposited in the form
of patchy debris jams or evenly dispersed in flood sediment packages, and is likely to be
variably aged, but older than the flood event. As an example, Rice and MacCarthy
(1989:45) sampled bed sediment from a creek in Colorado and found the sediment
contained 7% organic carbon on a dry weight basis. Humin represented 58.4% and humic
acid 35.9% of total organic carbon. 3) Finely particulate, degraded humic compounds
adhering to clay particles, transported throughout the water column but deposited only
767

when conditions are right for precipitation of clays. Minor amounts of autochthonous
organic carbon can also accumulate on floodplain surfaces from in situ vegetation growth
(in which case the sediment might be considered an entisol or fluvent by soil scientists).

Floodplain vegetation patches and topographic lows, such as oxbows and scour
pools are facies that typically accumulate large amounts of organic matter. Since
accumulation is essentially a discontinuous process, the concept of mean residence time
does not apply. In general, most buried floodplain sediments probably contain less
organic carbon than buried soils (cf. Haas, Holliday and Stuckenrath 1986:479), but the
potential for patchy concentrations of carbon is always present. In some cases, a
significant amount of authochthonous carbon may be present. At the Wilson-Leonard
site, Stafford (1998:1053-1054) argues the organic carbon in Unit I cienega muds is
derived mostly from aquatic plants growing in or on the mud.

For sediments, a principal source of error is the possibility that substantial
quantities of fossil carbon may be exposed by erosion upbasin and redeposited at the site
of interest (Fowler, Gillespie and Hedges 1986:442). Fossil carbon could include older
charcoal or other relatively inert humic substances exhumed from fossil soils. According
to Abbott,
The major assumption that must be made in dating sediments is that the organic
material is penecontemporaneous and can provide a good estimate of the sediment
age… if the organics have previously been in storage elsewhere (e.g.,
accumulating for thousands of years as an upland soil that is then converted to an
organic sediment by erosion) then the estimate provided can be significantly older
than the age of deposition (Abbott 1996:155).

768

In the case of Berger Bluff, an additional possible source of error is fossil carbon
in the form of phreatic carbonate and radiocarbon derived from groundwater. The
carbonate is redeposited from the Miocene-aged Goliad Formation bedrock and should
show no radiocarbon activity. Carbonate should be removed by sample pretreatment, but
some of the carbonate cement is very resistant to acid digestion. Groundwater in other
southern Plains aquifers typically shows radiocarbon activity with time lags of several
centuries to millennia. If the sediment contains significant amounts of autochthonous
organic matter that has grown on-site and has incorporated dead carbon, there can also be
a “reservoir” or “hard-water” effect that will not be removed in sample pretreatment
(Fowler, Gillespie and Hedges 1986:446-447; Stafford 1998:1052). Because only one of
the humin samples (GX-17035-II) seems somewhat anomalously old, neither fossil
carbon nor reservoir effects appear to be the major source of error in the sediment dates.

Regardless of whether soils or sediments are sampled, organic matter is usually
treated as three separate fractions. These are complex compounds that are defined not by
their composition, but by the lab methods used to extract them. These are:
Fulvic acid (soluble in alkali, soluble in acid)
Humic acid (soluble in alkali, insoluble in acid)
Humin (insoluble in alkali, insoluble in acid)
From top to bottom, these three fractions generally have progressively greater
molecular weight, carbon content, and resemblance to lignin (Swift 1985:Fig. 1), and in
some cases, progressively older radiocarbon ages. However, there is little consistency in
the relative ages of these three fractions (Martin and Johnson 1995:233; Shore, Bartley
and Harkness 1995). In some cases, fulvic acid is youngest and humic acid is oldest
769

(Campbell 1967:Table 1). In some cases, the humin fraction is older than the humic acid
fraction (Walker et al. 2001) and in others, the humic acid fraction is often older than the
humin fraction (four out of five cases in Haas, Holliday and Stuckenrath 1986:Table 3).
At the Wilson-Leonard site, the humic acid fraction was consistently older than either the
humin fraction or bulk decalicified sediment (Stafford 1998:Fig. 25-7). In the study by
Walker and others, fossil pond sediments were assayed and in 15 out of 17 cases, the
humin fraction was older than the humic acid fraction (by an average of about 440
radiocarbon years; Walker et al. 2001:Table 1).

There are relatively few studies that compare bulk or fractionated sediment or soil
organic matter to charcoal from the same

soil horizon or layer. When five paired

charcoal-humate assays from Late Holocene contexts at Fort Hood were run, the “bulk
humate” samples consistently dated 401-1317 radiocarbon years older, and the MRT for
the humate samples appeared to increase with depth (Quigg and Ellis 1994:Table 8.20).
A study from Brazil found that humin assays were roughly equivalent to charcoal in six
cases, younger in nine cases, and older in two cases (Pessenda, Gouveia and Aravena
2001:Table 3).

SEDIMENT ASSAYS FROM THE BENCH DEPOSITS
In the case of Berger Bluff, analysis of both the humic acid and humin fractions
was requested for the first two sediment samples (GX-17034 and GX-17035) submitted
to Geochron Laboratories in 1991, but in both cases, insignificant amounts of humic
acids were extracted and no assays were possible for the humic acid fraction. Likewise,
for the two samples submitted in 1994 and analyzed by AMS (GX-18866-AMS and GX18867-AMS), only the humin fraction was analyzed. The unanalyzed humic acid
770

fractions were given the lab code suffix I and the humin fractions were given the suffix
II. Laboratory procedure is as follows:

The sample was disaggregated, dispersed in deionized water, then whatever
remained in suspension after “a few seconds” (telephone conversation with Hal
Krueger, July 22, 1994) was drawn off and treated with HCl until all carbonates
were removed. Clays and organic matter were separated from any sand and silt,
and washed free of excess acid. The sample was then digested in warm dilute
NaOH to dissolve humic acids. The supernatant solution was recovered and
acidified to precipitate humic acids for analysis. The material remaining after
humic acid extraction was washed free of NaOH, acidified, filtered, and dried.
The residual material was roasted in oxygen to combust any humins or other
resistant organic matter, and the carbon dioxide was recovered for analysis.

The sediment fraction analyzed, then, is a combination of silt and clay (<50
microns, according to Krueger). This procedure has worked well for samples with as little
as 0.01% carbon. The pretreatment does not use nitric acid. The NaOH wash is
substantial and normally more than adequate to remove humic acids; it does not get
exhausted and leave any humic acid residue (telephone conversation with Hal Krueger,
July 22, 1994).

Most of the organic carbon in the humin samples from the bench is probably
associated with the clay fraction, as organic carbon content is often positively correlated
with clay content (Quiroga, Buschiazzo and Peinemann 1996; Amelung et al. 1998).

It is already well-known that there is a particle size fractionation effect in soils,
and I would presume it fairly safe to assume that the same is true for sediments.
There are several references which back this up. The theory is that the fine
fractions (especially clays) hold interlayer clay-organic complexes, which are
presumed to have been present more or less since the time of soil
formation/original pedogenesis (i.e., the first humus formation). These
compounds (largely thought to be aliphatic in nature) are extremely stable and
771

recalcitrant, and once bound, are thought to be virtually inert to biological
alteration (Pete Falloon, personal communication 1997, Institute of Arable Crops
Research-Rothamsted, Hertfordshire, England).
Table 5.2 shows some data for a modern soil in Saskatchewan assayed by
Anderson and Paul (1984). The humic acids were extracted by an alkali-pyrophosphate
process that differs from the standard radiocarbon lab procedure. Humic acid A is the
alkaline pyrophosphate extract, and Humic acid B is the “humus=clay” extract. Table 5.2
shows that the radiocarbon age is proportional both to the organic carbon content and
(with the exception of the fine clay fraction) to the fineness of the sediment grade. The
coarse clay fraction has the oldest radiocarbon age. The authors offer no explanation for
why the fine clay grade is different, but note that electron microscopy shows the organic
matter in the coarse clay fraction includes many humified microbial cell walls.

Scharpenseel and Becker-Heidmann (1992:545 and Fig. 2) also find that zones
with the highest clay content also produce the oldest radiocarbon ages and conclude that
“clay organic complexes, once formed, do not easily exchange the organic component
with infiltrated younger humus components.” It seems likely that most of the organic
carbon in the bench samples was adsorbed to the edges of clay particles (Birkeland 1984;
Varadachari, Mondal and Ghosh 1995). Table 5.3 shows properties of the four humin
samples and suggests that the relationship proposed by Scharpenseel and BeckerHeidmann seems to apply fairly well. The oldest assay (GX-17035) comes from the most
clay-rich sample, the next oldest (GX-17034) from the second most clay-rich sample, and
the sample that probably has the least clay (GX-18866) has the youngest date, one that
appears far too recent for its stratigraphic position. Note that there are no grain-size data
from N111 E101, but clay content can be estimated from visual inspection of profiles and
from the magnetic susceptibility data. I suspect that the humin age is at least partly
controlled by the grain size of the sample. GX-17034 shows very good agreement with a
stratigraphically comparable charcoal sample (AA2831). GX-17035 is somewhat older
than expected, and the remaining two assays are younger than expected, especially GX18866, which is clearly far too recent.

DOCUMENTATION FOR INDIVIDUAL ASSAYS
The assays below are ordered by absolute elevation, from highest to lowest. Most
of the same information is presented in tabular form in Table 5.1. Note that all labs use
the Libby halflife, by international convention, but Beta Analytic and the University of
Texas Radiocarbon Lab interpret that as 5568 years, while Geochron interprets it as 5570
years. Calibrated dates are based on CALIB 4.4 (Stuiver and Reimer 1993), using the
INTCAL98 terrestrial database (Stuiver et al. 1998).

Provenience: N109.08 E96.70 (92.75 m)
When analyzed: 1988
Remarks: This charcoal was found adhering to the underside of a large rock that was part
of a scatter of rock and freshwater mussel valves in the upper levels of unit N109 E96
(Fig. 4.52). A composite drawing compiled from four different level plans can be seen in
Fig. 4.50 (top). This debris scatter is clearly cultural in origin, and the sample is clearly in
774

place, not displaced by bioturbation. The debris scatter may be associated with a small
rock cluster (see Fig. 3.1 for location) discovered in the corner of the area where
overburden was removed from the toeslope. Bone, snail shell, mussel shell fragments,
discolored sandstone fragments, hackberry seed fragments, and a chert flake fragment
were recovered from the two 5 cm excavation levels immediately above and below 92.75
m. In the Coleto Creek basin, the most likely species of juniper is probably eastern red
cedar, Juniperus viginiana (Espey, Huston & Associates 1976:Table 2-18), occurring
most often in upland settings, often as an invader species in disturbed habitats. It is
perhaps not common in riparian settings except in headwater reaches of streams. Another
possibility might be southern red cedar, Juniperus silicicola, more likely to be found in
riparian settings but not currently reported from the area. Date shows excellent agreement
with GX-17034-II. A δ 13C value of –25 ‰ is assumed, not measured.

and is also a humin sample; these two samples also do not overlap at 2 sigma.

Remarks: This is the first sample submitted from the site, in the summer of 1979,
collected June 26 while blufftop excavations were ongoing. The sample consists of small
bits of wood charcoal collected directly from the baked and oxidized surface of the
hearth, Feature 5, and the equivalent surface extending a few centimeters to the northeast.
Charcoal was intermixed with and closely associated with the extensive microfauna
deposit found on the hearth surface and extending to the east and southeast. Sample was
very small, assayed by conventional methods and counted three days (Sam Valastro,
personal communication), despite which the standard error is very large. This sample is
unquestionably in place, not displaced by bioturbation, and has the best cultural
associations of any from the site. It is directly associated not with any chert artifacts but
with the hearth and microfauna, both believed to be of cultural origin.

Provenience: Sample consists of three combined subsamples, two from excavation units
(plotted in situ) and one from the cutbank. Sample 10 (2.4131 g) is plotted at N112.98
E99.25 (92.16 m); sample 23 (0.4664 g) is plotted at N113.12 E98.77 (92.15-92.10 m,
most in situ at 92.13 but some ex situ in unit or screen); and sample 24 (0.1055 g) is from
the cutbank immediately north of unit N111 E101, elevation not recorded but directly
associated with mussel shell zone. Samples collected 12/11/79 and 4/17/80.
When analyzed: 1981
Previous publication: Valastro et al. (1988:246)
Remarks: In retrospect, this sample should never have been assayed. Submitted before
AMS dating became commercially available, it was an attempt to assemble enough
charcoal to date the widespread mussel shell-bearing surface in stratum 2A using
conventional analysis. The date obtained is far too recent (the most recent assay of the
entire series), most likely because of contamination from inclusion of the cutbank sample.
The date overlaps with AA 2830 at 1 sigma, but both are too recent. Even with three
combined subsamples, this sample was very small and was counted for 41.6 hours. All
three subsamples are closely associated with freshwater mussel shells.

Date seems slightly too old. Sample is from same excavation level as AA 2832 but does
not overlap with it, even at 2 sigma; sample is just above BETA 16979, but does not

SAMPLES SUBMITTED BUT NOT ANALYZED
In September, 1982, I combined three wood charcoal samples and submitted them
to Charles Tucek of Radiocarbon, Ltd., a radiocarbon laboratory operating at the time in
Lampasas, Texas for conventional assay. In November, Tucek reported that after
pretreatment insufficient carbon (less than 0.1 g) remained for assaying, and the attempt
was abandoned. In May, 1994, I again contacted Tucek to inquire if the combined sample
was still curated somewhere and might be available for AMS analysis, but Tucek
confirmed that the sample had been discarded.

The three samples that were combined are as follows:
Field sample number: 15
Provenience: N112 E99 (91.94 m)
Weight: 0.1417 g
Field sample number: 16 (Fig. 5.4)

EVALUATION OF THE ASSAYS
Archeological sites like Berger Bluff do not yield easily to absolute dating efforts.
Relatively slow depositional rates and active water tables can present major challenges
(see Jackson and Whitehead 1993 for discussion). A large sample of fixed cultural
features (hearths or pits) with associated wood charcoal clearly not moved about by
disturbance processes would provide the best data for absolute dating, but during the
early history of the site, it was obviously a low-density, limited-use site that was only
sporadically visited by short-term occupants, and there are not a great many cultural
features. There were evidently other hearths besides Feature 5 (as local informants attest),
but Feature 5 is the only one for which we have any data. It can be considered a “fixed
point” for chronometric purposes, and likewise the wood charcoal (AA 2831) associated
with the debris scatter in N109 E96 (stratum 2D) can also be considered a “fixed point.”
Neither of the two small pits (Features 6 and 7) uncovered in the excavations had directly
associated charcoal, although both had some small bits of wood charcoal in the nearby
vicinity.

Four sediment humin samples were analyzed in hopes that bulk sediment samples
would not be as susceptible to vertical displacement as small fragments of wood charcoal.
However, the effort seems largely unsuccessful because the sample age appears
substantially controlled by clay content.

Except for animal bone, mussel shell, and snail shell, the only other material
suitable for absolute dating consists of small bits of isolated wood charcoal. Besides AA
2831, already discussed, three of these samples (BETA 73471, AA 2830, and AA 2832)
789

come from light debris scatters that were mapped in place, and for this reason are not
considered likely to be fluvially transported fossil charcoal. The fourth (BETA 16979)
was not directly associated with any cultural debris.

Inspection of the assays (Table 5.1) shows that there are no wildly discrepant
dates – that is, there are no modern, late Holocene or middle Holocene dates – but there
are many inversions because there are 4-6 assays that are younger than expected and one
that is slightly older than expected. Figures 5.5 and 5.7 show all of the assays, in both
uncalibrated and calibrated form, plotted against absolute elevation in meters. Using a 1sigma standard error, the maximum range of the assays is 6960-12,350 RCYBP, but I
will argue that this can be narrowed. I believe the lack of post-early Holocene dates
supports my argument in Chapter 4 that bioturbation and vertical translocation of
sedimentary fines (or organic matter) ceased as soon as phreatic carbonate cementation
was well established.

Nevertheless, there is no consistent age-depth relationship (Figs. 5.5, 5.7). Some
of the assays can clearly be rejected on specific grounds. Tx 4095 should be rejected
because it probably incorporates a contaminated subsample. Both of the humin samples
(GX-18867 and GX-18866) assayed by AMS can be rejected as too young and chiefly
reflecting clay content. Possibly GX-17035 should also be rejected as too old and chiefly
reflecting clay content. The remaining humin sample (GX-17034) can perhaps be
retained because it shows good agreement with AA 2831.

798

One other sample, AA 2830, is problematical. There are no grounds to reject it on
the basis of provenience or composition (it consists of three tightly clustered subsamples
associated with a debris scatter at the upper contact of stratum 2A), but the calculated
date of 8460 ± 70 RCYBP is younger than any of the overlying samples. The subsamples
are in the same area of the unit as the tree mold that was first detected 30 cm deeper (Fig.
4.56), but no trace of it was detected at the 92.20 m level. This assay should probably be
rejected on the basis of conflict with stratigraphically higher assays, although the source
of error is unclear.

If GX-18866, GX-18867, GX-17035, Tx 4095, and AA 2830 are eliminated from
consideration, the remaining six assays can be seen in uncalibrated (Fig. 5.6) and
calibrated form (Fig. 5.8) distributed across the Preboreal, Younger Dryas, and Alleröd to
Bölling climatic periods, covering a span of about 3000 uncalibrated years or 4450
calendar years. However, it is unlikely that the true age of Tx 3569 extends into the preYounger Dryas period, and it is unlikely that the bench deposits required 4450 calendar
years to accumulate. Otherwise, there would have been more evidence of soil
development, even allowing for the degree of groundwater saturation in evidence.

My interpretation of the available but somewhat inconsistent radiocarbon data is
that the lowest part of the bench sediments visible during fieldwork dates to the Younger
Dryas, probably the early part of the Younger Dryas. However, the sediments below
91.28 m were not visible, and the maximum depth and age of the bench sediments are
unknown. The middle part of stratum 2D dates to the Preboreal period, based on AA
2831, but there are an additional 80 cm or so of bench sediments above that point
remaining undated because there are no assays above 92.75 m. The major environmental
799

change at the top of the bench remains undated, then, but a very rough plausible estimate
for the age of the stratum 3/stratum 4 contact would be about 8500 RCYBP, or midway
in the Boreal period, about 1500 years after the end of the Pleistocene.

Because both the upper and the lower part of the bench deposits lack radiocarbon
assays, and because the assays in the middle part show major inconsistencies, the
estimated age of the bench deposits at 8500-11,000 RCYBP is at best an informed guessdate. This estimate is consistent with the known archeological and biological evidence.
There is cultural debris from the deposits, but it is not chronologically or culturally
diagnostic. The vertebrate fauna contains one possible extinct species (giant tortoise) and
one or two taxa that are slightly extralimital. The snail fauna includes a few extirpated
taxa, including at least one taxon (Valvata tricarinata) that is a good Pleistocene marker
species.

POSSIBLE SOURCES OF ERROR IN CHARCOAL ASSAYS
Three assays on wood charcoal (AA2830, AA 2832, and BETA 16979) produced
dates that were somewhat younger than expected, based on stratigraphic position. There
are several possible sources of error for charcoal assays. Exhumed fossil charcoal and
carbonate contamination have already been mentioned, but these (as well as the “old
wood” problem) can be ruled out because they would tend to make the assay too old.
Because the principal error trend seems to be for assays to be younger than expected, the
most likely sources of error are probably unrecognized bioturbation and contamination by
organic acids not completely removed in pretreatment. Contamination by extraneous
carbon can occur during chemical processing of AMS samples (Mueller and Muzikar
2002).
800

Because AA 2830 was associated with a debris scatter, it was assumed to be in
place and not introduced from some higher stratigraphic level. Furthermore, if my
estimation of the age of the deposits is correct, it would have to have been displaced
downward well over a meter if bioturbation is to explain its anomalously recent date. To
a lesser degree, the same arguments apply to AA 2832. BETA 16979 is not directly
associated with a debris scatter, but is close to AA 2832 in location and age. All three of
these samples come from stratum 2A. The most likely source of error may be recent
organic acids that were not completely removed in pretreatment. Standard pretreatment
employed by radiocarbon labs uses an acid-alkali-acid (or “AAA”) pretreatment
consisting of an acid wash to remove carbonates, either an NaOH or KOH alkali bath to
remove humic acids, and a final alkali wash to remove absorbed atmospheric CO2. Goh
and Molloy (1979) carried out an extensive study of fulvic and humic acid contamination
in buried charcoal samples from New Zealand. They found that charcoal samples had
significant quantities of contaminants. The oxidizable organic carbon content of
archeological charcoal samples was widely variable (7.3 to 47.5%; Goh and Molloy
1979:Table 2). More humic acid than fulvic acid was found in the samples, and they also
found that samples of small pieces of charcoal tended to produce younger assays than
samples of large pieces, due to increased surface area and increased potential for
adsorption of contaminants [the opposite relationship was found by Blong and Gillespie
(1978)]. Alkali-pyrophosphate was found to be an effective pretreatment for removal of
these acids, more so than the standard NaOH or KOH pretreatment.

801

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS FOR CHAPTER 5
There are no radiocarbon assays from the uppermost 80 cm of bench deposits, or
from the lowest 60 cm of deposits that were visible during fieldwork, and the maximum
depth of the bench deposits is unknown. Eleven assays are available from the middle part
of the bench, but several of these (four in particular) are younger than expected, and there
are a number of stratigraphic inversions among them. Some assays may have suffered
incomplete removal of organic acids by alkali pretreatment. Only two charcoal assays are
so securely associated with fixed points (a fired surface or an extensive debris scatter)
that vertical displacement of the sample can be completely ruled out. Four different
radiocarbon labs, two different assayed substances (charcoal and sediment), and two
different assay methods (AMS and conventional beta counter) were used to produce the
assays, so it is not surprising that there are some differences between the assays.

For the bench sediments that were visible during fieldwork (a maximum thickness
of just over two meters), the most plausible age estimate is a Younger Dryas-Preboreal
age, or perhaps about 8500-11,000 RCYP, but with considerable uncertainly resulting
from inconsistencies among assays, as well as the lack of assays at the top and base of the
bench. Most of the preferred assays fall into the Late Paleoindian or Folsom time spans
(Fig. 5.9). The major environmental shift at the top of the bench remains undated, but
clearly lies in the early Holocene, based on AA 2831. A rough estimate of about 85009000 RCYBP seems plausible, based on that assay and consistent rates of sediment
accretion. Thereafter, Coleto Creek experienced a shift in depositional style, stratum 4
began to accumulate, and evidence of spring discharge diminished.
