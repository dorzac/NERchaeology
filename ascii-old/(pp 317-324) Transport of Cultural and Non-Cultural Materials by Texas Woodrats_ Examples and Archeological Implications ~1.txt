Transport Of Cultural And
NonoCuiturai Materials By
Texas Woodrats:
Examples And Archeological
Implications

Thomas R. Hester and T.C. Hill dr.

ABSTRACT
A study was conducted of modern woodrat (Neotoma micropus) houses located on or near
prehistoric open campsites in southern Texas. Structural components of the houses are
documented. Large, shallow basins are found beneath the houses, containing grass lined nests
and tunnels. The rodents often transport a variety of cultural and non-cultural materials into
these domiciles. Nature and type of the collected items are recorded. Possible archeological implications are discussed, particularly those which might lead to misinterpretation of artificially
created artifact and debris patterns.

INTRODUCTION
Archeologists have noted various mechanisms through which animals can
be responsible for the transport or movement of artifacts and other cultural
materials. Heizer (1968) documented a number of examples. Woodrats
(Neotoma sp.) are particularly well known for their ability to carry and move
artifacts and other large objects, with such items usually being taken to their
nests. This situation is a common phenomenon in Great Basin caves and
rockshelters, where a wooden artifact (such as a dart shaft or digging stick)
might be incorporated in the construction of a woodrat house (Heizer and
Krieger, 1956:10).
Heizer and Brooks (1965) presented data on the contents of packrat nests
found in California and the Great Basin to support their argument that the
features excavated at the Lewisville locality in northern Texas might be
burned woodrat houses and not Paleoindian hearths. There have been
detailed analyses of Pleistocene packrat nests and middens in various parts
of the American Southwest and adjacent desert areas (Finley, 1958; Raun,
1966; Wells and Jorgensen, 1964; Wells, 1966, 1976; Van Devender,
1974, 1976; Phillips and Van Devender, 1974; Riskind and Van Devender,
1979). The primary goal of these studies was paleoenvironmental research.
These studies often illustrated the potential for the transport of artifacts
(Finley, 1958) and other materials by woodrats (Riskind and Van
Devender, 1979:6). These materials sometimes are used as components in

house construction or they end up in the nest and tunnels beneath the
house. These data lead to a simple conclusion: the rodents can distort the
archeological record. Most field archeologists are familiar with the
stratigraphic problems that burrowing rodents can cause. However,
fieldworkers perhaps are less cognizant of the horizontal disturbances that
could result from woodrat activities.
Woodrats can disturb artifact patterning on living floors; or they can create
artificial features, i.e., clusters of artifacts or materials that might be interpreted as activity loci. Hester (1975) described an example of this kind of
phenomenon caused by roadrunners in southern Texas. Transporting activities might have a significant effect on interpretations of prehistoric
features and artifact patterning. Since the hunter-gatherer camp sites of the
region were repeatedly abandoned, there would have been ample opportunity for the rodents to collect and move cultural residues left behind by
seminomadic inhabitants.
Results obtained by the dissection of two large modern woodrat houses
found on the surface near prehistoric open camp sites in southern Texas are
described. Woodrats (Neotoma rnicropus, Southern Plains Woodrat) are
extremely common in the area (Raun, 1966) and their houses are
numerous. These houses sometimes occur on or near local prehistoric sites.
Faunal assemblages found in excavated sites in the area provide evidence of
the abundance of these rodents in prehistoric times (Hester and Hill, 1975).
They were present not only in the area but also were a favored staple in the
aboriginal diet.

WOODRAT HOUSES AND THEIR CONTENTS
Two woodrat houses along Tortugas Creek in Zavala County, southern
Texas, were dissected in 1971. These houses were located on, or adjacent
to, Late Prehistoric sites, including 41ZV14 and 41ZV155 (Hester and Hill,
1973, 1975; Hill and Hester, 1973). House components were documented
and nest contents within houses collected. Only general comments are
made about the houses and their construction; additional details for South
Texas woodrat houses are in Raun (1966) and Johnson (1966).
House #1 was located 150 yds east of Tortugas Creek in an open
floodplain microenvironment dominated by prickly pear (Opuntia lindheimeri) (Holdsworth, 1973). Site 41ZV14 is nearby (Hester and Hill,
1973). The house (outer shelter) appeared as a large accumulation of sticks
and brush. It was 6 ft long (east-west), 5 ft wide (north-south), and 22 in
high. It was built against an Opuntia sp. stump which served as a buttress to
the structure. Five entrances to the house were observed.
Major components recorded were: prickly pear (Opuntia sp.) leaves,
segments of the pitaya cactus (Echinocereus enneacanthus), many small
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) branches, mesquite bark, Iotebush branches
(Condalia sp.), huisache (Acacia farnesiana), Christmas cactus (Opuntia
leptocaulis), granjeno or hackberry (Celtis pallida), and guayacan (Porliera
angustifolia). Items used to fill areas on the house included cow dung and
dirt clods. Data were recorded for six sticks in order to illustrate the size of
some of the woody components of the house (Table 1). In total, nine bu of
materials were tallied as components of the house.

A large adult and two juvenile woodrats made their escape as demolition
of the house proceeded. Removal of the structure exposed a saucer shaped
depression in the earth, approximately two thirds the size of the house and 3
in deep in the central part. Burrows, consisting of tunnels and trenches
(some lined with grass), constituted the nesting areas.
House #2 (Fig. I) was also in the area of site 41ZV14, 300 yds east of
Tortugas Creek in a similar prickly pear zone. The house was 5.5 ft long
(north-south), 4.75 ft wide (east-west), 14 in high, and had eight entrance
holes. Like House #I, it was built against a bush or tree stump. The same
type of building components were observed; they filled 6.5 bu when removed. The longest stick used in construction was 43 in long. A sample of
sticks used in the building of the house was recorded (Table 2).
A large, shallow depression was noted beneath the house; within this
depression, two rooms (one a grass lined nest) were connected by four
trenches. Unlike House #1, this woodrat domicile was abandoned.
While only Houses #1 and #2 were totally dissected, casual observations
were made on several other woodrat houses that were either totally or partially dissected. Their components differed little from those described in
detail. However, the brief inspections allow additional generalizations.
Houses were built from whatever was immediately available in the vicinity.
Lanner and Van Devender (1974:207) observed that the home range of
woodrats is approximately 100 m (328 ft) in radius. However, Raun
(1966:23) observed that South Texas woodrats have a greater home range
of between 1,700-2,500 sq ft. These animals often move objects of considerable weight and size; sticks form the basic structure that is capped with
Opuntia sp. leaves, animal dung (cow, horse), and dirt clods.
This work was designed to obtain data on the kinds of items taken into the
nests by woodrats. Tabulation of the kinds of components used in building
the houses documents the capacity of these rodents to move large objects. It
also ascertains the variety of items collected from the area around the
houses and brought into the chambers and nests. Specific data are available
for Houses #1 and #2 (Table 3). Using the observations from the casual inspection of several other woodrat houses, Table 4 illust~ates some of the
diversity of items collected.
ARCHEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS
Distortion of the archeological record and misinterpretation of evidence
could result from woodrat activities. For instance, were House #I or #2 to
have been built in prehistoric times on the fringes of an aboriginal camp site
and then burned (either through natural causes or by aborigines), a 20th
Century archeological excavation might lead to their documentation as
cultural phenomena. The archeologist would find a shallow, basin shaped
depression, perhaps up to 4 ft in diameter and a few inches deep, containing some burned rocks, burned clay or dirt lumps, land snails, pebbles,
perhaps a chert flake (or even a tool), and a varied assortment of animal remains.
Paleobotanical, palynological, or phytolith analyses of the featureâs contents could reveal the presence of Opuntia sp. and pitaya cactus, hackberry
seeds, and other plant remains that would have been contained in animal
dung. An archeologist, working on or near the edge of a known prehistoric

site might infer a hearth function for such an occurrence.
The shape, size, and contents of such a house are not unlike aboriginal
hearths documented at South Texas hunter-gatherer sites (Hester and Hi!l,
1975; Montgomery, 1978). There is not a great abundance of woodrat
bones in the nests (remains resulting from natural deaths in the domicile).
The few charred woodrat bones found in the burned depression might indeed argue against it being a woodrat nest, i.e., they represent remains of
rodents cooked during an aboriginal meal.

Woodrat houses in South Texas prickly pear flats usually are clustered
(Holdsworth, 1973). A prairie or brush fire sweeping through the community could create a whole series of burned depressions (with the kinds of contents noted). This distribution could reinforce the archeologistâs inference
that these excavated features were not natural but camp fires of family units
in a hunter-gatherer band (cf. site plans of Bushmen open occupation sites;
Yellen, 1977).

Criteria for distinguishing between a burned woodrat nest and some types
of aboriginal cooking areas cannot be provided. In South Texas, the size,
contents, and density of materials is likely to be similar. Perhaps controlled
experimental burning of woodrat houses, followed after some time by
careful excavation, would serve to better define the situation in archeological terms.
Although field studies and speculative comments have dealt with modern
woodrat houses, these data may be compared to a controversial site like
Lewisville (Heizer and Brooks, 1965). The largest fire feature at Lewisville
(Hearth 1; Crook and Harris, 1957) is larger in plan than the modern
woodrat nests examined. However, some of the 21 fire features are approximately the same size as the substructural woodrat depressions noted.
Hearth 14 was 4.75 x 3.3 ft, hearth 15 was 5.8 x 3.5 ft, and hearth 16 was
4.5 x 2.6 ft; all were shallow, 3 to 8 in deep (Crook and Harris, 1957:34).
Their contents, and those of the other fire features, make interesting comparisons to the modern data presented. There are a variety of animals (turtle, deer, skunk, rabbit, mole) within the features, including woodrat remains in practically every one; there are also pieces of sandstone, snails,
and charcoal (cf. House #1) (Crook and Harris, 1957).
Archeologists working in areas where woodrat houses occur on or near
open occupation sites, as in Texas and other parts of the western United
States, should be aware of the potential for misinterpretation of subsurface
burned features. Additionally, prehistoric woodrat houses that deteriorated
and decayed through natural processes could conceivably have created artificial clusters of animal bone, burned rocks, and even lithics which might be
seen by the excavator as an activity area. The selective sampling habits of
these rodents could have caused some disarray in fragile aboriginal activity
patterns on abandoned camp sites by the moving of lithics, bones, and other
items from the camp sites to their nests.
