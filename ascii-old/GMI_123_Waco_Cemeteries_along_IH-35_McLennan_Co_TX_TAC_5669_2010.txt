Project Description and Impacts: The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing to widen IH 35 from
four to six lanes for 94 miles between the Williamson County line and the intersection of IH 35 E and W just north of
Hillsboro. As part of the project, TxDOT will construct continuous IH 35 frontage roads to reduce the number of vehicles
on the main lanes of IH 35 and allow traffic to be redirected when needed. Of the six sections within this expansion
corridor, Section Four stretches through Waco, from South Loop 340 to North 340. TxDOT has identified two locations
within Section Four where there is potential to encounter unmarked graves in areas to be impacted by the road widening
and associated frontage road extensions (Figure 1). Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), was contracted by TxDOT under Contract
number 57-9XXSA005 to conduct an intensive archeological survey with mechanical trenching within the IH 35 existing
and proposed right-of-way (ROW) on the Fort Fisher Ranger Museum property adjacent to First Street Cemetery (Area 1)
and the General Assembly of the Living God property next to Greenwood Cemetery (Area 2) in Waco, McLennan County,
Texas. Duane Peter served as Principal Investigator.
Area of Potential Effects (APE): Project Area 1 consists of a grassy median strip (approximately 15 feet [ft] wide)
located between the existing IH 35 Frontage Road and the private drive for the Fort Fisher Ranger Museum (Figure 2a).
This area extends approximately 290 meters (m) from the Brazos River south to University Parks Drive. The
southwestern corner of the current boundary of First Street Cemetery is located approximately 25 m from the
southernmost portion of Area 1. To the north of this, the cemetery boundary becomes progressively more distant from
Area 1. Project Area 2 consists of a 45-ft-wide strip of land directly east of the IH 35 Frontage Road extending
approximately 190 m between Earle and Oak streets (Figure 2b). The current western boundary of Greenwood Cemetery
is approximately 200 m from Area 2. The precise depth of impacts is currently not known; however, it is estimated on
worst-case scenario basis that maximum depth of impacts should not exceed 6 feet below the existing ground surface.
Parcel #: N/A
Project Area Ownership: Project Area 1 consists entirely of state-owned ROW. In Area 2, the proposed widening and
frontage road extensions would extend into private property owned by Stephen Garner. Mr. Garner provided right-of-entry
(ROE) access for the archeological investigations.

Project Setting
Topography: Both project areas fall in an urban setting within the Brazos River Valley and are located within the rolling to
nearly level plains of the Blackland Prairie Ecoregion. Both project areas are located within the fossil floodplain of the
Brazos River. Elevations in Area 1 range from approximately 390 to 400 feet above sea level (asl), and the elevation
across the entirety of Area 2 is approximately 412 asl.
Geology: The underlying geology for the project areas consists of the Quaternary (Pleistocene) Fluviatile terrace deposits
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1970).
1

Soils: According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS 2010), two soil map units are present within the
Fort Fisher Ranger Museum project area (Area 1): Weswood silt loam, rarely flooded and Yahola loam, rarely flooded.
The Weswood series consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy
alluvium and are classified as fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic, Udifluventic Haplusteps. The Yahola series consists
of very deep, well-drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy alluvium of Permian and
Pleistocene age and are classified as coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, thermic, Udic Ustifluvents.
The Bastsil-Urban land complex, 0 to 2 percent slopes is mapped across the entirety of Area 2. The Bastsil consists of
very deep, well-drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments. These nearly level to gently
sloping soils are on stream terraces with slopes ranging from 0 to 5 percent and are classified as fine-loamy, siliceous,
active, thermic Udic Paleustalfs.
Land Use: Both project areas fall within a predominately urbanized region within the city of Waco. The land use in Area 1
consists of a well-manicured grassy median maintained by the Fort Fisher Ranger Museum, while the land use in Area 2
currently consists of an uninhabited open field with prairie grasses and forbs. Remnants of a previously standing structure
within the Area 2 indicate that the land was once used for residential/commercial purposes.
Vegetation: The vegetation in Area 1 consists of well-manicured Bermuda grass and several scattered oaks trees and
crape myrtles. Area 2 consists entirely of unkempt prairie grasses and forbs.
Estimated Ground Surface Visibility: 20-25%
Previous Investigations and Known Archeological Sites: Prior to beginning fieldwork, the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas was consulted to determine if any previously recorded cultural properties or cultural resources management (CRM)
projects have occurred within a 1-kilometer (km; 0.6-mile [mi]) radius of the project area. The review indicated that four
previously recorded archeological sites have been documented and five previous CRM projects have occurred within 1
km of Area 1 (see Figure 1); however, no sites or projects have been recorded within 1 km of Area 2.
The four archeological sites recorded within 1 km of Area 1 are 41ML94, 41ML203, 41ML238, and 41ML296; however,
none of the sites overlap with the current project area. Site 41ML94 is a multicomponent site consisting of deposits
associated with a nineteenth-century structure, an unknown prehistoric deposit (contents unspecified), and a small dump
associated with the Waco Suspension Bridge. The site’s eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) or designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) is unclear. Site 41ML203 represents the remains of the
Eureka Gas Light Works, an early industrial plant in use from 1874 until the early twentieth century. The site was
recorded during a survey for the proposed Brazos Commons Project (Jackson 1985) and has been recommended for
inclusion in the NHRP and for designation as an SAL.
Site 41ML238, originally recorded by Albert J. Redder in 1995, constitutes a multicomponent historic dump site located on
the southern bank of the Brazos River adjacent to the Fort Fisher Ranger Museum. The dump materials encountered at
41ML238 were deposited during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when the southern bank of the Brazos
River was used as a dump for the city of Waco. Accounts also indicate that debris from the 1953 tornado that struck the
downtown Waco district was deposited on the southern river bank. In 2006, TRC Environmental Corporation excavated
11 backhoe trenches along a proposed 1.6-km extension of the Brazos Riverwalk (Quigg and Matchen 2006). Historic
debris associated with 41ML238 was encountered in six of the 11 trenches. Two trenches encountered burned trash
deposits from the old Waco city dump that included materials dating from the late 1800s to the 1920s, and four trenches
encountered materials likely associated with the 1953 Waco tornado. No intact alluvial deposits were identified in any of
the six trenches, which were dug to 1.5 m in depth. During additional work for the proposed extension of the Brazos
Riverwalk, Prewitt and Associates, Inc., excavated seven trackhoe trenches (Griffith and Boyd 2008) slightly to the west of
the survey conducted by TRC Environmental Corporation. Historic trash deposits were found to 5 m below the surface in
all seven trenches. An additional archeological survey of the proposed expansion project for the Fort Fisher Ranger
Museum was conducted by American Archaeology Group, LLC, in October 2006 (Bradle et al. 2006). During this project,
portions of 41ML203 were scraped with a grader and backhoe to ensure that no unmarked graves associated with First
Street Cemetery, located immediately south of the proposed expansion area, were present in the areas to be impacted.
The survey found evidence that human graves had been present in the area, but no graves were found. Only materials
associated with the historic dumping were encountered during the process. Griffith and Boyd (2008), Quigg and Matchen
(2006), and Bradle et al. (2006) each recommended that the site was not eligible for inclusion in the NHRP or for
designation as an SAL. Lastly, PBS&J is currently conducting investigations at the Fort Fisher Ranger Museum involving
burial relocations under Texas Antiquities Permit 4878. No further information was available regarding this ongoing
investigation.

Site 41ML296 was identified by PBS&J in 2008 during archeological monitoring at the Fort Fisher Ranger Museum (Loftus
2008). To determine the eligibility status of the site, three 1-x-1- m units were excavated. The excavations recovered
remnants of a twentieth-century neighborhood consisting of three wells, a foundation, and numerous glass, ceramic, brick,
metal, faunal, and personal artifacts. Two of the three wells were mortared and were likely used as dump sites during the
mid-twentieth century. The dump sites were interpreted as being associated with the 1953 tornado and an urban renewal
project conducted in the 1960s. According to the evidence recovered, the structure appeared to have been burned and
razed and was determined to be heavily disturbed as a result. The site’s eligibility status is unknown.
Comments on Project Setting: The potential for finding intact unmarked burials within Area 1 is considered moderate to
high due the close proximity of the project area to marked graves (within 25 m of the southernmost project area). The
potential for finding burials decreases towards the northern end of Area 1 as the cemetery boundary becomes
progressively more distant from the project area boundaries. Because Greenwood Cemetery is approximately 200 m
from the Area 2 project area, the probability for finding unmarked graves within Area 2 is considered low. However, the
apparent previous land use of Area 2 as a residential/commercial neighborhood increases the potential for identifying
shallow, intact historic deposits.

Comments on Methods: Prior to execution of this project, project personnel consulted with Mr. Mark Denton of the State
Historic Preservation Office regarding the proposed field methodology. The placement, size, and depth of the proposed
trenches were decided. Mr. Denton was also advised of any major changes to the approach as the work was being
conducted.
Archeological field excavations and archival research were conducted for this project. Historical maps of the area were
examined to trace the use of the properties over time. These maps consisted of Sanborn Fire Insurance maps from the
early 1900s through 1950 and bird’s-eye-view maps from the late 1800s (Library of Congress, Geography and Map
Division 1892). Sanborn maps, which depict roads and footprints of individual structures, can demonstrate changes in a
specific area over time, and bird’s-eye-views show street patterns, individual buildings, and major landscape features from
an oblique angle.
Standard GMI procedure for locating unmarked burials consists of incrementally scraping an area, often in a series of
trenches, with a bladed machine such as a Gradall, which possesses a wide, toothless bucket that can be retracted
smoothly to provide maximum visibility of the exposed surface. A professional cemetery specialist experienced in
identifying human burials and knowledgeable about historic cemeteries and burial practices directs all activities and
determines placement, size, and depth of the areas to be excavated. During these investigations, the ground is gradually
scraped until either burials are encountered or the cemetery specialist is confident that no burials are present. Historic
burials are typically identified by the presence of a stain, usually rectangular in shape that differs in color from the
surrounding soil due to the mixing of different layers of soil when the grave is backfilled. Trench depth varies according to
the characteristics of the soils within the project area, the amount and degree of soil disturbance, and the depth of any
identified burials. In general, trenches are excavated to at least 8 ft (2.44 m) below the undisturbed solum to ensure that
no burials are present. The length, width, and depth of all trenches are recorded. Entrance into the trenches occurs only
if potential funerary artifacts, human remains, or evidence of a grave shaft are noted and only if the trench situation meets
current Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) safety standards. If the trench is more than 4 ft in depth,
the adjacent area will be benched to a depth of 4 ft to ensure that the slope is no more than 1:1. These trenches and any
3

associated archeological features (including burials) are photographed and mapped in relation to the project area and
surroundings using a tape measure and compass. Soil profiles of representative trench walls are also documented. All
trenches, including those containing burials, are backfilled by the end of the workday. The locations of any burial features
are recorded with a Trimble global positioning system (GPS) device and marked with a rebar pin embedded into the
ground surface. All graves remain in place unless a decision is made to remove them.
For the present project, four Gradall trenches were excavated adjacent to the Fort Fisher Ranger Museum (Area 1), and
four Gradall trenches were excavated within the ROW near the Greenwood Cemetery (Area 2). Trenches were
approximately 20 ft long and 6 ft wide in Area 1 and 20 ft long and 5 ft wide in Area 2. The proposed depth of trenches in
each area was to reach 8 ft below the undisturbed solum; however, the excavations of each of the four trenches in Area 1
were terminated prior to reaching the proposed depth due to contact with very calcareous sterile clay (Btk-horizons). This
decision was made on the basis that disturbances from burials would have been clearly detectable in this layer as stains
resulting from mixing the darker upper layers into this stratum. Once the trench profile was examined and photographed,
trenches were mechanically filled in and compacted as well as possible. To minimize damage to the Fort Fisher Ranger
Museum property, a front-end loader with rubber tires was used to backfill trenches within Area 1, but the Gradall was
used to backfill trenches within Area 2. All trenches (Areas 1 and 2) were excavated along a roughly northeast-tosouthwest axis generally paralleling the IH 35 Frontage Road. Trenching was conducted in conjunction with Texas
Historical Commission (THC) standards.

Survey Results
History and Development of the City of Waco
This section provides an overview of the history and development of the city of Waco and Areas 1 and 2. Contextual
information was obtained through the review of historic maps, topographic maps, and aerial photographs; local historic
accounts obtained from secondary literary sources and on-line resources.
The History of Waco
The city of Waco, Texas, located in central McLennan County, received its name from the Native American group the
Waco. Prior to European American settlement the Waco had established an agricultural village on the Brazos River in the
location of the present city of Waco, but were driven from their land in approximately 1830 by the Cherokee. Soon after in
1837, the first European American settlement in the area, Fort Fisher, was established on the Waco village site by the
Texas Rangers. The fort was abandoned a few months later because it was located too far to the west to provide
adequate protection to settlers. Due to the limited military protection in the area, settlement remained slow and difficult.
In 1844, an Indian trading post was established 8 miles south of the original Waco village, and one year later a second
settlement was established farther north by Neil McLennan, the settler for whom the county was named. After Texas
statehood in 1845, settlement of the area increased rapidly (Handbook of Texas Online 2010a).
Land development of the area that would become the city of Waco began in 1848, when Thomas J. Chambers sold a twoleague land grant on the south bank of the Brazos River to a group of businessmen from Galveston. Sale of the land was
appointed to Jacob De Cordova, a successful land agent from Galveston, who tasked surveyor George B. Erath with
dividing the land for sale. By 1849, Erath had laid out the first block of numbered lots and sold them for $5 each
(Handbook of Texas Online 2010a). The land on the north bank of the Brazos River across from the Chambers land grant
was located on the Tomas De La Vega land grant. The De La Vega land grant was at this time the focus of a legal
dispute regarding ownership. The land dispute was in litigation for nearly 20 years, and due to the lengthy legal battle, the
land on the north bank of the Brazos River was slow to develop (Conger 1958:372) (Figures 3 and 4).
As land on the south bank of the Brazos River opened for settlement, the area began to populate quickly. In 1850,
McLennan County was officially established and Waco village was chosen as the county seat. The original boundary
lines for the county extended as far north as Stephens and Palo Pinto counties; however, when Bosque County was
established in 1854, McLennan County was reduced to its present size (Figures 5 and 6). Between 1850 and 1860, the
population of Waco had grown to 2,000, and the flourishing frontier settlement was developing into a stable community. It
was during this time that several churches were established, the first newspaper, the Waco Era, was published, and the
village of Waco was reincorporated as the town of Waco (Bradle et al. 2006:19).
The rapid growth occurring in Waco during the late 1850s is attributed primarily to the spread of the cotton culture along
the Brazos River. With Waco’s economy heavily dependent on the plantation system, a majority of the town’s most
prominent citizens favored the southern secessionists during the Civil War and voted to join the state of Texas in
secession from the United States. No battles took place in Waco; however, 17 companies of Confederate soldiers were
raised from the Waco area. During the war, Waco produced cotton cloth for the Confederate army at Barron’s Mill and
Earle Brothers Mill. Although the production of cotton cloth helped to stimulate the town’s economy, the depleted
workforce, combined with racial conflicts arising from the emancipation of slaves, took its toll on the town. By the war’s
end, Waco’s economy was severely weakened (Bradle et al. 2006:19; Handbook of Texas 2010b).
4

After the war, the town of Waco found itself at the spur of the Chisholm Trail, allowing the town to recover quickly.
Cattlemen driving steers to Kansas used the town to replenish supplies and for recreational purposes such as drinking,
gambling, and prostitution (Bradle et al. 2006:19). Furthering Waco’s growth was the construction of a suspension bridge
spanning the Brazos River in 1871 and the arrival of the Northwestern Railroad in 1872. With improved access to and
from the town, Waco became an important shipping point for a broad area. Following the construction of the suspension
bridge, the town of Waco was reincorporated as the city of Waco (Handbook of Texas Online 2010a).
By 1880, cotton had once again become the leading agricultural product contributing to the economic stability of the city.
Also during this time, the St. Louis and Southwestern and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad lines were extended into
Waco, making the city a hub for the transport of goods, including cotton. The cotton industry was so vibrant that by 1890
the city was one of the most important cotton markets in the South, so much so, that several cotton agents moved their
offices to the city’s square. By 1900, Waco’s population had grown to 20,686, making it the sixth largest population center
in Texas (Handbook of Texas Online 2010a).
During the late 1800s and early 1900s, the city of Waco continued to expand and develop, which attracted a number of
educational institutions. Baylor University moved to Waco from Independence, Texas, in 1887 and merged with Waco
University. Other institutions of higher learning in the city included the Paul Quinn College (1872), Sacred Heart Academy
(1873), and Texas Christian University (1902). Due to the development of these and other educational institutions, Waco
became known as the “Athens of Texas.” Other culturally significant additions to the city included the opening of the Fall
Exposition in 1894 and the construction of the 20-story Amicable Insurance Building in 1911. The Fall Exposition became
one of the most welcomed fairs in the South, and the Amicable Insurance Building was known for being the tallest building
in Texas at the time (Bradle et al. 2006:21–22).
Although Waco had experienced tremendous growth since the end of the Civil War, the onset of the Great Depression
destabilized the city’s prosperity. Like so many cities throughout the United States, Waco began experiencing high
unemployment rates, a drop in agricultural prices, and the closing of businesses. Federal New Deal Programs assisted in
the city’s recovery and included Works Progress Administration projects and a National Youth Administration training
program set up at Baylor University (Bradle et al. 2006:22; Handbook of Texas 2010a). However, it was not until the start
of World War II that the city’s economy was truly reinvigorated. The war created a high demand for cotton and cotton
products, which helped to create a canvas industry in the city. Soon, Waco became the military’s leading producer of
cots, tents, mattresses, and barracks bags. Also during the war, the Waco Army Flying School, located approximately 8
miles north of the city, was established. The combination of wartime industries and the influx of military families increased
the population and restabilized the city’s economy (Handbook of Texas Online 2010a).
After the war, the military installations in the area were closed, but this did not hinder the city’s growth. In 1952, Waco had
a population of 84,300 and 250 factories producing an array of goods such as cotton products, tires, glass, furniture,
sporting goods, caskets, dry-cleaning equipment, and much more. However, in 1953, a devastating tornado swept
through the city killing 114 people, destroying 196 buildings in the city center, and severely damaging an additional 396
buildings. The devastation caused by the tornado forced the population to begin moving away from the city center into
suburban areas around the city (Handbook of Texas Online 2010a).
Beginning in 1958, an Urban Renewal Project was adopted by the city to help revitalize its urban center. This effort was
amplified when Waco was chosen to participate in the federal government “Model Cities” program in 1967. The Model
Cities program was an element of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s “War on Poverty,” but ultimately the program was not a
success. However, the Urban Renewal Project did help to generate over $125 million for renovation of the city, but the
program was stalled by the recession of the 1980s. Nevertheless, the city continued to work toward revitalizing its urban
core, the result of which was the construction of new apartments, shopping centers, and a convention center.
Additionally, the city established a zoo at Cameron Park and opened the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame and Museum at
Fort Fisher and the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. By 1990, the city population was 103,216, and as a whole, Waco had
experienced a significant amount of redevelopment (Handbook of Texas Online 2010a).
Land Development of Fort Fisher Ranger Museum (Area 1)
The Fort Fisher Ranger Museum property adjacent to First Street Cemetery (Area 1) is located on the Thomas J.
Chambers land grant, south and west of the Brazos River. This area developed in conjunction with the city, as it is
located on the original city lots distributed by George B. Erath. The First Street Cemetery adjacent to Area 1 is composed
of three contiguous cemeteries: City Cemetery, Masonic Cemetery, and International Order of Odd Fellows Cemetery.
The cemetery was established in 1852 and expanded to twice its original size in 1882 (Waco Convention and Visitor
Bureau 2010). A comparison of the 1926 and 1950 Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps (Digital Sanborn Maps 1952) shows
that the area surrounding the cemetery remained primarily domestic. However, in overlaying the 1926 and 1950 maps on
a 2010 aerial photograph, it becomes apparent that the area around the cemetery has drastically changed. The 2010
aerial shows that the construction of IH 35 northwest of Area 1 has drastically altered the road configuration and changed
the property types directly adjacent to the cemetery from primarily domestic or undeveloped to commercial (Figures 7 and
8).
5

Land Development of General Assembly of the Living God Property (Area 2)
The General Assembly of the Living God property next to Greenwood Cemetery (Area 2) is located on the Tomas De La
Vega land grant north and east of the Brazos River. The De La Vega land grant was subject to a lengthy legal dispute
regarding ownership and was therefore not developed as quickly as the land on the south bank of the river. Due to the
confusion of ownership, the land was first occupied by squatters; however, in 1872 the matter was resolved and the land
was sold and distributed (Conger 1958:381). The 1899 Sanborn Fire Insurance Index Map shows that a small portion of
land on the north bank is considered to be within the city limits (Figure 9). Area 2 and Greenwood Cemetery are located
farther northeast than the boundaries shown on the map. However, Greenwood Cemetery was established in 1875 and
accommodated equally both the African American and European American communities (Waco Convention and Visitor
Bureau 2010).
The first time Area 2 appears within the city boundaries is on the 1926 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map; however, Greenwood
Cemetery remains outside the city limits. The 1926 map shows Area 2 located east of La Vega Street (now Church
Street) with only one dwelling on a mostly undeveloped parcel. On the 1950 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map, the
undeveloped parcel is intersected by Oak Avenue and Lapsly Street and further developed with the addition of a vacant
wood truss structure and several dwellings located on the northwest and southeast ends of what was the original parcel.
A comparison of the 1926 and 1950 Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps with a 2010 aerial photograph shows that the
construction of IH 35 and its frontage road have altered the original configuration of the roads west of Area 2, and the
dwelling and vacant wood truss structures are no longer present (Figures 10 and 11).
Project Area Description:
RESULTS - AREA 1
Four Gradall trenches (Trenches 1–4) were excavated within Area 1 (see Figure 2a; see Table 1). A fifth trench at the
northernmost end of Area 1 was proposed in the scope of work submitted to and approved by the Texas Historical
Commission; however, excavation of this trench was abandoned due to the presence of a buried storm sewer line (see
Figure 2a). The four trenches were excavated between 40 and 60 m apart and were spaced relatively evenly throughout
the area. No evidence of burials was noted in any of the four trenches excavated within Area 1.
Trench 1 was excavated at the southernmost end of Area 1. The upper portion of the trench profile consisted of a topsoil
extending 15 centimeters below surface (cmbs) underlain by a layer of fill extending between 15 and 60 cmbs. The fill
was identified by the presence of a very dark brown (10YR 3/2) matrix with distinct strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) and very
pale brown (10YR 7/3) mottles containing many medium-sized gravels, asphalt, and bottle glass fragments. The top of
the natural surface was encountered at 60 cmbs and was represented by a brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy clay with very dark
brown (10YR 3/2) mottles containing few medium-sized gravels and few medium carbonate masses. The presence of this
Btk-horizon without an overlying A-horizon indicates that the original surface horizon was likely truncated at some point
prior to or during fill placement, likely in association with the construction and maintenance of IH 35 and the Frontage
Road. An intrusive trough-shaped feature was observed in the west wall profile of the trench (Plate 1) between 90 and
120 cmbs within the Btk-horizon. Upon closer inspection, the deposits within and adjacent to the trough were found to
contain several temporally nondiagnostic materials including an iron rebar fragment, several pieces of rusted metal,
several yellow brick fragments, one clear bottle glass sherd, and one blue glass sherd. No evidence of graves or grave
hardware was encountered within or adjacent to the feature. Due to its trough shape and isolated nature with no evidence
of its presence within the east wall profile, the intrusive feature is interpreted as representing a remnant drainage ditch or
trash pit. Below the trough were two more densely compacted Btk-horizons extending to 240 cmbs. Excavation of
Trench 1 ceased at this point because no indications of burials or other cultural features were encountered in the
unaltered natural clay substrata.
Trench 2 was excavated approximately 40 m northeast of Trench 1 and revealed a profile markedly different from that of
Trench 1 (Plate 2). Below the 15 cm of topsoil were several layers of sand, sandy loam, and clay fill extending to 110
cmbs. Several of the fill layers contained glass, asphalt, and stream gravels, and the deepest layer of fill contained large
fragments of concrete. A PVC pipe for an abandoned sprinkler system found at 60 cmbs near the edge of the Frontage
Road caused the trench to be shifted slightly to the east to avoid the line. The top of the natural surface, represented by a
dark brown (10YR 3/3) sandy loam A-horizon, was encountered directly below this at approximately 110 cmbs. This
horizon appeared to be level with the current ground surface of the adjacent First Street Cemetery. A single fragment of
wood was observed in the east wall within this A-horizon; however, the wood was determined to be an isolated find as no
other artifacts, stains, or other features were found in association. Compact subsoil (a Bt-horizon) consisting of a dark
brown (7.5YR 3/4) sandy clay contacted immediately below faded into a calcareous subsoil stratum (a Btk-horizon)
between 170 and 210 cmbs. Again, no evidence of disturbance indicative of burials was observed within 1 m below the
onset of sterile clay subsoil. As a result, excavation was again terminated prior to reaching the proposed excavation
depth.
6

Trench 3 was excavated approximately 60 m northeast of Trench 2 and exhibited a profile similar to that of Trench 2
(Plate 3). A thin sandy topsoil layer (0–10 cmbs) was followed by a series of fill layers to a depth of 100 cmbs. The top of
the natural surface directly below this consisted of a dark brown (10YR 3/3) sandy loam A-horizon with weak dark brown
(7.5YR 3/2) mottles and very few stream gravels. This horizon was underlain by a series of sandy clay subsoil horizons
between 155 and 300 cmbs that became increasingly more calcareous with depth. The lowest horizon, a Btk-horizon,
consisted of a brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy clay with prominent light gray (10YR 7/2) mottles with few small stream
gravels and few small snail shells. Excavation ceased at this point because no features were observed in the subsoil.
Finally, Trench 4 was excavated approximately 60 m northeast of Trench 3. The upper portion of the profile consisted of
a 5-cm-thick A-horizon of very dark brown (10YR 2/2) sand underlain by two distinct layers of fill (Plate 4). The uppermost
layer of fill between 5 and 40 cmbs consisted of a brown (7.5YR 4/3) sandy loam with light brownish gray (10YR 6/2)
inclusions with few gravels. This layer was underlain by a second fill layer consisting of an extremely compact light gray
(10YR 7/3) clay intermixed with gravel, cobble, and boulder-sized fragments of shale and concrete. This layer extended
to 208 cmbs until two 7-cm-thick slabs of concrete roadway were revealed running perpendicular to the long axis of the
trench in a roughly east–west orientation (Plate 5). A review of an 1892 bird’s-eye-view map (Library of Congress,
Geography and Map Division 1892) indicates that the buried road found in the trench likely represents remnants of River
Street, which once ran east–west across the approximate location of Trench 4. The 1950 Sanborn Insurance Map of
Waco also shows River Street at this location. Between the two road slabs, a 2.8-m-wide gap with intact sediments was
encountered. The trench was excavated within this gap to a total depth of 426 cmbs. The sediments encountered at this
depth consisted of a very dark brown (10YR 2/2) sandy loam A-horizon underlain by alternating layers of culturally sterile
fine and coarse sandy alluvium (Plate 6). This layer is consistent with a sequence of thinly stratified C-horizons formed in
loamy alluvium of Permian and Pleistocene age as described in the Yahola official series description. The narrowness of
the gap between the two road slabs prevented deeper excavation below approximately 426 cmbs.
RESULTS - AREA 2
Four Gradall trenches (Trenches 1–4) were excavated in Area 2 (see Figure 2b; see Table 1). Unlike the trenches
excavated in Area 1, all of the trenches excavated in Area 2 demonstrated a relatively intact natural solum and none
encountered surface fill. The four trenches were excavated 40–50 m apart and were spaced relatively evenly throughout
the area. No evidence of burials was noted in any of the four trenches excavated within Area 2. Trench 1 represents the
southernmost trench excavated in Area 2. The profile of the trench (Plate 7) consisted of a thick, brown (10YR 4/3)
coarse sand A-horizon between 0 and 50 cmbs underlain by a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) coarse sand E-horizon
between 50 and 90 cmbs. Both horizons contained numerous rodent burrows with sediments from each horizon clearly
mixed into the other (Plate 8). Below this, alluvial parent material had been altered through time by increases in clay
content and an increased expression of manganese nodules with depth until approximately 200 cmbs. Between 200 and
240 cmbs, clay content still increased but manganese nodules were absent. No cultural materials or evidence of burials
were observed.
Trench 2 was excavated just north of a small (8-x-6 m) grass-and-weed-covered mound of broken concrete slabs (Plate
9) and just west of a remnant concrete foundation from a previously demolished structure (Plate 10). Portions of each
surface feature overlap with the proposed ROW (see Figure 2b). Within the upper 25 cmbs of the trench, a sparse scatter
of rusted nails, brick fragments (Plate 11), burned whiteware and porcelain fragments, and stained window glass (Plate
12) was encountered within a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sand A-horizon. Below the historic artifact scatter at
around 40 cmbs, an inactive clay sewer pipe was uncovered in the west wall of the trench (Plate 13). The sewer pipe was
found within a brown (7.5YR 4/3) sand E-horizon that extended to 55 cmbs. This horizon was then underlain by a
transitional brown (7.5YR 5/4) sand EB-horizon between 55 and 80 cmbs and two reddish brown (5YR 4/4) and yellowish
red (5YR 4/6) sandy clay loam Bt-horizons between 80 and 250 cmbs. No artifacts or features were recorded below 40
cmbs in Trench 2.
Upon close inspection of the 1952 Sanborn Insurance Map of Waco (amended in 1953, 1954, 1955), the locations of the
concrete foundation, concrete debris, and Trench 2 are consistent with the previously mapped location of the General
Assembly of the Living God–Davis Memorial Hall once located at 1207 Earle Avenue. Further research revealed that the
memorial hall was only listed in the Waco City directories between 1955 and 1965; thus, the structure was apparently
demolished sometime before the collation of the 1966 directory. Subsequent to these findings, the area was assigned site
number 41ML298. Due to the limited data set available (see “Archeological Materials Identified” section below) and the
fact that the time period in question is relatively recent and well documented, the research potential of the site is limited.
Trenches 3 and 4 were excavated approximately 35 m and 70 m north of Trench 2, respectively. The trenches exhibited
nearly identical profiles (Plates 14 and 15, respectively), consisting of a brown (10YR 4/3) sand A-horizon with many
medium-sized stream-polished gravels between 0 and 40 cmbs, underlain by a strong brown (7/5YR 4/6) sand E-horizon
between 40 and 80 cmbs. This was then underlain by a weakly developed B-horizon consisting of a strong brown (7.5YR
5/6) sandy loam between 80 and 100 cmbs, followed by a series of Bt-horizons exhibiting an increase in clay content with
7

depth between 100 and 250 cmbs. A one-inch-diameter metal pipe was encountered in the southwest corner of Trench 4.
This pipe is similar to the one discovered in Scrape 2e south of the concrete debris and may also be associated with
remnants of the Davis Memorial Hall (site 41ML298) or other structures that once occupied adjacent properties. No other
cultural materials or features were encountered in Trenches 3 or 4.
Archeological Materials Identified: Within the trough-shaped pit identified within the west wall of Trench 1 in Area 1,
several temporally nondiagnostic materials were recovered including an iron rebar fragment, several pieces of rusted
metal, several yellow brick fragments, one clear bottle glass sherd, and one blue glass sherd. Due to its trough shape
and isolated nature, the trough was interpreted as a trash pit or remnant drainage ditch. The materials were not collected
and were reburied.
Numerous archeological materials were recovered from 41ML298 encountered within Trench 2 in Area 2. The numerous
nails, bricks, and stained window glass fragments recovered from Trench 2 were unspecific to a particular time period;
however, several materials recovered from the trench could be dated to a relatively specific time range. For example, the
whiteware fragment (Plate 16) dates to post-1890; however, ribbed molding decorations on the shoulder of the plate
suggest a manufacture date during the 1930s to 1950s. The ivory-tinted porcelain fragment (Plate 17) exhibits floral
decalcomania indicative of manufacture between ca. 1895 and 1950.
To determine the extent of historic artifact distributions encompassed by 41ML298, five additional trenches were
mechanically surface scraped to the west of Trench 2 (Scrapes 2a, 2b, and 2c) and to the west (Scrape 2d) and south
(Scrape 2e) of the concrete debris (see Figure 2b). Excavation of each scrape ceased at approximately 20–25 cmbs
because no artifacts were found below these depths. Scrape 2a yielded numerous brick fragments (Plate 18), Scrape 2b
yielded an unidentifiable metal object and fragments of concrete slabs painted red on one side (Plate 19), Scrape 2c (the
westernmost scrape) was sterile, and Scrape 2d yielded a cow-sized rib fragment, a large bolt and washer, a glass ink
container, a clear glass bottle base, and green bottle glass fragments (Plates 20 and 21). The valve mark on the base of
the glass ink container indicates that the item was likely manufactured ca. 1930–1945. Lastly, Scrape 2e (the
southernmost scrape) did not reveal continuation of the historic artifact scatter south of the concrete debris but did
uncover an in situ 1-inch-diameter metal utility pipe (Plate 22) that appeared to extend into the subsurface of the concrete
debris.
At the request of TxDOT District Archeologist John Arnn and District Environmental Coordinator Michael Rhodes, the
Gradall was used to carefully remove the concrete slabs from atop the concrete mound to expose the nature and extent of
structural remains. This subsurface investigation revealed a series of metal pipes remaining from an older plumbing
system, all covered by a light yellow sandy fill (Plate 23). Once the nature of the subsurface was examined, the concrete
slabs were placed back in their original position and no further excavations were performed at this location.
All of the archeological materials encountered from 41ML298 were recovered on private property. Only a representative
sample of cultural materials from 41ML298 was collected, particularly items that could potentially be dated upon further
research. Stephen Garner, the owner of the property in which the site was discovered, agreed to transfer of ownership of
artifacts to the State. As a result, the items collected will be temporarily housed at Geo-Marine, Inc., Plano, Texas, and
will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.
APE Integrity: The integrity of the deposits within the Area 1 APE has been compromised due to several factors. The
primary disturbance is associated with roadway construction and maintenance. Fill layers from roadway construction
were present in each trench excavated within Area 1 and ranged between 60 and 208 cmbs. There was not an A-horizon
present below the fill in Trench 1 indicating that it was previously truncated; thus, any cultural materials that were present
in this location would have been either destroyed or removed from their primary context. The identification of a roadway
buried below 2m of shale and concrete fill in Trench 3 indicates that deposits within this area retain very little if any
contextual integrity. Additional disturbances include the presence of numerous buried utilities within and just outside of
Area 1 (see Figure 2a). An abandoned buried telephone line and buried sprinkler system PVC pipe paralleled the
frontage road within the 15-ft wide corridor for the entire length of the project area. A buried natural gas line also
paralleled the frontage road within Area 1, but was located several feet outside of the project area. Water and sewer lines
were also present but were well outside of the project area in most cases; however, a storm sewer was located just below
the surface at the northern end of the project area. Finally, a Baylor fiber optics line runs perpendicularly across the
project area between Trench 2 and 3. In combination, construction activities have significantly compromised the integrity
of the majority of the deposits within Area 1. However, the identification of intact soil profiles below fill layers in Trenches
2 and 3 indicates that these areas maintain relatively good integrity below the fill.
The integrity of the deposits with the Area 2 APE has also been compromised due to several factors. The proposed ROW
cuts directly through remnants of a church foundation (41ML298) that was burned and razed approximately 44 years ago.
The destructive process resulted in the breakage and scattering of historic cultural materials and the haphazard
arrangement of concrete debris capping remnants of a plumbing system once associated with the razed church structure.
8

A buried metal utility pipe was observed extending south from the plumbing system and was also observed approximately
60 m to the north within the southwest corner of Trench 4. As a result, it is likely that some degree of surficial disturbance
has resulted from the previous land use of Area 2. Additional impacts to the integrity of the deposits within Area 2 include
the presence of rodent burrows up to 90 cmbs, and water and sewer lines that run within Area 2 at the southern boundary
of the project area and progress closer towards the western edge of the project area to the north (see Figure 2a). In
conclusion, the overall deposits in the Area 2 APE retain relatively good integrity, but deposits just below the surface have
been moderately disturbed, particularly at the location where 41ML298 was encountered.
Recommendations and Justification:
No burials were identified in any of the trenches excavated within Areas 1 and 2. Site 41ML298, encountered within Area
2, does not meet the criteria as enumerated under 36 CFR 60.4 and 13 TAC 26.8 to qualify for inclusion in the NRHP or
for designation as an SAL. No associations with important persons or events are known. The time period represented at
the site is relatively recent and well documented; thus, the research potential of the site is limited. Additionally, the
integrity of the site has been compromised due to impacts resulting from the burning and razing of the General Assembly
of the Living God–Davis Memorial Hall and previous road construction.
Pursuant to Stipulation VI of the First Amended Programmatic Agreement among the Federal Highway Administration, the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), the Texas State Historical Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council
on Historic Preservation Regarding the Implementation of Transportation Undertakings (PA-TU), and Stipulation (f)(2) of
the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and the Texas Historical Commission (43 TAC 2.24), TxDOT
finds that the area of potential effects does not contain archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16(1)) or sites
eligible for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. Accordingly, TxDOT recommends that the project be allowed
to proceed and that no additional archeological work is necessary. In the event that unanticipated archeological deposits
are encountered during construction, work in the immediate area will cease and TxDOT archeological staff will be
contacted to initiate post-review discovery procedures under the provisions of the PA-TU and MOU.

Front Matter
Report includes Hwy/limits, Counties, CSJ(s), District(s), Antiquities Permit #, Principal Investigator’s
name, investigative firm’s name, and date of publication. This information is provided on cover and title
page of draft and final reports or on first page of interim reports.
Abstract included in draft and final reports unless the investigation does not identify sites within the area of
potential effects (APE). It contains a description of findings, list of sites recorded, identification of which
artifacts were curated, and location of curation facility. (Abstract form and, when appropriate, curation form
must always accompany final reports.)
Management summary included in draft and final reports, which describes the context in which the work
was performed and identifies the investigation’s sponsor, the purpose of the investigation, the identity of the
institution conducting the investigation, the personnel involved in the investigation and their roles, the
person-hours invested in the project, and the dates of fieldwork. It should also include a brief summary of
the scope of work, a summary of the results, and the recommendations.
Introduction and Project Description
Introduction included in draft and final reports, unless the investigation does not identify sites within the
APE. The introduction describes the context in which the work was performed and identifies the
investigation’s sponsor, the purpose of the investigation, the identity of the institution conducting the
investigation, the personnel involved in the investigation and their roles, the person-hours invested in each
project phase, and the dates of fieldwork. It provides a brief summary of the methods and any difficulties
encountered in completing the project that affect the results, the curation facility, and the organization and
content of the succeeding sections.
Report includes a map of the area surveyed on a USGS 7.5’ Quadrangle or equivalent if 7.5’ Quad
unavailable. Map is included as separate attachment.
The project description clearly identifies the project type and any associated elements.
The project description identifies the APE in three dimensions, including the project limits, width, acreage,
and depth of impacts. The description of the APE identifies the maximum depth of impacts from the project,
referring to project plans or to typical impacts for this class of project.
The project description notes whether the project includes any new right of way, easements, or projectspecific locations; describes the location of any such features; and quantifies their area.
Clearly reproducible layouts are attached when available; layouts show the existing and proposed right of
way boundaries and easements.
Clearly reproducible profiles are attached when available.
Clearly reproducible typical sections are attached when available.
Background Information
Report includes description of topography, soils, and geology. Report references soil survey maps and
geological maps for the entire area surveyed or indicates that none are published for the area surveyed.
Report includes estimate of surface visibility, description of land use, and general description of vegetation
in and adjacent to the area surveyed.
Report includes discussion of previous work and sites within one kilometer of the area surveyed with
explicit reference to review of TARL files, THC Archeological Sites Atlas maps, and explicitly indicates
trinomials of sites or absence of sites within one kilometer. The study also includes a map of unevaluated
archeological sites, ineligible properties, and historic properties in and adjacent to the APE.
Report includes discussion of how the project setting, as detailed in criteria 12-14, affect the likelihood of
intact, buried deposits being present.
Methods
Report documents methods used. For intensive surveys, report documents compliance with THC/CTA
survey standards (as referenced in 13 TAC 26.20 and THC policy) or provides explicit, plausible
justification for deviation from THC/CTA standards. Documentation of compliance with THC/CTA
standards takes the form of an explicit description of the number and kind of transects surveyed and the
number and kinds of units excavated. Justification of deviations shall refer to project setting conditions that
affect the likelihood of archeological deposits with sufficient integrity to address important questions of

history or prehistory being present.
Report documents compliance with THC/CTA standards for site definition (as referenced in 13 TAC 26.20)
or provides explicit, plausible justification for deviation from THC/CTA standards. Documentation of
compliance with THC/CTA standards will take the form of an explicit description of the number and kinds
of units excavated. All sites have site trinomials assigned by Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Report documents locations of excavated units, and explicitly indicates which excavated units are on public
and private land.
Report explicitly states whether land surveyed is public, private or both and delineates boundaries on map.
Report explicitly documents which portions of the APE were investigated and which portions were not
investigated. Report also explicitly documents and justifies any variability in methods if the methods vary
across the APE.
Results
Report documents cultural materials recovered and observed and explicitly indicates which were
recovered/observed on public and private land. If no cultural materials were recovered/observed, the report
explicitly notes their absence.
For historic sites, the report notes the beginning and end dates of diagnostic artifacts. The report identifies
artifact types and distinguishes explicitly between modern trash and historically relevant materials
(materials greater than 50 years in age).
Report provides explicit quantification of observed artifacts and indicates whether collections were made.
The report indicates in the abstract and concluding chapter the repository where materials will be curated.
Report documents conditions that affect the integrity of the deposits within the area surveyed and describes
how these conditions would affect the integrity of archeological sites, regardless of whether any sites were
identified within the APE. As applicable, report states that no conditions exist to compromise integrity.
Evaluation of potential site integrity explicitly considers the aspects of integrity presented in 36 CFR 60.4.
Typically, the integrity of archeological sites is characterized by their integrity of location, design,
materials, and association.
To the extent possible given the class of survey, the report explicitly evaluates each site’s eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL), or explicitly states that additional work is necessary to make a determination. Where
determination is possible, report notes whether or not project will adversely affect eligible sites.
For Intensive Surveys: For historic sites, the report includes two of the following elements of historic
background to meet THC requirements for assessing site age and eligibility: Oral history, deed or tax record
research, other archival research, title search, other detailed historic research directly related to the specific
location of the site. (Reviewer comments required if “No”)
Evaluation of each site in the APE refers to relevant background information presented in the report.
Evaluation of each site in the APE incorporates data collected in the field regarding site constituents.
Evaluation of each site in the APE refers to data requirements needed to be eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP or for designation as a SAL.
Evaluation of each site in the APE refers to conditions affecting the integrity of the site constituents,
including the possibility that no conditions compromise integrity. Evaluation of site integrity explicitly
considers the aspects of integrity presented in 36 CFR 60.4. Typically, the integrity of archeological sites is
characterized by their integrity of location, design, materials, and association.
The report supports its conclusions with attached photographs, survey forms, and field note copies.
Finding or findings explicitly refer(s) to relevant sections of 36 CFR 800, 36 CFR 60, and 13 TAC 26.
Recommendations for further work are explicitly expressed and justified, including the necessary of level of
effort and locations within the APE that require such work. If portions of the APE were inaccessible, the
report makes explicit recommendations regarding the need for further work in those areas based on the
results of the background research, field results in adjacent areas, and observations on the inaccessible areas
made from adjacent, accessible areas. (Reviewer comments required if “No.” TxDOT reserves the right to
deviate from reported recommendations for additional work.)
Report provides a references section that contains all work cited.
