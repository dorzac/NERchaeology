ABSTRACT
North Texas Municipal Water District is proposing a new tank location, road, and
pipeline segment that will connect to its existing Rockwall to Royce City Pipeline
in Rockwall County, Texas. AR Consultants, Inc. surveyed the original alignments
in 2015. While the tank location and road were in areas with low potential for
archaeological sites, the pipeline route crosses near a structure location found on a
historic map. AR Consultants, Inc. recommended that the pipeline was the only
portion of the new project layout that required survey, and the Texas Historical
Commission agreed. During survey of the 1.9-acre study area, which was
conducted on March 31, 2017, the historic foundation was noted outside the current
project area. All four shovel tests dug in the project area were negative.
As such, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource
investigations are unwarranted and requests that that Texas Historical Commission
concur with this assessment. However, if this portion of the pipeline is rerouted
again prior to construction, more work may be necessary to determine the potential
impacts to the site. Additionally, if more artifacts or features are found during
construction, work should stop immediately and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission should be notified before work resumes. Field
documents, photos, etc. from this survey will be curated at the Center for
Archaeological Studies at Texas State University.

INTRODUCTION
North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) is proposing to construct a new tank, 1200-ftlong pipeline, and access road in Rockwall County, Texas. In 2015, ARC surveyed the 3-milelong Rockwall to Royse City Pipeline Route and portions of the Rockwall to Royse City Pipeline
Reroute (Hall and Coleman 2015; Coleman and Hall 2015). These were conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permits 7219 and 7393, respectively. Likely due to the upland setting of the project,
no prehistoric sites or isolates were identified during the surveys. During the reroute survey, site
41RW31, an early- to mid-20th century house site, was recorded and recommended not eligible for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The tank location proposed during the
original survey has been determined unusable and a new location has been chosen. The new 3.2acre tank location is approximately 400 m north of FM552, 750 m west of its intersection with
King Road. A pipeline route and road will connect the previously surveyed routes to the new tank
location (Figure 1).
The pipeline, road, and tank location are in the uplands, which are considered to have extremely
low prehistoric archaeological potential, which was confirmed by the two 2015 surveys. The THC
agreed that the uplands in this project area do not warrant survey. Therefore, the road (which
follows an existing road and avoids historic site 41RW31) and tank locations were not surveyed.
However, the pipeline passes through a wooded patch that matches the location of a structure
shown on the 1963 Rockwall, TX 7.5â USGS topographic map. As such, ARC proposed to survey
along the pipeline route through this property in a scope of work dated March 7, 2017; the THC
concurred with this strategy. The cultural resources survey was conducted March 30, 2017.
The cultural resource investigation was required because NTMWD is a State entity and Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 7956 was issued for the archaeological survey. Relevant legislation
includes the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). The
Archeology Division of the THC will review this report on behalf of the State.
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines adopted by the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission, and developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (n.d.).
The following report presents a brief description of the natural setting of the project area, followed
by a discussion of the culture history and previous investigations in the region surrounding the
study area. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed in the investigation is
then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes with recommendations
followed by the references cited.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF ROCKWALL TO ROYSE CITY TANK RELOCATION

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area is in the Northern Blackland Prairie Ecoregion of Texas (Griffith et al. 2007). In a
climax setting, the Blackland Prairie is an expanse of rolling tallgrass prairie. This region features
low, stair-step hills and plains (Bureau of Economic Geology 1996). The study area is located in
the uplands on the eastern periphery of the Camp Creek watershed.
The geology of the project area is anchored by the Upper Cretaceous-aged Marlbrook Marl
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1988). This formation consists mostly of calcareous clay with some
silt and glauconite. The study area is mapped on Houston Black clay soils with 0-3 percent slopes
and eroded Ferris clay with 5-12 percent slopes (Pringle 1977). Houston Black clay has a 60-inthick A horizon of very dark gray clay above the dark gray clay AC horizon, while Ferris clay has
a 6-in-thick A horizon of grayish-brown clay underlain by the light yellowish brown AC horizon.

CULTURAL HISTORY
The history and prehistory of North Central Texas is summarized in several reports prepared by
the University of North Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990; Brown and Lebo 1991; Ferring and Yates
1998). The most commonly used chronology for the region was established by Prikryl (1990) and
detailed by Todd (2014) and is summarized in Table 1. This chronology divides the Late
Prehistoric, the time from the use of the bow and pottery to the Historic Native American, into two
periods: Late Prehistoric I (A.D. 700 to 1200) and Late Prehistoric II (A.D. 1200 to 1600).

ca. 11,000 to 6,000 B.C.
Prehistoric Native American settlement in North Central Texas began at least 10,000 years ago as
attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points (Crook and Harris 1957) at the
Lewisville site and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 2001) in Denton County to the west. Moreover,
artifact collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff, and other Paleo-Indian points
from the surface of sites in the region. Though no Clovis points have been reported from Rockwall
County, six, three, and one have been found in adjacent Dallas Hunt, and Kaufman counties,
respectively (Bever and Meltzer 2007). The presence of exotic, non-local lithic resources indicates
that these early people traveled to territory where higher quality lithics were available, or were
involved in a system of raw material trading. These early people hunted now extinct large game,
but probably also foraged off the land.
The Archaic period (6,000 B.C.-A.D. 700) is characterized by increased alluviation of water
channels and a generally wetter environment than the previous period. This change in climate
resulted in modification of Native American subsistence patterns, with broad exploitation of
bottomland food resources. This, in turn, resulted in clusters of seasonal settlements along large
drainages, including the Trinity River and its various forks and tributaries, and a marked increase
in population density. With the advent of repeated, seasonal occupation of sites along drainages
came a perceived increase in territorial constrictions among different groups in the region, with
several authors citing the limited use of regional lithic resources as evidence of this trend (Skinner
1981; Prewitt 1983). The earliest Archaic peoples continued using exotic cherts for dart points,
but, as time passed, there was a subtle shift toward the use of locally-available stone, specifically
Uvalde Gravels, for stone tools (Menzer and Slaughter 1971; Prikryl 1990:47-65).
During Late Prehistoric I, a small amount of pottery appears at the Baggett Branch site, 41DL149
(Prikryl and Perttula 1995:189). From A.D. 1000 to 1300, pottery appears in North Central Texas
that has similarities to Caddo pottery. This similarity is not well understood, and may be the result

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF ROCKWALL TO ROYSE CITY TANK RELOCATION

of trade with Caddo to the east, adoption of Caddo ceramic manufacture, Caddo settlement in
North Central Texas, or some combination of these scenarios (Prikryl and Perttula 1995:189-190).
Arrowheads appear about this same time, signaling the bow and arrowâs introduction to the hunting
toolkit. Additionally, houses were found at the Cobb-Pool site, 41DL148 (Peter and McGregor
1988:140). Fritz (1993) mentions the use of corn for food in North Central Texas during this time
and Todd (1999) suggests that the presence of mussel shell hoes in North Central Texas indicates
some form of farming.
Stephenson (1952:305-312) tried to create a chronological sequence for the Upper Trinity River
Basin when he defined the Late Prehistoric Wylie Focus, which was dated to A.D. 1300 to 1600,
based on shell and clay-grit tempered pottery which, he believed, was Caddo in origin. The Wylie
Focus was characterized by large circular pits, no indigenous pottery, flexed burials (both single
and multiple and in poorly defined burial pits), maize agriculture and villages. The Wylie Focus
term was discarded when Bruseth and Martin (1987:280) dated pits at the Bird Point Island and
the Adams Ranch sites to the Late Archaic period.
It has been suggested that the climate was drier during the Late Prehistoric II (Crook and Huston
2015). Bison may have been utilized more than in Late Prehistoric I times. The presence of bisonscapula hoes, especially in northern North Central Texas, suggests an increase in horticulture or,
at least, its first appearance. This concept is supported by the presence of sites along sandy terraces
instead of floodplains, where Late Prehistoric I sites are found. Also, there is a marked Plains
influence on lithic tool assemblages in North Central Texas dating to this period (Prikryl 1990:80).
At the end of the Late Prehistoric periods, there appears to have been a general abandonment of
the North Central Texas area (Skinner 1988). Along the Red River in Montague and Cooke
Counties and across the Red River in Oklahoma, there is both archaeological and ethnographic
evidence of historic Taovaya, Wichita, and Yscani Indians (Bell et al. 1967; John 1992:204). Since
the Spanish could not subdue these tribes, they made them their allies with promises of help against
the Osages.
European occupation of area began with Spanish and French expeditions, and establishment of
trading settlements along the Red River in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries (Kumler 2015). Early
settlement of the region began in the 1840s when the Republic of Texas actively promoted the
migration of settlers by offering its most abundant asset: land (Staumbaugh and Staumbaugh 1958;
Northcutt 1998). Large tracts of undeveloped land were given to impresarios, who in turn,
promised to bring in a specified number of families into Texas. One of the first and largest
undertakings was that of W. S. Peters and his associates, known as the Texas Emigration and Land
Company, who formed the Peters Colony. Promoters of the Peters Colony recruited primarily nonTexan families, many of whom came from the Upland South of the United States.
Texas was annexed by the United States in 1846 the area that is now Rockwall County was part
of Henderson County and then Kaufman County in 1847 (Bass 2015). Finally, in 1873, Rockwall
County was formed. Around the same time, the construction of the railroad through Rockwall
caused a major shift in the regionâs economy toward agriculture, specifically cotton. Another major
shift has been taking place over the last 50 years as the county has been absorbed into the greater
Dallas metropolitan area, consequently becoming less rural.

Previous Investigations
A search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) confirmed that there are no archaeological
sites, NRHP properties, historical markers, or cemeteries within a 1-mi radius of the project area
(TASA 2017). The review also showed that relatively few archaeological investigations have been
carried out in the area. The largest archaeological survey in Rockwall County was conducted at
Lake Ray Hubbard (formerly Forney Reservoir) by the Dallas Archeological Society (Harris and
Suhm 1963). Thirty-three archaeological sites were recorded. This survey described 20 sites
already known to the Dallas Archeological Society membership (Hannah 1941; Hannah and Harris
1948; Harris 1948, 1960), and located 13 previously unrecorded sites. Limited excavations were
subsequently conducted at the Lower Rockwall site (Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968) and the Upper
Rockwall site (Ross 1966). These excavations provided evidence of the way of life practiced by
the prehistoric peoples who occupied this part of the East Fork valley. Recent work conducted by
ARC at 41RW2 (the Upper Rockwall site) recovered the portions of at least six individuals along
with animal bones and lithic artifacts (Whitley and Skinner 2014).
ARC has conducted several cultural resource surveys in Rockwall County, only one of which
found sites, features, or artifacts. In 1999, ARC surveyed a 30-acre area for three parks
approximately 9 mi south of the current project area for the City of Heath (Skinner 1999). ARC
also surveyed approximately 15,000 ft of sewer pipeline route adjacent to Sabine Creek for Royse
City but failed to discover any archaeological sites on the ground surface or in 48 shovel tests
(Todd 2004). The East Fork Water Reuse pipeline route, which runs north/south across Rockwall
County west of the study area, and the Lake Tawakoni Water Supply pipeline, which terminates
in southeastern Rockwall County, were surveyed by ARC (Todd 2006; Todd and Skinner 2005).
ARCâs survey conducted in March, 2015 for the Rockwall to Royce City Pipeline resulted in the
recording of the historic farmstead site 41RW30 (Hall and Coleman 2015). Due to previously
unknown plans to widen FM552, the Rockwall to Royse City Pipeline route paralleling that road
had to be moved and ARC conducted survey of the reroute in August 2015 (Coleman and Hall
2015). During this survey an early- to mid-20th century house site (41RW31) was recorded.
The earliest available maps that show structure locations in Rockwall County are the 1923 USDA
Soil Map and 1936 and 1954 General Highway maps, none of which show a structure in the project
area. The 1965 Rockwall, TX 7.5' USGS map shows an outbuilding approximately halfway
between FM552 and the proposed tank location along the pipeline route (Figure 1). Aerial
photographs from 1953 and 1961 (Figure 2) show the structure as well. Recent aerial photographs
show the area immediately surrounding the structure as a cluster of trees, suggesting at least
remnants of the structure remain.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Based on the research conducted prior to survey, it was anticipated that at least remnants of an
outbuilding from the mid-1900s would be found in the cluster of trees along the pipeline route.
Based on aerial photographs, these remnants, if present, would be more than 50 years old and
would be recorded as an archaeological site along with any associated artifacts. A trash scatter or
sheet midden may be present, with artifacts consisting of general agricultural trash, such as nails,
wire, building material fragments, etc. Given the upland setting, relatively far from reliable water
sources, prehistoric sites or artifacts were not anticipated.
Methodology
Survey was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth by the THC (n.d.). Field personnel
walked the 20-m-wide pipeline survey corridor in a single transect. Shovel tests were placed along
the pipeline route at 100-m intervals and near the study area edge as close to the known structure
location as possible. Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter. Clay fill from the shovel tests was
inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine if artifacts were present.
Shovel test matrices were described on the basis of composition, texture, and color. The Munsell
Soil Color Chart (2009) was used to identify soil colors. Field personnel made notes about the
ground exposure, drainages, soil types, and disturbed areas where subsoil was exposed.
Photographs were taken during the survey using a GPS-equipped digital camera. Shovel test and
project boundary locations were marked with a handheld GPS receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into two sections. The first describes the natural setting of the project area
and the survey results. Conclusions derived from the survey close the chapter. Shovel tests (STs)
are described generally throughout the text and are detailed in Table 2.
Survey Results
The survey corridor traverses an upland pasture from FM552 north for 340 m. The pasture is
covered with short grasses yielding 0-10 percent ground visibility (Figure 3). One intermittent
drainage is crossed by the pipeline and is lined with mesquite trees and taller grasses. The two
westernmost trees in the cluster marking the structure location are in the survey corridor.

Figure 3.

Project corridor, facing north. The shovel is at ST4; the drainage is in the
midground; and the tree cluster marking the structure location is left of center.

All that remains of the outbuilding in the cluster of trees is a concrete foundation with a wood post
in the north side (Figure 4). However, the foundation is 14 ft outside the project easement. A few
flat rocks (possibly from a foundation or piers), approximately 30 commercial brick fragments
(most broken to the size of half of a brick), and two ceramic pipe fragments were found at the base
of a tree within the easement (Figure 5). A few of the bricks were stamped with âMEXICOâ and
âU/CAMARGO/MEXICOâ (Figure 6). There are several manufacturers that produced bricks like
these during overlapping time periods spanning the mid-1800s through the 1960s, and it is difficult
to identify which producer these bricks came from (Jim Atkinson, personal communication 2017).
ST2 was dug on the western edge of the survey corridor as close to the foundation as possible and
ST3 was dug on the pipeline centerline (Figure 7). Both STs revealed a thin (20-30 cm) A horizon
of dark gray clay above the dark gray subsoil. No artifacts were found subsurface.

Conclusions
As was expected, no prehistoric cultural resources were found during the survey. All that remains
of the structure noted on the historic topographic map and aerial photographs is a concrete
foundation and wood post. However, these features are 14 ft outside the project study area and will
not be affected by the pipeline installation. Within the easement was a small pile of bricks and
ceramic pipe fragments that likely date to the mid-1900s and were probably associated with the
structure. No subsurface artifacts were found in the two STs placed within the easement near the
foundation.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present
along the portion of the Rockwall to Royse City Pipeline connecting the route paralleling FM552
to the new tank location. No archaeological sites were found within the study area. However, the
foundation of a historic outbuilding was noted just west of the easement. If the proposed impacts
of the pipeline move immediately west, additional cultural resources work should be conducted to
see if or how it impacts the yet unrecorded site.
ARC concludes that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted within the proposed
pipeline easement and recommends that the THC concur with this assessment. However, if the
pipeline is rerouted again, or if buried cultural materials are discovered during construction, ARC
recommends that work should cease in the area and that the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission should be notified before work resumes.
