ABSTRACT
Texas A&M University–Commerce has interred, on their university farm
property, the remains of three prehistoric Caddo individuals that were
contained in three wooden boxes. AR Consultants, Inc. was contracted by
TAMU-C to conduct archaeological survey of the proposed interment site
and to monitor the excavation of the trench in which the burials were
interred. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if cultural
resources were present in the area, and if so, to make recommendations
about their significance. TAMU-C consulted with the Texas Historical
Commission and the Caddo Nation on this plan to inter these remains.
This project is a result of those discussions. AR Consultants, Inc. was
never in possession of or ever had access to the remains. The individuals
were excavated in the early 1960s from site 41HU22, approximately 450
meters (m) to the north on the south bank of the channelized portion of the
South Sulphur River. The interment site is located near the south bank of
the original river channel, approximately 900 m northwest of the
intersection of State Highway 24 and County Road 4320. The 400 ft2
interment site was shovel tested on January 07, 2014 to determine if
cultural resources were present below the ground surface. None were
found on the surface or in the five shovel tests excavated at the location.
Then on January 28, 2014, members of the Caddo Nation and facility from
the TAMU-C attended an interment ceremony where the boxed remains
were laid to rest in an excavated trench. The trench was then backfilled
and the cemetery concluded. On January 31, 2014, a Notice of Existence
of Cemetery was filed with the Hunt County Clerk in accordance with
State Health & Safety Code (Chapters 711-714), which now defines this
area as a cemetery. As such, the site should be protected and maintained in
accordance with the law and the wishes of the Caddo Nation. AR
Consultants, Inc. requests that the Texas Historical Commission concur
with this recommendation.

INTRODUCTION
Texas A&M University–Commerce (TAMU-C) has interred, on their university farm
property, the remains of three Prehistoric Caddo individuals that were contained in three
wooden boxes. The individuals were excavated in the early 1960s from site 41HU22,
approximately 450 meters (m) to the north on the south bank of the channelized portion
of the South Sulphur River. The interment site is located near the south bank of the
original river channel, approximately 900 m northwest of the intersection of State
Highway (SH) 24 and County Road (CR) 4320 (Figure 1).
Associate Professor of Biology, Evan Paul Roberts, at East Texas State College (now
TAMU-C), first excavated the site in 1963. Most of what is known about the site comes
from two letters on file with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at the
University of Texas in Austin (UT) (Appendix A). The first letter is from Roberts to E.
Mott Davis (then at UT), which described a site on the south bank of the South Sulphur
River, four miles from the college. He believed the site was Caddoan based upon the
Maydelle Incised pottery he had recovered. He had already excavated three burials from
the site by the time he wrote the letter. The first two were flexed adult burials oriented
east-west and the third was only described as an infant burial. The pottery was associated
with the infant. He also describes numerous Gary dart points and he speculated that the
site had been occupied for a long time. He also believed there were many more burials,
but had limited resources to continue to excavate the site and hoped that Davis would be
able to help. Roberts also believed that the site might contain information equal or greater
than that of the Sander’s mound according to his letter. He expressed that “time was of
the essence” as many people in the area had learned about his work. Davis responded to
the letter with intrigue, but regretted that he would not be able to visit the site in person
due to his “many obligations.” However, he was sending a graduate student (J. Dan
Scurlock), within the next two to two and a half weeks to visit the site and hoped that
Roberts might work with the landowner to keep the “pot hunters” out until then. Davis
also expressed his thoughts on the information provide in Robert’s letter. He did not
believe the adults were Caddoan based on the flexed burial positions, but that the site
might be important and might cover a great length of time based on the artifacts.
AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) was contracted by TAMU-C to conduct archaeological
survey of the proposed interment site and to monitor the excavation of the trench in
which the burials were interred. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if
cultural resources were present in the area, and if so, to make recommendations about
their significance. Dr. Dan Edelman, Associate Provost and Vice President of Academic
Affairs consulted with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the Caddo Nation on
this plan to inter these remains. This project is a result of those discussions. ARC was
never in possession of or ever had access to the remains.
Since the TAMU-C is a political entity of the State of Texas, it is subject to the
Antiquities Code of Texas. Therefore, Texas Antiquities Permit number 6741 was issued
for the project. Relevant legislation includes the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas
Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). Once the remains are interred they will be

subject to the State Health & Safety Code (Chapters 711-714), which require newly
established cemeteries be registered with the state. The paperwork was filed with the
Hunt County Clerk on January 31, 2014 shortly after the interment, which was conducted
on January 28th, 2014 (Appendix B). This ceremony was attended by members of the
Caddo Nation and TAMU-C faculty. The final resolution document from the Caddo
Nation is in Appendix C.
This report is written in accordance with the report guidelines of the Archeology Division
of the THC, and developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following
report presents a brief description of the natural setting of the project area, followed by a
discussion of the cultural history of North Central Texas. A chapter on the methodology
employed in the investigation is followed by the results. The report concludes with
recommendations and references cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Hunt County is located is in the Blackland Prairie (Diamond et al. 1987:Figure 1). This
region consists of a well-defined band of prairie stretching south approximately 300 miles
from the Red River to just north of San Antonio. The terrain is essentially level to rolling
plains dissected by a number of drainages, with the northeastern portion of Hunt County
being drained by the Middle and South Sulphur rivers (Hallmark 1993). The interment
site is located on the south bank of the original South Sulphur River. For purposes of
flood control, this portion of the South Sulphur River was channelized in the early 1900s.
The study area is underlain by the Navarro Group undivided (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1966). This deposit is mostly clay, with some silt and sand and is between 500775 feet thick. Leson clay with 3 to 5 percent slopes (22) underlies the interment site
(Figure 2) (Lane and Janak 1981: Sheet 18). The profile for the Leson series consists of
stratified layers of black to very dark gray clay to a depth of 30 to 60 inches. This
typically rests on top of a Ck horizon of pale olive and dark gray mottled clay.

The Blackland Prairie is in the northern part of the larger Texan biotic province, which
characterizes much of North Central Texas (Blair 1950). Küchler (1966) classifies the
Blackland Prairie as grassland dominated by Andropogon-Sipa grasses, with isolated
stands of timber generally present along the drainages. The area supports scattered young

and old trees including bois d’arc, American elm, cedar elm, hackberry, pecan, oaks,
junipers, cottonwood, and honey locust along with various weeds and masses of green
briars. The prairie once supported a cover of tall grasses such as big bluestem and was
inhabited by now absent herbivores including bison and antelope. Certainly, deer
inhabited the narrow bottomland forests that lined the major drainages. Today, the
surface has been cleared of most trees, leaving a narrow greenbelt of forest along the
drainages, and the prairie supports bermuda and other grasses that have been invaded by
mesquites.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Prehistoric settlement of the Blackland Prairie of North Central Texas began at least
10,000 years ago. Since limited cultural resources studies have been conducted in the
eastern portion of Hunt County, the following discussion draws on information primarily
from Cooper Lake (Fields et al. 1997). The Prehistoric period has been divided into three
major periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric. Prehistoric periods presented
below are derived from radiocarbon dating of deposits at sites in North Central Texas.
Historic Anglo-American
Historic Native American
Late Prehistoric/Caddoan
Late Period
Early Period
Archaic
Late
Middle
Early
Paleoindian

A.D. 1840 to the present
A.D. 1700 to1850
A.D. 700 to 1700
A.D. 1200 to 1700
A.D. 700 to 1200
6,000 B.C. to A.D. 700
1500 B.C. to A.D. 700
4000 to 1500 B.C.
6000 to 4000 B.C.
10,000 to 6,000 B.C.

The Paleoindian period is attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points.
Early inhabitants relied on an economy of hunting and gathering, with primary emphasis
being on the hunting and processing of megafauna (mammoth and bison). Clovis period
sites are rare in North Central Texas, and the Lewisville site (Crook and Harris 1957;
1958) and the Aubrey site (Ferring 2001) are two sites recorded in Denton County from
this period. These campsites were deeply buried, and thus preserved, in the floodplain
sediments of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Limited surface artifacts dating to this
period have been reported from the Hunt County area (Bever and Meltzer 2007: Table 1).
Sites types may include campsites or kill sites, and until recently, the reported evidence
for Paleoindian occupation in Hunt County included one Clovis point. However, the
recent recording of the Brushy Creek Clovis site expands the evidence for early
occupation in Hunt County (Crook et al. 2009). At the Brushy Creek site, two Clovis
points, scrapers, gravers, blades, and a hammerstone as well as the mineralized remains
of mammoth, mastodon, bison, and horse were recovered. Although these artifacts and
remains were not recorded in situ, the collective material appears to represent a Clovis
occupation.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from about 6,000 B.C. to A.D. 700. Archaic
populations lived throughout North Central Texas but particularly along the major and
minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather foods and resources. Dart
points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are artifacts commonly found at
Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic populations continued making and using exotic cherts
for dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local lithics, such as
Uvalde Gravels, for chipped stone tools. Few Archaic sites in Hunt County have been

ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AT TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY-COMMERCE

thoroughly investigated, yet based upon information derived from the Limerick site
(Duffield 1961:101), Late Archaic peoples continued a hunting and gathering lifestyle in
the region. Recent studies of the Hess site in Hunt County (Crook and Hughston 2009)
note that the artifact assemblage has characteristics similar to Late to Transitional
Archaic sites described by Prikryl (1990). In the region, sites have been recorded at the
intersection of creeks and along the major rivers.
The Late Prehistoric is signaled by the appearance of ceramics and arrow points in the
first millennium A.D. The Late Prehistoric I period is also signaled by the appearance of
houses and corn horticulture. Locally made pottery appears to be heavily influenced by
Caddoan Alto and Sanders phase types. The Late Prehistoric II is characterized by the
appearance of a Plains Village-like artifact assemblage. Harahey knives, thumbnail
scrapers, and flake drills are frequently found with Perdiz arrow points. In some cases,
these artifacts have been found with bison kills and in other cases bison scapulae had
been used to make hoe blades. Nocona Plain, a shell-tempered pottery, occurs during this
prehistoric period and is believed to be locally made.
The Protohistoric period of North Central Texas begins with the entrance of the Spanish
around A.D. 1541. At about this time, immigrant Native American groups moved into the
same area and either displaced the prehistoric inhabitants or moved into areas that had
previously been abandoned. The beginning of this period was marked by the limited and
sporadic contact between European explorers and the native occupants. The introduction
and adoption of the horse, and ultimately firearms, resulted in a shift from a more
sedentary seasonal occupation to emphasis on the hunting of bison. A wide variety of
historic Native American groups inhabited this part of Texas, yet there are very few sites
attributed to this period in this region (Skinner 1988), but sites are reported from nearby
Emory.
Settlement in Hunt County began in 1839, when Anglo-Americans began to build homes
on land grants first procured from Mexico in 1835 (Harper 2014). Settlement was slow in
these early years, with less than 350 occupants in Hunt County when it was established in
1848. Due to the absence of railroads or navigable waterways for shipping goods to
market, Hunt County’s early settlers practiced subsistence agriculture. What goods sent
to market were hauled overland, generally east to Jefferson. The town of Commerce was
established in 1878 on such a trade route, near a then-new crossing of the South Sulphur
River (Wade 2014).
Railroads arrived in Hunt County in 1880, when the East Line and Red River Railroad
reached Greenville. In 1887 the St. Louis Southwestern Railway connected Commerce
with such markets as Texarkana, Sherman, and Fort Worth. Thereafter, with easy access
to markets, commercial agriculture began to dominate the county’s economy, with cotton
the main cash crop. The county economy exploded rapidly after the arrival of the
railroads, attracting new investment and development, including East Texas Normal
College (now TAMU-C), which was established in Commerce in 1894. Cotton culture
boomed until the deprivations caused by the Great Depression drove many from the land.
However, county farms continued to be productive, and were aggregated into
______________________________________________________________________________________

ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AT TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY-COMMERCE

increasingly larger operations that became mechanized. In addition, the county’s
agricultural economy became diversified, with livestock being raised on a commercial
scale. Manufacturing became an important industry in the post-World War II era, and
today larger communities, such as Commerce and Greenville, feature significant
manufacturing sectors.
Previous Investigations
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA), relatively few cultural
resources surveys have been conducted in this portion of the South Sulphur watershed in
northeastern Hunt County (TASA 2014). The nearest large area investigated for cultural
resources is Lake Chapman (formerly Cooper Lake), which was studied over the course
of several decades (Johnson 1962; Hyatt and Skinner 1971; Hyatt et al. 1974; Doehner
and Larson 1978; Doehner et al. 1978; Jurney and Bohlin 1993; Fields et al. 1997;
Perttula 1999). During these studies, researchers found that most of the sites were located
on slight elevations within the floodplain or along interfluves.
The nearest survey to the study area was a survey conducted for the Cooper Pipeline.
From 1993-1995, Geo-Marine, Inc. conducted archaeological reconnaissance, intensive
pedestrian survey, and mechanical testing along the Cooper Pipeline route (Hunt et al.
1997). Reconnaissance was conducted in the western portion of the line where
installation had already occurred, intensive pedestrian survey and backhoe testing was
conducted. Overall, along the pipeline route, six prehistoric and historic sites were
recorded. The prehistoric sites (41HU49, 41HU53, and 41HU62) contained surface or
shallow deposits, with limited artifacts recorded in the top 20-40 cm.
In 1995, the City of Commerce constructed an 18-inch sewer line along and through an
unnamed tributary of the South Sulphur River. Although a Nationwide permit 26 was
applied for construction of a drainage channel, no evaluation or assessment of historic or
prehistoric resource was conducted before the construction of a drainage channel or
installation of the pipeline. Therefore an on-site inspection was conducted during the time
of pipeline installation in 1995 (Skipper Scott, personal correspondence 2013). One
shallowly buried prehistoric site was recorded, with several quartzite flakes to a depth of
20 cm. A portion of the pipeline was rerouted, and no further investigations were
conducted.
Only two sites are recorded within a mile of the interment site. The first is 41HU22,
which was previously discussed. The second is 41HU30, which is located on a knoll at
the edge of the floodplain. The site was recorded by Bill Young and is described as
containing shell bivalves and lithic material (TASA 2014). Additionally, two other sites
have been recorded on the channelized portion of the South Sulphur River downstream
from 41HU22 (TASA 2014). 41HU29 was also recorded by Young and is 1.5 mi to the
east. This site consists of artifacts exposed in a road cut, and includes dart points, a
scraper, a utilized flake, and some mussel shell. 41HU19, which is a scatter of flakes
located 2.25 mi east of the 41HU22, was recorded by Milton Bell in 1973.

Historic maps were reviewed to determine if historic structures or resources would be
affected by this project. Maps reviewed included the 1934 Hunt County Soil Map (USDA
1934), the 1940 and 1961 General Highway Maps of Hunt County (Texas State Highway
Department 1940, 1961), and the 1964 Commerce South, Texas 7.5’ USGS map. No
structures were found within the ¼ mile of the study area on any of the maps.

METHODOLOGY
Methodology
The field investigator examined the 0.009-acre (400 ft2) area, and made thorough field
notes about ground exposure, soil types, and disturbed areas. Five exploratory shovel
tests were excavated. Shovel tests were excavated to the bottom of the Holocene deposit
(THC n.d). Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter. The clay fill from the shovel tests
was inspected visually and broken into small chunks in order to determine if cultural
materials were present. Photographs were taken throughout the survey area using a digital
camera. Shovel test matrices were described on the basis of composition, texture, and
color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart (2010) was used to identify soil colors. Shovel test
locations were recorded using a Garmin GPS receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into two sections: The first describes the study area’s setting and
the initial shovel testing conducted on January 7, 2014. The second section presents
monitoring of the interment trench and associated ceremony conducted on January 28,
2014.
Initial Survey
The interment site sits on the edge of the South Sulphur floodplain in an upland pasture in
the northeast corner of the TAMU-C farm property, just south of the original South
Sulphur River channel. At the time of the survey, the area was covered in short grasses
and weeds. The general area contained numerous oak, cottonwood, and cedar trees.
Ground visibility was between 0 and 50 percent. Five shovel tests were excavated within
the 400 ft2 area. All but the fifth shovel test contained dark brown or very dark grayish
brown silty loamy clay or loamy clay over mottled clay between 20 and 30 cm below the
surface (cmbs). All five contained a Ck horizon of mottled brown and yellowish brown
clay between 40 and 70 cmbs. No cultural resources were recovered in the shovel tests or
observed on the surface.

Interment
On January 28, 2014, members of the Caddo Nation, which included Bobby Gonzalez,
performed a site cleansing ceremony for interment of the remains (Figure 5).
Additionally, several members of the TAMU-C facility and representatives from ARC
attended the ceremony. A trench was opened on the west side of the 400 ft2 area. The
trench was oriented north/south so that the remains could be oriented east/west (Figure
6). The trench was one meter deep by one meter wide and three meters long (Figure 7).
After the trench was opened, the remains were brought out by TAMU-C police officers
and members of the Caddo Nation began preparing for the ceremony (Figure 8). They
built a fire on the east side of the trench and began cleansing the location. During the
ceremony, the boxed remains were placed in the trench and it was closed (Figure 9).
After the ceremony was over, Bobby Gonzalez expressed that the Caddo Nation would be
working with TAMU-C on a plan to protect the site as a cemetery and ensure that it was
properly maintained.

Based on the negative results of the initial survey and the opening of the trench at the
interment site, it is AR Consultants, Inc.’s conclusion that no cultural resources were
impacted by the interment. Therefore, no further cultural resource studies are
recommended. Based on the definitions of a cemetery in the State Health & Safety Code
(Chapters 711-714) the interment site has been recoded as a cemetery with Hunt County.
As such, the site should be protected and maintained in accordance with the law and the
wishes of the Caddo Nation. The final resolution document from the Caddo Nation is
presented in Appendix C. ARC requests that the Texas Historical Commission concur
with this recommendation.
