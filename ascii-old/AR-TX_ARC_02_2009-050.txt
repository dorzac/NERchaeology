ABSTRACT
The Stephens Regional Special Utility District (Stephens SUD) plans to
construct several improvements to their water system. The improvements
include the construction of approximately 6.9 miles of water line and
improvements to the existing pump station near the town of Breckenridge,
Texas. One prehistoric lithic procurement site, 41SE307, was recorded
during the survey. The artifacts were thinly scattered over 300 meters of
the water line route, and no diagnostic materials were recorded. The site is
considered ineligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places
due to no datable artifacts, poor contextual integrity, therefore no further
investigations are recommended. AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that
the Stephens RSUD proceed with the construction of the waterlines and
improvements to the pump station without the need for further cultural
resource investigations. In addition, if buried cultural resources are
uncovered during construction of the project, work should cease
immediately and Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
The Stephens Regional Special Utility District (Stephens SUD) plans to construct several
improvements to their water system in Stephens County, Texas. The improvements
include the construction of approximately 6.9 miles of 10” and 12” water lines to the
north and south of Breckenridge, Texas and improvements to the existing pump station
(Figure 1). Jacob & Martin, Ltd. of Abilene, Texas contracted with AR Consultants, Inc.
(ARC) to conduct an archaeological survey of the high probability areas within the
proposed northern and southern routes as defined by ARC and agreed upon by the Texas
Historical Commission in a desktop assessment of the study area dated August 11, 2009.
The high probability areas are located in the Gonzales Creek Watershed near the creek
drainage and on high points such as knolls or bluff faces. Low probability areas are
sections of the proposed waterline routes that transverse the uplands set back from
Gonzales Creek and have been heavily utilized in the 20th c. as pastures or for oil and gas
production.
The purpose of this investigation was to identify any cultural resources present within the
high probability areas and to make recommendations about the significance and how they
might be impacted by installation of the waterline, pump station or tank. The cultural
resource investigation was required because the Stephens SUD received funding for the
system improvements from the Texas Water Development Board, which is a political
entity of Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5375 was issued for the archaeological
survey.
This report was written in accordance with the report guidelines adopted by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission and developed by the Council
of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the
natural setting of the project area. This is followed by the cultural history portion of the
report. The research design and methodology follow, then the results of the field survey
are presented in the major section of the report. Recommendations conclude the text, and
lastly a list of references cited ends the report

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area is located in central Stephens County at the divide between the Rolling
Plains of West Texas (Diamond, Riskind and Orzell 1987:209) and the Western Cross
Timbers region of central Texas (Dyksterhuis 1948 Figure 1). The town of Breckenridge
rests on a divide of Pennsylvanian-age formations of Harpersville Limestone, Black Rock
Limestone and the undivided Thrifty and Graham Formations. These formations include
mudstone, shale, sandstone and limestone. Chert is not generally found in any of these
formations. Quaternary sediments are present along the Gonzales Creek channel, which
bisects the study area, and remnants of Quaternary terrace are present at the edges
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1972).
A variety of silty, loamy and clayey soils occur in the uplands throughout Stephens
County (Cypiran 1994). The upland soils tend to be shallow, and in many areas,
limestone and sandstone bedrock are present on the surface or just below the soil. Frio
and Gagsby floodplains soils are located along Gonzales Creek and include alluvial
deposits of loam, clay and sand.
The study area is bisected by Gonzales Creek and the proposed waterline routes cross two
of the creeks intermittent tributaries; Hitson and Big Branch. Gonzales is mapped as
perennial through the study area, but further to the south is shown as intermittent. This is
most likely due to the dams that are located along the drainage near the town of
Breckenridge which allow the channel to hold water year round. Permanent springs are
rare in this region and seep springs flow only for a short period of time.
Vegetation in the uplands of the Western Cross Timbers has changed dramatically in the
last century from the short and tall prairie grasses encountered by settlers to invasive
species such as cactus, cedar and mesquite. Live Oak and mesquite can still be found
along drainages (Bureau of Economic Geology 2000).

CULTURE HISTORY
A well-defined cultural chronology for Stephens County has not been developed as few
archaeological investigations have been conducted in this marginal environment between
the Rolling Plains and Western Cross Timbers. Since the Rolling Plains of Texas falls
into the larger Southern Great Plains region in the southwest, a general cultural
chronology developed of the Southern Great Plains is synthesized below. The major
prehistoric cultural stages are the Paleoindian, the Archaic and the Late Prehistoric and
are defined by environmental and technological changes that had occurred in the past.
The earliest evidence of human occupation in Texas is in the Paleoindian period (11,500
– 5500 BC) yet the cultural material is sparse (Hofman 1989:25). A survey of recorded
Paleoindian points was conducted in the 1990s and in 2005 to identify the number of
distinctive fluted Clovis points in Texas counties, yet no Clovis points were found in
Stephens County (Meltzer and Bever 2007:66). The Paleoindian period falls within the
Pleistocene epoch, in which climate and vegetation were markedly different than the later
Holocene, with a cooler and wetter climate than the present day (Hughes 1991:8-9;
Mallouf 1989:83). There are primarily three site types for this period: big-game kill sites,
habitation areas referred to as campsites, which were used also for lithic production,
butchering or processing station sites, and lithic procurement or quarry sites (Hughes and
Willey 1978; Boyd 1989; Mallouf 1989:81).
The Archaic is typically divided into the Early, Middle and Late periods (Hofman
1989:45). Major climatic shifts occurred, eventually settling into a warmer and drier
environment similar to the modern one, with an increase in grasslands and a reduction of
forests. Site types that occur during this time period are similar to those in the Prehistoric
such as bison kill sites and campsites. During the Early Archaic period (5500 – 3000
BC), hunting for small game became the major form of subsistence which is evidenced
by a shift in lithics styles (Hughes 1991:15). Although bison kill sites date to the Archaic
(Hofman 1989:45), the large, stemless lance points of the Paleoindian period were
replaced with lithics such as stemmed dart points, and grinding implements such as
manos and hearth stones appear at this time. Evidence for long term occupation during
this period is scarce due to a long drought that may have caused the uplands to be
abandoned for more favorable settings near reliable water sources, and there are few
cultural resources to accurately describe occupation patterns in this time period (Hofman
1989). There are few sites that are clearly dated to the Middle Archaic (3000 – 1000 BC)
(Boyd 1989:39). The Late Archaic period (1000 BC – AD 200) is characterized by the
use of multiple types of dart points for hunting bison and other game (Hughes 1991:20).
Thousands of sites from the Late Archaic are found in the Southern Plains indicating a
dramatic population increase from the Middle Archaic, with the prominent site types
being open campsites that were near playa basins and along streams (Hughes 1991:21).
The Late Prehistoric period (AD 200 – 1700) is recognized as the period of transition
between hunter gather societies of the Archaic to the more settled villages of the Late
Prehistoric (Hughes and Willey 1978:28). Also, there is an increase in occupation of the
region (Boyd 1989). The climate appears to have been moister with an increase in

reliance on deer and smaller mammals for subsistence (Hofman and Brooks 1989:61).
The introduction of the bow and arrow in the Late Prehistoric coincides with the
appearance of pottery and pit-houses on the Southern Plains (Hughes 1991:24).
Agricultural practices appear during this period, yet probably post date the appearance of
ceramics (Boyd 1989:44-45).
Historic
Spanish explorers were probably the first Europeans to enter the region in the 16th
century, followed by other Euroamerican settlers using the transcontinental wagon roads,
one of which passed east of Breckenridge in the 1850s (Saunders, Mueller-Wille and
Carlson 1992:39). Native American occupation in the Southern Plains during the historic
period was closely tied to the introduction of horses by Europeans in the 17th and 18th
century (Newcomb 1984). Although the Comanche dominated the area until the mid1800s once Texas became a state, settlers developed permanent residences in Stephens
County and forts were constructed to protect their livelihood (Breckenridge/Stephens
County Sesquicentennial Book 1987:324). Places like Picketville just north of
Breckenridge and Fort Davis in northeastern Stephens County were known as “citizen
forts” as the residences had banded together “behind a line of pickets” to defend
themselves against attack (Breckenridge/Stephens County Sesquicentennial Book
1987:325; Saunders et al. 1992:47). By 1875, the Indians had retreated from settled areas
and the plains were safe for European settlers. The population slowly increased after the
civil war and the primary industry was agricultural, followed by some mining. At the
beginning of the 20th century, oil exploration had begun in the county, and from 1920 to
1921, the town of Breckenridge grew from 1510 to 30,000. This boom economy did not
last past the Great Depression, and the town populations shrank significantly (Saunders et
al. 1992:51).
Previous Investigations
The earliest recorded archaeological investigations conducted in Stephens County were
by Cyrus N. Ray in 1931 at a site along Hubbard Creek, approximately 10 miles west of
Breckenridge (Saunders et al. 1992:20). Ray recovered burned rock, mussel shell, manos,
metates, scrapers and a patinated projectile point. In addition, two flexed burials were
found in the cut bank of the creek.
The best overview of previous investigations surrounding the study area is presented in
the South Bend Lake report for the survey of a proposed reservoir in Young, Stephens
and Throckmorton counties (Saunders et al. 1992:19-51). During this large area survey,
multiple sites were recorded along Hubbard Creek as well, which is just north of the
present study area. Over 37,000 acres along the Brazos and Clear Fork of the Brazos
rivers were surveyed. During these investigations, 541 prehistoric, 168 historic sites were
recorded and 522 isolated finds from the historic and prehistoric periods were identified.
Prehistoric sites dated from the Paleoindian through the Late Prehistoric periods, while
historic sites ranged from time of European contact to the 1930s (Saunders et al.
1992:vii).

During the archival research, a review of the Texas Archeological Site Atlas (TASA) and
the Breckenridge, Grand Lake, Necessity and Buck Mountain USGS maps showed
several recorded cultural resources near the proposed waterlines. The first area, which is
south of the proposed waterline by 2130 feet, is the Picketville Cemetery, which is all
that remains of the town of Picketville north of Breckenridge on the banks of Gonzales
Creek. The town was founded before the Civil War and was once the county seat, yet
after Breckenridge became the county seat in 1876, Picketville was eventually abandoned
(Breckenridge/Stephens County Sesquicentennial Committee 1987). Little evidence
remains of the town, as the cemetery was unfortunately bulldozed in the 1960s (Edwards
1997; Maxwell 1980), yet evidence of the fort, church, schoolhouse and homesteads may
still be visible in the form of foundation stones, cisterns or trash scatters. The second area
of interest is a small knoll on the east side of Gonzales Creek where a prehistoric
campsite, 41SE290 is located. The site was recorded during an archaeological
reconnaissance by the Texas Water Development Board for wastewater system
improvements (Fox 1992). The proposed alternate route for the waterline appears to cross
the knoll. In 2004, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted a survey of proposed waterline
improvements throughout Stephens County, yet no significant cultural resources were
found (Skinner 2004).
In addition to a review of TASA, a visit was made to the Simpson Memorial Museum
and the Breckenridge Library as part of the archival research. At the museum, several
collections of native American stone tools are displayed, and those collected by Dean
Reimund were of special interest as he labeled many of the Archaic and Late Prehistoric
points with landowner initials from where they were collected in the county. In addition
to the points, Reimund collected manos and metates, some of which were collected
around the Hitson Branch drainage in the southeast portion of the study area.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
During the records review, areas of high and low potential for cultural resources were
identified within the study area and survey was recommended for the high potential areas.
The high potential areas are in the Gonzales Creek Watershed. Previous investigations
have identified prehistoric and historic sites near water sources and on terraces
overlooking drainages.
The proposed route crosses Gonzales Creek twice. Near the south where the proposed
and alternate routes cross the Gonzales Creek there is a steep slope on the east side of the
creek which might be the site of rock shelters. Several rock shelters have been recorded
in Stephens County with one site, 41SE2, being located 4 miles southeast of
Breckenridge. Although chert points have been collected in the Gonzales Creek
Watershed, no lithic procurement sites have been recorded in this area. Recorded lithic
procurement sites are to the south and west of the town of Breckenridge; based on this
evidence it is likely that prehistoric sites will be located on high points near the drainages
in the form of lithic scatters, campsites, rock shelters, and possibly burials. No sites have
been recorded in the Gonzales Creek floodplain, yet if deep floodplain soils were
recorded during shovel testing, trenching would be conducted to determine if there were
buried deposits near the bore points.
The low potential areas are the sections of the two proposed routes that transverse the
uplands and are set back from Gonzales Creek and its tributaries. These relatively level
areas have thin topsoil and are used primarily as pastures or for oil and gas production,
which is evidenced by the plethora of wells and lease roads throughout the study area.
Methodology
An intensive archaeological survey was conducted of the high potential areas within the
proposed waterline route of approximately 6.9 miles. The alternate routes were not
surveyed due to landowner access issues. The waterlines will be open cut except for the
creek crossings, where they will be bored at least 50’ back from the banks. The
construction easement was 30’ wide, and a 100’ corridor was surveyed to allow for
micro-siting of the waterline alignment. The high probability areas were walked by a
crew of two in parallel transects spaced approximately 20 meters apart. Shovel testing
was conducted along the route following the guidelines recommended by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (2002) and adopted by the THC. Shovel tests were concentrated at
closer intervals at the creek crossings to determine the extent of the floodplain from the
creek banks, and at the creek crossing shovel testing was supplemented with the use of a
4 inch bucket auger. Trenches were placed at the bore point locations due to the depth of
the floodplain soils identified in the shovel tests near the banks of the creek. Notes were
made about the ground exposure, surface artifacts, soil types and disturbed areas where
subsoil was exposed. Photographs were taken along the route using a Canon Elph 2.0
mega pixel digital camera. Shovel tests and trench locations were recorded with a
handheld Garmin GPSmap 76 receiver. Non-diagnostic artifacts were recorded, sketched
and photographed in the field but were not collected for curation.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into four sections starting with a description of the study area
followed by a discussion of the linear survey. The third section describes the results of
the trenching along Gonzales Creek followed by conclusions summarizing the study.
Shovel tests and trench locations are shown on Figures 2 and 6 and are described in detail
in the appendixes.
Study Area
Two high potential sections of the proposed waterline routes were surveyed. The first
section surveyed was located north of the town of Breckenridge and extended from US
183 to the east side of Gonzales Creek. The terrain was relatively level except where it
sloped gently towards the creek. Ground visibility was very good, with few areas of the
survey route with less than 30 percent. The route paralleled a fence line and crossed
through pastures that had been chained. Vegetation consisted of mesquite trees, prickly
pear cactus, and a thin cover of grasses. The route was adjacent to lease roads and natural
gas well pads. The pump station improvements will occur at an existing station where
gravel pad and soil covered the pad.
The second high potential section surveyed was located south of the town of
Breckenridge and was between US 183 and US 180. The survey began east of Hitson
Branch and the terrain sloped gently downward towards Gonzales Creek to the west.
Ground visibility was excellent throughout the majority of the route. The vegetation was
similar to that within the northern route, and bedrock was exposed on the surface on slope
edges where the topsoil had eroded away.
The Survey
Survey of the northern section was conducted from west to east and 15 shovel tests were
excavated in this section of the waterline route ROW (Figure 2). Within a 300-meter
stretch along the fence line between SH 183 and Gonzales Creek, flakes and worked
gravels were recorded on the surface between the elevation of 1170 and 1184 feet.
Ground visibility along this section of the route was very good, between 70 and 100
percent.
The scatter of artifacts intermixed within the gravels was recorded as a lithic procurement
site 41SE307. The gravel deposit consisted primarily of quartzite and hematite, with
some small light tan and grey chert gravels intermixed in the surface deposit (Figure 3).
Thinly spread out over the 300 meters stretch, a chert core and multiple flakes were
located on the surface yet no diagnostic artifacts, or other cultural materials were
recorded in the shovel tests or on the surface (Figure 3). The extent of the gravel deposit
continued outside the study corridor to the north. It appeared to be a lag gravel deposit,
that was once used by the prehistoric occupants for the procurement of the knappable
chert gravels to manufacture chipped stone tools (Figure 4). The site appears to be

disturbed from previous chaining and pipeline installation. Due to these factors and the
lack of contextual integrity, no further investigations are recommended nor is the site
considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

At the northern Gonzales Creek crossing, the channel was approximately 5 meters wide
and the banks were over 3 meters high. Water was present in the drainage at the time of
the survey, and the banks showed several meters of soil overlying gravels above
decomposed bedrock (Figure 5). Four shovel tests (ST3-6) supplemented by augering
were placed within 100 feet of the banks of the creek, and those closest to the creek
uncovered sandy, laminated soils to depths up to 150 cm which are typical of floodplain
deposits. At the bottom of shovel test ST4, the soil was loose and dry and could not be
brought up in the bucket auger. Shovel tests ST7-9 were placed in areas with low ground
visibility in the uplands east of the creek drainage, and had sandy loam to depths of 110
cm where the soil became too loose to excavate with the bucket auger. In the eastern end
of this section of the waterline a thin surface gravel deposit was recorded and several
chert flakes were noted yet they were not associated with any other artifacts.
Approximately 350 meters from the creek in a shallow washed out area south of the
fenceline, a shovel test (ST10) encountered 2 chert flakes between 20-30 cm. Subsequent
shovel tests (ST11-15) were placed in the cardinal directions, but no additional cultural
material was found on the surface or below.

Survey of the high potential areas southern section of the waterline route was conducted
from east to west in parallel transects. The route crossed through areas where drilling for
natural gas was being conducted, and crossed over multiple gravel roads west of Hitson
Branch then terminated on the western side of Gonzales Creek (Figure 6). Ground
visibility was very good (between 50 and 80 percent) throughout the majority of this
section of the waterline route, and limestone rocks were noted on the surface. Two shovel

tests (ST16-17) were placed in an overgrown pasture and where ground visibility was
poor, and compact brown loamy clay was encountered on the surface. Both shovel tests
were negative for cultural material.
The waterline crossing of Hitson Branch is in an area that has been heavily utilized for oil
and gas production (Figure 7). The Hitson Branch was less than 2 meters wide and barely
a meter deep. Small pools of water stood in shallow areas, but the drainage was dry at the
time of the survey. No cultural material was found in the creek channel nor on the rises
above the channel valley. A steep rocky slope was encountered east of Gonzalez Creek.
The rock overhangs were inspected for evidence of rockshelters or pictographs, yet no
cultural manifestations were found. The large boulders were spread out over the slope,
and there were no bluff faces in the exposed rock formation.

Figure 6.

Eastern end of the southern section of the proposed pipeline route, view is
facing east.

Four shovel tests (ST18-21) were placed on the banks of the southern Gonzales Creek
crossing. On the east bank, dark yellowish brown sandy clay was encountered at 90 and
100 cm respectively. The topsoil was very compact and cemented, most likely due to the
drought conditions Stephens County was experiencing during the summer season. On the
west bank, the waterline route jogs to the south to cross FM 2231, the turns to the west
again. At this crossing, compact loam with gravels was encountered in STs 20 and 21 at
70 and 15 cm respectively. At this crossing, the creek channel was filled with water and
was approximately 3 meters across, with the banks 3-4 meters in height. The banks were
examined for cultural material, but nothing was found on the banks or the shovel tests.

Trench Descriptions
Due to the deep floodplain soils encountered in the shovel tests along the creek, trenches
were placed at the four pipeline bore points for crossing the Gonzalez Creek floodplain
(see Figures 2 and 7 for trench locations). The trench locations deviate slightly from the
centerline of the pipeline route, as the waterline will be routed at these crossings to align
with the bore points and to avoid existing pipelines. Phil Taylor, General Manager of the
Stephens RSUD, identified these locations in the field. Each trench was approximately 5
meters long and 2 meters wide.
The bore points at the north crossing were trenched at the bore points on the east and
west side of Gonzales Creek (Trench 1 and 2) respectively (Table 1). Trench 1 was
approximately 30 meters from the creek bank and was oriented in a northeast to

soils were mainly smooth, with the majority of them being gradual. The sandy, loamy

each horizon.

Trench 2 was placed on the west side of the creek, approximately 25 meters from the
channel and was oriented in a northwest to southeast direction. The horizons were similar
in description to Trench 1, but varied slightly as the west bank was higher in elevation
then the east bank of the creek. A thin layer of charcoal-stained soil was encountered in
the west side of the trench between 35 -50 cmbs in the A horizon (Figure 9). The west
wall of the trench was scraped and screened, and samples of soil from the trench floor at
50 cmbs, as well as from the backdirt, were also screened. No cultural material was found
associated with the stained soil. Due to the close proximity to the surface and the lack of
artifacts, the charcoal may have been associated with a modern grass fire. One chert core
was found in the back dirt that may have come from the A horizon, yet no other artifacts
or rocks were found from back dirt screened from the same area of the trench. No gravels
were present in the trench matrix or walls and only a few isolated eroded pieces of
sandstone rock from the parent bedrock were in the backfill and sidewalls during
trenching.

Two additional trenches (Trench 3 and 4) were excavated at the bore points for the
pipeline at the southern crossing of Gonzalez Creek (Table 2). Trench 3 was placed on
the east bank of Gonzalez Creek approximately 20 meters from the channel and was
excavated at a northwest to southeast orientation in order to avoid nearby gas pipelines.
The soil was loose and the pasture on the east bank is bisected with several gravel roads
which lead to a nearby natural gas plant. The boundaries between soil horizons were
smooth and gradual, and no gravels were present. The Cr horizon contained dark
yellowish coarse sand mottled with gray clay which was also found at the bottom of the
nearby channel. No bedrock was exposed in the channel, yet the clay appears to have
formed from the parent material and is consistent throughout the immediate area
according to Phil Taylor who had worked in the area for many years.
Inspection of the banks on both sides of the proposed pipeline crossing did not discover
any cultural material (Figure 10). On the west side of Gonzales Creek, there is a closed
gas pump with a lease road leading to it from FM 2231. Trench 4 was placed on the west
side of the creek in a wooded area. A small pile of bricks and concrete, approximately 2
meters in diameter, was on the surface near the trench. Four types of commercial brick
were present, none marked, and appear to have been manufactured in the 20th century.
The concrete aggregate varied in size therefore was probably from different sources. No
foundations were identified during the survey, and no cultural material was uncovered in
the subsequent trench.

The matrix in Trench 4 on the west side of Gonzales Creek was similar to that of Trench
3, but contained a clearly defined Ap Horizon. Very dark brown grayish brown coarse
sandy clay was encountered between 270 and 290, and was consistent with the clay at the
bottom of the adjacent creek channel. Few pebbles were present, and no cultural material
was recorded in the back dirt or side walls of the trenches.

Conclusions
Although evidence for prehistoric occupation was identified in limited surface scatters
such as the lithic procurement site 41SXXX, no significant cultural resources were
identified in the survey of the proposed waterline routes. The lack of historic cultural
resources is attributed to the fact that the proposed route travels mainly through uplands

outside of the city core that have been utilized primarily for gas production and
agricultural purposes. These areas may have been occupied at one time during the oil
boom in the 1930s, but no evidence remains of this today. Historic sites such as the
Picketville town location and cemetery are south of the proposed waterline route and
closer to the town of Breckenridge.
The southern edge of site 41SE307 is the only evidence of prehistoric occupation in the
area. This and other lag gravel deposits in the area were most likely the source for tool
stones, and the light tan and grey colors of chert identified in the field were similar to
those of the points and arrowheads displayed in the Swenson Memorial Museum. No
cultural material was identified in the trenches despite the potential for sites along the
creek.
Overall the study area has been heavily impacted in the 20th century due to gas
production and development of the town of Breckenridge. Existing pipeline corridors and
gravel lease roads bisect the proposed waterline route, and extensive collecting of
prehistoric artifacts has occurred in the region as evidenced by collections on display at
the local museum.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No significant cultural resources were recorded during the survey of the proposed
sections of the waterline routes with high probability for cultural resources. The
recording of the lithic procurement site 41SE307 contributes to our overall understanding
of how prehistoric occupants utilized readily available natural resources, yet the site does
not meet the eligibility criteria for the NRHP and no further investigations are
recommended at the part of the site within the APE.
We therefore recommend that the Stephens RSUD be allowed to proceed with the
construction of the waterlines and improvements to the pump station without the need of
further cultural resource investigations. In addition, if buried cultural resources are
uncovered during construction of the project, work should cease immediately and
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
