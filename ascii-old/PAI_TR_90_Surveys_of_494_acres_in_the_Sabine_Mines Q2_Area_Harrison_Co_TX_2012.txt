abstract
In 2012, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., performed archeological and historical
resources surveys of 494 acres in the Sabine Mine’s Q2 Area in Harrison County, Texas. The
archeological survey resulted in the discovery of 8 previously unrecorded sites (41HS965–41HS972),
2 of which are prehistoric Native American sites and 6 of which are historic sites. Both Native
American sites are small lithic scatters. The historic sites are small artifact scatters or farmsteads
and house sites. None of the archeological sites are considered eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places under Criterion D. The historical resources survey identified 13 historicage resources; 4 are domestic buildings, 4 are associated outbuildings, 4 are industrial properties,
and 1 is an agricultural resource. None of the historic-age resources are considered eligible for
listing in the National Register under Criteria A–C. No further archeological or historical work is
recommended for the project area. The records and artifacts generated by the project are curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin.

INTRODUCTION

420 ft above mean sea level in the north to 320 ft
along the largest creek.
Upland soils in the area are derived from
weathering of the lower Eocene Wilcox Group,
which was deposited by the Mount Pleasant
Fluvial System as channel and overbank
sediments in a meandering depositional
environment (Fisher and McGowan 1967:105).
Soils in the uplands are light colored and
dominantly loamy or sandy surface layer
(Golden et al. 1994). Sediments associated with
the Mount Pleasant Fluvial System commonly
contain small stream gravels of chert, quartzite,
and silicified wood (Studer 1982).
Harrison County is in the Piney Woods
ecoregion of northeast Texas, where upland
overstory vegetation is dominated by shortleaf
(Pinus echinata) and loblolly (P. taeda) pine
and a variety of deciduous species such as red
oak (Quercus falcata), white oak (Q. alba), post
oak (Q. stellata), and hickory (Carya texana).
Bottomland overstory vegetation typically
consists of sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua),
water oak (Q. nigra), overcup oak (Q. lyrata),
river birch (Betula nigra), American hornbeam
(Carpinus caroliniana), and American elm
(Ulmus ameri-cana). Due to such diversity, the
Piney Woods support a rich and varied fauna.
Some of the archeologically more important taxa
are white-tailed deer, rabbits, squirrels, raccoon,
beaver, turtles, an assortment of fish, and a
variety of birds and migratory waterfowl.

This report details results of archeological
and historical investigations conducted for the
North American Coal Corporation–Sabine Mine
in the eastern portion of the mine in Harrison
County, Texas (Figure 1). These investigations
were performed by Prewitt and Associates, Inc.,
in June 2012 and consisted of archeological
and historical resources surveys for cultural
resources on 494 acres in the Mine’s Q2 Area,
immediately south of Marshall, Texas. The work
was done to assist the mine in complying with
the requirements of Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended.
The archeological survey resulted in the
discovery of 8 previously unrecorded sites,
2 of which are prehistoric Native American
sites and 6 of which are historic sites. Both
Native American sites are small lithic scatters.
The historic sites are small artifact scatters
or farmsteads and house sites. The historical
resources survey identified 13 historic-age
resources; 4 are domestic buildings, 4 are
associated outbuildings, 4 are industrial
properties, and 1 is an agricultural resource.
PROJECT AREA LOCATION AND
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area lies within the Sabine
River drainage basin, approximately 9 km north
of the current floodplain of the Sabine River. It
consists of approximately 494 acres bounded
roughly by Interstate Highway 20 to the north,
U.S. Highway 59 to the east, and Liberty Church
Road to the south. The northwestern boundary is
partially adjacent to a 2,373-acre area surveyed
in 2008 by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Norment
et al. 2010). The remaining western boundary
is defined by areas previously surveyed by
others.
Overall, the project area can be described
as undulating to gently rolling upland terrain
dissected by the ephemeral headwaters of
several unnamed tributaries that flow generally
eastward to Eightmile Creek, a major tributary
of the Sabine River. Most of these streams exhibit
incised channels with little to no floodplain. The
only recognizable floodplain is in the southcentral portion of the project area along the
largest tributary. Elevations range from around

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The Sabine Mine has been the scene of the
most intensive and extensive archeological work
done north of the Sabine River in this part of east
Texas. Table 1 lists the various investigations
(see Norment et al. [2010:19–34] for a summary).
Additionally, there has been recent survey work
done at the proposed Marshall Mine, southeast
of Sabine Mine on the north edge of the Sabine
River floodplain (Griffith et al. 2012). In recent
years, survey and some testing has been done
south of the river in Panola and Rusk Counties
as the Sabine Mine has expanded into that area
(Dockall and Fields 2011; Dockall et al. 2010).
Other archeological work south of the river
includes numerous investigations at Martin
Lake Mine and Oak Hill Mine (see Dockall et al.
[2010:25–29] for a summary).

ARCHEOLOGICAL
BACKGROUND

following: (1) high selectivity in tool types with
carefully fashioned bifaces and unifaces being
especially common; (2) extensive curation,
refurbishing, and recycling of tools; frequent
use of high-quality, often nonlocal, lithic
materials; a near-absence of tools and facilities
indicative of plant processing; and (3) broad
distributions of particular artifact styles. Based
on these characteristics, Story speculates that
Paleoindian adaptations in northeastern Texas
involved high residential mobility and large
territories, short-lived occupations by small
groups at individual sites, low population
densities and hence little competition for
resources. There was a generalized subsistence
strategy focusing on hunting rather than plant
collecting, and fluidity in group composition and
movement as a means of avoiding or resolving
economic or social problems.
The remains of occupations by Archaic
groups (6000–200 b.c.), particularly late Archaic
peoples, are abundant in northeastern Texas,
although a complete sequence of artifact styles
and assemblages has yet to be developed. ­Accord­

Investigations by both avocational and
professional archeologists over the years have
identified many important sites in the middle
Sabine basin and revealed that the region
has had a long and complex history of use by
Native Americans. ­ Occupation of the larger
northeast Texas area during the Paleoindian
period (10,000–6,000 b.c.) is demonstrated by
the frequent, if not abundant, occurrence of
projectile points such as Clovis, Dalton, San
Patrice, and Scottsbluff and other distinctive
tools like Albany scrapers, Red River knives,
and Dalton adzes (Story 1990:177) at sites
such as John Pearce in Caddo Parish just east
of Harrison County (Webb et al. 1971), Jake
Martin in Upshur County (Davis and Davis
1960), and Forrest Murphey in Marion County
(Story 1990:180). Story (1990:177; Story et al.
1990:425–426) observes that Paleoindian sites
typically contain limited amounts of refuse,
and their assemblages are marked by the
?

ing to Story (1990:213; Story et al. 1990:426),
Archaic period sites are characterized by greater
quantities of refuse and the appearance of tools
and facilities suggestive of plant processing.
Functionally diverse tool assemblages containing
relatively large proportions of expedient tools are
commonplace, and tool curation and recycling are
observed less frequently when compared to the
Paleoindian period. Distinctive regional artifact
styles begin to emerge, as well as new cultural
practices, such as the appear­ance of cemeteries.
From these observations, Story suggests
that Archaic period adaptations in­volved the
seasonal foraging and hunting of a wide variety
of resources, with plant foods becoming of greater
importance. Exploitation patterns became more
intensive and more focused geographically
than during the Paleoindian period. Better
defined and less-extensive group territories
led to decreased residential mobility and less
direct access to nonlocal materials, resulting
in trade relationships as a means of solving
economic and social problems. Although Archaic
artifacts are common in the region, excavated
sites that are predominantly Archaic in age
or where Archaic components can be isolated
from later components are rare. Excavated sites
with Archaic components in the region include
Jake Martin in Upshur County (Davis and
Davis 1960), Yarbrough in Van Zandt County
(Johnson 1962), Finley Fan in Hopkins County
(Gadus et al. 1992), Tankersley Creek in Titus
County (Young 1981), 41BW422 in Bowie County
(Tucker 1994), Oak Hill Village in Rusk County
(Rogers and Perttula 2004), and 41HS74 and
Resch in Harrison County (Heartfield, Price and
Greene, Inc. 1988; Webb et al. 1969).
The Woodland period (200 b.c.–a.d. 800)
­covers the ca. 1,000-year span preceding the
appearance of the Caddo culture. Therefore,
it is pivotal to understanding this important
cultural development in northeastern Texas. The
origins of the Caddo culture have been debated
for many years, but Story’s (1990) synthesis
of the archeology of the region suggests that
speakers of Caddoan languages occupied the
area before the development of a recognizable
Caddo archeological tradition. The adoption of
maize agriculture did not trigger the Caddo
florescence, and early Caddo culture was
influenced by, but did not develop out of, Lower
Mississippi Valley cultures. Thus, according to
Story (1990:293), “there can be little doubt that

the emergence of a distinctive southern Caddoan
archeological tradition was basically an in situ
development within resident communities of
Caddoan speakers.”
Perttula (1990:Part I, 70–97) suggests that
there was substantial continuity in subsistence
strategies from the late Archaic period through
the early half of the Caddo period. This includes
increased use of ­domesticated cucurbits, bottle
gourds, and ­native plants with oily and starchy
seeds, such as sumpweed, Chenopodium,
maygrass, knotweed, and sunflower. Although
tropical cultigens were ­ introduced during
this time and were present across the Caddo
region by ca. a.d. 1000, the development of
true agroecological systems, and the resulting
adoption of vastly different subsistence
strategies, did not occur until later, probably
after a.d. 1200 (Perttula 1990:Part I, 97). While
the idea of local origins for the Caddo culture is
likely to hold up under further ­scrutiny, there are
limited data from excavated, discrete Woodland
sites in the northeast Texas region with which
to evaluate this hypothesis. One of the moreimportant excavated sites dating to this interval,
the Resch site (Webb et al. 1969), is situated on
Potters Creek not far southwest of the current
survey area, and it is likely that the valleys of the
major Sabine River tributaries saw substantial
occupations during this time.
There is ample evidence for intensive
occupation of the middle Sabine basin during the
Caddo period (a.d. 800–1680). Perttula (1994)
identifies a number of mound sites representing
civic-ceremonial centers, including six in parts
of Harrison, Panola, and Rusk Counties near
the current survey area, and it is certain that
the remains of many hamlets and small villages
are scattered around these mound centers. One
of these mound centers, the recently excavated
Pine Tree Mound site (41HS15), is just 4.5 km
west of the survey area (Fields and Gadus 2012).
One of the most important excavated residential
sites in northeastern Texas, the Oak Hill Village
site (Rogers and Perttula 2004), is in Rusk
County, southwest of the project area. Temporal
patterns are not fully ­defined, but the evidence
points to especially intensive occupation of this
part of the Sabine basin during the middle and
latter parts of the Caddo period. Also present in
the area are a number of early historic Caddo
sites (Jones 1968; Webb et al. 1969:7–9), and
Fields and Gadus (2012) argue that these, along
?

with the earlier Pine Tree Mound site, represent
occupations by Nadaco Caddo groups.

few in number relative to yeoman or tenant
farmers. By 1860, plantation owners with larger
landholdings comprised less than 15 percent
of the county’s population, and planters with
smaller holdings comprised about 11 percent.
Yeoman farmers constituted about 40 percent.
Tenant farmers, a declining group in antebellum
Harrison County, were lowest on the economic
ladder, renting land or supporting themselves as
farm laborers (Campbell 1983:32–33).
Overland and waterway transportation
routes that traversed the region figured
prominently in Harrison County. Goods were
shipped on the Red River to Shreveport, Port
Caddo on Caddo Lake, or along Cypress Bayou
to Jefferson (Armstrong 1926:2). The Sabine and
Red Rivers via Caddo Lake were primary routes
for shipping cotton to markets. Marshall Railway
and Plank Road Company was chartered in
1850. In addition to Trammel’s Trace, two other
trails crossed Harrison County: an extension
of the Spanish Trail and Dayton’s Road (Lentz
1957:250). Equine-drawn stagecoach and oxdrawn freight lines connected Marshall with
Jefferson, Tyler, and Shreveport (Marshall
National Bank 1959). The Camden-to-Shreveport
Stagecoach Road was a main transportation
artery before the Civil War. Shreveport, via
the Mississippi River, linked with the port in
New Orleans and distant domestic and foreign
markets for local farmers to export their cash
crops. The Vicksburg and El Paso Railway, also
known as the Texas Western Railroad, began
construction on a branch between Marshall
and Caddo Lake in 1856 that would link with
the Vicksburg, Shreveport and Texas Railroad
and the state line. Twenty-seven miles were
in operation at the time of secession (Lentz
1957:250; Richardson and White 1940:990–991).
By the early 1860s, large farms clustered east
and southeast of Marshall, along the roads
to Shreveport and Elysian Fields. Numerous
smaller farms were south and west of Marshall,
generally along established roads to Carthage,
Henderson, Camden, and Earpville. Along the
road to Carthage just east of the current project
area, Liberty Church had been established by
1863 (Von Rosenberg 1863).
Harrison County played an important
role in the Confederacy during the Civil War.
Marshall was home to several leaders, hosted
important wartime conferences, and became a
center for the Trans-Mississippi Department’s

HisTORICAL BACKGROUND
When the Republic of Texas was founded
in 1836, the leadership lifted land restrictions,
and an abundance of affordable land enticed
new residents, including some in the study
area. The Republic issued certificates to Anglo
Americans, including first-class land grants to
Pennington Lindsey and Jackson Page in 1838.
The northern 145 acres of the current project
area are in the Page Survey, and the southern
349 acres are in the Lindsey Survey. Lindsey, a
native of Louisiana, and Page, a native of North
Carolina, both came to Texas in 1834 (Texas
General Land Office 1848, 1857). The Lindsey
and Page Surveys were both patented after
statehood—the 2,697.63-acre Lindsey Survey
in 1848 and the adjacent 320-acre Page Survey
in 1857 (Texas General Land Office 1848, 1857).
Both men owned other lands in Texas (Texas
General Land Office 1859, 1860a, 1860b, 1861,
1885). Page had sold his certificate to Joshua T.
Gill, whose heirs received the patent and likely
did not occupy the property (Texas General
Land Office 1857). By 1840, Lindsey owned
more than 4,000 acres in Harrison County, all of
which was appraised at $1 an acre. He occupied
this survey with his family until about 1850
(Harrison County, Ad Valorem Tax Records;
U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office
1850a). The family moved to Wood County and
later to McLennan County (Harrison County,
Deed Record N:119; U.S. Department of the
Interior, Census Office 1860a).
Agriculture was embedded as Harrison
County’s foremost economic activity, and
antebellum socioeconomic conditions typical
of those across most of the American South
resonated locally. In 1850, Harrison County
was the most-populated county in the state. Of
the county’s 11,822 people, 6,213 (52 percent)
were slaves (DeBow 1854:308, 314). By 1860,
Harrison County still was one of the mostpopulated counties in Texas, and its agricultural
economy thrived. The county had 15,000
inhabitants, of which 59 percent were slaves
(Campbell 1989:110–114; U.S. Department
of the Interior, Census Office 1864:475, 481,
485). Although planters with large and small
holdings controlled the local economy, they were
?

medical bureau, postal service, two hospitals,
and commissary bureau (Campbell 2012a, 2012b;
Lentz 1957:252; Texas Historical Commission
1963a, 1963b). The county’s transportation
routes had expanded by the eve of the Civil War,
when eight stagecoach lines and a network of
roads linked Marshall to other communities,
large and small. A 16-mile stretch of railroad was
the only serviceable track in the entire state by
1863 (Campbell 1983:85; Richardson and White
1940:991; Texas Historical Commission 1979).
Local manufacturing was relatively
uncommon at mid century, but the war changed
that for Marshall and Harrison County. An
ordnance bureau, depot, laboratory, and arsenal
produced many goods to aid the war effort.
Clothing, hats, shoes, saddles, harnesses, guns,
and ammunition were manufactured locally
(Texas Historical Commission 1963a, 1963b,
1976a). High-quality fur felt from a plant near
Hallsville was shipped to the Confederate hat
factory in Marshall. About 40 men blocked and
finished hats and made blankets and saddle
blankets for troops and their horses (Texas
Historical Commission 1976b). An ammunition
factory, locally known as the Powder Mill, was
a few miles northwest of Marshall on Graves
Creek. The fortified factory began operation in
1863 (Harrison County Historical Museum 1971;
Lentz 1957:252; Texas Historical Commission
1988).
In the study area, native-Virginian Josiah
Marshall had acquired the Page Survey in 1857,
and within a few years’ time he had lucrative
manufacturing enterprises on the property
(Harrison County, Deed Record P:564). Marshall,
a wealthy lawyer, entrepreneur, politician, editor,
and slaveholding plantation owner, had served
in the Texas House of Representatives from
1853 to 1855. His conservative views remained
constant, and he expressed them through
the evolution of political parties of the time.
He was an “ultra, states-rights Whig” when
elected, played a leadership role in the shortlived nativistic Know-Nothing Party, and was a
unionist editor by 1860 (Legislative Reference
Library of Texas 2012). Marshall owned almost
2,000 acres out of three surveys in the county
valued at $5,800 and three lots in Marshall. He
held 39 slaves valued at $22,000, 17 horses, 54
cattle, and $1,045 in miscellaneous property. It is
unlikely that he occupied the Page Survey, which
was valued at $800, since one of his town lots was

heavily improved. His slaveholdings increased
to 50 in 1858. That year he had oxen, a wagon,
and miscellaneous property valued at $1,125,
and an office in Marshall (Harrison County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records 1857). He held $30,000 in
real estate and $30,000 in personal estate in
1860 (U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1860a). During the Civil War, Marshall
owned between 2,700 and 3,700 acres of land
out of several surveys in Harrison County, along
with valuable lots in Marshall. He held between
50 and 57 slaves during the conflict. His livestock
annually included at least 19 equine, 50 bovine,
and 65 sheep (Harrison County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records 1861, 1862, 1863, 1864). In 1860,
he lived in town with his Mississippi-born wife,
their four children, and a 60-year-old gentleman
(Harrison County, Ad Valorem Tax Records 1857,
1859, 1861, 1862, 1863, 1864; U.S. Department
of the Interior, Census Office 1860a). That
year, he had a sawmill valued at $1,000 with
$2,300 in raw materials and three employees
who drew a total monthly wage of $60. There,
900,000 ft of lumber valued at $10,000 were
manufactured between 1859 and 1860. He also
had a gristmill valued at $2,000 with $10,000 in
raw materials and three employees who drew a
total monthly wage of $60. The gristmill ground
11,500 bushels of corn worth $11,500 into meal
(Johnson 1996). When he sold the Page Survey
in 1865, it was the location of a tanyard, shoe
shop, and distillery (Harrison County, Deed
Record T:656). The following year, the survey
had the mills and distillery, a steam engine,
bailers, flour mill, cotton gin and press, and
blacksmith tools (Harrison County, Deed Record
V1:464). The locations of these improvements
are unknown, although the mills were likely on
the east side of the Marshall-to-Carthage Road
(Von Rosenberg 1863).
Although Harrison County escaped violence
and occupation during the war, the postbellum
era brought radical changes that included federal
occupation and the tumult of Reconstruction
(Lentz 1957:253). After the Civil War, about
two-thirds of Harrison County’s population were
freedmen with new legal rights. Every precinct
in the county had an African American majority
(U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office
1872). Several hundred freedmen’s settlements
came into being in Texas between 1870 and 1890,
and Harrison County was home to several of these
communities. Often, groups of freed blacks would
?

settle along county lines, up in the sand hills, or
down in the creek and river bottoms, in “places
unplatted and unincorporated, individually
unified only by church and school and residents’
collective belief that a community existed.”
Known freedmen’s communities in Harrison
County included Hughes Springs, Leigh, Lott,
Nesbitt, and Piney, all outside the study area
(Sitton and Conrad 2005:2, 194). Liberty Church
was a likely community center for local African
American families. Just outside the study area
at the intersection of the Liberty Church and
Marshall-to-Carthage Roads, an Anglo American
church was present by 1863 (Von Rosenberg
1863). In 1867, the landowner conveyed a 4-acre
parcel out of the Lindsey Survey to be dedicated
to the Liberty Church (Harrison County, Deed
Record V:159). A school, no longer extant, had
been part of the community at one time, and the
Liberty Cemetery, noted as African American,
is on the east side of the highway (Cook 2012;
Tobin International 1935, 1961).
Even with the efforts of the Freedman’s
Bureau, African Americans were hard-pressed
to realize independence in the postbellum era.
In 1870, about 75 percent of Harrison County’s
African Americans were farm laborers and only
3.5 percent were farmers, as compared with
the local Anglo American population, of which
55 percent were farmers and only 4.5 percent
were farm laborers. On average, the Anglo
American population had $1,415 in real estate
and $527 in personal property; this is in marked
contrast to African Americans, who had a mere
$10 in real estate and $19 in personal property.
Although more African Americans had at least
one child aged 5 to 17 (65 percent) than did
their Anglo American neighbors (55 percent),
their children were substantially less likely to
go to school. Only 5 percent of these children
attended school, as compared with 44 percent of
Anglo American children (Campbell 1983:301).
No land, no money, and no access to education
tested the wherewithal of African Americans in
the late nineteenth century.
Nevertheless, a few African Americans
bought farms in the study area within a decade
of emancipation. In 1870, Peter Shaw Sr. owned
a 100-acre farm (41HS965) out of the Lindsey
Survey. That year, he lived on the land with his
wife, Sarah Jane Davis, and a young daughter.
None of the family could read or write, and, with
the exception of an eight-year-old son and two-

year-old daughter, the entire family worked as
farm hands. A female farm hand, Rose Taylor,
also resided with the family (U.S. Department
of the Interior, Census Office 1870). The Taylors
typically had a few work animals, such as horses
or mules, and milch cows and hogs to provide
dairy and meat (Harrison County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records 1880, 1884, 1885, 1890). In 1880,
three Shaw families were living together, likely
on the 100-acre parcel that Peter Shaw Sr.
owned, since the other adults did not own land
at the time. Shaw Sr. had remarried by 1880
and was living with his young wife Rose, Pierce
and Palace Shaw, Andrew (1853–1925) and Lucy
Shaw (1857–1922), and a total of 10 children.
His relationship with Pierce Shaw is unclear,
but Andrew was one of Shaw Sr.’s several sons.
Nearby were the families of William and America
Shaw and Frank and Anna Shaw (Harrison
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records 1880, 1884,
Rakoczy 2011a, 2011b; U.S. Department of the
Interior, Census Office 1880). The property had
easy access to the Marshall-to-Carthage Road to
the east via the east-west southern portion of a
loop road. A road connecting the loop road with
Liberty Church Road to the south traversed the
center of the property extending southwesterly
(Van Duyne and Byers 1913).
After the initial postbellum economic
collapse, both the local population and agricultural
production rebounded in Harrison County. By
the turn of the century, African Americans had
improved their circumstances dramatically.
Of major consequence were advancements in
educational conditions and occupational status.
As was true 10 years earlier, more African
American families had at least one child aged 5
to 17 (69 percent) than did their Anglo American
neighbors (57 percent), and their children were
still substantially less likely to go to school.
Nevertheless, the likelihood of school attendance
had increased markedly to 26 percent, while
that for Anglo American children had declined
slightly to about 42 percent. Illiteracy would
remain an impediment for the adult African
American population, of which about 80 percent
could neither read nor write. By this time, the
initial postwar trend toward farm laboring had
reversed, and only about 16 percent were farm
laborers and 56 percent were farmers (Campbell
1983:367).
More African Americans owned land in
Harrison County by the turn of the century,
10

relying upon family relationships to foster
their farm operations. Former slaves George
Robert Sr. and Flora Ann Brown Hale owned
an 80-acre parcel by 1880. That year, the Hales
had two children, Jonas and Susan, who each
worked as laborers, and a widower and farmer
Joe Hale and a widow, Mary Hale, George Robert
Sr.’s mother, also lived with the family. Nearby
was Flora Ann Brown Hale’s widowed mother,
Lucy Brown, who worked as a farmer and had
a laborer daughter and infant granddaughter
living with her. All of these adults were illiterate
(Harrison County, Deed Record 218:298; U.S.
Department of the Interior, Census Office 1880).
The family generally had a wagon and a few
head of equine, bovine, and swine (Harrison
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records 1884, 1890,
1895, 1900, 1905, 1910). By 1900, the Hales were
farming and had their two youngest children,
Hannah and George Robert Jr., both of whom
attended school, and her mother living with
them (U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1900). Phillip Warren, who was born into
slavery, purchased about 100 acres in the study
area in 1895 and operated a farm (41HS966)
there until 1922 (Harrison County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records 1895, 1900, 1905, 1910, 1915, 1920;
Harrison County, Deed Records 33:265, 47:408,
125:53). In 1900, Warren’s cousin Nancy Shaw,
her husband, and their two children lived with
him (U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1900). In 1899, Henry and Eliza Ann
Taylor purchased 25 acres for their homestead
(41HS968/Resource 7) (Harrison County, Deed
Records 36:375, 49:238). He had been born a
slave in Tennessee in 1835; his wife had been
born in Texas in 1868. They had married in 1885
and had 10 children living with them by 1900.
Although their parents were illiterate, the 3
oldest children attended school and also worked
as farm laborers (U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1900). The Shaw, Hale, and Taylor
families owned their properties for decades.
Heirship sustained familial associations with
the land, but each family gradually abandoned
living on their rural properties.
Another property in the study area that was
in a single family from 1857 until 1937 belonged
to Thomas Jefferson and Margaret Eugenia
Coleman Whaley (Harrison County, Deed Record
P:328). Tenants likely occupied the property
for some time, since the Whaley homestead
was nearby until at least 1880, and by 1900,

they resided in Marshall (Harrison County
Historical Museum n.d.; U.S. Department of
Commerce and Labor, Bureau of the Census
1910; U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1880, 1900; Von Rosenberg 1863). By 1910,
the Whaleys had acquired a total of 571 acres
out of the Lindsey Survey, an adjacent 50 acres
out of the Ramsdale Survey, and three lots in
Marshall, including their residence (Harrison
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records 1910). In
1911, Whaley died and his widow inherited the
land. In December 1919, Margaret Eugenia
Coleman Whaley conveyed her land out of the
Lindsey Survey to the Whaley Farm Corporation
(Harrison County, Deed Record 106:195). By
1935, a house (41HS971/Resource 2A) and
outbuildings were present, and the nearby
agricultural fields (Resource 2B) were terraced
(Tobin International 1935). The farmstead had
easy access to the Marshall-to-Carthage Road
to the east via the east-west northern portion
of a loop road. From it, another road extended
northwesterly (Van Duyne and Byers 1913).
William C. Deason Sr. purchased the property in
1937 and lived there for many years (Harrison
County, Deed Record 22:402). In 1940, he lived on
the farmstead with his wife Myrtle, two sons, and
a daughter and son-in-law. The farm was valued
at $1,500. He was a coach builder, and his son-inlaw likely operated the farm (U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1940). The
house, heavily altered, remains extant.
Economic change during the twentieth
century permanently transformed Harrison
County’s landscape. Manufacturing
establishments in and near Marshall employed
approximately 2,000 workers in nonagricultural
positions by 1930. The county had a population of
48,937 that year, nearly one-third of whom lived
in Marshall, representing a huge shift to town
living (Campbell 2012a). Early natural gas and
oil exploration in east Texas led to construction
of pipelines (Resource 8) that threaded the
area. To support local industry and meet
rural electrification needs, transmission lines
(Resources 4 and 5) crisscrossed the countryside.
Development of this infrastructure, in tandem
with subdivision of land near but outside of
Marshall, led to sporadically placed “ranchettes,”
each with a small amount of land, a house,
and various outbuildings. An early example
of a ranchette is a ca. 1940 house (Resource 3)
on a small wedge of land extracted from the
11

larger Deason farm. Although its original form
and stylistic influence are no longer apparent,
the side-gable roof and sets of paired windows
on each façade hint that the house was built
before World War II. A later example (Resource
1A), built in about 1958, also on a small parcel
sliced from the Deason farm, employs a modest
rendition of the contemporaneously popular
Minimal Traditional architectural style. This
style has only the barest ornamentation that
mimics classical or colonial revival detailing. In
proximity are several small modest outbuildings
(Resources 1B–E). More active exploration for
natural gas took hold after World War II. As a
result, tank batteries (Resource 6) began to dot
the landscape.

cultural materials were recovered, additional
shovel tests were dug nearby to identify site
boundaries and examine artifact densities
within sites. Each shovel test was assigned a
unique number according to the excavator, and
general descriptions of the soil color, texture, and
depth were recorded for all tests, as well as any
materials recovered.
At least six shovel tests were excavated at
each site, except in one case where most of the
landform on which the site sits extends beyond
the project boundary. In all, 76 shovel tests were
excavated to investigate eight sites, ranging
from 5 to 15 tests per site.
Mapping was done using several different
global positioning systems (GPS). The GPS units
were used to record each shovel test location, site
locations, and other notable features. All data
were converted into shapefiles to display spatial
information within a GIS environment. This
enabled the spatial information collected in the
field to be overlaid onto digitized, georeferenced
topographic maps and aerial photographs
showing the survey area boundaries.
To help identify potentially important
historic archeological sites, historic maps and
aerial photographs were analyzed (Table 2;
Figure 2). The sources used were a detailed 1863
map of the area (Von Rosenberg 1863); a 1913
soils map of Harrison County (Van Duyne and
Byers 1913); sets of aerial photographs taken
in 1935, 1949, and 1961 (Tobin International
1935, 1961; U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service 1949); and a 1958 USGS topographic
map (U.S. Department of the Interior, Geological
Survey 1958). The 1863 map shows that the area
was sparsely settled at the time, with evidence of
cropland in the project area and Liberty Church
and Marshall Mill nearby to the east. By 1913,
several roads traversing the study area had
been established; only one house was mapped,
though. The 1935 aerial photographs show
six complexes of buildings representing small
farms, houses, or outbuildings. Later sources
show three additional buildings representing
mid-twentieth-century development. These
three were considered too recent to treat
as archeological sites, but the other seven
potential sites were visited and shovel tested
when appropriate. Four were found to contain
archeological remains and were recorded as
sites. No archeological evidence was found at

archeological survey
METHODOLOGY
Archeological fieldwork was conducted by a
four-person crew over a single 10-day field session
and involved intensive pedestrian coverage of
the project area. Originally, the project area
extended eastward to the mine permit boundary
and covered a total of 558 acres, but a 64-acre
area along the very northeastern boundary was
removed from the disturbance area due to the
number of businesses on those properties. As a
result, the project area became 494 acres.
Pedestrian survey consisted of walking
over the project area at roughly 30-m intervals
and performing visual inspection of the ground
surface. In most areas, the ground surface was
not visible, and subsurface testing was done.
Subsurface investigation was accomplished
through shovel testing. A total of 310 shovel tests
were excavated within the 494 acres surveyed,
resulting in 1 shovel test per 1.6 acres.
In general, shovel testing was conducted
on level uplands and midslope benches that
still retain sediment, on benches and terraces
adjacent to creeks, and, in a few instances, within
the floodplain of the creek. Steep slopes (greater
than 20 percent grade) and highly eroded or
disturbed areas typically did not warrant shovel
testing. Shovel tests were excavated in arbitrary
20-cm levels for vertical control and measured
roughly 30 cm in diameter. Shovel tests were
excavated either to 100 cm below surface or
to clay subsoil where possible. All sediments
were screened through 1/4-inch-mesh hardware
cloth and examined for cultural material. When

one location, and two others are too disturbed
to contain sites.
After fieldwork, archival research specific
to the identified historic archeological sites
was performed to prepare site histories and an
abbreviated historical background particular
to these sites. This effort began with reviewing
historical backgrounds for previously studied
areas nearby (Dockall et al. 2008:28–31; Dockall
et al. 2010:38–55; Griffith et al. 2012:31–64;
Norment 2010:42–57; Wilder et al. 2007:27–32).
These earlier investigations provide thorough
historical backgrounds that chronologically
address pertinent contexts, such as agriculture,
community development, industry, and African
American ethnic heritage. Since these topics and
periods—early settlement and the antebellum
years, Harrison County and the Civil War, the
postbellum years, and the twentieth century—
are common to the current study area, repetition
is not necessary herein. Instead, relevant text
is excerpted from the previous analyses, and a
brief synthesis of archival sources particular to
the historic archeological sites identified in this
study area is presented.
Archival research contributed details about
each historic archeological site in the study
area. Records at the Texas General Land Office
gave evidence of original survey notes for land
grants on which these sites are situated and
chronicled transfers of land from the State of
Texas to private citizens (Texas General Land
Office 1848, 1857). Chains of title that American
Electric Power supplied for each land parcel on
which a site is situated documented ownership

Harrison County, Probate Records). This research
provided ownership information, with some
exceptions, for the sites from the date of patent
to present. Not all transactions, unfortunately,
were recorded with the county clerk, so it was
not possible to ascertain ownership for some
years. Ad valorem county tax records for the
years 1846 to 1940 at the Texas State Library
and Archives confirmed ownership and indicated
valuation of real property over time, plus that
for slaveholdings, livestock, and other personal
property (Harrison County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records). The presence of livestock suggests land
uses, occupation, and degree of wealth. Heritage
Quest Online supplied information about heads
of households and those who resided with them
from the series of population censuses for each
decennial from 1850 to 1940 (U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1920,
1930, 1940; U.S. Department of Commerce
and Labor, Bureau of the Census 1910; U.S.
Department of the Interior, Census Office 1850a,
1850b, 1860a, 1860b, 1870, 1880, 1900). Details
about household members who occupied these
properties included age, gender, marital status,
number of surviving children and their ages
and genders, occupation, place of birth, and
relationship to the head of household. Aggregate
census data was also collected (DeBow 1854;
U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office
1864, 1872). Internet sources consulted include
the Texas Forestry Museum sawmill database
(Johnson 1996), the Legislative Reference
Library of Texas (Legislative Reference Library

(Harrison County Historical Museum n.d.).

Personnel meeting the Secretary of the
Interior’s professional qualifications standards
conducted the reconnaissance survey of
buildings and structures. Before performing
field investigations, historic maps and aerial
photographs were compared with similar
current materials, and appraisal district
records were consulted for possible dates
of construction (Harrison County, Central
Appraisal District). The reconnaissance survey
consisted of driving and walking the vicinity and
adjacent and intersecting side roads to become
familiar with the study area. Since there was
potential to identify historic districts, personnel
examined the study area and its surrounds for
clusters of historic-age resources that could be
considered eligible for the National Register as
a collection.
The reconnaissance survey included
photographic and resource-specific
documentation. With some exceptions, at least
two digital photographs (2,816x2,112-pixel
resolution minimum) were taken of each identified
historic-age building, structure, and landscape
feature. Personnel recorded information about
each resource to develop an inventory by number
that includes name, location (by street address
or Universal Transverse Mercator coordinates),
property type and subtype, stylistic influence,
known or estimated construction date, integrity
assessments, and National Register eligibility
recommendation. Historical resources survey
forms with photographs are in the appendix.
Two resources were documented both as historic
resources and archeological sites (Resource
2, also recorded as 41HS971; Resource 7, also
recorded as 41HS968).
Limitations hampered photographic and
field investigations for some resources but
did not prevent adequate documentation. It
was problematic to capture quality images of
resources with overgrown foliage or fences that
obscured views (Resources 2A and 7). Linear
resources, such as electric transmission lines
(Resources 4 and 5) and pipelines (Resource 8),
were cumbersome to document. In these cases,
historic and current aerial photographs provide
better overall views than horizontal or vertical
photographs that limit peripheral views of these
expansive resources. Despite these limitations,
each resource was sufficiently documented to
make definitive National Register eligibility
recommendations.

historical resources
survey methodology
Tasks associated with historical resources
studies included performing a file search and
literature review of secondary materials,
completion of a reconnaissance survey of
historic-age buildings and structures, and
analysis of the data collected. The file search
guided identification of known historicage resources in and near the study area.
Information was gathered from the Texas
Historical Commission’s Texas Historic Sites
Atlas files on National Historic Landmarks,
National Register properties, Official Texas
Historical Markers (Recorded Texas Historic
Landmarks, subject markers, and Texas
C e n t e n n i a l m a r k e r s ) , c e m e t e r i e s, a n d
neighborhood surveys; the Texas Department of
Agriculture Family Land Heritage records; and
the National Park Service’s Historic American
Buildings Survey and Historic American
Engineering Record.
The literature review guided identification
of appropriate contexts within which to evaluate
the significance of historic-age resources in the
study area. The literature review also guided
identification of potential property types
associated with these historic contexts and
indicated the likelihood of extant historic-age
resources. Secondary sources included books and
articles pertinent to the study area (Armstrong
1926; Campbell 1983; Campbell 1989; Lentz
1957; Marshall National Bank 1959; Richardson
and White 1940; Sitton and Conrad 2005) and on
the Internet (Campbell 2012a, 2012b; Cook 2012;
Texas Historical Commission 1963a, 1963b,
1976a, 1976b, 1979, 1988). Aerial photographs
available from Tobin International and the
Texas Natural Resources Information System,
U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps, and
map collections at the Texas State Library and
Archives were reviewed (Texas State Highway
Department 1940, 1961; Tobin International
1935, 1961; U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service 1949; U.S. Department of the Interior,
Geological Survey 1858; Van Duyne and Byers
1913; Von Rosenberg 1863).

On completion of the reconnaissance survey
of buildings and structures, each identified
historic-age resource was evaluated to make
recommendations regarding National Register
eligibility. National Register recommendations
are the result of synthesizing contextual
research and field investigations. Relevant
cultural resources management publications
guided analysis of the historic-age resources
(Andrus and Shrimpton 2002; U.S. Department
of the Interior, National Park Service 1997).
Each resource’s integrity was evaluated for
the possibility of both individual eligibility and
contributing to a potential historic district.
Registration requirements were developed to
assess of each resource’s integrity of location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, and association. An explicit discussion
of registration requirements and integrity is
included in the section reporting the results
of the survey, and integrity issues particular
to each resource are noted on the historical
resources survey forms in the appendix to this
report.

prehistoric lithic scatters. Sites 41HS965,
41HS968, 41HS971, and 41HS972 are late
nineteenth- to twentieth-century farmsteads
or house sites. Sites 41HS966 and 41HS967
are scatters of twentieth-century artifacts
representing a possible farm outbuilding and
a trash deposit.
Site 41HS965
Description
Site 41HS965 is a sparse historic artifact
scatter, perhaps representing a late-nineteenth
or early-twentieth-century house site, situated
on an upland slope in the south-central portion
of the survey area (Figure 3). The site is at
elevations between 380 and 390 ft, and the
closest water source is a small unnamed creek
ca. 310 m to the south. The land surrounding
the site is covered in dense regrowth of pine
forest, yaupons, greenbriers, and a variety of
other small plants and shrubs. Ground surface
visibility is less than 10 percent. The mostrecent activity in the vicinity is the construction
of three well pads and a related road, which
passes along the south side of the site.
The site is not apparent on any historic
maps or aerial photographs of the area. A
road north of the site extended west from the
Marshall-to-Carthage Road (present-day U.S.
Highway 59), looping north and then east back
to the highway, as early as 1913. From this
road, another extended southwesterly to Liberty
Church Road west of the site. The 1935 aerial
photograph shows that the area was a plowed
field, with wooded areas to the east, west, and
north and pasture to the northwest. Subsequent
aerial photographs show this land gradually
transforming from cropland to pastureland to
dense mixed hardwood forest.
Nine shovel tests were excavated in the
immediate area of the site, three of which yielded
historic materials at depths of 0–40 cm (Figure
4; Table 3). All tests reached the Bt horizon
at depths of 16–48 cm, averaging 29 cm. The
materials recovered consist of three whiteware
fragments (one of which is a rim), three cut
nail fragments, four clear glass fragments, and
one brown glass fragment. In addition, a single
salt-glazed stoneware vessel base fragment
was found on the surface in a cleared area
along the well road, which prompted shovel

SURVEY AREA DESCriPTION
The survey area is a mix of wooded and
open areas. Over the years, it has experienced
a series of land use transformations from
farming and cattle ranching to oil and natural
gas production and clay extraction. The most
common disturbances observed are the result of
well pad construction, clay pit excavation, and
logging. Eleven well pads were observed within
the survey area and are spaced throughout.
There are three large borrow areas where clay
has been excavated, most likely for the Marshall
Pottery, and several tracts show signs of recent
logging and tree regrowth. In the cleared and
logged areas, large push piles of rotting timber
are scattered across the landscape. Other parts
of the area contain new house sites and other
construction, as the project area is on the
southern outskirts of the city of Marshall, and
its eastern edge traverses parcels that front onto
U.S. Highway 59.
Results of the

The survey identified eight archeological
sites. Sites 41HS969 and 41HS970 are

Pennington Lindsey, a native of Louisiana,
came to Texas as early as 1834 (Texas General
Land Office 1848). The Shelby County board
of land commissioners issued him a first-class
land grant for one league and one labor of land
in February 1838. The district surveyor located
the land in Harrison County for Lindsey in 1847,
and the State of Texas issued him a patent for
this survey on March 17, 1848 (Texas General
Land Office 1848). Lindsey owned other land
certificates that would be patented as a 320-acre
survey in Cooke County and a 640-acre survey
in Archer County in 1861 to assignee John C.
Marshall (Texas General Land Office 1848,
1859, 1861). By 1850, Lindsey owned more than
4,000 acres in Harrison County, all of which was
appraised at $1 an acre. He probably occupied
this survey with his family (Harrison County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records; U.S. Department of
the Interior, Census Office 1850a). In the early
1850s, Lindsey began to divest his landholdings
in Harrison County (Harrison County, Deed
Records K:26, L:154, 434, M:201, N:119). The
family moved to Wood County and lived in
McLennan County by 1860 (Harrison County,
Deed Record N:119; U.S. Department of the
Interior, Census Office 1860a).
In February 1851, Lindsey conveyed
230 acres out of the northeast quadrant of his
survey to E. L. Copeland and James L. Copeland
(Harrison County, Deed Record L:154). Although
no deed records any associated transaction,
sometime between 1851 and 1866, Tennesseeborn William M. Copeland had acquired the
230 acres. Copeland was a single man living
in Harrison County by 1850 when he held
three adult male, one adult female, and five
young slaves, and had $1,800 in real estate
(U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office
1850a, 1850b). By 1860, Copeland was living
with his Alabama-born wife and their young
Texas-born daughter. He held five adult, four
teenage, and six young slaves (U.S. Department
of the Interior, Census Office 1860a, 1860b).
That year, Copeland had 200 improved and
400 unimproved acres valued at $3,600 with
another $250 in farm implements. His livestock
was valued at $1,380 and consisted of working
animals—1 horse, 5 asses and mules, and 5
oxen—and those that provided food—9 milch
cows, 8 beef cattle, 10 sheep, and 80 swine. The
farm produced 1,600 bushels of corn and 40
bales of cotton (U.S. Department of the Interior,

Census Office 1860c). By 1863, Copeland had
cropland to the south of this parcel, on either
side of the Marshall-to-Carthage Road (Von
Rosenberg 1863). It is unknown if his holdings
out of the Lindsey Survey were occupied between
1851 and 1866.
Between mid 1866 and 1870, the 230 acres
out of the Lindsey Survey changed hands several
times, and a small chunk out of the southeast
corner was donated for a church. In June
1866, Copeland conveyed the land to James M.
Johnson and Thomas M. Hemby, but they
returned it only three months later. The same
day, Copeland conveyed the land to William S.
Coleman (Harrison County, Deed Records
U:204, 277, 278). Coleman conveyed a 4-acre
parcel out of the southeast corner of the 230acre parcel, where a church had been present
as early as 1863, to Liberty Church in October
1867 (Harrison County, Deed Record V:159;
Von Rosenberg 1863). A church remains extant
in this location. In January 1868, Coleman
conveyed the land, excepting the church grounds,
back to Copeland (Harrison County, Deed Record
V:234). In September 1869, Copeland conveyed
the land to L. E. Lister and James A. Thompson
(Harrison County, Deed Record V1:812). Finally,
in December 1870, Lister and Thompson
conveyed the property to Peter Shaw Sr. and
William Shaw, both former slaves (Harrison
County, Deed Record X:41). The relationship
between the Shaws remains unclear, and no
deed records a related transaction, but by about
1874, the two men had partitioned the land
and Shaw Sr. received the 100-acre parcel on
which 41HS965 is situated (Harrison County,
Ad Valorem Tax Record 1874).
Peter Shaw Sr. immigrated to Texas with
his young family. By 1870, they lived in Harrison
County with their six children, who ranged from
2 to 22 years old. None of the family could read
or write and, with the exception of an 8-year-old
son and 2-year-old daughter, the entire family
worked as farm hands. A female farm hand,
Rose Taylor, also resided with the family (U.S.
Department of the Interior, Census Office 1870).
They typically had a few work animals, such
as horses or mules, and milch cows and hogs
to provide dairy and meat (Harrison County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records 1880, 1884, 1885,
1890). In 1880, three Shaw families were living
together, likely on the 100-acre parcel that
Peter Shaw Sr. owned, since the others did not
22

own land at the time. Shaw Sr. had remarried
by 1880 and was living with his young wife
Rose, the Pierce and Palace Shaw family, the
Andrew (1853–1925) and Lucy Flowers Shaw
(1857–1922) family, with a combined total of
10 children. Shaw Sr.’s relationship with Pierce
Shaw is unclear, but Andrew was one of Shaw
Sr.’s several sons. Nearby were the families
of William and America Shaw and Frank and
Anna Shaw (Harrison County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records 1880, 1884, Rakoczy 2011a, 2011b;
1885; U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1880). The property had easy access to
the Marshall-to-Carthage Road to the east via
the east-west southern portion of a loop road.
A road connecting the loop road with Liberty
Church Road to the south traversed the center
of the property extending southwesterly (Van
Duyne and Byers 1913). Peter Shaw Sr. was
deceased by 1895 (Harrison County, Ad Valorem
Tax Record 1895).
Since Shaw Sr.’s estate was annually
appraised for taxes on the property for decades,
it is unclear whether the Shaw heirs or tenants
may have occupied the 100-acre parcel after
1895. Several members of the family resided
in the vicinity for many years but had other
landholdings of similar value (Harrison County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records 1900, 1905, 1910, 1915,
1920, 1925, 1930, 1935, 1940; U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1920,
1930; U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor,
Bureau of the Census 1910; U.S. Department
of the Interior, Census Office 1900). Family
members or their lessors had row crops on the
land in 1935 and woodland was present, but no
buildings remained extant (Tobin International
1935). By 1961, the property was pastureland
and woodland (Tobin International 1961).
Today, Shaw heirs still own the land. Peter
Shaw Jr. inherited the 100-acre parcel from
his father’s estate. His oldest son, James Shaw,
inherited the land upon his father’s 1959 death
(Harrison County, Deed Record 77:205). In the
1960s and 1970s, the Shaw heirs subdivided
their landholdings, including the 100 acres on
which 41HS965 is situated (Harrison County,
Deed Records).
In summary, 41HS965 is associated with
former slave Peter Shaw Sr. and his descendants.
Shaw Sr. operated a farmstead on this 100-acre
parcel beginning in 1870. After Shaw Sr.’s 1895
death, his heirs or their lessors used the land

for cropland, pastureland, and woodland through
the 1970s, but they did not occupy it by 1935.
Site 41HS966
Description
Site 41HS966, in the southeastern portion
of the survey area, is part of a historic farmstead
that fronted on the Marshall-to-Carthage Road
(U.S. Highway 59) just east of the project area.
The site is 150 m west of U.S. Highway 59, on
the south side of a 2.5-acre stock tank within
a cleared pasture. It sits on a broad, gently
sloping upland at an elevation of 330–340 ft.
Construction of the stock tank heavily impacted
the site. Much of the area is grown over with
bermudagrass, other grasses, and some dewberry
vines. Ground surface visibility varies, with most
areas having no surface visibility and one wash
having 100 percent visibility. A house is ca. 125
m northwest of the site, and the driveway to the
house cuts through the site.
Aerial photographs from 1935 show
several structures in this vicinity, connected by
a meandering two-track road to a house east
of the project area on the highway. The area
appears to have been in pasture, with several
large agricultural fields to the north. By the
time of the 1961 aerials, there were no buildings
at the location, though the house to the east
remained.
Nine shovel tests were excavated in the
immediate area, and three tests were positive
for cultural materials at depths of 0–40 cm
(Figure 6; see Table 3). Eight clear glass
fragments were recovered, along with four
unidentified fragments of iron, possibly very
corroded nails. Shovel test depth varied greatly
because the nearby stock tank construction
removed much of the sediment in places. Six
of the tests reached the Bt horizon between
28 and 60 cm, with the average depth to clay
being around 42 cm. The other three shovel
tests were very shallow, encountering heavily
mottled clay around 10–11 cm. Construction
of the stock tank and dam likely explain the
disturbed clay at the surface. In one area near
the tank in the east part of the site, historic
artifacts, including clear glass, whiteware,
possible porcelain, possible nails, and brown
bottle glass, were noted on the surface of a
bare erosional wash; these materials were not

Deed Record T:373). That September, Thompson
conveyed the land to Larry Thompson and
B. W. and Josephine G. Webb. They, in turn,
conveyed the property to William Fyffe that
December (Harrison County, Deed Record
V1:903). In January 1872, Fyffe conveyed the
151 acres to Howell Lewis (Harrison County,
Deed Record Y:17). Lewis was a physician
and lived in Marshall with his family in 1880
(U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office
1880).
By July 1888, Lewis was deceased, and his
estate conveyed the 151 acres to Mariah Daily
(Harrison County, Deed Record 23:36). John and
Mariah Daily probably occupied the land for a
few years, when the land was valued at $2 an
acre and they had a wagon, two equine, and two
bovine (Harrison County, Ad Valorem Tax Record
1890). It is unclear whether the property was
occupied between 1892 and 1895, when Daily
and her husband conveyed the 151 acres back
to the Lewis estate (Harrison County, Deed
Record 28:532).
In January 1895, the Lewis estate conveyed
75.5 acres, the east half of the property, to
former slave Philip Warren (Harrison County,
Deed Record 33:265). In May 1901, the estate
conveyed an adjacent 25-acre parcel to Warren
(Harris County, Deed Record 47:408). Warren,
born in 1860, resided on and farmed the land
until about 1922. In 1900, his cousin Nancy
Shaw, her husband, and their two children lived
with Warren (Harrison County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records 1895, 1900, 1905, 1910, 1915, 1920; U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census
1920; U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1900).
Subsequent property owners appear to
have lived elsewhere, but they or their lessors
continued to use the land for agriculture, and it
was occupied until at least 1961. In September
1922, Warren conveyed the land to Tom N. and
Lela Davis (Harrison County, Deed Record
125:53). The Davises lived in Marshall (Harrison
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records 1925). In
July 1925, the Davises conveyed the land to
William Lane, who also lived in town (Harrison
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records 1930, 1935,
1940; Harrison County, Deed Record 142:32).
By 1935, the farmstead still included a house
along the Marshall-to-Carthage Road east of
the project area and a road leading westward
to several outbuildings, including the location

of 41HS966 (Texas State Highway Department
1940; Tobin International 1935). William Lane’s
widow, Sallie Mae Lane, inherited the land upon
his 1949 death. At that time, the property was
considered to be 94.4 acres (Harrison County,
Probate Record 38:1). Former cropland was in
use as pastureland by 1958, and at least one
outbuilding was still present (U.S. Department of
the Interior, Geological Survey 1958). A portion
of the land was again cleared for row crops by
1961 (Texas State Highway Department 1961;
Tobin International 1961). Lane held the land
until 1964 (Harrison County, Deed Record
605:54).
In summary, 41HS966 was an outbuilding
possibly connected with two owner occupants.
John and Mariah Daily lived on the land and
operated a farm there between 1888 and 1895.
Former slave Philip Warren had the longest
association with the site, since he lived on the
land and operated a farm there from 1895 until
1922. Subsequent property owners appear to
have lived elsewhere, but they or their lessors
continued to use the land and associated
outbuildings for agriculture, and the house
was occupied until at least 1961. The land
remained in agricultural use for decades, but
the outbuildings, including 41HS966, were
demolished by 1961.
Site 41HS967
Description
Site 41HS967 is a historic artifact scatter
in the southeastern portion of the survey area,
ca. 165 m north of 41HS966. U.S. Highway 59
is ca. 130 m to the east, and the 2.5-acre stock
tank at 41HS966 is 30 m to the south. The site
sits on a broad upland with an elevation of
340 ft. It is in the same pasture as 41HS966.
Bermudagrass covers the entire site and the
surrounding pasture, affording virtually no
ground surface visibility.
None of the historical aerial photographs
show any type of structure at this location. In all
three images (1935, 1949, and 1961), it appears
to have been pastureland.
Six shovel tests were excavated in the
immediate vicinity of the site, and three were
positive, yielding two clear flat glass fragments,

fragments (probably nails), and one quartzite

for pastureland until the early 1960s. The house
is extant, but ruinous.
Site 41HS969
Description
Site 41HS969 is a sparse prehistoric lithic
scatter on the nose of an interfluve overlooking
the Eightmile Creek tributary that flows
through the central part of the project area. The
site is ca. 520 m west of U.S. Highway 59 and
1.7 km south of Interstate Highway 20. It sits at
an elevation of 320–330 ft, with the creek to the
east near 310 ft. The site sits on a landform that
looks to have been untouched for many years,
and there are no obvious major disturbances.
Large red oaks and pines tower above the site,
and vegetation at ground level is thin. Overall,
ground surface visibility was low due to grasses
and leaf litter covering much of the surface.
Thirteen shovel tests were excavated on
and around the site, with several other negative
tests upslope to the southwest (Figure 9; see
Table 3). Five tests were positive for cultural
materials, yielding seven flakes and a possible
fragment of shatter. Seven of the tests reached
100 cm or deeper without encountering the Bt
horizon, while the remaining six reached the Bt
horizon between 60 and 84 cm below surface,
averaging 74 cm. Four of the eight artifacts
were found at 0–20 cm, two were at 20–40 cm,
one was at 40–60 cm, and one was at 60–80 cm.
Using the extent of the landform and extent of
positive tests, the site covers an area of about
80x50 m.

Site History
Site 41HS968 (Resource 7) is on Tract
1391-25.1, which encompasses 5.36 acres out
of the northeast quadrant of the 2,697.63-acre
Pennington Lindsey Survey. This site is near
the southwest corner of the tract, west of the
Marshall-to-Carthage Road. For the history of
the land on which 41HS968 is situated from
1838 until 1853, see 41HS965; for the history of
this land from 1853 until 1899, see 41HS966.
In October 1899, the Howell Lewis estate
conveyed 25 acres out of the Lindsey Survey to
former slave Henry Taylor and his wife Eliza
Ann Taylor (Harrison County, Deed Record
36:375). This family’s twentieth-century history
is difficult to trace, with so many in the vicinity
sharing their surname. Two years later, Taylor
paid the estate $48 for the land, which was
considered his homestead (Harrison County,
Deed Record 49:238). He had been born a slave
in Tennessee in 1835; his wife had been born in
Texas in 1868. They married in 1885 and had
10 children living with them by 1900. Although
their parents were illiterate, the 3 oldest children
attended some school, but they also worked as
farm laborers (U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1900). The property stayed in the
family for many years, was occupied in 1935,
and may have been occupied in 1961 (Tobin
International 1935, 1961).
By January 1973, Tom Taylor and Luther B.
Taylor owned 50 acres out of the Lindsey Survey,
which they conveyed to Juanita Collier Tolbert
and Annie Michelle Tolbert (Harrison County,
Deed Records 725:420; 739:631). A decade later,
the family heirs partitioned the 50-acre parcel,
and Laura Gardner received the 5.36-acre parcel
on which 41HS968 is situated (Harrison County,
Deed Record 1049:242).
In summary, 41HS968 is associated with
former slave Henry Taylor and his wife Eliza
Ann Taylor beginning in 1899. The property has
remained in the Taylor family for decades, and

Site 41HS970
Description
Site 41HS970 is a very sparse lithic scatter
on the western boundary of the survey area. The
site occupies a small, gently rising ridge near
the head of one branch of the Eightmile Creek
tributary that flows through the central part of
the project area; this small stream is ca. 20 m to
the east of the site. Elevation of the site is around
340 ft, with the stream bed around 335 ft. Only
a small sliver of the landform that the site likely
occupies is within the project area, and it is
possible that more of the site extends to the west

on the landform. Since this is outside the survey
area, the location could not be tested. Much of
the area around the site and along the stream
is pine and mixed hardwood regrowth, with
dense underbrush, greenbriers, poison ivy, and
yaupons. Ground surface visibility is very low
due to dense leaf and pine needle litter. There
are no obvious major disturbances, although the
area surely has been impacted by past logging.
Five shovel tests were excavated on the
landform that the site occupies (Figure 10; see
Table 3). Only two were positive, yielding a
single flake and a bipolar core from the upper
20 cm. The Bt horizon was reached in each of
the five tests between 50 and 88 cm, averaging
75 cm. The limited number of shovel tests is
a result of the landform existing primarily
outside the survey area. An estimate of overall
site size cannot be made, since more of it likely
lies west of the project area, but the part within

the survey area is no larger than 20x15 m. It is
bounded on the east and north by the branch of
the tributary and an associated draw and on the
south by a negative test.
Site 41HS971
Description
Site 41HS971 is a historic farmstead on
gently sloping upland terrain within an area
of terraced plowed fields just north of the
center of the survey area. The main part of the
site consists of an occupied historic-age house
(also recorded as Resource 2A) with several
outbuildings and structures of various ages,
though apparently all more recent than the
house. This complex covers an area roughly
90 m east-west by 80 m north-south in the
north part of the site, while the entire site

measures 90 m east-west by 170 m north-south.
Lacking right of entry to the immediate area of
the house, the survey crew could not record it
and the surrounding buildings and structures
in any detail. This part of the site is mostly open
with some trees, and ground surface visibility
is less than 10 percent. A modern house is just
to the north. Two single-wide manufactured
homes are immediately west of the house, both
of which have fallen into a state of disrepair.
It is unclear if anyone resides in either trailer
home, but they appear to have been lived in
recently due to the surface debris near them.
Modern occupation has disturbed parts of this
area substantially. The southern half of the
site consists of an artifact scatter apparently
associated with the farmstead. Part of this
area is wooded, part is cleared with the grass
having been mowed down to near the ground
surface, and part is overgrown with dense
bermudagrass, dewberry vines, and a large
antique rose. Several fruit trees are growing
here, and there are remnants of a small pen or
fenced yard. A small stack of old lumber and
sheet metal may represent a ruinous building
associated with the farmstead. Ground surface

visibility varied, with some areas having
no visibility and others having near 50 to
75 percent.
The 1935 aerial photograph of the area
shows a house and one or two outbuildings
in the north part of the site, surrounded by a
terraced field; the southwest part of the site
was pastureland. This complex also appears on
the 1949 and 1961 aerials and the 1958 USGS
topographic map.
The immediate house area was not shovel
tested because of a lack of access, but single
tests were excavated on its north and east edges,
and 11 tests were placed south of it (Figure 11;
see Table 3). The test northwest of the house
(AN046) yielded a modern beer bottle fragment
at 0–20 cm and a plastic cup fragment at 20–
40 cm (not collected), demonstrating the level
of disturbance in this area. This test was placed
near a brick pavement that may have served as a
sitting area under a shade tree. Four of the tests
south of the house were positive, yielding two
fragments of clear glass, one screw, two probable
cut nail fragments, one whiteware sherd, and a
single unidentifiable metal object. All but 1 test
reached the Bt horizon between 26 and 72 cm,
30

with the average depth of clay being 51 cm. None
of the artifacts found are diagnostic, but they
are consistent with use during the twentieth
century. The only materials observed on the
surface were modern trash scattered across
portions of the north part of the site.
Based on the aerial photographs and the
site history recounted below, it appears that this
farmstead was occupied continuously through
much of the twentieth century and possibly
longer. With this lengthy history, the potential
for significant archeological deposits is low.

tenants may have occupied the land while the
Whaleys owned it.
In December 1919, Margaret Eugenia
Coleman Whaley conveyed her land out of the
Lindsey Survey to the Whaley Farm Corporation
(Harrison County, Deed Record 106:195). By
1935, a house and outbuildings were present,
and the nearby agricultural fields were terraced
(Tobin International 1935). The farmstead had
easy access to the Marshall-to-Carthage Road
to the east via the east-west northern portion
of a loop road. From it, another road extended
northwesterly (Van Duyne and Byers 1913). It
is likely that tenants had occupied the property
for some time.
In February 1937, the Whaley heirs
conveyed 100 acres out of the Lindsey Survey
to William C. Deason Sr. (Harrison County,
Deed Record 221:402). In 1940, he lived on
the farmstead with his wife Myrtle, two sons,
and a daughter and son-in-law. The farm was
valued at $1,500. He was a coach builder,
and his son-in-law likely operated the farm
(U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the
Census 1940).
The Deason heirs partitioned their holdings
out of the Lindsey Survey in 1979. As a result,
Tract 1391-29.2 contains 12 acres, Tract 139129.32 contains 4 acres, and Tract 1391-29.33
contains 11 acres (Harrison County, Deed Record
870:724).
In summary, 41HS971 is on land associated
with Thomas Jefferson and Margaret Eugenia
Coleman Whaley, their heirs, and possible
tenants from 1857 to 1937. William C. Sr.
and Myrtle Deason lived on and operated the
farmstead associated with 41HS971 beginning
in 1937. A house (Resource 2A) and agricultural
field (Resource 2B) remain extant.

Site History
Site 41HS971 (also recorded as Resource
2) is on three tracts (1391-29.2, 1391-29.32, and
1391-29.33) that encompass a total of 27 acres
out of the northeast quadrant of the 2,697.63acre Pennington Lindsey Survey. This site is
south of Shady Drive and west of the Marshallto-Carthage Road. For the history of the land
on which 41HS971 is situated from 1838 until
1850, see 41HS965.
In February 1850, Lindsey conveyed a
151-acre parcel out of the northeast quadrant
of his survey to Stephen B. Price (Harrison
County, Deed Record K:26). That same day, Price
conveyed the land to John P. Gilmore (Harrison
County, Deed Record J:329). In January 1851,
Gilmore conveyed the land to James Williamson
Parchman (Harrison County, Deed Record
J:332). In March 1855, Parchman conveyed
the land to Benjamin D. Parchman (Harrison
County, Deed Record O:209).
In 1857, Benjamin D. and Virginia Parchman
conveyed the land to Thomas Jefferson Whaley
(Harrison County, Deed Record P:328). The
Thomas Jefferson and Margaret Eugenia
Coleman Whaley homestead was nearby until
at least 1880. By 1900, the Whaleys resided in
Marshall (Harrison County Historical Museum
n.d.; U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor,
Bureau of the Census 1910; U.S. Department
of the Interior, Census Office 1880, 1900; Von
Rosenberg 1863). In 1910, the Whaleys held
571 acres out of the Lindsey Survey, an adjacent
50 acres out of the Ramsdale Survey, and three
lots in Marshall, including their residence
(Harrison County, Ad Valorem Tax Records
1910). In 1911, Whaley died and his widow
inherited the land. It is unknown whether

Site 41HS972
Description
Site 41HS972 is a historic farmstead
represented by a brick cistern and associated
artifact scatter on a broad, gently sloping upland
in the northwestern corner of the survey area.
Elevations range between 400 and 410 ft. The
nearest streams once ran 100 to 120 m to the
east, but the topography and drainage patterns
in this part of the project area have been altered
by the excavation of a large clay borrow pit

measuring ca. 200x200 m, or roughly 10 acres,
ca. 6–9 m deep just northeast of the site. Ground
surface visibility is very low, with bermudagrass
covering much of the area. Thick dewberry
vines and a variety of thick grasses, weeds, and
young hardwood saplings are growing in the
north part of the site. Excavation of the clay
pit likely impacted the northern and eastern
portions of the site, and remnants of push piles
and burned stumps attest to disturbance from
tree clearing. Just south of the site, much of the
soil has washed away, exposing dark red clay at
the surface.
None of the aerial photographs or historic
maps show any building or farm complex at this
location, indicating that it predates 1935. Images
from 1935 through 1961 show the area to be open
pasture or rangeland with few trees.
The only feature evident on the surface is
a subterranean cistern; it is possible that the
mouth and neck once extended aboveground
but have been removed by land clearing and
scraping. It is constructed of red handmade
brick, likely from very local sources. It is
about 0.6 m in diameter at the mouth, with an
estimated internal diameter of 1.5–2.0 m and an
estimated depth of about 2.5 m. It would have
held between 1100 and 1700 gallons of water; it
was not holding water at the time of the survey.
It closely resembles the beveled-shoulder style of
cistern described by Denton (2011). This cistern
would have been very near a building, most
likely a house, but no evidence of one, such as
footing stones or a chimney base, was found. The
household and personal artifacts recovered in
shovel testing (described below) clearly indicate
domestic use, however.
Fifteen shovel tests were excavated around
the cistern (Figure 12; see Table 3). Ten of these
were positive, containing 9 glass fragments,
7 brick fragments, 4 whiteware sherds, 2
stoneware sherds, 1 semiporcelain sherd, 10
cut nails, 1 wire nail, 1 bolt, 1 nondiagnostic
ceramic pipe bowl fragment, 1 hot comb (a
comb with an elongated handle and teeth
meant to be heated by a fire or on a stovetop),
and 1 flake. The flake is considered to be an
incidental inclusion and not an indicator of a
prehistoric component. All the artifacts were in
the upper 20 cm. The wire nail is very modern
in appearance and may have been introduced
through recent activities associated with the
nearby clay borrow pit. Other than the flake

and perhaps the wire nail, the assemblage
appears to relate to occupation before 1935.
Shovel test depth ranged from 16 to 70 cm, with
an average depth of 38 cm to the Bt horizon.
The upper sediments in many of the tests were
very loose and dry, with a dark color, probably
reflecting burning of push piles of trees and
debris. Several fragments of whiteware were
observed on the surface in a wash downslope
from the site, and a single large whiteware
fragment was collected from near the mouth
of the cistern. Based on the locations of the
cistern and the positive shovel tests, the site
encompasses an area of ca. 80x40 m.
Site History
Site 41HS972 straddles Tract 1538-002,
which encompasses 25 acres, and Tract 1538003.1, which encompasses 14.59 acres, out of
the northwest quadrant of the 320-acre Jackson
Page Survey. This site is south of the frontage
road that parallels the south side of Interstate
Highway 20 and west of the Marshall-toCarthage Road.
Andrew Jackson Page, a native of North
Carolina, came to Texas as early as 1834, when
he was about 33 years old. The Shelby County
board of land commissioners issued a first-class
land grant to Page for one-third league of land in
August 1838 (Texas General Land Office 1857).
Page owned other land certificates that would
be patented as a 645.13-acre survey in Harrison
County and a 511-acre survey that straddles
Panola and Shelby Counties. In April 1840, Page
sold his certificate to Joshua T. Gill. A lawsuit
that neighbor Francis Ramsdale initiated in
1848 questioning the survey’s boundaries was
finally resolved in May 1850. That November, the
district surveyor located 320 acres in Harrison
County. Gill was deceased when the State of
Texas issued a patent for this survey to his heirs
on February 9, 1857 (Texas General Land Office
1860a, 1860b, 1885). It is unclear whether the
Page or Gill families occupied the land before
1857.
In May 1857, Gill’s daughter and sole heir,
Eliza Gill Heffner, conveyed the Page Survey
to Josiah Marshall (Harrison County, Deed
Record P:564). Marshall was a wealthy lawyer,
politician, editor, and slaveholding plantation
owner who lived in town (Harrison County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records 1857, 1859, 1861, 1862,

1863, 1864; Legislative Reference Library of
Texas 2012). By 1859, he had a sawmill and
gristmill that were on the east side of the
Marshall-to-Carthage Road (Johnson 1996; Von
Rosenberg 1863). He had the Confederate mills
tanyard, shoe shop, and distillery built on the
Page Survey by 1864 (Harrison County, Deed
Record T:656). The specific locations of these
improvements are unknown.
In January 1864, Marshall conveyed the
Page Survey, including the tanyard, shoe shop,
and distillery to S. D. Rainey and A. R. Wiggs
(Harrison County, Deed Record T:656). By July
1865, Wiggs was the sole owner of the land, when
he conveyed the survey, along with the 1,055-acre
Marshall Plantation to the southeast on the east
side of the Marshall-to-Carthage Road, to E. R.
Davis. This conveyance included the sawmill,
gristmill, and distillery (Harrison County, Deed
Record T:790). In September 1866, Davis and

his wife conveyed both properties back to Wiggs,
including the mills and distillery, along with a
steam engine, bailers, flour mill, cotton gin and
press, and blacksmith tools (Harrison County,
Deed Record V1:464). The specific locations of
these improvements are unknown.
Although no deed records any related
transactions, by January 1871, Samuel Burnett
owned 80 acres out of the northwest quadrant
of the Page Survey, when he conveyed the
land to Jonas Hale for $212.50 (Harrison
County, Deed Record X:33). Between 1872 and
1879, the value of the property varied, but
Hale consistently had a few head of equine,
bovine, and swine, along with some cash or
miscellaneous holdings. In 1879, he also had
four goats (Harrison County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records 1872, 1878, 1879).
Although no deed records any related
transactions, former slaves George Robert Sr.
34

and Flora Ann Brown Hale owned the 80-acre
parcel by 1880. That year the family lived with
widower Joe Hale, a farmer, and widow Mary
Hale, George Robert Sr.’s mother. The Hales had
two children, Jonas and Susan, who each worked
as laborers. Nearby was Flora Ann Brown Hale’s
widowed mother, Lucy Brown, who worked as a
farmer and had a laborer daughter and infant
granddaughter living with her. All of these
adults were illiterate (Harrison County, Deed
Record 218:298; U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1880). The family generally had
a wagon and a few head of equine, bovine, and
swine (Harrison County, Ad Valorem Tax Records
1884, 1890, 1895, 1900, 1905, 1910). By 1900, the
Hales were farming and had their two youngest
children, Hannah and George Robert Jr., both
of whom attended school, and her mother living
with them (U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1900). In 1910, the Hales had her
mother and three teenage grandchildren, each of
whom attended school, residing with them (U.S.
Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of
the Census 1910). A widow by 1915, Flora Ann
Hale continued to live on the farm and had
a boarder renting and farming the property
(Harrison County, Ad Valorem Tax Record 1915;
U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the
Census 1920). The value of the 80-acre parcel
had increased to $8 an acre by 1925. She was
deceased by 1930 (Harrison County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records 1925, 1930). It is unlikely the land
was occupied by 1935, when no remnants of
buildings or structures were present (Tobin
International 1935).
By 1927, the Hale sisters owned the land
(Harrison County, Deed Record 153:642). In
1930, they partitioned the property through
a lawsuit. Hannah Hale Lambert received a
30-acre parcel, and Susan Hale Austin (also
referred to as Alston) received a 25-acre parcel
(Harrison County, Deed Records Z:24, 218:298).
At the time, Austin and her husband lived on the
Marshall-to-Carthage Road (U.S. Department of
Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1930). Flora
Ann Hale’s estate paid taxes on the property for
many years, claiming the land as a homestead
(Harrison County, Ad Valorem Tax Records 1930,
1935, 1940). In April 1933, Austin conveyed the
25-acre parcel to Milton Williams (Harrison
County, Deed Record 193:272). The following
year, Williams conveyed the land to Emmett I.
Anderson (Harrison County, Deed Record

199:59). The property belonged to the Andersons
or their heirs until 2002 (Harrison County, Deed
Records 881:525, 2505:13, 2505:20). Lambert
held her portion of the property longer and, in
1964, conveyed the 30-acre parcel to Bobby E.
Jones and Roy C. Heath (Harrison County, Deed
Records 582:629, 585:249). By 1979, Jones and
Heath partitioned the land into two 14.59acre parcels, with Jones retaining the eastern
parcel (Harrison County, Deed Records 875:734,
1593:267). Jones conveyed this parcel to Robert
and Penny Paulk in 1996 (Harrison County,
Deed Record 1593:267).
In summary, 41HS972 was briefly associated
with Samuel Burnett (by 1871) and Jonas Hale
(1871–1879) but had its longest association with
George Robert Sr. and Flora Ann Hale and their
descendants. The Hales operated a farmstead on
an 80-acre parcel beginning in 1880. After Hale’s
death some time between 1910 and 1915, his
heirs occupied the property until at least 1925.
By 1935, the land was no longer occupied.
Assessments of Archeological
Sites
The survey reported here recorded eight
archeological sites (41HS965–41HS972). Sites
41HS969 and 41HS970 are prehistoric sites.
The other six are historic (single prehistoric
artifacts found at two of these are interpreted
as incidental inclusions rather than indicators
of prehistoric components).
Both prehistoric sites (41HS969 and
41HS970) lack the capacity to yield important
information and are considered ineligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic
Places under Criterion D. Both contain scatters
of lithic artifacts that are so sparse that it
is doubtful that interpretable quantities of
cultural materials are present. Site 41HS969
is represented by just seven artifacts from 5
shovel tests, with 11 other tests on the same
landform being negative, and 41HS970 is
represented by two lithics from 2 positive
tests out of 5 excavated. Both are in upland
settings and are mostly or entirely in the upper
20 cm of sandy sediments. Neither site has the
potential to contain well-stratified deposits or
preserved matrix-defined cultural features.
Given the nature of the remains, their context,
the absence of temporally diagnostic artifacts,
and the apparent lack of charcoal or other
35

Results of the historical
resources Survey

datable materials, isolating components at
these sites and dating them confidently would
be impossible. With this limitation, they are
judged not to contain important information
about Native American use of the area.
All six historic sites also are considered
ineligible for National Register of Historic Places
listing under Criterion D. Two are scatters
of twentieth-century artifacts that probably
represent a farm outbuilding (41HS966) and
a trash deposit (41HS967) associated with
houses that fronted on U.S. Highway 59 to the
east outside the project area. Their recent ages
and poor context indicate they do not contain
important archeological information about
the history of the area. The other four historic
sites are farmsteads or house sites. Two of
these (41HS968 and 41HS971) appear to date
primarily if not entirely to the twentieth century,
with 41HS968 perhaps being occupied into the
1960s and 41HS971 still be being occupied today.
Their recent ages, the sparseness of archeological
remains at 41HS968, and the abundance of
essentially modern remains at 41HS971 indicate
that they are poor candidates for contributing
important archeological information.
The other two farmsteads or house sites
(41HS965 and 41HS972) appear to date to the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
based on the presence of cut nails, the aerial
photograph evidence, and the archival record.
Site 41HS965 is interpreted as a farmstead or
house site based on the archival evidence and
the nature of the sparse artifact assemblage.
No features confirming this, such as foundation
stones, a chimney base, or depressions marking
a well or privy, are evident on the surface,
however. Features may be lacking because the
site was in a plowed field by 1935. In addition to
suffering from probably many years of plowing,
the site has been disturbed more recently by
construction of a well road and pipelines. Site
41HS972 retains at least one domestic feature
(a cistern) and has a more-substantial artifact
deposit. However, it is adjacent to a large borrow
pit, and much of the area has been disturbed
through bulldozing and clearing, with all surface
sediments in some areas having been removed.
Because their integrity has been compromised,
41HS965 and 41HS972 lack the capacity to
contribute important information and are
considered ineligible for National Register
listing.

Summary of the Resources
The file search and literature review
indicated that that no formally designated
properties exist in the study area and that
several historic contexts apply to it. No resources
in the study area have National Historic
Landmark, National Register, or Recorded
Texas Historic Landmark designation. Prior to
this survey, no resources in the study area had
been identified or documented, and none have
undergone Historic American Buildings Survey
or Historic American Engineering Record
recordation. Appropriate historic contexts
gleaned from the literature review for this
study area are agriculture, architecture, ethnic
heritage (African American), and industry.
Reconnaissance survey of buildings and
structures identified and, to the extent possible,
documented 13 historic-age resources in the
study area (Table 4; Figure 13). The appendix
to this report contains historical resources
survey forms with photographs of the resources.
These resources represent three property types:
domestic buildings (n = 4) and associated
outbuildings (n = 4), industrial properties
(n = 4), and agricultural resources (n = 1).
Domestic buildings and associated
outbuildings are the most common property
type in the study area. Four houses are each
very modest wood-frame buildings. The oldest
extant house (Resource 7/41HS968) was built
in about 1900 and was associated with the
Henry and Eliza Ann Taylor family. Because
it is ruinous, stylistic influences and forms are
largely imperceptible, and the integrity of the
building has been irreversibly compromised.
Two other pre-war house forms in the study
area are a ca. 1920 L-plan house (Resource
2A/41HS971) and a ca. 1940 side-gable house
(Resource 3). One house (Resource 1A) exhibits
details common to Minimal Traditional design,
popular in the 1950s. Minimal Traditional
design offers only the barest ornamentation that
mimics classical or colonial revival detailing.
Resources 1A, 2A, and 3 are in their original
locations; however, none retains integrity of
design, materials, or workmanship because of
alterations that replaced original fabric with
modern components, such as windows, doors,

study area are small wood-frame buildings that
have no particular style and are classified by roof
types, which are either side-gable (Resource 1E)
or shed (Resources 1B–D) roofs.
Four industrial properties intersect the
study area. Two electric transmission lines
(Resources 4 and 5) conveyed power in the
vicinity by about 1930. An underground natural
gas gathering pipeline (Resource 8) carried
extracted minerals by this time also. A ca. 1960
tank battery (Resource 6) provides storage for
extracted materials. These resources are in their
original locations but have undergone routine
maintenance that required the replacement of
numerous original components with nonhistoric
parts.
The single agricultural property extant in
the study area is an agricultural field (Resource
2B). Likely present before 1935, by about that
time it had been terraced to help prevent erosion.
The setting has been compromised with plow
contours barely visible and changing land use
over time.

historic-age resources were evaluated within
the historic contexts of agriculture, architecture,
ethnic heritage, and industry. Registration
requirements applied to the study area guided
examination of each resource’s integrity, which
informed recommendations regarding eligibility.
For resources to be considered eligible, they
should retain historical and architectural
authenticity, best articulated by the seven
aspects of integrity: location, setting, design,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association
(Andrus and Shrimpton 2002; U.S. Department
of the Interior, National Park Service 1997).
However, differing levels of these aspects of
integrity will apply in the study area, depending
on the criterion under consideration.
Resources in the study area that could be
considered eligible under Criterion A or B are
those associated with events or broad patterns in
history or persons affiliated with those activities.
Although it is necessary to consider architectural
and physical integrity for resources evaluated
under Criterion A or B, attributes of historical
integrity will be more highly valued for these
criteria. Thus, the most important aspects of
integrity for evaluating resources under these
criteria are location, feeling, and association.
Resources evaluated under these criteria must
also be assessed with respect to their integrity
of setting, design, materials, and workmanship,
but will not be held to as high a standard for
these physical attributes. Although stronger
candidates will likely offer good representation
of each of the seven aspects of integrity, at a
minimum, resources eligible under Criterion A
or B must be in their original location and retain
much of their historic fabric, including building
footprint, fenestration pattern, and characterdefining details. These resources may have
undergone one or more nonhistoric changes that
would be acceptable if intrinsic physical features
remain intact. Those that have accumulated
more than one change to essential physical
features, causing a higher percentage of loss to
original historic fabric and architectural design,
are less likely to be eligible. Also less likely to
be eligible are resources that have experienced
major changes such as altered fenestration
patterns, unsympathetic additions, or loss of
important historic components. Those that
are in poor physical condition or were moved
from their original location and setting are not
likely to be eligible. Historic-period changes

Assessments of Historic-Age
Resources
After synthesizing the research and field
investigations, each historic-age resource in
the study area was evaluated to assess its
National Register eligibility. Eligible historic
properties are buildings, structures, objects,
sites, or districts that meet the National Register
criteria for evaluation at the national, state, or
local level of significance. The criteria call for
properties considered eligible to be significant
for historical associations with events or broad
patterns in history (Criterion A), persons
(Criterion B), architecture (Criterion C), or
prehistoric or historic archeology (Criterion D)
(Andrus and Shrimpton 2002; U.S. Department
of the Interior, National Park Service 1997).
In general, properties that are eligible should
be 50 years of age or older. To the extent
possible, given the limited secondary research
allocated for reconnaissance-level contextual
documentation, resources in the study area
were evaluated under Criterion A or B when
associative qualities were obvious. Each
historic-age resource was also evaluated under
Criterion C. Criterion D is considered for the
archeological sites recorded. For each criterion,
39

are acceptable. Resources evaluated as eligible
under Criterion A or B should retain notable
integrity of feeling, best accomplished with an
intact setting that conveys information about
the germane period of significance. Integrity
of association must be present with evidence,
preferably archival research, that relates specific
information about how the resource, or its owner
or occupant, was affiliated with specific events
or patterns related to the historic contexts
applicable to this study area. The compromised
integrity of the identified resources in the study
subjugates their associative qualities with
important historical trends, events, or people.
As a result, the resources in this study area are
recommended as not eligible for the National
Register under Criteria A and B.
Resources in the study area that could be
considered eligible under Criterion C are those
that embody the distinctive characteristics of
a style, type, period, or method of construction,
and may be representative or rare examples of
such. Although it is necessary to consider the
historical significance and integrity of resources
evaluated under Criterion C, attributes of
architectural significance and physical integrity
will be more highly valued for this criterion.
Thus, the most important aspects of integrity
for evaluating resources under this criterion
are location, setting, design, materials, and
workmanship. Resources evaluated under this
criterion must also be assessed with respect to
their integrity of feeling and association, but will
not be held to as high a standard for these lesstangible attributes. Architectural significance
and integrity are evaluated by comparing these
resources to others of like stylistic influence, type,
period, or method of construction in and near the
study area. Resources eligible under Criterion
C should remain in their original location and
retain their historic-period setting. They should
have experienced no or few intrusive alterations
that permanently modify their design, materials,
or workmanship. Consequently, they should
be exemplary of their style, type, period, or
method of construction and retain characterdefining features associated with these physical
aspects of integrity. Historic-period changes
are acceptable. Integrity of feeling is best
accomplished with an intact setting that conveys
information about the germane period of
significance. Integrity of association must be
present with an explanation that relates how

a resource exudes representation or rarity of
style, type, period, or method of construction.
None of the resources documented in the study
area are exemplary of a style, type, period, or
method of construction. These resources are
commonplace, possess no special attributes,
and do not impart architectural or engineering
qualities that are clearly distinguishable. As
a result, the resources in this study area are
recommended as not eligible for the National
Register under Criterion C.
Based on research and an examination of
the distribution of historic-age resources, no
potential historic districts associated with local
agricultural, architectural, ethnic heritage, or
industrial history are in or near the study area.
The overriding premise for this recommendation
is a lack of a unified or interconnected collection
of resources that could be considered contributing
elements to a potential historic district. Historic
maps and aerial photographs guided initial
identification of potential historic districts
(Texas State Highway Department 1940, 1961;
Tobin International 1935, 1961; U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1949, U.S. Department
of the Interior, Geological Survey 1958; Von
Rosenberg 1863). By the late twentieth century,
local agricultural and land use practices had
changed considerably from cash-crop production
to livestock raising, to the extent that it was
unlikely to expect historic-age agricultural
resources and landscape features to be extant,
much less to retain their historic-period functions
or integrity. Archival evidence indicates the
possible presence of slaves in the antebellum
era and that of freedmen in the postbellum era.
However, no collection of buildings or structures
associated with an African American ethnic
heritage context is extant in the study area.
Archival evidence also indicates the potential
for historic districts associated with industrial
activity, such as local mineral extraction or
electricity transmission, but no groupings of
resources are present. Collectively, the historicage resources in this study area offer neither
exemplary nor typical groupings that replicate
historic agricultural practices, architectural
influences, ethnic heritage, or industrial
development. Extant historic-age resources and
landscape features, both in and near the study
area, do not provide enough historic fabric to
adequately portray integrity of setting, feeling,
40

or association that would be necessary for a
historic district associated with any of these
contexts.
In conclusion, the reconnaissance survey
of buildings and structures identified and
documented 13 historic-age resources in
the study area. All of these resources are
recommended as not eligible for listing in the
National Register, and no potential historic
districts were identified in the study area. As
a result, no further work is recommended for
historical resources.

Sabine Mine’s Q2 Area in Harrison County,
Texas. The archeological survey resulted in
the discovery of 8 previously unrecorded sites,
2 of which are prehistoric Native American
sites and 6 of which are historic sites. Both
Native American sites are small lithic scatters.
The historic sites are small artifact scatters
or farmsteads and house sites. None of the
archeological sites is considered eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places
under Criterion D. The historical resources
survey identified 13 historic-age resources;
4 are domestic buildings, 4 are associated
outbuildings, 4 are industrial properties, and 1
is an agricultural resource. None of the historicage resources is considered eligible for listing
in the National Register under Criterion A–C.
No further archeological or historical work is
recommended for the project area.

Summary of conclusions
and recommendations
In 2012, personnel with Prewitt and
Associates, Inc., performed archeological and
