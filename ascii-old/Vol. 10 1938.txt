Forword
History
The Texas Archeological and Paleontological
Society was founded in October, 1928, in the office
of Dr. Cyrus N. Ray, in the City of Abilene, Texas,
by a small group of about a dozen persons. The
President and Vice-President and two Directors,
Drs. W. C. Holden and Rupert N. Richardson have
been consecutively re-elected each year since the
original session. The present Secretary-Treasurer,
Dr. Otto O. Watts, also took part in the organization
meeting. At that time certain undertakings were
visualized as desirable objectives for the Society
and were expressed in the foreword of Volume One
of the Bulletin as follows:
Objects of the Society
The society was organized and chartered in
pursuit of a literary and scientific undertaking; for
the study of the history and prehistory and the major
and minor artifacts of man and the fossils
representing the past floras and faunas of Texas;
for the encouragement of the proper collection and
preservation of such artifacts and fossils in museums
and their study and classification and the publication
of the results of the researches incident thereto.
Realization of the Objectives
At the time the above was written (1928) there
were no museums in Texas worthy of the name.
Very little scientific archeological research was
then being done in Texas, and most of that little
was by out of the State museums. Hardly any
publication had been done cither by Texas
educational institutions or by societies. Having no
educational institution back of us, no financial
backer to pay the bills, and no museum within
hundreds of miles, we were about as badly
handicapped in starting a scientific publication
society as can be imagined. We were surrounded
by an area hundreds of miles across in which almost
no anthropological research had been done.

This is the tenth annual volume of the Bulletin
which has each year steadily grown in size and in
service to those desiring scientific publication in a
medium able to adequately illustrate the subjects
discussed.
Museums of Texas
Due in part to the Society’s work in the promotion
of the idea of Texas Museums, such institutions have
been built in various sections of Texas within the
past few years. While most of these are yet small,
several projects of some size have been started in
the larger cities of Texas.
Within the past year the West Texas Chamber of
Commerce has opened an all West Texas Museum
in Abilene in which The Texas Archeological and
Paleontological Society is represented by five large
museum cases, in which are shown collections of
members of the Society.
Interest in Society’s Bulletins International
The importance of the scientific discoveries
made in Texas prehistory during the past ten years,
and recorded in the Bulletins of this Society, have
been such as to arouse much scientific interest in
the Society’s publications not only in all parts of
America, but throughout the world as well.
The Society’s Bulletins constitute the larger part
of the foundation or source literature on Texas
archeology, and as such are in demand by the leading
scientific libraries of America, and of foreign
countries. The publication funds of the Society are
obtained by the dues of members, the sales of books,
and donations of interested members, and friends
of The Society.

Neither the officers nor the editor have ever
received any monetary compensation whatever for
the great amount of labor involved in the Society’s
activities. The work has been freely and cheerfully

A DESCRIPTION OF TEXAS PICTOGRAPHS
BY FORREST KIRKLAND
In my first article which appeared in the 1937
Bulletin, of the Society our methods of work were
described and what we had accomplished during
the past three years was briefly reviewed. Having
then laid the foundation for a series of articles, we
are now ready to give details concerning some of
the many interesting questions relative to Indian
pictographs.
Many of the more important questions which
we hope to answer, or, at least to throw some light
on by our investigation, must necessarily await
discussion until sites in all parts of the state have
been studied. This is especially true of such
questions as the age and exact relationship of the
cultures. Since our survey has not reached the
Panhandle area nor the region around El Paso where
important sites are known, it will be better, at this
time, to turn our attention to questions of a more
general nature, which can be discussed with some
assurance in the light of the material gathered from
the thirty-seven sites, which we have already
studied. So, I have chosen for consideration in this
paper, two of the most common questions asked
about pictographs—questions which I believe can
be answered with some degree of certainty. They
are: “Can pictographs be interpreted?” and “How
do pictographs rate as works of art?”

which is, in fact, a very unimpressive example of
Indian carvings when compared to the many fine
petroglyphs in Texas and other parts of the country.
And as a result of all this literature, only two facts
seem clear: that the petroglyphs were made by the
Indians, and that the interpretations offered are
either wholly absurd or unsubstantiated opinions
of their authors. Articles in recent bulletins of well
known organizations, have devoted considerable
space to the interpretation of Indian pictographs.
These articles make interesting reading; but even
when the interpretations seem plausible, they are
always unconvincing from a scientific point of view.
Methods of Interpretation

So far as I can determine, there are only two
approaches to the meaning of pictographs or any
other unknown system of writing: through an
explanation by one who already knows the meaning,
and through the discovery of some key, or “Rosetta
stone,” which would unlock the hidden meaning.
The logical procedure in the first case would be to
have living Indians interpret the pictographs. This
has been attempted innumerable times in all parts
of the country; but with no success. As early as
1880, when Garrick Mallery2 was making his
investigation of Indian pictures, the old Indians,
even at that early date, disclaimed any knowledge
of their meaning. They claimed to have no idea who

imagination of even the most unlearned observer.

This almost universal interest seems to revolve associated with the Indians, have often been
about the idea of being able, some day, to solve consulted about the meaning of Indian pictures, and
their meaning. The first question usually asked is: have sometimes offered elaborate interpretations.
“Do you know how to read the Indian pictures?” A In view of the fact, however, that the Indians

writings, as they are usually termed, is devoted to pictures, it may reasonably be concluded that these

and articles have been written about the meaning guesses which have no place in scientific literature.

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

In searching for a key to Indian pictographs,
much importance was attached to the discovery of
a series of winter counts, or “calendars” consisting
of a series of pictures and symbols, each of which
illustrated the chief event of a year. On these winter
counts, were a hundred or more pictures and
symbols, the exact meanings of which were known.
A number of these counts have been reproduced in
ethnological bulletins3 with the meaning of each
design; but only a casual
examination is necessary to
convince one that they fall far
below the level of anything that
might properly be called writing
(Plate 8, Nos. 1, 2, 3). These
simple pictures, or symbols,
seldom have a recognizable
relation to their meaning, and
it is not unusual for one symbol
to be used in several different
places to mean entirely different
things. In only one or two
instances has a symbol reached
the stage of representing the
same idea at all times. At most,
the symbols in these counts
served only as memory helps,
and are of no value whatsoever
in the interpretation of
pictographs.

knowledge and application, their correct
interpretation might be accomplished. As a matter
of fact, some of the interpretations offered by “oldtimers” are said to have been arrived at by this very
knowledge. The writer has carefully examined a
number of these pictographs and their alleged
meanings based on the sign language, and has failed
to be convinced. The sign language, as is well
known, consists chiefly of positions and movements

Even if these few winter
counts had proved to be true
pictographic writing, they
could not have applied to
pictographs made by Indians of
a different language; and,
consequently, only a very few
of the thousands of pictographs
would have been solved by this
means; probably none at all in
the state of Texas.
The almost universal use of
the sign language by Indian
tribes, gave hope that it might
have been incorporated in
pictographs; and through its

PLATE 1.

Pecos River.

A Description of Texas Pictographs
of the hands; consequently, pictographs based on
this language would, necessarily, be made up of
pictures of people with various positions of their
hands or pictures of arms and hands in special
positions. This is not the case with the pictographs
which we have copied in Texas. Many groups of
pictures totally lack recognizable human figures;
and the figures which we have found are, generally,
so highly conventionalized that an interpretation

11

based on the position of the hands, would be
absolutely absurd. In the light of our investigation,
thus far, it seems most unlikely that the Indians of
Texas made use of the sign language in creating
their pictographs.
Much reading and personal investigation has
failed to add another clue to the exact meaning of
pictographs, other than those which have just been
discussed. The writer is quite sure the real truth is:
No tribe of Indians in North
America reached the stage of
true pictographic writing; and,
therefore,
no
exact
interpretation can ever be
possible for the thousands of
pictographs in North America.
This opinion, I believe, will be
found general among those who
have approached the subject
from a scientific point of view.
Serious Purpose of
Pictography

PLATE 2.
Designs resembling tri-motored planes in Rattlesnake Canyon.

It does not follow, however,
because we cannot hope to read
Indian pictographs, that they
have no significant meaning, and
that their study is, therefore
useless. The conclusion of some
observers that pictographs
represent no more than idle
markings of the Indian, comes
from lack of investigation, and
is far from the truth. I believe
that a number of different
purposes lie behind their
making. It is quite possible that
some of the simple designs
resulted from no higher purpose
than that which prompts a
school boy to draw pictures on
the side walk with chalk, but,
undoubtedly, in the vast
majority of cases the designs
and pictures have sprung from
a most serious purpose.

12

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

The labor and trouble to which the artist was
put in making many of the designs, is proof enough
of their serious purpose. The elaborate petroglyphs
near Van Horn are carved so deeply into the hard
rock that weeks or even months of patient labor
with primitive tools, must have been required for
their making. The pictures in almost every cave in
Val Verde county, extend far above the reach of a
man standing on the floor of the cave, so a ladder
of some kind must have been required for their
painting. In a few cases they were painted flat on
the ceiling more than ten feet above the floor. This
work would certainly have required some type of
scaffolding. Grinding, mixing, and applying the paint
on certain of the figures in these caves, must have
required considerable labor, as they stand more than
nine feet tall, are painted solid on rough surfaces,
and are finished in three shades of color.

These designs occur in Texas chiefly among the
petroglyphs near Van Horn and the pictographs of
the cave dwellers in Val Verde county, at locations
where we have sufficient evidence to believe that
the Indians who made them had permanent
settlements. It does not seem reasonable that these
Indians could have needed a map to direct them
over their own familiar territory; and it is even more
unreasonable to think that they would prepare a
map for the use of strangers who would almost
certainly be their enemies. The very idea of
prehistoric Indians making and using maps, as we
know them, seems most unlikely to me. We have
copied many of these designs and have found that,
at least in Val Verde county, their form and general
arrangement suggests illustrations of some myth
or religious idea in which the wavy lines represent
serpents, or perhaps spiritual power.

An excellent example of these map like designs,
and one which is locally explained as a map, may

was practiced.
Ceremonial Designs

Indian Maps
One type of simple design common to both
petroglyphs and pictographs throughout the
country, consists of wandering, wavy lines
connected to one another or to unrecognizable
objects. These rambling designs resemble, in a
superficial way, the rivers and lakes on a
conventional map, and are usually classed as Indian
maps. Attempts are made to relate their principal
lines to the outstanding features of the surrounding
country.

The Necessity of Getting the
Indians’ Point of View
This practice of classifying every wavy-line
pictograph as an Indian map, calls attention to one
of the greatest hindrances to a correct understanding
of Indian customs and beliefs, as well as, Indian
pictures. It is that natural tendency every one has
to attempt to explain everything he sees or hears
by his own personal knowledge and experience. We
are prone to give meanings to Indian pictures based
on the objects and practices of our culture, which
were entirely unknown to the prehistoric Indian.
The great difficulty is in laying aside our advanced

A Description of Texas Pictographs
knowledge and seeing the pictures with only the
eyes of a primitive man. The very fact that almost
every one thinks that pictographs will some day be
read, is a good example of this natural tendency.
The art of reading and writing is so deeply set in
the pattern of our lives that we instinctively feel
that every series of pictures or symbols is a form of
writing. We can hardly place ourselves in the
position of the Indian who probably never thought
of writing in its true sense, and
whose pictures and designs
represent only a crude type of
illustration and symbolism.

copies; yet I believe that it is possible by sincerely
striving to assume the Indian’s point of view, to
arrive at the true significance and purpose behind
many of the Indian pictographs.
No great amount of study or understanding
should be necessary to classify most of the designs
of the Val Verde Dry Shelter Culture as
mythological illustrations. Its typical

Another of the many
examples of this, we met with
at Rattlesnake Canyon near
Langtry. We were asked if we

airplanes on the shelter wall.
We had. But the designs
referred to, which were good
representations of tri-motored
planes, proved, by comparison
with other similar designs, to
be highly conventionalized
pictures of men wearing winglike costumes (Plate 2, Nos. 1,
5).
Even in copying the Indian
pictures, I find it necessary at
all times to be on my guard
against this tendency, lest I
make something out of dim
designs which is not actually
there, but only supplied by my
imagination. However, when
the right attitude has been
attained, I find that I can
approach my work with a
feeling that must resemble that
of the original artist. Although
I have not had the time
necessary for an exhaustive
study of the meaning of
pictographs, due to our
concentrated efforts to secure

anthropomorphic figure holding a staff in one hand
and a broken flower in the other, which is found on
the walls of almost every occupied cave in the
district, could hardly represent anything except a
god or mythological character (Plate 3, No. 2).
Many other conventionalized animals, men, and
designs, repeated many times in the pictographs of
the culture, must undoubtedly illustrate well
established ideas or myths.

doubt, was to illustrate some special event in the
life of the artist which he probably recounted to his
audience in an outburst of oratory when the picture
was made—a speech which could be repeated as
often as the occasion permitted.
Sympathetic Magic
Certain of the animal pictures among the
pictographs must have resulted from the Indians

It is not, however, my purpose
to elaborate on these pictographs
in this paper. I have planned,
instead, to devote an entire article
to the pictures of this remarkable
culture when our survey in that
district is completed.
Illustrations of Brave Deeds
Illustrative pictographs are
found at most locations; but the
ones at Paint Rock and Meyers
Springs are especially interesting.
They consist of several pictures,
usually in one color, grouped
together to illustrate a single
incident (Plate 2, Nos. 6, 10).
Instead of illustrating myths like
the anthropomorphic figures
mentioned above; they picture
hunting, fighting, dancing scenes,
and other every day affairs. Some
show a deer being shot with bow
and arrow; others a buffalo
pursued by Indians on horseback.
At Meyers Springs we can see a
man on horseback beleaguered by
four Indians on foot; two men
fighting a duel with guns; an old
stage coach drawn by a horse; a
man in high top Spanish boots; and
several groups of dancing figures.
None of these pictographs show
signs of great age; and all probably
are the work of Apaches or
Comanches in historic time. The
object of these pictures, without

belief in sympathetic magic. According to this belief,
painting or viewing pictures of animals on the
shelter wall insured success in finding and killing
the animals. Else, why the many little animal pictures
on the ceilings of low shelters in the Davis
Mountains; and the pictures of droves of deer, each
pierced with a spear, in the shelters of Val Verde
county? At least two of the anthropomorphic figures
of the cave dwellers which we have copied, seem
to picture a god-of-the-chase surrounded by animals
pierced with arrows (Plate 6). It is also quite likely
that most of the puma, deer, rabbit, turkey, catfish,
and nondescript animal pictures on the walls of the
flooded shelters in Val Verde county, can be
attributed to this belief in sympathetic magic.

art is a revolt against the impressionistic paintings
of the past generation, and a renewed interest in
the simple art of primitive man. All of which justifies
the question: “How do Indian pictographs rate as
works of art?”
It is most important in this consideration to keep
in mind the broad character of art. We must
remember that no single qualification is essential
to a work of art; and that there are several very
different qualities, any one of which, when present
in a picture or other object, gives it artistic merit.
No one picture or type of picture ever contained
all the qualities which combine to make art. A
picture may be weak or totally lacking in several of
these qualities and yet rank high as a work of art
because of one or more qualities which it does have.
For example: Life-like representation is a very
interesting feature in art, and in certain schools is a
mark of perfection; but it is not absolutely essential.
Many of the priceless masterpieces of the Middle
Ages fall far short in this respect. Pleasing color
harmony is another important quality; but many
drawings and lithographs are true works of art in
one color.

Symbolism, connected in some way with the
Indian superstitions or religion, appears to have
prompted the painting of many designs such as the
so-called sun emblems—variations of stars and
circles—common at every pictograph site; many
of the geometrical forms; perhaps a few of the
animal pictures; and certainly the large thunder birds
so conspicuous on the cliff at Meyers Springs. A

accurate drawing; the one quality most easily
recognized in pictures and the very first quality
looked for by the average observer. This has
seriously affected the interest in pictographs:
because most people, seeing how crude or unlifelike they usually are, have dismissed them as trivial
and inartistic.
It is quite true that the famous paleolithic animal
paintings in Europe far surpass in accuracy anything
produced by the American Indian; but paleolithic
man’s interest was mainly in

Indian, on the other hand, had long

and
was
struggling—unconsciously to be
sure—with the problem of
recording his deeds and thoughts.
His fundamental desire to record
or illustrate, profoundly affected
his attitude toward his pictures. It
took his attention off of accurate
detailed representation, and
focused it on conventionalization
and symbolism. The object of his
pictures in most cases was to
represent an idea or to help him
remember a story or deed. This
encouraged simplification and
brevity which often resulted in
crude drawing. I believe that there
are among his many crude

allowed or not, it must be admitted that many of
the Indian’s simplified forms are skillfully done and
represent no small measure of imagination and taste.
These conventionalized human, animal, and plant
forms occur among the pictographs of every culture
we have studied, and seem to be the result of some
fundamental trait of the Indian mind, rather than
the work of a single culture whose specialty was

need for simple forms for the decoration of baskets
and pots; but pottery is absent at every site we have
studied, and the baskets from the dry shelters where
simplified pictures are found, seldom contain
decorations of any kind. It seems more reasonable
that these highly conventionalized pictures grew out
of the Indian’s unconscious struggle with the
problem of recording his ideas. And had his native
culture not been terminated by white contact, these

17

simple designs may ultimately have formed the basis
of a true system of writing.
The designs and figures of the Val Verde Dry
Shelter Culture are wonderful examples of
conventionalization. They are as individual as the
pictures on a Babylonian temple or those used in
Egyptian heiroglyphs, and, no doubt, represent ages
of evolution from some simple and perhaps more
realistic art (Plates 1, 6, 7).
The writer has thought from the
time he first recognized this
culture, that a definite resemblance
could be seen in its characteristic,
slender figures, to the tall, square
shouldered figures of the Basket
Makers. It seems quite possible
that these Val Verde Dry Shelter
pictures may represent a direct but
much more highly developed phase
of the Basket Maker art. However,
as yet, the writer has studied too
few Basket Maker pictures to offer
this as more than a mere
suggestion. He is anxious to follow
up this idea, because it promises
additional information on the much
debated relationship of our Texas
cave culture, to that of the true
Basket Makers. (Photographs,
tracings or other information about
pictures known to be the work of
the Basket Makers, will greatly
assist in the preliminary work of
this investigation, and will be
gratefully received).
Color Harmony

Color harmony, which is

quality of art, was highly developed
by the Val Verde Dry Shelter
Culture. Its polychrome designs in
from three to five colors, although
unimpressive in their present faded
and mutilated condition, show
remarkable taste in the use of a

limited palette, when they are copied in their original
strength. Not only do we find a pleasing variety
and combination of colors on individual pictures,
but the arrangement of color masses in large groups,
is much more than accidental. It indicates a sense
of color balance unsurpassed by painters of our own
time. Outside of this one culture, however, we have
found only a few polychrome designs that rank high
in color harmony. The best of these are at Paint
Rock. Here we found many small geometrical
designs in three colors that show excellent
discrimination in color arrangement. Polychrome
effects are met with at other locations, due to several
unrelated, one color pictures being painted on the
same wall with different colors. This effect is entirely
accidental, and does not indicate the artist’s sense
of color balance.
Picture Arrangement

training, as does accurate drawing, but springs
spontaneously from within, and is, therefore, an
excellent test of the real esthetic taste of an artist
or a culture. Pictorial arrangement is so little
understood or recognized by the average observer,
that it is likely to be overlooked entirely if attention
is not especially called to it. In this important quality
many Indian pictographs take their place as works
of art. Even the crude pictures at Paint Rock rank
high in this respect. Arrangement is easily studied
at this location because the small ends of the rocks
on which the pictures are painted, serve somewhat
as a frame for the design. Notice how satisfactorily
most of the designs fit into their space, and how
many of them seem to be delicately balanced on
the bottom of the space (Plate 5.) There is also a
pleasing rhythm and flow of lines in many of these
designs that will be apparent to any student of art.

Like color harmony, however, we must go to

is the direction of the leading lines in the picture. It

move a single important element, would seriously
injure their delicate balance and detract from their
artistic merit (Plate 1, No. 1; Plates 6, 7.)

These more subtle artistic
qualities cannot be accurately
described nor definitely pointed
out; but they have been
recognized in our copies of
Indian pictures by almost every
artist who has examined them.
The art of the Indian, like that of
many other primitive people,
though crude, seems to possess
a directness, simplicity, rhythm,
and vitality, which is lost in our
more complex culture; and
which is earnestly sought by
every sincere modern artist.

and of a convenient size, so that they may be

who are interested in basic material on aboriginal

21

TYPOLOGY OF LITHIC ARTIFACTS
BY E. B. RENAUD
INTRODUCTION
Whenever an amateur, a student of archaeology,
or even a trained archaeologist familiar with the
typology of stone artifacts is placed before a large
collection of lithic implements, there is a first
impression of confusion. It is followed by a certain
amount of time, during which the archaeologist
attempts to figure out what the collection consists
of, what it represents, what may be its importance
and scientific value. He tries to pick up, with his
eyes if not actually with his eager fingers, the best,
most ancient, or most significant specimens, the
pieces which are typical or rare. Even after this
preliminary work of sorting out important
implements, or of estimating the value and
significance of the collection, it is not often that
the scientist leaves with a clear conception of the
content and full meaning of the assemblage of
artifacts thus more or less rapidly examined.
As to preparing an inventory of such a collection
of medium or large size, it would take considerable
time and care because requiring, first of all, to sort
out and, then, more carefully to classify, all the
artifacts according to their types, forms or
destinations, and take a census of each class. Only
then would one have obtained a sufficient and usable
knowledge of the collection examined. How much
more rapidly could this be done, how much more
easily could one get at least a fair estimate of the
composition and relative importance of a collection,
if the specimens had been arranged according to a
clear scheme grouping the artifacts of the same kind
together. Under such favorable circumstances, often
an attentive looking over would have sufficed for
ordinary purposes.
But if one is asked to examine an amateur’s
collection he is often faced with an utterly mixed
mass of specimens kept together pro-promiscuously
in boxes without any label of origin, nor the slightest
attempt at classification. To secure any clear idea
of the collection as to types, provenance, and

scientific value, takes a long time and much
patience. It even happens that the owner is not
interested in the rearranging of his collection, which
you think would be an improvement, and for some
vague personal reasons he wishes to keep the
artifacts as he has them in certain boxes, although
he may not object to your examining them without
disturbing his own grouping and arrangement. If
only each box represented a site or group of sites
there would be no objection, on the contrary, this
would help to furnish some information as to origin.
But, frequently, the sorting is only to keep the black
arrowheads together, and separated from the gray
or the brown ones. Or else the specimens are solidly
wired on cards or boards, which damages the edges
of fine points; or they are glued, which prevents
freely examining both faces. What is even worse is
the case of the amateur, artistically inclined, who
arranges his artifacts according to some geometric
pattern, pleasing to him, but completely
disregarding type or origin of specimens. Finally,
the worst offender is the one who used his
arrowheads or other small pieces to represent a bird
or an Indian profile with feathers and all. Then it is
nearly maddening to attempt examining, and
especially counting the number of each type.
In all fairness, one must not censure the amateur
archaeologist for the lack of system in the
classification of his specimens and for the kind of
preservation and presentation of his collection. In
fact, he collects arrowheads and other artifacts
mostly, or even exclusively, for his own satisfaction
and enjoyment, without scientific pretense. Besides,
by the fact that he diligently collects the implements
to be found in his district and preserves them, and
then allows the professional scientist to examine
them and survey his collection, he indirectly renders
a service to science. He furnishes material
information utilizable by the trained archaeologist,
thus increasing the knowledge of the lithic industry
of the region. Moreover, there are intelligent
collectors, who have received some instruction in

collecting, preserving, classifying and presenting
specimens, who avoid the main sins reported above
and others of similar kind. It is, then, a real joy for
the scientist who is given the privilege of seeing
such a collection.

hoped that the following attempt at a clear and
relatively simple classification will be of assistance
to all those who collect and handle lithic
implements.

In public collections, as seen in museums of
scientific standing, the specimens are displayed at
least according to fairly good methods. The main
criticism is here directed at the labeling. Very often
it is insufficient as to needed information to serve
any educative or scientific purpose. Not infrequently
the designation is lax or incorrect because of
ignorance or carelessness. It also happens that
grouping by type or origin is neglected. All these
faults and others lessen the true value of such
collections. In the better museums, where the one
in charge of exhibits both knows and cares, the
artifacts are displayed by sites or districts and by
types; they are clearly and accurately labeled, in
such a way as to show the specimens at their best
and with the proper labels easily readable. In some
other museums where the purpose of educating the
public and serving the students predominates, a
careful selection of only the most typical artifacts
is displayed, showing the order of successive
cultural phases, or the evolution in time. In drawers,
placed immediately below each section of the
exhibit, there is a wealth of other specimens,
showing all the main types and their proportionate
importance in number. An easy and truly scientific
study can then be made in a minimum time of the
lithic industry of any period, or culture phase, or
district, as well as of the various types of artifacts,
the time of their appearance, vogue and decline, as
well as the concomitance of other implements used
parallelly with them. Such well prepared and
therefore, highly reliable, and usable, displays
require of the curator a thorough knowledge of
typology among other things. But, even an
elementary acquaintance with the various types of
stone implements is necessary to students and
collectors. Unfortunately, this is difficult to obtain
from books, because apparently the authors are not
interested in teaching a basic typology, systematic
and logical, such as would be so helpful to the
college student, the museum man, and the intelligent
layman interested in Indian artifacts. It is, therefore,

Principle of Classification
All classification must be simple enough to be
understood by every person of average intelligence,
clear and logical enough to be easily remembered,
and practical so that it can readily be used. In order
to realize these three principal requirements, such
classification must be inspired by a broad and natural
principle, a safe guide good for all ordinary types
of artifacts. No basis seems safer nor more
acceptable than the consideration of the primary
needs of primitive man, ancient or relatively
modem. He obviously made all his implements to
answer his immediate wants and, therefore, to
classify lithic artifacts on the basis of their purpose
or destination, recognized or reasonably postulated,
appears logical and safe.
This also leads the archaeologist to designate
stone implements, and others as well, by the names
describing better their action and purpose such as:
percutor, grinder, scraper, borer, etc.; or by common
words understood of all such as: hammer, knife,
drill, etc. Whenever, a distinction must be
established between subdivisions of the same
general kind of tools, the original designation of
the type can be compounded to make clear, for
instance, the working edge or part of the specimen
of special importance, as is the case for end-chopper
and side-chopper, or end-scraper and side-scraper.
Again, the brief description of the shape of the
working edge may be added to the generic term in
the form of an adjective such as: convex, straight,
or concave scraper. Or else the shape of a tool will
be clearly enough designated by stating that it is,
for instance, a flake end-scraper, a blade endscraper, a core end-scraper, etc. Usually such a way
of proceeding is simple and sufficient for ordinary
designation of the most common artifacts. Fanciful
appellations, as sometimes used by untrained
persons, are unscientific, rarely justified, seldom
clear or acceptable. Terminology must be as simple,
clear and practical as possible; it must designate,
whenever possible, the purpose or use of the

implement, or its shape or size, or its appearance
and way of making. This is to say that it must
contribute to make it known by its mere name,

duplication and fancy.

23

amateur archaeologist and collector, and many
students, will do better to stay with a simpler and
generally sufficient terminology and means of
classification. And this is the main scope of this
attempt at designating and classifying stone
artifacts, principally, although a few words may

of being exclusive of any other method having

own purpose. It only tries to simplify, coordinate,
and so to render clearer and easier the study of
typology and classification of stone artifacts.
Classification of Stone Artifacts
The following classification of stone artifacts—
and some allied forms in wood, bone, horn and later
metal—is mainly based on the elementary needs of
man and the ways of using the implements to realize
the end wanted. The first time I came upon the idea
was while listening to an excellent lecture given by
the veteran Belgian archaeologist, the late Professor
Rutot, in his laboratory of the Royal Museum of
Natural History at Brussells. His demonstration of
the way of holding and using the main types of
Paleolithic artifacts made it clear to me that they
could all be classified under four principal heads,
namely: breaking, cutting, scraping and boring. Ever
since that time I have used that simple and natural
division in teaching the uses and forms of lithic tools.
The following synopsis is nothing more therefore,
than the summary of such a course, based on the
idea of the primary needs of man. It is somewhat
extended to comprise a few allied implements and
derived weapons. Each point will later be further
explained and discussed.

I. First class of implements, for breaking.
The first class of implements answers the primary
need of breaking, which comprises also crushing,
grinding, pulverizing, according to the degree if
separation and fineness of the resulting fragments
and parts of the things either broken or crushed.
This leads to the formation of two subdivisions
owing to the difference in the action and the results:
A. Percutors; B. Grinders.
A. Percutors. The action of the percutors is
essentially due to a downward motion. The results

25

of this action depend, outside the resistance offered
by the thing to be broken or crushed, upon the
weight of the tool to which is added the energy of
the man handling the percutor according to his
strength and his anticipation of the resistance which
he wishes to conquer. Thus in the operation of a
percutor, as will also be seen, in the operation of
any tool or weapon, must be considered the
direction and nature of the motion, the fitness of
the implement to answer the desired results and
the contribution of energy by the man wishing to
pound, cut, scrape, bore or throw.
At the beginning, for a long period, and still
occasionally now, the most common percutors were
stones, any stone or fragment of rock. In regard to
the objects to be broken, cracked, or crushed, the
stone had to be of sufficient hardness. In regard to
the man, the percutor had to be of a size that could
be efficiently held in one, or in some cases, in both
hands, and yet when in direct pounding, not hurt
or wound the hand of the operator. Naturally, for
these reasons, river pebbles were preferred because
of having ordinary size, and a rounded shape that
gave protection to the hand. Their varied forms;
round, oblong, pointed or almond-shaped, spherical
or flattish, answered early specialization of needs
and actions. They required no flaking nor pecking
for accommodation to their purpose and use. They
practically are “eoliths”, that is to say, stones as
found in nature and utilized by man without retouch.
They became regular implements when
systematically used. We recognize them as true
tools, and they are distinguished from other river
pebbles, by the many scars left along their edges or
at the working end as marks of use caused by
pounding hard substances such as bone, shell, stone.
This was often done on a flat stone of convenient
size serving as an anvil. Scars proving such use are
concentrated over a small area, on the central part
or toward one end of the stone employed in this
passive capacity. Frequently on the camps of the
Western Plains, and this is true elsewhere, manos,
the one-hand type here, show evident traces of
having been used as pounders for operations not
requiring heavy mauls nor stronger hammer-stones.
The scars are seen grouped at one end, sometimes

camps of the High Western Plains we have seen
and collected exclusively a type which can be called
the “one hand” mono. It is made of a pebble or a
stone often shaped by pecking. It is subrectangular
in general shape, sometimes roundish or oblong.
Its size, in width and thickness, permits it to be
easily held in one hand. It is often made of a
quartzite pebble, a piece of sand stone, or other
fairly hard rocks.

The grinding stones of the Pueblo area are of a
more advanced type and generally better shaped.
The mano is of the “two hand” type, longer and
broader than the one-hand type of the Plains. It is
operated by an alternate motion: “down and
outward,” then “up and inward.” To the weight of
that relatively large mano is added the pressure of
the hands of the woman kneeling behind the metate
and exercising a forward and then backward
movement on the inclined metate. The metate is
generally a larger and especially heavier stone than
the one used on the Western Plains. It most often is
rectangular in shape. The surface of one type is
either straight and uniform or somewhat concave
from end to end. A more frequent type displays a
fairly deep and rectangular groove within which
the two hand mano functions in straight line. Several
metates of different degrees of grain fineness are
often placed side by side with vertical slabs of stone
separating them and holding the flour from the
ground corn at the lower end of the metate, thus
forming a sort of box or cist. In Mexico the metate
is supported at the desired angle by short feet.
Various stones were used in the making of manos
and metates according to the material at hand.
Rough grain lava was also used.

The “metate” is a slab of stone, most often
rather thin and transportable; other times thick and
heavy. Many are irregular in shape, others have been
broken or pecked into either a roughly rectangular
or an oval shape. On one face, more rarely on both
faces, there is a certain amount of broad pecking
made to increase the grinding efficiency of the
metate rubbed by the mano. This grinding surface
forms a generally very shallow and oval trough.
The observation of the surface of the metates and
of the faces of the manos, often rounded and as if
“warped,” suggests that the grinding was done by
rotative motion over the metate and a “wavy”
motion of the mano, contrary to what is known of
the grinding operation of the Pueblos, for instance.
It happens at times that a thin slab metate has been
so intensely used on one or both faces that the mano

The evolution of the flake into a blade which
was a true knife is illustrated by the flints of the
Aurignacian phase of the Late Palaeolithic. It really
began with the Audi type, still a flake but
consistently oblong and usually pointed, although
not yet a standardized narrow blade. Then the
Chatelperron type, a true knife blade, long, narrow,
usually pointed, with a nearly straight or slightly
convex cutting edge, and a blunted back. It was
then fully characterized and specialized; it remains
the prototype of all ordinary knife blades to the
present. Passing from the early to the late
Aurignacian we see the Gravette type, smaller, finer,
narrower and sharp pointed. It is more a long,
slender point than a true knife, although its edge is
sharp and cutting, it could not be used for rough
work. It is the original pen-knife blade. The later
Magdalenian phase had blades also, but often
double edged. In the various cultures of the
Mesolithic stage we recognized the descendants of
the Aurignacian blades, or at least similar forms,
with partial or whole blunted back, with pointed or
square end, and the general tendency of the time
toward microlithic proportions.

archaeological survey, I never employ the term knife
as a heading of classification and tabulation. The
reasons have already been given. Besides blunt back
blades obviously made for knives, how many good
flakes have been utilized as primitive cutting edges,
although not specialized and standardized knives?
How many sharp edged side scrapers have, besides
their obvious destination, served for cutting? Again,
how many biface blades, especially those provided
with a stem for hafting in a handle, or mounting on
a shaft, are weapon heads or really knife blades?
Or, if primarily javelin, dart, or spear heads, have
they occasionally been used for cutting when
expedient? Those are difficult questions to answer
accurately and liable to subjective interpretation.
This would naturally vitiate the results of tabulation,
statistics and comparisons, whereas when dealing
with other artifact types, such as end-choppers, for
example, there is little chance for error; with sidescrapers, when fairly straight or slightly concave,
an element of doubt already enters, although with
some, such as those of the Mousterian type, there
is less uncertainty. These are problems for a
systematic report of stone artifacts by types.

The Solutrean culture, with its more complex
technique of pressure retouch, and biface forms,
produced larger blades, often leaf-shaped, which
could well be used as efficient knives. Many similar,
although not as beautifully made, biface blades
appeared later in the cultures of Neolithic types.
Some such artifacts have been found almost
everywhere in North America either in agricultural
areas like the Mound region and the Southwest or
on the camps of the Western Plains, as well as in
Mexico where they sometimes bore artistic handles.
There also splendid unretouched blades, obtained
by a skillful blow given at a certain point on the
edge of the striking platform of an obsidian core,
produced those efficient knives used in human
sacrifices. The two main types of knives had thus
survived side by side. There are also bone knives
of various forms such as were used by some Indian
tribes and the Eskimos; and possibly others made
of horn or hard wood.

2. Incising is nothing but a shallow cutting, not
penetrating very deep below the surface, not going
entirely through the piece incised. It may be done
on stone, bone, horn, shell or wood, that is to say
resistant materials, and later on metals. It requires
a point sharp enough to cut and penetrate a hard
surface, and strong enough to conquer the
resistance of the substance incised without easily
breaking, denting or blunting the sharp edge or point
of the graver or burin.

At the beginning, almost any point of flint or
other lithic material was probably used, producing
a more or less irregular and shallow groove or
incision, and all too rapidly losing the shape or
sharpness of its working tip. This, by experience,
probably lead to the selection of forms more
resistant or penetrating, better adapted to its
purpose, and, finally to the creation of a specialized
tool embodying the required qualities and,
moreover, easily re-shaped. That is the “burin,” so

paintings show us the use of the sickle in the Nile
Valley. The scythe works on the same principle, but
the blade is much larger and the handle, placed at a
different angle, is much longer and provided with a
side hold. It is operated with two hands instead of
one for the sickle. Modern machinery has replaced
those implements.
C. The third means of cutting is by percussion
downward. It may be applied directly or indirectly.
1. The two principal tools used in indirect
percussion downward are the wedge and the chisel.
They may be made of a variety of materials
depending upon what nature furnishes man and the
resistance of the substance to be cut, split, or sliced.
Thus, according to place, tribe and culture, hard
wood, antler, bone, stone, and later metals are used.
Both tools are essentially of the same type. Their
body and butts must be strong enough to stand the
blows of the hammer or mallet. Their tapering
working end must be sharp enough to penetrate
the resisting material to be split by the wedge, cut
or chipped by the chisel. They were mostly used in
working wood and stone. They are frequently seen
in the forest-cultures of Northern Europe and the
Indians of the N. W. Pacific coast employed them
in the construction of their large wooden canoes
and of their plank or board houses. The Egyptians
also made use of them in quarrying slabs of stone
and in building. Some are found on old Indian
quarries. Rough tools of stone, shaped like wedges
and chisels, with round or squarish butts bearing
marks of having been pounded upon, whereas the
tapering ends show signs of use on hard substances,
are found in Old Stone Age cultures. Some
implements of this kind have been collected here
and there on camp sites of the Western Plains and
especially among the older series of the Black’s Fork
culture of Southwest Wyoming. Some have a fairly
sharp working end, either flat and relatively thin,
or else stouter and prismatic; others are more blunt
and roundish. Some gouges may be considered as
members of this group.
2. The implements used for cutting, splitting and
slicing by direct application of downward
percussion comprise three related classes, (a)
cleaver and chopper; (b) hatchet and axe; (c) adze,
gouge, hoe.

31

Large flakes with a straight or slightly convex
edge, sharp and strong enough, were used as
cleavers during the Old Stone Age and even later.
They were firmly held in hand and for that reason
the back edge had to be blunted to prevent hurting
the hand. Probably it was principally used for cutting
meat, dividing a carcass or larger sections of animal
into portions that could more easily be handled,
just as is still done today by butchers with a similar
implement of metal with a handle. The weight of
the cleaver, and even more, its sharpness, together
with the force of the hand working it by means of a
downward stroke, allowed it to cut or cleave neatly
bones, joints, tendons and meat attached. It
functions like a hafted hatchet on wood. Stone
cleavers and choppers are handleless hatchets.
The choppers are usually heavier than cleavers
and also more varied in shape. There are side
choppers, end choppers, and others more
extensively trimmed to serve either way. Whereas
cleavers are more often big flakes, choppers more
frequently are river pebbles or large fragments, with
a minimum amount of broad flaking done by
percussion. When this trimming is concentrated at
one end, making it straight or somewhat convex, it
serves as an end chopper, or hand axe, for cutting,
splitting, chopping wood, horn or bone. From the
fact that it is not hafted with a long handle, it has
less force to accomplish its purpose than the true
axe. Some pointed forms could be efficiently used
to crack, break or split hard objects. In conjunction
with a mallet or a hammer stone they could break
open large, hard nuts, or split big long bones to
extract the marrow. The Asturian industry
comprised a number of these tools, pointed or
otherwise. Some have been found on our Western
campsites. The Black’s Fork culture of Southwest
Wyoming had a variety of end choppers made of
large quartzite pebbles with roughly straight
working edges, or convex, even fan-like, and some
pointed ones.
It also contained a goodly number of side
choppers. The same kind of big river pebbles had
been trimmed by means of bold flaking along part,
or all of the lengthwise edge, giving an oblique, or
convex working edge. Thanks to the naturally
roundish or oval shape of the pebble, having kept

32

its original cortex, the hand got a good grasp of
these tools without danger of wounding itself when
holding and using them. It imparted to them a strong
downward movement which, added to the weight
of the implement, and the stoutness of the edge,
rendered them quite efficient for cutting, breaking,
splitting wood, bone or horn. Modern metal
choppers of different forms are still used in various
trades. The early Palaeolithic coups-de-poing were
certainly employed as cleavers and choppers, as is
proved by an inspection of the traces of use along
their edges, especially along the upper part of one
side nearing the tip. Cleavers and choppers must
have been important tools before the invention of
the true and hafted hatchet and axe.

The term celt is used by some archaeologists
for designating a stone implement with a double
possibility. Hafted so that the cutting edge of the
tool was in the same direction as the axis of the
handle, it really was an axe. When hafted so that
the working edge was in a transverse position, or
crosswise in regard to the handle, it was called an
adze. In other words it is essentially the same
implement used in two different ways for two
diverse purposes or functions. Like the axe, the adze
is principally a woodman’s tool, or, an instrument
employed by those building a boat or a dwelling.

The hoe is an agricultural implement of the same
general nature as the adze but used for cultivating.

The main differences between a knife and a side
scraper are: First, that the knife is essentially a blade
whereas the scraper is a flake. Second, the knife
blade in order to penetrate more easily, must be
smooth on both faces, thin and narrow, V-shaped
in cross-section; the scraper on the other hand is
smooth on the ventral face; has one bevel, along
the edge on the dorsal face, and the angle of that
working edge generally is greater than that of the
knife, since the scraper is often thicker. However,
a sharp side scraper can easily function, if need be,
as a cutting edge or knife. On the other hand, a
knife blade is too narrow to be easily handled as a
side scraper and the edge too thin to stand much of
the hard work of a scraper.
B. The end-scraper is a different tool from the
side scraper. Not only is its working edge at the
narrow end instead of the broad side, but its shape
is essentially different. The class more closely
resembling the other kind of scraper is that of the
end scraper on a flake usually of a small size. It is
roughly circular or subtriangular, and often thin.
The working edge is limited to a flat roundish
portion of the contour of the flake, and it was held
with the thumb placed over the dorsal face of the
tool, for that reason it was frequently termed a
thumb-scraper. The scraping end is shaped by the
pressure method, producing fine flaking along a
sharp edge. The typical late Paleolithic end scraper
is on a blade with the same fine pressure flaking
forming the working part of the implement. The
blade, of various sizes, is triangular or trapezoidal
in cross-section, and constitutes a small tool easily
held between the thumb and the index finger. Some
of the blades, usually somewhat larger than the
ordinary, are constricted or strangulated back of
the working part, either to facilitate holding or for
hafting in the hollow shaft of a long bone, serving
as handle. Other times the opposite end of the
scraper is pointed, and can be used as a borer or as
a burin or graver. In certain cases, as seen in the
Solutrean industry, the dorsal face is more or less
flaked. Many of the end scrapers, either from the
Old or the New World, are among the finest artifacts
of the Stone Age on account of the minute and
ribbon-like pressure flaking of their working ends.
Such are frequently found on the camp sites of the
Western Plains.

Besides the flake and blade varieties of end
scrapers, there are others such as the carinate, or
keel-shaped, scraper with a stout nose or end made
for hand work on resistant material. They abound
in the Middle Aurignacian phase, and are not
unknown in America. A few scrapers, some on flake,
more often on irregular blades, or even carinate,
have their working edge concentrated on a narrow,
flat or high, end or nose, for some finer and special
purpose. Small cores, pyramidal in shape, with a
flat and smooth under surface, are also used as end
scrapers of the nuclei form type. Large, strong and
often roughly made end scrapers, high in profile,
are better called plane, or planning tools, although
operating along the same principle.
The irregularly shaped and rather rough end
scrapers of the early stages of the stone age seem
related to the end choppers, the same as the side
scrapers appear as a specialization of the cleaver,
both strong and sharp flakes, although for another
kind of operation.
IV. Fourth Class of Implements, for Boring
This last group of artifacts comprises all types
of borers or Perforators, that is to say tools the
function of which is to pierce or produce a hole
through a variety of materials. This can be
accomplished in three different ways according to
necessity: by a blow; by pressure; by rotation.
A. By a blow. This is done with the aid of a
punch. This is a tool essentially made of a tip or
point more or less acute and a body fairly strong to
resist the rather sharp and violent push or blow on
the butt end or handle and the impact of the point
with the substance to be perforated. Usually it is a
one-piece artifact firmly held in the hand that gives
the impulse or driving force; however, a mallet
could have been used to strike the butt and drive
the perforating point through the material to be
bored or punctured. The tip of the implement if it
is too sharp or brittle, is easily broken or blunted in
the impact by the resistance of the substance to be
bored. As the resilient quality of horn renders it
desirable for such a tool, the prong of an antler has
often been employed as a punch.

Typology of Lithic Artifacts
B. By pressure. Awls and bodkins are the sharp
pointed instruments used, by means of pressure of
the hand, for piercing or making small holes in skin,
leather or wood. In all primitive cultures, be it of
hunters, fishermen or early agriculturists, bone awls
are numerous. They were made of a fragment of
long bone sharpened at one end, the sides of the
shaft were smoothed so as not to hurt the hand
which held it firmly to exercise pressure to force
the awl or bodkin through the substance to be
pierced. Often a leg bone of a medium or small
sized mammal or bird was preferred with one
articulation being left on for a handle, which was
round, smooth and gave a good grasp to the hand.
The other end was sharpened, usually by rubbing
on sandstone.

with fairly sharp edges adding abrasion to the
penetrating power of the tip. These drills are not
infrequently found broken because of the fragility
of the stem, it being not strong enough to resist
both the pressure and twist applied to the drill, and
the resistance of the stone.
A variety of improvements and inventions are
found in several Indian and Eskimo cultures, such
as the use of the bow to facilitate the rotation of a
shaft with a sharp stone or metal drill point; the
addition of a weight to increase the pressure
downward, as is also done by application of the
chest or mouth.
When drills were used to perforate an object of
stone too thick to be pierced only from one side,
the operation was restarted from the other face.
The resulting hole is roughly shaped like two hollow
cones connected at their apices, not always very
correctly owing to some miscalculation or deficient
workmanship.

A two piece awl could be obtained by forcing a
sharp point of bone, flinty material, or a pointed
tooth, into the tubular part of a small leg bone with,
or without, the articulation left on to act as handle
in the manner previously described. It could also
be mounted on a strong wooden shaft allowing

Weapons
After the synopsis of the classification of stone
artifacts, a short list of weapons derived from tools
has been presented following the same principle of
classification as used for the implements. Although
rather sketchy, it may suffice to suggest the relations
of the original stone tools to the more specialized
weapons for hunting and war. To enter into more
details of description and discussion would require
a special study not intended here.

the points, deserves particular attention.

spiral in shape, and the diverging edges really are
the working parts of that useful tool. In some phases
it is fairly well flaked on the dorsal face. The other
kind has such an acute tip that this point could be
used as a perforator to pierce skin or leather, and
the edges being very sharp could cut or scrape. It
could be made use of as a weapon and its triangular
shape suggests already the later spear head. The
dorsal face and the edges are less retouched than
the preceding variety, or double edge scraper.
Sometimes the bulb of percussion was knocked off
to reduce the thickness of the base and probably
for hafting.

from other offensive stone points. This came about

the classes or types and sub-types of points to the

create whatever subdivisions he needed to suit the

description.

“Starting from the idea that to answer all

“The first development out of the preceding type
can easily be conceived as the production of a stem

on the end of a wooden shaft. This would likely
begin by a short, embryonic stem, hardly projecting
from the base line; then it would be more clear cut,
progressively longer, broader, and varying in shape,

But all stems would be narrower than the maximum

characteristic easy to recognize. All arrowheads
displaying such a feature are called STEMMED
points and constitute our TYPE 2, a logical
evolution from the stemless Type 1, according to
technology and typology. Chronologically this
remains to be proved by a series of well-dated finds.

“Thus, by classifying a point as being stemmed
or belonging to Type 2, the collector may add any
or all features mentioned and possibly others. This
does not change the system of classification, it
merely supplies details indicating individual
variations of type and it makes the description more
complete.
The TYPE 3, apparently is a more advanced
kind, generally shaped with care and skill. It
comprises all BASED arrowheads, those having a
base as broad or more often broader than the width
of the body of the point. This is a clearly
distinguishing feature if compared with Type 2 with
stem narrower than the body of the arrowhead.
Besides, Type 3 has notches leading to the
recognition of the two sub-types.

“Sub-type A has “Lateral notches,” or two small
notches, usually rounded, placed one on each edge
or side, merely interrupting the outline of the point,
which, otherwise, would continue to the base. The
base is thus clearly marked off from the body of the
point, and this helps in readily recognizing the
specimens of this class, for which the abbreviation
is L. N. for “lateral notches.” The base line may be

FIRE IN EAST TEXAS BURIAL RITES
BY A. T. JACKSON
Fire frequently played a prominent part in the
burial rites of the Indians in East Texas. This is
proved by various archaeological finds, and verified
by certain historical accounts. The situation here is
similar to that in widespread areas elsewhere, but
there are certain local variations.

The use of fire in burial ceremonies took on
different forms. Most common among such
evidences, are the presence of charcoal in the grave
soil, ashes alone, ashes and charcoal combined,
charred articles of food, and cremations. The
frequency of occurrence varies. While few in
numbers, cremations are an outstanding
manifestation of this culture trait.

were broken or split; and were
heavily incrusted with ashes, but
not charred. A small mussel shell
(Unio sp.) was ground down at one
edge, as if to convert it into a
spoon.
Beneath the center of this ash
heap, at a depth of eight feet nine
inches, was a somewhat crudely
chipped chert blade. About nine
inches to the northeast of the blade
was a lump of used red ochre,
about 2 x 1 x 1 inches. As these
two specimens were 20 inches
below the ash heap, it at first
seemed unlikely that they had any
relation. Subsequent finds forced
a different conclusion.

stratum of red sand, just above hard-packed goldenyellow clay. The diameter of this ash heap was only
19 inches. It was slightly convex, being about two
inches thick at the center and one inch at the edges.
A small amount of burnt earth, lumps of clay and
charcoal were present in the ash. The ash contained
one potsherd, a fragment of the cannon bone of a
deer and pieces of several small mussel shells. There
were no artifacts, nor evidence of human remains,
in the ashes. A deep layer of clay beneath was
confined to the small area covered by the ash heap.

At a depth of ten inches beneath the ash heap,
near its center, was a grooved iron-stone pebble,
imbedded in a heap of charcoal. The stone has three
deeply cut lines or grooves, running lengthwise and
almost converging at the rounded point, dividing it
into three more or less equal parts. The grooves
are about two inches in length and 1-4 inch deep. A
fourth groove, 1 1-4 inches long, is very shallow
and on the ridge formed by two of the deep grooves.
The stone is in its natural state except for the
grooves and the pointing of one end.

In sandy soil intermixed with small lumps of
charcoal were 30 chert chips, a few of which
showed secondary chipping on
one edge. They were on a level
with, and to the east of, the
charcoal deposit in which the
projectile point was found.
The charcoal deposit beneath
the ash heap, at the west side of
the grave, had a diameter of 11
inches. In the mass of charcoal
and burnt earth were about a
dozen carbonized acorns; also a
somewhat charred molar that
appeared to be the tooth of a
youth. A few burnt fragments of
human bones were found in this
deposit. There also were a few
small animal bones, some of
which were not burnt. Fragments
of mussel shells showed no signs
of fire. A lump of burnt clay was
in the mass of charred material.
No pottery vessels, but three
potsherds, were found. One was
above the ash heap, the others
beneath. Undisturbed earth was
found 19 inches below the bottom
of the ash heap, at 135 inches.

broken animal bones may have been food offerings.
The large lump of yellow ochre, found a few inches
above the burial, may have been a special offering.
Seven feet north of No. 2 was a third deposit.
The hard-packed ash was at a depth of 138 inches.
It was only nine inches in diameter and two inches
thick. There was considerable charcoal intermixed
with the ashes. Neither bones nor artifacts of any
kind were found with this deposit. If it represented
a cremation it must have been that of an infant.
Six feet west of No. 2 was the fourth deposit of
this type. It was slightly below a
stratum of yellow clay, at a depth of
121 inches. The dimensions of the
ash heap were 15 x 12 x 1 inches.

and gave forth a distinct ring when struck with a
trowel. Imbedded in the hard crust were particles
of bony material and pieces of charcoal. This ash
heap, like all the others, had the appearance of
having been wet and intentionally packed. The only
artifact was a crude awl made of split deer bone. It
came from a depth of 139 inches, beneath the hard
incrustation. There were the usual fragments of
animal bones, a few mussel shells and charred
acorns. No human skeletal material could be
recognized.
Ten feet west of No. 4 was the sixth deposit, at
a depth of 136 inches. The dimensions were 20 x
15 x 1 1-2 inches. There was less charcoal than in

Considerable charcoal was in and
beneath the hard-packed ash. In the
charcoal, four inches beneath the
ash, was a mussel shell with 14 small
notches cut at regular intervals
around its edge. Near the mussel
shell were four chert flakes, but no
stone artifacts.
Imbedded in the charcoal were
six large acorns, badly charred. A
few small unburned animal bones
were found. Several fragments of
mussel shells showed no evidence of
fire. There was no discernible trace
of human skeletal remains. If any of
the charcoal represented burnt
human bones it could not be
identified as such. Red sand beneath
the charcoal was baked to a hard
crust.

about. No other offerings were
present, and no identifiable human
skeletal material was found.
Discussion of the Ash Heaps
Five of the six hard-packed ash
heaps were in a direct east-west line
and uniformly spaced.
It seems significant that an
undoubted cremated burial was
found on the Jaggers farm less than
five miles northwest of the Hale
site, and another on the Gait farm,
about 12 miles southwest.
But these ash heaps in the Hale
mound are quite different from the
cremations in the above mentioned
cemeteries. They also are wholly
unlike the ordinary hearths or fire
pits.
Ashes in Non-Cremated Burials
At several places in Northeast
Texas were found graves
containing ashes with noncremated burials. Outstanding
among such places was a burial
mound on the T. M. Sanders farm,
on Bois d’Arc Creek 1-2 mile south
of Red River, and about 20 miles
northwest of Paris, Lamar County,
Texas.

The village site at the Sanders
place occupied two earthen
mounds and a natural ridge
connecting the mounds. Mound
No. 1, to the east, was completely
excavated by the University of
Texas from July 23 to August 28, 1931. The
dimensions of this mound are 175 x 70 x 9 feet.
There was a natural knoll to which the Indians added
several feet of earth. Evidence found in the mound
indicates that it was occupied for a time, was later
inundated and subsequently reoccupied by man.

some of them; the ash was more porous; and the
bony material cemented in a brick-like manner.
There were fewer charred acorns, more mussel
shells and about the same number of broken animal
bones. A lump of red ochre was beneath the center
of the ash heap. A few chert flakes were scattered

46

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

In the mound were found 21
graves containing 60 skeletons.
Twelve of the graves, at depths of
8 to 27 inches, had only one
skeleton each. The remaining nine,
at depths of 24 to 49 inches,
contained 48 skeletons. It will be
noted that most of the group
burials were deep while the single
burials were shallow. Five of the
six graves that contained ashes
were single burials; one contained
a group of four skeletons. The
excellent condition of the skeletal
material indicates no great age,
but there was no evidence of
European contact.
In Burial B-1, at a depth of 15
inches, a single skeleton lay on a
bed of ashes more than an inch
deep. There was some midden
material six inches beneath the
grave. In Burial B-2, at 27 inches,
was a thin layer of ashes under the
hips. The skeleton in Burial B-6,
at 18 inches, was on a thin deposit
of ashes, as also was the one in
Burial B-8, at a depth of 16 inches.
Burial B-11, at 19 inches, had
beneath the skeleton a layer of
ashes one inch deep. The same
was true of B-20, with its intrusion
of three skeletons into an older
single burial.

to be more than a mere coincidence. It also is worthy of the Tejas as follows:

Fire in East Texas Burial Rites
“When a Texa dies away from his family, either
in war or peace, they give him a different funeral. A
stone throw from the house a pyre of wood is
arranged. All present offer to an old priest tobacco
and corn meal. The offering received, they get up,
go around a bonfire, which is lit in the center of the
house, throw into it a part of the offering. Then the
women present, at the same time that they offer
condolences, offer strings of beads, knives and some
clothes. To all of this they add all of the personal
effects of the deceased, and the best gamuzas they
have, wrapping them up in a mat. Then one of the
pallbearers takes the bundle, another a lighted stick
of wood from the fire, and the third a bundle of
dried herbs. They all leave the house in a procession,
arrive at the pyre, set fire to it all over and throw
the wrapped bundle into the bonfire. They execute
all of this according to what they say, so that the
soul of the deceased shall go to the house of
pleasure and so that when it comes to find its body
it may see what has been done in its honor.”

skeleton the outline of the pit continued to a depth
of 4 1-2 feet. The soil in the pit was very dark and
contained much charcoal and potsherd. There also
were present human and animal bones badly
scattered and broken.
Burial C-8, same site, was in a circular fire pit
about four feet in diameter. The actual burial
occupied a space of 36 x 19 1-2 inches. The pit
contained ashes and charcoal surrounding the
skeleton. The bones showed no trace of fire, but
were badly disintegrated. The skeleton had been
crammed into the hole on the right side, the neck
twisted and the face turned to the east. The legs
were flexed.
Near the ankles at the southeast part of the grave
was a buffalo scapula hoeblade. Other artifacts
included a flint awl, three crude projectile points,
red ochre and flint chips—all deposited in a small
pile west of the right shoulder.

Charcoal and Ashes in Pots
At several sites were graves
that contained both charcoal
and ashes. Sometimes they
were intermixed with the soil
of the grave fill. In two cases
the ashes and charcoal were
inside pots.
In July, 1934, a small
cemetery was excavated on the

In the grave that contained the

an earthenware pipe, a polished stone celt
and 22 well made, small arrowpoints. This
suggests that the deceased was a person
of importance, and might explain why it
was desired to protect his body from
direct contact with the soil.
The only comparable grave find in East
Texas, of which the writer knows, was in

County. In it there was a pesthole on one
side of the grave near the waist.
Charcoal as Only Evidence of Fire
Many graves had charcoal in them but
no other evidence of fire. Usually the
charcoal was distributed through the soil
constituting the grave fill. In a few cases
it was deposited on the grave floor. The
charcoal apparently resulted from the
burning of wood.
The most outstanding “charcoal site”
in East Texas that has come under the
writer’s observation is the Mattie Gandy

Reverence for fire was widespread among the
American Indians. Hence it is not surprising to find
similar practices in various parts of Texas, Arkansas,
Louisiana, and elsewhere.
Charcoal in graves and cremated burials have
been reported in Central Texas.4 Cremations and
charcoal in graves likewise have been recorded in
several parts of West Texas.5-9
Moore10 and Lemley11 report cremated burials
on the Crenshaw place on Red River in Miller
County, Arkansas, some fourteen miles east of the
Texas state line. They were in pits cut down into
the mound from the surface. Lemley states: “The
calcined bones were in small fragments. No
evidence of fire was found and apparently the
cremations had been made elsewhere and the
remains thereafter interred in the mound.”
Harrington12 in a report on excavations at Ozan
and Mineral Springs states: “At a depth of four feet
eight inches” (in a mound) “were found two
deposits of charred human bones, approximately
two feet in diameter and two inches thick at the
middle. In one were found two broken arrowpoints
and some fragments of very thin copper ornament;
the other held nothing but the bones.” A burial at
Mineral Springs contained “the calcined remains
of three cremated skeletons—burnt bones and ashes
only—among which appeared a few tiny
arrowpoints more or less cracked by fire.”
The finding of charcoal in graves also has been
reported in widespread areas. Harrington 13
mentioned it at the Washington site in Arkansas.
Moore,14 in discussing his work in Alabama, gives
several interesting examples of the finding of
charcoal.
“In the central part of the mound were five
skeletons associated with charcoal. One of these
skeletons had considerable charcoal near the head.
Charcoal was at the head of another skeleton and
at the feet of a third.” At another site he reports:
“Four feet from the surface, with charcoal above
it, was a full length skeleton on its back.
Immediately by the side” (of that burial) “was an
elongated bunch of bones beneath charcoal.” With

Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, is recorded
by Moore17 as follows: “At the bottom

lay Burial No. 16 extended on the back.
Near the skull were many fragments of
charcoal and some bits of burnt shell and
of calcined bones—which latter have
been determined probably to be not
human, but to belong to the deer.”
Significance of Practices
Many similar cases could be cited, but
these are sufficient to show the
fundamental unity of this cultural practice.
What is the explanation of this
reverence for fire and its use in burial
rites? Yarrow18 suggests that fire was
thought to purify the soul, drive away
demons, furnish light for the journey to
the other world, and heat to cook the food
while on that journey.
Hough19 approaches the subject in a
practical way:

PLATE 16.
Views of four graves found in Cherokee County, Texas,
showing burial furnishings.

“Excavation in the ancient Pueblo
cemeteries invariably show masses of
charcoal and ashes appearing as a layer
in the earth above the skeletons. In some
cases ashes were placed with the bodies
at the time of burial. So far as can be
ascertained there is no present Pueblo
custom by which the ancient custom can
be checked up. Many excavations show

54

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

that burials were made in village rubbish heaps in
which ashes and charcoal are large components,
and in this case it is not always possible to trace the
definite use of charcoal and ashes as in undisturbed
earth. In reconstructing the custom, recourse may
be had to the grave fire of several Indian tribes. It
is presumed that at the time of ancient Pueblo
interment a fire was built near the grave and the
ashes and charcoal thrown in as the excavation was
being filled.
“The custom of burning the belongings with the
dead has wide extension arealy and in time. Some
idea of sacrifice inheres in the custom, and also that
of transmitting the things burnt to the spiritual
world. This custom is often connected with
cremations.”
One may thus see how the facts regarding the
use of fire in burial rites in a given area may dovetail
with those from remote regions.
It is by gathering small bits of evidence and
piecing them together that we may some time have
a fairly complete record of primitive man in
America.

Discovery of Sauk Valley Man of Minnesota

DISCOVERY OF SAUK VALLEY MAN OF MINNESOTA
WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE GEOLOGY
BY KIRK BRYAN, HENRY RETZEK
The discoveries of human remains made in
Minnesota in the past few years promise to give a
series of skeletons, some with associated artifacts,
that will lead to real knowledge of the Late Glacial
and Post-glacial inhabitants of North America. The
discovery in June, 1935, of a skeleton in a gravel
pit near Lake Guerney in West Union Township is
one of this series (Plate 19). The gravel is obviously
of a considerable antiquity as it stands 70 feet above
present drainage and is a mere remnant left by
stream dissection. The skeleton has certain primitive
features not consistent with those of the modern
Indian. A consideration of these circumstances led
to the mapping of the site, and a brief geologic
investigation, the results of which are here set forth.
The discovery was made possible by the prompt
intervention of one of the writers, the Rev. Henry
Retzek, who recognized the probable value of the
skeleton, named it The Sauk Valley Man, and
preserved the skeleton for scientific study. Through
his influence the other two writers who were
inspecting the sites of the Minnesota, and the
Browns Valley men, under the guidance of
Professor A. E. Jenks, became interested in the find.
From the evening of June 26 to July 1, 1935, Bryan
and McCann were the guests of Father Retzek and
are indebted to him for hospitality and for guidance
in the locality.

the loam by spading and throwing it to one side.
They clear the loam to the gravel for a distance of
two or three feet back from the edge and then cave
down the face.
All the workmen agree that the first unusual sight
which attracted their attention was a bone that
projected from the face 2 or 4 feet below the top of
the bank. This bone with two smaller bones were
pulled or fell down the face of the bank. These bones
were thrown to one side into the “rock pile” or
“waste pile” where over-size boulders were
discarded. In the late afternoon of June 11, two
men were on top stripping loam and caving the bank
in. One of them, Earl Tompkins, struck bone as he
thrust his shovel into the gravel below the loam.
He recognized what he had struck, but just then a
large mass of gravel caved and fell, carrying the
bones with it. As it was the end of the day, they all
quit work without looking at this gravel. The next
morning, June 12, they found a skull and other parts
of a skeleton, and laid them to one side until they
were claimed and taken by Daniel W. Fraser to his
home. Each of the workmen has been interviewed
and depositions under oath have been taken. These
individual statements are discussed in later
paragraphs.
Andrew Marthaler notified Father Retzek of the
find on the afternoon of June 12. Retzek went
immediately to the pit, interviewed the men, and
then obtained the bones from Fraser. The following
day he took the photographs which illustrate this
article. On June 17, Retzek and one of the workmen
recovered the long bone and one of the two small
bones from the “waste pile.” The long bone proved
to be a tibia. At various times Retzek searched the
road on which the gravel was used and found some
small pieces of bone.

A gravel pit on the land of Daniel W. Fraser (Lot
1 of NE¼ section 11, T. 127 N., R. 35W) in West
Union Township, Todd County, Minnesota, has
been the source of gravel for the improvement of
the county roads (see Plate 20). The gravel is dug
by hand and the ordinary procedure has been to
shovel from the base of a 20-foot face. As the upper
4 to 6 feet of gravel is slightly cemented, it tends to

to be sent above two or three times a day to strip
well bedded gravel showed no disturbance. There

is no dispute that the first bone seen, the tibia, lay
between 3 and 4 feet below the surface and in the
gravel. Some of the workmen thought that it came
from the rubbly layer of coarser pebbles about 4
feet down, and others from the finer gray layer about
3 feet down. The other bones seem to have been
somewhat shallower but definitely in the gravel
below the humus.
No artifacts were found by the workmen, nor
by Father Retzek, although diligent search was
made for them. The inside of the skull was filled
with packed limonitic sand, which was removed
several days later by Father Retzek.
The circumstances pointing to the conclusion
that the skeleton was entombed in the gravel by
natural processes and that it was not a burial are as
follows: (1) No visible disturbance of an unusually

well-bedded gravel; (2) Disposition of the bones
over a zone from 2 to 4 feet below the surface; (3)
No artifacts, such as would be expected with a
burial; (4) Brain case packed with sand similar to
the rest of the deposit.
On the other hand, no qualified person was
present whose testimony as to lack of disturbance
would be conclusive. The workmen were intent on
their task and only mildly interested in the find. The
detection of an ancient burial, such as that of
Browns Valley man,1 requires close observation.
In that instance only the presence of an acute local
observer with the presence of mind and skill to make
excellent photographs has enabled us to be certain
that Browns Valley man is a burial. In the West
Union find, however, a good observer reached the
pit within a few hours and found no evidence of

Discovery of Sauk Valley Man of Minnesota
burial. The lack of artifacts may be due to loss
through slump despite the diligent search for them.

Character and Credibility of the Witnesses

The workmen were local men laboring on an F.
The fact that the skull was packed with limonitic
E. R. A. project. The group included Ralph Smith,
sand similar to the reddish material exposed at a
foreman, and Romaine Johnson, Ludwig Elven,
depth of 4 feet is evidence not only of the depth of
burial but of antiquity. Under the
present climatic conditions calcium
carbonate is being deposited in the
subsoil. It is found penetrating the
limonitic West Union gravel in
seams. If the skull were a recent
burial, not only would we expect to
find humus with the bones, but also
a lime cement in the sand of the
skull. The skull must have reached
its position in the West Union gravel
during or before the period of
limonite deposition, or previous to
a more humid climate that antedates
the present semi-arid type of
climate.
Prof. A. E. Jenks and Dr. L. A.
Wilford point out in an oral
communication that even if the
skeleton is a burial, it has a
considerable antiquity. The local
Indians were Sioux, established in
the area for some period previous
to 1660 when the historic record
begins. About the end of the 18th
century the Chippewa began to hunt
in this region. The Sioux customarily
buried their dead as bundles of bones
in mounds following exposure of the
body on a scaffold. Jenks and
Wilford point out that so much of
the skeleton of Sauk Valley Man is
represented that the possibility of a
secondary or bundle burial is
precluded, and it is unlikely that this
is a Sioux of the historic period.
Most Chippewa burials in this area
contain objects of European
manufacture, because these Indians,
when they arrived in the area, had
long been in contact with traders.

Melvin Irwin, Earl Tompkins, Martin Brakken, Bob
Iverson, and Teddy Randall. All of them are men of
good repute, whose essential honesty cannot be
questioned. It must be borne in mind, however, that
although they observe natural phenomena as closely
as the typical workman of the countryside, they
were busy with their work and unconscious of the
importance of their find.
Certain discrepancies in their testimony are
apparent, particularly as to the date when the tibia
was discovered. Melvin Irwin claims that on
Tuesday, June 11, he was working on the face of
the pit with a pick, above the shovelers, when he
saw the tibia sticking out “between the red gravel
and the fine sand” about 3 and a half or 4 feet from
the surface. He remembers pulling out the bone and
remarking “looks like we have a dead Indian here”
as he handed it to Smith who tossed it onto the

“waste pile.” Brakken believes the tibia was first
seen on Monday, June 10, because he was present
when this bone was discovered and he did not work
on Tuesday, June 11. Johnson is sure that the day
was either Thursday, June 6, or Friday, June 7. He
remembers that Brakken was working alongside
of him and Melvin Irwin on the face of the pit when
the long bone, with the two small ones, fell down
the bank. He believes that Brakken picked up the
long bone while he himself picked up the two
smaller ones, and after some general discussion they
threw them on the “waste pile.” Melvin Irwin’s
additional statement that the bone was in a definite
location and that there was a small streak of black
earth nearby seems valid as to position and hints at
a burial, but he also states that both the sand above
and the gravel below were solid and unbroken which
bespeaks entombment by natural causes. Earl
Tompkins and Teddy Randall testify that
on Tuesday, June 11, they were stripping
loam and caving the bank. Earl Tompkins
struck bones with his shovel at “second
spade depth,” that is, in the gravel after
the loam had been taken off. Both
Tompkins and Randall estimate the depth
of the bones at 16 to 18 inches.

PLATE 19.
Sketch map showing the location of the discovery,
and its surroundings.

The discrepancy as to date is not only
unimportant but characteristic of the
testimony of a group of men concerning
some event which they have witnessed.
The conflict in the testimony of Melvin
Irwin is probably due to the inability of
an untrained observer to value evidence
of unequal weight. It seems likely that his
testimony as to the position of the bone
is of value, whereas his testimony as to
the presence of black earth may be
unimportant because of the chance of
loam sifting over the face of the pit from
the soil above. The evidence of Tompkins
and Randall as to the depth at which they
struck bone does not conflict with that of
Melvin Irwin because they were talking
about different episodes in the sequence
of discovery.

Discovery of Sauk Valley Man of Minnesota
Geology of the Gravel Pit
As shown in Plate 20, the gravel pit lies on the
side of a flat-topped spur extending north to the
valley of Sauk River. The valley has a flat and
marshy floor, in which a quarter of a mile eastward
from the site lies the shallow body of water called
Lake Guerney. The spur is one of a series separated
by small valleys that are broad and gentle in their
upper reaches and narrow and sharp lower down.
One of these valleys and part of the ridge to the
west are shown in Plate 20. Both spurs are cut off
sharply in a steep, smooth slope or bluff that leads
down 70 feet to the flat and marshy floor of the
valley in which Sauk River runs from Lake Osakis
into Lake Guerney and through a chain of shallow
ponds to Sauk Lake. This steep bluff is gently
curved and looks like an old meander scar. The
north slope of the valley is more gentle and is
marked by a well- defined gravel terrace 25 to 30
feet high and thus definitely lower than the ridge in
which the pit lies.

59

Later forward movement caught up and destroyed
all but a small portion of the gravel.
The unconformity at the base of the West Union
gravel is distinct. The gravel is coarse and wellbedded, but lacks “open” texture. The limonite
cement is distinctive and is obviously due to
processes no longer in action. Under the loam, the
limonite is in the process of being leached and
calcium carbonate is being deposited.
General Geology of the Area

West Union Township is largely covered by till
of the “gray” type derived from the northwest or
Keewatin center. It lies east of the distinctive
Altamont-Gary morainic system in an area mapped
largely as ground moraine by Leverett2. He shows
one moraine trending northwest from the junction
of Ashley River and Silver Creek through the village
of West Union, and another trending east ward from
Lake Osakis along the valley of Sauk River to Lake
Guerney and eastward. These moraines are

Fitting these facts together, the

The valley of Sauk River is a much
larger feature. Apparently it begins at
Lake Osakis and continues eastward with
a chain of lakes to a main depression
extending from far to the north through
Long Prairie to Sauk Center. This
depression is shown by Leverett as filled
with gravel and even a short examination
shows that it is underlain by glacial
outwash with numerous small kettle holes
and major ice block depressions. This
north-south depression must have been

Discovery of Sauk Valley Man of Minnesota
Relative Age of the Till of the West Union Area
The relatively early deposition of the till near
West Union compared to the till of the AltamontGary moraines to the west is shown not only by the
extensive modification of the original glacial
topography but by the comparatively deep soil and
considerable weathering of the till. The top soil (“A”
horizon) is black or brown-black and generally 10
to 12 inches deep. The “B” horizon is a clayey mass,
brownish yellow in color, and from 2 to 3 feet thick.
The original character of the till has disappeared.
Limestone pebbles are absent. Only stones of
durable material such as quartz, quartzite and finegrained granite remain, except for a few boulders

of coarse granite which have obviously undergone
much decomposition. Calcium carbonate occurs in
little veins and soft, minute nodules. Below the “B”
horizon and merging with it lies the original till. It
is not wholly fresh but has a marked yellow color.
Basic igneous rocks and some of the limestone
pebbles are decomposed. Limonite occurs around
some of the pebbles and in seams. The imposition
of lime on a lower and earlier deposit of limonite is
even more marked in soils developed on gravel. It
has been noted already with regard to the West
Union gravel, but it is general in the gravel pits of
the locality.

Here, as in other parts of
southwestern Minnesota,
lime accumulation in the
subsoil seems to be normal
to the present climate. In
other words, these soils are
of the “pedocal” type and
indicate relative aridity. The
limonite accumulation,
which is now being
displaced, points to a time in
the past when the soils were
of the “pedalfer” type. This
relationship seems to indicate
a relatively recent change in
climate from a more humid
to a more arid type. The
severity of the recent drought
and the types of prairie
vegetation present in the
region indicate the kind of
aridity involved.

Ashley River and Silver Creek to the spillway is
not wholly clear, but apparently these valleys are
cut into the gravel of the spillway and must therefore
be much younger.
Unfortunately for the hypothesis that the West
Union gravel was deposited by a stream system
responsible in part for the erosional topography of
the local till plains, the gravel does not seem to be
widely distributed. Except for the ridge just west
of Fraser’s pit only one other outcrop has been
found. It is impossible to state dogmatically, on the
basis of these outcrops, that a distinct and separate
formation exists. In default of other outcrops, which
further investigation may reveal, another
explanation for this gravel must be sought. It is
possible that the West Union gravel is only locally
unconformable and that it is part of the till mass
like the underlying gray gravel. Under this second
hypothesis, the two known areas of outcrop would
become only parts of gravel masses included in the
extensive till mass. Following this viewpoint, which
however seems unlikely, the West Union gravel
would be of the same age as the till within which it
lies.

might be as old as the Iowan. The present trend is
to consider the Iowan as the first extension of the
Wisconsin ice, but even such relative antiquity
seems excessive. If the West Union gravel is so old,
it seems likely that the skeleton is younger than the
gravel, in fact, much younger. It must, in that case,
have been placed in the gravel as a burial long after
the deposition of the gravel and under such an
interpretation might be of no greater age than the
limonitic cement in the gravel.
The results of the investigation, here presented,
are disappointing because of the failure to obtain
conclusive evidence of the geologic age of the West
Union gravel. Nor are the circumstances of the
entombment of the skeleton in the gravel entirely
clarified. However, the skeleton by reason of the
depth of occurrence and the limonitic gravel in the
skull seems to have a considerable antiquity. It
should be considered as a possible representative
of one of the earlier races of Minnesota.

Relation of the Skeleton to the
West Union Gravel
The skeleton found in the West Union gravel
appears, on the face of the evidence, to be
contemporaneous with the gravel. If the gravel is
part of a stream deposit later than the underlying
till, such a relation is tenable. The race of men
represented by the skeleton would be no older than
others postulated as inhabitants of the region.

SAUK VALLEY SKELETON
BY A. E. JENKS

AND

The Skeletal Parts
The skeleton of the Sauk Valley man is in an
excellent state of preservation as regards bone
structure. Due to its having been dug out of the
gravel pit by laborers with no training in the art of
removing skeletal material, many of the bones were
broken and many of the smaller fragments as well
as many of the minor bones were overlooked and
lost.
The cranial vault was found whole, except that
parts of both zygomatic processes of the temporal
bones, and both pterygoid processes of the sphenoid
were missing. The upper portions of the nasal bones
and of the nasal process of the right maxilla are
attached to the nasal process of the frontal bone.
See Plate 22, No. 2. Three additional fragments of
the face are present. The first includes the right
malar bone complete and attached to the major
portion of the right maxilla. The latter lacks most
of the palatal process and the anterior portion of
the alveolar process, but the sockets for the third
and second molars are complete, and the lateral
portion of the sockets for the first molar, the
premolars and the cuspid are present, though none
of the teeth. The lower part of the nasal process of
this maxilla is part of the fragment and contacts the
upper part of the process which is attached to the
frontal, completing this process. Hence the lateral
margin of the nasal aperture is present.
The second facial fragment includes the
complete left malar to which is attached a part of
the left maxilla. The latter lacks the palatal and
alveolar process, and the nasal process is broken
off so that no contact is made with the frontal bone.
But the fragment does include the lateral margin of
the nasal aperture.
The third facial fragment is a nearly complete
mandible. Both rami are broken off in much the
same manner, the break beginning on the anterior
margin at a point a little below the level of the
bottom of the sigmoid notch and running obliquely

LLOYD A. WILFORD
downward and backward. (See Plate 22, No. 1).
The posterior margin of the right ramus is present
for 29 mm. from gonion, and of the left for 28 mm.
The second premolars are present, as are all of the
molars except the right third molar. All of the others
are missing except that the root of the right lateral
incisor is present in the socket.
The status of the bones of the skeleton other
than the skull is as follows:
A. Shoulder girdle.
1. Scapulae—both missing.
2. Clavicles—both are present, but each has
both ends broken off.
B. Trunk.
1. Vertebrae—two thoracic and one lumbar
vertebrae are present, all others missing.
2. Ribs—ten short portions of rib and four
rib fragments are present.
3. Sternum—missing
C. Pelvic girdle.
1. Innominate bones—a portion of each
innominate bone is present. The right lacks
the posterior portion of the iliac crest, the
lower part of the ischium and the pubis. The
left has a nearly complete ischium and the
pubis except for the pubic symphysis, but
lacks nearly all of the upper portion of the
ilium.
2. Sacrum—missing.
D. Upper extremities.
1. Humeri—both present and complete.
2. Radii—most of the left radius is present
with the distal end broken off. Only a small
portion of the distal end of the right is
present.
3. Ulnae—the proximal half of the left ulna is
present. Only a small portion of the right
shaft from near the proximal end is present.
4. Bones of wrists and hands—all missing.
E. Lower extremities.
1. Femora—both femora are present and
virtually complete.

running inward and upward to form a flattened apex
at the sagittal suture. In this aspect the mastoids
and the supra-mastoid crests are prominent
In norma lateralis the skull exhibits several
striking features. (See Plate 22, No. 1). The very
large malars, the large mandible and the high and
apparently prognathous maxilla give the appearance
of a face very large relative to the cranial vault.
The brow ridges and glabella are very prominent
and their forward projection is the more notable
since the frontal bone behind them has a fair angle
of slope. There is distinct lambdoid flattening. The
lower posterior contour is notable in that the
junction of the supreme nuchal lines lies high relative
to the Frankfort plane, the portion of the contour
below this junction being represented by a nearly
straight line at an angle of 141° to the Frankfort
plane. This line has a direction which is nearly at
right angles to the contour line of the flattened area
above lambda so that the area between lambda and
the supreme nuchal lines has a distinct rearward
projection. The skull is seen definitely as an occipital
type. The tuberculum linearum projects below inion
as a prominent triangular process.

The sutures are notable for their complexity. The
coronal suture below stephanion is simple, but

two measurements. He states that a wide difference
in these measurements is characteristic of such
groups as the Maori, Papuans, and Old Egyptians,
in contrast to the Swiss among whom the difference
between the two measurements is relatively small.
He adds that one of the factors affecting the
difference in the two height measurements is the
inclination of the plane of the foramen magnum.
The Sauk Valley skull is evidence of the truth of
the last statement, because in this skull the plane of
the foramen magnum is actually a positive angle of

considerably below the average for the Siouan and
Algonkin crania3 due to the low auricular height.

The maximum frontal diameter of 85 mm. is one
of the outstanding features of the skull. The lowest
racial mean listed by Martin4 is that of the diminutive
Vedda with 91 mm., the world average being about
95 mm. The fronto-parietal index of 61.1 is also
lower than any racial mean given by Martin,5 in spite
of the fact that this skull is dolichocephalic and that
all of the low racial means are found in

The maximum circumference of 503 mm. is
relatively low with reference to other racial groups,
and also with reference to the length and width
measurements. The narrow frontal and rather
pointed occiput are both factors in the low
measurement. The sagittal arc is 364 mm., a rather
low measurement, but quite in accord with those
of Indian groups generally. This arc is, however,
significant in the division of its three segments, for
while the frontal and parietal segments are about
equal, the occipital segment is much longer than
either.

much flattened by the wide suture. There is no postcoronoid depression. The bosses are above average
prominence for a male. Across the bosses the
parietal area is of average fullness but in its forward
part is of submedium width. (See Plate 23, No. 2).
There is only one foramen at obelion. This is at the
left of the sagittal suture and above average in size.
The index expressing the length of the inferior
margin relative to the length of the sagittal margin
is 85.5. This is a high and primitive index for a
dolichocephalic skull, though not so primitive as
the index of the Minnesota Man, which is 91.6.9

The predominance of the occipital segment is a
primitive trait in that in modern races this segment
is the shortest of the three, and in the gorilla and
orangutan skulls the occipital segment exceeds the
parietal. This predominance of the occipital segment
is found in the late glacial age Minnesota Man,7
though in a less marked degree than in the skull
under discussion. Martin’s table of racial means
shows that the occipital segment comprises from
31.1 per cent to 32.1 per cent of the sagittal arc in
all groups listed except the Eskimo 8 with a
percentage of 32.5. In contrast, the Minnesota Man
has a percentage of 34.3 and the Sauk Valley Man
35.4.

The Temporal Area: The temporal region is
notable for the pronounced supra-mastoid crest and
the large mastoids. The left mastoid has a clearly
marked external petro-squamous suture 32 mm. in
length. This suture is present on the right mastoid
but only for a short distance near the tip.

The transverse arc of the skull is low primarily
because of the low auricular height.
Specific Areas of the Cranial Vault
The Frontal: As already stated the brow ridges
and glabella are very pronounced, of the type
designated by Hooton as the modem torus type.
There is a deep nasion depression, with the
suggestion of a wide, tortuous metopic suture from
nasion to glabella. The forehead is narrow and low,
but the angle of slope, though more sloping than
normal, is not extreme. The bosses are subsubmedium in development and are overshadowed
by a sagittal crest which in the region of metopion
is broad and prominent. The very narrow, minimum
frontal diameter and the striking lateral extension
of the orbital border has already been discussed.
The Parietal: The forward part of the parietal
has a definite sagittal elevation, which is, however,

The length-breadth index of the squamous
portion is 60.0 indicating a long, narrow bone. Such
an index is primitive and below that of the
Minnesota Man, whose index is 61.5. Both of these
are considerably below the European average and
close to the Australian.
The Occipital Area: The curve of the occiput is
one of its most striking features and has already
been partially discussed. The low vaulted skull, with
its long occipital arc, lambdoid flattening and the
high angle of its lower posterior contour, presents
a projecting occiput, narrow and low. From
opisthion the mid-line of the skull runs backward
and upward in a nearly straight line to the junction
of the supreme curved lines. The angle made by
the chord between these points with the Frankfort
plane is 141°. The first major change of direction
occurs at the junction of the supreme lines. A second
major change of direction occurs at a point which
is 23 mm. above the junction of the supreme lines
and 30 mm. below lambda. The portion of the
sagittal line of the occiput between this point and
the junction of the supreme lines is nearly vertical.
(See Plate 22, No. 1). This portion represents the
extreme backward extension of the skull in the
Frankfort plane and also the height of the bun-like
projection.

From the point mentioned as that of the second
major change of direction, the contour turns
forward and upward to lambda. The chord
measurement from opisthion to the junction of the
supreme lines is 70 mm. and the arc length 73 mm.,
showing how closely this arc approaches a straight
line, and how very little the inferior and superior
nuchal lines affect the direction of the sagittal line
of the occiput. The observed high degree of
curvature of the occiput from opisthion to lambda
is affirmed in the chord index. The arc length is
129 mm., and the chord length 104 mm., with a
resulting index of curvature of 80.6. This low figure
represents a high degree of curvature as shown from
Martin’s racial table,10 in which the racial means of
this index range from 81.2 to 83.6. The angle of
141° made by the chord from opisthion to the
junction of the supreme lines with the Frankfort
plane, shows a definitely downward and backward
direction of the nuchal plane similar to that found
in Neanderthaloid skulls and that of Minnesota
Man.11

At inion, the union of the superior nuchal lines,
there is a prominent tuberculum linearum, a
triangular roughened process which extends
downward from inion for a distance of 12 mm. The
external occipital protuberance at the union of the
supreme lines has little elevation above the rest of
the torus and is defined only by the presence below
it, and above the inion point, of a roughened fossa.
This fossa clearly serves as one of the chief points
of attachment for the ligamentum nuchae of the
trapezius muscle. The external occipital crest is a
sharp ridge from opisthion to the inferior lines,
above which it is a prominent elevation for 11 mm.
to the tip of the prominent tuberculum linearum
described above.

The inion point lies 4 mm. below the Frankfort
plane, yet the inion-opisthion chord is 50 mm., a
long chord according to Martin’s table12 showing
racial means ranging from 36.3 to 45.7 mm. The
high measurement of the chord is probably due to
two factors; the lack of curvature between the inion
and opisthion, and the extension of the skull below

indicates that this skull belongs to the Mongoloid
group. The cranio-facial index of 103 shows the
face to be broader than the cranial vault and
accounts for the visibility of the zygomatic arch
when the skull is viewed in norma verticalis. This
last is an anthropoid characteristic, hence a primitive
feature. The zygo-frontal index expressing the
relationship between the facial width and the
minimum frontal breadth is important, for the

to be associated with shallow canine fossae and high
alveolar processes. This correlation is perfect in this
specimen for there is no canine fossa, the face being
very full, and the high alveolar process is probably
the principal factor in the great facial length. It is in
this respect that this skull differs most from the
Browns Valley skull, the latter having a deeply
curved infrazygomatic crest, a deep canine fossa
and low alveolar process which gives it a very low
face and facial index.
The Orbits: The orbits are wide and low and the
outward and downward slope is less than average.
The orbital indices, based on the lacrimale width
are right 81.7 and left 80.5, both very low indices,
particularly among the Mongoloids. The interorbital
breadth measured between the lacrimale points is
22 mm., a low measurement.16 The interorbital index
is also very low.17.
The Nose: Enough of the nasal or frontal
processes of the maxillae are present so that the
width of the nose can be fairly accurately determined
and a good estimate made of its length. The
measurement of the length is 58.0 mm., and of the
breadth is 27.0 mm. This is a long nose, correlated
with the long face. The index is 46.5, which is at
the upper range of leptorrhiny. Leptorrhine noses
are not common among modern Indians, but are
characteristic of the Eskimo and certain Indian
groups with marginal distribution along the Atlantic
and Pacific coasts. Both the Minnesota Man skull
and the Browns Valley skull have leptorrhine noses,
so that this condition, so far as Indians are
concerned, seems to be a trait of the earlier
population.
Only a short portion of the upper end of the nasal
bones is present The upper breadth of the nasalia is
11.6 mm. The bridge has a good average height, so
that again this skull is distinguished from Eskimo
crania with narrow flat nasalia. The high bridged
nose also distinguishes this skull and that of
American Indians generally from the flat noses of
the Mongols proper.

mandibles the Sauk Valley jaw is distinguished by
its size, especially in the great thickness of the body
and the extreme bigonial diameter. The body is long,
the measurement from the chin to the mid-point of
the line connecting the gonia being 87.0 mm. This
is in strong contrast to the wide, short Browns
Valley jaw, the body length of which is only 71.5
mm. The ramus angle of the jaw cannot be directly
measured, but observation of the stubs of the rami
indicates definitely that that angle is very low. A
reconstruction of the rami to fit the glenoid fossae
and place the jaw in proper position beneath the
two complete sockets for the right second and third
molars of the upper jaw gives an estimated condylosymphysial length of 111 mm., a bicondylar width
of 131 mm., and a ramus angle of 105° (the angle
measured on the basal plane). Indian and Eskimo
jaws tend to have lower ramus angles than Whites
and Negroids; hence have shorter condylosymphysial lengths relative to the body lengths. A
condylo-symphysial length of 111 mm. is seen from
Martin’s table18 to be relatively long; hence the
relative length of the body would be even greater.
Mongoloids characteristically have relatively wide
palates and mandibles correlated with great facial
breadth. The mandibular index of our specimen is
84.7. This is a low index, showing that though the
jaw is relatively long, its relative width is even
greater. Martin’s table18 shows that the Australian
exceeds other modern groups in both the condylosymphysial length and the bicondylar width of the
mandible with mean measurements of 112 mm. and
122 mm., respectively, but this table does not
include Eskimos nor Indians other than Peruvians.
Fourteen male mandibles from Minnesota mounds
have a mean condylo-symphysial length of 108.7
mm., a mean bicondylar width of 126.8 mm., and a
mean index of 85.7. Hence the Indian jaw is about
as large as the Australian jaw, exceeding the latter
in width about as much as the Australian jaw
exceeds it in length. Our specimen is seen to have
much the same mandibular index as the mounds
Indians, exceeding the latter in both dimensions.

Sauk Valley Skeleton
Browns Valley mandible was notable for its very
wide bigonial diameter of 118 mm., but the Sauk
Valley jaw exceeds that by 4 mm. Probably the
Eskimo and northern Indian jaws would exceed 103
mm. in their mean bigonial diameter. Nine mandibles
from Minnesota mounds have a mean bigonial
diameter of 107 mm., and Hrdlicka’s 8 male
Munsee20 have a mean diameter of 105 mm. A male
Eskimo loaned by the Peabody Museum at
Cambridge has a bigonial diameter of 115 mm. and
Oetteking21 lists one male Eskimo with a diameter
of 109 mm. The bigonial breadth relative to the 1
bicondylar breadth gives the very high index of 93.1.
The thickness of the body of the mandible is also
outstanding. Measured by Hrdlicka’s method22 the
body at the left second molar is 21.0 mm. thick.
Measured in the same way the cast of the Mauer
jaw has a thickness of 19.2 mm. Hrdlicka’s Munsee
males22 have a mean thickness of 15 mm., and range
from 13 mm. to 18 mm. At the chin and at the gonia
the body of the Lake Guerney jaw is much thicker
than that of the Mauer mandible. The symphysial
height of 34 mm. is also high. The body of the
mandible is thus seen as large in all dimensions, a
truly massive jaw.
The rami are relatively less robust than the
corpus. The estimated minimum breadth of the
ramus is 37.5 mm., with an index of 52.4, based on
an estimated ramus length of 71.5 mm. The width
measurement is above average, but the index is
lower than that of most modern primitive groups.

73

The index is considerably less than that of the
Minnesota Man and Eskimos generally, but is
notably higher than that of Browns Valley man.
The chin formation is modern. It is extremely
thick and heavy with a prominent external
projection. The genial tubercles are well developed
and there is a no genial pit or fossa.
The gonial region is also very thick and heavy.
Both gonia are very much thickened, especially on
the inside, and both internally and externally the
surface is strongly ridged. Powerful musculature is
suggested here.
The Teeth: As already noted, only 7 teeth were
found, all in the lower jaw. These are the two second
premolars and all the molars except the right third
molar. All are much worn so that the crown patterns
are nearly effaced. The teeth are large and notable
in the comparative lack of reduction of the second
and third molars. The following table of the mean
crown diameters of the lower molars of this
specimen compared with those of Browns Valley
Man, Minnesota Man and Dewey’s23 modern
average is instructive.
It is seen that the crowns of the Sauk Valley
molars are about equal in size to those of the
Browns Valley teeth, larger than Dewey’s means,
and smaller than those of Minnesota Man. Dewey’s
means show that though the mesio-distal diameters
of the crowns of all three lower molars have
undergone an absolute reduction, the second and

third molars have suffered a greater reduction than
the first. The Sauk Valley teeth do not exhibit the
latter condition since in the mesio-distal diameter
the second molar exceeds the first, while the third
molar equals the first. This relative lack of reduction
of the second and third molars is accepted as a
primitive characteristic.
The Long Bones
The Humerus: Both humeri of this skeleton are
complete and in almost perfect condition. The
measurements and indices of these follow:

Both humeri have strongly marked lines of
muscle attachment. The tuberosities are not large
but are rather angular, the lesser tuberosity being
especially sharply defined. From the latter tuberosity
a very prominent crest, the crista tuberculi minoris,
extends downward for about 60 mm., the crest
being more prominent and more sharply defined
on the left humerus than on the right. The bicipital
groove is deep and extends downward to the end
of the crista tuberculi minoris. The pectoral ridge
is prominent. On the right humerus, this ridge has a

shallow fossa along its medial side, which fossa is
strongly defined by a sharp crest along its medial
border. This fossa is very much less pronounced
on the left humerus. The deltoid eminence is very
prominent on both bones. That of the left for a
distance of 55 mm. upward from the mid-line of
the bone is a distinct crest, about 8 mm. wide and
sharply defined on each edge. “That of the right is
more extensive but less sharply defined. The spiromuscular groove is well defined on the left humerus,
but poorly defined on the right. Neither bone has a
supra-condyloid process. Neither septum is
perforated, the left being 2 mm. in thickness, and
the right 5 mm.
The greater angularity of the muscle ridges of
the left humerus is probably due to the fact that it is
a less robust bone, the right humerus exceeding it
in every measurement except length. The lengththickness index indicates bones of average
robusticity.
The most notable feature presented by the
measurements is the index of the diameters of the
head. The sagittal diameter is normally considerably
larger than the transverse diameter. Martin24 states
that the normal range of this index in man is from
90 to 95, but can vary from 88 to 98, giving an
elliptical shape to the head. In anthropoids the head
is nearly circular. In the gorilla and Homo
Neanderthalensis the transverse diameter exceeds
the sagittal, while in La Chapelle-aux-Saints the two
diameters are equal. The indices of the heads of the
humeri of this specimen, 100.7 and 97.4
respectively, are thus seen as primitive.
The indices of the mid-shaft show a pronounced
flattening or platybrachy. American Indians
characteristically have very low indices, but our
specimen is lower than the Indian average.
The Radius: As noted, the left radius is nearly
complete, though the distal end is missing. The right
radius is only a short fragment from the distal end,
but is greater than that portion of the left radius
that is missing. Hence a fairly accurate estimate can
be made of the left radius. Some measurements of
the left radius are as follows:

of the diameters at mid-shaft indicate a development
of the medial crest above average. The most
important feature is the high radio-humeral index,
a primitive index. The Negroid group as a whole
has a higher radio-humeral index than Mongoloids
and much higher than Whites, but many Indians—
notably the Munsee 25 — have high indices.
Minnesota Man also has a notably high index.26

The femur is of good average length with
robusticity a little above average, and with very
strong musculature markings. The linea pectinea is

The pilastric index is very high (very low by the
Hrdlicka method) because of the highly developed
pilaster. The index falls in with the means of those
primitive groups having the most highly developed
pilasters, such as some Indian groups, the Eskimo,
and some of the Negroid groups.
The index of platymeria is very low and in this
respect the bone belongs with those groups having
the greatest platymeria, the Polynesians and Indians.
A high degree of platymeria is in general a
Mongoloid trait.
The angle of torsion is interesting because of
the asymmetry of the right and left bones in this
respect.

Those characteristics of the skull which are
found in all Mongoloid groups are a high orbital
index, a high index of the upper alveolar arch,
shovel-shaped upper incisors, a high bi-zygomatic
diameter, a high zygo-frontal index, a low
interorbital index, a high alveolar process of the
maxilla, a shallow canine fossa, a shallow curve of
the inferior zygomatic crest, and a forward jut of
the malar bone. The index of the upper alveolar
arch and the shape of the upper incisors of our
specimen cannot be known. In the other respects
Mongoloid traits are exhibited except in the orbital
index. The low orbital index is in part due to the
pronounced brow ridges.

primitive in varying gradations. This is true of the
American aborigines so in comparing the Sauk
Valley skeleton with the modern Indians it must be
borne in mind that the latter are ranked as primitive
and that certain individuals may and do exhibit more
primitive traits than the group as a whole. The list
of primitive characteristics of Sauk Valley Man,
however, is so impressive that it seems more logical
to conclude that the specimen is separated from
the modern Indian by a considerable time interval
than to believe that it represents a highly aberrant
member of a modern group.
Minnesota is fortunate in having two skeletons
that on geological and archaeological grounds are
known to be older than the recent Indian remains
from the area. They therefore offer an excellent
opportunity of comparing our subject with early
material from the same locality.
A Comparison of the Sauk Valley Skeleton with
the Minnesota Man and Browns Valley Skeletons
A comparison of this specimen with Minnesota
Man shows many similarities, bearing in mind that
the former is an adolescent female and the latter is
an adult male. Many of the primitive characteristics
of the former are found in the latter, yet each has
some features definitely primitive that are less
primitive or not at all primitive in the other.
The auricular height of the male is low, that of
the female is higher though below average, so that
the latter has a good cranial capacity, the former a
relatively lower capacity.
Both skulls are house-shaped in norma
occipitalis, and both are occipital types, the male
having the more projecting and bun-shaped occiput.
In both, particularly the male, the occipital segment
of the sagittal arc is very long relative to the parietal
segment, and in both this condition is correlated
with a long temporal squama and a long squamous
margin of the parietal bone. The male, however,
lacks the upward thrusting mastoid plate of the
female.

In general skeletal features are rated as primitive
according to the degree that they vary from the
condition found in normal skeletons of the highly
civilized modern Europeans. The latter are thus
taken as the standard of comparison, and as

occiput, the female is far more primitive. The wide,
flattened occipital torus of the male is not unlike
that of several, more modern Indian crania, but the
female occiput with its poorly defined superior
curved lines, its transverse bar of bone or external
occipital protuberance at the union of the supreme
curved lines, and its U-shaped grooves is unique.
The foramen magnum of the male is the more

low, is well within the range of modern means.

nasal sill. These features are not present for
observation on the male skull.
In the lengths of the arm and leg bones, relative
to stature it was noted that the sequence was exactly
the same in both skeletons-radius, tibia, femur and
humerus. Hence both have high radio-humeral and
tibio-femoral indices. The index of the diameters
of the head of the humerus is high in both skeletons,
but higher and more primitive in the male.
From this comparison it must be concluded that
the Sauk Valley skeleton exhibits a lesser degree of
primitiveness than the Minnesota Man.

It is seen that the two skulls have much in
common. Many of these common traits such as the
occipital torus, high supreme nuchal lines, and broad
faces are shared by other rugged male skulls from
the area. The prominent brow ridges and broad
jaws, common to both, are approached by other
rugged males. Of the two skulls, the Sauk Valley
has the most primitive features and must be classed
as the more primitive. But the Browns Valley skull
with its short face and long head, reminiscent of
the Late Paleolithic period of Europe, is
distinguished from the long faced Indian population,
whereas the Sauk Valley Man is like the more recent
Indian in this respect.

Browns Valley skeleton is dated culturally by its
association with a type of chipped implement, which
also occurs in the lowest level of the Signal Butte
site and tentatively is dated by Strong as from 7,000
to 10,000 years old.27 Geologically the Browns
Valley skeleton is dated as not older than the Tintah
Beach of Glacial Lake Agassiz, which is placed at
about 12,000 years old. Thus we have two
skeletons, the more primitive of which, the
Minnesota Man, is dated as 20,000 to 25,000 years
old, and the less primitive of which, the Browns
Valley skeleton, is dated as 8,000 to 12,000 years
old. On the basis of primitive characteristics, the

SKELETAL REMAINS FROM NORTHERN TEXAS
BY ALES HRDLICKA
The material to be briefly reported on in this paper has been partly donated to the U. S. National
Museum, partly submitted to me for examination, by Dr. Cyrus N. Ray, of Abilene, northern Texas. It
proceeds from several mounds and sites in this general region. It is regrettably quite meager, but even
thus it is of exceptional interest in more than one particular. It consists of but 3 male adult skulls, with a
series of humeri, femora and tibiae, but the characteristics of these are such as to be well worth recording.
One of the skulls, damaged, from Roberts Mound (1) S (2)1 had already been pictured by Ray2 and
reported on by Hooton,3 but it has now been carefully reconstructed and shows slightly differing
measurements; the other two specimens and the long bones are here reported upon for the first time.
The Crania
The main interest in these specimens is their pronounced dolichocephaly, especially in the Roberts
mound ( 1 ) S (2) . This skull is the one that has already been reported upon by Hooton, but examined
and measured by him in a somewhat defective repair. Since coming to the National Museum this specimen
has been carefully reconstructed and gives the measurements shown below. It is a normal undeformed
male skull, from an individual of good but not heavy muscularity, quite plainly Indian, and resembling
closely, on one hand, the more markedly narrow skulls from Coahuila,4 Lower California,5 southeastern
Utah, and from other parts of Texas;6 and on the other hand a good many of those of the eastern
Algonkins. It is a type which is also met, with modifications, among a large strain of the more northern
and the northeastern Eskimo. It is not an ancient type, for it has never been encountered in early man; it
appears to be a late land especially American differentiation, though its roots lie doubtless \Somewhere
in northeastern Asia. It is somewhat akin to the Nordic type of skull of Europe.
Detailed description of the specimen is not called for on this occasion—that found in Professor
Hooton’s article, if the superlatives be left out, will suffice with two or three small modifications or
additions. These relate to massiveness of the skull-this is throughout slightly submedium for an Indian.
The supraorbital ridges-these are somewhat ,above the Indian medium in development but otherwise
subdivided at middle as usual in modern skulls and limited to the medium two thirds of the supraorbital
space on each side; but the whole subfrontal region above the orbits is somewhat shelving forward. The
temporal regions are actually perceptibly depressed or concave from above downward. The nature of
the upper incisors, as to shovel-shaped character, cannot be decided, the teeth are worn off too much.
And the chin portion of the lower jaw is quite as prominent as it is in an average White of today. The
satisfactory present state of the specimen makes all this quite plain.

This, like the Roberts Mound specimen, is a normal skull of an adult male. It is less narrow, has
somewhat less developed supraorbital ridges, better arched front, lower orbits, broader nasal aperture,
broader face and palate, less marked occipital crest, and an absence of the subparietal concavity. Also
the bones are somewhat thicker. The outline of the norma superior is a long ellipse. There are marked
subnasal fossae, medium nasal spine, somewhat above medium alveolar protrusion. Teeth partly worn,
normal, bicuspids and canines somewhat above medium in stoutness, incisors missing. Basion and condyle
region elevated. Glenoid fossae deep, styloids submedium, high prestyloid process or sheath each side.
No lower jaw.
In shape of vault the skull duplicates some Algonkin crania, in facial features it approaches more the

Comments on Crania
While there are only three specimens at hand and not one perfect, yet there is enough for strong
indications as to the nature of the skulls. It would be superfluous to go into any long discussion on this
point. The skulls are unquestionably Indian, and were it not for their locality they could only be diagnosed
as Algonkin.
These conclusions were reached independently, but I find that Professor Hooton has come to similar
deduction on his series. He says,9 “There can be no question that these crania represent a Neanthropic or
morphologically modern type of man. . . . to the present writer the Texas skulls recall more clearly some
of the Eastern dolichocephalic Indians.” Dr. Hooton believes to see in the facial parts of the skulls also
some mongoloid inclination, but this is more or less common in all American aborigines.
Additional Skeletal Parts
The Humerus: There are but 11 male and 1 female humeri. The bones in general are long and quite
straight, but not very massive.
Only two among the 9 male bones that can be examined for the feature, and the 1 female, show septal
apperture and this in one is but pin-point, in two small.
The shape of the shaft at middle differs; it is prismatic in one, plano-convex in one (the female), with
nearly so in two, more or less quadrilateral (anterior border broadened into a distinct surface) in 6, and
intermediary in two. For an American group there is nothing distinctive in this showing.
The length and strength of the bones is shown in the next table:

In length these Texas humeri are equalled, in aboriginal North America, only by those of the tall
Algonkins. In absolute strength they are close to the general North American Indian average, being
surpassed slightly in a number of the tribes and surpassing in turn slightly others. Relatively to their
length they also approach the general average (module-length index in 17 groups of North American
Indian males, 62.3). So far as the length and strength of the arms were concerned therefore there is
nothing exceptional in this series.
The Midshaft Index: The shaft at middle gives two easily measurable dimensions, the minimum or
antero-posterior, and the major or lateral diameter;10 and the percental relation of the former to the latter
is the humeral midshaft index, which has racial value. In 1930 humeri of male American Whites (in
general), measured by me, this index averaged 83._, in 112 male American Negro 84.1, in 448 Indians of
various tribes 73.3. In the Texas humeri the index ranges thus:

There is a considerable uniformity in the measurements, hut for some reason the hones from the
Myatt place are appreciably stouter and give higher indices than the rest. If we take only the seven
humeri from the Alexander, Matthews and Roberts mounds, the determinations are typically Indian:

THE FEMUR
General Descriptive Characters
There are 14 male and 5 female femora, representing 9 male and 3 female skeletons, derived
from 8 localities in the Abilene region.
The femora are free from disease or malformations. The general impression they convey is that of
long but only moderately strong bones. Taking them by the sexes there are the following notes:

Female ---------- 2

The bones differ much, it is seen, in this respect, but in 11 out of the total of 19 the curvature is but
moderate or medium.
Pilastry: Three of the male bones—all with marked curvature—show very high, doubtless
compensatory, crista aspera. But pilastry in the male bones of this series appears to be generally above
the medium.
Gluteal Tuberosity (3rd Trochanter). This tuberosity is rather common in these femora in the males,
but is curiously-doubtless accidentally-absent in the bones of the three females.
In the male femora the records show as follows:

A similarly high occurrence of the feature was found by me in mound femora from Louisiana; 11, 12
Costa found 3rd trochanter in 64% of 14 Indian (tribe?) and in 94.5% of the 37 Fuegian femora he
examined. In the North American Indians at large a distinct gluteal tuberosity, all sizes, was found in
29.91 % of the male bones.12 In only one other small series, from other parts of the world, namely that
of 16 femora of Canary Islanders examined by Houzé,12 is recorded an approaching frequency (56.2 %)
of the feature.

Measurements
The Abilene region Texas femora are decidedly long. There are fit for measurements 14 male and 5
female adult bones, proceeding from respectively 7 and 3 skeletons. The average bicondylar length of
the 12 male bones where the measurement is possible is 46.41 cm., of the 4 female bones 41.95 cm. The
male bones are longer than are those of the general American Whites (45.06 cm.) 13 and correspond
approximately to a stature of 175 cm., or that of the tallest of our Indian tribes, such as the Sioux or the
Maricopa.14 In detail the measurements were as follows:

There is, it is seen, some variability in the dimensions, but the general tendency is to long bones and
hence tall stature.
The differences between the two lengths differ but all fall within the usual in Indian femora-on the
whole therefore the bones are neither markedly more oblique nor straighter.
Proportions at Middle of the Shaft
Strength: The robustness of the femur is best determined by the mean diameter of the shaft at the
middle of the bone, and especially by the relation of this mean diameter, or midshaft module, to the
length of the bone, thus:

Other Parts of the Femur
In dimensions the remaining parts of the Texas femora, i. e., the extremities of the bone, show
nothing uncommon.

Skeletal Remains From Northern Texas

Shape of the Shaft
By the shape of the shaft of the femur is meant the outline of the shaft in its cross section, at the
middle of the bone.16 In 1802 male adult North American Indians at large, the shapes were, cylindrical
7.7, elliptic 10._, plano-convex 5.6, and prismatic 23.6 per cent, the remaining (53%) being less well
defined or intermediates; the females showing less of the cylindrical and plano-convex, more of the
elliptic and about the same proportion of the prismatic shafts. Of the 14 male Texas femora dealt with
here 4 or 28.6% were cylindrical, 7 or 50% near-cylindrical, 1 or 7.1 % plano-convex, another 1 near
plano-convex, and 1 near prismatic. Among the 5 female bones none were cylindrical, 1 was prismatic
and 1 nearly so, 1 near elliptic, 1 near plano-convex, and 1 indeterminate. The cylindrical shaft therefore,
in this series, shows a much higher frequency than it does in the North American Indians at large, while
in the few female bones it is absent. None of the tribes represented in our general Indian series gave such
a frequency of the cylindrical form, though this rose in the bones from pre-White Tennessee to 11.6%
and in those from old burials in Virginia to 15.9%. In no race available for comparison (Eskimo, Whites,
Negroes, Old Egyptians) did the proportion of this type, in the adult bones, reach these figures. But the
cylindrical type of the shaft, and the elliptic, are the two principal types found in the femora of the
young.17 The feature in the Texas male bones may therefore much more properly be regarded as juvenilism
than any racial peculiarity. It represents a lack of differentiation, which must have been connected with
the work habits of these males.
A further light on the shape of the shaft is obtained from the two diameters taken at its middle18 and
from the midshaft index obtained from the two. These diameters and index in our femora are as follows:

The above averages indicate a high pilastry, due to exceptional elevation of the crista aspera. In this
respect the femora of the Texas males stand at the head of available American series, being closely
approached only by the S. E: Utah “basket-makers.” This will be appreciated from the next table. The
females, curiously, barring one individual (Roberts mound) are not exceptional in this respect, which
gives a strong indication that the peculiarity in the males is less inherent than acquired, that is, ontogenetic,
functional. Such a development in the males, while the females remain unaffected, could possibly be
brought about through exceptionally developed and common running habits-it would be difficult to
suggest other factors.

Subtrochanteric Flattening
This flattening, or platymery, has been discussed recently in my report on “The Femur of the Old
Peruvians” (Am. J. Phys. Anthrop., 1938, XXIII, No. 4), and is a feature which always deserves attention.
It is partly of racial, partly of functional significance. It differs among the American Indians more or less
from tribe to tribe, with a general inclination to a more pronounced form than in the Whites or the
Negro. The records obtained from the Texas femora and their comparison are given in the following two
tables.

Both the measurements and the indices of the Texas femora are close to the average of the North
American Indians in general. They are slightly flatter, but this is equalled and exceeded in good many of
the Indian groups. The relatively low platymeric index is one of the outstanding characteristics of the
American aborigines. It goes a long way toward the identification of the Texas remains as those of
Indians.
Tibiae
There are 14 measurable tibiae of adult males, 4 of adult females. As with the rest of the long
bones the material is small, yet of interest.
Descriptive Features: The first striking character of these bones is their universal straightness. Only 2
of the 18 bones could be recorded as ‘near straight’, 16 were ‘straight’ to ‘very straight’. In this respect
these tibiae resemble those of the Negro, but they are very different from these in almost every other
respect, resembling most on the whole the tibiae of other Indians.
Shape: A second striking feature of most of these bones is the pronounced development of the posterior
vertical ridge, the formation through that from the ordinary single posterior surface, of two, postero-

lateral and postero-mesial, surfaces, and a marked accentuation through the same .agency of the anteroposterior diameter and, secondarily, of the flatness of the shaft. Tibiae of this sort occur elsewhere
among the Indians, and also among the Eskimo, but they are seldom as pronounced and not so frequent.
Here again it would be most desirable to know the habits of the tribe or tribes from which the bones are
derived, for the development of the striking modification of the posterior surface of the hones could only
have been conditioned by powerful and long-lasting special demands on the leg musculature. The tendency
toward the same form also, in the females suggests that the same has already become generalized in the
group hereditarily, but the much more pronounced degree of the peculiarity in the male tibiae indicates
that the causes producing it were especially and continuously active in that sex. All this suggests once
more the idea of extraordinary exercise of the men as runners—there appears in fact no other plausible
explanation.
The individual records in this connection are very illustrative:

The percentage of type 4 rises, it is seen, to 75 per cent of the tibiae in each sex, though, as mentioned,
the character is much more accentuated in the males than in the females. No Indian tribe, and much less
any other known human group, approaches such a condition. But that cannot be taken for an indication
that the Abilene region aborigines may have belonged to a racial group different from the Indian. The
feature in question can only be regarded as essentially functional or ontogenic and not racial. There may
have taken place here also some sort of selection-but this is speculation.
Additional: The extremities of these tibiae offer nothing special.
Measurements
The most useful measurements of the tibia are its length and its two diameters at middle. I take
commonly two lengths, the standard bicondylar and the maximum, mainly for a check on each other. The
mean of the two diameters at middle in relation to the bicondylar length of the bone, gives the index of
strength of the shaft; and the percental relation of the bicondylar length of the tibia to the bicondylar
length of the femur gives the tibio-femoral index, of value in racial identification. The measurements of
the Texas tibiae follow:

The tibiae, it is seen, are long, and the differences between the bicondylar and the maximum length
are small. The important tibio-femoral index averages in the males around 84, which is higher than in
Whites (White tibia relatively shorter), slightly lower than in the Negro (negro tibia relatively slightly
longer), but just about the same as in other North American Indians where the means for different
groups vary from roughly 83 to 85.
Strength: As with the femur, the best way to bring out the strength of the tibia is through the module:
length index, or the percental relation between the mean diameter of the shaft at middle and the bicondylar
length of the bone. The measurement and index in the Texas bones are as follows:

In various groups of North American Indians, in the males, the averages of the module or mean
diameter of the tibia at its middle range from 2.53 to 2.90,19 the general average being near 2.75. In the
14 Texas male tibiae it is exactly 2.75 cm. This crude measurement is however of little value without
contrasting it with the length of the bone. When this is done with the bones of different Indian groups the
resulting average proportion or index ranges in the males around 72, in the females around 68. In the
Texas series in 9 male bones it averages 69.16, which shows that these tibiae, like the corresponding
femora, are relatively somewhat slender. In all probability the people from whom these bones proceed
were in general of a tall stature but rather slender. This would agree with an anticipated build in great
runners.
The Index of Flatness (Platycnaemy) at Middle: The percental relation of the lateral with the anteroposterior diameter at midshaft in the tibia averages in the North American male Indians roughly from 62
to 70, the general mean being around 66. In the Texas bones the measurements and indices offer much
of interest:

*With anterior border of the bone midway between the two branches of the calipers.
The mean midshaft index of the Abilene region tibiae is the lowest on our records. The individual
bones in this respect are equalled occasionally among other Indians, but the general average, i. e., such
a prevalence of the low indices, is not; nor is it found outside of America. The fact is due to the frequency
in these Texas bones of the 4th border and its extraordinary development. It is a highly interesting
regional phenomenon. It does not, again, indicate a different race of people, but rather an Indian group
with some especially developed and persevering habits from which but a few individuals escaped. That
some did escape is seen from the bones of No. (2) of the Myatt site, and also somewhat by No. (3) from
that site, -;’S well as by the male tibia’ from the Alexander mound and the two tibiae of a female from the
Roberts’ mound.
Concluding Remarks
These may be very brief. The material here reported upon proved as already mentioned of especial
interest; this however not through its taxonomy, but through the secondary developments, of evidently
functional origin, shown by the long bones of the lower limbs of the skeletons.
The crania and the basic characteristics of the long bones show on the whole definitely that these
belonged to Indians, of tall stature, and of Algonkin-like type. The secondary modifications are limited,
as already said, to the bones of the lower limbs. Evidently it was only those habits which affected the
musculature and bones of the lower limbs that were peculiar in this group. This points strongly to a
greatly developed habit of running or walking.

THE CLEAR FORK CULTURE COMPLEX
BY CYRUS N. RAY
Its Relation to Other Cultures

Difficulties of Finding Chronological Order

Prior to the year 1927, when the writer began
his research, an area in Central Texas larger than
that of some states still remained g blank on the
archeological maps. Almost no scientific
archeological research had been done in a region
nearly three hundred miles long from east to west,
and over one hundred and fifty miles wide from
north to south.

In the forty or fifty thousand years in which it is
probable that man has occupied this region5 there
has been ample time for erosion and accretion, to
act and counteract, to shuffle and to mix and
disarrange the records 60 often that it becomes
difficult to separate the mixtures which have
resulted.

It is within this territory that the remains of that
peculiar dolichocephalic human type known as
Abilene Man were first found and described by this
writer.1 It was also within the same area that he
first found and described the most deeply buried
ancient midden levels yet found in America, in which
he also first found, named and described the crude
thick leaf-shaped Abilene Points. The area bears
every physical evidence of having been lived upon
by man throughout a great many millenniums of
time.2
Great Depth of Midden Strata
The great depth of the superimposed geological
deposits in which one may find crude flint tools
embedded3 the thickness of the patination on many
flint implements, the primitive types of human
skeletal materials found,4 the depth at which some
human crania are stratified, and the bones of extinct
animals found embedded with flint artifacts, all
testify to the ancientness of the human occupation
levels of the Abilene region.
Many Flint Culture Types
Throughout the years many distinct types and
cultures of flint tools have been first found here
and described by the writer. At the present time
enough data has not been collected to enable one
to separate the great diversity of Central Texas flints
into a complete and ordered chronological series.

However despite all of the difficulties there are
certain types of artifacts which have been found
here and there alone, and in pure culture, in other
places the same kinds have been let down on old
eroded clay soil surfaces together with mixtures of
ancient implements.
Occasionally certain types are found embedded
on the exposed edges of deep strata, and one can
then pick a typical implement out of its
chronological layer, much as a boy picks raisins out
of a cake. Again in a few fortunate instances blades
have been found by digging back into the edges of
these deeply buried strata.
Lived in Mountain Valley Sites
One of the most difficult flint culture complexes
to be fitted into the chronology of the river bank
stratification has been the Clear Fork Culture
Complex. While its gouges were first found on the
very high terraces of The Clear Fork of the Brazos
and the Culture takes its name from that first
description,6 this flint culture appears to have been
invented by a type of man who usually lived in
narrow mountain valleys, either near to springs or
on what are now dry creek branches located several
miles below what are at present weakly flowing
springs. It is probable that the period of occupation
was so long ago that streams then flowed from the
springs down past the old camp sites. In some
instances there is not now any evidence that a spring
ever was near except that the site could not have
been occupied unless water once was there.

98

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

The location of the sites makes it very difficult
to correlate these deposits with the stratified
superimposed river valley bank strata of the same
region.
However the Clear Fork Culture tools erode
from several feet below the surface even in old
mountain side campsite deposits and from gravel
terrace deposits along dry branches of creeks. In
one such site Folsom and Folsomoid flint dart heads
are found on the same old much eroded surfaces.7
In this site a Folsomoid point three inches long was
found July 4, 1938, in the same water borne deposit
at the same level and almost against the two teeth
and bones of a mammoth (Elephas Columbi).8
Clear Fork Implements Resemble
Paleolithic Types
Several nationally known students of European
paleolithic implements have stated to the writer that
The Clear Fork Culture contains more of the typical
European paleolithic forms of artifacts than any
other previously found in America, and that if these
had been found in Europe they would
unquestionably be considered to be of great age.
The handaxes, spokeshaves, burins, and grattoirs,
have especially been selected by these authorities
as representing European paleolithic types.
Clear Fork Culture Flint Gouges
One of the most distinctive tools of this Culture
is of a peculiar type perhaps best described as a
gouge, although its real use is unknown. Within a
short time after the writer initiated the research in
the Abilene region he began to find these unusual
tools on the high terraces above the Brazos River,
and first described and illustrated them in this
Bulletin in Vol. 1, 1929, and named and partially
described The Clear Fork Culture Complex in
1934.9
The Clear Fork gouges are usually made of flint
but occasionally of quartzite. The size varies
considerably in different sites. The smallest
specimen in the writer’s collection is l ½ inches wide
at the widest end and is two inches long. The largest
is 2 ½ inches wide at the larger end and 5 1/8 inches

long. These implements were made by taking out
large flakes by the percussion method which gave
the blades a sinuous edge. The blades are quite
thick, especially at the larger ends, and not very
sharp pointed. One face is convex and is longer
than the other. The other and shorter face is nearly
flat. The larger thick ends of these tools are scooped
out between the ends of the short faces and the
ends of the long faces, in such manner as to leave
curved cutting edges at the ends of the longer
convex faces. One of these gouges was found by
the writer where it probably had eroded from the
surface of a gravel deposit a few feet distant from
where three elephas bones lay embedded in the same
gravel.
Clear Fork Planer-Gouges
Found in the same sites are implements of very
similar type; these have the longest face made by
one flat surface instead of the convex much chipped
surface of the longest face of the gouges. The thick
ends of these implements are either scooped out
like those of the gouges or less often are beveled
down to an edge like a carpenter’s plane. However
the construction is not at all similar to that of any
of the ordinary flint end scrapers of the region.
Both the gouges and the planer-gouges may have
been used for the same purposes but their different
construction would suggest a different use.
The writer suggests that the gouge’s curved
cutting edges may have been used in gouging out
hard substances, such as wood and bone, and the
gouge-planers in planning the surfaces down. The
writer has found a total of 250 gouges and planergouges in the Abilene region. These are about
equally divided between the two types.
Clear Fork Culture Dart (1)
There are four distinctly different kinds of dart
heads found with the other components of The Clear
Fork Culture Complex. The writer believes that this
flint Culture was used throughout such a long period
of time that the dart head types went through several
evolutionary changes into at least four distinct kinds
during the time when the other main components

The Clear Fork Culture Complex
such as gouges, planer-gouges, burins, side scrapers
and paleolithic type hand axes were still being used.
He also believes that the time of use of The Clear
Fork Culture Complex was very near to, if not
during, the same period when Folsom and Yuma
points were being used. Just what the relative age
of the four types is has not yet been determined.
However Nos. (1) and (2) were found in pure
culture in the same sites. The Clear Fork Dart (1)
is usually about three inches long, 7-8 of an inch
wide, and 3-8 of an inch thick. The dart head has a
long oval round ended base, without either
shoulders or barbs. Its width is about the same
throughout. It is relatively long, narrow and thick.
Its percussion fractured blades are twisted
lengthwise similar to the propeller of an airplane. A
dart of this type is not beveled but its whole blade
is twisted from the haft to the point. Most of these
points are heavily patinated.

99

Clear Fork Dart (2)
The Clear Fork Dart (2) has two subtypes, one
long and not so wide, and one short and oval
shaped. Darts of the shorter type sometimes have
blades which are twisted, but not so much so as
those of Dart (1). The most constant feature of Dart
(2) is that the stems of the bases are always beveled
to the right. These points have neither barbs nor
shoulders, and are rather thick. The short broad
oval type vary from 2 to nearly 3 inches long, and
from 1 to 1 3-16 inches wide. The oval type is
shaped abruptly to a sharp point while the long
relatively narrow type is shaped more gradually to
a point. The longest one of the narrow type is 4 ½
inches in length and 15-16 of an inch in width.
Clear Fork Dart (3)
This triangular point is larger, longer and thicker
than Dart (4). Its base is straight and square and
only occasionally slightly recessed, and its edges

are straight near the base instead of flared. It also
has long slender flakes chipped out of the center,
up from the base. It is finely retouched all along its
edges to the point, and usually is somewhat serrated.
These points vary from about 1 3-4 to 2 1-2 inches
in length, and from 1 1-8 to 1 3-8 inches in width.
Nearly all of such points are very deeply patinated.
Clear Fork Dart (4)
The Clear Fork Dart (4) is of a broad triangular
shape and is thinned up from the center of the base.
It has the form of outline of an old type of Chinese
hat. The bottoms of the edges near the base flare
outward and upward. The center of the base of one
of these points is slightly recessed and from this
recess several long narrow flake channels extend
upward toward the point. Like the Folsom points
the outer edges of these points are thicker than the

centers, but they lack the minute retouch along the
margins, and the shape is entirely different.
Some of these points are beveled to the right,
and some serrated, and nearly all are deeply
patinated. These points vary from 1 1.2 to 2 inches
in length, and from 1 3-8 to 1 5-8 inches in width at
the base, which is the widest part.
Clear Fork Gravers or Burins
Clear Fork gravers are roughly fractured thick
flint flakes on which short, strong, beak shaped,
graver points have been carefully chipped.
According to authorities on European graver points
or burins such points greatly resemble the paleolithic
types found there. It is quite likely that these strong
sharp points were made for the purpose of
engraving hard substances such as shell, bone, horn,

and stone. Three engraved bone tubes made from
the lee bones of some uncommonly large bird were
found around the neck of a woman of the Abilene
Man type.10 There are several different types of
gravers. While most flakes include only one graver
point, some have two to three or more points.
However those of definite beaked form usually only
have one point. There are sixty Clear Fork gravers
in the writer’s collection. All of these gravers are
deeply patinated.
Clear Fork Spokeshaves
Clear Fork Spokeshaves are thick flint flakes in
which semi-lunar sharp cutting edges have been
carefully chipped. Usually only one cutting edge
was made in a flake, but some have two cutting
edges. The cutting edges vary considerably in size.
These probably were made in different sizes suitable
for rounding off different sized dart, and spear
shafts, and ax handles. There are forty-four
specimens of spokeshaves in the writer’s collection.

101

Clear Fork Coup de Poings or Hand Axes
There are several distinct types of these hand
axes but all have a general resemblance, due first
to the fact that a similar technique in flint chipping
(percussion) was used in making them, and second,
that they were all made to be grasped in the hand
without the use of a handle.
They resemble several ancient types of European
paleolithic hand axes too closely to be differentiated
from, them if one did not know the place of origin
of either.
Such axes were made by selecting a natural flint
pebble large enough so that one end could be
grasped in the hand and by percussion flaking off
an edge on the other. By this method the original
crust was left intact on all but the cutting edge.
The large flakes produced a characteristic sinuous
edged blade. There are a good many subtypes of
this ax. Only the two most numerous types will be
described fully.

In one type the edge was made by chipping off
from both faces toward the center which made the

The broad axes have cutting edges from 4 to 5
inches broad and are from 4 1-2 to 6 1-2 inches in
length. This ax is very much broader at the bottom
or cutting edge than at the top. Some of these axes
have only one row of large flakes taken off of the
bottom or cutting edge. Other axes are chipped for
from one-half to two-thirds of the distance up the
blades. All of both types have an ancient thick patina

has suggested their use as hammerstones. A few
large specimens do show a little bruising on the
edges but most do not. Some were too small for
such use.
Aside from these reasons to doubt such use, the
typical round flint ball hammerstone, which stems
back into early paleolithic times, is just as commonly
found in Clear Fork Culture Sites as in those of the
late Indians. There are 55 of these disks displayed
in the writer’s exhibit in The West Texas Chamber
of Commerce Museum in Abilene.

In Conclusion

Bibliography

The reader naturally infers correctly from the
above statements that the writer believes that The
Clear Fork Culture was one of the flint cultures
which were used by dolichocephalic Abilene Man
at some period of the vast lapse of time in which he
undoubtedly occupied the Abilene section of Central
Texas. The idea also occurs that this also may have
been the type of man who fashioned Folsom and
Yuma Points, the writer believes that it was, and
that the Folsom Culture is no older, if indeed so
old, as The Clear Fork Culture. However both may
have been contemporaneous. It will require much
more research to determine their relative places in
the chronology. In the case of the Abilene Points
the writer’s present belief is that these are far older
than either the flints of the Folsom, Yuma, or Clear
Fork Complexes.

1929, p.p. 430-431.

While there is some evidence, as cited above,
that Clear Fork Man’s tools were used by Abilene
Man, there has been no instance in the writer’s
excavation of over fifty Abilene Man burials, where
a gouge, planer-gouge, graver, spokeshave, or a
hand ax have been found with a burial. Evidently
Abilene Man had very little of the later Indian’s
conception of a hereafter, because of the fact that
he usually buried nothing whatever with the bodies.
In the few instances where he did, nearly all of the
artifacts were of bone or shell. This condition may
also explain why Folsom Points have not yet been
definitely identified with a human type.

BLUE MOUNTAIN ROCK SHELTER
BY W. C. HOLDEN

Blue Mountain Rock Shelter is located in the
east side of Winkler County about fourteen miles
northeast of Kermit and approximately forty-two
miles northwest of Odessa. Blue Mountain is really
not a mountain at all, but is the southern escarpment
of the Llano Estacado. Approaching the escarpment
from the north, one travels over a nearly level plain
and comes suddenly and unexpectedly to the
Caprock. It is only when the escarpment is seen
from the south that it has the appearance of a long,
flat mountain, hence the misleading name, Blue
Mountain.

spring had a strong and constant flow. They are of
the opinion that the lowering of the underground
water table on the Llano Estacado has had
something to do with the spring’s ceasing to flow
during recent years. At the time the adjacent rock
shelter was occupied, the spring was no doubt a
well known watering place.

Our attention was first called to Blue Mountain
Shelter by M. R. Henderson Shuffler of Odessa.
Mr. Shuffler had previously taken Mr. A. T. Jackson

Pictographs

On the limestone stratum along the edge of the
escarpment are over a hundred mortar holes. These
vary in depth from eight to fourteen inches, in width
from five to nine inches, and in length from seven
to fourteen inches long. No pestles were found.
See No. 3, Plate 26.

On the ceiling of the shelter near the back is a
pictograph of a human hand. It is dark red and about
the size of an average adult hand. On the rock face
above the spring, fifty feet north of the shelter is a

CARVED ROCK SHELTER
BY VICTOR J. SMITH
Like other dry rock shelters located in the Big
Bend of Texas, the one described in these pages
yielded evidence basic to the territory and rather to
be expected in all such investigations. Also, like
the others, it developed certain interesting
characteristics of its own. In this case points of
special interest lie in the variety of rock carvings at
the site; additional sandal types; unusual sizes in
corn cobs; and a greater variety of flint artifacts,
including two hafted hatchets, than is usually found
in similar shelters.

(“V” shaped grooves) in irregular directions, sizes,
and forms though the general direction or trend of
lines is vertical. The evidence with respect to the
relative age of the carvings indicates that the drilled
holes represent the oldest group, since they are
found on the bottoms of early rock falls upon which
the fresher line carvings mentioned occur upon the
sides and tops. It seems evident, from an
examination of the position and nature of the
carving, that falls occurred throughout long periods
of time during Indian occupation and with a larger
historic fall in 1914, and some additions during the

About 70 pieces of cordage includes knots of
several types, string, etc. The main features of this
group are discussed as follows:
Cordage, Matting, and Basketry
An unusual feature of the cordage found lies in
the large number of square knots observed. Most
of these knots seem to be made from narrow strips
of fibre which had been tied in circular form from
three to six inches in diameter. From evidence found
elsewhere, we presume that these ties were used to
secure bundles of desert fibre materials, sage, or
other useful plants. Large coarse knots in

111

considerable number form another feature of the
cordage group. Few pieces of two-strand twisted
cordage are in evidence but the diameters from 364” to 3-32” indicates the small size range though
the shelter yielded the largest single mass of this
fine cordage which has come under my observation.
An interesting use of cordage appears in the
specimen of cacti roots tied together for ease in
carrying.
Fragments of matting indicated a limited use of
checker weave, not uncommon in the area. Twilled
matting, with weave two over and two under
(woven elements from 1-8” to 5-32” wide), is
represented by two good specimens. One, quite new
and clean in appearance, was found at a depth of
10” in the rear shelter, and another, quite dark in
color, but with a portion of selvage, formed a part
of the pit lining described later. A third type of
matting, represented by a small fragment, is the
twined type, in this case a small, flat, two-stick
bundle held together by twined cordage at intervals
of 3-8”.
Only two fragments of basketry have been
recorded from the site, both being the Big Bend
type of coiled basket assembled with a V split stitch
described in Bulletin No. 7 of the Texas
Archeological and Paleontological Society.
Other interesting forms of the use of cordage,
which uses have been observed to the West as far
as Van Horn, Texas, are: the sewing of gourds; the
tying of cordage to sticks as it to make a trigger;
and the use of reed, probably for making mats. The
specimen of bone tied with cordage, however, is
the first such use observed.
Sandals
Among the eleven sandals located are, as might
be expected, the usual fish-tail and weaves of
coarser texture.* The writer has, however, been
particularly interested in two sandal types not
commonly found, at least with such distinct
roundness of toe as the ones located at Carved Rock
Shelter. At depths of 15 1-2” and 18” (in pit lining)
these Round Toe Sandals suggest ages relatively
older than the more common types, though one fish-

Gourd sherds added their testimony to the

the practice of sewing or mending broken fragments
with thread of desert fibre. Gourds have been
located elsewhere which were covered with formed,

recent use of the mortar and pestle, with the muller
and metate distributed from the surface to the
extreme depths. The fact that the metate group

Pecos.
Cists
The five small cists or storage pits
were all typical of similar devices
observed elsewhere in the Big Bend.
While none actually contained
materials of value, several yielded
specimens by virtue of the fact that
sandals and matting fragments were
used as lining in the construction of
the pits. These cists are circular in
form and shaped somewhat like a
basin, usually about 18” in diameter
at the top and well lined with sticks,
grasses, leaves, and other vegetable
products.
Stone Objects
In addition to the carved lines
previously described as a feature of
this shelter, several smaller
individual stones show similar
carvings, such as grooves, or drilling
on two sides. The illustration
indicates clearly the complete variety
and relative sizes of points and
blades found in relation to depth.
While the number of such flint
articles was not large, the quality and
form were above the average for
most of the caves. We know of no
other double barbed point found
under similar conditions in West
Texas. The heavy fist hatchet was
located 31” under normal grade and
was situated in a small extension of
the shelter which, when excavated,
formed an addition to the rear. This
situation suggested a greater
antiquity for this particular specimen
than for much of the other materials.

When first observed, the type of hafted hatchet
illustrated was thought also to be unusual to the
Big Bend. Subsequent research, however, has
shown a number of similar blades from a variety of
sites, which suggests the possibility of general use
in the district. These most interesting specimens
were evidently of relatively recent origin as they
were found on top of one of the older rock falls,
and under a more recent slab. The well preserved
condition is surprising for articles unburied. We
presume that these hafted hatchets were used in
cutting fibrous desert plants since it is evident that
they are not substantial enough for weapons or
heavy cutting of any nature. A third blade, without
haft, was located in the nest of a rodent a short
distance from the two surface specimens.

unearthed, however, were of unusual variety and
quality. Among these the three hatchet blades, first
hatchet of the coup de poing type, double barbed
and other points are most interesting. We have
previously called attention to the variety and extent
of rock carvings and that additional types of sandals
were discovered.

Three small pictographs were observed on the
walls of the shelter. Two are in the typical cinnabar
red, and represent forms like a wishbone and a
rectangular area with a small circle within. The third,
orange in color, is a circle with two diagonal lines
on an angle of about 45 degrees.

the Big Bend Cave people. For students who seek
more detailed information, the complete field notes
are available at the museum in Alpine.

Further evidence was accumulated pointing to
the fact that the muller and metate were used
universally by the older inhabitants of the Big Bend
caves and that the mortar and pestle were more
recent additions to the utensils employed in the
preparation of food. It is also evident that the basinlike cists or storage pits which have been described

prehistoric Pawnee.2 Many dissimilarities are
apparent when these local midden cultures are
compared with the Texas Panhandle Cultures.3

Grass Covered Lodges
Castaneda and others have left us descriptions
of the large grass-covered habitations of the
Wichita.4. One observer reports a diameter for these
houses of as much as 25 feet. 5 Athanase de
Mezieres, who visited Spanish Fort in 1778,
described the dwellings as numbering 123, and each
containing 10 or 12 beds.6
It is not known definitely, just who was the first
white man to visit the Spanish Fort Indian Village.
However, it is apparent from the written records
available that the spot was a veritable crossroads
for early explorers, missionaries, traders, travelers,
army expeditions and Indian Tribes. The ill-fated

tribes; reports that certain Indians south of the
Platte, possibly had horses as early as 1600. Wissler
thinks that the Pawnee may have had horses as early
as 1630. It is likely that the Indians of the Spanish
Fort area obtained horses as soon as if not prior to
the above cited dates.

Dr. Robert T. Hill, the geologist and historian,
has carefully studied the disputed journal of
Coronado. Dr. Hill thinks that the expedition
entered Texas on the great plains, descended into
Red River through the Palo Duro Canyon, and
thence eastward to a large Indian Settlement at the
present site of Spanish Fort. Dr. Hill also thinks
that De Soto’s men entered Texas after the death
of the great leader, and pushed westward as far as
Spanish Fort. This was in 1542, and it is now
thought that through information from the Indians,
De Soto’s followers had learned of the white men
(Coronado’s Expedition) and had sought to make
connection with them.9 In 1719, La Harpe may have
brought the French into contact with the Wichita.
It is claimed that the French flag was flying at the
Wichita villages before 1750. Without doubt,
supplies of flintlock guns were in their hands at an
early date. Metal parts of flintlock guns are found
in large numbers in the site even today after years
of careful search by hordes of collectors.

Apparently after 1700, French trade with the
Wichita at Spanish Fort was important and was
carried on through the Arkansas posts. The Indians
traded horses and mules stolen from the Spanish
settlements and Apache slaves intended for the
Louisiana plantations.13

The bow and arrow remained in use for many
years in this area after the introduction of firearms.
In 1853, the expedition of Lieut. A. W. Whipple,
met two Waco Indians in what is now McClain
County, Oklahoma. The Indians carried bows of
Bois d’arc, three feet long and quivers filled with
arrows about 26 inches in length with very sharp
steel heads. This statement describing the steel
arrow-heads is of special interest. The copper and
iron arrow-heads from Spanish Fort were carefully
shaped with thin, sharp lateral edges and penetrating
points. The copper points vary greatly in size for
some unknown reason.
First Horses
Robert La Salle wrote in 1682, that the Pawnee
possess horses which they obtain from the Kiowa,
who steal their supplies from the Spaniards of New

A climax was reached in 1758, when the Wichita
and their partisans destroyed the San Saba Mission,
located hundreds of miles from Spanish Fort. A
retaliatory Spanish expedition marched from San
Antonio the next year in August. Captain Don
Diego Ortiz was in command. He found the Indians
on Red River, strongly fortified within a ditch and
a stockade.
Battle of Spanish Fort
Parrilla probably had previous knowledge of this
entrenched village and was well supplied with
cannon. A decisive battle was fought on October 7,
1759, and Parrilla received a humiliating defeat. He
hurriedly withdrew leaving baggage and two cannon
in the hands of the Indians. Only last year (1937) a
small iron cannon ball was discovered in a nearby
field; possibly a relic of this battle.
Meteorite
Athanase de Mezieres visited portions of North
Texas in 1772, but was unsuccessful in recovering
Parrilla’s lost cannon. While on the trip he received
descriptions from the Indians of a great iron mass.
Presumably, this is the meteorite in The University
of Texas collection that was obtained by Captain
Neighbors in 1856. The locality for this meteorite
is given as on the east side of the Brazos River
sixty miles from Ft. Belknap, direction not given.15
Some students have placed the locality for this
meteorite in Clay County, just a few miles west of
the area under discussion in this paper.

Spanish Fort, An Historic Wichita Site

1778 Expedition 16
De Mezieres reached Spanish Fort in 1778 and
named the village, Don Teodora. The two long lost
cannon were returned to him before he left the town.
During his stay in the locality, he wrote a number
of wonderful, descriptive letters. The writer’s
investigations have corroborated some of the things
mentioned in these letters. The Grand Forest
mentioned, is of course the well known Western
Cross Timbers that followed the strike of the Trinity
Formation for many miles southward into Texas.
De Mezieres wrote—The quarries furnish
whetstones, metates, white stones for lance heads,
flint stones for arrows and to make fire. The metates
from the site are usually specimens of indurated
sandstone from the Lower Permian strata which
outcrop at no great distance.

117

The white stones are from the base of the Trinity
Division of the Lower Cretaceous which outcrop a
few miles south and eastward of the locality. The
base of the Trinity formation is marked by a
quartzose conglomerate composed of well rounded
quartz grains. This bed was evidently deposited in
clear water as indicated by the fact that there is
hardly any mud or silt in the conglomerate.
Conglomerate appears to be present everywhere
in the base of the Trinity and is a reliable and
persistent horizon.16 The stone is usually well
cemented, and fractures easily across the grains into
large conchoidal flakes, which usually have a white,
vitreous luster. Artifacts of this material are
sometimes found in brownish hues; the stone alters
to this color when exposed to fire. These Trinity
beds were one of the major sources of “flint”
supplies for the Indians of this region; tools of this

THE OCCURRENCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF BEVELED KNIVES
BY SYBIL POTEET
The term beveled has come to be applied to a
particular type of flint implement which may have
two or more cutting blades. These blades are found
on alternate sides of the implement. There are four
main types of the beveled knife, as follows: Type A
is a beveled knife with four cutting edges, the two
on the shorter end of the knife not being as definitely
beveled as are the ones on the longer blade. Type B
is the diamond shaped four edged knife. Type C
may be called the spiral knife. Type D is the two
beveled knife. Except in extremely rare cases,
usually where the flint or other material had a very
poor fracture, all beveled knives will fall into one
of these four types. Quite a bit of confusion has
resulted from the fact that there are many varieties
of knives which appear to be beveled on two sides,
but are not of the four types seen in most abundance.
With definite criteria in mind for definition of
beveled knives, the writer has studied at first hand
as many of these variations as possible. Those
beveled on alternate sides and faces, having only
minor workings on the under side of each bevel,
are all that have been considered. The writer was
reluctant to list as beveled knives those with what
seem to be only incidental bevels, especially without
personally examining the specimens.

Taking the history of beveled knives in
chronological order, we find many facts to support
the theory that they are very recent. By far the
greater majority of beveled knives are found on the
surface, in every locality where they are found at
all. Obviously, however, too much credence should
not be given to the position of artifacts found
directly on the surface of sand blow-outs; which
occur frequently in the semi-arid Southwest. Wind
action would naturally take away the fine light
material, and the flint and stone being heavier would
sift down and become closely related with lower
lying material.

In certain sections of the country under this
limited survey, beveled knives have been found
deeply stratified, sometimes even in company with
Yuma and Folsom material. From a Small Scraper
Culture site in Taylor County, Dr. Cyrus N. Ray
collected several patinated four edged knives. In
the same site were channeled Folsom-like points.1
Mr. Adolph Witte found patinated points in Clay
County which are of the same type as those found
in historic and late prehistoric sites, and which are
nowhere found in earlier deposits. Patination,
usually taken to be an indication of great age, does
not apply to flint from the Alabates Creek along
A great many theories have been advanced the Canadian River, because Alabates flint

The Occurrence and Distribution of Beveled Knives
Mr. William B. Baker, a collector of some
experience in the Panhandle region, reported finding
what he calls the side-notch point in relation to the
beveled knife throughout the Panhandle territory.
The side notch is a small arrow point with a notch
on each side of the base perpendicular to the axis.
They are distinguished from the so called corner
notch points of about the same size, whose notches
are chipped in at about a forty-five degree angle to
the axis. The corner notch point, according to Mr.
Baker, is typical of one stem of western culture,
and the side-notch point belongs to another, the
Post Basketmaker of the Plains. “I am inclined to
believe that the side notch point belonged to the
age of Pueblos four and five,” he added.

The southernmost limit of recorded beveled
knives is in Calhoun County.2 Only a very faint
beveling, almost indistinguishable, can be seen on
this specimen. Two pieces, one beveled and the
other unbeveled but having the same shape, were
made of black and of brown flint and were fairly
well worked. Both were surface finds and similar
to the Type A beveled knife.
In Kinney County were found three knives on
the surface. One has four bevels. The other two are
very Yuma-like and the shapes are identical;
however, one is beveled near the smaller end. Colors
range from gray to rosy-cream.

averaging only three inches for the three Type C
knives. All these knives were found on the surface.3
From Howard County came only one beveled
knife. It is of light tan colored flint and of very poor
workmanship. It is a crude Type C and measures a
little over three inches.
It is singular that out of 3000 flint specimens at
the Hays Museum at Monahans, only three are
beveled knives.

From Brown County the University of Texas has
sixteen beveled knives. This county is the farthest
limit of the flat thin diamond shaped knife referred
to previously. The specimen found on the surface
in Brown County is only three and one-fourth inches
in length and is of cream colored flint and very well
worked, as are all of the knives of this type. The
seventeen beveled knives divide themselves into
seven type A’s, one Type B, two Type C’s with six
variations and one Type D. Three of these are of
the creamy brown semi-translucent greasy
appearing flint called “beeswax.” The others are
of cream colored and blue flint. The knives average
four inches in length, with the longest single blade
being of the Type D, measuring four and one-third
inches. All of the knives are the products of excellent
workmanship, some approaching the Yuma in
excellence of technique. All were surface finds.
From the records of Dr. J. T. Patterson came
information that beveled knives had been found in
a mound in Uvalde County and caves in Val Verde
County. These knives are not recorded in full.
From the surface finds of Brewster County came
two beveled knives. One is questionably of brown
flint and the other is of gray chert. They are four
and five and one-half inches long, respectively.
Ward County yielded five beveled knives, three
of Type C and one of Type B. All were poorly
worked and all but one are of gray flint. The
remaining one is of gray chert. These knives are
much smaller than the same type seen elsewhere,

PLATE 34.
Types A, B, C and D beveled knives.

The Occurrence and Distribution of Beveled Knives
There are over one hundred specimens, including
fragments of beveled knives in the collection of Dr.
Cyrus N. Ray of Abilene, Texas. These all came
from three different types of sites. First, of course,
are those picked up at random on the surface. Next
are knives which have been found in what Dr. Ray
terms the Small Scraper sites in which pottery is
found; then there are the finds from the Large
Scraper sites. These sites are mostly situated in
Taylor County, with only a few specimens from
Jones and one in Mitchell. In five sites alone, all of
which are situated in Taylor County, Dr. Ray listed
ninety-one bevelled knives. The greatest number
to a site was forty-five and they were found in Site
Seventeen, a Small Scraper Culture Pottery Site.4
Of the forty-five found in this site only seventeen
were unpatinated. However, in most sites nearly
all four edged knives are unpatinated. Prevailing
types of flint in this region are the blue gray
Edwards’ Plateau flints, and a sandy colored flint
with occasional reddish enclosures. These are
apparently the same types of flints that came from
the Taylor County Edwards’ Plateau mines and the

an odd variation. There are four bevels, and all are
more or less equal in length, but one side of the
implement is almost straight, when normally each
side would be very much like the other. The knives
were found near a number of side notch points.
From Hale County the West Texas Museum has,
from the collections of Mr. Floyd Seaman and Mr.
W. G. McMillan, eight beveled knives. Four of these
are of Type A, three are of Type B, and one is of
Type D. One of the Type A and one of the Type B
are of Alabates flint; one of the Type B is of cream
colored and the rest are of gray Edwards’ Plateau
flints, some having quartzite enclosures. Average
length is three and one-quarter inches, with the
shortest being a two and one-half inch specimen,
of Type B, with elongated parallel sides. The
workmanship is very good on all the knives from
Hale County.
Mr. Floyd V. Studer reported eleven beveled
knives from the “Panhandle” ruins of that region.
All are of Alabates material and all are of Type B,
showing a striking similarity to each other. Six of
the eleven came from Ruin No. 55, which is thirtyeight miles north of Amarillo. Four of the knives in
Mr. Studer’s collection came from Ruin No. 28 and
one from Ruin No. 84.

Length of these knives ranges from six to four
inches, most of them being about four and one-half
inches long. Widths average an inch and a quarter.

The Colorado Museum of Natural History,
according to Miss Betty Holmes, acting curator of
archaeology, has a great number of the beveled
knives gathered from all parts of Colorado. Nine
knives were reported from the Anderson collection
from Yuma, Colorado, which were found in blowouts in relation to Yuma and Folsom material. Two
are of Type A, one is of type B, and the rest are
fragmentary. Argillite, quartzite, and chalcedony are
mate-rials used in these knives. There is a noticeable
absence of Alabates material. The whole knives
average three and one-third inches in length.
From Mr. R. G. Atwood of Rawlins, Wyoming,
came the information that the type D of beveled
knife was very numerous in that vicinity. A corner
tang beveled knife was reported by Mr. Atwood to
have been found four feet below the surface. Six
others of type D were found on the surface in the
vicinity of Dade, Wyoming. These knives are of
quartzite, quartz, and argillite and average three
inches in length and an inch and a half in width and
are very thick.

Dallam County is also represented in the
collection of Mr. Montgomery. Ten beveled knives
came from that county. Of these surface finds, three
are of Type A, two are of Type B, two are of Type
C, and three are of Type D. Seven of the knives are
of Alabates and four are of gray material. One of
the Type D knives was found near Folsom material
in a blow out. Others were found with late Plains
material. The knives average four and one-third

Different types seem to be more prevalent in
certain places. For instance, almost all the beveled
knives found in Wyoming are of Type D, the great
majority from the Panhandle Culture Ruins are Type
B, and in Oklahoma are Type D knives also, but
these show distinct variation from the knives in
Wyoming. The farther south the study progressed,
the more of a mixture of the different types was
found. Knives from different localities were made
of flint or other material from that locality or near
by, indicating that the technique of making the knife
was exchanged and not merely the knives
themselves. The reasons why people in a certain
place should adopt and cling to the making of one
type of beveled knife in particular, are only to be
conjectured. Perhaps one particular craftsman liked
to specialize in that type of knife and made most of
the knives in the community; perhaps a certain type
of knife was easier to make with the materials at
hand or perhaps they had that type of knife and the
inhabitants lacked the reason and initiative to make
another type.

LONG CHANNELLED POINT FOUND IN ALLUVIUM
BESIDE BONES OF ELEPHAS COLUMBI
BY KIRK BRYAN

AND

Under conditions similar to those of other
recently reported finds1, 2 mammoth bones and a
Folsomoid point have been found together in a
locality about thirty miles southwest of Abilene. This
site lies on a dry branch of Mulberry creek, where
an alluvial cap on bed rock has been eroded by the
channel of the main stream, and its tributaries.
The site was discovered by Cyrus N. Ray in July,
1929, and reported by him in 1930 as a locality
where he had found large channelled points of
Folsom appearance. 3 In that report several
generalized Folsom and other flint artifact types
found in this place were described, and illustrated,
as well as the center of one Folsom point similar to
those found at the original locality. The illustrations
also show two components of the Clear Fork
Culture Complex4 from the same site, a flake side
scraper found embedded in a vertical bank at a depth
of eight feet below the top soil surface, and a Clear
Fork gouge.

CYRUS N. RAY

Ray, Prof. Kirk Bryan and his student assistant,
Samuel Vaughan, were conducted to the site, and
while Bryan and Ray were inspecting the
outcropping bones, Vaughan noticed about an inch
of the exposed base of a flint dart head firmly
embedded in the red earth of the bank, on the same
level as the bones, and on the north edge of the
small hole excavated by Drs. Sellards, Ray and
Watts in 1935.
This blade is 3 9-32 inches long, although it is
estimated that about one-fourth inch of the tip of
the point has been broken off. Its width at the base,
1 1-16 inches, is about the same for about 1 1-2
inches, where it begins to gradually taper off toward
the point. The blade narrows slightly at about an
inch from the base, and the edges near the base are
polished smooth. The blade is of local bluish flint,
and it has the same kind of mineral incrustations
that are so common on the Clear Fork Culture flints
at the same site. The channel on one face is 1 5-8
inches long, and that on the other face is 1 1-16
inches.

A trench 40 feet long was dug

Only one flint chip was found.
The number and disposition of the
bones show that they were
brought to place by the stream
that deposited the gravel
enclosing them and the finergrained reddish alluvium
overlying them. The Folsomoid
point must have been carried by
the same current. The alluvium of
this locality overlies bed rock and
has a variable thickness reaching
10 feet. It is hard and compact
with limey concretions and thus
has a considerable antiquity. The
near position of the mammoth
bones and the Folsomoid point is
the result of an ancient flood in
which both were transported. It
is an interesting speculation that
the Folsom point may have been
located in the fleshy part of the
head but the excavation of the site
affords no definite evidence to
this effect. The skull, various
other bones and the point seem
to have been rolled in together.
There is also no certain evidence
that the Folsomoid points are
contemporaneous with any part
of the Clear Fork Culture. It is,
however, fair to conclude that the
Folsomoid point is as old as the

this younger alluvium whereas the Folsomoid point
found on July 4 is definitely from the older

Thus far thirteen large museum cases have been

the various institutions represented. The Texas
Archeological and Paleontological Society has
bought and paid for five large museum cases, which
are installed in the museum, and filled with
collections made by the Society’s president. One
case contains only specimens of the Clear Fork

contains only specimens of the Small Scraper

shown specimens of Folsom and Abilene points
found near Abilene, and other types of very ancient
flint artifacts.
New Evidences of Ancient Man in Texas,
Found During Prof. Kirk Bryan’s Visit

Prof. Kirk Bryan was informed of the discovery,
and arrived in Abilene on July 1st and on July 3rd,
1938, helped remove the remainder of the bone.
On the same day Prof. Bryan was conducted to a
section of the same high vertical bank 1500 feet
down the creek, referred to above. Here Bryan also
found several man made flint flakes embedded in
place. It is quite probable that the gravel deposit
up the stream, which contained the Elephas bone,
is of the same age as the stratum of gravel which
overlies the three midden levels situated lower down
stream in the same creek bank.
The writer discovered the whole Abilene series
of deeply buried sites in the years 1929-1930, and
first described some of them in Science NewsLetter, Traces of Ancient Man Reported, Dec. 21,
1929, and the deeper Gibson Site series in Vol. 2,
1930 Bulletin of this Society, pp. 47-52, plates 1114-15.

the Elephas bone are all included in the same site,
which he named the Gibson Site in January, 1930.
Later that year the site was shown to E. B. Sayles
and much later (1934) Sayles showed it to Morris
Leighton.
Still later in 1936 Sayles and Leighton published
a report on the writer’s sites. In their later report
they divided the Gibson Site’s series of ancient levels
into Station 5, and Station 6. Leighton distinguished
the two series of beds the Elm Creek Silts and the
Durst Silts. The Abilene points reported in this
Society’s Bulletin came from below the
unconformity in what Leighton terms the Durst Silt.
On July 2nd, 1938, the writer took Prof. Bryan
and assistant, on a tour of ancient buried midden
levels along the Brazos River, and at the Hodges
Site situated eighteen miles from Abilene, the writer
found an Abilene point firmly embedded in silt at a
depth of 21 feet below the soil surface. Mr. Vaughan
then photographed it in place, (See Plate 37, Nos.
2 and 3) and Prof. Bryan then dug it out. At this
site there are three superimposed midden strata
above where the knife was found. Also see Vol. 9,
1937, of the Society’s Bulletin, Plate 37, Nos. 1-23, for pictures of this Site’s midden strata. The blade
found while Prof. Bryan was present was 1 1-2 feet
below the lowest stratum outlined in the 1937
pictures, and as Professor Bryan pointed out was
in the Durst Silt.
CYRUS N. RAY.
Deep Sites Near Abilene Texas
On July 2 to 4 I had the privilege of visiting
some of the localities of archeological interest near
Abilene through the courtesy of and accompanied
by Dr. Cyrus N. Ray.
I inspected the Gibson site on Elm Creek
described by Ray1 and confirmed the geological
description by Leighton.2 (Station 5) The Durst silts
are a hard compact reddish alluvium containing
irregular bands of clay or gravel. The most notable
characteristic of these beds is the leaching of much
of the lime from the upper portion and the
deposition of films of illuvial clay in the holes left
by solution of concretions and also in films through

the mass of the beds. The culture horizons with
flint and charcoal are well within the Durst silt and
below the erosional contact on which the Elm Creek
silts rest.
Led by Dr. Ray to a place about 1500 feet up
stream (part of Gibson Site, Ray 1930, or Station
6, Leighton 1936), I helped him excavate a part of
a mammoth bone, previously discovered and partly
excavated by him. The bone lay at the base of the
bank almost at creek level. Although no artifacts
have been found at this place, the material is red,
compact, and contains plates of illuvial clay. It is
obviously the same formation as at the locality
originally described by Ray downstream. See Plate
37, No. 1.
The bone was worn and incomplete and
obviously transported by the ancient Elm Creek
with the gravel of the Durst silt. However, the
breaks were not sharp breaks nor were there present
other evidences of mineralization and hardening of
the bone before transportation. It would, therefore,
seem that the bone is evidence that the mammoths
were contemporary with the Durst silt, an
association not previously established.3
At the Hodges site situated on the Brazos River
about 18 miles north of Abilene, I was fortunate in
being present when Dr. Ray found a well-worked
point projecting from the hard compact Durst silts
at a depth of about 21 feet below the bank. This
point is a characteristic rough-chipped Abilene type
such as Dr. Ray collected from the Gibson site
previously mentioned. See Plate 37, Nos. 2-3.
The characteristic appearance of the Durst silts,
their obvious antiquity compared to the overlying
and unconformable Elm Creek silts affords an
unparalleled opportunity for further collecting and
excavation. Adequate collections of materials
definitely in place in these two formations would
throw much new light on the chronology of early
man in Central Texas.

Scientists Visit Texas Sites
In December Dr. A. E. Jenks, Head of the
Anthropology Department of the University of
Minnesota visited Abilene for several days and again
examined Site Mc. (where the Folsomoid Point was
later found). Dr. Jenks had previously examined this
site with the writer in 1929. At the time of Dr. Jenks’

133

visit conditions were quite dry and no evidence was
showing of the later found artifacts which came
after some heavy rains had further eroded the silts.
Dr. Jenks also then examined the superimposed
middens of the Gibson Site, where the other elephas
bone was later found in gravel. During the winter
Mr. William H. Campbell and Mrs. William Crozier
Campbell of Twenty Nine Palms,
California, visited Abilene and examined
the flint collections. In March Profs. J.
Charles Kelley of Sul Ross State
Teachers College, and Thomas Campbell

buried sites at Abilene. In June Dr. W.
C. Holden of Lubbock and some
research students studied the flint
collections in Abilene.
The Society’s Finance Committee
Until this year the Society’s president
has had to look after the raising of special
funds for carrying on the different
activities of the Society, as well as doing
the great amount of work involved in
editing the Bulletin. Even though the
editorial work is spread out over a year’s
time, and can be done a little at a time,
the burden has been an ever increasing
one, as the Bulletin has expanded in size,
and the Society’s interests have
increased.
Therefore the president has this year
appointed a committee of members to
take over the details of the financing of
special funds, and other such
arrangements.
