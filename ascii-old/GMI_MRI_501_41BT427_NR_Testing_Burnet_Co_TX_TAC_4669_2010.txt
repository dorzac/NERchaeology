MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Between October 1 and October 19, 2007, archeologists from Geo-Marine, Inc., conducted
National Register of Historic Places eligibility testing at site 41BT427 in Burnet County, Texas,
under contract to the Texas Department of Transportation, Environmental Affairs Division. This
prehistoric site was originally recorded by PBS&J during a cultural resources survey for a
proposed bridge replacement project at the North Rocky Creek crossing of FM 963 (CSJ 119802-017). During that investigation, the site was initially identified by a series of three trenches
located on the northeastern quadrant of the right-of-way. Three small, burned rock features were
originally recorded in two of the trenches.
During the current project by Geo-Marine, the bridge replacement area was again investigated.
Thirteen trenches were dug within the project area: nine survey trenches in the northwest,
southwest, and southeast quadrants outside the known boundary of site 41BT427, and four
trenches within the site itself in the northeast quadrant. The current investigation within site
41BT427 involved the mechanical excavation of the four trenches (29.5 linear meters) and the
hand excavation of eight test units (8.94 cubic meters) within the site boundary (an additional test
unit was excavated south of the site boundary). Only one definable cultural component was
identified at site 41BT427. This site appears to represent an ephemeral, short-term camp with a
very sparse material signature. No diagnostic material was recovered during excavation. The
single feature identified consisted of a very small, disarticulated cluster of six burned rocks and a
limited amount of cultural material. The general lack of cultural material and feature/artifact
associations within the site hampers the ability to draw conclusions regarding site function and
prehistoric activity.
Due to the low artifact density and the lack of cultural features, site 41BT427 does not have the
potential to make significant contributions to the knowledge of the region. Thus, site 41BT427
fails to meet the standards of Criterion D or any other significance standard required for assessing
National Register eligibility. Site 41BT427 is recommended not eligible for National Register
inclusion, and no further archeological investigations are recommended.
In addition to site testing, survey trenching (as well as an additional test unit) within the
remaining three quadrants that was not completed during the initial PBS&J cultural resources
survey was conducted as a part of this Geo-Marine investigation. Based on trench observations
iii

and background research, this proposed borrow area is highly unlikely to contain archeological
historic properties (36 CFR 800.16:[I]) or State Archeological Landmarks (13 TAC 26.12), and
no further archeological investigations are recommended for these areas.

The successful completion of the testing work at site 41BT427 would not have been possible
without the opportunity and guidance provided by the Texas Department of Transportation,
Environmental Affairs Division, archeologist Jon Budd. Geo-Marine’s testing at site 41BT427
was carried out by Jennifer Anderson, Lana Martin, Bethany Oliver, and Matt Cuba under the
supervision of Project Archeologist Tiffany Osburn and Principal Investigator Missi Green.
In the Geo-Marine laboratory, Steve Hunt and Bethany Oliver processed and recorded all
excavated materials. Paleobotanical analyses were performed by Leslie Bush, Ph.D. Erin King
produced the maps and diagrams in the report, and Sharlene Allday edited the text. Formatting
and document production were handled by Denise Pemberton. Without their efforts, this project
would not have been possible.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) proposes to replace the existing bridge and
approaches along FM 963 at North Rocky Creek (CSJ 1198-02-017) in Burnet County, Texas.
Cultural resources testing is required to comply with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1969, as amended (Public Law [PL] 89-665), the Department of
Transportation Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-670), and the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC), as incorporated
into Title 98, Chapter 191, of the Natural Resources Code of Texas of 1977, as amended.
Site 41BT427, which is within the area of potential effects (APE) of the TxDOT project, was
originally recorded in July 2007 by archeologists from PBS&J during a pedestrian survey of FM
963 for TxDOT (Nichols and Farabough 2007). Because the site will be affected by the proposed
construction, TxDOT Environmental Affairs Division (TxDOT-ENV) contracted with GeoMarine, Inc. (GMI), under contract/work authorization #57902SA005 to conduct National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility testing at site 41BT427. GMI archeologists
conducted the testing investigations between October 1 and October 19, 2007 (GMI project
number 22005.00.02). This current program of testing involved the excavation of a series of
trenches on all four quadrants of the intersection of North Rocky Creek and FM 963, where
feasible, within the APE (Figure 1). The APE is defined as the existing 80-foot wide right-ofway (ROW) and extending 400 feet on either side of the water line. The work was conducted
under TAC permit #4669, and this report details the results of the investigations.
Thirteen trenches were dug within the project APE: nine survey trenches in the northwest,
southwest, and southeast quadrants outside the known boundary of site 41BT427, and four
trenches within the site itself in the northeast quadrant. The current investigation within site
41BT427 involved the mechanical excavation of the four trenches (29.5 linear meters) and the
hand excavation of eight test units (8.94 cubic meters) within the site boundary. In addition to
site testing, survey trenching of the proposed borrow area—the remaining three quadrants, with
an additional test unit south of the known site boundary—that was not completed during the
initial PBS&J cultural resources survey was conducted as a part of this GMI investigation.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

INTRODUCTION
Site 41BT427 is located along North Rocky Creek (a tributary of the Lampasas River) within the
Lampasas Cut Plain of the Edwards Plateau region of Central Texas. The Lampasas Cut Plain is
essentially a northern extension of the Edwards Plateau (Johnson 2001). The topographic pattern
of the plain, however, is entirely different from much of the Edwards Plateau because the
dissection in the Lampasas Cut Plain is less severe. The region is characterized by mesa-type
topography with wide lowlands intervening between the mesa uplands.

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The flat-topped mesas of the region are capped with hard limestone, and the edges are margined
by a typical rim-rock vegetation. The lowlands may have somewhat sloping surfaces, in which
case, they usually are erosional and underlain with shallow caliche, or they may be completely
reduced to flatness, in which case, they have a smooth constructional surface and thick soils
(Johnson 2001). The Lampasas River is a major tributary of the Brazos River with a narrow
valley of mapped Holocene alluvium less than 1 kilometer (km; 0.6 mile [mi]) wide. The soils in
the project area are mapped as Oakalla silty clay loam (Figure 2), occasionally flooded (U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service [USDA, NRCS] 2010a).
This soil unit is characterized as alluvium derived from limestone and is found on floodplains.

VEGETATION
The vegetation of the Lampasas Cut Plain is characterized by deciduous woodlands of Texas oak
(Quercus spp.) and deciduous riparian forests of sugarberry (Celtis laevigata) and elm (Ulmus L.)
(Johnson 2001). A mosaic of grasslands and woodlands characterizes the vegetation of the
project area. Grasslands are mixed prairie, with tall, medium, and short grasses present. Upland
trees and shrubs typically grow in mottes of oaks, juniper (Juniperus spp.), and agarito (Mahonia
trifoliata). Yaupon (Ilex vomitoria) and deciduous holly (Ilex spp.), elbowbush (Forestiera
pubescens), persimmon (Diospyros texana), and sumac (Rhus trilobata) are common small trees
3

and shrubs. Moister areas along streams and mesic slopes support trees such as sycamore
(Platanus occidentalis), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), hackberry (Celtis spp.), and elm (Beaty
1978; Riskind and Diamond 1988)

FAUNA
Site 41BT427 occupies an area at the intersection of the Edwards Plateau and Cross Timbers
vegetation areas, creating a rich habitat for a variety of fauna. Native mammals common to the
region in the prehistoric period include opossum (Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus
aquaticus), eastern fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), hispid cotton
rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), coyote (Canis latrans),
grey fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), mink (Mustela vison), muskrat (Ondata zibethica), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), stripped skunk (Mephitis mephitis),white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
bison (Bison bison), and black bear (Ursus americanus) (Burt and Grossenheider 1976).
Amphibian and reptilian species of the region include Great Plains rat snake (Elaphe guttata
emoryi), eastern yellowbelly racer (Coluber constrictor), yellow mud turtle (Kinosternon
flavescan), bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), and southern leopard frog (Rana utricularia) (Kutac and
Caran 1994).

PALEOENVIRONMENT
Environmental and climatic conditions in Central Texas have changed dramatically since the
terminal Pleistocene. Bryant and Holloway (1985) depict the Central Texas region as being
dominated by deciduous forest until approximately 10,000 years ago. However, both Hall and
Valastro (1995) and Toomy et al. (1993) argue that the region was primarily mesic grassland.
The grassland hypothesis is supported in part by the megafauna recorded for the area during the
late Pleistocene. Species such as mastodon, mammoth, giant bison, camel, and horse would have
required extensive grassland resources (Dillehay 1974; Graham 1987; Toomey et al. 1993).
Subsequent to 10,000 years ago, climatic evidence suggests a gradual drying period with reduced
ground cover vegetation (Toomey et al 1993). The general drying trend that began during the late
Pleistocene is seen by Toomey et al. (1993) as continuing into the middle and late Holocene with
a peak at approximately 5,000–2,500 years ago. Wetter and warmer conditions were resurgent in
the region until approximately 1,500–1,000 years ago (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Johnson and
Goode 1994). Conditions consistent with modern climatic trends were established from this point
forward in Central Texas.

REGIONAL CULTURAL HISTORY AND PREVIOUS
INVESTIGATIONS

REGIONAL CULTURAL HISTORY
Several current regional chronologies (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994) are
utilized in the following discussion of Central Texas prehistory. The regional chronology is
divided into three basic periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric, each of which is
further subdivided in the following discussion (Table 1).

Prehistoric Cultural Chronology

Paleo-Indian (10,000–6800 B.C.)
Human occupation in Central Texas is generally agreed to have begun during the terminal
Pleistocene. This initial Paleo-Indian cultural period is dated to approximately 10,000–6800 B.C.
(Black 1989; Collins 1995, 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994). In Central Texas, the Paleo-Indian
period is divided into Early (10,000–8900 B.C) and Late (8900–6800 B.C.) subperiods. The Early
Paleo-Indian period is characterized by fluted Clovis projectile points along with prismatic blade
manufacture. Subsistence during this subperiod appears to have been diverse and consisted of
both megafauna (e.g., mammoth and extinct large bison) as well as smaller taxa such as badger,
alligator and moles (Collins et al. 1989). Prominent sites in the region with Early Paleo-Indian
components include the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault sites. The Late PaleoIndian continued with a mixed hunting-gathering tradition and is characterized by the Folsom and
Plainview point types (Collins 1998). Burned rock features made their first appearance in Central
Texas during the Late Paleo-Indian period (Masson and Collins 1995). Sites of note in the region
with Late Paleo-Indian components include Wilson-Leonard, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Mary’s
Hall.

Archaic (6800 B.C.–A.D. 750)
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) formulation of the Central Texas Archaic makes use of three
subdivisions: Early Archaic (6800–4000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (4,000–2000 B.C.), and Late
Archaic (2,000 B.C.–A.D. 750) based on point typologies.

Early Archaic (6800–4000 B.C.)
The Early Archaic in Central Texas is most known for its large burned rock midden sites that
commonly constitute multiple tons of fire-cracked rock. Although burned rock middens are first
noted in the Late Paleo-Indian period for Central Texas, they became a prominent site type by the
Early Archaic. The Early Archaic is generally defined by three projectile point style intervals:
Angostura, Early Split-stem, and Martindale-Uvalde (Johnson and Goode 1994). In addition to
burned rock middens, site types include open campsites (Loeve, Wilson-Leonard, and RichardBeene) and caves (Hall’s Cave). Subsistence evidence for the Early Archaic is varied, with deer,
small animal, fish, and plant bulb being common taxa. Pollen and fluvial geological evidence
suggest that environmental conditions during the period fluctuated between mesic and xeric
conditions (Collins 2004).

Middle Archaic (4000– 000 B.C.)
Bell/Andice/Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan/Travis constitute the three projectile point styles
indicative of the Middle Archaic period (Johnson and Goode 1994). The Bell/Andice/Calf Creek
point technology along with environmental data suggesting mesic conditions are seen by Collins
(1994) as evidence for a focus on bison hunting. However, by the latter portion of the Middle
Archaic, environmental conditions appear to have shifted again to being more xeric. The xeric
8

conditions of the latter Middle Archaic have been correlated with an increase in burned rock
midden deposits, and this association is believed to have been due to a greater reliance upon
tuberous plants such as sotol iris (Johnson and Goode 1994).

Late Archaic (2000 B.C.–A.D. 750)
According to Johnson and Goode (1994), the Late Archaic for Central Texas can be subdivided
into (ascending chronological order) six style intervals:
Bulverde, Pedernales/Kinney,
Lange/Marshall/Williams, Marcos/Montell/Castroville, Ensor/Frio/Fairland, and Darl. The Late
Archaic in Central Texas began with xeric conditions and progressively became more mesic.
Burned rock midden deposits continue to be a significant part of many site assemblages and
actually peak in density during the Pedernales/Kinney interval (Collins 2004). Dart points,
corner-tanged knives, and cylindrical stone pipes are associated with Late Archaic site
assemblages from Central Texas. A mixed hunting-gathering economy of large and small
animals as well as various reliable plants of the region (e.g., stool iris and pecan) became well
developed by the end of the Late Archaic and continued largely unchanged into the early Late
Prehistoric.

Late Prehistoric (A.D. 750–1540)
The Late Prehistoric period of the region is divided into Early (Austin interval) and Late (Toyah
interval) subperiods (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994). The evolution to the Late
Prehistoric period in Central Texas is signaled by the introduction of bow and arrow technology
that occurs during the Austin interval. Although the arrow point made its introduction in the Late
Prehistoric, it is initially underrepresented when compared to dart points. The later Toyah
interval of the Late Prehistoric is characterized by the dominance of the arrow point, specifically
the Perdiz type. The constellation of Perdiz arrow points, locally manufactured ceramics, end
scrapers, and prismatic blades is seen as an indication of a focus on large game animals (e.g.,
bison, deer, and antelope). Researchers currently disagree on whether this artifact assemblage
represents a techno-complex (Ricklis 1994) or an actual cultural group (Johnson 1994).

Historic Period (A.D. 1540–1900)
The Historic period began with the arrival of the first Europeans in the area, Coronado’s 1540–
1542 expedition to the Plains of Cíbola, the High Plains west of the study area (Castañeda
1554[1904]). Coronado’s chroniclers and those of later Spanish expeditions (e.g., Posada
1686[1982]) report that the region was occupied by Apacha (Apache) people. Based on Spanish
descriptions of Apache lifeways—with limited sedentism and a seasonal round of bison hunting
and foraging—it seems that the Garza and Toyah archeological complexes may represent early
Apache occupations (Boyd 1997). In an alternative interpretation that has not yet gained traction
in the Texas archeological community, Garza and other Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric
assemblages have also been linked to the Wichita (Baugh and Perkins 2008; Roberts and
Bradford 1997).

9

If Garza and/or Toyah indeed represent early Apache occupations, the Apache were the primary
native group in the area until the early to mid-eighteenth century, when nomadic Comanche
hunters arrived from the Great Basin and plains northwest of Texas (Lipscomb 2008). Various
Anglo, French, and Spanish traders maintained commercial relationships with the Apache and
Comanche, but the locations and timing of these interactions are debated; for instance, sites of the
Spanish traders known as comancheros have not been securely identified because ―no one is sure
what they should look like‖ (Freeman and Boyd 1997:82). Shoshonean-speaking Comanche
continued their presence in Central Texas until the end of the nineteenth century.
The area that was later established as Burnet County formed parts of both the Robertson and
Austin-Williams Mexican land-grant colonies. However, at the time of Texas Independence, the
majority of the land in the region was still public domain and unsettled (Bowden 1940). With the
annexation of Texas by the United States in 1845, the region became an important location on the
Comanche frontier with the establishment of the McCulloch’s station, and later Fort Croghan.
Burnet County was officially formed in 1852 from former parts of Travis, Bell, and Williamson
counties (Bowden 1940). By 1860, the county had 2,487 residents and three communities;
Smithwick, Oatmeal, and Backbone Valley (Bowden 1940). Cotton agriculture and stock rearing
(cattle, sheep, and goats) formed the basis of the Burnet County economy in the nineteenth
century and well into the modern period.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Prehistoric site 41BT427 was originally recorded by PBS&J during a cultural resources survey
for the proposed bridge replacement project at the North Rocky Creek crossing of FM 963
(Nichols and Farabough 2007). The work was conducted in June and July 2007 and included
pedestrian survey of the ROW as well as the excavation of four backhoe trenches in the
northeastern quadrant. Cultural materials associated with site 41BT427 were identified in two of
these trenches (PBSJ Trench 2 and PBSJ Trench 4). Three burned rock features were identified
in the trench profiles. No artifacts were observed during that investigation, though mammal bone
and charcoal were collected. Feature 1 was identified in PBSJ Trench 2 at a depth of 75
centimeters (cm) below surface (bs) and consisted of a linear concentration of burned limestone
rocks with no associated staining or charcoal. Feature 2 was identified in PBSJ Trench 2 at a
depth of 180 cm bs and consisted of a burned rock concentration with associated charcoal and
mammal bone. Feature 3 was identified in PBSJ Trench 4 at a depth of 180 cm bs and contained
only two burned rocks above a soil stain.
Trenching within the remaining three quadrants was not completed during the initial cultural
resources survey but was undertaken as a part of this current investigation.

CHAPTER 4
RESEARCH METHODS

FIELD METHODS
The first stage of fieldwork consisted of the excavation of 13 backhoe trenches within the APE:
four within the boundaries of site 41BT427 and nine survey trenches in the other three quadrants
(Figure 3). The backhoe trenches were placed to sample every landform within the APE.
Mechanical excavations were conducted with a toothed-bucket to various depths, with an
estimated average of 20–30-cm depth intervals. The location of each trench was recorded using
aglobal positioning system (GPS) device to record the position of both ends of every trench. Two
archeological monitors were present during the trench excavations. The goal of monitoring
mechanical excavations was to identify locations where artifact density was high enough to be
readily detectable and therefore potentially exploitable for hand excavation. In general, one
monitor watched the excavation to control depth and identify in situ materials, while the other
monitor watched the backdirt as it was dumped. All trenches were carefully scraped, profiled,
and recorded by the Project Archeologist. Standard soil taxonomy methods were used to provide
a measured description of a representative wall from each trench. All of the trenches were
photographed.
As specified in the scope of work, a series of hand-excavated 1-x-1-m test units was placed
adjacent to each of the four trenches at site 41BT427, as well as one test unit adjacent to the
trench south of the site (Figure 4). These units were placed on benches excavated adjacent to the
trenches. The original survey conducted at this site recorded no cultural material above 75 cm
and no material was identified during the current phase of trenching above this depth. Benches
were excavated to approximately 65–75 cm bs around excavation units. This served to create a
safety bench in accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) safety
standards as well as remove culturally sterile overburden. The test units were excavated in 10-cm
arbitrary levels from the level of the bench to depths ranging from 145–240 cm bs. Sediment
from the test units was screened through 0.625 millimeter (mm; 0.25 inch [in]) hardware cloth.
All lithic debris, chipped and ground stone tools, bone, and freshwater mussel shell were
collected. Rabdotus snails were counted for each level, and burned and unburned rock was
weighed and counted. Artifact counts and observations were made on standard unit-level forms.
Flotation samples and samples for fine screening were collected from levels containing
concentrations of cultural material, feature contexts, and nonfeature contexts in an effort to
recover minute charred plant remains and artifacts.
11

A site map was created using both GPS and total station data. First the Trimble® ProXRS
backpack GPS was used to collect locational data for each of the trenches, the road, the edge of
the APE, and various other reference points. During later hand excavation, the total station was
used to map the location of 1-x-1-m units adjacent to each trench, the datum points for each unit,
and the benches, and these data were overlaid with the GPS data to create an accurate map of site
41BT427.

LABORATORY PROCEDURES
All cultural material recovered during data recovery was returned to the GMI laboratory facilities
in Plano, Texas, to be washed, weighed, counted, catalogued, and labeled in compliance with
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) standards. Context and attribute data for all
materials were recorded in a Microsoft ACCESS database on an IBM network system. The main
categories of material recovered were animal bone, mussel shell, baked clay, lithics, botanical
samples (both flotation samples and opportunistically collected wood charcoal), and fire-cracked
rock (Appendix A). All artifactual material was analyzed in the GMI laboratory except the
botanical remains, which were sent to an external analyst. The following discussion describes
analytical strategies and summarizes the attributes recorded during the analysis of each class of
material.

Faunal Remains
Mammal
Every attempt was made to identify bone fragments to the highest taxonomic level possible.
Bone specimens not bearing diagnostic features but similar in size and other formal
characteristics were placed within the following specific size classes: small terrestrial mammal
(STM), medium terrestrial mammal (MTM), large terrestrial mammal (LTM), and very large
terrestrial mammal (VLTM). Assessments were also made of the following characteristics: bone
element, size/weight of fragment, fusion state, rodent gnawing, burning/butchery evidence,
number of identifiable specimens (NISP), and standard metric analyses.

Molluscan Shell
Molluscan specimens were counted using two quantitative units: number of specimens (NSP;
[identified and unidentified]) and NISP. Because samples were small, minimum number of
individuals (MNI) was not calculated. All attempts were made to identify specimens to taxon and
element.

Botanical Remains
Flotation samples were processed at the GMI Plano offices in a Siraf tank flotation system with
bottom mesh openings of 0.5 mm (Pearsall 2000:Figure 2.21). Flotation and carbon samples
were sent to a private contracting firm, Macrobotanical Analysis (Leslie Bush Ph.D., owner) in
February 2010 and the full report is contained within Appendix B.
14

Flotation samples were sorted according to standard procedures (Pearsall 2000). Each sample
was weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200 x 0.01 g electronic balance before being size-sorted
through a stack of graduated geologic mesh. Materials that did not pass through the No. 10 mesh
(2-mm square openings) were completely sorted. At 41BT427, only three categories were
present that were larger than 2 mm: carbonized macrobotanical remains, identifiable bones, and
contamination. The ―contamination‖ (i.e. not studied by the paleobotanist) category includes
uncarbonized botanical remains such as rootlets and hackberry seeds, gastropod and bivalve
shells, soil clumps, and rocks. All carbonized botanical remains and identifiable bones were
counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Contamination was weighed, recorded, and labeled
only. Materials that fell through the 2-mm mesh (―residue‖) were examined under a stereoscopic
microscope at 7-45 X magnification for carbonized botanical remains. Identifiable material was
removed from residue, counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Although wood charcoal
smaller than 2 mm is not usually removed from residue, so little wood charcoal was present in
three of the samples that wood charcoal greater than 0.7 mm was removed from Field Specimen
(FS) #60 and FS#61, and wood charcoal greater than 1.4 mm was removed from FS#65.
Uncarbonized macrobotanical remains were recorded on a presence/absence basis on laboratory
forms.
For each flotation sample, wood charcoal fragments were selected at random for identification.
Fragments were snapped to reveal a clean transverse section and examined under a stereoscopic
microscope at 28-180 X magnification. When necessary, tangential or radial sections were
examined for ray seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and sizes of intervessel pitting,
and other minute characteristics that can only be seen at the higher magnifications of this range.
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison to
materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of standard
reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; Martin and Barkley 1961;
Musil 1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980). Plant nomenclature follows that of the PLANTS
Database (USDA, NRCS 2010b).

Chipped Stone Tools and Debitage
The major prehistoric artifact class identified in the lithic analysis was lithic debitage. Of the 105
lithic artifacts collected, all but two were various pieces of flaking debris. Two bifaces, one of
which is a projectile point base, were recovered during the excavation. No ground, pecked, or
battered stone tools were found.
The lithic debitage was classified by technological reduction source (i.e., core flake, biface flake,
flake fragment, and shatter). Variables recorded for the lithic debitage included the technological
type of debitage, amount of dorsal cortex (if present), heat-treatment or burning, material type,
size range, and weight.

Baked Clay
Irregular, gravel-sized masses of hardened clay, many with evidence of oxidation, reduction, or
smudging due to fire, occurred in limited amounts in cultural levels in test units. A basic analysis
of these masses was performed in the GMI laboratory, where they were separated by size
15

categories. These categories included the following size classes: smaller than 0.5 in (12.7 mm),
0.5–1 in (12.7–25.4 mm), 1–1.5 in (25.4–38.1 mm), 1.5–2 in (38.1–50.8 mm), and larger than 2
in (50.8 mm). The cumulative weight and total number of baked clay masses within each class
and within each context were then recorded in the project ACCESS database.

Fire-Cracked Rock
Fire-cracked rock (FCR) was subjected to a similar basic analysis in the GMI laboratory.
Fragments were first sorted based by rock material type (e.g., limestone, quartzite, etc.), and any
direct evidence of heating (e.g., fracture pattern, discoloration) noted. Within material types, the
FCR was then sorted into size classes: smaller than 0.5 in (12.7 mm), 0.5–1 in (12.7–25.4 mm),
1–1.5 in (25.4–38.1 mm), 1.5–2 in (38.1–50.8 mm), 2–4 in (50.8–101.6 mm), 4–6 in (101.6–
152.4 mm), and larger than 6 in (152.4 mm). In the end, the final size class was not included in
the analysis because no FCR fragments larger than 6 in (152.4 mm) were found. The cumulative
weight and total number of FCR fragments within each class and within each archeological
context were then recorded in the project ACCESS database.

CURATION
Upon completion of the analyses and reporting, collected materials will be assessed for the
appropriateness for long-term curation.
The remaining collections from the project will be prepared for curation according to the
packaging guidelines established by TARL at the University of Texas, Austin. Field and
laboratory forms will be on acid-free paper; negatives and photographs will be labeled and placed
in acid-free holders; cleaned and labeled artifacts will be placed in appropriate bags and boxes
suitable for long-term storage. An inventory of materials submitted to curation will be prepared
and a copy will be sent with the collection to TARL for long-term storage; other copies will be
sent to TxDOT-ENV.

RESULTS OF THE TEST EXCAVATIONS

EXCAVATIONS

Trench Excavations
Four trenches (Trenches 10–13) were excavated within the boundary of site 41BT427 and nine
survey trenches (Trenches 1–9) were excavated along the ROW in the remaining three quadrants
of North Rocky Creek and FM 963 (see Figure 3). The nine trenches excavated in the southeast,
southwest, and northwest quadrants did not yield cultural material. Trenching within site
41BT427 totaled 29.5 linear meters. All of the trench descriptions are provided below.

Trench Descriptions

Trench 1
Trench 1 was excavated in the southwestern quadrant farthest from the creek. This trench was
excavated to a maximum depth of 160 cm bs before encountering limestone bedrock. The total
length of Trench 1 was 7 m. Generally, the deposits recorded in this trench indicate a sequence of
overbank deposits (Table 2, Figure 5). Gravel lenses in Horizons III and V indicate periods of
high-energy flow. No cultural deposits or buried soils were identified.

Trench 2
Trench 2 was also excavated in the southwestern quadrant of the APE. This trench reached a
total length of 6 m and was excavated to a maximum depth of 160 cm bs before encountering
limestone bedrock and regolith. No cultural materials or buried soil horizons were encountered in
this trench. This trench also records a sequence of overbank deposits including high-energy
deposition containing gravels in Horizon III (Table 3, Figure 6).

Trench 3
Trench 3 was also excavated in the southwestern quadrant nearest North Rocky Creek. This
trench was 7 m in length and was excavated to a maximum depth of 180 cm bs. At 176 cm bs,
sand and gravel deposits were encountered that began caving in and undercutting the trench
walls; excavation was halted so that trench recording could proceed safely. No cultural material
was identified, and no buried soil horizons are present in this location. Stream deposits dominate
the profile as would be expected for the floodplain of the North Rocky Creek (Table 4, Figure 7).

Trench 4
Trench 4 was excavated in the northwestern quadrant of the APE. This trench was 7.5 m long
and was excavated to a maximum depth of 167 cm bs before encountering gravel overlying
limestone bedrock. The upper two horizons visible in the trench wall consisted of fill, likely
resulting from road construction (Table 5, Figure 8). No cultural material was identified and no
buried soil was detected.

Trench 5
Trench 5 was also excavated in the northwestern quadrant, east of Trench 4. It was 7 m in length
and reached a maximum depth of 175 cm bs. This trench revealed a sequence of alluvial deposits
resulting from flood episodes. Two clear fining upward sequences were apparent in Horizons VI
and VII (Table 6, Figure 9). No indication of a buried soil or other stable surface was apparent,
and no cultural materials were identified.
Trench 6
Trench 6 was excavated in the northwestern quadrant of the APE. This trench was 5 m long and
reached a maximum depth of 195 cm bs. In general, the sediments observed in this trench
consisted entirely of overbank deposits with a layer of introduced gravely fill at the surface
(Table 7, Figure 10). No buried soil horizons were observed, and no cultural materials were
identified.

slabs retaining rebar were exposed (Table 10, Figure 13). It is likely that this material is
associated with previous bridge replacements. Below this fill gravel, channel deposits were
encountered.

Trench 10
Trench 10 was excavated in the northeastern quadrant of the APE at site 41BT427. This trench
was excavated to a maximum depth of 220 cm bs and was 7.5 m in length. A cluster of three
burned rocks was exposed in the north wall at approximately 80–85 cm bs (Table 11; Figure 14).
One additional burned rock was located a meter east of the cluster at 85–90 cm bs. Charcoal
flecks were scattered between 70–210 cm bs. No burned rock was apparent below 1 m, and there
was no evidence of the lower component identified when the site was originally recorded. Test
Units 4 and 5 were excavated adjacent to Trench 10.

Trench 11
Trench 11 was excavated in the northeastern quadrant of the APE, at site 41BT427. This trench
was excavated to a maximum depth of 220 cm bs and was 7.5 m in length. Charcoal was
observed throughout the profile between 70 and 210 cm bs. One bivalve shell and a burned rock
located in Horizon III, at 90 cm bs in the north wall, were the impetus for the placement of Test
Unit 2 along this trench (Table 12, Figure 15). A safety bench was excavated on the northern side
of the trench and overburden was removed to approximately 70 cm bs.

Trench 12
Trench 12 was excavated in the northeastern quadrant of the APE at site 41BT427. This trench
was excavated to a maximum depth of 217 cm bs and a total length of 7 m. No cultural material
or burned rock was observed in either profile of Trench 12, though charcoal was dispersed
throughout much of the trench below 75 cm (Table 13, Figure 16). Nevertheless, Test Unit 3 was
placed adjacent to Trench 12.

Trench 13
Trench 13 was excavated in the northeastern quadrant of the APE at site 41BT427. This trench
reached a maximum depth of 175 cm bs and a total length of 7.5 m. One large tabular piece of
limestone was removed from this trench during mechanical excavation but was not observed until
it was dumped into the backdirt pile (Figure 17). This limestone slab might possibly be ground

Test Unit Excavations
National Register eligibility testing at 41BT427 entailed the excavation of eight 1-x-1-m test units
within the boundary of the site (Test Units 2–9) and one test unit outside the known southern site
boundary (Test Unit 1). Each test unit was excavated adjacent to one of the four trenches
excavated within the site boundaries (see Figure 4). The additional test unit (Test Unit 1) was
placed outside the site across FM 963 adjacent to Trench 8 to test what appeared to be a
concentration of charcoal and a burned rock in the trench profile. Overall, excavations from the
testing yielded 105 chipped stone artifacts including one biface fragment and one projectile point
fragment, 59 pieces of bone, and 21 pieces of mussel shell (see Appendix A). As charcoal was
observed throughout the profile of each of these units, samples were collected within levels with
associated artifacts as well as randomly in levels with low artifact recovery. In addition, 82.2 g of
burned clay or burned earth were collected for inspection in the laboratory for impressions.

Test Unit 1 (98.83–98.38 m Elevation [174–219 cm bs])
Test Unit 1 was excavated in the southeast quadrant adjacent to Trench 8, outside the boundaries
of site 41BT427. This test unit and trench served primarily to prospect for cultural materials on
the opposite side of the road from the originally defined boundary for site 41BT427. Test Unit 1
was excavated to test a charcoal concentration observed at approximately 185 cm bs (elevation
98.72 m), the recorded depth for the lower component originally recorded at site 41BT427. To
determine if this material was cultural in origin, 1-x-1-m Test Unit 1 was placed adjacent to the
trench. Several small fragments of possibly burned rock and one smoothed chipped stone flake
were encountered at 200 cm bs (elevation 98.57 m) in a gravel lens (Table 15). It is unlikely that
this material represents in situ cultural activity.

Test Unit 2 was excavated at 41BT427 adjacent to Trench 11 to test an area along the north
trench profile that exposed a bivalve shell as well as a burned rock. Charcoal flecking was
observed in the trench wall and during hand excavation between 70 cm to 210 cm bs (99.57–
98.17 m) with a concentration near 210 cm bs (98.17 m), just above a sand layer. Only one
chipped stone flake was collected during excavation from Level 5 (99.27–99.17 m) (see Table
15).

Test Unit 3 (99.55–98.15 m Elevation [55–195 cm bs])
Test Unit 3 was excavated adjacent to Trench 12 at site 41BT427. Although no cultural material
was observed in the profiles of Trench 12, this area required testing to determine the presence of
cultural material that escaped notice or was simply not exposed in profile. During excavation
charcoal was observed throughout the profile. Large pieces were periodically collected as
samples, though unassociated with cultural material. A total of 15 chipped stone flakes was
recovered in this unit; three from Levels 1 and 2 (99.55–99.35 m), three from Level 5 (99.15–
99.05 m), and nine from Levels 8 and 9 (98.85–98.65 m) (see Table 15). One fragment of mussel
shell was collected from Level 5. One fragment of bone was collected from Level 7 (98.95–
98.85 m).

Test Unit 4 (99.36–98.26 m Elevation [75–185 cm bs])
Test Unit 4 at 41BT427 was excavated adjacent to Trench 10 over a cluster of three burned rocks
observed in the north profile at 80-85 cm bs (99.31–99.26 m). Feature 1 was identified in this
unit and consisted of a small cluster of burned, friable limestone, chipped stone flakes, and a
37

small amount of animal bone in Test Unit 4 along Trench 10 between 85 and 90 cm bs (99.26–
99.21 m) (Figure 19). Although one basal fragment of a biface was collected from Level 1, the
majority of cultural material was recovered from Level 2 (99.26–99.16 m) (Figure 20). This
included 56 chipped stone flakes (34 recovered from flotation) and seven bone fragments (see
Table 15).

The biface fragment was made from a gray, fine-grained chert with pale inclusions similar to
common Edwards chert varieties. The extant piece has a 27.5-mm maximum width, a 25-mm
maximum length, and a 6-mm maximum thickness.
Even though charcoal flecking was observed in the level containing Feature 1, only one larger
piece of charcoal could be collected. This charcoal was submitted for radiocarbon dating (Beta
236942) and produced a 2 sigma calibrated result of A.D. 650 to 780 (Cal BP 1300 to 1170)
(Appendix C). In addition, very small flecks of burned earth were observed throughout the soil
matrix.
Below the Feature 1 occupation zone, materials were scattered throughout the profile. One
chipped stone flake was recovered from Level 6 (98.86–98.76 m) (Figure 21; see Table 15).

Test Unit 5 (99.36–98.66 m Elevation [75–145 cm bs])
Test Unit 5 at 41BT427 was excavated adjacent to Trench 10 and on the east side of Test Unit 4.
This unit was opened up to test the apparent concentration in Levels 1 and 2 (99.36–99.16 m) that
was observed in Test Unit 4 and to test the location of an additional burned rock observed in the
trench profile. The density of artifacts recovered from the levels adjacent to Feature 1 was much
lower than observed in Test Unit 4. One chipped stone flake and one diagnostic tool were
recovered from Level 2 (99.26–99.16 m) in addition to one piece of shell and 2.5 g of burned clay
(see Table 15).
The only diagnostic artifact recovered during this investigation was found in this unit. The basal
portion of a medium-sized dart point was recovered from 88 cm bs (Level 2) in Test Unit 5
(Figure 22). The projectile point base is broken along a lateral edge and across the blade. This
point is barbed with a bifurcated base. The fracture removed one barb. The stem is straight and
the base is thinned but does not appear to be ground. This tool was made from a gray to tan chert
with inclusions that appear common in many varieties of Edwards chert. The stem width is
18 mm, total extant length is 30 mm, and stem length is 13 mm; projected maximum width would
be 31 mm if this point was roughly symmetrical prior to breakage.

Test Unit 6 (99.49–98.18 m Elevation [76–210 cm bs])
Test Unit 6 was excavated adjacent to Trench 13 to test two large burned rocks that were exposed
in the north trench wall at approximately 90 cm bs (99.38 m). Again, one clear occupation zone
was recorded. A cluster of burned and unburned rock was recorded and photographed in Level 4
(Figure 23). A total of 108 pieces of chipped stone debitage were collected from Levels 3 and 4
(99.28–99.08 m), with 105 coming from Level 4 (99.18–99.08 m) alone (51 were from flotation
samples). In addition, 34 g of burned clay were collected from Level 4, 49 fragments of animal
bone were recovered from Level 4 and 3 fragments from Level 3 (99.28–99.18 m) (see Table 15).
Charcoal from Level 4 was collected and submitted for radiocarbon dating (Beta 236943) and
resulted in a 2 sigma calibrated age of A.D. 660 to 780 (Cal BP 1290 to 1160) (Appendix C).
Below this occupation zone, artifact recovery was sparse (Figure 24). One flake each was
recovered from Levels 6 (98.98–98.88 m) and 9 (98.68–98.58 m), and three bone fragments were
recovered from Level 12 (98.38–98.28 m) (see Table 15).
Test Unit 7 (99.49–98.58 m Elevation [77–170 cm bs])
Test Unit 7 was one of three test units placed adjacent to Trench 13 and west of Test Unit 6 to
further explore the occupation zone that was recorded in Level 4 of TU 6 (99.18–99.08 m).
Several large rocks were exposed in Levels 3 and 4 (99.28–99.08 m) and 11 chipped stone flakes
and 2.6 g of burned clay were collected from Level 4 (Figure 25). Below the Level 4 occupation
zone, one flake each was recovered from Level 7 (98.88–98.78 m) and Level 8 (98.78–98.68 m),
and 10.5 g of burned clay were collected from Level 7.

Test Unit 8 (99.53–98.63 m Elevation [75–165 cm bs])
Test Unit 8 was excavated just west of Test Unit 7 to further expose the occupation zone at
approximately 99.18–99.08 m. Recovery was much lower in this unit than in Test Units 6 and 7.
No chipped stone was recovered in the upper five levels of Test Unit 8. However, 40.0 g of
burned clay were collected from Levels 3, 4, and 5 (99.33–99.03 m), and one bone fragment was
recovered in Level 5 (99.13–99.03 m). Three chipped stone flakes and 6.1 g of burned clay were
recovered from Levels 6 and 7 (99.03–98.83 m). The artifact density recorded for Test Unit 8 is
very low and does not reflect the density observed elsewhere on site in association with the thin
occupation zone.

Test Unit 9 (99.53–98.73 m Elevation [75–155 cm bs])
Test Unit 9 was excavated just west of Test Unit 8 along the north wall of Trench 13. Six
chipped stone flakes were recovered in this unit: three in Level 4 (99.23–99.13 m), one in Level 6
(99.03–98.93 m), and two in Level 7 (98.93–98.83 m). In addition, 22.1 g of burned clay were
collected from Levels 5 and 6 (99.13–99.03 m). Similar to Test Unit 8, the artifact density is
much lower than it was in units excavated further to the east. The occupation zone recorded
elsewhere on site is not reflected by cultural material distribution in this unit.

Summary of Excavations
The excavation of four mechanical trenches and eight hand-excavated units (8.94 cubic m) at site
41BT427 resulted in the identification of only one definable cultural component. This occupation
zone appears to lie on a natural surface that slopes down toward North Rocky Creek to the west.
The material expression of this occupation was most abundant and apparent in Test Unit 4, Level
2, Feature 1 (99.26–99.16 m), as well as in Test Unit 6, Level 4 (99.18–99.08 m). This indicates
only an 8-cm slope of this surface over a distance of approximately 36 m. Charcoal samples from
both of these levels were submitted for radiocarbon dating (Beta 236942 and 236943) and
produced 2 sigma calibrated results of A.D. 650 to 780 (Cal BP 1300 to 1170) and A.D. 660 to 780
(Cal BP 1290 to 1160). Both AMS dates are consistent with the transitional Late Archaic to Late
Prehistoric period in Central Texas. No diagnostic cultural material was collected from the test
unit or backhoe trench excavations. It appears that site 41BT427 represents an ephemeral, shortterm campsite used by hunter-gatherers, perhaps during a brief foray for resource exploitation
along North Rocky Creek.

LABORATORY ANALYSES
The following describes the analyses of all artifacts recovered from the testing of 41BT427.
Table 15 quantifies the materials (lithics, shell, vegetal sample, burned clay, bone, and firecracked rock) from each of the test units by depth. Detailed discussions of the individual artifact
classes follow below.

Faunal Remains
The recovered faunal remains from 41BT427 totaled 50 unworked fragments with 39
unidentified. The identified fragments included three specimens of Small Terrestrial Mammal,
one specimen of Medium Terrestrial Mammal, one specimen each of Large Terrestrial Mammal
and Canis sp., three molluscan specimens, and two unidentifiable specimens of fish (Table 16).
Overall, the faunal sample from site 41BT427 was small, poorly preserved and provides little
information concerning prehistoric subsistence patterns.

Botanical Remains
Macrobotanical remains recovered by flotation are given in Tables 17 and 18 by count and

Carbonized Plant Remains

Wood Charcoal
A total of 80 fragments weighing 1.48 g was recovered and 47 fragments were identified (see
Table 17). Eleven wood fragments (23 percent) were too small or in too poor condition to be
identified more specifically than as a hardwood. Interestingly, oaks make up only 23 percent of
the assemblage. Even if all indeterminable fragments were oak, it would still make up less than
half the assemblage. Oak typically comprises 60–80 percent of the wood charcoal in burned rock
features in Central Texas (Bush 2009, 2010; Mehalchick et al. 2004). Most likely, inhabitants
at41BT427 were collecting wood for fuel from the riparian environment in the immediate site
area, where pecan, elm, ash, sycamore, and willow or cottonwood are more common than oaks,
which dominate the uplands. Although pecan burns nearly as hot as oak and makes good coals,
the other woods recovered are of considerably lower quality as firewood. Juniper is absent from
the archeological assemblage, both because it is a relatively poor fuelwood and because it would
have been restricted to ravines and limestone outcrops in pre-agricultural times (Fonteyn et al.
1988:88).

Nutshell
Six fragments of pecan nutshell were recovered from FS#62. Pecan nutshell is unlikely to have
been carbonized incidental to the burning of pecan wood, since pecan nuts do not cling to the tree
branches as the hulls do. Rather, it represents a probable ancient food resource for inhabitants of
the site. Grant Hall (2000:109–110) points out that the fat in pecan nuts may have been critical to
hunter-gatherers who relied on lean meat for a portion of the year. Nutritional data for pecans are
given in Table 20.

Seeds
Two seeds were recovered from Test Unit 6. One seed is approximately one-third complete and
cannot be identified. The other seed is saucer-shaped, 1.5 mm in diameter, sparsely papillate in
texture, with a triangular hilum nearly identical to that of pokeweed (Phytolacca americana). An
identification of coralito (Rivina humilis) is suggested. Coralito, also called pigeon-berry or
rougeplant, is a more delicate relative of pokeweed that grows in woodlands near streams. It has
smaller seeds than pokeweed. The seed texture is described as hairy (Diggs et al. 1999:882),
whereas pokeweed seeds are smooth. Both pokeweed and coralito are considered toxic, but their
berries make excellent red dyes (Correll and Johnston 1970; Tull 1987).

Macroflora from site 41BT427 show selection of wood in the immediate vicinity of the site for
fuel despite the relatively low fuel value of some of those taxa. Test Unit 6 also yielded pecan
nutshells, indicating exploitation of nut resources that may have provided valuable dietary fat.

Uncarbonized Plant Remains
Most uncarbonized plant remains at 41BT427 appear in the form of rootlets that are clearly
modern and not reported here. In addition, five types of uncarbonized seeds were recovered in
flotation (see Table 19). Uncarbonized seeds are a common occurrence on most archeological
sites, but they usually represent seeds of modern plants that have made their way into the soil
either through their own dispersal mechanisms or by faunalturbation, floralturbation, or
argilliturbation (Bryant 1985:51–52; Keepax 1977; Miksicek 1987:231–232). In all except the
driest areas of North America, uncarbonized plant material on open-air sites can be assumed to be
of modern origin unless compelling evidence suggests otherwise (Lopinot and Brussell 1982;
Miksicek 1987:231). Although site 41BT427 has offered no such evidence and the seeds are
interpreted as modern seed rain, one taxon—hackberry—however, merits further discussion.
Unlike the other uncarbonized seeds from site 41BT427, hackberry seeds are known to persist for
many centuries in the soil. Hackberry’s high resistance to decay presents particular interpretive
difficulties on archeological sites. What archeologists typically recover is the hackberry
endocarp, the thick white seedcoat from under the under thin fleshy layer of the fruit. The
endocarp has a high mineral content: It contains 40–70 percent aragonite, a crystalline form of
calcium carbonate (Wang et al. 1997; Yanovsky et al. 1932). The carbonate helps hackberry
endocarps preserve unusually well in the soil, and it makes hackberry endocarps excellent
candidates for dating of the geological sediments in which they originated. Yang Wang and
colleagues argue that dating of sediments by hackberry inclusions is preferable to other methods.
Since the carbonates form over a single growing season, their initial 14C content is the same as
that in the atmosphere, and they can be tested for reliability before dating (Wang et al. 1997:342).
Hackberry endocarps are surprisingly common in geological and archeological strata (Wang et al.
1997:337), but they are not necessarily archeological in origin. The difficulty for archeobotanists
is determining whether the hackberry endocarps represent the traces of human hackberry use or
merely the presence of hackberries at the site location (or the location at which the site sediments
originated).
48

The single, whole hackberry seed from FS#65 at 41BT427 is white in color and therefore has not
been exposed to the cultural agent of fire as the demonstrably ancient plants have. Most likely, it
represents recent seed rain. Hackberry fruits are a candidate for ancient plant exploitation at
41BT427, however, because they were likely present near the confluence of North Rocky Creek
and South Rocky Creek in prehistoric times and were widely used by historic people (Moerman
1998). Nonetheless, the particular hackberry observed in the samples probably does not represent
the archeological traces of this activity.

Chipped Stone Tools and Debitage
The lithic assemblage from site 41BT427 consists of one biface fragment and a dart projectile
point fragment (see discussions for Test Units 4 and 5, respectively). The 103 pieces of debitage
(102 reduction flakes and one piece of shatter) are of various sizes and were quantified by size,
raw materials, and heated/not heated categories (Table 21).

The majority of the lithic debitage was 19 mm or smaller with just less than a third of the total
assemblage being larger. Among the the debitage, the majority was made from chert (42 percent
from undifferentiated chert, 33 percent from fine-grained Edwards chert), 20 percent from
quartzite, and a negligible 0.02 percent from limestone. The majority of the assemblage (60
percent) showed some indication (discolored, fractured, or potlidded) of having been affected by
fire to some degree.

Baked Clay
Irregular masses of fire-hardened clay were collected during the excavation and returned to the
lab for basic quantification (Table 22). The total number of baked clay masses only totaled 22
and all were relatively small at less than 19 mm. Among the collection, only one specimen was
found to be impressed daub (Test Unit 8, 125–135 cm bs), with the others showing no indication
of impressions. The baked clay specimens were found in Test Units 5, 8, and 9 (85–135 cm bs),
as well as from the soil samples taken from Test Units 6 and 7 (100–122 cm bs).

All baked clay specimens were fired in a low temperature environment as evidence of color
change was minimal. With the exception of the impressed specimen, all other examples of baked
clay were eroded with sub-rounded edges, suggesting some level of disturbance since their
original firing. The impressed specimen has two horizontal impressions, each approximately 1
mm in width, consistent with various small grass taxa. It is unlikely the impressed baked clay
specimen represents daub but rather an incidental grass impression within a clay ground surface.

Fire-Cracked Rock
Fire-cracked rock (FCR) collected from the testing was first analyzed for material type and then
sorted by size. FCR was the most represented artifact class with a total of 348 fragments, ranging
in size from less than 6.4 mm to over 50 mm (Table 23). The majority of the FCR assemblage
from site 41BT427 was limestone (n=323, 93 percent); the remaining 15 specimens were of
quartzite (n=7), steatite (n=6), and undifferentiated chert (n=2). Test Units 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9
all yielded FCR (n=298). The soil samples from Test Units 5, 7, and 9 additionally produced 50
of the of FCR specimens.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The test excavation of 41BT427 was designed to collect sufficient data for the evaluation of the
eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL as well as its continued
research potential. This chapter presents a summary of investigations and recommendations.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

National Register of Historic Places
Archeological sites are evaluated according to criteria based on federal regulations for
determining the significance of cultural resources for inclusion in the NRHP. Determinations of
eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are applied following the identification of the following
criteria, relevant historical themes, and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
(A) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
(B) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(C) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinction; or
(D) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history[36
CFR § 60.4].

Usually, Criterion D is applied to most prehistoric and many historic sites. Important information
is generally recognized to as referring to scientific importance. This importance is, of course,
driven by such factors as current research perspectives and the state of available information
regarding a particular research topic in a specific research area. Over time, data requirements for
some research questions may be addressed to various degrees, even though complementary data
are often needed from different temporal periods, geographic settings, or site types to fully
51

understand the diversity of past human activities. If data approach redundancy, the need for
corroborative information from similar sites is diminished. This suggests that information
deemed important are tied to both a specific geographical area, reflecting a cultural adaptation or
region, and a state of accumulated knowledge regarding a research domain. Archeological sites
with integrity containing artifacts and features that can contribute information toward addressing
research issues are regarded as significant and are eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
In many cases, and for various reasons of preservation, site formation processes, or postdepositional disturbances, some archeological remains are generally regarded as having very little
or no research potential for contributing useful information toward the understanding of history or
prehistory. For instance, an artifact assemblage might be disturbed from its primary context, or
components of various temporal periods might be mixed or otherwise not interpretable. In such
cases, a site is not regarded as scientifically important, and in general, these kinds of sites are not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

State Archeological Landmark
At the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
1. The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
2. The archeological site is situated on private land which has been specifically designated as an SAL
. . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site’s original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter 41.7,
Antiquities Code of Texas].

SUMMARY
During the current project by Geo-Marine, the bridge replacement area was investigated via
backhoe trenches and test units. Thirteen trenches were dug within the project area: nine survey
trenches in the northwest, southwest, and southeast quadrants outside the known boundary of site
41BT427, and four trenches within the site itself in the northeast quadrant. The current
investigation within site 41BT427 involved the mechanical excavation of the four trenches (29.5
linear meters) and the hand excavation of eight test units (8.94 cubic meters) within the site
boundary (an additional test unit was excavated south of the site boundary). Only one definable
cultural component (Feature 1) was identified at site 41BT427. The single feature identified
consisted of a very small, disarticulated cluster of six burned rocks and included 56 chipped stone
flakes and seven bone fragments. No diagnostic material was recovered during excavation.
52

Backhoe trenching in the northwest, southwest, and southeast quadrants outside the known
boundary of site 41BT427 did not reveal any cultural material. Test excavations within site
41BT427 provided sparse data concerning Central Texas prehistoric subsistence, seasonality,
chronology and site specific activities. Limited faunal and botanical evidence suggest site
inhabitants were targeting terrestrial food sources such as deer and pecan as well aquatic taxa like
mussels and fish. The riparian setting of 41BT427 was likely inhabited during the fall season
when deer and pecan would have been most plentiful but due to the paucity of data, site usage in
other seasons cannot be discounted. All lithic material recovered from test excavations appear to
be Edwards Plateau chert with no discernable evidence of imported chipped stone resources. The
AMS data from the site’s only feature (Feature 1) and associated strata both suggest the sites
primary usage dates to the transitional Late Archaic—Late Prehistoric period. No other definitive
culturally diagnostic material was recovered from the test excavations. Site activities such as tool
maintenance, animal carcass processing and cooking can be tentatively inferred from the
recovered lithic, faunal, and FCR evidence.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Testing (i.e. backhoe trenching and one test unit) outside of the site boundary for 41BT427 within
the northwest, southwest, and southeast quadrants of the project area failed to detect any cultural
material and no further work in these areas is recommended.
Although site 41BT427 does provide some very basic information concerning subsistence,
seasonality, mobility, chronology, and site-specific activities, the data as such do not appreciably
add to our understanding Central Texas prehistory. The sparse evidence provided by the lowdensity deposits of site 41BT427 indicates the site has little potential to add further to our
understanding of Central Texas prehistory. Thus, site 41BT427 fails to meet the standards of
Criterion D or any other significant standard for assessing NRHP or SAL eligibility. Site
41BT427 is recommended as not eligible for NRHP inclusion or for designation as an SAL. No
historic properties as defined under 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(6), 13 TAC 26.5(32), and 13 TAC
26.8 were identified during the archeological investigation of the current project APE. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2) and 13 TAC 26.2, no further investigation is necessary at
site 41BT427.

Four flotation samples from Site 41BT427 were submitted for identification and analysis
of botanical macroremains. The flotation samples represent three features and non-feature fill for
a total of twenty cubic deciliters of soil matrix. The site is situated in northwestern Burnet County
on a low terrace of North Rocky Creek approximately 500 meters above its confluence with
South Rocky Creek.

Site setting
Site 41BT427 lies in the Lampassas cut plain, a vegetation area grouped variously with
the Edwards Plateau (Riskind and Diamond 1988) or the Cross Timbers (Diggs et al. 1999; Gould
1962). A mosaic of grasslands and woodlands characterizes the vegetation. Grasslands are mixed
prairie, with tall, medium and short grasses present. Upland trees and shrubs typically grow in
mottes of oaks, juniper, and agarito. Yaupon and deciduous holly, elbowbush, persimmon, and
sumac are common small trees and shrubs. Moister areas along streams and mesic slopes support
trees such as sycamore, pecan, hackberry and elm (Beaty 1978; Riskind and Diamond 1988).
Site 41BT427 is at the southeastern edge of the Paluxy formation (Mehalchick et al.
2004:Figure 1.1), a geological formation associated with archaeological indications of geophyte
processing. Soils at 41BT427, however, are generally alluvial in origin rather than outcroppings
of Paluxy sands (THC site form, 7/10/2007). Excavators describe site soils as silty or sandy clay
loam. According to survey maps, soil associations in the site area are Oakalla silty clay loams
(Soil Survey Staff 2010).

Methods
Flotation samples were processed at Geo-Marine Inc’s Plano offices in a Siraf tank
flotation system with bottom mesh openings of 0.5 mm (Pearsall 2000:Figure 2.21). Flotation and
carbon samples were sent to Macrobotanical Analysis in February 2010.
Flotation samples were sorted according to standard procedures (Pearsall 2000). Each
sample was weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200 x 0.01 g electronic balance before being sizesorted through a stack of graduated geologic mesh. Materials that did not pass through the No. 10
mesh (2 mm square openings) were completely sorted. At 41BT427, only three categories were
present larger than 2 mm: carbonized macrobotanical remains, identifiable bones, and
contamination. The “contamination” category includes uncarbonized botanical remains such as
rootlets and hackberry seeds, gastropod and bivalve shells, soil clumps, and rocks. All carbonized
botanical remains and identifiable bones were counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled.
Contamination was weighted, recorded, and labeled only. Materials that fell through the 2 mm
mesh (“residue”) were examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 7-45 X magnification for
carbonized botanical remains. Identifiable material was removed from residue, counted, weighed,
recorded, and labeled. Although wood charcoal smaller than 2 mm is not usually removed from
residue, so little wood charcoal was present in three of the samples that wood charcoal greater
than 0.7 mm was removed from FS#60 and FS#61 and wood charcoal greater than 1.4 mm was
removed from FS#65. Uncarbonized macrobotanical remains were recorded on a
presence/absence basis on laboratory forms.

B-5

For each flotation sample, wood charcoal fragments were selected at random for
identification. Fragments were snapped to reveal a clean transverse section and examined under a
stereoscopic microscope at 28-180 X magnification. When necessary, tangential or radial sections
were examined for ray seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and sizes of intervessel
pitting, and other minute characteristics that can only be seen at the higher magnifications of this
range.
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison
to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of
standard reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; Martin and Barkley
1961; Musil 1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980). Plant nomenclature follows that of the PLANTS
Database (USDA, NRCS 2010).

Macrobotanical remains recovered by flotation are given in Tables B-1 and B-2 by count

Uncarbonized plant remains
Most uncarbonized plant remains at 41BT427 appear in the form of rootlets that are
clearly modern and not reported here. In addition, five types of uncarbonized seeds were
recovered in flotation (see Table B-3). Uncarbonized seeds are a common occurrence on most
archaeological sites, but they usually represent seeds of modern plants that have made their way
into the soil either through their own dispersal mechanisms or by faunalturbation, floralturbation,
or argilliturbation (Bryant 1985:51-52; Keepax 1977; Miksicek 1987:231-232). In all except the
driest areas of North America, uncarbonized plant material on open-air sites can be assumed to be
of modern origin unless compelling evidence suggests otherwise (Lopinot and Brussell 1982;
Miksicek 1987:231). Site 41BT427 has offered no such evidence, and the seeds are interpreted as
modern seed rain. One taxon, however, merits further discussion.
The hackberry problem. Unlike the other uncarbonized seeds from site 41BT427,
hackberry seeds are known to persist for many centuries in the soil. Hackberry’s high resistance
to decay presents particular interpretive difficulties on archaeological sites. What archaeologists
typically recover is the hackberry endocarp, the thick white seedcoat from under the under thin
fleshy layer of the fruit. The endocarp has a high mineral content: It contains 40-70 percent
aragonite, a crystalline form of calcium carbonate (Wang et al. 1997; Yanovsky et al. 1932). The
carbonate helps hackberry endocarps preserve unusually well in the soil, and it makes hackberry
endocarps excellent candidates for dating of the geological sediments in which they originated.
Yang Wang and colleagues argue that dating of sediments by hackberry inclusions is preferable
to other methods. Since the carbonates form over a single growing season, their initial 14C content
is the same as that in the atmosphere, and they can be tested for reliability before dating (Wang et
al. 1997:342). Hackberry endocarps are surprisingly common in geological and archaeological
strata (Wang et al. 1997:337) – but they are not necessarily archaeological in origin. The
difficulty for archaeobotanists is determining whether the hackberry endocarps represent the
traces of human hackberry use or merely the presence of hackberries at the site location (or the
location at which the site sediments originated).
The single, whole hackberry seed from FS#65 at 41BT427 is white in color and therefore
has not been exposed to the cultural agent of fire as the demonstrably ancient plants have. Most
likely, it represents recent seed rain. Hackberry fruits are a candidate for ancient plant
exploitation at 41BT427, however, because they were likely present near the confluence of North
Rocky Creek and South Rocky Creek in prehistoric times and were widely used by historic
people (Moerman 1998). The particular hackberry observed in the samples, however, probably
does not represent the archaeological traces of this activity. Further discussion of the plant
remains from 41BT427 concerns carbonized plants only.

Carbonized plant remains
Wood charcoal. A total of 80 fragments weighing 1.48 g were recovered and 47
fragments were identified (Figure B-1). Eleven wood fragments (23%) were too small or in too
poor condition to be identified more specifically than as a hardwood. Interestingly, oaks make up
only 23% of the assemblage. Even if all indeterminable fragments were oak, it would still make
up less than half the assemblage. Oak typically comprises 60-80 percent of the wood charcoal in
burned rock features in central Texas (Mehalchick et al. 2004; Bush 2009; Bush 2010). Most
likely, inhabitants at 41BT427 were collecting wood for fuel from the riparian environment in the
immediate site area, where pecan, elm, ash, sycamore, and willow or cottonwood are more
common than oaks, which dominate the uplands. Although pecan burns nearly as hot as oak and
B-8

makes good coals, the other woods recovered are of considerably lower quality as firewood.
Juniper is absent from the archaeological assemblage, both because it is a relatively poor
fuelwood and because it would have been restricted to ravines and limestone outcrops in preagricultural times (Fonteyn et al. 1988:88).
Nutshell. Six fragments of pecan nutshell were recovered from FS#62. Pecan nutshell is
unlikely to have been carbonized incidental to the burning of pecan wood, since pecan nuts do not
cling to the tree branches as the hulls do. Rather, it represents a probable ancient food resource
for inhabitants of the site. Grant Hall points out that the fat in pecan nuts may have been critical
to hunter-gatherers who relied on lean meat for a portion of the year (Hall 2000:109-110).
Nutritional data for pecans are given in Table B-4.
Seeds. Two seeds were recovered from Feature 6, one of the three hearths. One seed is
approximately one-third complete and cannot be identified. The other seed is saucer shaped, 1.5
mm in diameter, sparsely papillate in texture, with a triangular hilum nearly identical to that of
pokeweed (Phytolacca americana). An identification of coralito (Rivina humilis) is suggested.
Coralito, also called pigeon-berry or rougeplant, is a more delicate relative of pokeweed that
grows in woodlands near streams. It has smaller seeds than pokeweed. The seed texture is
described as hairy (Diggs et al. 1999:882), whereas pokeweed seeds are smooth. Both pokeweed
and coralito are considered toxic, but their berries make excellent red dyes (Correll and Johnston
1970; Tull 1987).

Summary
Macroflora from Site 41BT427 show selection of wood in the immediate vicinity of the
site for fuel despite the relatively low fuel value of some of those taxa. Feature 6 yielded pecan
nutshells, indicating exploitation of nut resources that may have provided valuable dietary fat.
The three samples from feature (hearth) contexts contained a higher density of carbonized
botanical material than did the non-feature sample (FS#61).
