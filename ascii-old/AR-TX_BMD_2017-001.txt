Abstract

ABSTRACT
Breviloba, LLC, contracted Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. (Burns & McDonnell) to
perform a cultural resource survey for the Shin Oak Pipeline Project (Project) that involves construction
of a 24-inch natural gas liquids pipeline extending across central Texas from Midland to Mont Belvieu.
One segment of the Project crosses land owned by the State of Texas at the Alfred D. Hughes Unit near
Gatesville in Coryell County. This land is administered by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and
therefore the Antiquities Code of Texas applies to this segment of the Project. The survey and report are
being completed under Texas Historical Commission Antiquities Permit No. 8171. The following report
provides information regarding the Hughes Unit segment of the Project and includes the methods and
results of the cultural resource background review and archaeological survey of the 33.7-acre Area of
Potential Effects (APE). No archaeological sites or other cultural resources were found in the APE. No
impacts to cultural resources are anticipated within this segment of the Project, and no further cultural
resource work is recommended there.

Introduction

INTRODUCTION

Breviloba, LLC (Breviloba) contracted Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. (Burns &
McDonnell) to perform a cultural resource survey for the Shin Oak Pipeline Project (Project) that
involves construction of a 24-inch natural gas liquids pipeline extending across central Texas from
Midland to Mont Belvieu. One segment of the Project crosses land at the Alfred D. Hughes Unit (Survey
Area) near Gatesville in Coryell County. This report provides information regarding the 33.7-acre Survey
Area and includes the methods and results of the cultural resource background review and archaeological
survey. No archaeological sites or other cultural resources were found in the Survey Area. No impacts to
cultural resources are anticipated within this segment of the Project, and no further cultural resource work
is recommended there.

1.1

Project Background and Permitting Requirements

Breviloba is planning to construct a 24-inch natural gas liquids pipeline across central Texas (Appendix
A: Figure A-1). The Survey Area crosses land owned by the State of Texas and administered by the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice. The strictures of the Antiquities Code of Texas apply to this segment of
the Project, and the survey was completed in accordance with Texas Historical Commission Antiquities
Permit No. 8171. These permitting tie-ins require a cultural resource investigation prior to construction, to
identify any significant historic properties and make a preliminary assessment of Project impacts to any
such properties. Because this small survey discovered no cultural resources, a short reporting format, as
recommended in the Council of Texas Archaeologists Guidelines, is used here.

1.2

Area of Potential Effects

The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for archaeological and non-archaeological cultural resources extends
300 feet northward onto state land at the Hughes Unit. Because the Project crosses 4,900 feet of state
land, the lateral APE covers approximately 33.7 acres. The vertical depth of the APE is the proposed
depth of the pipeline trench: approximately 6 feet. No separate APE for access roads is considered within
the Hughes Unit segment because all related access routes will be contained entirely within the 33.7-acre
APE.

1.3

Project History and Personnel

Burns & McDonnell archaeologists conducted a background review of the APE prior to the
commencement of fieldwork. That review covered the APE and land within a 1-mile radius of the APE.
An archaeological survey of the APE took place on October 17, 2017. The survey was performed by Dale
Norton and Paige Munz. Mr. Norton served as Principal Investigator.

Research Design

RESEARCH DESIGN

The objective of this survey was to locate and assess significant historic properties within the APE.
Historic properties include archaeological sites, buildings, structures, etc. that are 50 years of age or older.
Significance is assessed in terms of eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). This chapter reviews the archival sources that were consulted, as well as the methods used
during the cultural resource survey.

2.1

Archival Review Methods

A Burns & McDonnell archaeologist performed an initial desktop archival review to identify previously
recorded archaeological sites and other previously identified historic properties or historic-period
resources within the APE and a 1-mile radius around it (Study Area). This review included an
examination of the online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA). The TASA was also examined to
identify previous cultural resource surveys completed in the Study Area. The archival review also
involved an examination of the list of Official State of Texas Historical Markers. That list includes
Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks, NRHP-listed sites and districts, and historic-age cemeteries.
Additional online sources were also consulted. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Historic Topographic
Map Explorer, which contains images of old topographic quadrangle maps, was researched. The Web Soil
Survey website of the Natural Resources Conservation Service was examined to obtain soils data for the
Survey Area. Old air photo imagery covering the Survey Area was examined at the Historicaerials.com
website and through Google Earth.

2.2

Cultural Resource Survey Methods

Burns & McDonnell conducted field work according to accepted archaeological survey standards. These
standards are agreed upon by the Texas Historical Commission and the Council of Texas Archeologists.
The standards conform to the Secretary of Interior’s “Standards and Guidelines for Identification and
Evaluation Guidelines for Local Surveys” (National Register Bulletin Number 24).
Subsequent to a review of geology, soils, topographic maps, and previous investigations, it was
determined that the Survey Area was located in an erosional upland landscape with no significant
Holocene sediment deposition and variable ground surface visibility. Burns & McDonnell performed an
intensive survey involving a combination of pedestrian survey and shovel testing. Shovel testing was
undertaken in locations with relative dense vegetation cover. Paired shovel tests were placed at distances
of 75 to 115 meters (m) along parallel transects that were spaced 50 m apart. Backdirt from shovel tests

was screened through quarter-inch mesh. All shovel tests were backfilled after inspection and recording.
Shovel test locations were recorded with Global Positioning System equipment. Parts of the Survey Area
with good ground surface visibility were covered using standard pedestrian survey. Pedestrian survey
transects were spaced approximately 20 m apart. No artifacts were collected. Project records and
photographs generated under the Antiquities Permit will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory.

Results of the Background Review

RESULTS OF THE BACKGROUND REVIEW

This background review covers four topic areas. Soils, landforms, and land use within the Survey Area
are briefly described. Previously completed cultural resource survey within the Study Area are reviewed.
Previously recorded archaeological sites in the Study Area are also discussed. Lastly, non-archaeological
cultural resources known within the Study Area are reviewed.

3.1

Soils, Landforms, and Land Use

Four soil types are mapped for the Survey Area. Doss-Real complex soils occur on 1 to 8 percent slopes
in less than 1 percent of the area, all in the bottom of a draw near the west end of the Survey Area. This
soil type typically consists of 18 inches of clay loam A and Bk horizons resting on bedrock. Soils of the
Real-Rock outcrop complex occur on the steeply pitched, eroded walls of drainages in the center and west
end of the Survey Area, covering slightly less than one-quarter of the area. These soils are present on
slopes of 12 to 40 percent and typically consist of 17 inches on gravelly to very gravelly clay loam H
horizon resting above bedrock. Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex soils occur across one-third of the area, on
1 to 8 percent slopes. These soils typically consist of 9 inches of very cobbly to extremely cobbly clay A
horizon above bedrock. Eckrant very cobbly silty clay soils occur on 1 to 5 percent slopes across about 43
percent of the Survey Area. These soils occur on interfluves and they typically consist of 15 inches of
very cobbly silty clay A horizon resting on bedrock. All of these soil types are residual, having formed
from in situ weathering of bedrock.
The Survey Area is located in an upland landscape at the upper reaches of two eroded draws. Elevations
range between 980 and 1040 feet above mean sea level. Vertical relief is moderate, with relatively level
grades on the interfluves and steeper slopes on the valley walls. Bedrock exposures occur on valley walls
and on the shoulders of the interfluves. The two draws that drain the area to the south each contain
unnamed first-order intermittent tributaries of Stillhouse Branch, which itself is tributary to Leon River,
in the Little River system of the Brazos River watershed.
Historically, land use in the Survey Area appears to have been rangeland. Vegetation cover was not
mapped on the oldest available quadrangle map (USGS 1894), but it was mapped as scattered woodland
on maps dating from the mid-twentieth century (USGS 1947, 1957). By 1979, the area was mapped as
fully wooded, although a cleared utility corridor had been established sometime between 1957 and 1979
(USGS 1957, 1979). The Alfred D. Hughes Unit opened in 1990, and vegetation in the Survey Area
appears to have shifted to scattered woodland since that time (USGS 1994).

Results of the Background Review

Previous Cultural Resource Surveys

Two archaeological surveys have been previously reported in the Study Area. In 1988, a survey was
undertaken for All American Pipeline Company, along a proposed pipeline corridor that passed about
three-quarters of a mile north of the Survey Area. The pipeline was apparently not built along that
surveyed corridor, but three prehistoric sites were recorded in the vicinity as a result (see Section 3.3,
below). Data available from the TASA does not include the survey report title or authorship. In 2013,
archaeologists from Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. surveyed U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
jurisdictional areas along the BridgeTex North pipeline route (Brownlow et al. 2014). One of their survey
tracts was located about 0.8 mile east of the Survey Area, and another of their survey tracts was located
south of, and immediately adjacent to, the Survey Area. No cultural resources were reported from either
tract.

3.3

Previously Recorded Archaeological Sites

Based on a review of the TASA, four archaeological sites have been previously recorded in the Study
Area (Table 3-1; Appendix A: Figure A-2). Three are prehistoric lithic scatters; one of these may date to
the Archaic or Late Prehistoric Periods. The fourth is a prehistoric camp dating to the Archaic Period.
Sites 41CV296, 41CV297, and 41CV300 were recorded as part of the All American Pipeline survey in
1988. Site 41CV1462 appears to have been reported in relation to a project sponsored by the Texas Water
Development Board, although TASA records do not mention a survey report name or author. None of the
four sites have been formally evaluated for NRHP significance, but the three All American Pipeline sites
were each field-designated as not eligible for NRHP listing. All four sites contain either deflated or badly
disturbed soils. Two additional sites are shown on Figure A-2. These two sites (41CV299 and 41CV298)
are documented as prehistoric sites, but they fall outside of the Study Area.

Results of the Cultural Resource Survey

RESULTS OF THE CULTURAL RESOURCE SURVEY

Burns & McDonnell archaeologists conducted an intensive cultural survey of the Survey Area on October
17, 2017 (Appendix A: Figure A-3). The field crew found the Survey Area to be hilly uplands with
eroded bedrock exposed in many areas and small to medium cedar trees scattered throughout (see selected
field photographs, Appendix B). Somewhat more than half of the Survey Area was found to be covered in
dense, low buffalo grass with ground surface visibility of zero. That part of the Survey Area was surveyed
by means of shovel testing. The crew excavated 20 shovel tests in those areas. The rest of the area had
good ground surface visibility (greater than 30 percent) due to erosion and thin vegetation. That part of
the area was surveyed by means of pedestrian reconnaissance.
No evidence of cultural resources was found in the Survey Area. Shovel tests documented shallow, loamy
and clayey soils, some of which were very rocky (Appendix C). Bedrock was encountered at depths of
between 5 and 21 centimeters below ground surface.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The background review and cultural resource survey for the portion of the Shin Oak Pipeline Project that
passes through the Alfred D. Hughes Unit found no evidence for cultural resources. No artifacts or
cultural materials were identified, and the potential for deeply buried archaeological deposits is very low.
No further cultural resource work is recommended for the Survey Area.
In the event that previously unidentified cultural resources, such as archaeological sites, historic features,
or human remains are encountered during construction, it is recommended that Breviloba suspend all
construction activity and consult with a qualified archaeologist or osteologist. In addition, it is
recommended that Breviloba notify the Texas State Historic Preservation Office as required by law.
Should human skeletal remains be encountered during construction, all activities in the area are required
to cease immediately, pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code (Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 22, Rule 22.4
and Rule 22.5), Texas Health and Safety Code (Title 8, Subtitle C, Chapter 711), and Texas Penal Code
(Title 7, Chapter 28; Title 9, Chapter 42). In addition, local law enforcement must be notified and
treatment of any such discovery must proceed in accordance with Texas Administrative Code, Title 13,
Part 2, Chapter 26.
