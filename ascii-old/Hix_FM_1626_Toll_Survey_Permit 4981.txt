Abstract

ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted an intensive, 100-percent linear archeological survey of
approximately 3.3 miles of proposed expansions to Farm-to-Market (FM) 1626 west of the city of Buda,
Hays County, Texas. The survey was conducted between July 2008 and October 2016 for compliance
with the Antiquities Code of Texas and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act on behalf of
Hays County, the project engineer Klotz Associates, and the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT). The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for the proposed project is composed of 54.3 acres of
existing right of way and 8.08 acres of proposed expanded right of way (measuring 62.38 acres of
existing plus proposed expanded right of way), and approximately 1.07 acres of temporary construction
easements located outside of the existing or proposed right of way. While the proposed expanded right
of way corridor has been determined, the project engineer requested that a 200-foot-wide corridor be
investigated (extending 100 feet in either direction from the existing centerline) to allow for flexibility in
road design, potential utility relocation, and other possible areas of concern, resulting in a total of
approximately 81 acres of land surveyed. Investigations were coordinated with the Texas Historical
Commission through TxDOT under Texas Antiquities Committee Permit Number 4981.
On three occasions between July 28, 2008, and August 10, 2009 Hicks & Company archeologists
conducted an intensive linear archeological survey of the proposed FM 1626 improvements project west
of the city of Buda, Texas, on behalf of Hays County and TxDOT, returning to the field on January 21,
2016 to survey for proposed temporary construction easements located outside of the existing right of
way or proposed new right of way, and again on October 26, 2016 to survey proposed new right of way
in previously inaccessible parcels, completing the survey. The survey consisted of pedestrian inspection
supplemented by shovel testing (N=102) and mechanical backhoe trench excavations (N=7) in the area
north of Onion Creek. One backhoe trench excavated on the north bank of Onion Creek was positive for
two pieces of lithic debitage, along with 32 shovel tests throughout the APE that were positive for
cultural materials. One previously unrecorded site (Site 41HY449) was documented during the survey.
This prehistoric surficial scatter does not meet the significance criteria for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). In addition to this newly
recorded site, archeologists visited elements of seven previously recorded sites (Sites 41HY199-202,
41HY209-210, and 41HY219) within the APE. Elements of one of these, Site 41HY200, could not be found
within the archeological APE. Of these, only elements of Site 41HY201 are considered to have potential
to deem the site eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. The project engineer
has altered plans in the vicinity of the site to avoid impacts to those resources. All other sites were
found to be heavily disturbed, no longer extant, or within shallow surficial contexts atop bedrock with
limited research value.
Archeologists also visited the expansion areas adjacent to historic Barton Cemetery. Although the
cemetery lies in close proximity to the APE, the County proposes no expansions in the immediate vicinity
of the cemetery beyond a proposed retaining wall with riprap slope within the existing right of way
outside the cemetery. This retaining wall is to be constructed approximately ten feet within current
existing right of way. By design, retaining walls planned for this project will be fixed in place to concrete

leveling pads set in place on top of the current grade and supported by earth reinforcement buildup of
imported fill material. During survey, an overgrown road or trail that follows the current cemetery
fenceline reinforces the assumption that the existing cemetery boundary served as the historic
boundary as well, significantly reducing the potential for unmarked burials to be located within the
current archeological APE. Construction within the APE is recommended to proceed with no further
cultural resources investigation. The current investigations followed a no-collection policy. All projectrelated records, forms, and photographs will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

Management Summary

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted an intensive, 100-percent linear archeological survey of
approximately 3.3 miles of proposed expansions to Farm-to-Market (FM) 1626 from Ranch-to-Market
(RM) 967 to FM 2770 west of the city of Buda in Hays County, Texas (Appendix A: Exhibit 1). The survey
was conducted on behalf of Hays County, the project engineer Klotz Associates, and the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The survey was conducted in order to identify and evaluate the
horizontal and vertical extent of archeological deposits within the Area of Potential Effects (APE) for the
proposed project, which includes the existing right of way, the proposed new right of way, and
temporary construction easements. As the expansion will involve land owned by a political subdivision
of the State of Texas, the project falls under the oversight of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
Project alternatives are also being selected in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) through preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA), which requires fulfillment of Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800). All work was
coordinated with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
Permit Number 4981 and complied with the guidelines set by Section 106 and the Rules of Practice and
Procedure for implementing the ACT.
Requiring 139 hours, fieldwork occurred on three occasions between July 28, 2008, and August 10,
2009, on January 21, 2016 to survey for proposed temporary construction easements, and, finally, on
October 26, 2016 to survey proposed new right of way in previously inaccessible parcels. Initially,
Mason Miller served as Principal Investigator for the project and oversaw survey and the majority of
writing on the original draft report. In October of 2010, these duties were transferred to John Fulmer
and, later still, to Josh Haefner in June of 2012. Matthew Stotts served as Project Archeologist. Mason
Miller, Matthew Stotts, Brad Jones, John Campbell, Michael Chavez, Amy Goldstein, Gregg Cestaro, Will
Pratt, and Samantha Walden Champion conducted the survey. Kevin Contrino and Jerod McCleland are
credited for the Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping.
The survey consisted of pedestrian inspection supplemented by shovel testing (N=102) and mechanical
backhoe trench excavations (N=7) in the area north of Onion Creek. One backhoe trench excavated on
the north bank of Onion Creek was positive for two pieces of lithic debitage, along with 32 shovel tests
throughout the APE that were positive for cultural materials. One previously unrecorded site (Site
41HY449) was documented during the survey. This prehistoric surficial scatter does not meet the
significance criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as a State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL). Also, a total of seven previously recorded sites (Sites 41HY199–202, 41HY209–210, and
41HY219) were revisited during survey. Only elements of Site 41HY201 are considered to be potentially
eligible for listing on the NRHP or as an SAL; the project engineer has revised plans for the proposed
project to avoid impacts to this site. The areas surrounding historic Barton Cemetery were also
investigated. Based on the results of the investigations, it has been determined that the potential for
encountering unmarked burials within the site vicinity is low, especially considering that expansions are
not planned for the immediate vicinity of the cemetery beyond a proposed retaining wall with riprap
slope within the existing right of way of FM 1626. This retaining wall is to be constructed approximately

ten feet within current existing right of way. By design, retaining walls planned for this project will be
fixed in place to concrete leveling pads set in place on top of the current grade and supported by earth
reinforcement buildup of imported fill material (Appendix B: Typical Sections). Construction along the
remaining expansion corridor location is recommended to proceed with no further cultural resources
investigation as no historic properties will be affected.

Introduction and Project Description

INTRODUCTION AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION
From July 2008 to October 2016, archeologists from Hicks & Company conducted a 100-percent
intensive pedestrian survey of approximately 3.3 miles of proposed expansions to FM 1626 west of the
City of Buda, Hays County, Texas. The survey was conducted on behalf of Hays County, the project
engineer Klotz Associates, and TxDOT. The survey was conducted in order to identify and evaluate the
horizontal and vertical extent of archeological deposits within the APE for the proposed project, which
includes the below-described existing right of way, proposed new right of way, and temporary
construction easements. Any utility relocation that would be required for construction of the proposed
project is also considered part of the APE.
The proposed project would be located on both existing public right of way as well as land acquired from
private ownership and would consist of two 12-foot travel lanes with eight-foot shoulders (Appendix B).
The project construction plan consists of four 12-foot travel lanes (two in each direction), a 14-foot
center left turn lane, and two 10-foot shoulders along the outside, and approximately 1.07 acres of
temporary construction easements. In order to complete the proposed improvements, the County
plans to expand the existing 120-foot right of way to a variable width of 140 to 258 feet. Initially, this
equated to 11.24 acres of proposed new right of way added to the current 54.3 acres of existing right of
way. However, following the initial archeological survey, proposed right of way was reduced to a total of
8.08 acres. The proposed right of way generally straddles the existing right of way evenly with
occasional meanders. The roadway design engineer does not anticipate significant subsurface impacts
in roadway construction and estimate a maximum depth of impact of four feet for the roadway and
eight feet for the drainage. The engineer requested that archeologists follow a survey corridor 200 feet
wide (100 feet from the centerline and approximately 20 feet wider than the currently proposed
expanded right of way on each side) to allow for further design flexibility, utility shifting, and other
unforeseen concerns. Therefore, the total area surveyed measured approximately 81 acres including
the existing and proposed expanded rights of way, additional survey area, and temporary construction
easements. Since the expansion will involve land owned by a political subdivision of the State of Texas,
the project falls under the oversight of the ACT. Project alternatives are also being selected in
accordance with the NEPA through preparation of an EA, which requires fulfillment of Section 106 of the
NHPA of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800). All work was coordinated with the THC under TAC Permit
Number 4981 and complied with the guidelines set by Section 106 and the Rules of Practice and
Procedure for implementing the ACT (Appendix C). As part of TxDOT’s pass-through toll program, the
proposed project is initially sponsored through county funding with contributions from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA). Following construction, the roadway will be transferred to TxDOT,
which will pay the County back over time based upon use of the roadway.
Investigations involved a combination of pedestrian survey supplemented with shovel tests (N=102) and
backhoe trench excavations (N=7) to identify and evaluate the horizontal and vertical extent of
archeological deposits within the APE. Of these, one backhoe trench and 32 shovel tests tested positive
for cultural resources between the ground surface and 180 centimeters below the ground surface.

Introduction and Project Description

However, nearly all of the artifacts were found on upland landforms in shallow soils extending no
deeper than 40 centimeters.
Archival research was conducted using the THC Online Archeological Sites Atlas and available records at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). A total of seven archeological sites (41HY199-202,
41HY209-210, and 41HY219) and one historic cemetery (Barton Cemetery) were previously identified
within one kilometer of the APE prior to the current investigation. No Official State Historical Markers
(OSHMs), SALs, or sites listed in the NRHP have been recorded within the APE; however, two sites
(41HY202 and 41HY209) that are likely to be impacted by the proposed project are listed as eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. Both of these sites were extensively tested and mitigated in 1989 (Ricklis and
Collins 1994). Pursuant to the stipulations of 36 CFR 60 and 13 TAC 26, none of the segments of these
sites located within the APE are considered to contain elements that would indicate eligibility for listing
on the NRHP or as an SAL.
Sites 41HY199, 41HY210, 41HY219, and 41HY449 are small, disturbed surficial (or very shallowly buried)
prehistoric and/or historic scatters within the APE that lack significant components such as temporal
diagnostics, intact features, or evidence of potential organic preservation. Pursuant to the stipulations
of 36 CFR 60 and 13 TAC 26, none of these sites is considered to contain elements that would indicate
eligibility for listing on the NRHP or as an SAL.
The mapped location of Site 41HY200 was revisited and thoroughly investigated, though no cultural
materials were found within the recorded site area. Site 41HY202, considered significant during the
initial cultural resource survey of FM 1626 in the early 1990s and subject to testing and data recovery
excavations (Ricklis and Collins 1994), was found to be severely disturbed by repeated mining activities
within the current APE. Remnants of the site were very small (less than 700 square meters) and
consisted of a sparse surficial lithic debitage scatter and a single, likely disturbed burned rock feature.
Due to the extent of modern disturbance and limited potential for additional, intact deposits to be
located within the APE, the components of Site 41HY202 investigated during the current investigation
do not contribute to its NRHP/SAL eligibility status; therefore, no further work is recommended at the
site. Site 41HY201 contained prehistoric site elements that could contribute to its NRHP/SAL eligibility;
however, the project engineer has elected to prevent impacts to the site by avoiding the need for
expanded right of way in this area through construction of a retaining wall within the existing right of
way only. This retaining wall is to be constructed approximately ten feet within current existing right of
way. By design, retaining walls planned for this project will be fixed in place to concrete leveling pads
set in place on top of the current grade and supported by earth reinforcement buildup of imported fill
material (Appendix B: Typical Sections). Construction in this area will not require excavation of the
existing ground surface. Site 41HY209 is the remains of a prehistoric open campsite. Much of this site
within the current project APE has been heavily disturbed by construction associated with FM 1626 and
buried utilities along both sides of the roadway. Based on the exposed bedrock and lack of soils, the site
is predominantly surficial and lacks potential for significant site component preservation. Though one
possible burned rock feature was cursorily noted, the feature was not considered to contribute
positively to the site’s overall NRHP/SAL eligibility within the APE. No potentially significant features
(burned rock middens, artifact caches, etc.) were noted, nor were any temporally diagnostic artifacts.

Introduction and Project Description

The portions of the Site 41HY209 within the proposed APE do not warrant inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL.
Under the described proposed construction method, Site 41HY201 will not be adversely affected by the
proposed project, and no further work is recommended. If plans for the area surrounding Site 41HY201
change expansion of right of way is again proposed, NRHP/SAL-eligibility testing is strongly
recommended for the site area. Finally, the project engineer is not planning to expand the right of way
in the vicinity of the historic Barton Cemetery. Investigators surveyed beyond the existing right of way
and found no indication of potential unmarked interments (from surface inspection or subsurface tests)
in the surrounding area of the APE. The project engineer has elected to develop a proposed avoidance
strategy that involves construction of a retaining wall that will require no additional right of way in the
vicinity. This retaining wall is to be constructed approximately ten feet within current existing right of
way. By design, retaining walls planned for this project will be fixed in place to concrete leveling pads
set in place on top of the current grade and supported by earth reinforcement buildup of imported fill
material. It is therefore recommended that the cemetery will not be impacted by the proposed project.
Hicks & Company recommends that the proposed project would not likely impact archeological historic
properties, and, pursuant to 36 CFR 800 and 13 TAC 26, construction should be allowed to proceed with
no further cultural resource coordination. Any adjustment to the project limits included in this report
should be coordinated for potential cultural resource impacts prior to construction. All project-related
records will be permanently curated at the TARL in Austin, Texas. This report is offered in partial
fulfillment of TAC Permit Number 4981.

Environmental Setting

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
GEOLOGY, SOILS AND HYDROLOGY
The FM 1626 Pass-Through Toll APE is located west of the city of Buda in Hays County, Texas. Generally
speaking, the APE is situated within the Balcones Escarpment which separates the Blackland Prairie on
the east from the Edwards Plateau on the west (Bureau of Economic Geology 1996). Across this
physiographic boundary are many changes in topography, soils, flora, and fauna. Limestone hills, thin
soils, and narrow watercourses in steep canyons characterize the Edwards Plateau region west of the
escarpment, while the Blackland Prairie to the east is characterized by deep, fertile soils on level to
gently rolling terrain with low gradient streams.
The city of Buda is located near the southern edge of the Colorado River Drainage Basin (to the north)
and the Guadalupe River Drainage Basin (to the south). The area is drained by numerous streams
generally flowing in an easterly direction. The main waterways are Bear, Cypress, and Onion Creeks and
the Blanco and San Marcos Rivers. Hays County and the city of Buda are situated within the
northeastern portion of the Edwards Aquifer Recharge and Transition/Artesian Zone where the nearby
San Marcos Springs (the second largest in Texas, 16 miles south) delivers approximately 102 million
gallons of water daily. Onion Creek and Mustang Branch bisect the APE along with a minor stream
created by Cole Springs.
According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas: Austin Sheet (Barnes 1981), soils within the APE consist of
siliceous coarse gravel, sand, silt, and clays formed over Cretaceous Age limestone, marl, and chalk
(Appendix A: Exhibit 2). Seventeen different soils are mapped within the proposed right of way; each
occupies areas of less than 1 percent to approximately 18 percent of the total proposed APE. Those that
comprise greater than 10 percent of the area each include: Krum clay (18%), Castephen clay loam (12%),
Tarpley clay (12%), and Gruene clay (11%). Gruene clay is formed within an area of Pleistocene Age
fluviatile terrace deposits located around Onion Creek and Mustang Branch and presents the greatest
likelihood of subsurface site preservation. Most of the previously recorded sites are found within or in
close proximity to this area. Unfortunately, an active gravel quarry also occupies much of the terrace
and has disturbed and/or completely removed any intact archeological deposits. Aside from this
location, there are no major drainages that have the potential for deep Holocene alluvium; however,
shallowly buried sites have been recorded throughout the project corridor in the older, upland clays.
These site reports indicate shallow soil and a lack of deposition in these locations.
VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE
The APE lies in the Edwards Plateau vegetational area near its boundaries with the Blackland Prairie,
Post Oak Savannah, and the South Texas Plains vegetational areas of Texas (Gould 1962). The Edwards
Plateau vegetational area is characterized by a dissected plateau originally covered by open savannah
with trees and brush occupying rocky slopes and stream bottoms. Today, the region is characterized by
predominantly Live Oak-Ashe Juniper woodland, interspersed with rangeland (Correl and Johnston 1979,
Hatch et al. 1990).

Environmental Setting

The APE lies near the eastern edge of the Balconian biotic province, near its boundaries with the
Tamaulipan and Texan biotic provinces (Blair 1950). The Balconian province represents a transitional
zone where many wildlife species are reaching the limits of their ecological tolerance (Blair 1950). The
eastern edge of the Balconian province is formed by the Balcones Escarpment which separates the
Balconian from the Texan and Tamaulipan provinces of east and south Texas, forming a formidable
barrier for faunal migration. Numerous streams dissect the eastern and southern edges of the
Balconian, providing major avenues of dispersal for many species. Fifty-seven mammal species, one
land turtle species, 16 lizard species, 36 snake species, 15 anuran species, and seven urodele species are
known from the Balconian province. Common avian species include Mourning Dove (Zenaida
macroura), Crested Caracara (Caracara plancus), western scrub-jay (Aphelocoma californica), Bewick’s
Wren (Thryomanes bewickii), and Painted Bunting (Passerina ciris). Terrestrial species observed include
eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), gray fox (Urocyon
cinereoargenteus), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), redstripe ribbon snake (Thamnophis
proximus rubrilinetus), and six-lined racerunner (Cnemidophorus sexlineatus).
LAND USE
The APE is approximately two miles west of the Interstate Highway (IH) 35 corridor west of the city of
Buda (Appendix A: Exhibit 1). The majority of the project will be constructed on public land that falls
within the existing FM 1626 right of way, estimated at 54.3 acres (Figure 1). An additional 11.24 acres of
adjacent land acquired from private ownership was necessary to complete the proposed construction
project. Much of the properties are agricultural and residential within the northern portion of the APE
(Figures 2 and 3). Utilities are routed along the edge of the roadway which have disturbed sediments
within the existing right of way (Figure 4). Near the central portion of the FM 1626 corridor, land use
shifts to large, primarily commercial quarry properties (Figure 5) with some agricultural use and no
residential properties. The active gravel quarries have severely disturbed the APE through the maximum
depth-of-impact as well as the surrounding area. Narrow corridors of riparian vegetation surround
channels of Onion Creek and Mustang Branch (Figure 6).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The APE for the proposed project is located within the Central Texas archeological region. Most of the
recent chronologies for Central Texas are based on six distinct time periods, representing roughly a
12,000-year sequence of occupation. A synthesis of the culture-historical sequence from Collins (2004)
and Johnson (1995) is as follows: Paleoindian (prior to 8800 BP), Early Archaic (8800-5800 BP), Middle
Archaic (5800-4000 BP), Late Archaic (4000-1400 BP), Post-Archaic or Late Prehistoric (AD 600-1600),
and Historic (AD 1600 to present). Although these divisions represent convenient temporal categories,
they are also based in large part on perceived adaptations in subsistence and are reflected in changes in
lithic and other technologies.
Paleoindian (prior to 8800 BP)
The early Paleoindian culture in South and Central Texas is believed to be related to the well-known big
game hunting tradition of the Great Plains (Hester 1980). Most of the well documented early
Paleoindian sites in Texas that are associated with extinct megafauna are located north and west of
Central Texas on the Llano Estacado and adjacent areas of the Southern High Plains. In general, early
Paleoindian sites are scarce in Central Texas or at least not as visible as later sites. Conversely, later
Paleoindian sites are much more numerous in South and Central Texas, although both are usually
identified from only surface-collected artifacts (Black and McGraw 1985). Subsistence data from several
late Paleoindian sites does suggest, however, that small game was being exploited rather than extinct
megafauna. This data supports the idea that a hunting and gathering lifestyle may have already been
adopted across much of Southwest and Central Texas prior to the Early Archaic period.
Paleoindian occupations in Central Texas have typically been associated with lanceolate projectile points
such as Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina, Meserve and stemmed points such as Scottsbluff (Turner
and Hester 1993). Recent investigations at the Wilson Leonard Site (Collins 2004, 41WM235) equate
three styles of projectiles, Golondrina/Barber, St. Mary’s Hall and Wilson to the Late Paleoindian period.
The Wilson component is dated at 10,000 to 9650 BP (stemmed points) and is associated with features,
a burial and artifacts that are more Archaic-like in nature than Paleoindian (Collins 2004). The data from
the site further suggests that the Archaic nature of the adaptation continues during the ensuing
Golondrina/Barber and St. Mary’s Hall components (see below). These are dated between 9500 and
8800 BP and may represent a transitional period between the Paleoindian and the Archaic.
Early Archaic (ca. 8800 - 5800 BP)
At the Wilson-Leonard Site (41WM235), the Early Archaic period is subdivided into three projectile point
style intervals: Angostura, Early Split Stem and Martindale/Uvalde, from 8800 to 6000 BP (Collins 2004).
At this site, the shift from Paleoindian to Archaic subsistence strategies is measured by a change in
technology focused on the use of burned rocks to process geophyte plant foods. This shift is traced back
as early as 8800 BP at the Wilson-Leonard site and at roughly comparable ages at several other Central
Texas sites (Black et al. 1998; Decker et al. 1999; Thoms et al. 1996). At these sites, the use of earth

Cultural Background

ovens and burned rock technologies for the possible processing of plant foods is associated with
lanceolate Angostura projectile points. The use of Angostura and late Paleoindian lithic technologies
may have continued on into the Early Archaic period for a time but was gradually replaced by the
bifurcate base split-stem and Martindale/Uvalde styles.
The Early Archaic marks the shift to use of multiple tons of burned limestone and other rocks in the form
of scatters, hearths, middens and other features for the processing of plant foods. This represents the
start of a long-lived Archaic cooking tradition which lasted from roughly 8800 to 1400 BP. This tradition
was characterized by the repeated utilization of earth ovens and the creation of burned rock middens at
strategic places on the landscape. These new subsistence practices began with a distinctive cooking
technology using layered arrangements of heated rocks in earth ovens which allowed for the
exploitation of a broad range of geophytes. These included upland xerophytic plants like sotol and other
species such as Lily family onion bulbs which grow in wetter environments (Decker et al. 1999).
Some of the most recent climatic reconstructions for the period posit a moist and cool late Pleistocene
environment with early to mid-Holocene shifts to drier conditions that became most pronounced during
the mid-Holocene (ca. 5000-7000 BP, Ricklis and Collins 1994). In contrast, Johnson (1995) suggests that
the relatively mesic conditions of the eastern Edwards Plateau during the Pleistocene and early
Holocene/Paleoindian period witnessed a brief dry interval during Late Paleoindian times, which later
again became more mesic during the ensuing Early Archaic period (roughly 8000-5800 BP). Whether the
Early Archaic climate reflects a gradual drying period (Ricklis and Collins 1994), or a more mesic interval
within an overall, long lived trend towards aridity along the eastern Edwards Plateau, it appears that the
use of burned rock midden technologies for plant food and other types of subsistence related
processing began during this period and continued for many thousands of years.
Overall, the bulk of the Central Texas archeological literature suggests that the Early Archaic occupations
were generally small, widely distributed, and non-specialized (Black and McGraw 1985). Explanations
for these characteristics support a generalized hunting-gathering strategy involving relatively high group
mobility, poorly defined territories, and short-term occupations. Broad spectrum and well adapted,
highly mobile subsistence strategies are theorized. Regional population density may have been low,
though this may reflect a sampling bias in terms of well documented Early Archaic sites (Ricklis and
Collins 1994).
Middle Archaic (ca. 5800 - 4000 BP)
The Middle Archaic marks an intensification of the use of burned rock technologies to process plant and
other types of foods within an increasingly arid environment. Ricklis and Collins (1994) recognize a
pronounced mid-Holocene drying event which occurred from 7000 to 5000 BP, but which may have
lasted longer. Johnson (1995) posits the occurrence of a dry Edwards Interval along the eastern
Edwards Plateau from roughly 5500 to 1400 BP. Evidence for this is the cessation of significant overbank
sediment aggradation at a number of Central Texas sites. Instead of deposition, arid conditions caused
extensive downcutting and erosion along many Central Texas streams. Dryer conditions favored the
spread of desert succulent xerophytic plants and fostered the proliferation of burned rock middens.

CSJ#: 1539-01-013

Cultural Background

Dryer conditions may also have engendered the return of bison to the plateau during the Middle and
Late Archaic Intervals. The proliferation of Bell/Andice/Calf Creek projectile point styles at the beginning
of the Middle Archaic may have coincided with the return of bison to the Edwards Plateau and adjacent
Blackland Prairie. These broad bladed points may have been well adapted to the exploitation of bison.
Additional Middle Archaic styles include Early Triangular, La Jita, Nolan and Travis.
Late Archaic (ca 4000 - 1400 BP)
Recent refinements in the Central Texas chronology divide the Late Archaic interval into two different
subperiods, I and II (Johnson 1995). Subperiod I is marked by the appearance of Bulverde projectile
points, which along with later forms (Pedernales, Castroville, Marshall and Montell) were used to hunt
bison and other large game. Burned rock middens continued to proliferate during the Late Archaic I
interval. The resources processed may have included yucca, sotol, and perhaps agave lechuguilla. Other
middens may simply be dumps for kitchen type debris which contain sizeable quantities of animal
bones, broken stone tools, and flint-knapping detritus (Johnson 1995). Pedernales peoples, in
particular, may have been adept at both hunting and the processing of large volumes of plant food
materials.
The Late Archaic II interval (ca. 600 BC-AD 600) may have been a time of increasingly mesic conditions
for all but the western and southwestern portions of the Edwards Plateau (Johnson 1995). The onset of
more mesic conditions may have resulted in decreased numbers of upland xerophytic (dry-weather
adapted) plants and perhaps bison (Johnson 1995), which may have forced adjustments in prehistoric
subsistence strategies. There appears to be a decrease in the number of burned rock middens that can
be directly attributable to the Late Archaic II interval. The projectile points used at this time are smaller
and are characterized by such styles as Ensor, Fairland, Frio and Darl. The large projectiles well adapted
to bison hunting may have been gradually replaced. There is evidence that the spread of Eastern
Woodland religious cults may have had an influence on the Late Archaic II peoples of Central Texas
(Johnson 1995).
Late Prehistoric (ca. AD 600 - 1600)
The Late Prehistoric or Post-Archaic (ca. AD 600-1600) (Johnson 1995) in Central Texas is marked initially
by the replacement of the dart and atlatl with the bow and arrow, as reflected in the shift from dart
points to smaller, thinner and lighter arrow points (Ricklis and Collins 1994). Despite the shift to the
bow and arrow, there is every indication that the broad based hunting-gathering economy of the Late
Archaic persisted into and through most of the Late Prehistoric period. The latter part of this period is
marked by the appearance of pottery and a distinctive complex of tools composed of contracting-stem
Perdiz arrow points, an abundance of unifacial end scrapers, thin, alternately beveled bifacial knives,
and drills or perforators made on flakes and blades. The Post-Archaic era again turned dry and
somewhat arid towards the middle of the Late Prehistoric, during which there was a rather dramatic
increase in the bison exploitation. It appears that bison hunting became an increasingly important
economic activity during the later part of this period.

Historic Period (AD 1528 – Present)
The most radical changes in the Native American history of Central Texas came during the historic era
(Black 1989). The horse was introduced into North America by Spanish settlers in the sixteenth century.
Nomadic groups, initially the Apaches and later the Comanches, adopted the horse and rapidly altered
the aboriginal situation of Central Texas. These nomadic groups entered Central Texas from the plains
and mountain areas to the north and west and within 150 years had forced most of the native peoples
to flee. Most groups were simply destroyed by the combined effects of the nomadic raiders and the
foreign diseases introduced by the Europeans. Others moved south entering Spanish missions and
settlements, or eastward to join various agricultural groups such as the Wichita (Black 1989).
The historic period in Texas begins with the arrival of Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca and other survivors of
the Navarez expedition on the Texas coast in 1528, although there may have been earlier landings (Cecil
and Greene 2001). In any case, the influences of European colonization were not felt strongly in Texas
for several centuries. By the middle of the eighteenth century, however, the Spanish had established
missions in east Texas and settlements in south Texas. This resulted in massive depopulation and
cultural disintegration among native Indian groups.
The first Europeans to visit the area of present-day Hays County were probably members of the
Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition of 1709. In 1755, the Spaniards established the mission San Xavier
and the presidio San Francisco Xavier which quickly succumbed to Indian attacks (Cecil and Greene
2001). The area remained unsettled for another half century. In the early nineteenth century, the
Spanish made another attempt with the settlement of San Marcos de Neve. Spanish officials sought to
increase the population of Texas in response to the Louisiana Purchase. This settlement lasted until
1812 when unrelenting Comanche raids and floods forced abandonment of the settlement. The area
continued to be traversed by Spanish and later Mexican travelers on the Old San Antonio Road that ran
between northern New Mexico and Nacogdoches. Between the 1830s and 1840s the first white settlers
moved into the area. In 1848, Hays County, named for Texas Ranger John Coffee Hays, was organized.
The young community of San Marcos was chosen as the county seat. The city of Buda was established in
1881 on donated land surrounding an International Great-Northern Railroad depot. Buda continued to
grow until the time of the Great Depression, at which time the population dropped from approximately
600 to 300. It wasn’t until the mid-1980s, as the City of Austin expanded, that the town’s population
began to rise again.
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The Central Texas archeological area is one of the better known regions of the state. More sites have
been recorded, tested, and excavated in Central Texas than any other part of the state (Black 1989).
Most of the prehistoric sites in Central Texas are open, unprotected sites situated on alluvial terraces
adjacent to streams or rivers (Black 1989). A typical open site in Central Texas contains refuse such as
chert flaking debris, broken chert tools, fragmented burned rock, land snails, fragmented animal bone
(uncommon), and charred plant remains (rare) (Black 1989). Burned rock middens are Central Texas’
most characteristic archeological feature. These fire-cracked and discolored limestone features are
found in terrace or upland settings. They usually contain other cultural debris in association, indicating

Cultural Background

their significant role in prehistoric open occupations. An additional trait of open sites is the presence of
diagnostic stone tools often representing occupations from different periods or phases, ultimately
suggesting repeated use over hundreds or perhaps thousands of years.
Background research for this project was conducted using the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas, as well as relevant soil, geology, and topographic data sets. According to
available data, seven previously recorded archeological sites and one historic cemetery were identified
within one kilometer of the APE (Appendix A: Exhibit 3). No Official State Historical Markers (OSHMs)
are located within the APE, nor are there any State Archeological Landmarks (SALs), or sites listed in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). However, two sites that are likely to be impacted were
listed as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. According to maps located at the THC, archeological survey
investigations were conducted by the State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (SDHPT)
within the existing right of way prior to the construction of this portion of FM 1626. Four additional
surveys were conducted by Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) archeologists in close
proximity to the APE including a separate SDHPT-sponsored survey for an apparent realignment of the
southern portion of the roadway. The remaining three surveys did not intersect the currently proposed
APE, and no archeological sites were identified near the corridor as a result of these investigations.
More than 200 archeological sites have been recorded across Hays County. Many of the intensive
archeological investigations of the area have occurred in the vicinity of San Marcos Springs (the second
largest natural cluster of springs in Texas) issuing from fissures in the Edwards Limestone below presentday Spring Lake. Two sites of particular importance fall within the proposed APE: Sites 41HY202 (the
Barton Site) and 41HY209 (the Mustang Branch Site), along with an additional five archeological sites
(41HY199-201, 41HY210, and 41HY219) that were recorded in the 1980s.
All seven of the previously recorded archeological sites located within or immediately adjacent to the
proposed right of way were recorded as a result of investigations conducted between 1987 and 1989 by
the SDHPT prior to construction along FM 1626. The northernmost of these, 41HY199, was recorded as
a prehistoric lithic scatter for which additional shovel testing was recommended to verify the
shallowness of the deposits. Sites 41HY200 and 41HY201 are prehistoric campsites located on opposite
banks of Onion Creek. Site 41HY200 appears to be a minor campsite but was recommended for testing
because of its location and the possibility that buried deposits could prove to be significant. Site
41HY201, on the south terrace of Onion Creek, was recorded as an expansive but shallow campsite from
which debitage, bifacial, and unifacial tools were recovered. This site was also recommended for
testing. All of these sites would be impacted by the currently proposed construction project.
Data recovery investigations were conducted by members of TARL at Sites 41HY202 (the Barton Site)
and 41HY209 (the Mustang Branch Site) within the existing right of way in 1989 (Ricklis and Collins
1994). Both of these sites have been recommended as eligible for NRHP listing. Previous excavations on
the northern portion of Site 41HY202 revealed seven burned rock features, over 4,000 pieces of
debitage, and 42 stone tools, particularly scrapers. Based on projectile point typology and inconsistent
carbonate coating on the burned rocks, investigators determined that cultural components have been
mixed in the northern portion of the site. Excavations of the southern half of the site revealed intact

Cultural Background

buried features of Late Prehistoric, Late Archaic, and Early Archaic age. Excavations of the site were
restricted to the existing right of way; therefore, the expansion of FM 1626 under the currently
proposed project was determined to likely affect additional portions of the site. The results of this
revisit, wherein it was recommended that the portions of the Site 41HY202 within the proposed APE do
not warrant inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL, are discussed below in the Results of
Field Investigations Section.
As a part of the same project, excavation at Site 41HY209 documented a burned rock midden near the
edge of a bluff containing a thin veneer of Late Prehistoric material overlying a significant Late Archaic
occupation. The terrace area near Mustang Branch yielded Late Prehistoric Toyah and Austin Phase
components as well as a deeply buried Late Archaic component. The remainder of the site underwent
controlled surface collections up to 250 meters south of Mustang Branch. The results current
investigations, recommend that the portions of the Site 41HY209 within the proposed APE do not
warrant inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL, are discussed below in the Results of Field
Investigations Section.
Near the southern end of the proposed APE, Site 41HY219 was recorded as a low-density scatter of
debitage, burned rock, and one thin biface fragment. No further work was recommended based on
shallow soils and lack of cultural materials beyond the plow zone. The southernmost site in the
proposed APE, Site 41HY210 (the Manlove Hill Site), is a historic site that was also recorded in 1987. It is
located just north of the intersection of FM 1626 and FM 2770. The site was investigated through
archival research, surface collecting, and plow-zone stripping. The archival research indicated that the
land may have been inhabited just prior to the Civil War, but field investigations only uncovered artifacts
from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Additionally, three features were recorded: a
set of metal bars that may have been boundary markers, a caliche roadbed that probably leads to the
site of the homestead, and the remnants of an unlined cistern. The investigators stated that the
majority of the site was located outside of their right of way. No further work was recommended for
the site within the APE for that project.
Site 41HY491 is located approximately ten meters east of the APE between Cole Springs Road and Old
Black Colony Road. This site is referred to as the Freedmen Farmstead and was established in the 1860’s
by emancipated African Americans. No proposed right of way acquisition or construction impacts will
affect this site. Survey and shovel testing of the existing right of way and planned easement locations
adjacent but outside the boundaries of this site noted that the immediate area had been previously
disturbed by drainage ditch construction, utility installation and residential development.
Barton Cemetery is located adjacent to the west side of FM 1626 (Appendix A: Figure 3). This historic
cemetery has marked graves ranging in age from 1873 through the time it was recorded in 2003 (Hearn
and Kerbow 1994; HCHC 2009). The cemetery, established in 1881, contains a mixture of marked
graves, both with and without dates, and unmarked graves. Although the cemetery is not likely to be
impacted by the current project, interments could possibly be encountered within the proposed
expanded right of way.

Methodology

METHODOLOGY
Investigations followed the survey standards set by the THC and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
for intensive linear investigations and consisted of one transect on each side of the existing highway
within the APE (13 TAC 26.20 and THC policy) (Appendix A: Exhibit 4). Shovel tests were distributed at
approximately 100-meter (300-foot) intervals across the APE. All shovel tests were terminated at a
maximum depth of 100 centimeters below ground surface unless pre-Holocene deposits, bedrock or
extremely dense clay was encountered and were at least 30 centimeters on a side. All excavated soil
from shovel tests was screened through quarter-inch wire mesh. Each shovel test was recorded in tencentimeter levels on standardized forms and plotted onto a site sketch map or an aerial photograph of
the APE. Once test data were recorded, all of the shovel tests were backfilled. Areas of disturbance were
noted and recorded through photographs and field notes. Artifacts from all subsurface tests were
documented, photographed, and returned to the site area. All site records were recorded and
submitted electronically to TARL for inclusion in their database. Field documentation is located in
Appendix D.
Backhoe excavations were designed to remove consecutive layers of earth in order to locate and expose
potential cultural features or occupation levels within areas exhibiting the potential for site burial.
Within the APE, deep sediment was present only in the floodplain north of Onion Creek. The backhoe
employed a toothless bucket to excavate trenches, which were excavated to the maximum reach of the
backhoe (approximately 3 meters) or bedrock. Backhoe excavations were directed and monitored by an
archeologist certified as a competent person trained in Occupational Safety and Health Association
(OSHA) trench safety standards.
Sediment from every approximately ten-centimeter level
(approximately one of every four bucket passes) was screened through quarter-inch wire mesh. Each
backhoe trench was recorded on a standardized form with notes made for stratigraphy, features, and
cultural artifacts, if present. A soil profile, plan view map, and photographs were recorded for each
trench. After these data were recorded, the backhoe trenches were backfilled.
The surveyed area measures approximately 81 acres in total. Current CTA/THC standards for projects of
this size are a single test per every two acres (13 TAC 26.20). During the current investigations, Hicks &
Company excavated a total of 102 shovel tests and seven backhoe trenches, exceeding the minimum
CTA/THC requirements.
Archeological site investigations adhered to the THC/CTA standards for site recording (13 TAC 26.20) and
evaluated all cultural resources for potential site integrity of setting, association, and design in relation
to the National Parks Services criteria for eligibility of listing in the National Register of Historic Places
(36 CFR 60.4). No fewer than six shovel tests and/or backhoe trenches were excavated at each
archeological site location in order to delineate site boundaries relative to the APE and evaluate the site
in terms of context, depth, artifact content, and definitive characteristics.
Investigators used a Trimble GeoExplorer XT GPS unit with sub-meter accuracy and detailed maps to
locate and record excavations within the APE. GPS positions were recorded for all shovel tests and

maps by Hicks & Company GIS personnel. The current investigations underwent a no-collection policy.

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
EXISTING RIGHT OF WAY
The existing right of way was subject to pedestrian inspection to determine the presence of
archeological cultural resources. Due to heavy disturbance as a result of highway construction, utilities
routing, and residential and commercial driveways, the existing right of way represents no probability
for encountering intact archeological deposits. On each side of the paved roadway, drainage ditches
have been excavated, and reinforced culverts are routed beneath roadway-driveway intersections
(Figure 7). Investigators observed several markers for buried utilities, which typically parallel FM 1626
near the outer edge of the existing right of way. Two shovel tests were excavated within the existing
right of way in the area of newly documented Site 41HY449 due to the presence of prehistoric artifacts
on the ground surface. These shovel tests were both positive for cultural material within the upper 10
centimeters of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/1) clay loam sediment. It is likely that these artifacts
represent a secondary depositional context due to their location in a very discrete concentration along
the property-right of way boundary fenceline. Site 41HY449 will be discussed in greater detail in the
Site Descriptions section of this report. Additionally, one shovel test was excavated within portions of a
minor surficial lithic debitage scatter within the existing right of way adjacent to Site 41HY209 (Site
Descriptions). This test was negative for cultural resources and revealed extremely shallow, stony
upland soils. Thirty additional shovel tests were excavated within the existing FM1626 right of way due
to a high degree of disturbance, and no additional archeological investigation is recommended within

PROPOSED NEW RIGHT OF WAY PEDESTRIAN SURVEY AND SHOVEL TEST SUMMARY
Archeologists performed a 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey of the proposed new right of way
(Appendix A: Exhibits 5-1 to 5-4). Heavy disturbance was observed throughout much of the APE,
attributed to the initial construction of the roadway and the adjacent artificial drainages, utilities
routing, agricultural activity, active gravel quarries, dumping, and residential activity. A total of 72
shovel tests were excavated during the current field investigations with proposed new right of way, 30
of which were positive for cultural material. Of these, six were excavated within the vicinity of newly
recorded Site 41HY449. This is the only new site documented as a result of the survey, and a detailed
narrative will follow in the Site Descriptions section. All remaining positive shovel tests were located
adjacent to or within the boundaries of shallow, previously recorded sites that will also be discussed in
detail in the following section on Site Descriptions.
Investigators began surveying at the northern project terminus, where FM 1626 intersects RM 967 and
proceeds south. The northernmost section, between RM 967 and Cole Springs Road, is characterized by
relatively flat to rolling upland prairie land that has been historically utilized for agricultural purposes.
Crops are currently growing along the east side of the right of way, where surface visibility is nearly 100
percent (Figure 3). This area was shovel tested at opportunistic intervals due to high surface visibility
and instances of clear disturbance. The western proposed right of way in this area is occupied by
commercial and residential properties (Figure 8). One particularly significant element of disturbance
was noted on the west side of FM 1626 directly opposite Cole Springs Road where a large artificial water
tank has been constructed with a large berm occupying the proposed right of way for nearly 400 meters.
Surface visibility through typically short landscape grasses ranged from 5 to 50 percent and shovel tests
were excavated at 100 meter intervals in undisturbed areas. A total of 33 shovel tests were excavated
between RM 967 and Cole Springs Road, five of which were positive for cultural material in the area of
Site 41HY449. Site 41HY449 is a lithic scatter that was identified on the ground surface south of RM 967
along a property fenceline. Artifacts were confined to a narrow, disturbed area on either side of the
fenceline and none of the five shovel tests excavated revealed subsurface deposition beyond
approximately five centimeters. Sediments were generally characterized by compact clay loams with
calcium carbonate nodules that become increasingly dense with depth. Elm Grove Elementary School is
located in this area, on the east side of FM 1626 across from Site 41HY449. Paved driveways and a
graded surface characterize the current state of the landscape on the school property. Although the
area is still largely rural, with agricultural fields abutting the current FM 1626 right of way, the large
majority of residential properties fall within the northern portion of the APE located between RM 967
and Cole Springs Road. The proposed new right of way in these areas exhibited signs of surface grading
and modification for residential landscaping (Figure 2) and agricultural production (Figure 3).

Additionally, a large, prominent artificial water tank is situated on the west side of FM 1626 at the Cole
Springs Road intersection (Figures 9 and 10). Within the proposed expanded right of way, this tank has
resulted in severe disturbance to the natural landform through extensive grading and the installation of
the earthen dam immediately adjacent to the existing right of way. This disturbance was so extensive
that shovel testing was not conducted in its vicinity (between JC2 and MM5). As part of the
undertaking, the project engineer is electing to remove the portion of the earthen dam within the right
of way.

Previously recorded Site 41HY199 was found to extend into the proposed, expanded right of way on the
west side of FM 1626 approximately 230 meters south of Cole Springs Road. This site consists of a
surficial and shallowly buried scatter of lithic debitage, tested cobbles, tools, and burned rock that
currently exists only outside of the current right of way and was observed to extend farther to the west
than its initial boundary. A total of eight shovel tests were excavated on the site (Shovel Tests BJ2-3, 1621), five of which were positive for cultural material to a maximum depth of 20 centimeters below the
surface. Site 41HY199 will be discussed in further detail in the following Site Descriptions section. The
property located in the portion of the APE south of Cole Springs Road, on the opposite side of FM 1626
from Site 41HY199 accounts for approximately 137 linear meters of proposed right of way along the east
side of the existing FM 1626 roadway (0.40 acres). This property is residential and has been leveled
(Figure 11). Home, driveway, entryway construction and landscaping have destroyed any integrity of
the shallow soil deposits in the area. The property was visually inspected from the FM 1626 right of way
and no cultural materials were observed. As such, no further investigation of the property is
recommended for the project to proceed to construction in this area. The remaining portion of the
proposed right of way, north of Onion Creek was found to be disturbed and devoid of historic or
prehistoric archeological cultural resources within any additional shovel tests (Figures 12 B13).

The area of Site 41HY200 was surface inspected prior to the excavation of Backhoe Trench 1, but no
indication of cultural material was observed. This property has undergone heavy modification as a
result of extensive quarrying activity (Figure 5) and the construction of a stone parking pad which has
likely removed all remaining portions of Site 41HY200 within the proposed right of way. Backhoe
trenches dug in this area were devoid of cultural materials and abundant in evidence of sub-surface
disturbance (see below). Soils remained unchanged (hard, compact clay with calcium carbonate) and
many areas (particularly north of Backhoe Trench 2) were not subject to shovel testing due to significant
surface modification or buried utility encumbrances. A total of 18 shovel tests and 7 backhoe trenches
were excavated in the area between Cole Springs Road and Onion Creek.
Immediately south of Onion Creek, on a high terrace that has been partially disturbed by the FM 1626
bridge construction, buried utilities, and a transmission line pole, investigators revisited Site 41HY201. A
dense concentration of artifacts, along with one potential burned rock feature, was present on the east
side of FM 1626 while additional site components (isolated lithic debitage and biface fragments) were
identified along the west side of the road. Investigators have extended the site boundary to include the
APE from the gravel quarry access road north to the edge of the Onion Creek terrace. This site will be
discussed in further detail in the Site Descriptions section.
Nearly all of the proposed right of way between Onion Creek and Mustang Branch has been destroyed
by quarry or borrowing activity. Nearly the entire length of the proposed expanded right of way in this
segment is set noticeably below the prevailing ground surface. Access roads from FM 1626 have been
lined with imported gravel, completely obscuring the surface in some portions of the proposed right of

way (Figure 14). A total of 27 shovel tests were excavated between Onion Creek and Mustang Branch,
16 of which were positive for cultural material.
Soils typically consisted of dark brown to very dark grayish brown silty clay to a depth of 30 to 50
centimeters, where bedrock or dense gravels were encountered. In other areas, the original ground
surface has been completely removed by quarrying activity, leaving deep pits along the sides of the
highway (Figures 15 and 16). These areas were subject to pedestrian inspection, however, no shovel
tests were excavated in areas of clear surface disturbance.

Although, much of this area has been disturbed as well, investigators found portions of the original
surface, within which partially-intact cultural deposits were encountered. No elements of Site 41HY202
were encountered on the west side of FM 1626. The borrow pit area (see Figures 17-18) truncates the
northern portion of this site while a large and heavily-utilized gravel haul road used for the extensive
gravel-mining operation on the property destroyed all site elements to the south (see the Site
Descriptions section for detailed information on Site 41HY202).

Barton Cemetery Area
Archeologists paid particular attention to portions of the proposed APE adjacent to the Barton
Cemetery, located on the west side of FM 1626 approximately 100 meters north of the mining haul road
(Figure 19). The cemetery was established in 1881, deeded by James U. Barton. At the time of
establishment, fourteen graves were already existent within the originally three-and-a-quarter-acre
area. According to available information, Barton Cemetery contains several Civil War veterans among
the graves as old as 1873 and as recent as the modern day (Hearn and Kerbow 1994; HCHC 2009).
Though initially isolated in a pasture, the cemetery is now visible from FM 1626. Archeologists paid
close attention to marked interments in the vicinity of the APE and the potential for additional burials
outside of the fenced and marked boundary.
Archeologists visually inspected the archeological APE in the vicinity of Barton Cemetery and found no
surficial evidence of marked or unmarked interments. Instead the existing right of way in this area was
heavily graded for drainage and contained nearby markers for buried utilities. Investigators surveyed
immediately beyond the archeological APE and conducted limited subsurface shovel testing adjacent to
the cemetery boundaries. The land was primarily dense riparian woodland growing along steep
eastwardly-descending slopes to the north (the cemetery itself is situated on a terrace overlooking these
steep slopes) and flat, manicured grasses and the cemetery entrance to the south. Four shovel tests
excavated were negative for cultural materials or evidence of burials. Soils in this vicinity were
extremely shallow and stoney clays, most often measuring less than 20 centimeters deep.
Visual inspection of the cemetery from its marked boundary revealed that several early grave sites are
found very near to the cemetery fenceline to the east; however, there did not appear to be any spatial
patterning associated with the apparent age of the interments. Instead older grave sites were found
intermixed throughout the area with younger burials. Without this spatial pattern, it could not be
postulated that burials extended in one direction or another through time.
While this lack of pattern could not outright negate the potential for unmarked burials to be found
within the archeological APE, archeologists did note a heavily overgrown, but distinct old trail or
roadway that paralleled the existing cemetery fenceline along its exterior through most of its vicinity
with the project corridor (Figure 20). Hicks & Company archeologists hypothesize that this trail/road has
been in place for a relatively long time and would most likely not have overlapped any possibly
unmarked interments as those would have been more recent at the time of the road’s use, and in turn
more likely to have had extant markers. Indeed, since this trail/road so closely matches the existing
cemetery fenceline, it is very likely that the current cemetery boundary has not changed (at least along
its eastern edge). As such, any interments, marked or unmarked, would not likely extend outside of this
boundary. Additionally, the area was surveyed as part of the original highway construction project in
1989 and was determined to not impact human burials. Since the project engineer is electing to not
expand in this vicinity and is erecting a retaining wall just east of the right of way, the overall potential
that this undertaking will physically impact the cemetery is extremely low. On August 5, 2012, TxDOT
staff archeologist Jon Budd interviewed the Barton Cemetery Association Chairman, Mr. Robert Barton,
via telephone. In conversation, Mr. Barton related that the first grave dates to 1873 and the cemetery

was originally deeded in 1881. Mr. Barton’s expert opinion is that there are no marked or unmarked
graves located east of the currently established Barton Cemetery boundaries. Based on this testimonial,
TxDOT concludes that minimal potential exists for marked or unmarked graves associated with Barton
Cemetery to exist within the APE and recommends that no further work in regard to this cemetery is
warranted (personal communication, Jon Budd to Hicks & Company, September 19, 2012).

clearing is visible on the right side of the photograph).

All proposed expanded right of way south of Mustang Branch is owned by a single landowner.
Immediately south of Mustang Branch, the waterway has eroded a broad hill creating a large bluff that
rises approximately 50 feet from the waterway. This bluff face was too steep to warrant shovel testing,
however, once on the hilltop, the soils were notably shallow, and stony with large sheets of exposed
bedrock evident. Due to excellent surface visibility, as well as the limitation of right-of-entry in this area,
no subsurface tests were excavated on the hilltop. Archeologists did note an extension of Site 41HY209
along the top of this hill, as a distinct scatter of lithic flakes and occasional burned rocks (particularly
along the west side of FM 1626) were noted near the northern edge of the hilltop. Survey of the Site
41HY209 area is further discussed below.
Moving south, the hilltop descends distinctly to the lower landform that occupies the remainder of the
segment. Through this southern segment, archeologists excavated a total of 22 shovel tests, five of
which were positive for cultural resources. Archeologists noted that along the overwhelming majority of
the expansion corridor’s length south of Mustang Branch, the archeological APE had excellent visibility
due to recent plowing on both sides of FM 1626. Combined with generally shallow soils, the extent of
plowing through most of this segment has significantly reduced the potential for archeological site
preservation. Shovel Test MM202 typifies the soils observed through most of this segment with 36
centimeters of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) soft, loamy clay overlying light brownish gray (10YR
6/2) loamy, chalky decaying bedrock. While archeologists did encounter remnants of both recorded
archeological sites (41HY210, and 219) within the proposed expanded right of way along the east side of

the road within this plowed field segment, these components were extremely diffuse and primarily
limited to the ground surface (see Site Discussions below).
TRENCH EXCAVATION SUMMARY
A total of seven backhoe trenches were excavated within the proposed FM 1626 APE (Appendix A:
Exhibits 5-1 to 5-4). All of these trenches were excavated on the north side of Onion Creek, where the
depth of alluvial sediment exceeded shovel test depths (see Figure 1). Three trenches were excavated
on the east side of FM 1626 between the terrace edge and the base of the rolling uplands. All of these
trenches were negative for cultural material, including Trench 1, which was excavated in the area
mapped as Site 41HY200. Four trenches were excavated on the west side of the roadway. Only the
southernmost of these, Trench 4, was positive with one piece of lithic debitage recovered from 0 to 65
centimeters and another from 155 to 180 centimeters below the surface. This trench was excavated on
the low terrace, still within the frequently flooded overflow channel of Onion Creek and the artifacts are
not considered significant due to their likely displacement by high energy flood water. A detailed
description of the results of each backhoe trench follows.
Backhoe Trenches 1, 2, and 3
Backhoe Trench 1 was located approximately 15 meters from the edge of the Onion Creek Terrace,
north of the creek and east of FM 1626. This property has undergone significant modification and
although excavated within the mapped boundary of Site 41HY200, no sign of the previously recorded
site was observed. As described earlier, most of the APE within the mapped boundary was composed of
a graded gravel parking pad with a buried utility line. A 30 centimeter layer of gravel fill was laid atop
the graded surface (Figure 21). Just north of the trench location is a crushed limestone parking pad.
Beneath the imported fill, soil consisted of dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) extremely compact silty clay
displaying slickensides, approximately 20 percent chert cobbles, and 10 percent calcium carbonate. At
110 centimeters below the surface, the clay transitioned to a slightly lighter dark brown (7.5YR 3/4)
dense clay with no chert cobbles and 30 percent calcium carbonate. From 148 to 196 centimeters
below the surface, the soil consisted of strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) silty loam, within which a large crack
was present. Dense chert cobbles (approximately 80 percent) were present in the same soil, beginning
around 196 centimeters and continuing to 217 centimeters below the surface where the trench was
terminated (see Figure 20). No cultural material was encountered in Backhoe Trench 1.

Figure 21: Backhoe Trench 1, west wall profile showing 30 centimeters of gravel fill, facing west.

Backhoe Trench 2 was excavated adjacent to an open gravel pit, approximately 100 meters north of
Trench 1. The first meter below the surface was introduced gravel and trash fill and a distinct line was
encountered at approximately one meter, running down the middle of the trench, parallel to the trench
walls; disturbed fill to the east and natural soil to the west. Apparently (and according to the backhoe
driver), the gravel pit once extended out to this point and was subsequently refilled. The trench was
then moved slightly farther west before continuing, to avoid excavating through disturbed soil. Below
the layer of fill, soils were very similar to those recorded in Backhoe Trench 1. The exception to this was
that the upper layer of natural soil, between 100 to 165 centimeters below the surface was slightly
darker (black; 7.5YR 2.5/1) and extremely dense. Dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) dense clay continued to 240
centimeters and the trench was terminated at 293 centimeters below the surface, within a similar
strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) crumbly, silty loam (see Figure 22). Aside from modern trash fill at the top, no
cultural material was encountered in Backhoe Trench 2.
Backhoe Trench 3 was excavated at the extreme northern end of the high terrace (approximately 250
meters north of Onion Creek), on a small rise at the base of the rolling upland hills. This property is
currently open pasture land and has not been subject to the extensive modification observed to the
south. From the surface to 90 centimeters, the soil consisted of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty
clay loam with some sand and fragmented rabdotus shell. The second soil zone was comprised of
brown (7.5YR 4/4 and 4/3) very compact, silty clay with approximately 5 percent calcium carbonate.
This zone continued to 165 centimeters below the surface. The final zone was a very pale brown (10YR
7/4) and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), friable silty clay with approximately 10 percent calcium carbonate. A
caliche lens was observed within this soil at 165 to 180 centimeters below the surface (see Figure 20).
No cultural material was encountered in Backhoe Trench 3.

Backhoe Trenches 4, 5, 6, and 7
Backhoe Trench 4 was excavated on the low terrace, on the frequently flooded overflow bank of Onion
Creek on the west side of the FM 1626 bridge, approximately 50 meters north of the current creek
channel. The surface of the bank is hummocky and covered in tall grasses and giant ragweed. This
landform is frequently flooded and the potential for deposition was thought to be high. The upper 65
centimeters of soil consisted of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly silt loam, high energy flood
deposits. Within this soil, one chert flake fragment was recovered. From 65 to 155 centimeters below
the surface, a homogeneous silty clay loam alluvium was encountered, which had no gravels or
inclusions. Immediately below this alluvium, large and very dense gravels were encountered that
continued to the top of consolidated limestone bedrock at a depth of 180 centimeters below the
surface. Another flake fragment was recovered from the upper portion of this gravel deposit
(approximately 155 to 170 centimeters). Neither of the pieces of lithic debitage recovered from this
trench are considered significant due to their presence within high energy flood deposits. The primary
context of these artifacts is therefore unknown.
Backhoe Trench 5 was excavated on the higher, secondary terrace on the west side of FM 1626 north of
Onion Creek. Small gravels and cobbles are exposed in areas across the surface which is mostly covered
in tall grasses. Twenty seven centimeters of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam was
found beneath the surface. Below this was a slightly lighter (dark grayish brown; 10YR 4/2) silty clay
loam with a very high caliche and gravel content. Bedrock was encountered much higher than
anticipated, at 43 centimeters, indicating an eroded terrace edge (Figure 23). No cultural material was
encountered in Backhoe Trench 5.

Backhoe Trench 6 was located approximately 100 meters north of the terrace edge in an open pasture
of tall grasses and scattered mesquite trees on the west side of FM 1626. The upper 46 centimeters in
this trench consisted of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) crumbly silty clay loam with a small amount of calcium
carbonate nodules. The soil becomes slightly darker below this (black; 10YR 2/1) and slightly more
dense with minimal calcium carbonate inclusions. From 80 to 140 centimeters below the surface, soil
consisted of mottled (brown, dark gray and red) dense gravelly clay. Within this soil, the percentage of
calcium carbonate increased with depth and excavation was terminated due to ancient Pleistocene-age
clay. No cultural material was encountered in Backhoe Trench 6.
The final trench, Backhoe Trench 7, was excavated in the same pasture, approximately 200 meters north
of Onion Creek on the west side of FM 1626. Black (7.5YR 2.5/1), compact and blocky silty clay with
limestone and chert gravels was present from the surface to 56 centimeters. Below this was uniform
brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay. This soil continued to 174 centimeters below the surface, with calcium
carbonate and gravels present only to approximately 113 centimeters. From 174 to 279 centimeters, soil
consisted of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), very homogeneous clay. Calcium carbonate became present at
approximately 258 centimeters (comprising 15% of matrix) and increased with depth (Figure 24 and 25).
Trench excavation was terminated at 279 centimeters, the maximum reach of the backhoe. No cultural
material was encountered in Backhoe Trench 7.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
41HY449
Site 41HY449 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of unknown age encountered within the APE along the
fenceline marking the western edge of the existing FM 1626 right of way (Appendix A: Exhibits 5-1 and
5-3). The site is a dense surface scatter of debitage, bifaces, unifaces, and cores approximately 70
meters in length north to south and five meters wide. Five shovel tests conducted in the APE in the
vicinity where artifacts were found on the surface, failed to find any subsurface prehistoric components.
In addition, a probable pet cemetery was identified at the southern end of the site within the APE
(Figure 26).

Site Descriptions

Surface visibility in the site is very good, typically greater than 60 percent. The open surface likely
indicates that the site has been previously cleared and possibly farmed. Along the fenceline, there is
no ground cover and evident disturbance includes both the placement of regularly spaced fence posts
and a telephone pole in the right of way near the northern end of the site. At the southern end of the
site, a concrete driveway passes through a gate leading to the recently built house farther west on the
property, outside of the APE (Figure 27).

Figure 27: Site 41HY449 area, facing north.

The boundaries of Site 41HY449 are mapped based on the extent of prehistoric artifacts on the surface
and the results of shovel testing. Within the site boundaries the artifacts vary in surface density, with
the highest concentrations along the fenceline and quickly tapering off to the east and west (Figure 28).
Five shovel tests (Table 1), placed at approximately 10 meter intervals in areas of surface artifacts in the
APE, recovered artifacts in the upper 16 centimeters of the soil, but the effort failed to encounter any
evidence of intact, subsurface site deposits. Shovel tests inside the proposed right of way (BJ14, MS10,
BJ15) documented a dark gray 7.5YR 4/1 clay loam with small to medium limestone cobbles overlying
bedrock or large limestone gravels. The two shovel tests placed in the existing FM 1626 right of way
(MM17, BJ22), both encountered disturbed very dark gray (10YR 3/1) loamy clay mixed with limestone
gravels overlying limestone. The lack of any subsurface deposits and the curious linear distribution of
the prehistoric materials along the eastern property boundary, strongly suggest that they are not in
their primary context. Based on the location of the site and the surficial nature of the deposits, it seems
most plausible that the site was created as a result of construction on part of the property to the west or
during the construction of FM 1626 to the east, whereby the artifacts were redeposited in their current
location along the property boundary. The apparent absence of comparable materials on the east side
of FM 1626, however, makes it most probable that there may be, or was in the past, a prehistoric site
west of the APE, beyond the area surveyed.

A pet cemetery/commemorative site is located on what is currently private property at the northeast
corner of the driveway at the property fence. It consists of a small rectangular concrete slab paralleling
the fenceline with three plaques placed in line on the concrete that read: (from north to south) “Lyla,”
“Jade,” and “Shay 1990-2003” (Figure 29). South of the plaques a concrete marker reads “If love could
have saved you, you would have lived forever.” The ground surface west of the concrete is notably
bare. Based on the condition of the construction, it appears to have been built within the last 20 years.
Though speculative, the area is likely the location of a pet cemetery or commemorative site built by the
owner.

Given the unclear provenance of the prehistoric artifacts, the lack of temporal diagnostics, and no
evidence for intact site deposits in the APE, Site 41TV449 is not eligible for nomination as an SAL or for
the NRHP under any criteria. Since the pet cemetery/commemorative site is clearly less than 50 year
old, it too is considered NRHP/SAL ineligible. It is recommended that no further archeological
investigation is warranted for this site. However, because Site 41TV449 could possibly extend to the
west outside of the proposed APE, additional archeological survey is recommended to determine the
possible boundaries or location of intact site components if construction activities extend outside the
proposed APE.
41HY199
Originally mapped in the center of FM 1626 south of Cole Springs Road, archeologists found that the
boundaries of Site 41HY199 extended farther to the west. Though no archeological materials were
noted in the current right of way, likely a result of the previous construction effort, a low density scatter
of tested cobbles, debitage, tools, and burned rock was noted within the proposed right of way during
archeological survey (Appendix A: Exhibits 5-1 and 5-3).
Surface visibility across the site varied from 10 to 90 percent. The highest incidence of surface artifacts
occurs in the northern half of the site immediately south and west of the fenceline that divides the
current right of way from the proposed right of way, where the surface is disturbed. In general, the
portions of the site in the proposed right of way north of Shovel Test BJ20 are located on a gentle
southeasterly slope covered with patchy grass and mesquite, with excellent surface visibility and
artifacts visible on the surface (Figure 30). The relative openness of this part of the site is likely to be a
result of the clearing or plowing of the property in the past, activities which would have negatively
impacted the integrity of any surficial or shallowly buried deposits. South of Shovel Test BJ02, the

surface is relatively flat and the vegetation switches to oak trees and grasses with considerable leaf litter
limiting surface visibility. An entryway and electric gate have been constructed in the southern portions
of the site between Shovel Tests BJ20 and BJ21, disturbing the site surface. Where surface visibility
permitted an accurate assessment, artifact density was typically less than one artifact per square meter,
with isolated clusters of two to four artifacts per square meter. The types of artifacts observed on the
surface were primarily angular chert shatter or fire cracked rock, tested chert cobbles, and debitage
consistent with early stage lithic reduction. A single edge modified flake was noted near Shovel Test
BJ16 (Figure 31).

Site Descriptions

The seven shovel tests (BJ2, BJ16-21) excavated across the site indicate that within the proposed right of
way, site deposits are limited to the upper ten centimeters of soil, with the majority of artifacts
registered on or just beneath the surface. Artifact recovery from these shovel tests was typical of that
observed on the surface, except for a small bifacially reduced fragment found in the upper 10
centimeters of Shovel Test BJ16. Otherwise the artifacts recovered were primarily angular chert shatter
and several primary or secondary flakes. The results of the shovel tests are summarized in Table 2.

The results of these shovel tests and the surface artifacts observed during this survey are consistent with
observations made at the site during its initial identification in 1987. At that time, recorders identified
the site as a surficial lithic scatter associated with the exploitation of lithic resources in the surface
deposits. Based on a visual observation of the ground surface west of the proposed right of way, the
site appears to continue to the west and up to the top of the low ridge located in the northwest portion
of the site (within the project APE). At present it is not possible to accurately gauge the potential for
higher integrity site deposits west of the current APE, or to judge the full extent of the site to the west.
Current investigations indicate that the portions of Site 41HY199 in the project APE do not have
characteristics that would qualify it for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion D or for formal designation
as an SAL. The portion of Site 41HY199 investigated within the proposed APE therefore warrants no
further archeological investigation prior to construction. Although no further work is recommended
given currently proposed design impacts, since 41HY199 possibly extends to the west, outside of the
proposed APE, additional archeological work is recommended if construction activities extend beyond
the currently proposed project APE.
41HY200
Site 41HY200 was previously recorded in 1987 as a minor campsite on the edge of a high terrace
approximately 125 m north of Onion Creek (Appendix A: Exhibits 5-2 and 5-4). The site was originally
mapped as measuring 50 m north–south by 150 m east–west and contained flakes, a biface, and a
projectile point (untyped) to a depth of 50 centimeters below surface. No cultural materials were
recorded at the site during this time, and the site was not recommended as eligible for listing as an SAL
or on the NRHP.
No evidence of Site 41HY200 was detected during the current investigation. Surface inspection of the
previously recorded site area documented a high level of disturbance as a result of quarrying activity
and parking pad construction; no artifacts were noted in the area. Excavation of BHT 1 within the

Archeological Survey – FM 1626 Pass-Through Toll Project – December 2016

47

CSJ#: 1539-01-013

Site Descriptions

previously recorded site boundaries revealed a lack of artifacts below the surface and confirmed that
the area has been severely modified by quarrying activity and construction of a parking pad.
It was determined during the current investigation that any remaining evidence of Site 41HY200 was
likely destroyed during ground-disturbing activities within the area. Therefore, the site is not
recommended as eligible for listing as an SAL or on the NRHP, and no further work is recommended
within the APE for the previously recorded location of Site 41HY200 prior to construction.
41HY201
Site 41HY201 is located on both sides of FM 1626, along a high upland ridge overlooking Onion Creek to
the north (Appendix A: Exhibit 5-2 and 5-4; Figure 32). Though now removed from the final project
design, archeological survey conducted in 2008 included areas of proposed new right of way, a 15 meter
wide corridor on the west side of the road over a length of approximately 150 meters extending from
the edge of the Onion Creek bluff line south. The site boundaries extend to the east occupying the
upland ridge at the confluence of Mustang Branch and Onion Creek. The site consists of a dense scatter
of prehistoric lithics between the surface and 38 centimeters below ground surface and a burned rock
feature on the surface. Conducted outside of the current APE, six shovel tests were excavated within
the existing site boundaries and four of these were positive for archeological deposits. Investigations
were not conducted within the existing right of way as this area had been heavily modified by previous
highway construction. On the eastern side of the road alignment, as delineated by shovel testing, the
site extends 40 meters south from the same bluff line. A revised site boundary for the portions of Site
41HY201 that are within and/or adjacent to the proposed project area is presented below in Figure 32.

Site Descriptions

The site area is within a pasture dominated by tall grasses and scattered mesquite trees affording zero
percent surface visibility (Figures 33-34). At the northern edge of the site, along the bluff edge of Onion
Creek the site is covered with dense riparian vegetation. Surface visibility was higher, 30 to 60 percent
along the margins of the pasture and riparian zone. The northern end of the site terminates where the
landform drops steeply into the Onion Creek drainage. Disturbances noted include a small push pile
near the northern end of the site and a concentration of large limestone blocks in the south. Within the
existing right of way the road has been cut down into the bluff of Onion Creek and the non paved
portions of the right of way/APE have been sloped to accommodate drainage (Figure 35). These slopes
extend from the right of way fence to the edge of the pavement. Having been heavily modified during
the construction of FM 1626, the potential for intact archeological deposits within the existing right of
way/APE is extremely low.

Site Descriptions

The boundaries of Site 41HY201 are mapped based on the extent of archeological deposits on the
surface and the results of shovel testing. A total of seven shovel tests were excavated within the site
boundaries along the east side of the road at intervals of 15 to 20 meters. Four of these tests were
positive for archeological deposits between the surface and 38 centimeters. On the west side,
archeologists excavated a total of seven additional tests (MM101-103, MC1-4). Soils within the site are
primarily mapped within the Gruene clay (GrC) which are shallow clays overlying cemented caliche and
gravels. The soils observed within the shovel tests were consistent with the Gruene clays exhibiting very
dark gray (10YR 3/1) silty clay loams to a depth of 50 centimeters. The shovel tests were terminated at
bedrock between 35 and 38 centimeters. In Shovel Tests BJ4, MM2, MM3, and MC4 at the south end of
the site, a dark reddish brown (5YR 2.5/2) zone was encountered between 16 and 50 centimeters
overlying bedrock.
A total of 205 pieces of lithic debitage, 25 burned rocks, 3 informal tools, and two biface fragments were
observed on the site. Due to the low surface visibility only a few artifacts were identified on the surface
around Feature 1 and Shovel Test BJ4. These artifacts included chert shatter, one tertiary flake, and one
edge modified flake around BJ4 and two secondary flakes and a biface fragment within Feature 1. The
distribution of artifacts is depicted below in Table 3. Based on the results of the shovel testing the
highest density of artifacts occurs between the surface and 20 centimeters. The east side of FM 1626
contained by far the most dense, and intact elements of the site, as the west side was found to be
extremely diffuse, and within otherwise disturbed context, intermixed with push piles. The vast
majority of the lithic debitage observed consists of waste material from late stage lithic production. All
of the lithics observed appeared to be Edwards chert that would be locally available. Feature 1 was the
only feature observed on the site and is a concentration of burned rock (Figure 36) located at the
northern end of the site within the proposed right of way. The feature was delineated by clearing some
of the overlying leaf litter and mapping the feature as it appeared at the surface. Feature 1 is roughly
ovate measuring approximately 105 cm in length and 55 cm in width. A crude biface fragment, two
secondary flakes, and 15 burned limestone rocks were identified in the feature. No charcoal was
observed in the feature, but none of the feature was excavated.

Figure 36: View of Feature 1 in plan view.

Site 41HY201 represents a well-preserved, upland prehistoric open campsite. The artifacts observed on
the site are buried within the upper 40 cm of sediment and an intact burned rock feature is present on
the site. Two formal tools and three informal tools were also observed on the site. No diagnostic
artifacts or charcoal were observed during the survey, but there is no evidence that organic preservation
on the site is poor or that diagnostic artifacts would not be present. The high percentage of late stage
lithic waste material suggests the potential for additional formal tools and projectile points is high. The
presence of Feature 1 also suggests the potential for additional features, possibly in better contexts, to
be discovered. It is the opinion of the investigators that a determination of NRHP or SAL eligibility for
the site in its entirety cannot be made at this time. Given the potential significance of the site, the
project engineer has elected to avoid site impacts by not acquiring any additional right of way in this
area. Furthermore, construction activities at this location will not require excavation of the existing
ground surface. One small portion of the site will be impacted at its southern end west of FM 1626;
however, this area was extremely diffuse, and likely the most disturbed portion of the site. As such,
those potential impacts would not be to potentially NRHP/SAL-eligible components, and the engineer
has effectively developed a feasible avoidance plan. No further work is recommended given currently
proposed design impacts as the portions of the Site 41HY201 within the APE do not warrant inclusion in
the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.

Site Descriptions

41HY202
Site 41HY202 is located on a high upland ridge overlooking Mustang Branch (a tributary of Onion Creek)
approximately 150 meters to the south (Appendix A: Exhibits 5-1 and 5-4; Figure 37). The site consists
of a moderately dense scatter of prehistoric lithics between the surface and 40 centimeters and a
burned rock feature on the surface (Figure 38). An earlier design indicated that proposed right of way
would pass through the APE of Site 41HY202; however, this was eliminated in the final design.
Archeological survey was conducted in this area before this design change occurred. Hence, seven
shovel tests were excavated between the existing site boundaries within the previously proposed extent
of new right of way, a 15 meter wide corridor over a length of approximately 50 meters, extending from
a graded quarry road north, with all of these tests positive for archeological deposits. Shovel testing was
not conducted within the existing right of way as this area had been heavily modified by previous
highway construction.
Vegetation on the site consists of hardwood trees in the wooded areas with sparse grasses, mesquite,
and cacti in the cleared areas. Ground surface visibility is 50 to 100 percent within the cleared areas and
there is no visibility in the wooded portions. The entire area surrounding the site has been completely
destroyed by a large borrow area/gravel mine. The northern and eastern boundaries of the site drop off
steeply into the borrow area. To the south of the site is a large graded haul road used for the borrow
area/gravel mine. This road is also built up from the base of the borrow area further to the east and
outside of the APE. The portions of the site within the proposed APE have also been heavily disturbed.
The high upland ridge that the site occupies has been cut down approximately one meter on the edge of
the proposed right of way and some in the northern portion of the site. These portions of the landform
that have been cut down mark the edges of the wooded portion of the site. A large push pile is located
along the east edge of the proposed right of way where material has been bulldozed. The only portions
of the site that appear to be intact are those within the wooded area. The cleared areas of the site have
suffered from severe erosion.

As originally mapped (and depicted in Appendix A, Exhibit 5-2 and 5-4) Site 41HY202 measures
approximately 90 meters east to west by 225 meters north to south. The western boundary conforms to
the current alignment of FM1626 while the eastern boundary lies approximately 60 meters east of the
proposed new right of way survey corridor. The site is bisected by the Haul Road which enters the site
from the northeast before aligning north to south, paralleling FM1626. Within the survey corridor,
intact elements of Site 41HY202 extend from Haul Road north approximately 50 meters to where the
landform drops steeply into the borrow area (Figure 39). A total of five shovel tests were excavated
within the boundaries of the site at intervals of ten meters. All of these tests were positive for
archeological deposits between the surface and 40 centimeters below surface; all of these tests are
located outside of the current APE. Soils within the site are primarily mapped within the Gruene clay
(GrC) which are shallow clays overlying cemented caliche and gravels. The soils observed within the
shovel tests were consistent with the Gruene clays exhibiting brown (10YR 4/2) calcareous, silty clay
loams to a depth of 15 to 30 centimeters before encountering dense gravels. The shovel tests were
terminated at dense gravel bedrock between 15 and 50 centimeters. Shovel tests excavated in the
wooded portions (Shovel Tests MS1 and MS5) of the site were slightly deeper than those excavated
outside of the woods (Shovel Tests MS1, JC1, JC8, and BJ1).

piles at right and left. Haul road is in foreground.

A total of 32 pieces of lithic debitage and more than 32 pieces of burned rock were noted during survey.
The distribution of artifacts is depicted below in Table 4. Based on the results of the shovel testing the
highest density of artifacts is occurring between 20 and 30 centimeters below surface. Several artifacts
were visible on the surface within the graded and bulldozed portions of the site. These mostly consisted
of secondary and tertiary flakes and other debitage. The vast majority of the lithic debitage observed
consists of waste material from late stage lithic production. All of the lithics observed appeared to be
Edwards chert that would be locally available. Feature 1 was the only feature observed on the site and
is a loosely concentrated scatter of burned chert and limestone (Figure 40) located at the northern end
of the site outside of the APE. The components of the feature consist of small fragments of burned
chert and limestone with two secondary flakes on the west edge of the feature. The feature appears to
have been disturbed by either grading or vehicle traffic which has likely broken several of the rocks and
scattered the components of the feature beyond their original context. No charcoal was observed in the
feature, but none of the feature was excavated.

Site 41HY202 appears to be the remains of a prehistoric open campsite. Much of this site has been
heavily disturbed by borrow/mining activities. All noted preserved areas of the site appear to contain
intact subsurface archeological deposits; however, these deposits occur in low density outside of the
APE. Overall, the site has poor integrity and lacks research potential. The portions of the Site 41HY202
within the proposed APE do not warrant inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.
SITE 41HY209
Site 41HY209 is located at the top of a high steep bluff and hilltop overlooking Mustang Branch to the
north (Appendix A: Exhibits 5-2 and 5-4; Figure 41). Although the THC’s Sites Atlas has the previously
recorded site’s boundaries located approximately 90 meters east of the current FM 1626 right of way
boundary, a sparse scatter of prehistoric lithics was observed on the surface along the extreme eastern
and western portion of the current right of way with scatters continuing beyond eyesight in both
directions into the proposed expanded right of way. However, based on the THC’s site form
descriptions and the location description, the artifacts observed in the current right of way are likely an
extension of Site 41HY209. This extended site boundary is represented below in Figure 41.

Site Descriptions

The hilltop is dominated by exposed limestone bedrock and large degrading limestone cobbles in an
area of high surface visibility. One shovel test (MC107) was excavated immediately adjacent to the
eastern boundary of the current right of way to determine the exact depth of deposits. Impenetrable
bedrock was encountered just below a thin layer of topsoil to a maximum depth of four centimeters
with no artifacts encountered. No additional shovel tests were conducted within the existing right of
way due to the shallow soils and amount of disturbance caused by a large cut section from previous
highway construction and buried utilities as evidenced by markers (Figure 42). Two shovel tests (MC105
and MC204) were conducted immediately south of the site boundary; both of these shovel tests were
negative for cultural material. Five shovel tests (AG1, AG2, and GC1–GC3) were conducted within the
proposed right of way adjacent to Site 41HY209 to correlate the potential for subsurface deposits with
the limits of noted surficial artifact deposits (Appendix A: Exhibits 5-2 and 5-4). These five shovel tests
were negative for cultural materials. A single, biface was recorded as a surface-find adjacent to Shovel
Test GC1 and a biface fragment was observed on the east side of FM 1626 within proposed expanded
right of way, apparently in disturbed context as it was sitting on a tree stump. Ground surface visibility
is between 80 and 90 percent within the investigated existing right of way and approximately 70-80
percent within proposed new right of way. The northern boundary of the site is the steep bluff
overlooking Mustang Branch, while the southern boundary extends approximately 200 meters south of
Mustang Branch. The northern bluff was found to be very steep and rocky where it had not been
disturbed by highway and drainage improvement construction, and was considered to be very low in
site preservation potential (Figure 43). The new southern boundary of Site 41HY209 extends in the
northern portion of new proposed right of way along the eastern side of FM 1626 and is generally
delineated by a reduction in observed surficial lithics. This area is extremely narrow extending a
maximum of 30 feet from the existing right of way.

Figure 43: Steep, rocky dropoff to Mustang Branch that marks the northern perimeter of Site 41HY209, facing
east.

A total of 15 pieces of lithic debitage and two bifaces were observed within the APE on the site with the
majority (10+) observed in a small discrete concentration along the west side of the roadway near the
northern terrace edge. The artifacts mostly consisted of secondary and tertiary flakes. All of the lithics
observed appeared to be Edwards chert that would be locally available. The previously recorded site
form noted the presence of a burned rock midden, cores, bifaces, unifaces, projectile points and
numerous, widely scattered lithics both atop the hilltop and sloping down the sides towards Mustang
Branch. Therefore, based on the previous site form and current observations, Site 41HY209 appears to
be the remains of a prehistoric open campsite. Much of this site within the current project APE has
been heavily disturbed by construction associated with FM 1626 and buried utilities along both sides of
the roadway. Based on the exposed bedrock and lack of soils, the site is predominantly surficial and
lacks potential for significant site component preservation. Though one possible burned rock feature
was cursorily noted, the feature was not considered to contribute positively to the site’s overall
NRHP/SAL eligibility within the archeological APE. No potentially significant features (burned rock
middens, artifact caches, etc.) were noted, nor were any temporally diagnostic artifacts. The portions of
the Site 41HY209 within the proposed APE do not warrant inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an
SAL.
SITE 41HY210/41HY219
During the current field investigation, archeologists revisited the recorded boundaries of Sites 41HY210
and 219. These sites are located in very close proximity to one another near the southern project
terminus. Surface inspection and shovel testing in the sites’ vicinity indicated that, likely through
repeated plowing and general soil modification, the two sites have partially migrated into a single,

extremely diffuse, heavily disturbed, primarily surficial scatter of historic and prehistoric components.
Below is a brief discussion of the findings attributed to these two sites.
Site 41HY210 (the Manlove Hill Site), located just north of the intersection of FM 1626 and FM 2770, is a
historic site that was also recorded in 1987 (Appendix A: Exhibits 5-1 to 5–4). Artifacts observed during
the initial site recording included historic ceramics, glass shards, and metal fragments with one
diagnostic ceramic sherd dating from the late nineteenth century to the early twentieth century.
Additionally, three features were recorded: a set of metal bars that may have been boundary markers, a
caliche roadbed that probably leads to the site of the homestead, and the remnants of a cistern. As part
of the initial investigations, a brief search of deed records was conducted. This search revealed that a
Morton M. McCarver received the headright to this land in the year 1835. In 1837, McCarver conveyed
ownership to his attorney, George Tannehill who, in turn, conveyed the property to Memucan Hunt, a
hero of the Mexican War, in 1853. The exact year when this tract of land came into the possession of
R.C. Manlove is not known, but evidence suggests that it likely was between the years 1859 to 1862
(Ricklis and Collins 1994). R.C. Manlove shared the home with his wife, Margaret and their five children.
R.C. had the notable and honorable distinction of being the area’s doctor. In a history of the community
it was remarked that “the Manlove home was always open to those in need, and many sick and
wounded soldiers were cared for by these hospitable people” (Carpenter 1970:13). Dr. Manlove died in
his home in 1876 and was buried in nearby Barton Cemetery. As previously stated in the background
review portion of this report, the previous investigators stated that the majority of the site was located
outside of their right of way and no further work was recommended. The current investigations
encountered a rather sparse but broad scatter of historic ceramics, glass shards, and metal fragments
similar to the previous investigation (Figure 44). However, the previously mentioned features were not
investigated because the current investigation was limited to newly proposed right of way, an area that
was devoid of features. Based on observations from the project APE, the cistern appears to be located
below a small grouping of hardwood trees, approximately 15 feet east of the easternmost proposed
expanded right of way (Figure 45).
Site 41HY219 was originally recorded during investigations conducted between 1987 and 1989 by the
SDHPT prior to construction along FM 1626 (Appendix A: Exhibits 5-1 to 5-4). The investigations recorded
Site 41HY219 as a low-density scatter of debitage, burned rock, and one thin biface fragment mixed
within a shallow, plowed field. No further work was recommended based on shallow soils and cultural
materials that did not extend below the plow zone. The site boundaries available through the THC’s Sites
Atlas have the site’s western boundary approximately 30 meters east of the current proposed right of
way along the east side of FM 1626, however site records indicate that it was recorded within the existing
highway right of way. During survey within the proposed expanded right of way, ground surface visibility
was excellent at greater than 85 percent, thanks to recently plowed fields and generally low vegetation
due to drought conditions.

contained approximately 13 clear glass shards, four undecorated whiteware sherds, a screw, and two
undetermined metal fragments within the upper 30 centimeters of loamy, soft plowed sediments.

Site Descriptions

According to the property’s current landowner, the historic components of this site area are likely
attributed to his family as the property has been in his family’s ownership since before his birth (at least
as early as the early 1900s; Joseph Meador, personal communication). Hicks & Company archeologists
determined that all of the historic artifacts were isolated to the disturbed plow zone and are not
considered to be intact, or associated with any intact historic features. Based on the description of the
site from the previous visit and the results of investigations during the current visit, the site is isolated to
the heavily disturbed plow zone and does not likely contain any remaining intact archeological site
deposits. Recent and repeated plowing activity has likely moved artifacts from their observed locations
within Sites 41HY219 and 41HY210 during the initial investigation 20 years ago. Artifacts related to Site
41HY219 and 41HY210 within the proposed project APE are likely in secondary context due to repeated
plowing and other agricultural activity and therefore do not warrant inclusion in the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL, nor does it require additional investigation prior to construction. Additionally,
while, as its first physician, R.C. Manlove is a significant figure to the area’s history, recorded historic
artifacts were noted in mixed contexts both temporally and depositionally. Further, these artifacts were
low in count and very common to historic sites dating from the mid-nineteenth century to the midtwentieth century. Because these deposits lack integrity of location, design, setting, materials,
workmanship, and feeling, their possible association with R.C. Manlove isn’t believed to be enough to
qualify the portions of 41HY210 within the proposed project area as eligible for NRHP listing.

Temporary Construction Easements

TEMPORARY CONSTRUCTION EASEMENTS
Currently, 26 temporary construction easements are planned for the proposed project. Desktop review
noted that 14 of these easements (Easements 1, 2, 4, 7–11, 19–22, 24, and 25), totaling 0.22 acres in
size are in locations that were either assessed during initial survey of the APE from right of way extent or
are located within areas noted during survey to be disturbed (See Appendix A: Exhibits 5-1 to 5-2). On
January 21, 2016, Hicks & Company archeologists conducted survey of the remaining 12 easements
located outside of the existing or proposed new right of way, consisting of approximately 0.85 acres
located on 11 properties. The results of this survey work are presented below.
Easement #3, Shirrell Property
Easement #3, approximately 0.02 acres in size, is bounded on the west by the Shirrell Property fenceline
and the east by an overhead utility line (Figure 47). This easement was surveyed on January 21, 2016,
though, with negative Shovel Tests BJ13 and BJ10 previously conducted within 30 meters and 50 meters
respectively, was not shovel tested. No artifacts or cultural features were noted on the surface and it is
recommended that use of this area as an easement has no potential to affect cultural deposits eligible
as an SAL or for listing with the NRHP.

Temporary Construction Easements

Easement #5, Rutledge Property
Easement #5, approximately 0.20 acres in size was noted to be a thin strip of manicured land with good
grounds surface visibility. This easement was pedestrian surveyed but not shovel tested. No cultural
deposits were noted on the surface and the area was observed to have been previously disturbed by the
installation of overhead utility lines. It is recommended that disturbances planned for this easement will
have no potential to adversely affect cultural deposits.
Easement #6, Giberson Property
Easement #6, approximately 0.09 acres in size, is located at the very southwestern extent of a recently
cleared parcel just beyond the existing right of way limit, an area that has been previously disturbed by
the installation of underground utilities (Figure 48). Approximately 35 percent of the surface area of
Easement #6 was visible, with nearly 20 percent covered by limestone gravel fill (Figure 49). Shovel
Test MS20 was excavated ten meters to the north of Easement #6 noting culturally-sterile soils to 60
centimeters below surface. Based on high surface visibility and previous disturbances due to the
installation of underground utilities, it is recommended that disturbances planned for these easements
will have no potential to adversely affect cultural deposits.

Easement #12, approximately 0.03 acres in size, is located immediately south of a man-made stock pond
and overlays an area that has been disturbed for the creation of a raised berm that surrounds the stock
pond and a drainage-ditch that circles the stock pond (Figures 50 and 51). Shovel Test JC2, excavated
approximately 20 meters south of the planned easement location, terminated at 32 centimeters below
surface above a dense caliche layer indicative of paleosols unlikely to contain intact and eligible cultural
deposits. The area immediately north of Easement #12 was previously noted as being disturbed. Having
been previously disturbed by berm construction, it is recommended that disturbances planned for
Easement #12 will have no potential to adversely affect cultural deposits.

Easements #13 and #14, Townsley Property
At 0.08 acres in size, proposed Easements #13and #14 overlay a dirt driveway and the area immediately
adjacent that, for most of its length, is greatly sloped, returning to natural ground level at its eastern
extent (Figure 52). Shovel Test BJ5 was excavated 25 meters south of this easement location, noting
clays to a depth of 40 centimeters below surface, before terminating at limestone. With 100-percent
surface visibility in a previously disturbed setting, it is recommended that disturbances planned for these
easements will have no potential to adversely affect cultural deposits.

Proposed Easement #15, at approximately 0.06 acres in size, overlays a segment of a dirt driveway that
is bounded on both sides by push-piles of sediment and limestone (Figure 53). Shovel Test BJ5 was
excavated 40 meters north of this easement location, noting clays to a depth of 40 centimeters below

agricultural field (Figure 58). Plow-zone disturbances typically extend to depths of 30-40 centimeters
below surface (Abbott 2001). Confirmed by Shovel Test MC103, excavated approximately 10 meters
west of this easement, the Austin-Castephen complex soil series is mapped for this area and is generally
noted as having low potential to contain cultural deposits that retain integrity at any depth (Abbott
2013). It is recommended that disturbances planned for this easement have no potential to adversely
affect cultural deposits at this location.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On three occasions between July 28, 2008, and August 10, 2009, Hicks & Company archeologists
conducted an intensive linear archeological survey of the proposed FM 1626 improvements project west
of the city of Buda, Texas, on behalf of Hays County and TxDOT, returning to the field on January 21,
2016 to survey for proposed temporary construction easements located outside of the existing or
proposed right of way, and again on October 26, 2016 to survey proposed new right of way in previously
inaccessible parcels. The project was conducted for regulatory and management purposes under
Section 106 of the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26). All work was conducted under
the terms and conditions of the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (2005) among FHWA, TxDOT,
the THC and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation and the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) between TxDOT and the THC in support of research for a NEPA EA that received a Finding of No
Significant Impact (FONSI) on July 1, 2015. The current study was conducted under TAC No. 4981 and is
consistent with the THC minimum survey standards in high probability areas and the rules of practice
and procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas. The proposed linear APE is approximately 3.3 miles in
length and 200 feet wide, totaling an area of approximately 81 acres.
Investigations involved a combination of pedestrian survey supplemented by shovel testing and backhoe
trench excavations to identify and evaluate the horizontal and vertical extent of archeological deposits
within the proposed APE. A total of 102 shovel tests and seven backhoe trenches were excavated within
the APE. A single newly recorded archeological site (41HY449) was documented during the current
study, while seven additional sites (41HY199-202, 209-210, 219) were revisited.
Site 41HY201 is a prehistoric open campsite consisting of a dense scatter of lithics and a burned rock
feature. This site has a high density of material, formal tools, a feature, and the potential for intact
buried archeological deposits. The site also has good integrity in spite of its location on a high upland
ridge. This site was originally recommended for testing prior to the construction of FM 1626; the results
of the current investigations support this recommendation. (Appendix B: Typical Sections). While the
site’s southernmost tip will still be impacted by proposed construction, those areas were considered
diffuse and disturbed. The portions of the site with the greatest apparent integrity and potential for
NRHP/SAL eligibility will be successfully avoided. Although no further work is recommended given
currently proposed design impacts, if future design changes or an overall abandonment of this
avoidance strategy are adopted, it is strongly recommended that those portions of Site 41HY201 that
could be impacted be tested to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as
an SAL (36 CFR 800, 36 CFR 60, 13 TAC 26).
Site 41HY202 is a prehistoric open campsite located on the east side of the existing right of way within
the proposed APE. The site is a low density scatter of lithic debitage and a single burned rock feature.
The site has suffered from heavy disturbance associated with an adjacent borrow area/gravel mine; only
a small portion of this site remains even nominally intact. Although artifacts were recovered as deep as
40 centimeters, the site has very poor integrity and lacks research potential due to a paucity of
archeological material. The portions of this site within the proposed APE are recommended as ineligible

Conclusions and Recommendations

for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL; therefore, no further archeological work is
recommended for this site (36 CFR 800, 36 CFR 60, 13 TAC 26).
Sites 41HY199, 41HY209, 41HY210, 41HY219, and 41HY449 are undetermined temporal period
prehistoric and/or historic sites located in generally shallow, disturbed contexts throughout the project
corridor. The sites predominantly lack diagnostic artifacts, features, or other interpretable cultural
material that would warrant further investigation beyond that completed during the survey phase. As
such, any archeological deposits in these contexts would likely have very low potential for integrity of
location, setting, and association (36 CFR 60.4).
Site 41HY200’s mapped location was revisited; however, the area has been severely modified by
construction of a gravel parking pad and buried utilities. Thorough surficial and subsurface
investigations of the site area indicate that it is no longer extant and will therefore not be impacted by
the current undertaking.
Additionally, from available information, Hicks & Company concludes that the historic Barton Cemetery
will not be impacted by the proposed construction. While early burials are noted along the easternmost edge of the existing cemetery boundary and an overall burial pattern was not discernible, the
potential for unmarked graves to be located outside of the current fenced cemetery boundaries is
considered to be very low. Shovel tests excavated in the cemetery’s vicinity were also negative for any
cultural materials. Sitting on a terrace, unmarked burials would not likely be located on the steep,
eroding sides of the terrace to its north and would not be found in the disturbed gravel-hauling road and
cemetery access road to its south. Directly adjacent to the cemetery, archeologists noted an overgrown
historic trail or road that paralleled the existing cemetery boundary, reinforcing the assumption of very
limited potential for additional burials within the proposed expanded APE. In addition to avoidance, a
retaining wall is to be located 10 feet east of the right of way boundary, further limiting potential
impacts.
It is the conclusion of Hicks & Company that the proposed undertaking (including all portions of existing
and proposed expanded right of way) and construction should be allowed to proceed with no further
archeological cultural resource coordination required under Section 106 or the TAC (36 CFR 800, 13 TAC
26). A summary of findings and further recommendations for the revisited previously recorded sites and
newly recorded Site 41HY449 are included in Table 6.
This report is offered in partial fulfillment of TAC Permit 4981. To complete requirements of that
permit, all project related documents, forms, and photographs will be professionally curated at TARL in
Austin, Texas. The current investigations followed a no collection policy and all artifacts were returned
to their find locations following discovery and documentation.

Hicks & Company Research Design for Survey of
The FM 1626 Pass-Through Toll Project From FM 2770 to FM 967
CSJ: 1539-01-013
July 2008
This research design describes a 100% pedestrian, intensive linear archeological survey
along approximately 3.3 miles of proposed improvements to Farm to Market (FM) 1626,
west of the City of Buda in Hays County, Texas (Figure 1). The project, part of the
Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) pass through toll program is sponsored
up front with Hays County funding; however, following construction the roadway will be
transferred to TxDOT, which will pay the county back over time based upon use of the
roadway. The proposed expansion project would affect approximately 3.3 miles of FM
1626, from FM 2770 at the south end, to its northern terminus at FM 967 (Figure 1).
The existing undivided two-lane roadway varies from a 40- to 60- foot typical section
within the proposed project area. The project construction plan consists of four 12-foot
travel lanes (two in each direction), a 14-foot center left turn lane, and two 10-foot
shoulders along the outside. In order to complete the proposed improvements, the county
plans to expand the existing, variable, 120-foot-minimum right-of-way (ROW;
approximately 48 acres) to approximately 160 feet. Although construction will largely
take place on publicly owned ROW, the proposed expansion will require approximately
16 acres of additional ROW that is currently under private ownership. This expanded
ROW generally straddles the existing ROW but meanders occasionally from one side to
the other. Roadway design engineers do not anticipate significant subsurface impacts in
roadway construction and estimate a maximum depth of impact of four feet.
The project’s Area of Potential Effect (APE) is defined as all portions of lands (both
horizontal and vertical) that could be impacted by proposed construction and ROW
expansion including existing highway ROW and proposed expanded ROW. The project
APE is delineated as the edge of the proposed expanded ROW, for a total area of
approximately 64 acres. While the proposed expanded ROW corridor has largely been
determined, project engineers have requested to survey a 200-foot-wide archeological
study APE (100 feet in either direction from the existing road’s centerline) to allow for
flexibility in road design, potential utility relocation, and other possible areas of concern.

1

This will widen the proposed survey corridor an additional 20 feet on each side of the
existing ROW. As a result, a total of 80 acres of land is proposed to be evaluated in the
scope of the current investigation (including the existing and expanded ROW and the
proposed additional survey area). Any archeological sites identified or revisited within
the project APE will be evaluated for NRHP/SAL eligibility based on the requirements of
36 CFR 800, 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.20(1) and 13 TAC 26.20(2).
According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas, soils within the project area consist of siliceous
coarse gravel, sand, silt, and clays formed over Cretaceous Age limestone, marl, and
chalk. Seventeen different soils are mapped within the proposed ROW, which each
occupy areas of less than 1 percent to approximately 18 percent of the total proposed
project area. Those that comprise greater than 10 percent of the area each include: Krum
clay (18 percent), Castephen clay loam (12 percent), Tarpley clay (12 percent), and
Gruene clay (11 percent). Gruene clay is formed within an area of Pleistocene Age
fluviatile terrace deposits located around Onion Creek and Mustang Branch and presents
the greatest likelihood of subsurface site preservation. Most of the previously recorded
sites are found within, or in close proximity to this area. Unfortunately, a gravel quarry
also occupies much of the terrace and is likely to have disturbed and/or completely
removed any intact archeological deposits (Figure 1). Apart from this location, there are
no major drainages that have the potential for deep Holocene alluvium. However,
shallowly buried sites have been recorded throughout the project corridor in the older,
upland clays. These site reports indicate a lack of deposition and shallow soil. As much
of the project area is dominated by modern development, the APE is generally expected
to have good surface visibility.
Background research for this project was conducted using the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, as well as relevant soil, geology,
and topographic data sets. According to available data, there are seven archeological
sites and one historic cemetery that have been identified within the project area. No
Official State Historical Markers (OSHMs) are located within the project area, nor are
there any State Archeological Landmarks (SALs), or sites listed in the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP). However, two sites that are likely to be impacted are listed as
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. According to maps located at the THC, archeological
survey investigations were conducted by the State Department of Highways and Public
Transportation (SDHPT) within the existing ROW prior to the construction of this
portion of FM 1626. Four additional surveys have been conducted by Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) archeologists in close proximity to the
project area including a separate SDHPT-sponsored survey for an apparent realignment
of the southern portion of the roadway. The remaining three surveys do not intersect the

2

currently proposed project area, with and no archeological sites identified near the
corridor as a result of these investigations.
All seven of the archeological sites located within the proposed ROW were recorded as a
result of investigations conducted between 1987 and 1989 by the SDHPT. The
northernmost of these sites, 41HY199, is recorded as a prehistoric lithic scatter for which
additional shovel testing was recommended to verify the shallowness of the deposits.
Sites 41HY200 and 41HY201 are prehistoric campsites located on opposite banks of
Onion Creek. Site 41HY200 appears to be a minor campsite, but was recommended for
testing because of its location and the possibility that buried deposits could prove to be
significant. Site 41HY201, on the south terrace of Onion Creek, is recorded as an
expansive but shallow campsite from which debitage, bifacial, and unifacial tools were
recovered. This site was also recommended for testing. All of these sites may be
impacted by the currently proposed construction project.
Data recovery investigations were conducted by members of TARL at Sites 41HY202
(the Barton Site) and 41HY209 (the Mustang Branch Site) within the existing ROW in
1989. Both of these sites have been recommended as eligible for NRHP listing.
Excavations on the northern portion of Site 41HY202 revealed 7 burned rock features,
over 4,000 pieces of debitage, and 42 stone tools, particularly scrapers. Based on
projectile point typology and inconsistent carbonate coating on the burned rocks,
investigators determined that cultural components have been mixed in the northern
portion of the site. Excavations of the southern half of the site revealed intact buried
features of Late Prehistoric, Late Archaic, and Early Archaic age. Excavations of the site
were restricted to the existing ROW; therefore, the expansion of FM 1626 under the
currently proposed project will likely affect additional portions of the site. As a part of
the same project, excavation at Site 41HY209 documented a burned rock midden near the
edge of a bluff containing a thin veneer of Late Prehistoric material overlying a
significant Late Archaic occupation. The terrace area near Mustang Branch yielded Late
Prehistoric Toyah and Austin Phase components as well as a deeply buried Late Archaic
component. The remainder of the site underwent controlled surface collections up to 250
meters south of Mustang Branch. As with Site 41HY202, excavations of Site 41HY209
were conducted only within the ROW that existed at the time. The current project will
likely affect additional portions of the site. There is a high probability that significant
archeological deposits will be encountered at both of these site locations.
Near the southern end of the proposed project area, Site 41HY219 was recorded as a lowdensity scatter of debitage, burned rock, and one thin biface fragment. No further work
was recommended based on shallow soils and cultural materials that did not extend

below the plow zone. The southernmost site in the proposed project area, Site 41HY210
(the Manlove Hill Site), is a historic site that was also recorded in 1987. It is located just
north of the intersection of FM 1626 and FM 2770. The site was investigated through
archival research, surface collecting, and plow-zone stripping. The archival research
indicated that the land may have been inhabited just prior to the Civil War, but field
investigations only uncovered artifacts from the late-nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. Additionally, three features were recorded: a set of metal bars that may have
been boundary markers, a caliche roadbed that probably leads to the site of the
homestead, and the remnants of an unlined cistern. The investigators stated that the
majority of the site was located outside of their ROW. As such, it is likely that the
current project will encounter additional materials from this site.
Historic Cemetery
Barton Cemetery is located adjacent to the west side of FM 1626. This historic cemetery
has marked graves ranging in age from 1873 through the time it was recorded, in 2003.
The cemetery, formally established in 1881, reportedly contains unmarked graves in
addition to marked graves with and without dates. Although the cemetery is not likely to
be impacted by the current project, with unmarked graves already known at this site there
is a potential that additional interments may lie within portions of the proposed expended
ROW.
The proposed survey will take place on existing ROW and proposed new accessible
ROW currently in private ownership. The project APE is largely rural, with residential
properties occupying much of the northern portion and active quarry property in the
south. However, there are several tracts that have little or no development. These consist
of Bermuda grass pasture or mixed hardwood vegetation. There is a high potential for
unrecorded archeological resources to be affected by the FM 1626 expansion project,
particularly in the areas along Onion Creek and Mustang Branch, where several
archeological sites have been recorded in the area, both within the currently proposed
project corridor and the surrounding area.
Shovel testing will be conducted at a rate of 16 tests per linear mile per 100 feet of
expanded ROW width, in accordance with the THC’s minimum standards for linear
archeological survey. Survey methods may vary from this standard in areas that clearly
lack the possibility of containing intact archeological properties (i.e. disturbed contexts,
areas of exposed bedrock), and/or in areas with excellent surface visibility (>30% surface
visibility). Shovel tests will be excavated to a depth of one meter, to bedrock, or to
culturally sterile soils, whichever is encountered first. Soil from all shovel tests will be
screened through ¼” hardware cloth.

Given that significant archeological sites have previously been identified within the
project area within potentially deep soil contexts associated with Onion Creek and
Mustang Branch, backhoe trenching will likely be utilized as part of this survey.
Backhoe trenches will be excavated through the maximum depth of cultural deposition,
bedrock, or the maximum reach of the backhoe, whichever is encountered first. A
sample of soil from each 10 to 20 centimeter level (roughly one of every four bucket
scrapes) will be screened through ¼” hardware cloth. Investigators will record their
observations and the results of shovel tests and backhoe trenches through notes,
standardized forms, and photographs. Site definitions will comply with the Texas
Historical Commission’s/Council of Texas Archeologists’ (THC/CTA) survey standards
and policy including additional requirements for assessing historical sites and cemeteries
(see below). All archeological sites identified within the proposed ROW during the
survey will be investigated by means of no fewer than six shovel tests in order to define
site boundaries relative to the project corridor. Specific site information will be recorded
on standardized forms and eventually presented to TARL for inclusion in their archives
and, if necessary, production of new site trinomials.
Survey investigations will follow a modified no-collection policy. Isolated surface finds,
and non-diagnostic cultural material found in shovel tests will be documented, counted
and returned to their find location, and not saved for curation. If particularly significant
diagnostic material is recovered from sites only, they will be saved for curation at TARL
pending landowner approval. If present, these curated diagnostics may be composed of
both held-in-trust and state-associated collections.
Based on the 200-foot study corridor, approximately 32 acres of new ROW and expanded
survey area currently in private ownership would be evaluated for the proposed FM 1626
improvements in or near Buda. Right-of-entry (ROE) is currently available to 70% of
this area (approximately 22.4 acres). Project engineers are actively pursuing ROE to
currently inaccessible properties. As such, any parcels to which ROE is granted
subsequent to this application (but before field investigations) will be surveyed under this
permit as well. All areas, including both existing and proposed new ROW, for which
ROE is available, will be surveyed as part of this investigation. Because it has already
been largely surveyed and extensively excavated in site areas, the project’s existing ROW
will be briefly visually inspected to determine its potential for containing buried, intact
archeological materials and subsurface testing will be conducted if that potential is found
to exist. Additionally, should ROE not be granted to the remaining properties at the time
of survey, the ground surface within these areas will be observed for possible cultural
materials, erosion, or disturbance from the existing ROW.

Historical archeological sites will be documented not only through field efforts, but also
through survey level archival research. This research will include an attempt to
determine history of ownership and land use for each site through oral interviews, deed
research, and map research, wherever possible. Census records for individuals associated
with the site will be checked, and the names of these individuals will also be checked in
the Handbook of Texas. Should research reveal that historical archeological sites might
be associated with significant persons, investigators will make recommendations for
further archival or archeological work, to determine NRHP/SAL eligibility.
All work will be conducted under the terms and conditions of the First Amended
Programmatic Agreement (2005) among the Federal Highway Administration, TxDOT,
the THC and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and the Memorandum of
Understanding between TxDOT and the THC in support of research for a National
Environmental Policy Act Environmental Assessment (EA) that is in production.
The results of the investigation will be compiled into a professional report as required
under Chapter 26 of the THC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure and in conformance with
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (1966, as amended). The report
will describe the project area conditions and cultural background, existing and newlydocumented sites (including newly-produced site trinomials), ownership of the site
properties and NRHP/SAL eligibility of these sites based on the requirements of 36 CFR
800, 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.20(1) and 13 TAC 26.20(2). In
addition, the report will include listed and mapped locations of properties that were not
surveyed and recommendations on the need for further investigations in unsurveyed areas
and if necessary, at site locations. Two copies of this report will be submitted to TxDOTENV and the THC for review and comment, then resubmitted following the address of
any of these comments. All archeological sites located during the survey will be
recorded at TARL, and all project photographs, records, and artifacts will be curated at
that facility according to their standards.
Upon acceptance of the draft report by
TxDOT-ENV and the THC, 30 copies of the final report will be sent to TxDOT-ENV (20
of which to be forwarded to the THC) to satisfy those conditions of the permit. All
portions of the proposed APE that could not be accessed due to lack of ROE that still
require survey will be relegated to a later survey and investigated under a different Texas
Antiquities Code permit. This scope of work does not include any site testing or data
recovery, which would be conducted under an additional scope and budget.
