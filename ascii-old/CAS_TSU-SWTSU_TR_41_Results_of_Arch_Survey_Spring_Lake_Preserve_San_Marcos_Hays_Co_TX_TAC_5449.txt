Abstract
In November and December of 2009, the Center for Archaeological Studies at Texas State
University-San Marcos performed an intensive archaeological survey of the 251-acre Spring Lake
Preserve (Preserve), in San Marcos, south central Hays County, on behalf of the City of San Marcos
(City). Because the project is an undertaking of the City, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Texas
Antiquities Code and requires an archaeological survey. This survey was performed under Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 5449, granted to Jon C. Lohse. Field work was conducted by David M.
Yelacic, who served as Project Archaeologist, Amy Benton, Josh Hamilton, Sarah Scogin, and Julian
Sitters.
The intensive archaeological survey consisted of pedestrian survey, as well as the excavation of 102
shovel tests within the Preserve. As a result of the survey, five previously unrecorded archaeological
sites were documented and two previously known sites, 41HY37 and 41HY158, were revisited. Sites
41HY468, 41HY469, and 41HY471 are historic dumps; site 41HY467 is a thin prehistoric lithic scatter
and historic house site; and 41HY470 is a prehistoric lithic scatter. Sites 41HY468 and 41HY470 are
not considered eligible for NRHP listing or SAL designation, 41HY469 and 41HY471’s eligibilities are
undetermined, and 41HY467 is considered eligible for NRHP listing and SAL designation. In all cases,
CAS recommends that the City and University avoid adversely impacting the sites as well as providing
protection against theft and vandalism. If avoidance of intact features and deposits at 41HY467 is not
possible, then additional work is recommended to offset loss of information.

Introduction

Antiquities Code (TAC). The TAC requires that
such an undertaking consider the potential impact
on any cultural resources that might be present
and that might contribute information that is
meaningful or significant to understanding the
history and/or prehistory of the State of Texas.
All archaeological work was performed under
auspices of Texas Antiquities Permit Number
5449, granted to Jon C. Lohse, Director of CAS.

This report presents the results of an
intensive, systematic archaeological survey
performed by the Center for Archaeological
Studies at Texas State University-San Marcos on
behalf of the Parks and Recreation Department of
the City of San Marcos (City). The City plans to
modify and develop a 3.72-mile-long trail system
in the 251-acre Spring Lake Preserve (Preserve),
which is partially owned by the City of San
Marcos and Texas State University. The trail
system development will involve the renovation
of some extant trails as well as the creation of
new trailway.

Cultural resources located on land owned or
controlled by the State of Texas, or its political
subdivisions, are protected by the TAC (Texas
Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter
191), which identifies significant sites as State
Archaeological Landmarks (SALs). Rules of
Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code
of Texas (Chapter 26), as defined by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), is explicit about
perception and protection of cultural resources
located on State owned or controlled land:

According to the City’s plans, the Preserve’s
trail system will include 450 linear feet of
existing road to be used as trail, 4555 total linear
feet of new crushed limestone trail, 650 linear
feet of new primitive trail, and 14,000 linear feet
of existing primitive trail that will remain for
use (Figure 1). Existing parking facilities will
service this recreation area. Direct impacts will
be limited as a result of the heavy reliance on
existing trails and by placing a crushed limestone
surface directly over the ground in other areas.
However, indirect impacts to the Preserve can be
foreseen by the increase in pedestrian traffic that
will result from the conversion of this area into
a public recreation facility for the City, and also
as park-goers may occasionally wander off trails,
potentially disturbing cultural resources that are
present. As a result of potential indirect impacts,
an archaeological survey of entire 251-acre
Preserve is necessary. An inventory describing
the location and current condition of site will
assist the City in managing and protecting
cultural resources that may be present.

. . . archeological sites and historic
structures on lands belonging to state agencies
or political
subdivisions of the State of Texas
are State Archeological Landmarks or may be
eligible to be designated as landmarks. . . . The
State of Texas considers that all publicly owned
archeological sites and historic structures have
some intrinsic historic value, and the Antiquities
Code provides some level of protection for
those sites or structures regardless of their size,
character, or ability
to currently yield data
that will contribute important information on the
history or prehistory of Texas. . . . (26.2).
As all cultural resources located in, on,
or under State owned or controlled land are
considered SALs, and not all cultural resources
are appropriately designated as such or directly
threatened by development, the THC has criteria
for practically assessing the significance and/or

As a political subdivision of the State of
Texas, development of property by the City of
San Marcos falls under the purview of the Texas

(1) the site has the potential to contribute
to a better understanding of the prehistory and/
or
history of Texas by the addition of new
and important information;

Project Area Setting
The project area is located in the City of
San Marcos, in Hays County, Texas (Figure 2).
The Spring Lake Preserve is located along the
base of the Balcones Escarpment, a transitional
zone between the rolling Blackland Prairies to
the east and the adjacent Edwards Plateau to the
west, and partially along Sink Creek (Figure 3).
Ecotones such as these, situated at the interface
of two adjoining environmental provinces, are
high-energy settings capable of supporting rich
diversity in terms of plant and animal species
(Crumley 1994). Accordingly, these settings

(2) the site’s archeological deposits and the
artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or
preservation interests of the site;
(3) the site possesses unique or rare attributes
concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
(4) the study of the site offers the opportunity
to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new
scientific knowledge;
(5) the high likelihood that
vandalism and relic collecting has
occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is
needed to insure maximum legal
protection, or alternatively
further investigation are needed to
mitigate the effects of vandalism
and relic collecting when
the site cannot be protected.
Under formatting standards
set forth by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA) and
adopted by the THC, this report
provides a brief overview of the
regulatory requirements for this
project, defines the project area
setting, describes the methods
used in gathering data, and
presents the results of the survey.

are also likely areas for historic and prehistoric
human occupation. Brief descriptions of the
project area in terms of geology and soils, climate
and weather, and flora and fauna are important
for consideration and will be followed by a brief
culture history of the region as well as previous
archaeological investigations in the vicinity.

18.3 m) and is composed of
calcareous and gypsiferous clays
interrupted by thin lenses or
beds of siltstone and limestone,
while Georgetown Formation
is a 10-45 ft (3.0-13.7 m) thick
deposit of mostly fine grained
to nodular limestone with some
soft calcareous shale. Edwards
Limestone covers a great area
of Texas, however, in the project
area, it approaches 400 feet
(<121.9 m) in thickness and
ranges from massive to thinly
bedded nearly-pure calcareous
to dolomitic deposits with chert
nodules and thin cherty strata
(Bureau of Economic Geology
1974; Sellards et al. 1932).

Soils of this area are described by Batte
(1984). Because the project area lies across the
face of the escarpment and includes upland,
sloping areas as well as low-lying areas, soils
range from shallow and virtually non-existent to
moderately deep. The project area itself is covered
by several soil types. Along sloping faces of the
escarpment are Medlin-Eckrant association, hilly
(MED). Medlin and Eckrant soils are found on
lower and upper side slopes, respectively. Medlin
soils has a grayish brown surface that averages
around 28 cm (11 inches) deep, while Eckrant
soil extends as deep as 40 cm (16 inches). Both
soils are well-draining, and both have high rock
contents. Medlin soils often have subsoils of
dense, compact clay that reaches as deep as 125
cm (50 inches). Eckrant soils commonly overlie
broken, uneven bedrock. On the tops of hilly areas
is the Comfort-Rock outcrop complex (CrD).
The Comfort-Rock complex consists of shallow,
clayey soils (Comfort soils) and rock outcrops on
side slopes and hill and ridge tops. Comfort soil
is typically dark brown, with a stony clay surface

Geology and Soils
Due to the project area’s location along the
Balcones Escarpment/fault zone, underlying,
bedrock geology in the project area is complex
and consists of Eagle Ford Group and Buda
Limestone Undivided (Keb), Del Rio Clay
and Georgetown Formation Undivided (Kdg),
and Edwards Limestone (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1974). Eagle Ford Group is composed
of shale and limestone, with an upper stratum
of shale approximately 10 ft (3.0 m) thick, a 4-5ft (1.2-1.5 m) thick sandy and flaggy limestone
middle stratum, and a lower stratum composed
of calcareous shale approaching 7 ft (2.1 m) in
thickness. Buda Limestone is a massive, fine
grained, poorly bedded to nodular deposit.
Del Rio Clay has a thickness of 40-60 ft (12.24

layer of approximately 17 cm (approximately
seven inches) in thickness overlying a subsoil of
approximately 30 cm (12 inches ) in thickness.
Eckrant-Rock outcrop (ErG) consists of
combinations of Eckrant soils and rock outcrops,
and occurs on upland landscapes.

scrubs (Ellis et al. 1995). Mesquite, post oak, and
blackjack oak interrupt grasslands composed of
little and big bluestem, Indiangrass, switch grass,
sideoats grama, hairy grama, tall dropseed, silver
bluestem and Texas wintergrass on the Blackland
Prairie, and live oak, shinnery oak, junipers,
and mesquite compose the overstory while
switchgrass, bluestems, gramas, Indiangrass,
wildrye, curly mesquite, and buffalograss make
up the understory on the Edwards Plateau (Gould
1962). As Described by Blair (1950), typical
modern fauna of the region include white-tailed
deer, eastern cottontail, raccoon, opossum, and
badger as well as myriad other species.

Climate and Weather
Based on a thirty-year record (1951-1980),
summers have mean maximum temperatures
approaching 97° F, and winters have mean
minimum temperatures near 40° F in Hays
County (Bomar 1983). December and January are
the only two months in recorded history that have
not had temperatures above 90° F, while freezing
temperatures have been recorded between October
and April. The mean annual precipitation recorded
for Hays County is 33.75 inches. Precipitation in
the county is bimodal, with most precipitation
occurring in the late spring and in the early fall
(Dixon 2000; Tyler 1996). Weather in southeastCentral Texas is dynamic and often dramatically
marked by severe events. Hazardous weather is
not uncommon in the region. The Hill Country,
in general, has a serious threat of flash floods due
to thin soils and steep slopes. Cloud bursts may
unload a relatively high amount of precipitation
on a confined area in a short period of time,
resulting in the area’s tributaries and river levels
to rise rapidly (Woodruff 1979). At the other end
of the spectrum, drought is also a common feature
of Central Texas’ weather; there is not a decade
in the twentieth century that did not experience
drought conditions (Bomar 1983:153).

Cultural History
Overall, the Central Texas area is known
for its rich and diverse archaeological resources,
especially in major river valleys such as the
San Marcos River (Collins 2004). The cultural
chronologies for Central and South Texas are not
completely understood or agreed upon. However,
archaeological deposits indicate rich cultural
development spanning several millennia. Black
(1995), Hester (1995, 2004), and Collins (1995,
2004) have recently synthesized available
archaeological evidence from the region. All
dates are in the radiocarbon time scale and given
as years before present (BP, i.e. before 1950).
Human presence is divided into three periods:
Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic.

Prehistoric
The Prehistoric period is divided into three
major temporal stages, the Paleoindian, Archaic
and Late Prehistoric. The Paleoindian stage
begins with the earliest known human occupation
of North America and extends to approximately
8800 BP. The Archaic stage follows, extending
from ca. 8800 BP to 1250 BP. The Late Prehistoric
stage begins ca. 1250 BP and is characterized by

Flora and Fauna
As the location of the site is ecotonal, floral
and faunal characteristics of both the Edwards
Plateau and the Blackland Prairie are present.
The region’s natural vegetation is generally a
grassland-woodland-shrubland mosaic, where
grasslands separate patches of woody plants and

Periods due to the presence of notched projectile
points and burned-rock cooking features.

Paleoindian

Archaic

Collins (1995:381–385, 2004) dates the
Paleoindian period in Central Texas to 11,5008800 BP; we divide the Paleoindian into Early
(11,500-ca. 10,200 BP) and Late (~10,200-8800
BP) phases. Early Paleoindian artifacts are
associated with the Clovis and Folsom cultures
and diagnostic items include fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. Clovis is also characterized by
well-made prismatic blades (Collins 1995; Green
1964). The Early Paleoindian stage is generally
characterized by nomadic cultures that relied
heavily on hunting large game animals (Black
1989); however, recent research suggests that
early Paleoindian subsistence patterns were
considerably more diverse than previously
thought, and included reliance on local fauna
including turtles (Black 1989; Bousman et al.
2004; Collins and Brown 2000; Hester 1983;
Lemke and Timperley 2008). Folsom cultures
are considered to be specialized bison hunters,
as inferred from the geographic location and
artifactual composition of sites (Collins 1995).

Collins (1995, 2004) contends the Archaic
stage in Central Texas lasted approximately 7500
years, from 8800-1200/1300 BP, and divides
the stage into Early, Middle and Late Archaic
based on Weir’s (1976) chronology. The Archaic
stage marks several important transitions: a shift
in hunting focus from Pleistocene megafauna
to smaller animals; the increased use of plant
food resources and use of ground stones in
food processing; increased implementation of
stone cooking technology; increased use of
organic materials for tool manufacturing and
an increase in the number and variety of lithic
tools for wood working; the predominance of
corner- and side-notch projectile points; greater
population stability and less residential mobility;
and systematic burial of the dead. What appears
as a new emphasis on organic materials in tool
technologies and diet is most likely merely a
reflection of preservation bias.

Early Archaic
While Collins (1995:383, 2004) argues that
the Early Archaic spans from 8800 to 6000 BP
based on three divisions of projectile point types,
the current project considers the Early Archaic to
extend from 8800 to 5800 BP based on Collins
(1995) and Prewitt (1981). Significant changes
in lithic technology, seen through notched
projectile points and specialized tools (e.g. Clear
Fork and Guadalupe bifaces), as well as a dietary
adjustment, as evidenced by the increased
number of ground stone artifacts and burned
rock midden cooking features, distinguish this
cultural period from previous ones (Collins 1995;
Turner and Hester 1993:246–256). A variable
climate and concomitant variation in game
resources (i.e. bison, Dillehay 1974) are strongly
related to shift in subsistence, and Collins (1995)

The Late Paleoindian stage occurs from
ca.10,200-8800 BP. Reliable evidence for these
dates was recovered from the Wilson-Leonard
site, north of Austin (Bousman et al. 2004;
Collins 1998). At Wilson-Leonard, archaeologists
excavated an occupation known as Wilson, named
for the unique corner-notched projectile point. The
dense occupation also included a human burial
(Bousman et al. 2004; Collins 1998). In addition
to the Wilson occupation, Golondrina-Barber
and St. Mary’s Hall components, dating between
9500 and 8800 BP, were excavated. Collins (1995)
suggests the Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St.
Mary’s Hall components represent a transitional
period between the Paleoindian and Archaic

suggests that Early Archaic peoples occupied the
wetter portions of the Edwards Plateau. Early
Archaic sites are thinly dispersed and are seen
across a wide area of Texas and northern Mexico
(Weir 1976); however, Collins (1995:383) notes
a concentration of Early Archaic components
along the southeastern margins of the Edwards
Plateau, close to major spring localities such as
in San Marcos.

resource-rich environments of Central Texas
were extensively utilized (Story 1985:40; Weir
1976:125, 128).

Late Archaic
The Central Texas Late Archaic dates to
approximately 4000-1250 BP (Collins 1995:384,
2004). The Late Archaic, according to Johnson
and Goode (1994), is marked by two significant
cultural traits: 1) the billet thinning of bifacial
knives and projectile points leapt forward in
terms of artistry and technology, and 2) the
human population appears to have increased.
These patterns vary considerably through time
and from one sub-region to another across Central
Texas, but strongly shape the archaeological
record of the Late Archaic. Overall, evidence
suggests an increasingly mesic climate through
the Late Archaic (Collins 1995; Johnson and
Goode 1994; Mauldin et al. n.d.). Mauldin et al.
(n.d.) suggest that climatic variation resulted in a
general decrease in grassland bison range. Some
archaeologists note the presence of cemeteries
at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981) and
Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) as evidence that
populations indeed increased and that groups
were becoming territorial (Story 1985:44–45);
however, some other archaeologists challenge the
interpretation of a growing population by citing
a decrease in burned rock middens (Prewitt
1981:80–81).

Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic, defined by Collins
(1995, 2004) as 6000 to 4000 BP, is approximately
marked by the onset of the Altithermal. As noted
above, climate fluctuated from arid to mesic to
arid in Central Texas during the Altithermal.
Vegetation and wildlife regimes all fluctuated
in response to these environmental oscillations,
with human groups responding accordingly.
Collins (1995) divides the Middle Archaic period
by projectile point style intervals: Bell-AndiceCalf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan and Travis. The
Bell-Andice-Calf Creek interval was a mesic
period when grasslands, attractive to bison
herds, expanded southwards into Central and
South Texas. Bell-Andice-Calf Creek peoples,
as evidenced by hunting-based lithic technology,
were specialized bison hunters who followed the
herds southwards (Johnson and Goode 1994).
As the period shifted from mesic to arid, both
bison and bison hunters retreated northwards.
During this transitional period, Taylor bifaces
were manufactured. Later in the Middle Archaic,
Taylor bifaces were replaced by Nolan and Travis
points (Collins 1995, 2004). The Nolan-Travis
interval was a period when temperature and
aridity were at their greatest levels. Prehistoric
inhabitants acclimated to peak aridity as seen
through increased utilization of xerophytes such
as sotol (Johnson and Goode 1994). These plants
were typically baked in earth ovens and reflected
the development of burned rock middens. During
more arid episodes, the aquifer-fed streams and

Late Prehistoric
Collins (1995, 2004) dates the Late Prehistoric
in Central Texas at 1,300/1,200–260 BP, and
follows Kelley (1947) in dividing it into Austin
and Toyah phases. The current project delimits the
Austin phase to 1250-750 BP and the Toyah phase
to 750-300 BP. The most distinctive changes in
relation to previous eras include a technological
shift away from the dart and atlatl to the bow
and arrow, and the approximately concurrent

7

1985:45–47).

is partly responsible for what they identify as
a change in Toyah hunting strategy, involving
increasingly logistically-organized hunting forays
in pursuit of spatially dispersed herds. Based on
the ratio of zooarchaeological to archaebotanical
data associated with types of sites (e.g. bulk plant
processing, bulk meat processing, residential),
Dering (2008) provides further evidence of
Toyah phase logistically-oriented subsistence
strategies and broad diet breadths. Included with
logistical subsistence strategies was what appears
to be either trade for horticultural products not
produced in Central Texas, or of low instensity,
localized horticultural practices. Both scenarios
involve maize, which is exceedingly uncommon
in Toyah-period archaeological contexts in
Central Texas but which has been reported
from at least three locales, the Kyle Rockshelter
(41HI1) in Hill County (Jelks 1962), Bear Branch
(41CA13) in Callahan County (Adams 2002), and
the Timmeron Rockshleter (41HY95) in Hays
County (Harris 1985).

Austin Phase
The Austin phase is characterized primarily
by the appearance of arrow points, including
Scallorn and Edwards types. Evidence for
increasing social strife, if not overall populations,
is seen multiple burials from Central Texas that
date to this period. Burials from this time reveal
numerous incidents of arrow-wound deaths,
suggesting that population growth resulted in
disputes over limited resource availability (Black
1989; Meissner 1991; Prewitt 1974). Burned rock
middens are occasionally found with these types
of points (Houk and Lohse 1993), and ground
and pecked stone tools, used for plant food
processing, become increasingly common in the
Austin phase.

Toyah Phase
The beginning of the Toyah phase (750 BP)
in Central Texas is characterized by contracting
stem points with flaring, barbed shoulders, a style
known as Perdiz; by the common occurrence of
blade technology that is considered to be part of
a specialized Toyah bison hunting and processing
toolkit (Black and McGraw 1985; Huebner 1991;
Ricklis 1994); and by the appearance of bonetempered pottery in Central Texas (Johnson
1994:241–281). The wide variety of ceramic
styles and influences seen throughout Toyah
phase ceramic assemblages provide important
information concerning the social composition of
these cultural groups (Arnn 2005). Toyah phase
ceramic assemblages display Caddo, Texas Gulf
Coast, and Jornada Mogollon influences (Arnn
2005). In addition to shifts in material technology,
Mauldin et al. (n.d.) suggest that bison herds

at least partly in response to climatic patterns

Protohistoric (Spanish Entrada
Period)
In Texas, the Protohistoric period, also known
as the Spanish Entrada period, was marked by
Spanish entradas, the formal expeditions from
established forts and missions in Northern Mexico
into Central, Coastal, and East Texas in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.
These encounters began with the venture into
Texas by the Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
and the Narvaez expedition in 1528. The period
is generally dated between 1500 and 1700 (or
1528, the date of the Cabeza de Vaca/Narvaez
expedition, to the establishment of the first
Spanish mission, Mission San Antonio de Valero
in 1718).
With Alonso de León’s expedition of 1680, El
Camino Real (the King’s Road) was established
from Villa Santiago de la Monclova in Mexico
8

to East Texas. This roadway followed established
Native American trade routes and trails and
became a vital link between Mission San Juan
Bautista in Northern Mexico and the Spanish
settlement of Los Adaes in East Texas (McGraw
et al. 1991).

this period is gained through the written records
of the early Spanish missionaries. Besides the
mission town of San Antonio, the only other
Spanish settlement in the region was San Marcos
de Neve, established in 1808, four miles south of
present day San Marcos. San Marcos de Neve was
abandoned in 1812 as a result of constant raids
by local tribes (Dobie 1932). During this time,
massive depopulation occurred among the Native
Americans, mostly due to European diseases to
which the indigenous people had little resistance.
Those few indigenous people remaining were
nearly all displaced to reservations by the mid1850s (Fisher 1998).

Spanish priests accompanying entradas
provided the most complete information of
indigenous cultures of early Texas. Those
documented during the early entradas include the
Cantona, Muruam, Payaya, Sana, and Yojuane,
who were settled around the springs at San Marcos
and described as semi-nomadic bands. Other
tribes encountered at San Marcos included mobile
hunting parties from villages in South and West
Texas, such as Catequeza, Cayanaaya, Chalome,
Cibolo, and Jumano, who were heading for bison
hunting grounds in the Blackland Prairies (Foster
1995:265–289; Johnson and Campbell 1992;
Newcomb 1993). Later groups migrated into the
region and displaced the former groups or tribes.
These included the Tonkawa from Oklahoma and
Lipan and Comanche from the Plains (Campbell
and Campbell 1985; Dunn 1911; Newcomb 1961,
1993).

European presence in the region increased
as settlers received land grants from the Mexican
government until 1835. Settlement was difficult,
however, due to continuation of hostilities with
and raids by Native American tribes. The Texas
Rangers provided protection from these conflicts
after Texas secured independence from Mexico
in 1836. Settlement in the region increased until
1845, when Texas gained admission to the United
States, resulting in the formation of Hays County
in 1848 (Bousman and Nickels 2003).

Historical Landowners of Spring Lake
Preserve

Archaeological sites dated to this period
often contain a mix of both European imported
goods, such as metal objects and glass beads, and
traditional Native American artifacts, such as
manufactured stone tools.

The following information is compiled
from two archival investigations carried out
in conjunction with investigations of 41HY37
by Godwin et al. (2000) and by Bousman and
Nichols (2003). Juan Martin de Veramendi, a
native of San Antonio and a governor of the State
of Coahuila y Texas under Mexican rule, received
a land grant of two leagues in the area that is
now San Marcos in 1831. Upon his death, his
holdings were inherited by his daughter, Maria
Josepha Veramendi Garza. Another landholder
in the area, Thomas Jefferson Chambers, also
received land grants in the San Marcos area
from the Mexican Government for his service as

Historic
Spanish settlement in Central Texas first
occurred in San Antonio with the establishment
of Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo)
in 1718, and the later founding of San Antonio
de Béxar (Bolton 1970; Habig 1977; de la Teja
1995). Some researchers demarcate the transition
in Texas between the Entrada (Protohistoric) and
Historic periods by the construction of the first
Spanish missions in Texas. Most knowledge of

Surveyor General of Coahuila y Texas. Maria and
her husband, as well as Jefferson, sold portions
of their land in the San Marcos area to William
Lindsey and Nathaniel Lewis. General Edward
Burleson acquired from Lewis the portion of land
surrounding the San Marcos Springs. A short
time later, Dr. Eli T. Merriman, who was recruited
by Burleson, acquired land where Texas State
University-San Marcos is now located. Together,
Burleson, Merriman, and Lindsey founded the
town of San Marcos.

Burleson built the first dam and gristmill on the
San Marcos River, and also the first schoolhouse
in San Marcos, which was erected on a hill
top near his home. To better serve the budding
community, the schoolhouse was later moved
down the hill to a location nearer the river.
When Burleson died in 1851, his holdings were
distributed among his survivors. In the latter
half of the nineteenth-century, the Burleson land
was exchanged several times, but it commonly
remained farm or range land.

The Spring Lake Preserve is situated on
land that was once predominantly owned by
the Burleson Family. General Burleson built
his homestead on the Balcones Escarpment
overlooking the San Marcos Springs in 1848, as
depicted in an 1881 birds-eye-view illustration of
San Marcos by August Koch (Figure 4). Shortly
after building his home (recorded as site 41HY37),

Following
Burleson’s
agricultural
development of the land near Sink Creek and
the San Marcos Springs, the Riverhead farms
operated in the early twentieth-century, and the
Bridge farms also operated in the early twentiethcentury for a decade. In 1927, the Bridges sold
their land to the Westheimer family of Houston.
The Westheimers lived in a house overlooking
10

the Sink Creek valley until approximately 1942.
At that time Bert Brown, who went on to found
the Brown School, began leasing the land from
Mrs. Westheimer until 1952, when the land was
deeded to him. The Brown School is in operation
today, and is located adjacent to the eastern
portion of the Preserve. Although it is clear that
many people once owned and worked the land
that now constitutes the Spring Lake Preserve,
the families that occupied the land, aside from
the Burlesons and Westheimers, are unknown.

component of 41HY37 above the escarpment is,
or was, horizontally extensive, possibly greater
than 400 m east to west by 200 m north to south.
The cultural deposits, however, were very thin,
limited by the depth of soil atop bedrock (Garber
and Orloff 1984). In 1999, backhoe trenching at
the base of the escarpment revealed considerably
deeper artifact bearing sediments (Arnn and
Kibler 1999). While temporally diagnostic
artifacts recovered during field school and later
backhoe trenching indicated that 41HY37 was
occupied during the Middle to Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric periods, alluvial deposits at
the base of the escarpment have the potential to
contain cultural deposits spanning much of the
Holocene (Arnn and Kibler 1999; Garber and
Orloff 1984).

Previous Archaeological
Investigations
Sites located adjacent to Spring Lake have
been investigated by archaeologists for decades,
and known deposits span from Clovis (ca. 11,000
BC) to Historic Periods. Some of these sites have
been investigated by field schools carried out by
the Department of Anthropology at Texas State
University-San Marcos, though these results
remain incompletely reported to date.

Site 41HY158 was recorded and described by
Brown (1981) as a thin upland lithic scatter on a
heavily disturbed hilltop. At the time the site was
recorded, the area around this scatter appeared to
have been adversely impacted by the dumping of
a large amount of historic and modern detritus.
This site was recorded as part of a larger survey
conducted in advance of the construction of a
hilltop substation; site records indicate that the
boundaries of the site were not mapped beyond
the proposed limit of the substation, and it is
possible that prehistoric remain extend beyond
the area indicated on the Texas Archeological
Site Atlas.

Two previously recorded sites are located
immediately adjacent to or in the Spring Lake
Preserve, 41HY37 and 41HY158. Located just
outside of but adjacent to the Preserve is the
original location of the homestead of General
Edward Burleson, a component of 41HY37
(Bousman and Nickels 2003). Site 41HY37
also consists of a prehistoric component, which
extends into the current project’s area of potential
effect (APE). General Burleson was one of San
Marcos’ original residents, and an early leader
in founding the community. Because of the
historical significance of this individual, the site
is listed as a State Archaeological Landmark and
is afforded the highest degree of protection from
the State of Texas in terms of future impacts.
As investigated by a Southwest Texas State
University Field School in 1983, the prehistoric

trail system consists of a linear trail system with
minimal direct impact. According to the City’s
plans, only 3705 feet (1.13 km) of the total project
length of 19,655 feet (5.99 km) will consist of
newly constructed trailway. However, the use
of the trail system by residents of San Marcos
will result in an indirect impact on cultural
11

resources in the Preserve. The indirect impacts
of increased pedestrian traffic could potentially
include vandalism and relic collecting. Therefore,
the THC has recommended that the entire 251acre Preserve be subjected to pedestrian survey
with shovel testing. By guidelines set out by the
CTA and adopted by the THC, intensive surveys
of areas greater than 200 acres require at least
one shovel test per three acres as appropriate,
however, shovel tests are not necessary for
slopes of greater than 20 percent or areas where
bedrock is exposed. All shovel tests excavations
were evenly spaced to ensure adequate coverage,
but with special emphasis given to areas
characterized by extensive deposits. Each shovel
test was excavated to a maximum depth of 90
cm or to sterile deposits, sediment permitting,
and all excavated sediment passed through a ¼”
hardware screen. The purpose of this coverage
was to locate any buried archaeological deposits
that might be present but not visible from the
surface. The locations of all shovel tests will be
recorded by hand-held global positioning system
(GPS) and plotted on a map of the project area.
Any archaeological materials recovered during
the shovel testing were described and documented,
and then returned to the unit. Only temporally
diagnostic artifacts were collected; these artifacts
will be prepared for permanent
curation at the Center for
Archaeological Studies, Texas
State University-San Marcos.
All excavations were backfilled
upon completion.
In addition to the search for
unrecorded cultural deposits,
CAS revisited the previously
recorded sites, 41HY37 and
41HY158, in order to assess
their current conditions and
to ensure that potentially
significant deposits or remains

are not present that were initially missed or
went unrecognized. A Site Update Form was
filled out for each site and placed on file at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the
University of Texas at Austin.

Results
Generally, the topography within the preserve
is highly variable and was a determining factor for
shovel test locations. Much of the park is dissected
by deeply incised streams, and the slopes from
ridges down to streams expose bedrock in many
places. These slopes and bedrock exposures
make up an area of approximately 119 acres, or
approximately 47 percent of the 251-acre Preserve
(Figure 5). Nonetheless, all of the Preserve’s
terrain was covered by pedestrian survey, and
102 shovel tests were excavated. Shovel tests were
concentrated on stable landforms (i.e., ridge tops
and terraces) and at archaeological sites known
previous to or discovered during this survey.
Given that stable features on the landscape
have a higher probability of containing and
preserving archaeological deposits, investigation
of these landforms was aimed at identifying and
delineating archaeological deposits. Shovel tests

adjacent private property. At the
base of the knoll are vestiges of
a semi-circular two-track road,
from which four to five other
two-track roads radiate into the
park. One path, not clearly a
two-track, leads from the base
of the knoll to a small clearing at
the top (Figure 7). On the north
and south edges of the clearing,
there are piles of sediment and
decaying woody vegetation.
The age of these piles is unclear.
Vegetation on the knoll consists
of short grasses and trees,
including but not limited to oak,
hackberry, and cedar. Generally,
the surface visibility of the
knoll is greater than 40 percent,
obscured by leaf litter and short grass. The
knoll’s base, beyond the semi-circular two-track,
is surrounded by a ring of cacti, and beyond
cacti, the ridge is heavily wooded with cedar.
There is a low amount of animal burrowing on
the knoll, and there are clear signs that park-goers
visit the landform (i.e., stacked or aligned pebbles
and cobbles and modern refuse). Prehistoric
and historic components of 41HY467 will be
described and discussed separately below.

were excavated at higher rates in these settings
than what is minimally required by guidelines,
especially where archaeological deposits were
encountered.
Previously undocumented archaeological
sites encountered and recorded during this survey
include three historic dump sites (41HY468,
41HY469, and 41HY471), one prehistoric lithic
procurement site (41HY470), and one site
with both prehistoric and historic components
(41HY467). Descriptions of these five sites, as
well as reassessments of 41HY37 and 41HY158,
are to follow.

Prehistoric Component
The prehistoric component at 41HY467
consists of a relatively thin scatter of lithic
artifacts across the knoll top and south on to the
adjoining ridge. Prehistoric cultural material
was observed on and below the surface, with
a maximum depth of approximately 20 cm. Of
the 16 shovel tests excavated at 41HY467, five
encountered prehistoric material. None of the
observed lithic artifacts were diagnostic of
particular cultural periods. The relative paucity
of prehistoric artifacts suggests a short-term
occupation of the knoll during prehistory.

41HY467
Site 41HY467 consists of prehistoric and
historical components, and it spans what appears
to be the highest point of a flat-topped ridge
between Sink Creek and Aquarena Springs in
the eastern portion of the Preserve, a knoll of
approximately 30,000 m2 (200-by-150 m) (Figure
6). A portion of the knoll extends beyond the
park boundary, and it is unknown whether or
not the archaeological deposits continue into the
13

Prehistoric Artifacts

sherds, and one light scatter of machine-made
bricks (See Figure 6). Due to the type of historic
artifacts and features observed, and described
below, it appears that this was once the location
of a house site.

Artifacts associated with the prehistoric
component of the site consist only of lithic
debitage. A shovel test on the eastern portion of the
knoll yielded a small (less than two centimeters
in diameter) bifacially worked piece of chert
from just below the surface. Another shovel
test, excavated into a square-shaped depression
near the center of the knoll, encountered a flake
within the top 20 cm of excavation. The debitage
observed were relatively small (less than three
centimeters length/diameter) chert flakes lacking
cortex, and to varying degrees, all lithic artifacts
were patinated. Again, no diagnostic prehistoric
artifacts were encountered.

Cultural Features
A rock-lined cistern is located on the
north end of the knoll (Figure 8). This feature
is approximately three meters in diameter
and extends an unknown depth into bedrock.
Currently the pit is approximately a meter deep
and is filled with limestone cobbles. Beginning at
this depth, the circular walls of the pit are faced
with stacked limestone cobbles; facing cobbles
from the upper meter or so have collapsed and
in-filled the opening. A single shovel test was
excavated into the pit, encountering many of
these large cobbles. This probe was terminated at
90 cm and recovered no artifacts. It did, however,
expose lower courses of stacked facing cobbles.
Once cleared, these stones indicate that the walls
of the pit expand outwards with depth, indicating
the bell-shaped form of the cistern. Other than
the fact that upper courses of facing stones
have collapsed, this feature is intact and is well
preserved.

Historic Component
The historic component of 41HY468 consists
of both features and artifacts scattered across the
knoll and adjoining ridge top. Most of the artifacts
observed were present on the surface, however,
three of the 16 shovel tests excavated contained a
low amount of historic material. In the clearing,
one shovel test encountered historic artifacts
as deep as 40 cm below surface. Distribution
of artifacts and features across the landscape
revealed no glaring patterns. On the surface of
the knoll, however, there are two relatively large
amorphous clusters of tabular limestone cobbles,
one small amorphous concentration of glass

On the western portion of the knoll,
approximately 50 m southwest of the cistern,
14

test was excavated to a depth of approximately
55 cm below surface when bedrock or a large,
impenetrable limestone rock was encountered.
Limestone cobbles were present throughout the
excavation. This shovel test was excavated at
least 15 cm deeper than other shovel tests across
the knoll, second only to the shovel test excavated
within the cistern. In the first level of the shovel
test, 0-20 cm, one flake was recovered. This flake
was approximately three centimeters in length
and had a very low amount of cortex. It could
not be determined whether this depression has
cultural affiliation or not.
On the flat ridge top below and adjacent
to the north of the knoll, there is a linear rock
alignment and several associated rock piles. The
rock alignment is approximately one meter wide,
approaches 30 cm in height, extends for at least
50 m, and is composed of limestone cobbles
and boulders. The rock piles associated with the
alignment are composed of the same materials,
are approximately one meter in diameter, and
are slightly taller than the alignment. The rock
alignment and associated rock piles predate a
two-track road that originates at the knoll, as
evidenced by the road crossing over the rocks.
The rock alignment likely represents a historical
boundary between tracts of land owned by
different people; these people, or families, remain
anonymous.

Historic Artifacts
Historic artifacts present on the surface
are oxidized metal barrel hoops, pan, bucket,
buckle, and other miscellaneous metal fragments
(Figure 9); amethyst, aqua, brown, olive,
and colorless bottle glass sherds (Figure 10);
ceramic sherds (Figure 11); one shell button; and
machine-made bricks, two of which are stamped
with the manufacturer’s name, “VALDEZ
LAREDO” (Figure 12). Laredo was a center of
brick production along the Rio Grande River

there is a square-shaped depression in the surface.
This possible feature was investigated through
the excavation of a single shovel test. The shovel

during the late nineteenth- and early twentiethcenturies, and Valdez was the surname of at least
two artisanal brick makers in Laredo as early as
the 1880s (Cook 1998). All of the bricks observed
are a light yellowish color, which is indicative of
their use/function as construction materials made
to withstand high levels of heat (Kelly and Kelly
1977). Additionally, a piece of stoneware was
recovered with a partial maker’s mark identified
as belonging to the Pioneer Pottery Company,
which formed in Wellsville, Ohio in 1885 (Figure
13)(Barber 2001). This particular mark was
printed on white granite pieces until 1896 when
the Wellsville Pioneer Pottery Company formed
and began producing semi-porcelain stamped
with a different maker’s mark. Amethyst, aqua,

and olive sherds of glass observed at 41HY467
are colors characteristic of glass production from
the late nineteenth- to early twentieth-centuries.
Historic material was predominately observed on
the surface, however, one shovel test excavated
approximately three meters east of the rock-lined
cistern yielded a small sherd of whiteware in the
top 20 cm.

Conclusions and Recommendations
The prehistoric component of 41HY467 is a
thin scatter of lithic artifacts across the knoll and
adjoining ridge top. There is no distinct pattern
or distribution of lithic artifacts, and none of
the material can be identified as belonging to a
particular cultural period. As it is, the prehistoric

16

41HY468
Site 41HY468 is a historic dump, approximately
900 m2 in area (20-by-45 m), situated at the base
of a slope adjacent to an unnamed drainage in
the south eastern portion of the park. The site’s
boundary was delimited by the extent of the
surficial artifact scatter. Limestone bedrock
is exposed on the slope, and weathering of the
bedrock has resulted in a scatter of limestone
cobbles on the surface in the vicinity of the site.
The unnamed drainage in this portion of the park
has created a hummocky and eroded surface with
several shallow channels. Due to outcropped
bedrock, limestone cobbles, and a profile exposure
showing little soil development, investigation of
41HY468 was limited to pedestrian survey and
surface collection. Vegetation in the vicinity of the
scattered cultural material consists of scattered
ground cover, cedar, and ash juniper, and surface
visibility is in excess of 50 percent, only obscured
by leaf litter and ground cover (Figure 14). The

component of the site does not appear to be
significant to our understanding of Central Texas’
prehistory, and it is therefore recommended
to be ineligible for NRHP listing and SAL
designation.
The historic component of 41HY467 consists
of features and artifacts that indicate a house
site or related structure on top of the knoll
and adjoining ridge. The late nineteenth- to
early twentieth-century age range of many of
the artifacts places the earliest demonstrable
occupation of the site during early years of San
Marcos’ history (ca. 1880s to 1920s). Given
these factors, CAS recommends that 41HY467 is
eligible for listing on the NRHP and designation
as a SAL. As the knoll has been proposed as
the future location of a scenic overlook with
interpretive map, wildlife observation station,
and night-time outdoor classroom (See Figure
1), it is important to understand the potential
adverse impacts on the site. CAS recommends
that plans for development be drawn in a way to
avoid impacting intact features and deposits. If
avoidance of intact features and deposits is not
possible, further work would be necessary to
offset a loss of information.

jars and bottles, rubber hose, and ceramic conduit
are evidence that dumping continued through the
twentieth-century.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Site 41HY468 is relatively small in size and
is confined to the surface on a less than stable
landform, albeit the cultural material appears
to be in “primary” context and not to have been
deposited by a flood event. There is no apparent

Cultural Materials
Historic artifacts present at 41HY468 include
sherds of amethyst glass, aqua glass, and brown
glass; sherds of whiteware; and fragments of
metal cans, pans, and buckets. One brown bottle
base fragment has the maker’s mark of William
Franzen & Son, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, dating
to the early twentieth-century (ca. 1900-1929)
(Toulouse 1971). William Franzen & Son’s
commonly made bottles for local, Milwaukee,
brewers. A clear bottle base fragment, with
light aqua coloring, is stamped with an “F,”
which is the mark of Fairmount Glass Works,
Indianapolis, Indiana and is dated ca. 1930-1945
(Toulouse 1971). The function of this bottle is
unclear. Another clear glass bottle base, with a
slight amethyst hue, represents a small square
ink bottle made by Sanford’s Ink Co. (Figure
15), which is still in business. Though this
base fragment lacks the rings at the neck base
diagnostic of early Sanford’s Ink bottles, it is
likely that the specimen was produced in the
early to mid twentieth-century (Lindsey 2010).

Figure 15. Sanford’s Ink bottle base from 41HY468.

In addition to these three identifiable bottle
base fragments, many more mold-blown and
machine-made amethyst, aqua, dark olive, and
milk glass sherds indicate earliest use of the
locale as a dump in the early twentieth-century
(Figure 16). Fragments of whiteware appear to
be ironstone china. Although no maker’s mark
is present, one fragment of a whiteware cup has
a portion of a bird a flower decal (Figure 16).
Decals were introduced as ceramic decoration
in the mid nineteenth-century, providing the
earliest possible date for this artifact. Modern

base of a slope (Figure 17), the top of which is
the Preserve’s boundary with a residential area.
Exposed limestone bedrock has weathered
and eroded, leaving cobbles on the surface. An
ephemeral drainage adjacent to the site exposes
shallow bedrock (i.e., less than 10 cm), shows a
lack of soil development in profile, and mobilizes
artifacts, as indicated by sherds of glass within
the small channel located tens of meters away
from the site. Given the thin nature of sediments
at 41HY469 and instability of the landform, the
site was investigated through pedestrian survey
and surface collection. Vegetation in this area is
predominantly oak, and a low amount of ground
cover and leaf litter provide greater than 40 percent
surface visibility. The site consists of domestic
debris including sherds ceramics, sherds of glass,
and fragments of oxidized metal. There are no
cultural features associated with 41HY469.
Figure 17. Photograph upslope showing scatter of
historical debris at 41HY469 (facing northwest).

Cultural Material
Many of the ceramic and glass artifacts noted
at the site can be dated. Sherds of glass include
very dark olive (light black), olive, amethyst,
milk glass, and colorless vessel fragments (Figure
18). Very dark olive, sometimes also referred to
as “light” black, glass was commonly used to
contain alcoholic beverages until the end of the
nineteenth century (Lindsey 2010). Similarly, the
manufacture of olive colored bottles for general
use was common until the turn of the twentiethcentury, however, bottles made for some liquor,
wine, and champagne continue to be made with
olive color glass. Amethyst colored glass is the
byproduct of manganese dioxide exposed to UV
light over time. Manganese dioxide was commonly
used to neutralize the natural color of glass (e.g.,
create the appearance of clear glass) between the
1880s and WWI (ca. 1915). Milk glass, or opaque
white/cream colored glass, was commonly used for
medicine, cosmetic, toiletry, food, and specialty
items between the end of the nineteenth-century
and the mid twentieth-century (Lindsey 2010).

meaningful pattern to the artifacts, and the
site contains no cultural features. The site also
contains a relatively high amount of modern
debris. Given these factors, CAS archaeologists
consider 41HY468 not to be eligible for listing
to the NRHP nor worthy of inclusion as a SAL.
However, 41HY468 should be protected from
potential pedestrian traffic and subsequent
potential looting, theft or removal of its contents,
and vandalism.

41HY469
Site 41HY469 is a historic dump located
approximately 65 m to the west of 41HY468
and situated along the same drainage system.
The site is also located approximately 250
m north of the Edward Burleson Homestead
(41HY37) and approximately 150 m west of a
cement slab foundation. Site 41HY469 occupies
an area of approximately 900 m2 on and at the
19

to the American Bottling Co. of Chicago, IL and
is dated 1905-1916 (Toulouse 1971). Another
sherd has “FRANCO-AMERICAN / HYGIENIC
CO. CHICAGO” embossed on the bottom (See
Figure 15, bottom center). The Franco-American
Hygienic Co. manufactured toiletries beginning
in 1889 (Currey 1918). The amethyst hue of this
base sherd indicates an age range of 1889 to WWI
(ca. 1915) (Lindsey 2010). A milk glass jar base
fragment has “__DINOLA CREAM / EXION
BEAUTIFIER” embossed on its bottom (See
Figure 18). One last artifact with manufacturer
information is a large (approximately 15-by-25
cm), oxidized cast iron metal fragment with raised
grape leaf motif and words “__CH & CO / __
OUIS” on its front (Figure 20). On the backside of
this metal fragment, raised letters read “G S 21.”
It is probable that this is a fragment of a cast iron
stove or heater manufactured by Bridge, Beach
& Co. of St. Louis, MO. Although the company
began making cast iron stoves much earlier, it
manufactured products under the name Bridge,
Beach & Co. St. Louis from 1857 to 1879 (Black
1902). The age range of manufacture for the cast

time at which this piece was discarded.

Given the age ranges of the glass colors present
at the site, it appears that the site represents a late
nineteenth- to early twentieth-century deposit of
historic debris. Some artifacts with manufacturer
information corroborate the estimated age of this
site while also contributing information about
the possible function of the artifacts before they
were discarded. One is a stoneware bottle base
sherd with “P & J. Arnold / London / England”
stamped on the body (Figure 19). This bottle
fragment is from a master’s ink bottle, which
was used for refilling desktop inkwells, dating to
the last half of the nineteenth century (Lindsey
2010). Four other artifacts are base sherds of glass
vessels that have maker’s marks or manufacturer
information. Two of the sherds have “A B Co”
embossed on the base. This maker’s mark belongs

Conclusions and Recommendations
Site 41HY469 is a historic dump containing
material that dates from the mid and late

short grasses, and trees including cedar, oak, and
hackberry. Site 41HY470’s area, approximately
2800 m2 (~70-by-40 m), was delineated by the
extent of surface scatter and shovel tests devoid
of cultural material. A total of seven shovel
tests, two of which contained cultural material,
were excavated at 41HY470. Cultural material is
primarily scattered atop the surface of the terrace,
however, a low amount of cultural material was
observed in the first level (0-20 cmbs) of shovel
test excavations. No cultural features were
observed above or below surface.

nineteenth-century to the early-twentieth
century. One of the artifacts, a master’s ink bottle
base sherd, may indicate the dump’s association
with San Marcos’ first schoolhouse, which was
built by Edward Burleson on a hill top near his
house, later moved down the hill closer to the
river, but never recorded as an archaeological site
(Bousman and Nichols 2003). However, further
work is necessary in order to positively identify
this association. If 41HY469 and the yet-recorded
schoolhouse are related, then 41HY469 could be
eligible for NRHP listing and SAL designation. At
present, however, the site’s NRHP eligibility and
SAL worthiness are unknown. CAS recommends
that the City avoid this site during the construction
of the trail system, and protect it from vandalism
or impact from use of the Preserve trail system.

Artifacts at 41HY470, including tested
cobbles, lithic debitage, a large biface, and a multifaceted core, are present on and below the surface.
A single biface that measured approximately
17 cm long by 10 cm wide was observed on the
surface (Figure 21). This specimen is composed
of relatively coarse-grained chert, it has cortex
present on both broad faces, and it is interpreted
as an early stage biface. Also observed on the
surface was a core measuring approximately 15
cm in diameter (Figure 21). The core is composed
of relatively fine-grained chert, and it has three
distinguishable platform surfaces. Neither
the biface nor the core is characteristic of any
particular cultural or time period. Other artifacts
present on the surface were flakes, with and
without cortex, and tested cobbles; many, but not
all, of the artifacts observed on the surface are
patinated. In addition to the surficial artifacts,
two shovel tests yielded chert flakes (i.e., less than
3 cm diameter) as deep as 15 cm below surface.
Both of these shovel tests were excavated to
approximately 60 cm below the surface, where
clayey subsoil was encountered. Modern human
presence at the site is indicated by a barbed wire
fence running perpendicular (north-south) to
Sink Creek and a modern aluminum beer can. A
trail that is still in use is located approximately 50

41HY470
Site 41HY470 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
situated on a terrace of Sink Creek’s right bank
in the north central portion of the Preserve. The
terrace is bound to the north by a slope to the
channel of Sink Creek and to the south by a slope
to a terrace approximately three meters higher
in elevation. It appears that the source of chert
used for stone tool manufacture is eroding out
of the slope between terraces. Vegetation in the
vicinity of the site is composed of patchy cacti,

domestic items scattered without
patterning across the surface
(Figure 22). Approximately 15 m
south of the site is a transmission
line and clearing/two track road
running east-west, and skirting
the east side of the site is another
two-track road that runs from
the transmission line to the edge
of the ridge. From the south, the
ridge slopes at 5-10 percent until
the shoulder, at which point the
slope increases dramatically and
limestone bedrock is exposed.
Bedrock also outcrops in the
vicinity of the site, and has
contributed an abundance of
limestone cobbles present on
the surface. A single shovel test

Conclusions and Recommendations
Site 41HY470 is a relatively light and shallow
scatter of lithic artifacts across an area of
approximately 2700 m2 on the right bank terrace
overlooking Sink Creek in the north central portion
of the Preserve. None of the cultural materials
observed are characteristic of a particular cultural
or time period, and the site does not appear
to contain intact or extensive buried deposits
capable of contributing to the understanding of
local or regional history or prehistory. Given
these factors, it is recommended that the site not
be considered eligible for NRHP listing or SAL
designation, and that no further investigations are
necessary. However, CAS recommends that the
City protect the site by ensuring Preserve visitors
do not remove artifacts present here.

18 cm below surface and was devoid of cultural
material. Vegetation on this portion of the ridge is
predominantly cedar and other trees, patchy cacti,

greater than 40 percent at 41HY471. Site 41HY471
covers an area of approximately 600 m2 (~20by-30 m) and is defined by the extent of historic
artifacts present on the surface.

Cultural Materials
Historic artifacts present at
41HY471 include fragmentary
and whole colorless glass
bottles, milk glass bottles, and
brown glass bottles; oxidized
metal cans, pans, wire nails,
and
miscellaneous
metal
fragments; and other domestic
debris including a rubber toy car
and leather shoe soles. Several
bottles contained information,
embossed
manufacturer’s
marks, that provide insight to the
artifacts’ use (Figure 23).
Two bottles have OwensIllinois Glass Co. maker’s
marks that can be traced back
to manufacturing plants in Gas
City, IN (ca. 1929-1954) and
Terre Haute, IN (ca. 1930s-1950)
(Toulouse 1971). Another bottle
has the maker’s mark of the Knox
Glass Bottle Co. of Mississippi,
Jackson, MI, the use of which
can be dated ca. 1932-1953. A
catsup bottle, as indicated by
shape, has the Hazel-Atlas Glass

bottle with embossing reads across one side of
the body, “GEBHARDT EAGLE,” and across the
opposite side, “CHILI POWDER.” This bottle
has no maker’s mark, but it is clear that the bottle
once contained chili powder manufactured by
Gebhardt Eagle, which began in the 1930s. Two
other bottles, without any type of identifying
marks, have horizontal ribs up their bodies. This
feature is characteristic of pepper bottles, though
is not characteristic of a period of time. One last
bottle with embossing, which cannot be traced to
a manufacturer or maker, reads “ROUX.” This

hill behind Aquarena Springs Inn (now the Texas
Rivers Center) and on the easterly adjacent hill
overlooking the golf course, by W. L. McClure
in 1970. In 1979, a historic component including
General Burleson’s home was added to 41HY37
by Joel Shiner. The Burleson home was once
located on the hill behind Aquarena Springs Inn.
A Southwest Texas State University Archaeology
Field School, directed by James F. Garber in
1983, investigated the prehistoric component of
the site on the eastern hill overlooking the golf
course. During this field school, one 1-by-2 m
and seven 1-by-1 m test units were excavated
to shallow bedrock. Projectile points recovered
from the surface and test units represented
time spanning the Middle Archaic to the Late
Prehistoric, however, a relatively low amount of
artifacts suggested that “. . . the site was not used
extensively for habitation or lithic manufacture”
(Garber and Orloff 1984). A portion of 41HY37,
as well as many other sites in the vicinity of
Spring Lake, was revisited by Arnn and Kibler
(1999) of Prewitt and Associates, Inc. preceding
the construction of a under ground water line.
Five backhoe trenches excavated along the base
of the escarpment yielded a number of artifacts
in colluvial (i.e., slope-washed) sediments. As a
result, the boundary of 41HY37 was extended to
the base of the escarpment.

Another artifact that provides information
about the history of 41HY471 is a rubber toy car
(Figure 24). This toy was manufactured by the
Sun Rubber Company of Barberton, OH (ca.
1930s-1940s). Although the rubber is now black
and deteriorating, it was once brightly colored.

Conclusions and Recommendations
The deposit of historical domestic debris
that constitutes 41HY471 appears to date to the
first half of the twentieth-century. The material
is likely associated with a house site that is just
beyond the southern boundary of the Preserve
on this ridge. This locality has not been recorded
as an archaeological site, and it is unclear
whether or not it is eligible for NRHP listing
or SAL designation. If this house site is eligible
and 41HY471 is indeed associated with it, then
41HY471 could be considered significant. In any
event, regardless of whether the eligibility status
of the unrecorded house site can be established at
this point, CAS recommends that site 41HY471
be protected from theft and vandalism once the
Spring Lake Preserve trail system is completed.

41HY37
Site 41HY37, a SAL, was initially recorded as
a prehistoric site of unknown age, located on the

survey, were employed to investigate 41HY37.

41HY37 during construction of the trail system
for the Preserve.

41HY158
When 41HY158 was recorded in 1981, it
consisted of lithic debitage scattered thinly
across a flat hill top. The area around this scatter
appeared to have been adversely impacted by
the dumping of a large amount of historic and
modern detritus. Archaeological survey of this
hill top preceded the construction of a LCRA
substation, and since that time, the substation
has been erected. According to an illustration of
the site, the site boundary was almost completely
within the substation’s footprint, just outside of
the Preserve boundary. Pedestrian survey and
two shovel tests excavated in the vicinity of the
site, but within Preserve boundaries, confirmed
the absence of prehistoric lithic material and the
presence of a high amount of modern refuse.

Cultural Vestiges
No shovel test yielded cultural material,
however, a low amount of patinated lithic
debitage was observed on the surface. All of the
lithic artifacts were small chert flakes or flaked
chert cobbles, none of which are characteristic of
particular cultural or time periods. Additionally,
a relatively high amount of modern debris,
including plastic, paper, aluminum cans,
miscellaneous pieces of metal, glass bottles, and
golf balls, was present on the hill, especially near
the golf course. At the top of the hill, there is a
large cleared area with many distinct piles of
rubble, trash, and biomass from Spring Lake. It
is not clear how long this refuse area has existed.
Other evidence of modern, or relatively recent,
disturbance includes two unimproved roads, one
leading to the refuse area and the other to the
concrete slab foundation briefly discussed with
site 41HY468. These roads have existed since
at least 1983 (Garber and Orloff 1984), and it
appears that the road leading to the concrete slab
foundation will be the beginning of the Preserve
trail system (See Figure 1).

Conclusions and Recommendations
It appears that no portion of 41HY158 exists
within the Preserve boundary. As such, CAS
recommends that the City may proceed with
development in this portion of the Preserve,
however, if future undertakings threaten
41HY158, action should be taken as necessary.

Summary and
Recommendations

Conclusions and Recommendations
Within the Preserve boundary, 41HY37 is
a thin, prehistoric artifact scatter representing a
specialized activity zone during the Middle and
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric. Investigations
of the site for the current project corroborate
Garber’s 1983 observations of a relative paucity
of artifacts. However, as 41HY37 is a SAL, it
should continue to receive the highest amount
of protection available from the State of Texas.
CAS recommends that the City avoid impacting

The City plans to modify and develop a 3.72mile-long trail system in the 251-acre Spring
Lake Preserve, which is partially owned by the
City of San Marcos and Texas State University.
The trail system development will involve the
renovation of some extant trails as well as the
creation of new trailway. As this development
will use State funds, it is subject to compliance
with the Antiquities Code of Texas. Accordingly,
CAS conducted an intensive archaeological
25

survey of the 251-acre Preserve, which included
the excavation of 102 shovel tests and resulted
in the discovery of five previously unrecorded
archaeological sites.

yet-unrecorded historic house site, respectively.
In all cases, CAS recommends that the City
protect the sites from developmental impact and
potential theft and vandalism. If sites 41HY469
and 41HY471 can not be avoided during the
development of the proposed trail system, then
additional work is recommended to ascertain
whether these deposits are indeed associated
with significant early historical events and/or
personages in San Marcos. If so, these sites may
then be considered SAL-eligible, and further
research may be necessary to offset the loss of
important information they potentially contain.

Site 41HY467 is composed of a thin
prehistoric lithic scatter and possible historic
house site on a knoll and adjoining ridge top
along the eastern boundary of the Preserve. CAS
recommends that the prehistoric component not
be considered eligible for NRHP listing or SAL
designation. However, CAS recommends that the
historic component is eligible for NRHP listing
and SAL designation because of the fact that it
contains datable materials that demonstrate its
association with the period of early San Marcos
settlement, and because it contains demonstrably
intact features and deposits. CAS recommends
that these intact features and deposits be avoided
as the locality is developed in conjunction with
the City’s plans, but that areas of the site that
have been shown to be devoid of deposits may
be impacted without concern for the loss of any
significant information that the site may contain.

Site 41HY470 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
on the right bank terrace above Sink Creek in
the central portion of the Preserve. The site does
not appear to have the potential to contribute to
understanding local or regional prehistory, and
therefore, does not appear eligible for NRHP
listing or SAL designation. Nonetheless, CAS
recommends that the City take action to protect
the site from theft and vandalism.
In addition to these five previously unrecorded
archaeological sites, CAS archaeologists revisited
a portion of 41HY37, a SAL, and 41HY158. Results
of investigations at 41HY37 were consistent with
previous investigations, and as the site has been
designated a SAL, it should continue to receive
protection under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Investigations of 41HY158 confirmed that the site
is not present within Preserve boundaries.

Sites 41HY468, 41HY469, and 41HY471
are historic dumps containing high amounts of
glass, ceramics, and oxidized metal fragments.
Site 41HY468 is not eligible for NRHP listing or
SAL designation, whereas the eligibility of sites
41HY469 and 41HY471 is currently unknown and
dependent upon their unique associations with
either the first schoolhouse in San Marcos and a
