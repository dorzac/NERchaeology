APPENDIX G

Cistern One Glass

Nancy BoJce

INTRODUCTION
The Cistern One collection of bottles and jars consists of 34 whole
specimens,

65 necks,

68 bases,

and a number of glass sherds. The

classification system is based on artifact function. It includes the following
categories: snuff bottles, wine and spirit bottles, beer bottles, soda/mineral
water bottles, panel and patent medicine bottles, pharmaceutical bottles,
and bottles with various or unknown uses. The jars were placed into two
categories: plain jars and lids; fruit jars and lids. After the remaining glass
sherds were sorted by color and excavation level, they were weighed.
Artifact descriptions were kept to a minimum. They read from the bottom
of the artifact upward to the rim. Rim types are illustrated (Fig. 1) rather than
described. Measurements refer to the overall height of the artifact, the width
if it is square or rectangular (measured at the greatest distance across the
base), the diameter if it is round; also given is the inside diameter of the
mouth.

ARTIFACTS
BOTTLES
Snuff Bottles
GARRETT SNUFF BOTTLES
Number of specimens: 15 (3 complete bottles, 6 rims, and 6 bases representing at least
9 bottles)
Provenience: 300(4), 301, 302(7), 303(2), 304
Description: Amber colored, square base, straight sides curving inward to the rim, no
neck, rim type S. Measurements: 99 mm high, 60 mm wide, 24.5 mm inside diameter
of mouth (Fig. 2).
Discussion: Two, three, or four dots in various patterns occur on the bases of these bottles.
"These dots do not indicate the strength of the contents but are only maker’s marks of
piece work bottle blowers" (Vaughan, 1971). The use of snuff appears to have been a
commonly accepted practice. "In the early 30s and later the use of snuff was quite
general. It was not bad form to indulge in it. Snuff was sold in grocery stores and by
druggists as well as at many taverns" (Van Rensselaer, 1926:36). These bottles could
have been the property of Charlie Johns’ mother as she was a known snuff user.
Wine and Spirits Bottles
OLIVE GREEN WINE BOTTLE
Number of specimens: 2
Provenience: 302(2)
Description: Circular base with a 35 mm deep concave kick up bottom, sides tapering
outward to the shoulder, neck tapering inward to rim type W. Measurements: 253 mm

Boice -- Cistern One Glass

high, 71 mm diameter, 17 mm inside diameter of mouth (Fig. 3).
Discussion: Kick up bottoms are formed when a pointed rod pushes the semifluid glass
center upward in the base. "Late 19th century bottle bottoms have low kick-ups or
none at all except for champagnes or other spirits that require strong resistance
against internal pressure to prevent breakage" (Freeman, 1964:491).

Description: Glass sherds in six colors weighing 7.43 kg.

PRESSED GLASS
Pressed glass is defined as glass with sharply defined, impressed patterns
on the exterior and a smooth interior surface (Lorrain, 1968:38). It is made
by pressing hot glass into piece molds. The pressing machine was patented
in 1827; however, it was not until the 1940’s that pressed glass was produced in large quantities (Lorrain, 1968:39). It commonly was found in most
households, but "was never what you would call an aristocratic product with
a pedigree worth preserving" (Lee, 1946:vii).
Whole specimens were not recovered from the excavations. Specimens
are fire polished with a smooth finish. Some colored glass is present, but
none of the patterns can be identified. This situation indicates a late date,
approximately 1900-1930. Classification is based on vessel form. Patterns
are very briefly described as none are well known. There are four vessel
forms represented: bowls, bowl lids, goblets, and stems.

Bowls
SHALLOW BOWL
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: 303
Description: Clear, shallow bowl with flattened rim, 37 mm high. Pattern consists of "S"
curves in a circular pattern on the base, with circles on the rim.
SMALL BOWL
Number of specimens: 8 (one bowl)
Provenience: 302(3), 303(5)
Description: Clear, shallow, small dish with scalloped rim; 42 mm high, 103 mm
diameter. Pattern consists of geometric interlocking circles (Fig. 34).
