Animal Remains
by DESSAX,IAE LOKRAn’~
The animal remains found at the Gilbert Site are tabulated by
feature in Table ll. Most common were white-tailed deer, box turtle,
and turkey in that order. Those three animals were undoubtedly
the primary protein source for the Indians living at the site.
The quantity and variety of turtle remains is unusually large
when compared to the fauna found at most areheological sites in
Texas. However, the Vinson" Site in Limestone County-another site
of the Nortefio Focus-also contained numerous turtle fragments.
This possibly could be a characteristic trait of Nortefio Focus sites.
The large size of the deer bones and the presence of puma, bear,
and probably bison, which are no longer present in the area, reflect
the impoverishment of the wild faun/ after White settlement in the
mid-nineteenth century.
Following is an analysis of the deer bones from Features 3, 4, 6,
and 7, the only features from which a significant amount of bone
material was collected. Of the total bones recovered, ahnost 90go were
the remains of white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus. There were
at least 127 animals represented by 5,441 counted fragments. Deer
was obviously the major source of animal food for the people living
at the site.
This study was undertaken primarily in an attempt to determine
something of the hunting and butchering techniques and food preferences of these people. An attempt was also made to determine the
ages of the deer in order to discover the time of year they were
killed. It was thought that the ages of the animals would provide the
best clue to the time of the year that the site was occupied. The distribution of bone among the various middens was examined. It was
assumed that each midden represented the camping place of a specific
group of Indians. If this assumption is valid, any important difference
in distribution from midden to midden could have a cultural significance.
Half of the bones were washed at The University of Texas laboratolT; the other half were washed in Dallas by Mr. and Mrs. Jack
Bureh, Norma Hoffriehter, my husband Paul Lorrain, my three
children, and myself. After drying, a feature number was inked on

each bone. As there was no significant stratification of the middens,
the exact position where a bone was found within the midden was
not recorded.
After numbering, the bones were sorted to isolate the deer remains.
The latter were in turn sorted according to bone: i.e., skull, femur,
tibia, etc. The rights and lefts were separated where applicable.
Because the long bones were almost always broken, they were recorded by proximal and distal ends. After counting and recording
each bone (Table 19.), an estimate of the minimum number of animals
represented by each was made (Table 13).
For the long bones, scapulae, pelves, astragali, calcanei, naviculocuboids, and mandibles, after determining how many rights and lefts
there were of each, the largest number was taken as the minimum
number of animals. The metacarpals and metatarsals were divided by
2. The phalanges were divided by 8. The atlases, axes, and first sacral
vertebrae were counted and the rest of the vertebrae were divided by
the number found in one animal. A record was kept of the number
of certain bones with loose, partially fused, or fully fused epiphyses
(Table 14). They were recorded as partially fused if, although the
epiphysis was attached, the line between epiphysis and shaft could
be seen clearly all around the bone.
The long bones, metapodials, atlases, axes, scapulae, and pelves
were examined to determine, if possible, where they had been broken
or cut by the Indians. The breaks were then examined and recorded
to determine any consistent patterns which would indicate the
butchering techniques used (Table 15).
The tooth development was examined to determine the age of the
deer. Table 16 lists the number of teeth cut, partially cut, or missing.
In addition it shows the height of the crown on the inside of the
second posterior cusp of the first and second adult molars.
The data thus recorded were plotted on several graphs to make
them easier to visualize. Table 13 shows the minimum number of individuals represented by each bone for each of the four features
and for the combined total of all four. Taking the largest number of
individuals in each ease as 100%, the percentages of this largest
number were caleulated for the others. For example, if the distal end
of the humerus was the most common bone and if it represented 50
animals, then bone representing 25 animals would total 50~o of the
maximum number. These percentages for the total of all four features
combined are plotted in Figure 77. The percentages for each feature
are plotted separately in Figure 78. A bar graph (Figure 79) shows
the incidence of pre-adult mandibles at various stages of develop-

ment. The variation in crown height of the first molar in mandibles
with adult dentition is shown graphically in Figure 80.
The bones were disarticulated with the exception of two vertebrae
and one ca!eaneum and astragalus. During excavation, several eases
were observed of an astragalus and caleaneum in articulation, but
these were accidentally separated during the washing process and
were not recorded. In addition, all but tbJee of the long bones were
broken, presumably for their marrow. Other bones were also cracked
and broken. The sku!l in particular was usually fragmented. With
the exception of these deliberate breaks, the bones were in excellent
condition and required no special handling.
The scarcest deer bones were caudal vertebrae and antlers. The
tails undoubtedly remained with the hide when the animal was
skinned, and most of them were subsequently removed from the site
when the skins were traded for guns, metal tools, glass beads, and
other items of European manufacture. Of the few pieces of antler, two
were fashioned into artifacts: one (Fig. 75, a) a handle for some type
of tool, the other (Fig. 76) a ceremonial headdress made of the antlers
and part of the skull. Neweomb (1961: 273) reports that the deer
dance was the most important Wichita ceremony. Perhaps most of

the antlers were made into artifacts that the Indians took with them
when they left, or perhaps deer were hunted in winter after the
antlers had been shed.
There was one direct indication of the method used to kill deer.
A stone arrow point was found imbedded in the centrum of one
thoracic vertebra. The arrow came from below and to the left of
the animal’s spine. A few bones showed small conical depressions
which might have been made by buckshot. The dents, measured with
a vernier caliper, ranged from three to five millimeters in diameter.
Whatever methods the Indians used in hunting were apparently
successful. The small percentage of other animals would indicate
that they were able to obtain an abundance of their favorite foodvenison.
There were enough representative bones from each area of the
body to indicate that at least half of the deer were brought to the
site complete. Figure 77 shows this diagrammatically. It also shows
that the vertebral column and feet including metapodials are present
for less than 505~ of the animals. Some animals were probably
butchered at the kill site and only the choice cuts brought to the
village. The choice parts are the limbs, excluding metapodials and
feet, and the head. The small percentage of skulls is attributed to
their badly fragmented condition. Only in Feature 7 were reasonably
complete skulls found, and even those were broken so that all bones
anterior to the frontals were missing. There was not a complete
maxilla anywhere on the site. As a result, calculating the number of
skulls was difficult and undoubtedly the number recorded is much
too low.
After examining the breaks, the following conclusions were reached
about the methods of disjointing a deer. Starting with the head and
working back, the skull was severed by a blow in the general area
of the occipital condyle. The condyle was usually broken; 5070 of the
atlases were broken and 697oo of the axes. It looks as if the Indian
simply took a swipe at the area and cut wherever he hit. The skull
was broken to extract the brains and probably the tongue. The one
fairly complete skull from Feature 7 had a large hole in the right
temporal area. The mandibles are usually broken behind the third
molar.
Most of the forelimbs were severed through or just below the head
of the humerus. The head was often so disfigured in the process as
to make identification impossible. The graph shows only 3470 for
the proximal end of the humerus. The distal end of the humerus is
the most frequent bone. Most of these are broken about two inches

230

from the olecranon fossa. The medial portion of the humeral shaft is
usually missing. It was apparently thoroughly shattered for extraction
of the marrow.
Most of the radii were broken about midway along the shaft, as
were the ulnas. The oleeranon of the ulna is also missing in the
majority of the bones. Figure 81 shows the probable direction of the
blows used in butchering the forelimb.
The scapulae most often were broken above the glenoid fossaquite far above as a rule-in an area where the scapulae are fragile
and could have broken accidentally.
The hind limbs were usually separated from the body by cutting
into the joint between the pelvis and the femur. There were three
distinet types of pelvic breakage observed, as shown in Figure 81.
The femora were broken badly at both ends. The number of proximal ends is 21~g below the number of pelves. The recognizable ones
are broken close to the head. There are even fewer remains of the
distal ends. Apparently the limb was disjointed by breaking through
the knee joint, thus disfiguring both the distal end of the femur and
the proximal end of the tibia. Although those two are among the last
epiphyses to fuse, the diaphyses alone are readily recognizable.
There are 34% more distal ends of tibiae than proximal ends. Most
of them include a considerable part of the shaft. The distal half of
the tibia shaft is very thick-walled and contains a negligible amount
of marrow.
The metacarpals and metatarsals are broken about midpoint of
the shaft. Most of the carpals and tarsals are complete as are the
phalanges. None seem to have been utilized in any way, and they
were probably just removed and discarded.
A few of the bones showed evidence of having been cut with
metal knives.
One of the questions asked about the Gilbert Site was whether
it was a permanent village or a seasonal hunting camp. The lack of
house remains and burials and the meager evidence of agriculture
suggested the latter. In an attempt to help settle this question, the
tooth development and the fusion of the epiphyses were exmnined
closely in an effort to learn the age of the animals. Studies of the
development of deer teeth with age have been made, but previous
studies on epiphyseal fusion in relation to deer age were not found.

Harlow and De Foot (1962) give for the same age classes more
detailed information on how far the eruption of each molar has
progressed. In addition they give the premolar replacement sequence
and show the degree of wear of the permanent teeth for deer up

Tooth development of pre-adult deer mandibles.

The mandibles from Gilbert represent several stages of development which are shown in Figure 79. A full square on the graph
represents a tooth that is cut, and a half square represents a tooth
that is partially cut. Fifteen individuals do not have their full adnlt
dentition. In order to estimate the age of a deer at the time it was
killed, it is assumed that the fawns were dropped in May or June.
The youngest animal is represented by one tiny jaw with the milk
teeth barely showing. This was probably an unborn but ahnost
fully developed fawn. It would indicate a kill in the spring of the

year. There is a considerable lapse in time before the next stage.
This is a jaw with all three milk molars and one molar cut and the
second molar cutting. This indicates an animal killed during its first
winter. Next is a jaw with the second molar fully cut, which would
be an animal about a year old, killed in the spring. The next stage
is shown by six jaws which are cutting the third molar. These represent animals killed during the late summer or early autumn of their
second year. There is a jaw with the third premolar just starting
to cut which indicates a deer late in its second autumn. Lastly is the
jaw with the first premolar cutting. This is a deer in its second
winter. The other four immature jaws were broken in such a way
that the season could not be determined.
Most of the animals had full adult dentition. To get a rough idea
of the age range of these fully grown animals, the height of the
crown on the lingual surface of the second posterior cusp of the first
and second molars was measured. If the diets and rate of wear are
similar for deer in Florida and those from Gilbert, the majority of
the Gilbert deer were killed between 1,~’ and 3,~ years of age. Their
teeth were quite sharp and showed little wear. The Indians apparently preferred young but fully grown animals, as indeed would
we. There are a few jaws, however, which have teeth showing different amounts of wear including some worn down to the gum line.
There must have been animals ahnost 10 years old.

Methods of butchering deer forelimb and pelvis.

One of the methods used to determine the age at death of human
skeletons is to examine the epiphyses to discover whieh have o1"
have not fused. The ages at whieh various human epiphyses become fused has been studied and reeorded. However, I was unable to find any similar studies on deer epiphyses. The Gilbel"c deer
bones from Features 3 and 7 were examined for fusion of the
epiphyses anyhow, and the data are presented in Table 14.
In order to discover if any significant variation existed in the distribution of bone among the four features studied, the pereentages
of bone in each feature were plotted in Figure 78. The agreement is
generally quite good and the differenees eould be due to accidents
of preservation or eolleetion with the exception of the low percentage
of hind limb bones from Feature 4. That feature also returned a
higher percentage of animals other than deer, espeeially bison or
cow. The people living there could have had enough of a taste for
bison to go some distanee to hunt them, or they may have had cattle.
At the time this site was oeeupied either animal was obtainable and
no distinguishing bones were reeovered. In any event they were a
bit more fastidious about their venison and used more of the forelimb
than the hindlimb. I have been told by deer hunters that the forelimb is "better eating." The rest of the site is homogeneous as far
as distribution of the deer bones is concerned.
The following eonelusions about the Gilbert Site are based on the
analysis of the bone scraps from Features 3, 4, 6, and 7. The emphasis

234

is on deer, but the fact that there was a small percentage of other
animals is taken into consideration.
1. The main source of animal protein for the people at the Gilbert
Site during the historic occupation was white-tailed deer.
2. The only weapon demonstrated by the study of the bone was
the bow and arrow. No lead balls or shot were found which would
indicate definitely the use of guns.
3. Approximately half of the deer were brought into camp whole;
the other half were butchered elsewhere and the choice cutsheads and limbs minus feet-were brought home.
4. The head was severed in the general area of the oecipital condyle,
atlas, and axis. The skull and mandibles were broken to remove the
brains and tongue. The forelimb was removed by cutting the head
of the humerus. It was further separated by cutting just above the
olecranon fossa of the humerus and midway along the shaft of the
radius. The hindlimb was removed by cutting the acetabulum of the
pelvis and the head of the femur. It was divided further by cutting
through the knee joint. The shafts of all the limb bones were broken
to extract the marrow. The shafts of the humerus and femur, which
would have the most marrow, were the most shattered.
5. The site was occupied all year. The teeth show two animals
killed in the spring, two in the winter, six in the late summer or
early autumn, and one in the late autumn. The small amount of
antler is attributed to its use for ornaments and tools rather than to
the antlers having been shed.
6. With respect to butchering data the site is culturally homogeneous, with the exception that Feature 4 had a lower percentage
of the hindlimbs of deer and more remains of other animals.
