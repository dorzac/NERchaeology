ABSTRACT
Between March 27 and April 4, 2007, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton &
Associates) conducted a testing program at archeological site 41PK248 at the request of Comstock Oil
and Gas, Inc. (Comstock) on a portion of the Alabama-Coushatta Indian Reservation (ACIR) in eastcentral Polk County, Texas. Investigations were conducted to determine the site’s eligibility for inclusion
in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Site 41PK248 was originally located by the 2006
archeological survey of the proposed ACIR #9 well-pad location performed by Blanton & Associates
(Willis and Young 2006). Shovel testing on the site revealed buried cultural materials, including
diagnostic projectile points and prehistoric ceramics. As a result, Blanton & Associates recommended the
site for more intensive investigation to make a determination regarding its research potential and NRHP
eligibility.
Investigations complied with Sections 106 and 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended (PL-96-515). Permits were issued to Blanton & Associates, under case number SPRO-BA-06027 for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Cultural Resource Use Permit #209-2920-06-A for the
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Archeological Resource Protection Act (ARPA) permit number
SPRO-ARPA-07-001.
The results of the project found that all cultural material recovered at this site are dispersed through some
1.40 meters of homogeneous sands with no clear stratigraphic breaks. Thus, the isolation of discrete
cultural components was impossible. Field observations, coupled with results from the optically
stimulated luminescence analyses, indicate that artifacts at this site are buried primarily by postdepositional pedoturbation. This situation effectively precludes the potential to discover intact cultural
features or activity zones. Due to the observed pedoturbation and the geomorphic setting of the site, it is
the opinion of Blanton & Associates that further investigations at 41PK248 would not have a high
potential to discover intact cultural features or living surfaces. Blanton & Associates recommends that site
41PK248 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and the proposed construction of ACIR Well #9
should be allowed to proceed as planned without additional cultural resource investigations.
The Alabama-Coushatta Tribe requested that all artifacts recovered from the excavations be returned to
them, so none of the materials collected during this project will be curated.

INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of Phase II archeological testing conducted by Blanton & Associates, Inc.
(Blanton & Associates) on behalf of Comstock Oil and Gas (Comstock) on site 41PK248 within the
Alabama-Coushatta Indian Reservation (ACIR) approximately nine miles east of the City of Livingston in
Polk County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). Excavations for this project occurred between March 27 and
April 4, 2007. Test excavations were conducted to determine the site’s eligibility for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Site 41PK248 was originally located by the 2006 archeological survey of the proposed ACIR #9 well-pad
location performed by Blanton & Associates (Willis and Young 2006). Shovel testing on the site revealed
buried cultural materials, including diagnostic projectile points and prehistoric ceramics that suggested
the site potentially represented a single component pre-Caddo Mossy Grove Tradition (ca. 500 B.C. to
A.D. 700) occupation or a late Mossy Grove occupation with evidence of early Caddoan ceramics. As the
Mossy Grove Tradition is relatively poorly defined, the site potentially offered new and important data
concerning this period, as well as possibly providing information on the Mossy Grove/early Caddo
interaction or relationships. Given those conditions, Blanton & Associates recommended the site for more
intensive investigation to make a determination regarding its research potential and NRHP eligibility prior
to the destruction of the site by Comstock’s proposed ACIR #9 well pad.
In order to determine the site’s research value and potential significance, test excavations focused
primarily on determining the integrity of the cultural deposit at 41PK248, with secondary concerns being
cultural chronology and technology. To assess the horizontal and vertical integrity of the deposit at
41PK248, the testing phase began with limited backhoe trenching. These trenches provide a summary
geoarchaeological assessment of the site and adjacent sediments, with additional geoarchaeological
evaluation occurring during the excavation of test units. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)
analysis, in conjunction with geoarchaeological data, the vertical provenience of diagnostic and nondiagnostic artifacts, and chronometric data recovered from the site were employed to address the above
issues.
The Alabama-Coushatta Tribe requested that all artifacts recovered from the excavations be returned to
them therefore none of the materials collected during this project were curated. All field, analysis, and
laboratory records are on file at Blanton & Associates’ office in Austin, Texas. Supervisory personnel
included Principal Investigator Mark Willis and Project Archeologist Michael Wilder who is also the
primary author. Joe Sanchez facilitated field excavations and conducted lithic studies. Analysis of the
ceramic assemblage recovered during testing was performed by Dr. Timothy K. Perttula. OSL dating was
conducted by Dr. Steven L. Forman of the Luminescence Dating Research Laboratory, the University of
Illinois at Chicago. Radiocarbon samples were processed by Beta Analytic Inc.
All investigations complied with Sections 106 and 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966,
as amended (PL-96-515). The testing regime was designed to comply with methods as defined in the
Procedures for Performing Cultural Resource Fieldwork on Public Lands in the Area of New Mexico

This report was organized using the BLM recommended guidelines for archeological testing reports that
can be found in Manual Supplement H-8100-1 (BLM 2005). The Background section presents the
general environmental and physiographic setting of the site and also synthesizes the prehistoric and early
historic background of the project area, including previous archeological investigations. The research
design, field, and laboratory methods used during this project are presented thereafter and the Finding and
Conclusions section reports the results of the test excavations. The Recommendations section summarizes
the results of the archeological investigations and provides management recommendations for the site.

BACKGROUND
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Site 41PK248 lies within the Interior Coastal Plain sub-province of the Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Wermund 2007). This is an arbitrarily defined portion of the Coastal Plain related to ancestral
marine and deltaic deposits of the Gulf of Mexico (Sellards 1932). The overall region is characterized by
a series of parallel ridges and valleys that dip gently to the southeast toward the Gulf of Mexico. The
immediate project area along Bear Creek includes meandering stream channels, relict stream channels,
back-swamp deposits, natural levees, and point bars. The majority of site 41PK248 is located on a relict
upland knoll on the edge of the bottomlands within the Bear Creek floodplain (Figure 3). Bear Creek
effectively demarcates the northern and eastern boundaries of the site, while an intermittent tributary
stream borders the site on the south and west.

Figure 3. Photographic overview of Site 41PK248

Soils within the project area consist of fine loams and sands of the Pinetucky and Pluck-Kian soil series
(McEwan et al. 1983). These soils derived from the underlying Pleistocene-age Willis Formation, a
fluviatile deposit of unconsolidated sands and muds containing siliceous gravels of granule to pebble size,
including petrified wood.

Soils on the knoll belong to the deep, moderately well drained Pinetucky series, while the surrounding
bottomlands are characterized by Pluck-Kian soils. Both soils are moderately to strongly acid, which is
not conducive toward preservation of bone or other organic materials. Pinetucky soil is a fine sandy loam
overlying sandy clay loam subsoil. Pinetucky soils are formed on upland landforms while Pluck--Kian
soils are fine sandy loams occurring on nearly level to gently sloping terrain in floodplains. Pluck-Kian
soils are poorly drained, with slow run-off, and flooding occurs in most years (McEwan et al. 1983).
This portion of Texas falls within the Pineywoods Vegetational Area as defined by Gould (1975). It is
characterized by mixed hardwood and pine forests with an average rainfall of approximately 48 inches
distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Climatic conditions include long, hot summers, with cool
and generally short winters. Snowfall is rare (McEwan et al. 1983). This warm and moisture-rich
environment supports a lush vegetative complex. Common canopy species include water oak (Quercus
nigra), southern red oak (Q. falcata), white oak (Q. alba), winged elm (Ulmus alata), and southern
magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora). The understory includes yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria), southern wax
myrtle (Morella cerifera), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), hawthorns (Crataegus spp.), greenbriar
(Smilax spp.), and various vines, including an abundant amount of poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans).
The project area is situated in the Austroriparian Biotic Province, as described by Blair (1950). The
modern fauna of the area includes typical forest species such as white-tail deer, raccoon, coyote, feral
hog, beaver, eastern cottontail, and a variety of squirrel and rodent species. Prior to about 1850, black
bear were fairly common in the area. The region is situated in a transitional zone where tropical,
temperate and arid environments converge, and has been called the “biological crossroads of North
America” owing to the abundance of diverse species located in the region. The Big Thicket National
Preserve (Preserve) is a non-contiguous land-holding administered by the National Park Service that
protects a remnant of the complex biological diversity that once characterized the entire region. The
97,500-acre Preserve boasts 85 tree species, and nearly 1,000 varieties of flowering plants, including four
different carnivorous species. Fauna in the Preserve includes fifty different reptile species, and about 300
different bird species that either live or migrate through the area. Other species include: yellow-billed
cuckoo, wood duck, speckled king snake, pileated woodpecker, marbled salamander, gar fish, coral snake,
coyote, armadillo, roadrunner and bobcat (NPS 2007).
Other fauna which can influence the integrity of archeological deposits are fossorial animals. Fossorial
species burrow with their forelimbs, kicking loose sands upwards toward the surface, creating small
mounds near the tunnel opening (Davis and Schmidly 1994). Burrowing and digging activity by moles,
shrews, pocket gophers, various mice, and rabbits, as well worms and insects, can significantly affect
surface, near surface, and buried cultural deposits, frequently resulting in a mixture of artifacts of
different ages. Several larger burrowing species inhabit the area and are potential agents of bioturbation.
These include pocket gophers and the nine-banded armadillo. Pocket gophers create nest chambers and
food caches as deep as five to six feet below the surface, with lateral horizontal tunnels that can extend
over 100 meters. The nine-banded armadillo builds dens that vary from one to five meters in length and
extending from a few centimeters below the surface to depths as great as 1.30 meters Davis and
Schmidley (1994). In extreme cases, prolonged burrowing at a site can result in the formation of artificial
concentrations of buried artifacts. Johnson (1989) documented the formation of “stone-lines,” (once

thought to be culturally produced) through this process. Even larger species such as feral pigs, squirrels,
and foxes disturb the near surface environment through grubbing or wallowing (Waters 1992).
CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The prehistory of east Texas is generally divided into four broad cultural periods: Paleo-Indian (ca.
12,000 to 10,000 B.P.), Archaic (ca. 10,000 to, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. The following discussion
briefly summarizes the region’s culture history, as per existing syntheses and temporal frameworks
presented by Story (1990), and Patterson (1995).
The exact timing of the earliest human occupation of North America is the subject of considerable debate,
though most researchers agree that humans occupied east Texas since about 12,000 years ago. The
majority of artifacts attributable to this time period, the Paleoindian Era (ca. 12,000 to 10,000 B.P.), have
come from surficial contexts as isolated finds or mixed with artifacts from later periods and hence have
limited capacity to illuminate past life ways and cultures. It is generally agreed that these groups were
highly mobile hunters and foragers subsisting on a wide variety of plant and animal foods, including nowextinct megafauna such as the mastodon. Knowledge of Paleo-Indian artifact assemblages (and associated
cultural patterns) is severely limited by the lack of preservation of materials other than stone. Large,
lanceolate projectile points are recognized as diagnostic of the time period and include Clovis, Folsom,
Dalton, and San Patrice point types.
The Archaic stage of prehistory in Texas spans roughly 6,000 years and is generally divided into Early,
Middle, and Late periods on the basis of diagnostic projectile point types. Although there is an abundance
of sites from the Archaic throughout Texas, few are well-stratified. Many Archaic sites lack depositional
integrity and preservation of materials other than stone is exceedingly rare. Overall, the Archaic stage is
marked by a broadening of the subsistence base and increasing regionalization of point styles over time.
The addition of ground stone tools for plant processing indicates changes in cultural adaptation from the
Paleo-Indian era. Patterson (1995:252) dates the Early Archaic period from approximately 7,000 to 5,000
B.P. on the upper Texas Gulf coast. Diagnostic point styles from this time period include dart forms
found throughout central and northern Texas such as Bell/Calf Creek, Wells, and Morrill. During the
Middle Archaic projectile point styles include Bulverde, Lange, Williams and probably the Kent-Gary
types toward the latter portion of the Middle Archaic (Patterson 1995, Story 1990). The first recognizable
group cemeteries appear during this time frame, likely indicating the development and strengthening of
territorial identification by specific groups. Late Archaic point types include Gary, Kent, Darl, Ensor,
Elam, Ellis, and Fairland forms.
The Late Prehistoric in East Texas is often referred to as “Woodland,” to denote its close cultural
affiliation with more sedentary, ceramic-producing cultures throughout eastern North America. Hallmarks
of the Late Prehistoric in this portion of Texas include the introduction of ceramics and the bow and
arrow into the material culture. Based on similarities in the overall ceramic assemblage of the area, Story
(1990) defined the Mossy Grove Tradition of Southeast Texas and has suggested Early Ceramic (ca. 100
BC – AD 900) and Late Ceramic (ca. AD 900 – AD 1700) subdivisions. The Early Ceramic period is
characterized by the dominance of Goose Creek Plain pottery, a plain, un-tempered, sandy-paste ware
generally associated with Gary and Kent dart points. The Late Ceramic period is marked by the
ARCHEOLOGICAL TESTING AT SITE 41PK248 ON THE ALABAMA-COUSHATTA INDIAN RESERVATION

introduction of arrow points, grog-and-bone tempered pottery, and the presence of Caddoan ceramics,
possibly as trade wares from the Caddo heartland to the north (Story et al. 1990: 256, 258, and 275–276).
Despite the presence of these other ceramic types, Goose Creek Plain continued to dominate Late
Ceramic assemblages. The introduction of ceramics to regional material culture does not appear however,
to have been accompanied by any immediate changes in basic adaptive strategies during the Late
Prehistoric; evidence indicates a continuation of a seasonally nomadic, hunting and gathering lifestyle
exploiting a wide array of plant and animal resources. However, the presence of ceramics does indicate
contact with emerging complex cultures to the east and north where horticulture and increasing sedentism
were gradually replacing a hunting and gathering subsistence regime.
The advent of the historic era in Texas has traditionally been marked by the shipwreck of Alvar Nunez
Cabeza de Vaca in 1528, although it is unlikely that de Vaca traveled as far east as the project area. The
remnants of the DeSoto entrada led by Luis Moscoso entered what is now northeast Texas in the early
1540’s, but the expedition turned around and did not venture as far south as the project area (Bruseth and
Kenmotsu 1993). Although neither of these early expeditions had direct contact with Native inhabitants in
this portion of Texas, the introduction of European diseases disastrously impacted Native populations and
spread far beyond areas of direct Native-European contact. Some of the larger historic-era Native
American groups within this region of southeast Texas were the Akokisa, Atakapa, and the Bidai. Historic
documentation concerning these groups indicates that the Bidai were primarily located inland in southeast
Texas, whereas the Akoksia and Atakapa spent at least part of the year on the coast (Aten 1983: 34-39).
Increasing population pressure from Euro-American settlers had ongoing and widespread impacts on
Native populations throughout the New World. As diseases decimated their numbers, various tribes
entered into larger confederacies and many fled ancestral lands seeking respite from land encroachment,
warfare, and disease. The Alabama-Coushatta tribes are one example of historic-era Native American
population movement. Originally from the area near present day Montgomery, Alabama, these tribes were
part of the Creek Confederacy and maintained close ties to early French settlers in the central Alabama
vicinity, especially after the establishment of Fort Toulouse (outside Montgomery) in 1717 (Hook 1997).
The tribes fled the region after the English established control in the late 1700’s, and came to the Big
Thicket area of Texas in the 1780’s (McEwan et al. 1983).
The Spaniards welcomed these tribes into their territory as a barrier to French and English encroachment.
For their part, the Indians were attracted to the region because the dense vegetation inhibited white
settlement, and offered excellent hunting and fishing (Shott 1993). The tribes maintained a friendly
relationship with Sam Houston and, although officially neutral, aided the Texians during the Texas War
of Independence (1835-1836). Partly as a result of their aid, the Alabama and Coushatta managed to
remain in the area, despite Governor Mirabeau B. Lamar’s policies of Indian expulsion and eradication
during the late 1830s. In 1854, the Alabama tribe received a land grant of 1,280 acres in the Big Thicket
region from the Texas legislature. The Coushattas were granted 640 acres the following year, but white
settlers on the property refused to leave, and the grant was negated. In 1859, the Alabamas officially
welcomed the Coushattas onto their reservation, and the tribes have become essentially one entity (Hook
1997). In 1928, an additional approximate 3,000 acres of land adjoining the original reservation was
authorized and the area has since been officially renamed the “Alabama-Coushatta Indian Reservation.”

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
In her comprehensive synthesis of Gulf Coastal Plain archeology in east Texas, Story notes that the
archeology of the Conroe-Livingston area is better known than other portions of Texas, due to a number
of excavations in the general area over the years (Story 1990: 274). In the 1920s, The University of Texas
conducted reconnaissance survey and excavations in the area (Pearce 1932), but only brief notes were
published concerning any of this work (Aten 1983). The earliest archeological investigation within the
Big Thicket National Preserve (BTNP) was a reconnaissance-level survey conducted by G.E. Arnold in
1940. Several sites were recorded in and adjacent to the BTNP, but the results of the survey were never
fully published.
In the 1960s, several archeological investigations were conducted in the general area in association with
reservoir construction, including at nearby Lake Livingston (Nunley 1963, McClurkan 1968). Nunley
oversaw the initial survey for the area that would become Lake Livingston, recording 40 sites.
Importantly, he also noted the presence of sandy paste ceramics associated with otherwise Archaic-like
assemblages. Suspecting that these ceramics might be among the earliest occurring in southeast Texas,
Nunley recommended three sites for intensive investigation and called for limited testing on 19 other
sites.
Between 1965 and 1966, the Texas Archeological Salvage Project and the Houston Archeological Society
conducted excavations on six sites within the impoundment area of Livingston Reservoir. In reporting
these excavations, McClurkan (1968) noted that only two periods of occupation could be discerned, the
Late Archaic (LaHarpe aspect) and Late Prehistoric. The Late Archaic was recognized by the presence of
“dart points, predominately of the contracting stem tradition”, and plain sandy paste ceramics, whereas
the Late Prehistoric occupations were associated with arrow points and decorated bone- and/or grogtempered pottery (McClurkan 1968:107–110). D.P. Hsu of the Texas State Building Commission
conducted additional survey in the Livingston Reservoir area from 1968 to 1969, but never formally
reported his findings. Story (1990: 96), in reviewing site file records at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, found records of at least 120 sites recorded through this work, primarily in Polk and San
Jacinto Counties.
During the late 1970s, a series of excavations conducted at five sites by Texas A & M University at the
Conroe Reservoir (Shafer and Baxter 1975, Shafer and Stearns 1975) resulted in the subdivision of the
Late Prehistoric into the Early Ceramic (ca. 200 B.C to A.D. 900) and Late Ceramic (ca. A.D. 900 to
1700) periods, two constructs first developed by Hoffman (1970) for the Red River basin in Arkansas.
Early Ceramic occupations are denoted by the presence of untempered plain sandy paste ceramics in
association with contracting-stem Gary dart points and early expanding-stem arrow points. Late Ceramic
sites, though still dominated by plain, sandy paste ceramics, also contain ceramics tempered with grog or
bone, as well as minor amounts of decorated wares.
In 1983, Aten published his synthesis of the aboriginal groups of the upper Texas coast and included the
Livingston area. In that area, the plain sandy paste Goose Creek Plain dominates the Early Ceramic
assemblages. This particular ceramic type is found in archeological deposits as far south as Galveston Bay
and as far north as the valleys of the Angelina and Neches Rivers (Aten 1983, Perttula 1993:106).

Although Goose Creek Plain remained a significant constituent of Late Ceramic pottery assemblages, the
later period witnessed the introduction of plain and decorated bone- and/or grog-tempered Caddoan or
Caddoan-like pottery, as well as the continued use of untempered sandy paste ceramics (i.e., Goose Creek
Incised and Goose Creek Red Filmed) (Aten 1983:293–296).
From previous efforts and her own research in southeast Texas, Story (1990:259–279) proposed the
Mossy Grove Tradition (ca. 100 B.C. to A.D. 1700) for the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods in
southeast Texas. In essence, this cultural construct is a synthesis of previous work by McClurkan (1968),
Shafer et al. (1975), and Aten (1983). The Mossy Grove Tradition encompasses the Early Ceramic (which
Story tentatively dated at ca. 100 B.C. to A.D. 900) and Late Ceramic (ca. A.D. 900 to 1700) divisions.
Story defined the Mossy Grove Tradition as a generalized “cultural pattern and…regional tradition that
partly parallels development of the Caddoan tradition to the north,” (1990:256). Representative artifact
assemblages from the early part of the tradition are plain sandy paste pottery (Goose Creek Plain)
associated with contracting-stem dart points, particularly Gary and Kent types. In late Mossy Grove
assemblages, dart points are replaced by arrow points, tempered ceramics appear with the untempered
sandy paste varieties, and Caddoan pottery is present in small quantities (Story 1990:255–292).
More recent archeological work in the vicinity has been characterized by smaller-scale cultural resource
surveys associated with development or resource extraction. Thoms (1991) performed a cultural resource
survey of 20 proposed home-site tracts on the ACIR and recorded one prehistoric lithic site and several
small historic-era artifact scatters, none of which were considered significant. In 1994, TRC Mariah
conducted an archeological survey of the proposed ACIR No. 5 well-pad area, north of SH190 and west
of Bear Creek, but discovered no cultural materials at that location (O’Neill 1995). Jackson and Dockall
(1997) surveyed 30 one-acre home-site tracts for cultural resources, but found no sites of significance and
only one artifact (a possible fire-cracked rock) that could have been attributable to the prehistoric era.
Espy, Huston, and Associates conducted a cultural resource survey of 9.2 miles of proposed transmission
line right-of-way (ROW) between the cities of Livingston and Goodrich in Polk County (Leshley et al.
1999). This survey resulted in the discovery of ten previously unrecorded archeological sites consisting
primarily of prehistoric lithic scatters of unknown cultural affiliation. Three sites (41PK200, 41PK201,
and 41PK202) were considered potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and site avoidance was
recommended. Site 41PK200 was described as a lithic scatter containing seemingly intact subsurface
deposits, while the latter two sites are ceramic and lithic scatters dating to the Late Prehistoric time period
(Leshley et al. 1999: ii and 53). These sites were avoided during the subsequent proposed construction so
no final NRHP determinations were made.
In late 1998 and early 1999, TRC Mariah surveyed 358 proposed seismic shot holes located in alluvial
settings within the ACIR (Johnson and Lintz 1999). Nine prehistoric sites spanning the mid-Archaic
through the Late Prehistoric were recorded as a result of this survey. Investigations observed that the
majority of newly discovered archeological sites were located on “slightly elevated landforms on or
adjacent to the flood plain,” (Johnson and Lintz 1999: iii). The NRHP eligibility recommendations for the
sites were undetermined as the survey-level investigations did not provide data of sufficient resolution so
all of the sites were avoided during subsequent seismic drilling.

Brown et al. (1999) surveyed 40 miles of proposed seismic lines within the Lance Rosier Unit of the
BTNP located in Hardin County southeast of site 41PK248. Those investigations discovered five new
cultural resource sites and revisited five previously recorded sites. Of these ten sites, two were recorded as
sparse prehistoric artifact scatters, while the remaining eight sites were historic in age. Brown et al.
(1999) recommended that the prehistoric sites be considered eligible for the NRHP due to the general
paucity of documented prehistoric sites in the region. However, the sites were avoided by the seismic
project so no further work was conducted on the sites and final NRHP determinations were never made.
TRC Mariah conducted a cultural resource survey of areas to be impacted by proposed road widening of
Chief Kina Loop, Bear Creek Loop, and Colabe Road (Pritchard 2001). The survey documented the
location of five Traditional Cultural Properties (TCPs) on the Alabama-Coushatta reservation. Two of
these TCPs consisted of pine needle nests associated with the Little People and were recorded off Bear
Creek Loop immediately south of 41PK248. The Little People are important mythological figures in the
Alabama-Coushatta cultural tradition. According to legend, they have been friends and allies of the
Alabama tribe since the time an Alabama hunter saved a group of them from being stung to death by
yellow-jackets (Martin 1977:84).
The most recent archeological work in the area was the survey of two proposed well-pad locations on the
ACIR by Blanton and Associates (Willis and Young 2006). This survey resulted in the discovery of site
41PK248 on the location of proposed ACIR Well No. 9. Shovel testing on the site revealed cultural
materials within a homogeneous sandy deposit, including probable Mossy Grove and Caddoan ceramics,
a Gary projectile point, and an abundance of lithic debitage (Willis and Young 2006: 8). Further
investigations were recommended in order to make a final determination on the site’s eligibility. The
additional work conducted on site 41PK248 is the subject of this report.

RESEARCH DESIGN
Test excavations at site 41PK248 were needed to determine if significant archeological deposits might be
destroyed by the proposed construction of ACIR Well #9. The management goal of the test excavations
was the assessment of the site’s significance and integrity. In assessing the site’s integrity and
significance, test excavations attempted to answer the following questions: What type of occupation(s)
does the buried deposit reflect and is the deposit significant? What are the temporal and cultural
affiliations of the deposits? Does the deposit reflect cultural change or continuity through time? Material
culture remains from testing will provide a clearer picture of site occupation and adaptive patterns
reflected at the site. Primary research themes include site stratigraphy and integrity, cultural chronology,
and cultural continuity or change exhibited in the material culture remains through time.
SITE INTEGRITY
The primary goal of Phase II testing at site 41PK248 was to recover data that would allow an assessment
of the contextual integrity of the archeological deposit and, by implication, its potential significance. The
sandy soils of East Texas are notorious for post-depositional pedoturbation resulting in mixed
archeological assemblages and the inability to isolate discrete components, severely limiting the research
value of such sites. However, even in relatively mixed sandy mantle deposits, cultural features on or cut
into the basal clays have proven to be of great value in understanding past cultural behavior. To assess
site integrity, and by implication site significance, the following issues were addressed:
Does the cultural deposit at 41PK248 represent a single or multicomponent occupation, are the cultural
materials preserved within discrete stratigraphic zones that allow researchers to assess the potential for
artifact mixing, and finally, regardless of the condition of the remains within the sandy sediments, are
there intact cultural features cut into the site’s underlying basal clay that can provide important
information concerning prehistoric adaptations?
If testing indicated that one or more of the conditions described above, i.e., a single component site, a
stratigraphically discrete multi-component site, and or recognizable and datable features etched into the
basal clay, was met at the site, the site would have been highly likely to be considered significant,
particularly if the quantity and diversity of cultural materials present paralleled those observed in the
survey shovel tests. In that case, excavations at the site could have potentially contributed new and
important information concerning the Mossy Grove Tradition and/or the relationship between Caddoan
groups and the Mossy Grove Tradition. This would have been particularly pertinent to questions
concerning changes or continuities in technology through time between the Caddo and Mossy Grove
Tradition if the site had revealed occupations related to both groups.
CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
Five temporally diagnostic artifacts were discovered during survey investigations at 41PK248—one Gary
projectile point (variety unknown), one untempered sandy paste Goose Creek Plain var. unspecified
ceramic sherd, two unidentified ceramic sherds with a red film or slip, and one ceramic sherd with bone
temper. Unfortunately, the resolution of shovel testing is not conducive to tight vertical control. This

ARCHEOLOGICAL TESTING AT SITE 41PK248 ON THE ALABAMA-COUSHATTA INDIAN RESERVATION

limited the ability to discern stratigraphy necessary to interpreting the cultural chronology. Because
untempered plain sandy paste ceramics and bone-tempered ceramics are associated with the entirety of
the pre-Caddo Mossy Grove tradition and the Caddo (Story 1990, Perttula 2006 personal communication)
and the identification of the ceramics recovered during survey was cursory and limited, a larger sample of
ceramics obtained during test excavations would assist in providing relative dates for site use.
It is posited that stylistic differences (i.e., relative thickness and overall size) within the Gary type can be
used as temporal indicators, with older varieties generally larger, thicker, and wider than later specimens
(Perttula et al. 1993:99 citing Shambach 1982:172–177). As the Gary projectile point type and its various
sub-varieties (Perttula et al. 1993:99) are associated with the early (ca. 100 B.C. to A.D. 800) Mossy
Grove tradition, the recovery of a larger sample of Gary points, would also facilitate site dating. Thus, a
larger sample of ceramic and lithic artifacts would aid in defining relationships between occupations at
the site and culture complexes of the region. Unfortunately, the use of temporally diagnostic artifacts is a
relative dating technique that provides only broad, general dates. However, when used in conjunction
with absolute dating techniques, a more precise chronology is possible.
Although much is known about Caddoan prehistory, much remains to be learned. The pre-Caddo Early
Ceramic and Southeast Texas Mossy Grove Tradition are less well known. The recovery of cultural
material and/or features from an intact context in this area could contribute greatly to our understanding
of this potential transitional area. Below are several potential scenarios that could have described the
chronological and cultural affiliation at the site:
Does site 41PK248 represent a single-component Mossy Grove site with associated Caddoan materials, a
single component Early Ceramic site with some associated Mossy Grove materials, or a multi-component
occupation exhibiting use of the area by Mossy Grove and Early Ceramic/Caddoan groups?
TECHNOLOGY AND MATERIAL CULTURE
The presence of tempered and untempered ceramics, as well as the Gary point at 41PK248, suggests that
two separate occupations may have occurred. If test excavations reveal arrow points in association with
grog-tempered pottery, then the argument for multiple occupations at the site is reinforced given their
association during the Late Mossy Grove and Middle to Late Caddoan periods (ca. A.D. 800 to 1,700) as
opposed to the association of contracting stem dart points and untempered sandy paste pottery during
early Mossy Grove (ca. 100 B.C. to A.D. 800) occupations (Story 1990).
As described previously, during the Late Mossy Grove period Caddoan or Caddoan-like ceramics appear
in the archeological record. During survey investigations at 41PK248, two unidentified ceramic sherds
with a red slip or film were uncovered. Additionally, STP 36 contained one probable bone tempered
punctuated rim sherd. Although none of these can be convincingly identified as Caddo-related, the
presence of possible Caddo materials is an intriguing possibility and must be kept in mind during the
analysis.

13

Thus, do the two red decorated sherds and the probable bone-tempered rim sherd represent Caddoan
ceramics or are the red decorated specimens actually Goose Creek Red Slipped, and could the bonetempered sherd actually be an Early Ceramic example?
If one or more discrete occupations can be discerned at 41PK248, then the patterning of lithic debitage,
formal stone tools, and concentrations of ceramics may provide insight into activity patterns within a
particular temporal period. Comparing and contrasting discrete features and/or activity areas could
provide insight into the continuity and change in terms of lithic and ceramic technologies at the site.
The production of lithic tool forms is a reductive process that results not only in a final tool but in debris
that reveals production patterns that may indicate technological limitations as well as cultural choices.
The distribution of these forms and the debris left from their production and maintenance would likely
offer insight into the corresponding distribution of activities within a campsite or living area. The test
excavations and subsequent laboratory analysis will focus on attempting to understand strategies (and
continuities and changes in the case of a multi-component site) in lithic production and use at the site by
conducting a morphological analysis of formal tools and a debitage analysis of the waste produced.
If the site were found to be stratified, these comparisons may indicate changes or continuities in
assemblages from spatially and stratigraphically discrete sets of artifacts. The appearance of a small
assemblage of formal tools and larger quantities of debitage and modified or utilized flakes might reflect a
specific kind of subsistence adaptation. Quantitative analysis will include debitage attribute analysis to
understand the stage(s) of the reduction process that was undertaken at the site. The debitage inventory
recovered during survey efforts primarily suggested secondary and tertiary reduction, as the majority of
recovered specimens were classified as tertiary and secondary flakes.
Of particular interest was the recovery of the Gary point from ST 5 (in the site center) that was
manufactured from petrified wood, as well as the recovery of six petrified wood tertiary flakes and one
secondary petrified wood flake from ST 36 in the northern end of the site.
Could the concentration of the petrified wood flakes in ST 36 (as well as the other debitage specimens)
reflect a discrete activity area?
The preponderance of secondary and tertiary flakes recovered during survey suggest that the bulk of the
initial reduction of raw materials was not undertaken on site, though the presence of the tested chert
cobble intimates that minor initial reduction likely occurred. With this in mind, it can be expected that
further evidence of secondary and tertiary reduction and finishing of tool forms will be apparent during
testing. This means that the debitage will primarily consist of secondary, tertiary, and thinning flakes
associated with the reduction of prepared cores and/or biface blanks that were roughed out at quarry
locations.
Secondary reduction activities undertaken on site were likely complemented with a significant investment
in the maintenance and refurbishing of formal tools. This means that even smaller sized debitage will be
critical in determining the extent to which tool maintenance was undertaken. The determination of the

ARCHEOLOGICAL TESTING AT SITE 41PK248 ON THE ALABAMA-COUSHATTA INDIAN RESERVATION

14

intensity of tool production versus tool maintenance undertaken at the site will be critical to
understanding how lithic tools were utilized at the site through time.
If the materials present at 41PK248 retain contextual integrity, the site has the potential to contribute
much information concerning the Mossy Grove tradition and/or the relationship between Caddoan groups
and the Mossy Grove tradition. Polk County is situated within the transition area between the Northeast
Archeological Region and the Southeast Texas Archeological Region as defined by the Texas Historic
Commission (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Temporally diagnostic artifacts recovered during the Phase I
survey suggested that 41PK248 dated to the Early and Late stages of the Mossy Grove tradition (ca.
500 B.C. to A.D. 700) and may contain information on cultural continuity and/or change during the
transition from Early to Late Mossy Grove. Moreover, the recovery of Caddoan ceramics at the site may
shed light on inter- and intraregional trade networks and the overall relationship of the two culture areas
through time and/or the relationship between Caddoan groups and the Mossy Grove tradition.
If the cultural materials at site 41PK248 are intact or at least in reasonably good context, the site has the
potential to also provide chronometric data on the interior coastal Mossy Grove tradition. While Aten’s
1983 synthesis has provided a fairly well refined cultural sequence for coastal groups during the Late
Prehistoric, the interior coastal areas are plagued by a lack of sufficient chronological data (Story 1990).
One of the barriers to obtaining such data in this region is that nearly all known sites occur in sandy
mantles where stratigraphy is absent, organic preservation is minimal, and intact features are rare. The
recovery of diagnostic artifacts and documentation of their relative stratigraphic relationships in
conjunction with absolute dates retrieved from the site, would contribute to the refinement of the regional
prehistoric cultural chronology for the interior coastal plain of southeast Texas.
Given the anticipated absence of intact cultural features with datable organics, OSL offered an accurate
method for dating the site’s sandy matrix to help evaluate vertical integrity of the archeological deposits.
This technique has been used with some success in East Texas (Frederick et al. 2002) as well as in similar
sandy areas of interior peninsular Florida, where correlation among carbon dates, OSL dates, and
diagnostic artifacts demonstrated that the sands surrounding the artifacts were significantly older than the
artifacts themselves and that the apparent stratigraphy of the cultural materials was the result of postdepositional mixing, effectively creating a biomantle (cf. Wilder and Frederick 2006, Bateman et al.
2006b). This report includes a more detailed description of the OSL method and its application to
archeological contexts as a means to evaluate the degree of site bioturbation.
The data collection procedures outlined below were designed to provide the information necessary to
evaluate a site in this context.

FIELD METHODS
The initial task at the site was the excavation of five backhoe trenches designed to identify overall site
stratigraphy, as well as depositional and pedogenic parameters. These trenches were located as follows:
backhoe trench (BHT) 1 was placed on the northeastern part of the site, west of Bear Creek. BHT 2 was
placed in the southeastern portion of the site, slightly off the crest of the landform. BHT 3 was placed on a
levee-like deposit near the eastern margin of the site. BHTs 4 and 5 were placed just off the site area to
the south in order to contrast the stratigraphy of the floodplain bottoms with that on the rise. Figure 4
depicts the locations of all Trenches and test units excavated during the course of this project.
Five 1 x 1 m test units (TUs) were excavated on the site. Test Units were generally placed near or on the
most productive STPs from the initial site survey. Archeologist established TU 1 off of BHT 1 over a
faint soil stain observed in the trench’s south wall profile. Test Units 2 and 3 were excavated adjacent to
each other and formed a 1 x 2 m area placed over STP 36; TU 4 was placed near STP 27, while TU 5 was
placed along the western portion of the site, near STP 5. Due to the lack of any observable stratigraphy,
all test units were excavated in arbitrary 10-cm levels and continued in depth to the water table, which
was a maximum of about 140 cm below the modern surface. All sediments excavated from these units
were screened through 6.35 mm (.25 in) hardware cloth, and recovered artifacts were bagged and labeled
by test unit number, arbitrary 10-centimeter level, date, and name(s) of the excavators. The AlabamaCoushatta Tribe requested that all artifacts recovered from the excavations be returned to them therefore
none of the materials collected during this project were curated.
To maintain vertical control, excavations utilized unit-specific datum stakes with a line level established
10 centimeters above ground surface. Additionally, column samples were excavated from a sidewall
following the completion of each unit. These samples measured approximately 20 x 20 cm and were also
excavated in 10-cm levels to the base of each unit. Sediments from these samples were screened through
one-sixteenth inch screen to recover a sample of microdebitage and ceramic fragments.
Standard forms were used to record information on each test unit, including artifact recovery by level and
a description of the sediments and disturbances encountered during excavation. Following completion of
each test unit, a representative wall was chosen for stratigraphic profile, including Munsell color
assignments for each soil stratum, and the wall was photographed using a 7.0 mega-pixel digital camera.
All excavation units, trenches, datum stakes, site topography and prominent physical features were
subsequently mapped with a TOPCON Total Data Station.
In addition to these procedures, a series of four soil samples were taken for dating via OSL from TU 3. In
order to obtain these samples, a six-inch long section of three inch diameter PVC tube was hammered into
the profile wall upon completion of the test unit. These samples were taken at roughly 30-cm vertical
intervals down the unit profile. The packed sand was sealed into the tube with duct tape (to avoid light
exposure) and labeled according to its vertical provenience. These samples were sent to the Luminescence
Dating Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois, Chicago for processing and analysis by Dr.
Steven L. Forman.

LABORATORY AND ANALYSIS METHODS
All recovered materials were transported to the Blanton & Associates laboratory for processing and
analysis. Except for special samples for OSL and radiocarbon, all recovered cultural materials were
processed and catalogued at Blanton & Associates’ laboratory. Cataloging enlisted a lot numbering
system, with all specimens identified and tools given a unique lot number to aid in analysis. Sediment
samples were processed by water-screening through a one-sixteenth inch mesh screen to recover
microdebitage and macrobotanical remains. Materials recovered through this process were given unique
lot numbers to differentiate them from materials recovered through one-quarter inch mesh screen in the
field.
The OSL dating of site sediments relies on the premise that individual grains of quartz or feldspar store
trapped electrical charges in proportion to the amount of background ionizing radiation that they have
been subject to since burial. Every time grains are exposed to sunlight or high temperatures this charge is
released, thus the “time clock” is fully reset (or “bleached”). Typically, analysis is performed on bulk
sand grains termed a standard aliquot (between 3,000-5,000 grains), but recent advances have facilitated
the dating of samples of individual sand grains or single aliquots. Normally, it is assumed that the
sediment was fully reset by exposure to sunlight prior to burial and that no post-depositional sediment
disturbance has occurred. In terms of relating OSL data to the vertical integrity of an archeological
deposit, artifacts discarded on a surface that was subsequently buried through normal depositional
sedimentation, OSL dates obtained from the matrix surrounding the artifacts should closely parallel the
expected age of the cultural deposit and, therefore, reflecting the time of burial or last exposure of the
matrix to sunlight. If, however, artifacts were buried as a result of some type of pedoturbation (i.e.,
downward translocation via root casts), then the OSL derived dates should vary significantly from the
expected ages of the artifacts. Recent research by Frederick and Bateman (cf. Bateman et al. 2003,
Bateman et al. 2006b), Frederick et al. 2002, Frederick et al. 2005) has specifically addressed the issue of
pedoturbation and its effect on OSL derived ages.
Chipped stone artifacts were divided into the following analytical categories:
Lithic debitage: One of the primary goals of the lithic analysis was to determine if there were patterns in
the assemblage that would provide information on lithic technology and procurement as well as
technological change through time (i.e., Is the overall assemblage dominated by locally available
resources, or were “exotic” raw materials an important part of the lithic material culture? Are any changes
notable in manufacturing techniques through time?, etc.).
The debitage assemblage was sorted into categories reflecting various stages of lithic reduction and tool
manufacture based on the methodology presented in Cloud (2004). All debitage was sorted into the
categories of primary, secondary, tertiary, flake fragments, and shatter. However, the methodology used
here varies from Cloud (2004) in that the debitage categories of “chip” and “chunk” were collapsed into a
single shatter classification given the limitations in local raw material size. The small size of local gravels
appears to have resulted in the use of bipolar percussion (or flaking), where a core (i.e., a gravel) is placed
on a hard surface, such as another rock, that functions as an anvil and a downward blow directly on top of
the core drives the raw material onto the anvil, which tends to shatter the core rather than detaching

18

individual flakes (Whittaker 1994:114–115). This technique was typically utilized when the common raw
material tends to be rounded, like those found throughout the region (Whittaker 1994:115 and Banks
1990).
Evidence of thermal alteration was noted, as well as raw material type (quartzite, silicified wood, chert,
and other) for each specimen. The “other” category in raw material type includes small amounts of
silicified palm wood as well as a material that is possibly Manning Fused Glass. Manning Fused Glass is
formed from volcanic ash that fused within lignite. The closest known source is north of Huntsville in
Walker County, Texas.
The majority of lithic artifacts recovered at 41PK248 consisted of coarse grained quartzite and silicified
wood debitage. These raw materials often do not fracture as predictably as the finer grained chert,
resulting in debris that is sometimes not readily classifiable in terms of “flake type.” Therefore, it was
necessary to make an educated guess with some items, especially when bulbs of percussion were not
readily discernible.
Projectile Points/Knives: All projectile points were classified according to previously defined types when
possible using type descriptions published by Turner and Hester (1999) and Suhm and Jelks (1962).
Overall tool morphology, in particular the stem and basal form, were the primary defining criteria. Some
specimens that were incomplete or fragmentary were not able to be confidently assigned to a particular
type. In such instances, where possible, such tools were related to known types that they most closely
resembled (e.g.: a Gary-like projectile point), but were classified as untyped. Tool dimensions were
recorded with a Mitutoyo-Digimatic Caliper with a 0.01 mm resolution. All weights were recorded using
a Triton T2 scale with a resolution of 0.1 gram.
Ground and Pecked Stone Artifacts: Attributes recorded for groundstone artifacts included overall
dimension (maximum length, width, and thickness), weight, material type, and usewear patterns. Multiple
types of use wear (i.e., battering and smoothing/grinding) indicate multiple functions for the tool.
Battering is likely indicative of the use of the implement for lithic tool production or raw material
reduction, while grinding is presumably related to the processing of vegetal or other softer materials.
Ceramics: All ceramic artifacts recovered during testing were analyzed by Dr. Timothy K. Perttula, who
detailed his methods and results in a later section of this report.

FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
Test excavations at site 41PK248 occurred between March 27 and April 4, 2007 to determine if
significant archeological deposits would be destroyed by the construction of ACIR Well #9. The primary
focus of the testing phase was the determination of site significance and integrity as the sandy soils of east
Texas are notorious for bioturbative mixing of archeological deposits that limit a site’s potential to yield
new and valuable cultural data. In addition to integrity, two additional research concerns were chronology
and general technology and material culture.
Five backhoe trenches (BHTs) and five 1 x 1 m test units (TUs) were excavated during the testing phase.
To avoid unnecessary damage to the site, three backhoe trenches were placed immediately adjacent to the
site boundaries, while two additional trenches were excavated in the core of the site near or on the crest of
the knoll the site occupies. Test units focused on the most productive areas of the site as identified by the
recovery of artifacts during the Phase I survey of the site.
No cultural features containing datable remains were discovered during testing, though the recovery of
temporally diagnostic artifacts and absolute chronometric dates provided critical chronological data. The
diagnostic artifacts recovered from 41PK248 indicate a general Early Ceramic Mossy Grove period (ca.
500 B.C. – A.D. 700) occupation of the site (see Material Culture section). Additionally, two Goose
Creek Plain, var. unspecified sherds with organic residue on their exteriors were sent to Beta Analytic,
Inc. (Beta) for radiocarbon dating. Unfortunately, the residue on the exterior of both sherds contained
insufficient carbon to date. As a compromise, two radiocarbon assays were obtained from the sherds
themselves (portions of the sherds were crushed and processed by Beta), thereby providing a “no older
than date”. Field Sample 25-1 (Beta-230135) provided a 2 sigma calibrated date of A.D. 670 to 890
(B.P. 1280 to 1060), while Field Sample 29-1 (Beta-230136) produced a 2 sigma calibrated date of A.D.
210 to 390 (B.P. 1740 to 1560). Appendix A provides Beta’s results of the radiocarbon dating.
STRATIGRAPHY
A brief geoarcheological evaluation of site 41PK248 included the excavation of BHTs 1–5 as well as the
analysis of stratigraphy within the five 1 x 1 meter hand excavated test units. (see Figure 4). A synthesis
of the stratigraphic zones encountered during excavations follows.
Trench and test unit excavations discovered no cultural features or artifact clusters, though a faint soil
stain in BHT 1 was determined during the subsequent excavation of TU 1 to be a recent rodent burrow.
Trench excavations displayed the same basic stratigraphy across the site: a weak upper humic zone
(Zone I) of dark brown (10YR 3/3) loamy sand and forest detritus extending from the surface to a
maximum of 20 cm below surface overlying a thick, homogeneous zone composed of medium to fine
grain yellowish brown (10YR4/4) sand extending to roughly one meter below ground surface that in turn
was underlain by sands that became gradually paler (grading to 10YR6/3 at depth), were increasingly
clayey with depth, and contained grayish brown mineral (i.e., manganese) mottling. Below one meter, the
matrix gradually changed from homogenous moist sand to wet sandy clay loam, at which point
investigations on the crest of the knoll encountered a saturated zone from 130 to 140 cm below surface,

ARCHEOLOGICAL TESTING AT SITE 41PK248 ON THE ALABAMA-COUSHATTA INDIAN RESERVATION

20

just above the water table. Excavations off the crest of the knoll reached saturated soils as shallow as 80
cm below surface.
No evidence of depositional stratigraphy was noted in any of the trenches or test units except for a thin
localized buried A horizon noted below a recent levee deposit in BHT 3 (Figure 5). Above this buried
soil, the soils contained modern debris consisting of one Canis spp. tibia and glass beer bottle fragments
associated with a possible looters trench or dog burial. The paleosol appears to be a spatially restricted
phenomenon as it was not observed in any other trench or test unit. The horizon likely represents a
relatively recent overbank deposit unrelated to the cultural deposit.
During excavation of TU 2, differential fill consisting of disturbed soil, pine straw, and leaves from the
previous excavation of STP 36, was clearly visible. The Phase I survey encountered 20 lithic flakes of
petrified wood and quartzite, as well as a ceramic sherd from the lower levels of this shovel test, possibly
indicating a cultural feature or activity zone. However, when the paler sands at the lower levels of TUs 2–
3 were reached, a large pine tap-root cast was clearly visible. In essence, the excavation of STP 36 hit the
root cast, which was responsible for the downward transfer and accumulation of artifacts as the root cast
was gradually filled with younger sediments from above, including artifacts that may have fallen into a
root hole and were translocated down into older strata (Waters 1992:309). Waters (1992:309) also notes
that root casts “may not be recognizable if the matrix above and below the cavity is the same texture and
color”.
The degree of bioturbation of the site is critical with regards to determining site integrity. Although
disturbances in the upper one meter of deposit were present, the homogeneous texture and color of the
soils encountered at 41PK248 severely inhibited the ability to isolate root casts and other krotovina
(Figure 6). In the saturated zone just at or below the water table however, the contrast between krotovinas
and the surrounding sandy matrix increased, easily facilitating the recognition of disturbances versus the
upper levels. Generally, these disturbances were noted as paler, linear inclusions within the surrounding
matrix. The undeniable presence of deep root casts and rodent burrows in the deposit’s lower levels
strongly suggest that these disturbances are ubiquitous throughout the site’s sandy mantle.
A number of stream rolled bedload gravels (primarily quartzite and petrified wood) were recovered
throughout the deposit and, in fact, increased with depth and became more abundant as excavations
approached the water table. The presence of these gravels with what appeared to be iron oxide mottling
and staining in lower levels, suggests a seasonally fluctuating water table and the presence of channel lag
(i.e., bedload gravels) at depth associated with the lateral accretion of deposits during the meandering of
Bear Creek through time. Thus, the depositional regime at 41PK248 does not appear to reflect the vertical
accretion of sediments associated with natural levees or point bar deposits (Waters 1992:132–133).
MATERIAL CULTURE
Test excavations recovered a total of 1,753 prehistoric artifacts (Appendix B). The assemblage consists of
1,660 specimens of lithic debitage, 47 prehistoric ceramic sherds, 20 chipped stone tools, five
groundstone artifacts, two small pieces of red ochre, and 17 specimens of fire-cracked rock (252.1 g).

Faunal recovery was limited to a recent dog tibia recovered from BHT 3 (see Figure 5). Excavations
encountered no discrete artifact concentrations indicative of a potential living surface and/or activity
areas.
Cultural materials were encountered at all levels from the surface to the water table, which was
encountered at 80 cm below surface off the crest of the knoll and between 130 and 140 cm below surface
on the top of the landform (see Appendix B). Modern debris consisting of pull tabs and clear and brown
glass fragments was noted in TUs 1–3 from 0 to 20 cm below surface. No modern items were
encountered below 20 cm (Level 2). Artifact recovery dropped dramatically just off the crest of the knoll,
with TUs 4 and 5 producing no ceramics and significantly fewer artifacts than TUs 1, 2, and 3. In terms of
its horizontal dimensions, excavation data indicates that the site appears fairly discrete, conforming to the
overall dimensions of the landform.
Charcoal flecking was common throughout the sandy matrix in every test unit but excavations did not
discover any discrete concentrations suitable for chronometric dating. The source of the charcoal was
likely the result of past forest fires rather than being related to prehistoric occupation. Excavations also
recovered several small, charred nut-shell fragments from fine screen samples. It is possible that all or a
large portion of these relate to the prehistoric occupation of the site. However, since no fragments were
recovered in secure contexts, no definitive statement can be made concerning their relationship to the
prehistoric cultural materials.
Although no cultural features were encountered during testing, the presence of scattered burned rock (see
below) strongly suggests that thermal cultural features had been present. Prehistoric occupants of
41PK248 most likely constructed cultural features such as fire hearths and/or storage pits on site but, it is
the opinion of Blanton & Associates that soil acidity and extensive pedoturbation destroyed the presumed
cultural features.
Evidence of pedoturbation was noted in an abundance of small insect krotovina and deep root casts,
which became most visible only in the lower, paler sands encountered at approximately 1 meter below
surface (Figure 7). A representative example of this was observed during the excavation of TU 2. This
unit encompassed STP 36, which was excavated during the initial survey of the site. The excavation of
TUs 2 and 3 provided a cross section of STP 36, in which differential fill consisting of disturbed soil, pine
straw, and leaves from the previous shovel test excavation were clearly visible. The survey recovered 20
lithic flakes of petrified wood and quartzite, as well as one ceramic sherd from the lower portion of this
shovel test, possibly intimating a cultural feature or activity zone. However, when the paler sands at the
lower levels of TUs 2 and 3 were reached, a root cast was clearly visible. The excavation of STP 36 had
hit this root cast, which appears to be responsible for the downward transfer and accumulation of artifacts.
Waters (1992) describes the mechanics of this process and notes that root casts “may not be recognizable
if the matrix above and below the cavity is the same texture and color,” (Waters 1992: 309). At 41PK248,
the homogeneous texture and color of the soils severely inhibited the ability to isolate root casts in the
upper levels of the excavation units. However, their identification was easier when there a greater contrast
between soil matrices began at about one meter below surface and extended to the water table.

Lithic Artifacts
Projectile Points Ten artifacts were classified as projectile points/knives (Figure 8 and Appendix B). Of
these, four conform to the Gary type category, two are classified as Kent, one is a Yarborough, one an
Ellis, one is a Catahoula-like arrow point fragment [probably a type A-2 in the typology used by Aten
(1983)], and one could not be confidently assigned to established point types although it might be a Gary
preform.
The Gary points were recovered from TU 1, Levels 6–7 and from TU 2, levels 11 and 13. The first of
these (Figure 8a) is fashioned from what is possibly Manning Fused Glass. It is well made, particularly
for a Gary point. The specimen has straight lateral edges, weak shoulders, and a contracting stem that has
been thinned. It appears to have been alternately beveled, resulting in a slight cork-screw twist of the
body. The second Gary point (Figure 8b) was recovered in the level immediately beneath the first. It is
made of a quartzite and is relatively thick in cross-section. This tool appears to have functioned as a knife,
as there is dulling and polishing along most of its lateral edges. The third Gary (Figure 8c) was recovered
from TU 2, level 11, at 108 cmbs. It is a finely made piece fashioned from quartzite. It has recurved
lateral edges, a contracting stem, and thinned base. The fourth point typed as a Gary was recovered near
the base (level 13) of TU 2 (Figure 8d). This specimen is unfinished and appears burned. The distal tip
has been broken off, and it is also missing one shoulder.

The Yarborough point was also recovered from TU 2, at the base of the unit, essentially in the water table
(Level 14) (Figure 8e). It is fashioned of silicified wood, has straight, lateral edges, and a pronounced
expanding base.
The Catahoula-like arrow point fragment was recovered from TU 4, level 4 (Figure 8f). It is fashioned of
a reddish chert, with a strong, squared barb and expanding, convex base.
Both Kent points were recovered from TU 4, levels 8 and 11. The specimen from level 8 is knife-like in
overall morphology with a deep corner notch on one side, while the opposite blade edge is fairly straight
for the entire length of the tool (Figure 8g). The specimen has a prominent medial ridge and retains
remnant cortex on the base. It is fashioned of a reddish, fine grained silicified wood. The Kent point
recovered from level 11 is yellow/brown fine chert and also has a strong medial ridge (Figure 8h). The
base is thinned, straight to slightly expanding, and like the other Kent specimen, exhibits remnant cortex
at its base.
One Ellis type dart point was recovered from TU 4, level 7 (60-70 cmbs) (Figure 8i). It is heavily firedamaged, with deep potlids on both faces. The distal tip is broken and there is remnant cortex on its base,
possibly indicating that this specimen was unfinished. A thick reddish chert preform (Figure 8j), possibly
a Gary, was also found in this level.
Bifaces and Biface Fragments: Testing recovered 14 bifaces and biface fragments (Lots 13-3, 22-1, 23-2,
24-1A and B, 26-2, 35-1, 37-1, 39-1, 42-3A and B, 43-2A and B, and 82). Seven bifaces were recovered
from TUs 1 (Lot 22-1), 2 (Lots 42-3A and B, 43-2C), 3 (Lot 24-1A and B), and BHT 2 (Lot 82). Five are
made of quartzite and two of silicified wood. One biface (Lot 82) is interpreted as a knife based on the
relative thickness (9.96 mm) and flaking craftsmanship as well as microflaking and edge dulling on both
the lateral edges. A probable Gary preform is also present (Lot 24-1A) which exhibits general similarities
to the Step 2 reduction stage as illustrated in Turner and Hester (1999:124). The remaining five artifacts
are thick (16.52 mm on average), retain cortex patches, and have sinuous lateral edges typical of
unfinished tools. It is possible that these items were intended to be preforms yet inherent internal flaws
typical of quartzite and silicified wood prevented completion of these tools.
A total of seven biface fragments were recovered from TUs 1, 2, and 3. Of these, six are of quartzite and
one of palmwood. All lack any distinguishing characteristics and were broken during manufacture or
subsequent use.
Cores: A total of three cores (Lots 55-2, 57-1A, and 57-1B) and one core fragment (Lot 12) were
recovered from TUs 1 and 4 between Levels 6 and 10. All are of a reddish-gray hue, medium grained
quartzite and retain patches of cortex on their dorsal and ventral sides. Two are bi-directional and two are
multi-directional, likely a direct result of the internal convolutions of the individual gravels. These are
probably locally procured stream worn gravels. None reveal evidence of additional alternate use-wear or
thermal alteration.
Ground and Pecked Stone: A total of three groundstone tools were recovered. Two are manos and one is
a mano fragment (Lot 12-3, 21-1, and 42-2). A unique fist-sized (8 x 8 x 4 cm) four-faceted palmwood

ARCHEOLOGICAL TESTING AT SITE 41PK248 ON THE ALABAMA-COUSHATTA INDIAN RESERVATION

27

mano was recovered in Level 3 of TU 3.The palmwood mano is likely a manuport as its size is unique for
the assemblage.
The remaining manos are made of coarse grained quartzite and exhibit only a single facet. Two have
extensive battering along their lateral margins indicative of heavy use, presumably during food
preparation or from secondary uses. In this lithic poor area, the stones were likely used for multiple
purposes, such as hammerstones or anvil stones for bipolar percussion. Two of the mano fragments were
fire-cracked, perhaps reflecting their final use for cooking after they had become non-functional as tools
through breakage or excessive wear. Based on the raw material types it is likely that the quartzite cobbles
were locally procured.
A single quartzite hammerstone fragment recovered from Shovel Test #36 at a depth of 130-140 cmbs
(Lot 36-2). Slight battering is evident on the exterior side with pronounced angular faceting on the interior
side. It is likely that this fragment represents a broken hammerstone re-utilized as a hearth stone.
Lithic Debitage
A total of 1,660 debitage specimens were recovered during test excavations. This category is divided
between unmodified (n=1,551) and modified (n=9) specimens.
Unmodified
Figure 9 depicts debitage frequency by level for all test units. The vertical distribution of debitage
suggests a peak between levels 6 and 7 (50-70 cmbs), which is most clearly reflected in the data from TU
1. Test Units 2 and 3 exhibit a similar spike in artifact frequencies. The debitage frequencies from TUs 4
and 5 weakly parallel those of TUs 4 and 5. Another hint at a possible cultural zone occurs higher in the
profile, between levels 2-4 (10-40 cmbs). At about one meter below surface, TUs 1, 2, and 4 all display
another peak in debitage counts, but interestingly TU 3, which was immediately adjacent to TU 2, does
not closely parallel the distribution from the other units. Thus, while the vertical distribution of debitage
hints at three possible cultural zones, the recovered assemblage offers no clear evidence of continuity or
change through time that would to support the separation of cultural materials into discrete, isolable
components.
The overall assemblage points to a largely local resource procurement regime: over 60% of the lithics
were of quartzite, and an additional 18% were of petrified wood, both locally available raw materials
outcropping in the Willis Formations (Banks 1990). The remainder of the assemblage consists of chert
(19%) and a catch-all “other” category (2%), which includes some specimens of probable Manning Fused
Glass. Evidence of thermal alteration was limited to only a few specimens and was not correlated with
any specific raw material type.
Examination of the unmodified lithic assemblage by reduction stage was hampered by the nature of the
raw materials. As stated previously, coarse grained quartzite and petrified wood often do no flake as
regularly or predictably as finer grained materials. This is reflected in the fact that nearly a third (30%) of

the overall assemblage is categorized as shatter. Although primary flakes account for only 9% of the
assemblage, it is likely that a large proportion of the “shatter” category is essentially remnants of the early
stages of lithic reduction. Secondary and tertiary flakes represent 23% and 28% of the assemblage,
respectively. Given this distribution, it appears that the debitage assemblage represents the full range of
lithic reduction as well as tool manufacture and maintenance performed on materials obtained primarily
from locally available lithic resources.
Modified
Modified: A total of nine pieces of edge modified debitage were recovered during excavation of TU 1, 3
and 4. Seven secondary flakes (Lots 12-5, 14-2, 16-3B, 18-2, 24-3, 27-2 and 52-1) two flake fragments
(Lots 16-3A and 17-2) were identified. The tools exhibit (contiguous and non-contiguous) non-systematic
microflaking along one or both lateral edges that are presumably a result of use wear during unspecified
cutting activities. None appear intentionally retouched and it is presumed these tools represent expedient

cutting tools. Raw material types include quartzite (Lots 12-5, 16-3A and B, 18-2, 24-3, 27-2) and chert
(Lots 14-2, 17-2, and 52-1).
Fire-Cracked Rock: A total of 17 burned and fire-cracked rocks (252.1 g) were recovered during testing
(Table 1). The assemblage was split between quartzite specimens (57%) and ferrunginous sandstone
(43%).

Ceramic Artifacts
Excavations retrieved 47 ceramic sherds from TUs 1, 2, and 3. Figure 10 displays ceramic frequency by
level for TUs 1, 2, and 3. Test Units 4 and 5 yielded no ceramics. With the exception of two tempered
sherds, 44 specimens are sandy paste untempered Goose Creek Plain var. undetermined (one extremely
small and eroded specimen was not included in the analysis because of poor preservation). Dr. Timothy
Pertulla conducted a thorough analysis of the ceramics and his report is available as Appendix B.
Other Artifacts
Two small (≤ 0.5 cm in diameter) fragments of red ochre (Lot 8-1 and Lot 16-2) were recovered from
TU1, Levels 2 (Lot 8-1) and 10. The specimens exhibit no evidence of grinding or other use wear and
excavations discovered no artifacts with discernible pigments.
Faunal Material
Test excavations recovered one bone from the east wall of BHT 3 roughly 60 cm below surface. Analysis
of the bone by graduate paleontology student Farrah Welch from The University of Texas at Austin
indicated that the specimen is a left tibia from a non-human, mid-sized, adult mammal. The complete
fusion of the proximal and distal epiphyses designates the animal as an adult. While the bone is
mammalian, the size (about 20cm in length) and morphology of the bone rule out human origin, and are
most likely indicative of coyote (Canis latrans) or other canine.

The bone appears relatively recent and was recovered adjacent to what appeared to be a 70-cm deep and
30 to 40-cm wide looters trench. However, given the presence of the bone, it is possible that the trench
was dug for the burial of a dog. No other bones were discovered in the area or during test unit excavations
CONCLUSIONS
Test excavations at 4PK248 attempted to answer questions concerning the type of occupation(s) the site’s
deposit reflects, its integrity, and its research potential/significance. To help evaluate the site’s
significance it was critical to determine the temporal and cultural affiliations of the deposit to assess
cultural change or continuity in technology and site occupation through time. The following reiterates the
research questions presented previously and then discusses the answers to those questions as derived from
the cultural materials recovered during testing, as well as the results of the OSL and radiocarbon analyses.
SITE INTEGRITY
Does the cultural deposit at 41PK248 represent a single or multicomponent occupation, are the cultural
materials preserved within discrete stratigraphic zones that allow researchers to assess the potential for
artifact mixing, and finally, regardless of the condition of the remains within the sandy sediments, are

ARCHEOLOGICAL TESTING AT SITE 41PK248 ON THE ALABAMA-COUSHATTA INDIAN RESERVATION

31

there intact cultural features cut into the site’s underlying basal clay that can provide important
information concerning prehistoric adaptations?
Test excavations determined that the site was primarily occupied during the pre-Caddo ceramic Early and
Late periods of the Mossy Grove Tradition, although there was minor evidence suggestive of an earlier
Archaic occupation in the form of a Yarborough dart point, as well as a possible early Caddo component
based on the recovery of two small sherds tempered with bone and grog. However, the two tempered
sherds were not identified as Caddo by Dr. Tim Pertulla (see Appendix C). Thus, the cultural deposit
appears to represent multicomponents.
The multicomponent deposit is buried within a massive sandy mantle with no depositional stratigraphy.
The site exhibited three broad stratigraphic zones between 0 and 140 centimeters below surface, with no
evidence of discrete occupations or activity areas. Based on the lack of discrete cultural zones with intact
features (with or without datable remains), activity areas, and clearly associated diagnostic artifacts, the
deposit is a mixture of occupational debris dating to the Early and Late Mossy Grove periods.
Test excavations were unable to determine if features were incised into the basal clay because of the
area’s high water table. Saturated soils and water were encountered as shallow as 80 cm below surface,
though the typical depth was between 130 and 140 cm below surface. Smooth waterworn gravels and
cobbles recovered throughout the deposit, particularly from Level 8 in TU 5 and Levels 13 and 14 in TUs
1, 2, 3, and 4 that are suggestive of channel lag deposits probably associated with the lateral accretion of
deposits during the meadering of Bear Creek through time. As described previously, all excavation units
eventually filled with water following excavations.
Additional data relevant to this issue are the results of the OSL analysis, which is addressed below in
conjunction with cultural chronology.
CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
Does site 41PK248 represent a single-component Mossy Grove site with associated Caddoan materials, a
single component Early Ceramic site with some associated Mossy Grove materials, or a multi-component
occupation exhibiting use of the area by Mossy Grove and Early Ceramic/Caddoan groups?
Studies on archeological sites in east Texas and peninsular Florida have demonstrated that OSL can be
used to detect pedoturbation within sandy soil matrices. Their work is relevant to this study, it is
summarized below.
Bateman and Frederick examined four sites representing a continuum of post-depositional disturbance,
ranging from “pristine,” to “highly-disturbed.” Two of these sites were located in peninsular Florida and
two were located in east Texas. One site, (Ebersbach Midden, in Florida) was chosen as a “control” case
because it had clear evidence of depositional stratigraphy in the form of alternating deposits of sand and
muck. These strata formed as the result of past flood episodes associated with hurricanes or major tropical
storms. At this site, standard aliquot (SA) OSL dates were in good agreement with a series of four
radiocarbon dates and the known age of the cultural deposits. Additionally, single-grain OSL dates were

ARCHEOLOGICAL TESTING AT SITE 41PK248 ON THE ALABAMA-COUSHATTA INDIAN RESERVATION

32

consistent with the other forms of dating and exhibited a tight, normal distribution, which is indicative of
a sample that has remained essentially undisturbed since the sediments were originally deposited. This
site was thus considered to represent the “pristine” end of the disturbance continuum.
Another Florida site, the Burnt Hammock, represents the other end of the continuum. The different
distributions of diagnostic artifacts recovered from this site suggested four cultural components, ranging
from a historic-era occupation to an early ceramic prehistoric occupation (Wilder and Frederick
2006: 81). All these materials occurred within a structureless, texturally homogenous, unconsolidated
sandy matrix like that at 41PK248. While it was apparent from field observations that some mixing of the
deposit had occurred (historic artifacts were found in the same 10 cm level as prehistoric ceramics), the
recovery of a cluster of sherds belonging to one prehistoric ceramic vessel suggested that the site retained
some degree of depositional integrity.
A series of five radiocarbon dates (including dates from soot encrustation on the vessel rim) and three
OSL samples were taken at various depths from the soil column. Both radiocarbon and OSL dates showed
an increase in age with depth; however, there was an increasing discrepancy between the two dating
methods that was positively correlated with depth. The OSL dates were consistently and increasingly
older than the associated radiocarbon dates. This pattern was most marked in the Standard Aliquot dates,
while the single-grain OSL dates were in closer agreement with the radiocarbon data. Frederick et al.
attributed the standard aliquot age overestimate to “the disproportionate influence of old, bright sand
grains mixed in with younger, less luminescent grains.” (Frederick et al. 2005: 284).
The increase in age with depth was the result of less amounts of fully reset sand grains occurring at depth
and, therefore, reflecting not a true depositional age but rather a decreasing intensity of pedoturbation
(Bateman et al. 2003: 1171). The closer correspondence of single-grain dates with radiocarbon dates and
known ages of the archeological materials was interpreted as resulting from sands that had been brought
to the surface by insects. These old sands were redeposited on the surface, and their quartz clocks were
“reset.” But, in the near surface environment, they were exposed to more intensive pedoturbation and
became mixed with slightly older sand. This process was graphically illustrated in regards to its effect on
archeological deposits and is reproduced here (Figure 11).
Data from the two Texas sites included in the study indicated that they fell-mid-range in the continuum,
representing varying degrees of pedoturbation. One site, the Cottonwood Springs site, displayed no
stratigraphic structure, yet appeared largely intact based on the OSL data. The other site, (Rena Branch)
had apparent stratigraphy in the form of a buried soil but had been severely disturbed. Bateman et al.
(2006a: 13) concluded that “ancient sandy surfaces can be seemingly covered with surficial sediments
that on face value produce stratigraphically consistent ages. However, in reality these young OSL dates
have little relationship to burial age and more to do with the type and intensity of bioturbation which has
rejuvenated a more ancient strata.”

Figure 11. Sketch illustrating the formation processes inferred from the OSL dating results at the sandy
sites.Different shaped icons represent cultural material deposited on the ground surface at the
different points in time. Note how the exhumation of sand from various depths contributes to
site burial, and near-surface mixing results in dispersing the cultural material at depth, and in
some cases, mixing occupation debris of different ages together (adapted from Frederick et al.
2006)

For the current project, a series of four sediment samples taken at 30-cm intervals from TU 2 were
submitted for OSL dating. The results are presented in Table 2 and Figure 12. Unfortunately, schedule
and budget constraints prevented the processing of single-grain dates so all dates presented here refer to
Standard Aliquot samples of between 3,000-5,000 grains. As would be expected in a stratified deposit, the
derived dates show an increase in age with depth. The sample from 20-25 cm below surface yielded an
age of 785 + 55 yrs. B.P. The next sample was taken from 50-55 cmbs and yielded an age of 2030 + 160
yrs. B.P. The third OSL date was taken from 80-85 cmbs and yielded an age of 3195 + 250 yrs. B.P., and a
final sample taken from 110-115 cmbs was dated to 6120 + 460 yrs. B.P. (An additional duplicate
analysis was conducted on this last sample using a smaller aliquot size of 500-800 grains and yielded
statistically identical results to the larger standard aliquot count).
In addition to the OSL-derived dates, two ceramic sherds with soot encrustations on their exterior were
submitted for AMS radiocarbon dating. However, upon combustion, neither sample had sufficient carbon
to render a date. Analysts at Beta Analytic Inc. indicated that this situation sometimes occurs with carbon
that is the result of fire residue rather than food residue (Ron Hatfield, personal communication). In order
to derive a date, therefore, a portion of each of these sherds was crushed in order to date the residual
organics within the sherds themselves. These dates indicate a maximum age for the sherds. The first date,
taken from a sherd recovered in TU 3 at a depth of 60-70 cmbs, yielded an age of 1280-1060 cal. yrs. B.P.
The second date, on a sherd from the same unit but at a depth of 100-110 cmbs, yielded an age of 17401560 cal. yrs. B.P. (all radiocarbon dates are presented at the 2-sigma confidence level in radiocarbon
years B.P., for full data on radiocarbon results (see Appendix A).

Figure 12. Unweighted probability function from OSL analysis
The radiocarbon dates appear consistent with the expected age of the ceramic assemblage. The lowermost
sherd falls squarely within the Early Ceramic period, while the uppermost sherd appears to be slightly
more recent. Since a minor amount of grog-and-bone tempered pottery was recovered in these upper
levels, both these dates appear to be consistent with the known cultural/temporal framework for this
region. However, the OSL derived dates show an increasing discrepancy with the expected age that is
positively correlated with depth. The most dramatic example of this phenomenon is the lowermost OSL
date taken from 110-115 cmbs, which yielded an age of 6120 + 460 yrs. B.P., while the date from a sherd
just above it (100-110 cm) yielded an age of 1740-1560 cal. yrs. B.P. Additionally, the OSL derived date
of 2030 + 160 yrs. B.P. from sediments at 50-55 cmbs conflicts with the radiocarbon derived date of 12801060 cal. yrs. B.P. from a sherd recovered below the OSL sample location (60-70 cmbs).
The OSL data and its discrepancy with other independently arrived dates closely parallel data from
multiple upland sandy sites in central Florida (cf. Wilder and Frederick 2006). The matrix of these sites,
like 41PK248, displayed little to no evidence of depositional stratigraphy. Most of the Florida sites
exhibited apparent cultural stratification, but where there were sufficient numbers of diagnostic artifacts,
it was apparent that some overlap of different aged artifacts had occurred. At 41PK248, the pattern is
similar: there is some evidence of cultural stratification based on the relative positions of diagnostic
artifacts as well as the overall distribution of lithic debris, but there are no clearly discernible breaks
separating different aged components.

Based on established chronologies, the bulk of cultural material at 41PK248 should date to 2470 to 1250
yrs. B.P. and the radiocarbon dates from two ceramic sherds are consistent with this time frame.
However, the dated sherds are enveloped in sands that are significantly older than the artifacts
themselves. Overall, these results suggest that a process similar to that depicted in Figure 13 is occurring
at 41PK248. It is important to note that if two cultural components are widely separated in time, isolation
of discrete assemblages is possible even if the artifacts are no longer in primary context. If, however,
multiple occupations occurred but are not widely separated in time, then it is likely that artifacts from two
different occupations would be mixed together.
Numerous burrowing vertebrate and invertebrate species occur in this region of Texas, and undoubtedly
contributed to the near-surface mixing of the cultural deposit at 41PK248. Another causal element of
bioturbation at the site are deep pine tree root casts which, when decayed or burned, form voids allowing
younger-age sands (and artifacts) to mix with older, deeper sediments, as illustrated in Waters’
(1992: 310) discussion of post burial site disturbances. Direct evidence of artifact displacement of this
sort was found in TU 2 and the re-excavation of STP 36. Moreover, the ubiquitous charcoal flecking
noted between 0 and 70 cm below surface likely represents displacement via burned or decayed roots.
Upward exhumation of sands can occur through worm or insect activity, and insect krotovina were
observed in all test unit profiles, often quite deep. The fact that these traces were still visible in the highly
acidic soils suggests that they are not extremely old and that the mixing process at this site is ongoing. A
suite of bioturbative agents has impacted the prehistoric deposit through time, which has resulted in the
loss of horizontal and vertical integrity.
TECHNOLOGY AND MATERIAL CULTURE
During the later part of the Mossy Grove period, Caddoan or Caddoan-like ceramics appear in the
archeological record. During the original survey investigations, two unidentified ceramic sherds with a
red slip or film were uncovered. Additionally, STP 36 contained one probable bone tempered rim sherd.
If Caddoan, those artifacts, presented an intriguing possibility with regards to site occupations and Mossy
Grove/Caddo interaction.
Do the two red presumably decorated sherds and the probable bone-tempered sherd represent Caddoan
ceramics or are the red decorated specimens actually Goose Creek Red Slipped, and could the bonetempered sherd actually be an Early Ceramic example? Pertulla (2007: Appendix C of this report)
identified no definitive Caddo or Caddo-like ceramics during his analysis of the ceramics from 41PK248.
Ninety-five percent (N=37) of the ceramic assemblage consists of Goose Creek Plain var. unspecified,
while the remaining five-percent (N=2) is identified as bone, grog, or hematite tempered sandy paste
specimens. The plain ceramic sherds recovered in test excavations at 41PK248 indicate that the site was
occupied in the Early Ceramic period (ca. 2470-1250 years ago) by Mossy Grove culture groups that
lived in Southeast Texas and parts of East Texas (Pertulla 2007: Appendix C of this report).
In terms of lithic technology, the survey investigations recovered a Gary point from ST 5 (in the site
center) manufactured from petrified wood, as well as the recovery of six petrified wood tertiary flakes and
one secondary petrified wood flake from ST 36 in the northern end of the site. Could the concentration of

Figure 13. The disturbance caused by root growth while the plant is alive and the formation of the root
casts after it dies. As the roots grow, they push sediment particles aside (a). When the tree dies,
the wood eventually rots, creating cavities (b). The root cavities then become filled with
sediment derived from the surface, or they may collapse. Note that some artifacts (solid
triangles) from the surface have fallen into the trunk and root cavities and have become
incorporated into the krotovina fill (adapted from Waters 1992: Figure 7.10 after Limbrey
1975).

the petrified wood flakes in ST 36 (as well as the other debitage specimens) reflect a discrete activity
area?
As addressed previously, no discrete occupations were discerned at 41PK248 during testing. Given the
described level of bioturbation, lack of cultural stratigraphy and activity areas, as well as the OSL results,
it was not possible to discern horizontal patterns of lithic debitage, formal stone tools, and concentrations
of ceramics to elucidate activity patterns within a particular temporal period. Similarly, the lack of

identifiable cultural features precluded the comparison and contrast of discrete features and/or activity
areas to assess cultural continuity and change in terms of lithic and ceramic technologies at the site.
Moreover, the recovered assemblage offers no clear evidence of change through time that might facilitate
a separation of cultural materials into discrete, isolable components.
The debitage inventory recovered during survey efforts primarily suggested secondary and tertiary
reduction, as the majority of recovered specimens were classified as secondary and tertiary flakes.
Determination of reduction stage was hampered by the nature of the raw materials, as the assemblage’s
predominant coarse-grained quartzite and petrified wood resources are more difficult to work, frequently
not flaking as predictably as finer grained materials like quality chert or silicified palm wood. This
appears to be reflected in the fact that approximately one-third of the overall assemblage is categorized as
shatter. Although primary flakes account for only 9% of the assemblage, it is likely that a large proportion
of the “shatter” category is essentially remnants of the early stages of lithic reduction, particularly if
bipolar percussion was common. Combined, secondary and tertiary flakes represent 51% of the
assemblage.
It appears that the debitage assemblage recovered during testing represents the full range of lithic
reduction while emphasizing the secondary and tertiary phases. Thus, the debitage from testing parallels
that observed during survey investigations and indicates the acquisition of raw materials obtained
primarily from locally available gravel resources (i.e., small chert, quartzite, and petrified wood from the
Willis Formation). Minimal amounts of other lithic material types identified in the testing assemblage that
reflect “exotic” (not locally available) lithic sources include palm wood and possible Manning Fused
Glass.
It is presumed that secondary and tertiary reduction on 41PK248 was complemented with the final
thinning and maintenance/refurbishing of formal tools. This means that even smaller microdebitage could
aid in determining the extent to which tool finishing and/or maintenance was undertaken. However, the
relatively small sample (N=47) of microdebitage specimens recovered from flotation and fine screening
merely intimates that final tool manufacture and maintenance was occurring; the data does not offer
enough resolution to provide an assessment of the actual level of intensity of these activities at the site
through time.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Test excavations at site 41PK248 have provided informative though limited data concerning the
archeology of the Livingston area of southeast Texas, particularly for portions of the Early Ceramic
Mossy Grove Tradition of inland southeast Texas. The recovered data offers comparative regional data as
well as sorely needed chronometric dates for pre-Caddo ceramic-bearing sites. Below is a brief summary
and discussion of the excavation data under the research issues presented in the Research Design chapter.
No cultural features were identified during the testing. Within deep sandy matrix sites, cultural features
are often difficult to detect due to the acidity of the soils which, combined with extensive bioturbation by
roots and rodents, effectively obscures and sometimes completely erases any remnant of cultural features
such as pits or postholes.
The vertical distribution of diagnostic projectile points suggests some degree of stratigraphic integrity in
that the Yarborough dart point was recovered at a lower level than the Gary and Kent specimens, while
the arrow point fragment was recovered above all of these. However, all cultural material recovered at
this site is dispersed through some 1.40 meters of homogeneous sands with no clear stratigraphic breaks.
Thus, the isolation of discrete cultural components was impossible. Field observations, coupled with
results from the OSL analyses, indicate that artifacts at this site are being buried primarily by postdepositional pedoturbation. This situation effectively precludes the potential to discover intact cultural
features or activity zones.
Organic preservation at the site is minimal, with the only faunal specimen being a relatively recent Canis
spp. While some small charred nut fragments were recovered from the fine screen samples, these cannot
be conclusively tied to the prehistoric occupation of the site given the lack of secure contextual links (i.e.,
cultural features containing nut shells). Due to the geomorphic setting of the site, it is the opinion of
Blanton & Associates that further investigations at 41PK248 would not have a high potential to discover
intact cultural features.
Additional investigations, therefore, would likely result simply in the collection of a larger assemblage of
durable material remains dating primarily (but not exclusively) to the Early Ceramic Mossy Grove period.
Such a collection would not possess the contextual integrity necessary to generate new information
concerning local and regional prehistoric adaptive behavior or further refinement of established cultural
chronologies. For these reasons, additional work at the site is not likely to generate important information
toward the understanding of the prehistory of the area. Based on results of the present investigations,
Blanton & Associates recommends that site 41PK248 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and the
proposed construction of ACIR Well #9 should be allowed to proceed as planned without additional
cultural resource investigations.

Woodland or Mossy Grove Ceramics from 41PK248, Polk County, Texas
Timothy K. Perttula
Thirty-nine sherds and six sherdlets were recovered in recent test excavations at 41PK248 on the
Alabama-Coushatta Reservation in Polk County, Texas (Table 1). With the exception of one sherd from a
shovel test, the remainder of the sherds and sherdlets came from Units 1, 2, and 3 on the crest of the sandy
knoll. The sherds are particularly common in Unit 3 (21 sherds per square meter).

The sherds were almost exclusively recovered from 40-110 cm bs, other than one small sherd from 10-20
cm bs in Unit 1 (Table 2). Although the sample size of sherds is small, the vertical distribution of sherds
suggests two peaks in ceramic use: 50-70 cm bs and 80-100 cm bs. The upper zone is associated with
Gary and Ellis dart points, while the lower zone is associated with Kent and Gary dart points. Both zones
date to the Woodland or Mossy Grove period (see Story 1990:256-279), but the absolute age of the sherds
in the archeological deposits has not been established. It is possible, however, to offer some speculations
about the probable absolute age—and cultural affiliations—of the Woodland period component at
41PK248, and I will return to these topics after describing the character of the ceramic sherds from the
site.

Analysis of the 41PK248 Sherds
Analysis of the ceramics from 41PK248 is based on differences in paste and temper, the type of sherd
(i.e., rim, body, or base), rim and lip form, decoration (if present), surface treatment (smoothing or
burnishing; see Rice 1987), and oxidation patterns (cf. Teltser 1993; Perttula 2005). Sherd cross-sections
were inspected macroscopically and occasionally with a 10X hand lens to determine the character of the
paste and its inclusions. Determining the firing atmosphere—the conditions of temperature, duration of
firing, clays with different organic contents, or the amount of oxygen available at the time of firing—is
based on the identification of the firing core in the sherd cross-sections and the identification of oxidation
patterns as defined in Teltser (1993:535-536 and Figure 2) and Perttula (2005: Figure 5-30).
More specifically, the following attributes were employed in the analysis of the ceramics from 41PK248:
(1) temper: the deliberate and indeterminate materials found in the paste (Rice 1987:411), including a
variety of tempers (grog or crushed sherds, bone, hematite, and quartz sands, etc.) and “particulate matter
of some size”; (2) the character of the paste (i.e., predominantly clay or sandy) (3) although most of the
sherds have indeterminate vessel forms, where sherds were large enough, vessel form categories were
noted. Other form attributes include rim profile and lip profile; and (4) core colors: observations on
ceramic cross-section colors permit consideration of oxidation patterns (Teltser 1993:Figure 2), and thus
the conditions under which the vessel was fired and then cooled after firing. Also noted is the presence
and location of fire-clouding, sooting, or smudging from cooking use (Skibo 1992), and charred organic
remains. Finally, wall thickness was recorded in millimeters (mm), using a vernier caliper, along the midsection of the sherd.
With respect to interior and exterior surface treatment, the primary methods of finishing the surface of the
vessel included smoothing or burnishing (Rice 1987:138). Smoothing creates “a finer and more regular
surface...[and] has a matte rather than a lustrous finish” (Rice 1987:138). Burnishing, on the other hand,
creates an irregular lustrous finish marked by parallel facets left by the burnishing tool (perhaps a pebble
or bone).
Table 3 provides a sherd-by-sherd inventory of the general characteristics of the 41PK248 sherds. Two of
the sherds have a clay paste and are tempered with bone, grog, or hematite (or a combination of these
aplastics), while the remainder have a medium to coarse sandy paste. None of the sherds are decorated.

The two tempered body sherds are both from Unit 1, between 10-60 cm bs (see Table 3). They have a
clay paste and finely crushed pieces of bone, grog, or hematite added to the paste. These two sherds are
from thin vessels (mean thickness of 4.6 + 0.3 mm), probably bowls, that were fired in a reducing
environment, but then cooled in the open air (cf. Teltser 1993: Figure 2F). The general depth of these two
sherds may suggest that they are a product of a later occupation (at least the sherd from level 2), but there
is no good evidence to support such a conclusion since sandy paste and tempered sherds are found
together in level 6 of Unit 1 (see Table 3). Grog-tempered pottery is occasionally found in Mossy Grove
contexts in East Texas and Southeast Texas as well as post A.D. 800 Caddo contexts in the former region,
and grog-tempered pottery (i.e., Baytown Plain, var. San Jacinto) is also common along the Southeast
Texas coast, but after ca. A.D. 1000 (Aten 1983). In East Texas, the grog-tempered pottery sometimes has
a sandy paste or a clayey/silty paste (Story 1990: Table 64). The clay paste sherds are sometimes
decorated with incised and stamped decorations that appear to be from Marksville Incised and Marksville
Stamped vessels made in the lower Mississippi River valley.
The rest of the sherds (six rims and 31 body) have a sandy paste and can be identified as Goose Creek
Plain, var. unspecified (Aten 1983:233-234). These sandy paste sherds have fine to coarse pastes—a
“fairly wide range of sand grain size combinations” (Aten and Bollich 2002:49)—that are compact; only
one sherd has ferruginous sandstone pieces in the paste. The majority of the sandy paste sherds were
smoothed when the clay was wet and before firing, especially on the exterior vessel surface (59%) (see
Table 3). Approximately 37% were smoothed on the interior vessel surface. One sherd (2.7%) has been
burnished on both interior and exterior surfaces (see Table 3).
The Goose Creek Plain vessel sherds from 41PK248 are from vessels fired in a wide variety of ways,
suggesting that firing was not particularly well controlled by these early potters. About 19% of the sherds
are from vessels that were oxidized during firing (A under firing conditions in Table 3) and 11% are
incompletely oxidized (C-E on Table 3). Only 8% have dark cores throughout, indicating that they were
from reducing or low oxygen-fired vessels (B on Table 3). Another 16% are from vessels fired in a
reducing environment but then pulled from the fire to cool in the open air (F-H on Table 3). The largest
number of sherds (41%) have a distinctive core, with a dark exterior/light interior cross-section or lighter
cores than their surfaces (I-L on Table 3). Aten and Bollich (2002:54-55) note that this manner of vessel
firing is characteristic of Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified. They also suggest that vessels with this
kind of firing may have been placed in a fire with the “orifice [of the vessel] facing into the fire.”
Furthermore, the sherds with cores lighter than the surfaces may have come from vessels where “after
extended firing that burned off all organics, the fire may have been smothered to cause reduction and
darkening of the exterior surface.” The one sherd with an X firing condition (see Table 3) has two
oxidized and reduced bands in its core, suggesting reheating of the vessel or repeated smothering and
oxidation. This is not an isolated or unique occurrence; Greaves (2002:76) also noted sherds with
evidence of multiple firings in the ceramic assemblage from 41WA47 in the San Jacinto River basin in
Southeast Texas.
All six of the rims have rounded lips, with direct or vertical standing walls. The largest rim has a 15 cm
orifice diameter and is likely from a shallow and not particularly large bowl (Figure 1). Other sherds are
probably from cooking jars; two sherds from Unit 3 have preserved organic residues on exterior surfaces
(see Table 3) from the charring of food stuffs. A few sherds have fire clouding (Figure 1).
The Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified sherds from 41PK248 are from compact and smoothed vessels
made by coiling. The smoothing served to better weld the coils together before firing. The paste is not
contorted, thus suggesting it was decently prepared for vessel shaping, and the rim and body walls are
also quite uniform in thickness: another indication of some measure of ceramic craftsmanship. The sandy
paste vessels have thin walls: rims are 5.87 + 0.77 mm in thickness (range of 4.9-7.0 mm); body sherds
have a mean thickness of 5.55 + 0.82 mm (range 3.6-6.9 mm). The rims may have been made to be
thicker than the vessel body walls to stand up to the cooking, stirring, and ladling of cooked food stuffs
from these vessels and the rougher expected treatment of rims in general.

Figure 1. Two examples of Goose Creek Plain ceramic sherds.
Age and Cultural Affiliation of the 41PK248 Ceramics
The adoption and use of sandy paste Goose Creek Plain pottery was apparently a better way to cook foods
than the hot rock cooking/stone boiling in hide-lined pits or basketry of earlier times because stews/broths
could instead be cooked and simmered in ceramic vessels. Traditional and new food stuffs could be
prepared in ways that were more effective, probably through indirect cooking, and probably also “to
maximize the food value of what…[Mossy Grove culture peoples] were cooking, by leaving it in the stew
pot instead of vulnerable to partial loss over open flames” (Anderson 2005:205). The introduction of this
new cooking technology after ca. 2500 years ago in Southeast and East Texas was not apparently
associated with the use of any agricultural domesticates; only after ca. A.D. 800, in East Texas, were
domesticated plant foods prepared with a cooking technology where foods were prepared in ceramic
vessels that set directly over or in fire.
Sandy paste pottery is some of the earliest pottery made and used by Native Americans in East Texas and
Southeast Texas. The earliest pottery in these regions—Tchefuncte pottery—may date as early as 2500
years ago, if not earlier (see Webb et al. 1969). Saunders and Hays (2004:16) do report that Tchefuncte
pottery from Louisiana has been dated as early as 2800-3400 years B.P. Story (1990:275) had suggested
some years ago that the earliest sandy paste ceramics in the Conroe-Livingston area (the general region of
41PK248) dated from ca. 100 B.C. to A.D. 900; she termed this the Early Ceramic period of the Mossy
Grove culture in inland Southeast Texas. More recent dating of archeological components with Goose
Creek Plain sandy paste pottery indicates that this distinctive plain ware was made beginning about and
after 2500 years ago. Table 4 lists a range of these dated sites—some Mossy Grove, but not all (e.g.,
Rogers et al. 2001)—and includes sites from inland Southeast Texas and the Louisiana coast to the Sabine
River basin in East Texas.
These dated sites range as late as ca. A.D. 900, as previously indicated by Story (1990). It is possible to
refine the ending date for the Early Ceramic period to ca. A.D. 700 or 1250 years B.P. by excluding sites
that have early arrow points in addition to or instead of Gary and Kent dart points. The latter are
apparently diagnostic of the Early Ceramic period (Story 1990:275). Based on the Table 4 radiocarbon
date summary of sites with Goose Creek Plain sherds and the presumed timing in the adoption of arrow
points, then, the 41PK248 ceramic assemblage could date conservatively to anywhere from ca. 2470-1250
years ago.

There is no question that the archeological deposits at 41PK248 date to the Early Ceramic period of the
Mossy Grove culture, and are affiliated with inland Southeast and East Texas aboriginal groups that made
and used Goose Creek Plain sandy paste pottery and Gary and Kent dart points. At this time and based
strictly on regionally obtained radiocarbon dates (see Table 4), it is not possible to establish more
precisely the age of the 41PK248 occupation within the 1200 year span when the early sandy paste
pottery was made on the upper Texas coast and in inland Southeast Texas.
Radiocarbon and OSL dates from 41PK248 should provide a more precise absolute age of the Early
Ceramic period occupation at the site. What are also needed are detailed studies of the temporal and
spatial patterning in technological, functional, and stylistic attributes of the sandy paste pottery in this
area, as well as an examination of any recognizable pottery attributes that may have chronological or
cultural significance. For example, in sandy paste pottery assemblages from Lake Naconiche in
Nacogdoches County in East Texas (Perttula 2007)—otherwise dominated by plain vessels, as are all
Mossy Grove sites—there are a number of lip notch-decorated vessel rims. These distinctive rims come
from archeological deposits in two sites dated from 2230-1985 B.P. at the Boyette site (41NA285) and
2075-1830 B.P. at the Naconiche Creek site (41NA236). Lip notched sandy paste vessel rims may thus be
an excellent horizon marker for the period between 2230-1830 years ago, if these dates can be
independently verified in future Mossy Grove culture ceramic analyses.
Summary of the Ceramic Assemblage
The plain ceramic sherds recovered in test excavations at 41PK248 indicate that the site was occupied in
the Early Ceramic period (ca. 2470-1250 years ago) by Mossy Grove culture groups that lived in
Southeast Texas and parts of East Texas. The ceramics are dominated by Goose Creek Plain, var.
unspecified, a plain sandy paste ware that represents the earliest pottery made by aboriginal groups living
in those parts of Texas. The sandy paste pottery (and two bone-hematite and bone-grog-tempered plain
sherds) includes bowls and cooking jars that have a relatively coarse paste, thin rim and body walls, and
are regularly smoothed on both exterior and interior vessel surfaces before firing. Firing of the vessels
was accomplished under heterogeneous conditions, where a number of vessels may have been placed to
face into a fire, and regularly smothered or reheated to cause a reduction and darkening of the exterior
vessel surface.
