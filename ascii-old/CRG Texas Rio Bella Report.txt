RIO BELLA / LOMBARDY DITCH
RIO BELLA
Rio Bella refers to the site of “Rio Bella Resort on the Frio” located at 3088 Ranch Road
1120 listed near Rio Frio (Community), Texas 78879. The site has seven luxury cabins
with private balconies for direct view of the Frio River, which are for rent any time during
the year, with five more to be ready by May 2018. One large house is also available. The
acreage is located near the eastern center of the Christopher J. Wilkison survey #603,
A/993, property ID 5785. When purchased the 6.271 acres on January 14, 2014, the
Petrovics family lived in Evergreen, Jefferson County, Colorado (Real County: Vol.
73/681). An Oil and Gas Lease and Mineral deed had been previously executed by the
former land owner, William Haby, on December 28, 1929.
Following addition of the new cabins, renovation of the large house and opening an office
site, the current owners, Robert Petrovics and wife, Carole Petrovics, revised the area
from their name to the title of Frio River Rental, LLC, a Texas limited liability company
being 6.271 acreage on October 7, 2015 (Real County: Vol 90/195 #11027). Both Deeds
were still listed as Evergreen, Jefferson County, Colorado in the local Deed Record.
Robert and Carole Petrovics had purchased the site on January 14, 2015 from Kay
Anderson, Independent Executive of the Estate of Katherine Allen Harrison, dec’d and
spouse of Bailey Anderson. The sale included Harrison’s descendants: Jennifer
Michulka, individual and spouse of Jimmie MIchulka and Barbara Legler, individual and
spouse of Victor Legler. The sale listed the previous Deeds regarding a Right of Way
Deed dated September 24, 1949 (Vol. 21/161), a Telephone ROW dated March 3, 1982
(Vol.56/303), an Oil & Gas Lease dated February 18, 1919 by William Haby and A. C.
Austin (Vol.2/596), as well as a Mineral Deed dated December 28, 1929 for Oil & Gas
Lease (Vol. 3/ 4). The Irrigation Ditch easement was noted being set forth in Affidavit to
Water Appropriation dated March 31, 1916 located in the Deed of Trust Records of Real
County, Texas (Vol 1/151).
Located in a wooded area, the 6.271 acre site is within 4 miles of Garner State Park,
slightly north of Rio Frio Community and 6.5 miles south of Leakey, the central township
of Real County, Texas and County seat. The 6.271 acres is located nearly at the east
center of the Christopher J. Wilkison A/993 #603 survey.
By 2017, the 6.271 acres had a River House available on the northern section. Seven
rentable cabins are primarily located along the southern side of the 6.271 acres, all facing
the water of Rio Frio River. By summer of 2018, the north area will have five additional
rentable cabins. The large house is named Rio Grande River House and the southern
seven cabins are listed as Texas Rivers: Nueces, Trinity, Blanco, Pecos, Sabine, Medina
and Llano. The future five cabins will be named by central Texas Rivers as: Colorado,
Brazos, Guadalupe, Pedernales, and Comal.
The site is located in the near center but southern section of Real County. The area of
Real County is known as southwest Texas, bounded on the north and west by Edwards

County, on the east by Kerr and Bandera Counties and on the south by Uvalde County,
being 100 miles northwest of San Antonio in Bexar County. The 1836 Bexar County had
been in charge of western Texas until Bandera County (called Spanish for “flay”) became
formally organized on March 10, 1856.
Real County arrived out of the west side of
Bandera County in 1913 and adopted the Nueces River located on the western alignment
of present Real County. The present Rio Bella Resort is at the same location of the
beginning for the Lombardy Ditch of 1866.
After purchase of the property containing the Lombardy Dam and entrance of the
Irrigation Ditch, the Petrovics discovered that the Ditch was dry with no water entering the
site. The ditch was under-maintained for many years and according to the local residents,
has not flowed for over 20 years. The historic Cypress Trees located south of the Wilkison
Survey were not intact, having died due to the lack of Ditch water.
In 1875, the founders of Lombardy Company, requested the adjacent Irrigation users of
water from the Ditch to keep the Ditch, open and clean. The Petrovics understood this
need and discovered the current Lombardy Irrigation Company managers were
concerned about the poor condition of the Ditch.
Looking at current conditions of the Ditch in 2017, there are a number of areas where the
old Ditch has been totally removed as a water flow. Suggestion has been made from the
current Lombardy Irrigation Company members to urge the current 2017 landowners to
repair the Ditch by installation of an underground pipe or channel to convey irrigation
water from the Dam.
With the comments and suggestions of the current Lombardy Company current members,
the Petrovics hired a contractor to clear and clean the Ditch on the purchased 6.271 acre
section adjacent to Rio Frio which amounts to 280 feet from the old Dam. The hired
contractor cleaned out the old Ditch location and installed an 18 inch pipe in the Ditch,
covering the upper section to create water flow from the Dam in 2016. By the
development of a pipe for water flow, the Ditch is now flowing continuously from the Dam,
entering the southern portion of the Ditch in the Wilkison Survey to run continuously about
100 yards to include part of the northern section of the John Metcalf survey A/604.

RIO BELLA / LOMBARDY DITCH
LOMBARDY DITCH
The Lombardy Ditch is an ancient water site that will be 150 years old in 2018, being
created in former Bandera County, now the central area of 1913 Real County. The initial,
northern section of the Ditch location begins in the Rio Bella Resort property adjacent to
the east lower line of Rio Frio creek. The creek was known then as “Cold River” until a
post office opened in 1875, adjacent to the Lombardy Ditch and two miles south of it’s
beginning at the Rio Bella site. The Ditch was originally reported as five feet wide with a
depth from three to four feet finally ranging to ten miles in length. Original plans in 1868
called for the Ditch to be two miles in length. A current report states the original Ditch
was constructed six feet wide at the bottom with a depth of five feet, a width of seven feet
at top and a gradient of 4-1/16 feet in 1000 feet.
Two maps indicating the reservoir, diversion and discharge points are attached in
the local map collection.
The purpose was to provide irrigation water for growing environmental vegetables and
provide water for gristmill, flourmill, cotton-gin and shingle mill operations which were
located far south of the Wilkison Survey. This was to also benefit downstream eastern
survey areas totaling 800 acres and extended six miles all by gravity flow.
Later, from original two miles in length, the canal was extended southward towards the
north section of Uvalde County for about 10 miles. Also reported in 1900, the canal water
had two places channeled through two underground flumes. The water served the
original survey owners for 100 years who settled at the 800 acres of land that has black
and sandy loam land.
A Dam, in continuance today, was created initially as an irrigation canal to provide
continuous water for the hand dug, Lombardy Ditch. The Dam reveals large stones
known today as “rock art” throughout the Rio Frio, east of the Lombardy Ditch. Initially
the Dam was constructed beginning in 1866 measuring thirty feet long and four feet high
across the Frio River, being above the Ditch area. The first Dam was built with brush and
gravel thirty feet long, but later reconstructed of cypress until late in 1920s when a brandnew Dam was constructed out of concrete and steel.
The Rio Bella Resort and Lombardy Ditch are on the section of the eastern headwaters
of the Frio River which is the northern section of the Nueces River. Frio River is located
in the western boundary of present Real County having elevations from 1,500 feet in
valleys to 2,400 feet in the north part of the county at the edge of the plateau. There are
mountains and ridges in the west half of Real County that has Ashe Juniper, Mesquite,
and large series of Cypress trees. During 6,000 to 10,000 years ago the Lipan Apaches,
and Comanche’s inhabited the area, setting trails along both sides of the creeks.
During 1875, W. F. Smith and Theophilus Watkins, both of Uvalde County, and N. M. C.
Patterson of Bandera County received the ownership of the Rio Frio Surveys that

During the year March 1916, The Texas Water Commission issued a Water Permit for
authorization to the Lombardy Irrigation Company to appropriate waters of the State of
Texas as follows:
•
•
•
•

One: Maintain an existing dam and reservoir on the Frio River not to exceed sixacre feet of water.
Two: Divert 3,460 acres feet of water pre-annum and use 1600 acre feet of water
per annum to irrigate 800 acres of land...
Three: Divert water through the canal during times of irrigation and times of no
irrigation.
Four: Water diverted and not used for irrigation shall be returned to the Frio River.

The Lombardy Irrigation Company was sent a Certificate of Adjudication 21-3158, March
11, 1984, for Real and Uvalde Counties as the Frio River is a tributary to the Nueces
River. Larry Nance was President of the Lombardy Irrigation Company working at the
Ditch along Ranch Road 1120, Rio Frio, Texas 78879 during 1984. According to the 1916
Certificate, the 73rd Judicial District Court of Bexar County in Cause No. 82C1-01498
utilized the initial Priority Date as March 31, 1916. According to the Adjudication of Water
Rights in the Frio-Atascosa Rivers Watershed of the Nueces River Basin dated back to
April 12, 1982, a right was recognized under Certified Filing 906 authorizing the Lombardy
Irrigation Company to appropriate waters of the State of Texas as set forth in five terms
and conditions.
One: Impoundment noted the Owner authorized to maintain an existing dam and
reservoir on the Frio River and impound therein not to exceed six acre-feet of water. The
Dam located in the C. J. Wilkinson (WiIkison) Survey No. A/603, Abstract 993 now in Real
County, Texas.
Two: In Use, the owner was authorized to divert 3,460 acre-feet of water per annum out
of the Frio River for use of 1,600 acre-feet of water per annum regarding irrigation for a
maximum of 800 land acres within owner’s service area. The list of surveys lying east of
the Frio River range from the C. J. Wilkison Survey in Real County to include:

In a 2003 investigation of the Ditch, via a Texas A & M group reported the “end of the
water” to be at an area called the “Elephant Grave Yard,” having the dead Cypress Trees.
The owners had cut up the lumber for fire wood, the rest hauled away from the Ditch area.
However, the report noted that the far southern Ditch section found an area of a flowing
Ditch with the area 12 to 14 inches deep and about thirty feet wide.
One year previous, September 22, 2002, the “Frio River Place, Phase One” subdivision
had been surveyed and filed with Real County, along with a map that showed Frio River
to the west, the Ditch running through Blocks 1 and 2 with F. M. 1120 along the east side.

The Petrovics, current owners adjacent to the Dam and beginning Ditch site, have
improved the water flow through the Ditch section. The Dam and starting point of the Ditch
has water running through the underside of the original Ditch in an 18-inch pipe installed
in the original Ditch during early 2017. This was done as the local area old time owners

stated that the water was not running for the last 20-years. In a January 2017 meeting
with the Annual Lombardy Irrigation Company, the Petrovics were told to install a pipe or
a flue if landowners chose to cover sections of the Ditch. As a result of the cleaning out
of the Ditch at the Wilkinson Survey 6.271 acres and installing the 18-inch pipe, the water
is now (December 2017) running continuously in the pipe and coming out approximately
200 plus feet to the south, continuing in the adjacent southern section of the Wilkison
Survey.
As of 2017, the investigation of the lower, southern section of the Ditch almost to Uvalde
currently has about three locations where no water is moving through the Ditch. One
location has covered and closed the Ditch completely with no water running where a
recent house was constructed to the west of the old Ditch. The areas appear to be in the
new housing development. The Cypress Trees have been lost in various places due to
lack of water in the Ditch. Many years ago, it was stated that when the Cypress Trees
died from no water available, they all were cut down. However, large stumps were
reported to be at the Canal site.

HISTORIC DITCH AND DAM DEVELOPMENT IN TEXAS
Lombardy Ditch, beginning with a Dam, was the expansion utilized in western Texas as
irrigation in the art of watering crops via an artificial method. The first irrigation ditches
were dug by Spanish slaves in the latter half of the seventeenth century to serve the
Missions. Several were developed south of El Paso along the Rio Grande creek, running
down to Brownsville. Others followed creeks that provided water throughout each year
and were extended to San Antonio during the 18th century. These Ditches were known
by the Spanish as acequias.
All Spanish and Mexican missions constructed throughout Texas were initiated by ditch
construction in order to provide water by irrigation to the local land to supply vegetables,
coffee, cotton or corn to the missions and townships. Building a Dam for the Spanish
Canals began in the late 1760’s. A Spanish mission has been found formerly located due
west of the Lombardy Ditch at the west river in Camp Wood known as San Lorenzo. Two
were developed in 1762 along the upper Nueces River Canyon, one near the current town
of Montel and the San Lorenzo put twelve miles upstream found at the current town of
Camp Wood. The missions all had ditches for the creeks to provide continuous water to
the Mission and local fields.
Water was and is essential to people and animals for survival, cooking, camping, and
living healthy. The ancient Indians utilized creeks for water throughout the year for
cooking, camping, traveling and developing a permanent community living site within
about two acres from the water source, at an up-stream site. Pueblo Indians that
constructed permeant homesteads were initiated at a high location of a small mountain

and would usually develop their home site on the eastern portion of a high hill or small
mountain.
In addition to locating creeks, the Indians developed trails for traveling along each side of
the creeks. Nearly every creek in Texas, over 2,000 years ago, had a trail on either side
of regular, full- time creeks. The trail was utilized on the edge of a group of trees that
grew along the edge of the water line. Many times, the trees ranged about a half to full
mile adjacent to the creek, creating a tree-line between a prairie and the creek. In eastern
Texas, the tree group included Hickory, Pine, Oak and Cedar. Buffalo Bayou, up-stream
at Houston, Texas had large five-foot diameter Magnolias along both side of the old
bayou. Real County’s western creek still has the original large Cypress trees filling both
sides of the creek.
Temporary camp sites were made by Indians at areas that were high, above and adjacent
to creeks. This allowed a traveling group to collect and assemble fish and food along the
trail camp site. Their more permanent camp sites generally sat at a high mountain
location that ranged within several miles of creeks. The camp sites provided areas for
cooking fish and food retrieved from the nearby creek. Hunting buffalos during the year
depended on the direction of the buffalos. In the winter time, the buffalos traveled to
southern Texas, then move far north during summer time.
When the Spanish visited southern United States, they frequently traveled on the trails
established by the Native Americans and utilized the old camp sites along the creeks.
However, the Spanish and French would only visit the permanent living areas of the
Natives, as some were still in use by the Natives during the 1500 to 1700’s.
The site of Real County has been documented by the Texas Archeologist Society, as
being occupied by Comanche Indians, as the best-known tribes. The Coahuiltecan tribes
have been reported to the south of Real County with the Apaches to the west and
Tonkawa tribes to the east. The Apaches, at one time, had dominated almost all of West
Texas, extending from Arkansas to Arizona. The Comanche dominated North, Central
and West Texas, known to have bands controlling trade for production of Buffalo products
and horses. A peace treaty was negotiated by the Spanish with the Native Americans in
1785, but that did not stop the Comanche’s from raiding Spanish and American settlers.
During the 1830s, the Comanche’s continued raiding until the State President, Mirabeau
B. Lamar, developed a policy to drive the Comanche’s northward across the upper Red
River.
After Texas became a U.S. State in 1847, the Comanche’s began dying out and many
were moved to a reservation in Oklahoma. Some, however, remained active and
hindered an attempt at the white settlements in Real County, being westward of the Texas
Hill Country. By 1870, Buffalos as well as local horses were unavailable to the Natives,
who then moved to Lawton, Oklahoma, giving up on southern Texas.

The surveys along Rio Frio were issued by Bexar County beginning in 1838, to several
people living in Fort Bend County. The formal patent of the Wilkison Survey was not
issued until 1847, when Texas became part of the United States. By 1862, Bexar County
had issued over sixty surveys along Frio River Creek running from upper Uvalde County
to the northern end of Rio Frio Creek located in Edwards County. The same occurred to
the western section along the Nueces River. By 1860s, no other surveys were developed
between any creeks or not utilizing creeks for surveys.
See adjacent maps of the 1862 surveys along Rio Frio Creek and Nueces River.
Development and occupation of the Rio Frio area surveys were purchased by people
living in other Texas Counties and different States, avoiding occupation of the site until
after the Civil War, or about the 1866 to 1872 time period.
Therefore, the Rio Bella Resort on the Frio, having the Frio River Dam, along with the
start of the Lombardy Ditch, provides the visual history of Spanish Texas development of
Dams and acequia’s to support Missions. Two Missions have been located in Real
County western section along the Nueces River. One is located at the township of Camp
Wood.
Most of the Texas Spanish Dams and ditches were destroyed and covered over in the
1790s. However, a ditch inside the San Antonio Alamo site can still be seen. The 1700
routes that lead across southern and western Texas in the Spanish days converged in
San Antonio where a Ditch and Dams were constructed to support San Antonio’s Alamo
Mission and township.

HISTORY OF 6.271 ACRES IN CHRISTOPHER J. WILKISON #603 A/933.#1572 OF
320 ORIGINAL SURVEY ACRES.
Christopher J. Wilkison (Jr.) had arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana on September 24,
1827 on a ship named “Mary Hobin,” by way of Havana, Cuba from Pennsylvania; He
was listed as a Captain, in the United States Military Service. When arriving in New
Orleans, he was listed as 36 years old, having lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania until
1820 with his family and father who was named Christopher also. Father Christopher had
married in England and moved to the United States by 1810. Frequently, the name
Wilkison is spelled Wilkenson or Wilkinson throughout the 1900’s and 2000’s. Many 2017
current notes are utilizing the spelling as Wilkinson instead of Wilkison. Christopher J.
Wilkison moved into Texas by 1835 to the Fort Bend County area.
In 1836, Bexar County began issuing acreage to single men who were required to
immigrate to Texas after October 1, 1837 and before January 1, 1840. This Third Class
Headright for single men was applied to Christopher J. Wilkison on December 14, 1839
and acknowledged he was over 17 years old and a actual resident of Fort Bend County.
Testimony of his statements was signed by James C. Johnson and Joseph T. Johnson.

The Patent as issued to him in Fort Bend County by the Republic of Texas. When
Wilkison received the 320-acres, he was 45 years old. The land was located 75 miles
northwest of San Antonio and surveyed on both sides of the Rio Frio Creek. The State
was surveying land on both sides of the creek and approximately 320 acres for each one.
The issues for land to new Texas immigrants had started at the northern edge of each
creek in what is now Real County.
Once the Bandera Pass, in 1841, became in charge of a Texas Ranger Company, who
fought and won against the Comanche group, fewer Native Americans came through the
area of Rio Frio Canyon.
Sometime after Wilkison received the 320-acre site, he passed away before August 2,
1842. At that time the Fort Bend County Probate Court ordered the Clerk of Court to sell
the property. William H. Battle who was the local Clerk of Fort Bend County bid for $12.48
for the 320 acres and received the sale.
On June 9, 1845, William H. Battle, stated he had become the assignee of deceased
Christopher J. Wilkison. At that time, the County of Fort Bend stated that Battle was
entitled to an unconditional Headright being the Wilkison land and that Battle became the
purchaser and owner of the 320 acres through a Deed Certificate. At that time the current
Clerk and Board Commissioner was Mills M. Battle. The certification was signed by Chief
Judge C. C. Dyon, Executive Officer, Fred Bend and Attorney, Thomas M. Geo.
On January 4, 1847, the State of Texas General Land Office issued a Patent as Abstract
993 and 1572 for Christopher J. Wilkison with William H. Battle as his assignee. The
Patent noted that the survey was in “Section No. 6, situated in the Valley Solinall on the
Rio Frio about 75 miles west of San Antonio in Bexar County.”
The Patent was
accomplished at that time by the Bexar District surveyor, John James, having previously
surveyed the site as No. 603 while utilizing two chain carriers.
Battle had received a State Patent in his name along the Rio Frio Creek, as the third
survey to the south of Wilkison Survey, named W. H. Battle Survey is #606, 3-271 for 640
acres. Battle was born in North Carolina in 1817 and married a Florida lady in the 1842
time period in Texas. He moved to Fort Bend area in Texas before the end of 1839. Up
to 1850 he resided in Fort Bend County. By 1860, Battle had moved with his family to
Gonzales County where his 17 year old son became a Stock-Keeper for him.
Nine months after receiving the Wilkison Survey, October 1, 1847, William H. Battle of
Fort Bend County, sold the 320 Patented Wilkison acres to John H. Herndon of Travis
County. Within two years, on November 30, 1850, John H. Herndon appointed John
James as his attorney to sell, alien and convey by Warranty Deed all lands belonging to
him situated in Bexar and other Counties. The designation was filed in Bandera County
as well in Bexar County by 1854. John James was 36 years old, born in England in 1814.
Four years later, in 1858, Bandera County was set up by the State being previously a
Bexar County area. The initial settlement developed around Rio Frio as surveys, was

completed throughout the upper part of the creek between 1856 and 1860. Baptist
preacher, Andrew Jackson Potter came to Rio Frio site in 1859 for a congregation,
indicating settlers were then residing in the area along Rio Frio Creek. In 1856, John and
Nancy Leakey settled at the Frio River Canyon Area with a home and sawmill. Later
moving northward to establish the town of Leakey.
John H. Herndon had purchased several hundred surveys in 1847 that were located in
northwestern portion of the area, then called Bexar County. This was prior to the 1858
dedication of Bandera and many other counties by Bexar County.
John H. Herndon re-appointed Joseph C. Herndon, as his lawful attorney to sell the
Warranty Deeds owned by Herndon. John Herndon also appointed John James as his
attorney to sell Warranty Deeds. By June 7 of 1856 John H. Herndon sold 107 acres out
of the C. J. Wilkison Survey #603 to John Davenport. As Herndon had acquired the
southern 320 acres survey of John Metcalf #604, he sold 107 acres to Davenport at the
same time. During the Civil War, J. B. Davenport along with Theo. Watkins and Captain
Theophilus Watkins compiled a muster roll of Home Guards in 18 September 1864. The
General Headquarters was at Camp Blanco near Uvalde. At that time, J. B. Davenport
served in Squad No. 1 in Uvalde.
M. M. Davenport was 32 years by 1882, having married about 1871 in Texas with John
C. Davenport. BY 1880, they had three daughters, ages 2, 6, and 8 with one son age 4.
Brother, F. M. Davenport, age 30, was living with John and M. M. in 1880 when John was
37 and M. M. had reached 30 years old. John listed himself as being a Grocer in 1880
living in Uvalde.

BANDERA COUNTY, TEXAS CREATED IN 1858
Bexar County set up a series of new Counties, by 1858, which included the upper section
of Rio Frio as Bandera County. The western area that included Nueces River was set up
as Edwards County. The Nueces River now formed the western side of Real County,
along with Rio Frio. Settlement began in the 1856 along the Rio Frio, but mostly in the
present town of Leakey. Following the Civil War, Smith and Watkins began development
of the Lombardy ditch.
The title records of Bandera County have the purchase of Christopher J. Wilkison Survey
by William F. Smith of Uvalde County as June 7, 1872, which is four years following the
report of the ditch created east of Rio Frio. The ownership to Smith was instituted by
Attorney John James who had filed a lawsuit, by Frederick J. Calvit, for the land of John
H. Herndon, that included the Wilkison survey and the John Metcalf survey that is
adjacent to the south of the Wilkison site.

RIO BELLA / LOMBARDY DITCH
W. F. Smith, Newman Patterson and Theophilus Watkins arrived to Rio Frio Creek to
initiate construction of a gravity-flow irrigation canal east and along the creek for about
two miles starting in the southern part of Christopher J. Wilkison Survey.
Due to the Bankruptcy of John H. Herndon by 1872, the sale of John Herndon land in
#603, Wilkinson Survey and #604 Metcalf Survey were sold by Attorney John James for
Frederick J. Calvit. Calvit had the Bankruptcy of Herndon surveys transferred to his
name. In June 1872, Calvit sold both tracts to William F. Smith of Uvalde County who
paid a total of $640 for the two surveys.
At this time, the Lombardy Irrigation Canal was supported at Rio Frio by the Church
converted into a Mission to serve the Mexicans living nearby, the tenant farmers and
migrant ranch workers whose labor was supporting the local economy. Farming became
supplanted along the Frio River by raising of Angora Goats. However raids by Comanche,
Apache and Lipan Apache Indians against the White settlers continued along the creek
area until after 1881.
In 1874, Watkins, Smith and Patterson filed for a charter for the Lombardy Irrigation
Company that was granted in 1875. As a result, cotton, corn, oats, tobacco and wheat
raised on the small irrigation tracts required the future owners to be responsible for the
maintenance of the new ditch canal.
The Lombardy Ditch constructors had obviously observed the Sam Antonio Alamo Ditch
in Bexar County. The three men combined to become the owners of the Lombardy Ditch
and Dam and purchased the survey areas between 1866 to the 1870s. W. F. Smith,
Theopolis Watkins and N. M. C. Patterson became partners to form and charter the
Lombardy Irrigation Company in 1875.
W.F. Smith of Uvalde County had acquired eight of the Frio Rio Creek Surveys, so he
deeded the surveys on August 17, 1875 to the Lombardy Company which included W. F.
Smith, Theophilus Watkins and Newman M. C. Patterson. He conveyed 31 acres to J.W.
Watkins for a homestead and 36 3/10 acres for N. M. C. Patterson homestead. Other
than the reserved homesteads, the balance of the seven surveys was conveyed as an
undivided 1/3 of all the aforesaid property to Smith, Watkins and Patterson. The
comprised irrigation ditch, the Irrigated Farm Mill and other improvements of the Ditch
were issued to the Lombardy Company with Smith, Watkins and Patterson designated as
direct charter members and part of the legal title.
Two years after Smith purchased the 320 acres of the Wilkison survey, Newman
Patterson and F. Smith filed for a charter as the Lombardy Irrigation Company. It was
granted in 1876 and a Post Office was set up south of the Wilkison survey in the area
now known as the Rio Fro Community. With the establishment of the Lombardy Ditch,
a number of people began to move into the area to receive small amounts of irrigation for
development growth. Water adoption by users included maintenance of the canal by
each irrigation user.

In August 1875, Uvalde County resident W. F. Smith comprised the improvements, as
well as the areas of seven surveys along the ditch, including Theophilus Watkins and N.
M. C. Patterson.
The deed that conveyed one undivided 1/3 of all the surveys along the Rio Frio Ditch that
included 320 acres of C. J. Wilkison (No. 603), 320 acres of J. Metcalf No. 604, 640 acres
of Adam Hagan No. 607, 640 acres of John E. Lewis No. 608, 1/3 of 640 acres of William
Lewis No. 610, 640 acres of George Dietz No. 611 and 640 acres of I. L. Ewing No. 612.
The Lombardy Ditch Company developers, Theophilus Watkins, Newman M. C.
Patterson and Wilkins maintained 20 to 30 acres of family residence out of the designation
of the land to Lombardy Irrigation Company. Via tax records, 1879 to 1903, the Lombardy
Ditch maintained the surveys.
However, Theophilus Watkins (1819-1883) died in 1883 at age 44. He had been an
irrigation pioneer, born in Kentucky and had married Susan Williams, having one
daughter. Susan died soon after the birth of the daughter. After his wife’s death, Watkins
moved to Texas in 1845 living in Sabinal with his brother, Charles Watkins. In 1858, after
moving to California and back to Kentucky, he returned to Texas as a captain at Fort Inge
near Uvalde. He and his company protected the area from Indian attacks at the Leona
River. Leona River joined the Rio Frio River far south near U.S. Highway 81 being about
seven miles north of Dilley.
In 1867, Charles Watkins married second wife Frances Anna E. Mosely. They had six
children. He then settled in the valley of Frio River, Frio Canyon and became an associate
of W. F. Smith and Newman Patterson for the ten miles ditch. He reported the ditch five
feet wide with depth ranging from three to four feet with water coming from a Dam
constructed with brush and gravel across the Frio River.
Following ACEQUIA PARK in Bexar County, the missionaries and Mission Indians had
constructed the San Antonio Acequias Ditches to supply each Mission and local fields
with drinking and irrigation water diverted from the San Antonio River. The Lombardy
ditch dug in Real County is similar in size and utilization with the Spanish ditches
constructed during the 1700 time in Bexar County.
For many years, up to the 1885 time period, N. M. C. Patterson, James B. Davenport and
C. Theophilus Watkins continued ownership of the Wilkinson survey with 107 acres each
person.
N M C Patterson died in 1915 age 90 years in Uvalde at Ro Frio. He had begun work in
1850 as a Farmer born in Alabama about 1826. He had just married to Lucy Ann, born
in Tennessee, age 18 in 1848. They had they first son, John W. Patterson, born in January
1850. Ten years later, in 1860, Newman and his wife Lucy Ann had four boys ages, 3, 5,
8 and 10 years old. By 1870 one daughter had been born. Throughout his time as a
farmer, he continued working in the Wilkison Survey where he had 107 acres. Obviously,
Patterson took care of the original Dam and Ditch area to maintain flowing water

for many years.
W. F. Smith had sold the 107 acres out of C. J. Wilkison Survey to M. M. and James B.
Davenport, between 1876- 1878. Smith was reported born September 18, 1846 and died
on July 7 1887, being buried in Round Rock Cemetery. In the 1860s, James Davenport
and his wife Leslie lived in Uvalde County with their older sons, age 19 and 17 having
been born in Missouri during prior to 1840. By 1880 James Davenport was 61 years old
still as a Farmer, born in Virginia in 1819. He had married an older lady born in 1808 in
Virginia. When owning a portion of the Wilkison Survey, the family lived in Bandera
County near the Rio Frio.
In October 1882, James B. Davenport sold the 107 acres of Wilkison survey to W. M. and
William Davenport and re-filed the sale in October 1883. Shortly afterward, the two
Davenports sold the 107 Wilkison acreage to W. C. Haby and his wife. Up through 1900,
C. T. Watkins and N. M. C Patterson maintained their single ownerships of each having
17 acres in the C. J. Wilkison survey. Following Watkins death in 1883, his wife F. A. E.
Watkins maintained the 107 acreage in her name until 1903.
On June 4, 1903, the lower case of the T. Watkins heirs included Mrs. Amelln Patterson,
N. M. C Patterson, F. A. E Watkins (widow), D. B. Patterson, Arabella Patterson, John L.
Watkins, W. Bennie, Johanna Bennie, Mand Watkins, Charlie Watkins, J. F. Pike, Sallie
Pike and Ophelia Watkins. The group sold the Wilkinson Survey #603 along with the John
Metcalf #604 survey located on the waters of the Frio River in Bandera County.
Three years later, December 1, 1906, the same group re-filed the identical former sale of
Wilkison and Metcalf surveys, being 220 acres total, to include Mrs. Arabella Patterson in
the ownership.
Within another three years, May 11 1909, the Patterson family living at Rio Frio sold 100
acres of the C. J. Wilkison survey to William Haby and wife Mamie Haby of Bandera
County for $6900 with a $4000 receipt and one vendor lien note. By June 13 of 2013,
the vendor’s lien was cancelled by W. B. Patterson having been paid in full by William
and wife Mamie Haby.

REAL COUNTY TEXAS CREATED IN 1913
Real County was created from Edwards County located west of Bandera County and the
western portion of Bandera County as well as part of Kerr County. The new county
became created in April 3, 1913 and was organized on July 26, 1913. The name Real
was made in honor of Julius Real (1860-1944) who was a prominent businessman and a
Texas State Senator from 1909 to 1914 and again 1924 to 1928.
William Haby and wife Mamie Haby lived in Real County and owned 107 acres of C .J.

Haby and his wife sold 3 & 3/10 acres for $330 out of the C. J. Wilkison survey on March
19, 1932 to Mrs. Cornelia Cavender. Seven years later, Cornelia Cavender, with her
husband J. M. Cavender sold the 3 3/10 acres to Mrs. Ralph DeWitt on August 26, 1939.
The deed noted that the sale of the property did not include the water rights used by
Lombardy Irrigation System or effect the water rights and easements containing the dam,
right of ways, canals, water, etc. that are now in possession and being used by the
Lombardy Irrigation System.
Thirteen years later, June 22, 1945, William and Mamie Haby, still living in Real County,
sold an additional 1.5 acres to Mrs. Ralph DeWitt noted as part of Haby homestead tract
of 200 acres in survey #603 C.J. Wilkison. Six months later, another 1.5 acre purchase

of survey #603 patented to Christopher J. Wilkison. The tract was located adjacent to the
1.5 acres purchased in June 1945 by Mrs. DeWitt from the Haby family.
The DeWitt family, being Ralph and Estelle Dowson DeWitt with son Joe, moved to Frio
Canyon in 1939 to settle on the Frio River between Rio Frio and Leaky. Their first
purchase was from Haby family for the Haby homestead. After time, they sold a small
portion of the survey, on March 4, 1946, to Emma Shipp and Oran Shipp in the north area
of the Wilkison survey and adjacent northward to the DeWitt land. The Haby family had
