A HISTORY OF THE HOXIE SAN GABRIEL RANCH

Introduction
On the afternoon of Thursday, March 31, 1938, Th~ TayZor
DaiZy Press announced that one of Williamson Countyrs historic
landmarks bad burned at 10:00 that morning. Located approximately ten miles northeast of Taylor, the now-destroyed Hoxie
House (Sunnyside) was noted in the paper as having been a
"pioneer landmark" and "social center" which was· constructed
originally by John R. Hoxie of Chicago; purchased in 1910 by
F.L. Welch and F.A. Allison; and in recent years, used by a
series of tenant farmers.
The article, although essentially correct, only hinted at
the importance of the Hoxie House and San Gabriel Ranch, for
by the 1930's all the characters who had played significant
roles in its purchase and development were long dead. Indeed,
it was clear from the tone of the article that even by 1938
the Hoxie San Gabriel Ranch had become something of an enigma.
The land which comprised the ranch was a grant on which the
owner never lived; the house itself was only rarely occupied
by the family that built it. In sum, the house and land together had come to represent a property of convenience more
noteworthy for the persons associated with it than for the
structure itself which, although architecturally outst~nding
at the time of its construction, eventually became a victim
of its owners' neglect.
The history of the Hoxie San Gabriel Ranch began long
before John R~ Hoxie obtained the property, and it involved at
various times a citizen of Mexico named Pedro Zarza; a famous
early Texas doctor, Asa Hoxey of Washington County; one of the
foremost figures in the development of railroads in America,
H.M. Hoxie; the richest man in Williamson County, and a
successful Fort Worth and Chicago financier, John R. Hoxie;
and various Williamson County businessmen who purchased the
land for subdivision in 1910.
In 1830 when the story of the ranch began, the land that
lay within its borders was located on the south bank of

1

2

the San Gabriel River at the mouth of Williamson Creek
(Fig. 1). According to the surveyor, Francis Johnson, the
grant (approximately 26,570 acres) was composed of one league
of arable land and five leagues of pasture, and thus ideally
suited to the uses to which its first owner, Pedro Zarza,
proposed to put it. 1 It was well-watered, grassy land, that
was bounded by property owned by Citizens Miguel Davilla and
Rafael de Aguirre.
·
f830-1876: Beginnings
In May of 1830, Zarza, a citizen of Villa Aldama, Nuevo
Leon, Mexico, applied for a grant of eleven leagues to which
he claimed to be entitled according to the provisions of
Article 24 of the State Colonization Law of March 24, 1825.
This law was promulgated to encourage the orderly settlement
of Coahuila and Texas by groups of foreigners and empresarios,
and to fill the empty treasury of the State by the sale of 400
leagues. Foreigners were entitled to settle freely in the
country, and empresarios were allowed to bring in families at
profit to themselves. However, the government reserved the
right to sell only to Mexican citizens blocks of land which
came to be known as eleven-league grants.
Speculation in Texas land, such as occurred with the Pedro
Zarza Grant, seems to have developed from this right of the
government to sell to Mexicans. The first sale was made in
1828 to Juan Antonio Padillo. Then, in 1830, James Bowie went
to Saltillo and returned with over a dozen of the grants which
he had induced Mexican citizens to apply for, and then sell to
him. Other Mexicans saw the potential for profit and also applied for eleven-league grants (Barker 1906: 76-77).
It is very likely that the Zarza Grant fell into this category, for despite his statement to the Mexican government
Information in this report which deals with the boundaries and
chain of title to the Hoxie San Gabriel Ranch is taken, either
by summary or quote, from the Abstract of Title No. 42146-4
Williamson County, Texas, compiled by the Guarantee Abstract
Company, Inc., Georgetown, Texas.

Texas.

that he needed the lands "for farming and stock raising," and
his offer to "settle and cultivate [the land] in the manner and
form prescribed by the law ... " there is no evidence that Zarza
ever set foot on his six leagues on the San Gabriel, four leagues
on the Brazos, or one league on Cow Bayou lying within the Austin
and Williams Colony.
Indeed, even before the land formally was granted to him,
Zarza had vested his power of attorney in Thomas F. McKinney,
a native of Kentucky, member of the -Austin Colony, and leading
financier of the Texas Revolution. He gave McKinney the power
to take possession of the eleven leagues of land granted to him
by the Governor of Coahuila, and empowered McKinney "to alienate said eleven leagues of land, providing judicially to whom
and at what price he has sold them, and the class of lands."
Before he could dispose of the grant to a likely buyer, however, McKinney vested the power of attorney that had been granted to him by Zarza in a prominent lawyer, Robert M. Williamson.
On April 5, 1833, McKinney appeared before Luke Lesassier in
San Felipe de Austin and stated that he was turning his power
of attorney over to Williamson, obligating Zarza's property,
and enabling him, in short, to dispose of the land just as Zarza
had instructed him to do earlier.
It could not have been mere coincidence that Williamson had
been communicating for months with the man who became the next
owner of the Zarza Grant. As early as December 1832, Williamson
had received a letter from Dr. Asa Hoxey 2 of Montgomery, Alabama,
in which Hoxey referred to an increasing interest in Texas lands:
You mentioned in your last letter
that you bel[i]eved Mexican grants
of Eleven leagues could be procured
for a reasonable sumf.] [I]f so
you will perce[i]ve by the enclosed
proposition that Mr[~] Edward Hanrick[,] George Whitman and myself
are disposed to procure some of them[,]
the selections of which will be left
entirely to your own discretion[,] and

The name is spelled both "Hoxey" and "Hoxie."

5

should you be disposed to take up
with the proposition I feel satisfied that we will be well pleased
with your selections[.] (Texas State
Historical Association 1906: 285).
Of all the individuals who were ever associated with the
land on the San Gabriel, Dr. Asa Hoxey was one of the most outstanding. A native of Georgia, Hoxey was at the height of his
financial and professional powers wben he made the decision to
move to Texas. A member of an old New England family, he soon
established a reputation in his new home for his political, as
well as medical, abilities.
Hoxey's ancestry dated from the 1650's, when Lodowich Hoxie
arrived in America and settled in Sandwich, Plymouth Colony. 3
Asa was descended from Lodowich's son, Gideon, and was the
first generation of his family to spend his entire life outside
New England. He was born on February 22, 1800, in Savannah,
Georgia, and graduated in 1820 from the University of Georgia.
After graduating from the medical department of the University
of New York in 1822, he married Elizabeth Bennett of Connecticut, and returned south to Montgomery, where he practiced medicine from 1823 to 1833. His letter to Williamson indicated
that he had an active interest in Texas lands as early as 1832,
and so his move to Washington County was a predictable one.
After locating near the future site of Independence, he settled
down to large-scale farming and land trading, apparently becoming more interested in speculation and politics than in his
original career of medicine (Nixon 1946: 352-353; Kemp n.d.).
By 1835, Hoxey was involved deeply in the movement for
Texas independence, having been chosen, in late 1835, to be a
delegate to the General Consultation at San Felipe, and having
participated in the Siege of Bexar in December of the same year
(TeZegraph and Texas Register, November 7, 1835). After the
war he developed an abiding interest in education, and became
renown not only for his personal library, but for his efforts
in 1837 to organize Independence Academy (forerunner to Baylor
University) (Gammel 1898: 1295-1296; TeZegraph and Texas Register, July 29, 1837).

3

A complete, if not always reliable, genealogy of the Hoxie
(Hoxey) family has been compiled and published by Leslie R.
Hoxie (1950).

6

In 1838, the same year he was apeointed medical censor for
the senatorial district of Washington (Telegraph and Texas Register, May 16, 1838), Hoxey purchased the eleven-league Zarza
Grant from Robert M. Williamson who was acting as agent for
Pedro Zarza. The grant was described as including six leagues
situated in the counties of Milam and Williamson. It was
located on the San Gabriel and Williamson creeks, and adjoined
an eleven-league parcel owned by Miguel Davilla and a tenleague parcel owned by Rafael de Aguirre.
For all his apparent interest in obtaining the Zarza Grant,
however, Asa Hoxey, like his predecessor, never lived on the
San Gabriel land he had waited so long to purchase. Personal
affairs and close ties to his home in Washington County appear
to have kept him from becoming personally involved with the
grant, and his neglect of it was very likely the reason he was
forced to evict trespassers from the property, and to file suit
to clear his title in 1856. 5
On May 20, 1863, Asa Hoxey died, leaving a wife, Elizabeth,
and two children, Thomas R. Hoxey and Sarah Ann Hubert Williams.
His wife was named executrix of his will. A scant two-and-onehalf years later, on November 15, 1864, Elizabeth Hoxey died,
leaving Sarah Ann and James M. Williams as executors of a tangled confusion of money, property, and numerous relatives. Washington County properties, for example, had been left to Sara Ann
Williams, while pieces of the Zarza Grant had been left to
Lucinda Perry and Harriet Wilson. More than one-half dozen other
4
A censor was an examiner who had the power to distribute
medical licenses.
Other censors included Ashbel Smith,
George W. Hill, and R.A. Irion (Telegraph and Texas Register,
May 16, 1838).
The rest of Hoxey's medical activities seem
to have been restricted to the treatment of famous political
figures.
On March 4, 1841, the Texas Sentinel reported: "We
are much gratified to state that the health of gen.[sia] Lamar,
who is still at doctor Hoxey's, near Washington, has much
improved."
5
Hoxey also was neglectful of other pieces of property, possibly because he owned so many of them.
Public notices in the
Texas Sentinel for August 19, 1841, pointed out that property
belonging to Asa Hoxey on the west side of San Marcus[sic]
Spring had been seized for delinquent public and county taxes,
and that he owed still more taxes on property in Robertson County.

7

parties laid claim to the rest of the 13,284 acres of Williamson County land lying within the Zarza Grant. 6
Litigation over the two wills was long and complex, with
the legal heirs being named in March 1875 as Thomas R., Inez,
Tacitus, Asa, Thomas, and Bessie Belle Hoxie; Sara Ann Williams;
and Leila Love. By 1876, however, the estate was settled at
last, and the heirs began to dispose of their shares almost
immediately.
·
1876-1910: Development of the Hoxie San Gabriel Ranch
The thirty-odd years between 1876, when Asa Hoxey's heirs
began to sell the Zarza Grant, and the new owners sold their
shares in 1910, were the most eventful in the history of the
Hoxie San Gabriel Ranch. Their importance stems from three
factors: first, for the first time in its history, the land
that comprised the ranch was developed and used for the raising
of sheep, cattly, horses, and crops; second, Hoxie House was
constructed; and third, ownership and management of the ranch
passed to three members of the Hoxie fami1y--Herbert M., John
R., and Mortimer R.--all of whom were important figures on the
state and national scenes.
The genealogical relationship of the new owners to Asa Hoxie
is a clear one, with H.M. and John R. being second cousins to
Asa. But how those two residents of Iowa and Chicago ever found
out that the land which comprised the ranch was available is one
of the great mysteries surrounding the property. 7
6
Claimants included, among others, Asa Hoxey Willie, Asa Hoxey's
nephew and future congressman (Speer 1881: 138-140; Brown 189-:
382); and members of the Allison family--Andrew, Jemima, Emily,
John, James, and William.

7
Herbert M. and John R. Hoxie's great grandfather, Cornelius
Hoxie, was Asa Hoxey's grandfather. Mortimer was John R.'s
nephew.
It would be interesting to locate the family correspondence that must have passed between the two branches of the
family, but H. M. Hoxie's only child died before adolescence.
Mortimer left one son, Thomas, who was a businessman in the
Electra-Wichita Falls area around 1910-1920; and John R. had
three children, John R., Jr., Gilbert H., and Anna C., one of
whose descendents may live in the Seattle, Washington, area
(Loggie: April 20, 1976; Hoxie 1950: 139).

8

Herbert M. (Hub) Hoxie, who was the first member of the
family to buy into the ranch, was born on December 18, 1840, in
Palmyra, New York, to Benjamin and Ruth (Peck) Hoxie. When his
father moved to Des Moines, Iowa, in the early 1840's to become
a farmer, H.M. became a citizen of that small frontier community. After his father's death, he participated, unsuccessfully,
in the California gold rush, later returning to Iowa to work
for Thomas Mitchell near the small community of Apple Grove
(Williams 1954: 321-330; Andrews 195_4: 331-336). In his native
Iowa, he had made a reputation for being an outstanding politician, railroadman, and business leader, although by the time of
his purchase of the property on the San Gabriel, he was a resident of Palestine, Texas.
In the years preceding and during the Civil War, Hoxie acquired the political connections and business interests that
eventually made him one of the most renown managers in the annals of American railroading. In 1856, he was· elected clerk of
the district court, and a few years later, chairman of the Republican county committee. In 1860, he became secretary of the
Republican state central committee, and through contacts made
with important political figures in that position, was appointed United States marshal in 1861.
Hoxie was a strong abolitionist, and during his tenure as
marshal, he not only ran an underground railroad for runaway
slaves, but he also spearheaded a movement to break up the activities of the Knights of the Golden Circle, a pro-slavery
organization that was sympathetic to the Southern cause. 8 He
aided the Union Army by managing the repair of railroad lines,
and through his connections with Grenville M. Dodge, became an
employee of the Union Pacific Railroad after the Civil War
(U.S. War Department 1880: ser, 1, v. 38, pt. ~' 564-565).
In 1864, Hoxie became involved in the Credit Mobilier
scandal
when he agreed to build a portion of the Union Pacific
road. 9 However, his involvement seems to have had no effect
Hoxie's highly controversial activities during this period
are chronicled in the War of the Rebellion (U.S. War Department
1880: ser. 1, v. 8, 518-519; ser. 2, v. 2, 113-114, 1321-1345;
ser. 2, v. 4, 567-568; ser. 3, v. 3, 66-73).
9

Hoxie was awarded a contract in August 1864 to lay the first
________l_O_O_m_i_l_es of ~~!ck__ at the exh~rbitant sum of $50_,0Q_Q___per mile,

9

on the future success of his career. He went to work for the
International Railway Company, chartered in 1870, and became
general superintendent by 1872, a job he continued to hold
after the International merged with the Houston and Great Northern to form the International and Great Northern Railroad
(Missouri Pacific Lines, April 9, 1976). Three years later, he
was elected a director of that railroad at a Houston meeting
(DaZZas Herald, April 17, 1875).
In 1876, Hoxie's interests diver~ified, and he began to
speculate in land development and town-building. With R.S.
Hayes, he founded the Taylor townsite in the early summer
months, and named it in honor of Moses Taylor of New York, a
director of the International and Great Northern (The Dallas
Morning News, January 27, 1887).
1876 also saw the beginning of Hoxie's involvement with the
Zarza Grant, as he became the first member of his branch of the
family to purchase a part of Asa Hoxey's land. In November, he
bought 340 acres from Mrs. Harriet E. Wilson, one of Elizabeth
Hoxey's heirs, for $800, all of the acreage being located on
the San Gabriel River. Simultaneously, he was busy throughout
the state, running the affairs of the I.& G.N., from which position he oversaw construction of lines throughout Texas (Missouri
Pacific Lines, April 9, 1976).
In 1880, Hoxie was appointed general manager of the new
Texas and Pacific Railway, a position he held in addition to all
his other responsibilities. He also found time to encourage
further settlement and town-building on railroad lines, being on
the executive committee of the Southwestern Immigration Company
(Taylor 1969: 289), and co-authoring, with Allen McCoy, the
booklet, Homes in Texas on the Line of the International and
Great Northern Railroad 1880-1881.

Between 1880 and his death on November 23, 1886, H.M. Hoxie
lived at a dizzying pace. On April 5, 1880, he became second
vice-president of the I.& G.N.; a year later he also was manager
of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railroad (Fort Worth
a job the chief engineer testified could be done for $20,000
per mile. Hoxie then turned over his contract to the Credit
Mobilier of America, and received in return $5,000 cash and
$10,000 stock in the Union Pacific Company (Younger 1955:168169).

10

Daily Demoarat, September 8, 1881); and in December he was
appointed director of the East Line Railroad:a a Wise County
track (Dallas HePald, December 8, 1881). In April of 1881, he
was elected director of the Trinity & Sabine Railroad (Dallas
Herald, April 12, 1883); and in October, became one of the
promoters, along with the Farwells of Chicago, of the Austin
& Oatmanville Railway Company, incorporated to furnish yranite
£or the building of the Texas Capitol (Reed 1941: 323). 0 In
the spring of 1886, shortly before his death, Hoxie reached
the height of his prestige, being appointed to the board of
directors of the I. & G.N. in March, and becoming first vicepresident, director, and member of the executive committee in
April.

In spite of his intense raiiroading activities, Hoxie managed
to keep his hand in at the San Gabriel Ranch, by now largely
owned by his cousin, John R. Hoxie. Indeed, even though he had
sold his original holdings of 340 acres on June 23, 1877, and
had established his residence in Palestine, he remained active
in stock-raising. On March 30, 1881, he purchased from C~L.
Fowzer, Sr., approximately 200 head of cattle (part thoroughbreds and part half-breeds and Texas stock), and Fowzer's
marks (a crop on the right ear and over bit on the left) and
brands (l!Ji tf) (Williamson County Records b: 255-256). In
addition, he marketed cattle, selling what the Dallas Herald
described as a "fine herd" to W.W. Mifford for $10,000 (March
23, 1882).
H.M. Hoxie's attempts at cattle raising were far outshown
by those of his cousin and owner of the Pedro Zarza Grant,
John R. Hoxie. Interested in cattle breeding and the marketing
of livestock since the early 1870's, John R~ Hoxie was to sperid
more time than any of his relatives in acquiring the Zarza land
from Asa Hoxey's heirs, putting it to use for cultivation and
grazing, and finally, building a house there, which, if it
·never served as a home to his family, became a symbol to the
nearby Taylor community of the Hoxies' wealth and prestige.
10
Unfortunately, neither Hoxie nor the Farwells tested the
granite prior to building the railroad, and not until after it
was built did they discover that the stone in their quarry did
not meet the architect's specifications.

11

John R. Hoxie, the individual who masterminded the development of the San Gabriel Ranch, was born on December 13, 1831,
in Macedon, New York, to Cornelius and Ann (Brawnell) Hoxie.
He attended Maced6n Academy briefly, but soon left his home to
follow a career in railroading. From the start, he showed
interests in stockraising, railroading, and banking. One of
his first jobs was as a sub-contractor on the Niagara Falls,
and later, the Staten Island railroads. In Rochester, he
became a livestock dealer, shipping stock over the Michigan
Southern Railroad, and in 1857, he became assistant manager of
that company's shipping department (The Newberry Library,
March 23, 1976).
By 1878, Hoxie had made a fortune in securities, and, like
many other capitalists of his time, had begun to look at Texas
as a place for further investment. Probably as a result of
H.M. Roxie's urging, John R. made his first purchase of Williamson County land on November 19, when he bought 300 acres from
James J. and Mary M. Elliott, heirs of Asa and Elizabeth Hoxey.
Almost a year later, he purchased another 696 acres from W.H.
and Leila Love, also Hoxey heirs; and on September 14, 1880, he
paid $7I500 for almost 900 acres of the Zarza Survey to Ira H.
Evans. 1

Simultaneously, Hoxie was acquiring the property that was
to become his enormous Flag Springs Ranch east of Taylor, with
the first purchase occurring in the early summer of 1878 (The
Wiiiiamson County Sun, May 30, 1878). He formed a loose partnership with W.W. Mumford and F. Allison, registering sets of marks
and brands with both men, and undoubtedly relying on them to
manage his properties north and east of Taylor while he lived in
Chicago.
By 1882, the Flag Springs Ranch was the focus of Hoxie's
attention. The Taylor newspaper reported in February that
Hoxie's establishment "demonstrated to the Texas countymen
how delightful and full of comfort country life may be rr,ade."
His ranch included open, rolling prairie, with several springs
and artificial lakes, which he stocked with fish, "one exclusively with German carp and the other with California salmon.
1

Evans had purchased 340 or those acres from H.M. Hoxie and
,Duncan G. Smith for $1,360 on June 23, 1877.

12

There were also native fishes and black bass" (The Taylor Daily

Press, 80th Anniversary Issue) .. 12

In late 1883, or early 1884, Hoxie made a contract with his
nephew, Mortimer Hoxie, in which Mortimer would resign his job
as livestock agent with the International and Great Northern
Railroad, and take charge of the large San Gabriel and Flag
Springs ranches. The agreement stated that:
The said M.R. Hoxie should, out of
rents and revenues arising from said
lands make certain permanent improvements on said lands, and whereby the
remainder of said rents and revenues,
after paying for said improvements
and all expenses incident to the
management of said property, should,
at the end of said term of management be equally divided between the
said M.R. Hoxie and the said John
R. Hoxie ... (Williamson County Records
a: 151).
By February, Mortimer and C.H. Booth were fencing Hoxie's 7,000plus acres on the San Gabriel (The Taylor Daily Press, 80th
Anniversary Issue), and purchasing pure-bred Hereford stock (The
Texas Stookman, April 15~ 1884). East of Taylor, at Flag Springs
Colonel Mumford acquired more cattle for Hoxie, bringing in
Herefords and shorthorn Durhams (Texas Farm and Ranah, June 15,
1884).
On February 11, 1886, John R. Hoxie and his family arrived
in Taylor from Chicago. The Taylor newspaper reported that his
purpose in coming to Taylor was to spend a vacation at his Flag
Springs residence (Austin Daily Statesman, February 13, 1886),
but subsequent reports indicate that Hoxie was also interested
in using the trip as an opportunity to check on his various

Texas properties, and initiate new business deals. By early
April the news wa~ out that he had formed a syndicate to build
a stockyard in Fort Worth (DaZZas News, May 1, 1886); and on
April 24, he and C.H. Welch left for Midland and the Panhandle
to look after the organization of the Midland National Bank,
and his extensive land holdings in West Texas.
It is likely that Hoxie also came to Taylor in the spring
of 1886 to oversee construction of his new house on the San
Gabriel. Although the date when c6nstruction on the house was
initiated is not known 13 the Taylor newspaper described the
erection of the residence as "just completed" on January 24,
1887 (Austin DaiZy Statesman, January 25, 1887), and the Granger
newspaper a few months earlier had mentioned the mansion as a
new and great attraction in Williamson County:
The Hoxie mansion 'Sunny Side,'
built on the banks~of the San
Gabriel about seven miles southeast of this place, occupies quite
a prominent place in the view in
its direction, from here, and is
visited.by numbers of people daily
from all parts of the country. It
and the 10,000 acres of land surrounding it, make one of the finest
agricultural and stock farms in the
state of Texas (Austin Daily Statesman, September 1, 1886) (Figs. 2,3).
At the time of its completion, the Hoxie mansion was a twostory, frame, Italianate structure, with a stone basement, attic,
and cupola. 1 ~ It was situated on a high bluff overlooking the
13
Construction details for the house are unavailable because the
issues of The WiZZiamson County Sun and Taylor newspapers no

by the Taylor newspaper to the Austin Daily Statesman.

Information on the appearance of the house comes from informants
who lived in or visited it before it burned in 1938, as well as
photographs made of the structure ca. 1900-1910.

San Gabriel River, and according to all reports, was seen easily
from locations ten miles distant. With the exception of tne
McFadin residence up river towards Circleville, Sunnyside was
the most impressive domestic structure between Hoxie Community
and Granger.
A fairly accurate picture of the house can be obtained from
information volunteered by various families who lived in it
after 1900. The basement, for example, was one large room with
a dirt floor and plastered stone walls. Entrance was by way of
stairs which led from an enclosed closet in the kitchen on the
first floor. Furnishings consisted of butcher blocks, two large
refrigerators, meat hooks, and a large stove which was used for
cooking and preserving fruits and vegetables (Bennight, May 3,
1976; Kotrla, October 26, 1969; Malek, May 7, 1976; Martin, May
11, 1976).
As time passed, the first floor of the Hoxie mansion became
the area that was used most often by various residents. A onestory covered gallery extended across the front, or south side,
of the structure, as well as over the east and west sides.
Stairs led up to a front porch, through double doors, and into
a wide hall which ran the length of the house, north/south, and
ended in a kitchen which was oriented east/west. Sliding doors
led off of the main hall into four rooms, two being on the east
and two on the west. One of the rooms served as a parlor,
another as a phone room, and a third as a dining room; the fourth
room was a large, all-purpose space which eventually was used as
a bedroom by the families that lived in the house in the 1920's
(Barton and Prewitt, April 26, 1976; Bennight and Malek).
Heat was provided by a fireplace in the phone room and a
large stove in the dining room. All residents of Sunnyside
remember, however, that the name could not have been more inappropriate, as the thin, plastered wooden walls and highceilinged rooms proved impossible to heat. As one resident
expressed it, living in the Hoxie House in 1930 "was no romance."
[Its] exceedingly high ceilings
enormous size of the rooms
presented problems of cleaning and
heating. Each succeeding winter
seemed abnormally long and bitterly

cold and al tho-' [sic] the fireplaces
were man[m]oth, the lugging in of
the logs up the near six £oot high
porch was a job for two strong ~en
(Kotrla).
The second floor of the house was composed of another wide
hall with bedrooms leading off of it. At the top of the stairs
that led from the first to the secon~ floor, was a guestroom
that contained two double beds, two marble-topped dressers, and
three marble-topped tables. Another bedroom, used by a member
of the Allison family, was furnished with a bed, marble-topped
dresser, and matching table. The only bathroom in the house
also was located on the second floor, and included a commode
and bathtub (Kotrla, Malek and Martin) . 15
Above the second floor was an unfinished attic, and above
it, a cupola that could be reached by way of a ladder. Entrance
to the attic was through a narrow service stairway, placed
against the east wall, and leading from the attic to the basement (Bennight, Kotrla, and Malek).
Furnishings in the house were massive, and generally excellent in quality. At one time, pieces included beds, washstands,
a writing desk, sideboard, sofas, dressers, settees, various
chairs, a large dining-room table, and a hatrack with a mirror
and marble top that stood in the first-floor hall. Some of the
furniture, such as the piece now in the possession of Ernest
Malek of Taylor, was similar to that manufactured by C.H. Booth
of Wheeling, West Virginia 16 (Richter, May 7, 1976); while other
pieces, such as the dresser owned by another Taylor resident,
more nearly resemble those described by Mrs. Francis Sefcik,
who noted that when John R. Hoxie died, his furniture was shipped
from Chicago to Circleville. Mrs. Sefcik, who was thirteen
at the time the event occurred in 1896, described the pieces as
being walnut, with marble tops (Sefcik,_November 9, 1969).
15

Water was supplied by a cistern located just outside the
kitchen, and a windmill that was situated to the east of the
house. Light was provided by carbide lamps (Malek).

16

Booth, with John R. Hoxie, was one of the organizers of
the First National Bank, Taylor (Richter).

19

If Hoxie House was architecturally impressive, the buildings that surrounded it were equally notable for their size
and number. A white, one-story frame house with a front porch
on the south lay directly to the north of the main house. East
of this smaller structure was a long, narrow building that was
used as a commissary or store by people who lived on the Hoxie
Ranch. To the north, between Sunnyside and the San Gabriel, was
a stable or horse stall, built into the side of the hill, and
capable of holding up to a dozen ho_rses. A barn was located
directly above the stable (Kreiger, n.d.; Bennight, Kotrla, and
Martin) . 17
In the late 1880's, the Hoxie San Gabriel Ranch had reached
its peak of development and included the mansion, numerous outbuildings, and over 8,000 acres of land. Stock included horses,
sheep, hogs; and thoroughbred Herefords, shorthorn Durhams,
4,000 acres, included cotton, corn and alfalfa. As the Taylor
newspaper reported on January 24, 1887, shortly after Hoxie
House was completed, "this is decidedly the best improved and
best stocked farm in Williamson County" (Austin Daily Statesman,
January 25, 1887).
Despite the charms of his new house, John R. Hoxie's stay
there was very brief. His wife and children professed never to
have cared for the building and its surround~ngs; and by 1887
Hoxie was involved in new business dealings in Fort Worth, leaving his nephew, Mortimer Hoxie, to manage his Williamson County
properties. 18 A foreman, R.O. Lankford, lived in Sunnyside.

Those structures were, in

18
Mortimer Hoxie became well-known for his abilities with
cattle breeding. At the Dallas State Fair, May 4-6, 1887,
the Hoxie ranches, managed by Mortimer, won prizes for
best Holstein cow and bull, best Hereford shorthorn cow.
Other
prizes included a blue ribbon for all-purpose stallions, and
a second place for a thorough-bred Hereford bull between the
ages of two and three (The Williamson County Sun, May 12,
1887).

20

On July 7, 1887, The Williamson County Sun noted that "John
R. Hoxie has purchased property in fort [sic] Worth to the amount
of $20,000." Within a short time, he had declared his house
there as his homestead, and had become as involved in Fort
Worth's economic life as he once had been in that of Taylor,
being named director of the First National Bank in 1890 (Dallas
Morning News, January 18, 1890).
Later in the same year, he began construction of Fort
Worth's first packing plant (Dall~s Morning News, November 9,
1890; November 27, 1890; April 12, 1891), a contribution to the
city, which, in addition to his banking activities, led the Fort
Worth Daily Gazette to praise him as an individual who had "done
much to make Fort Worth a financial center" (November 1, 1890).
When John R. Hoxie died on November 21, 1896, he left a
will that enumerated his vast wealth and land holding throughout
Texas. In addition, the document leaves us with a means for
assessing the relative position his San Gabriel ranch held in
relation to his entire estate. Out of properties in Texas
totalling $450,435, Sunnyside and the Ranch were evaluated at
$252,000. Other properties listed in the inventory included the
4,560-acre Flag Springs Ranch, appraised at $124,000; two lots
in Taylor ($3,000); twenty sections in Andrews County ($12,800);
fifty-two sections in Martin County ($33,280); seven sections in
Andrews ~nd Martin counties ($4,480); 96.4 acres in Tarrant
County ($1,320); eight lots and six acres in Forth Worth "composing the place formerly occupied by the said John R. Hoxie, while
living in Texas, as a homestead" ($15,000); lots and water
privileges in Rockport ($450); one-fifth interest in 530 acres
of Young County land ($1,060); one lot in Archer, Texas ($10);
and a lease-hold interest in 1,777 acres in Martin and Andrews
counties ($35) (Williamson County Records c: 143-152).
Hoxie's death foreshadowed the demise of the ranch and
of Sunnyside, for although Mortimer continued to manage the
property according the 1884 agreement, his tenure after 1896
appears to have been brief. By 1907, he and his wife, Anna,
and son, Thomas M., had moved to Electra, Texas, where Thomas
found employment in W.T. Waggoner's bank (Paddock 1922: 393).
He died in somewhat mysterious anonymity in El Paso on February
8, 1921, and was followed by his wife on December 15, 1930
(Texas n.d.: 12236; El Paso Times, December 1930).

21

1910-1976: Dissolution of the Ranch

With or without Mortimer's help, Mary Hoxie continued to
administer her husband's large estate until 1910, when the
distance between Taylor and.her Chicago home may have become
overwhelming. In that year, on March 28f she agreed to sell
the property to a partnership comprised of Francis A. Allison
and Fred Welch of Taylor, and her son, Gilbert H. Hoxie of
Chicago. The three became owners of the ranch for a consideration of $361,320.
The Granger News reported the sale of the Hoxie Ranch on
January 27, 1910, as well as the intentions of the new owners:
The last of the big ranches of
Williamson County to go 'under
the hammer' that is to say, to
be subdivided into tracts for
small farms, will be the John
R. Hoxie San Gabriel River property, which comprises between
seven and eight thousand acres.
Improvements to the ranch at the time of its sale were listed
as being the Hoxie mansion and about forty-five tenant houses .
.Approximately 3,500 acres of the tract were under cultivation;
no stock was listed in the transaction. 19
Some years before their purchase of the San Gabriel Ranch,
Allison and Welch had bought Hoxie's Flag Springs Ranch and
subdivided it (Granger News, January 27, 1910). By late 1910
it was clear that they intended to deal with the San Gabriel
property in the same manner. They filed a subdivision plat in
the Williamson County Courthouse on December 3, 1910, and proceeded to sell off parcels of land that ranged in size from
approximately 60 to 200 acres (Fig. 4).

HOXIE SAN GABRIEL RANCH - - 1910 SUBDIVISION PLAT
COURTESY DR. CHARLES ALLISON

23

retained by Mrs. P.A. Allison and Mrs. S.G. Gernert (a member
of the Welch family), and managed by Charles F. Allison; the
land was rented out to a series of tenant farmers who also
occupied the house. From approximately 1918 to 1923, the John
Bennights lived ther·e; they were followed by the Malek family.
Residents at the time the house burned were the Ed Sefcak family,
who moved in about 1929 or 1930, and rented approximately 500
acres for cultivation.
The burning of Sunnyside on Mar~h 31, 1938, attracted almost
as much attention from neighboring communities as the lives of
its wealthy occupants had fifty years before. But with the
destruction of the structure, all evidence of the house and its
past disappeared. The Hoxies were gone, and now one more
reminder of their presence in Williamson County also had
vanished. The further subdivision of the property among members
of the Allison family, the filling in of the cavernous basement
in 1952, and the acqisition of the property by the United States
Army Corps of Engineers in 1973 finally eraced all obvious traces
of a site that once had been a Williamson County landmark.
Assessment and Recommendations
Just how important were the Hoxies and their San Gabriel
Ranch?
First, Hoxie House itself, at the time of its construction,
was neither the oldest nor the most architecturally significant
building in Williamson County, the Captain Merrell House outside
Round Rock and the Mcfadin home only a short distance a.way being
old structures by the time Sunnyside was built. Second, the
cost of construction, $15,000 to $20,000, while of more value
in 1886 than in 1976, was not an unusual amount for a wealthy
family to spent on a home .. 2 0 Third, the length of time the
Hoxies resided in the house was negligible, with the Flag Springs
residence being an earlier and more often used home for the
family. Finally, and irrefutably, the house is no longer extant,
and valid claims to architectural significance were considerably
lessened with its burning.
20
The Snyder house in Georgetown, built about the same time as
the Hoxie San Gabriel home, cost approximately the same amount.

24

On the other hand, if the house was .merely typically
Victorian in ·its.excesses of size, complexity, and at times,
lack of comforts, the families who owned it and developed the
ranch were anything but ordinary. ·In every way--personal ability,
wealth, as well as social and business acumen--the Hoxie family
members were out of the ordinary. They were, like the house
they built, a little larger than life. Asa Hoxey, for example,
not only participated in many of the military events leading up
to the formation of the.Republic of Texas, but filled leadership positions after Texas gained statehood. John R. Hoxie,
hailed as one of the significant forces in the development of
Fort Worth, was at one time the wealthiest individual in
Williamson County, and was representative of the large numbers
of eastern and midwestern capitalists who made the economic
development of Texas possible in the 1870's and 1880's.
Herbert M. Hoxie, though connected only with the ranch property
itself, and then briefly, was hailed at his death as virtual
head of the Gould system of railroads in the Southwest, and
among the foremost railway managers in the United States
(Harper's Weekly, December 4, 1886:. 784). Simultaneously, as
founder of the Taylor townsite, he was an important local figure.
What is significant about the Hoxie San Gabriel Ranch, then,
is not so much Sunnyside itself, which disappeared from the scene
almost forty years ago, but the lives of the people who built
it and developed the ranch. For this reason, it is important
that the merits of the Hoxie family members as significant
local, state, and national figures be recognized, and the
relative value of the cultural site to the history of the family
be kept in mind in any development of the property.
