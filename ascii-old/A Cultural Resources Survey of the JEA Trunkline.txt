Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct a complete field survey of the 24.4mile JEA Trunkline to be installed by Mockingbird Midstream Gas Services, L.L.C.
(Mockingbird) in northwestern La Salle County, Texas. The project was entirely privately funded,
and the properties across which the pipeline will cross are privately owned; therefore, no Texas
Antiquities Permit was required.
A 100-percent pedestrian survey with shovel testing along the 24.4-mile right-of-way was
conducted by four archaeologists during the period February 10-12, 2011 resulting in the
discovery of three prehistoric lithic scatters and two isolated prehistoric artifacts. All were
assessed as possessing little potential to contribute to the prehistory of Texas and were considered
to be non-significant. No artifacts were collected during this project.
Therefore, Tierras Antiguas recommended that the development of the trunkline be allowed to
proceed as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that if any additional,
undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development, such finds should be
examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly three individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are Mr. David Black
and Ms. Judy Vader, Project Managers at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, and Mr.
Ronnie Glenewinkel, Environmental Coordinator at Mockingbird Midstream. All three were
extremely amiable and helpful throughout the project, and their overall knowledge of the project
contributed significantly to our understanding of the project’s scope of work.
In addition, I express my sincere gratitude to Tierras Antiguas staff archaeologists Belisario Silva,
Josh Hamilton, and Tom Hanson, who worked hard, long hours, and expressed an attitude and
work ethic that ensured this survey was conducted in a thorough and professional manner.

Introduction
Flatrock Engineering and
Environmental, Ltd., requested a field
cultural resources survey of the 24.4mile JEA Trunkline in northwestern La
Salle counties to be installed by
Mockingbird Midstream, and
sometimes hereinafter referred to as the
Project Area (PA) (Figures 1 and 2).
Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations (TAAI) conducted a 100percent pedestrian survey with intensive
shovel testing along the right-of-way
during the period February 10-12, 2011.

Modern Environmental
Setting
Climate and Vegetation
La Salle County is located in southcentral Texas near its southern border
with Mexico (see Figure 1). Its current
political boundary encompasses 1,517
square miles. The generally flat to
rolling terrain ranges in elevation from
about 600-800 feet above mean sea
level. Clayey and loamy soils support the
growth of small predominately mesquite
trees, and thorny scrub brush with
assorted cacti and grassy understory.

Figure 1. Location of La Salle county and the JEA
Trunkline in Texas.

Figure 2. Project Area on large topographic map.

With its semi-arid environment, the county is generally frost-free from mid-February through
early December, allowing for about 288 growing season days. The average annual rainfall is about
22 inches, with most rainfall occurring in May and September. These peaks are the result of
thunderstorms bearing moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to the east, and the Pacific Ocean much
farther to the west. La Salle county is part of what is known as the ‘Winter Garden Region’ for
the vegetables grown there (Leffler 1996; Ochoa 1996; Gabriel et al. 1985).
However, rainfall amounts vary significantly from year to year, and the high evapotranspiration
effects in the area effectively offset any beneficial surplus of annual rainfall. This is another
1

reason irrigation systems are so
necessary, and commonly found in use
today throughout the area. Summers are
indeed hot and dry, with temperatures
consistently hovering above 1000F,
although humidity is generally low
compared to environments closer to the
Gulf Coast. Overall, the climate can be
classified as subtropical steppe.
Hydrology
The Nueces River and the Rio Grande
are the major southeasterly trending
rivers draining the South Texas region.
A subtle divide through the northeastern
portion of the county causes numerous
intermittent creeks to flow north into
the Nueces River, and numerous others
of the same type to drain southward into
the Rio Grande. Many drainages
intermittently flow into both rivers
during infrequent seasonal periods of
abundant rainfall. Although there are
many springs, very few are active due
primarily to the dip of the substrate
shales which carry these subterranean
seeps to the south and east. As a result,
some of these active seeps/springs can
be found on the Mexican side of the
national border. Ancient springs that
may have existed in the area at one time
have likely succumbed to overgrazing
and irrigation pumping during modern
times (Brune 1981). During our
investigation of the project area in
February 2011, we observed no flowing
water or niche pools.

Flora and Fauna
The project area lies within the South
Texas Plain/Brush Country vegetation
area as defined by Gould (1975), and the
regional flora of South Texas has been Figure 4. Blair’s (1950) biotic provinces of Texas.
classified as being part of the
2

Tamaulipan biotic province extending out from northeast Mexico (Figures 3 and 4). This is the
only part of Texas where some vegetation exhibits growth throughout the year (Blair 1950; Map
2011a). Thorny brush is the dominant vegetation today, but this is a relatively recent occurrence,
with a mix of woody and grassland species providing a savanna environment during prehistoric
times (Archer 1995; Black 1989; Hester 1980; Inglis 1964). The original vegetation was an open
grassland mixed with brushy chaparral. Oaks, pecan, and ash were common along perennial
streams. Due in part to overgrazing and the exclusion of fire, the invasion of woody species has
changed the vegetation into “Texas brush country” dominated by mesquite, acacia, spiny
hackberry, brazil, whitebrush, lotebrush, and others (Diamond et al. 1987:203-221). On sandy
soils, the brush includes mesquite with mixed grasses. In contrast, clay soils support mesquite
(Proposis juliflora), various species of Acacia, and mimosa, granjeno or desert hackberry (Celtis
pallida), lignum vitae (Porliera angustifolia), cenizo (Leucophyllum texanum), white brush
(Aloysia texana), prickly pear (Opuntia lindheeimeri), tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis), and species
of Condalia and Castela (Blair 1950).
The South Texas Plains/Brush Country exhibits some of the greatest mammalian species diversity
in the state. Sixty-one species of mammals, 36 snakes, 19 lizards, and several species of turtles,
salamanders, and frogs are present in the region (Blair 1950). Approximately 50 species of fish
have been identified in the lower Rio Grande (Lee et al. 1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of Texas is as varied as the landscape, and the South Texas Paleoclimatic
record contains significant gaps primarily due to the scarcity of deep, finely stratified, and welldated deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995:51). To date, the best record of paleoenvironmental
reconstruction in South Texas has been accomplished by Robinson (1982) from analysis of
phytoliths from three archaeological sites in Live Oak County. Overall, the data there along with
data from other sites in Texas suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or late-glacial period,
marked a transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew warmer and drier,
and more seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years ago.
Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago was
much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area
that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The greater changes have been induced by
human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along the rivers and streams for
construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps, springs, and streams in the area,
they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter intervals than exist at the present
time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Chronology
The JEA Trunkline project lies within the South Texas Archaeological region as defined by
Hester (1980, 1995, 2004; Figure 5). Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is
problematic, due to the compressed nature of the archaeological record and the scarcity of
stratified sites excavated within the region (e.g. Hall et al. 1986). Hester (1995:433) acknowledges
the paucity of information that exists for south Texas and as such offers only a “general
framework” for prehistoric periods particular to the region (Figure 5). All dates are given as
approximate years before present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.
Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1999). The
Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of Clovistype points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the people who made them. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
ochre, and shaft straighteners. During the late Paleoindian interval, the first stemmed lanceolate
points, such as Angostura, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans,
such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons, although they undoubtedly
hunted the large animals as well (Collins 1995:381). Known Clovis sites include killsites,
quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly common in south Texas; however, no camp
sites or killsites have been found south of a large workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar
County (Hester 1995:434–435). Most Paleoindian finds in south Texas have consisted of surface
lithic scatters on upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters
were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes
in the subsistence base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural
period known as the Archaic.

Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
4

of megafauna and the changing
climate at the beginning of the
Holocene stimulated a
behavioral change by the
Prehistoric inhabitants of south
Texas (McKinney 1981). While
the basic hunter-gatherer
adaptation probably remained
intact, an economic shift away
from big game hunting was
necessary. In general, more
intensive exploitation of local
and smaller resources such as
deer, fish, and plant bulbs is
indicated by greater densities of
ground-stone artifacts, firecracked rock cooking features,
and more specialized tools. Weir
(1976) speculates that Early
Archaic groups were small and
highly mobile, an inference
based on the fact that Early
Archaic sites are thinly
distributed and that diagnostic
projectile point types are seen
across a wide area, including
most of Texas and northern
Mexico. Story (1985) believes
that population densities were
low during the Early Archaic,
and that groups consisted of
related individuals in small
bands with “few constraints on
their mobility” (Story 1985:39).
Their economy was based on the
utilization of a wide range of
resources, especially such yearround resources as prickly pear
and lechugilla, as well as
rodents, rabbits, and deer.

chronology.

Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population,
based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). On the
South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear
continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. Weir (1976)
believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at
least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of
gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned
rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). The common
presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer processing took
place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a movement toward less
mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas
Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between ca. 2550 and 2750
B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P, Some
researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while
others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30). Subsistence
is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence
base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries indicates that Late
Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial.
Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make
pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “pre-ceramic” until 1,000 years
later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic
points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner and Hester (1993) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period during
the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is represented by
diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap the Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this marked a transition
period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and bison, and a
reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw 1985; Peter
1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not disappear and sites
were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.

6

Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted.
Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a nonstandard
manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the ones that best
suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core reduction and the
manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology is a continent-wide
phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
7

characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally
sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live
near each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans were
rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then,
is generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

La Salle County Prehistory and History
Indian artifacts found in La Salle County indicate that the area has been occupied for about 11,000
years. Plentiful food sources such as wild game, fruits, seeds, and roots made the land hospitable.
Early technology included tools from wood and stone, woven basketry, sewed rabbitskin robes,
and a very effective weapon was the atlatl, a throwing stick that greatly increased the deadliness
of their spears (Leffler 1996). Perhaps as early as 1,300 years ago, they learned to make pottery
and to hunt with bows and arrows. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the
Coahuiltecan Indians native to La Salle County were squeezed out by other Indian who were
migrating into the area and by the Spanish, who were moving up from the south. Many of the
8

Coahuiltecans were taken to San Juan Bautista in Coahuila. Apaches and Comanches moved in
to take their place (Leffler 1996).
The earliest historic accounts of Native Americans in south Texas and perhaps the La Salle
County area, are those of Cabeza de Vaca. In the 1500s, Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
traversed parts of southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling
among the hunter-gatherers of Texas and northern Mexico (e.g., Covey 1961). His account of his
experiences in 1533–34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether
themselves to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter, and summer,
occasionally sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many
groups would live near each other in the semiarid environs of south Texas to harvest prickly pear
pads and other succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–37).
By the 1540s and 1550s, Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico with
thousands of cattle, and using Native Americans as slave labor. This encroachment by the Spanish
forced Native American groups from northern Mexico to flee into south Texas. Beginning in the
late 1600s, however, Spaniards passed through the area on the Old San Antonio Road, a camino
real, to and from other Spanish settlements in Texas. In the 1700s and 1800s, there are
documented accounts of Spanish entradas passing through the area, but none have been noted to
establish any sort of permanent bases in present-day La Salle County (Chipman 1992)
After the Mexican War of Independence the Mexican government used land grants to encourage
its citizens to settle in Texas. Perhaps as many as seven grants were made between 1832 and 1834
that included territory now in La Salle County. None of the recipients seem to have made use of
the land, however. By 1836, when Texas became independent from Mexico, the area remained
populated almost solely by Indians (Leffler 1996).
Between the Texas Revolution and the Mexican War (1836–46), most of La Salle County lay in
the disputed area between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River, and it became a haven for
desperate characters until about 1865. New settlers who lived in jacals or dugouts were frequently
being harrassed by hostile Indians and outlaws. Due in part to being pursued by the Texas
Rangers, and being decimated by disease, the Indians were forced to leave La Salle County by
1877. By 1880, cattle ranching was firmly established, and although sheep ranching was also an
important part of the economy at the time, by 1900 extended droughts and an increase in predators
combined to make sheep ranching a tough and dwindling business (Leffler 1996).
As with rest of the nation, during the Great Depression many of the county’s farmers were forced
to cut back their once-lucrative vegetable production, and they fell back on raising poultry, hogs,
and dairy cattle (Leffler 1996). The discovery of large oil and gas fields in the county in the 1950s
certainly bolstered La Salle County’s economy, and although large ranches lay claim to most of
the land in the county, the production of oil and gas are very much a progressively increasing part
of the county’s development (Leffler 1996).

Site Types That Could be Expected Along the JEA Trunkline
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in La Salle County are prehistoric open campsites
ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period (see Figure 5). Some of
these represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have
camped for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large
groups of people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning
to these same campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found
at these large campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks
representing multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that
results from making them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal
remains from terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and
snail shells. Open campsites occur in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine
environment that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands
away from flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, and cacti offered a
different food source that could be exploited such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly
pear pads and tunas, and agave hearts. In addition, at various times, bison were known to graze
on the northern South Texas Plains, and were highly sought after for use as food, hides, and bone
tools (Dilley 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that could be expected along
the JEA Trunkline. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken tools that
were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The
general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open
campsites suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time
( However, small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make
them more knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural
outcroppings or surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles.
Examples of chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two
flakes removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the
10

quality of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they
‘tested’ the cobble to judge whether it was usable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior,
then the cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites
are of poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried
away from these sites, what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and
the thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic
scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles
flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further
reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks
are usually not found on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably to areas of
south Texas where raw material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry blanks are
of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found
on any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops
that were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried
today, and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and the dynamics
of landscape evolution through time. Most lithic scatters in La Salle County have been
documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also can range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but
differ from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at
times they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were
not yet freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types of
sites are rare in south Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally do not present
themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to pick up gravels
from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped stone remains
likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as well as
parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected. Although
a handful of prehistoric quarries or procurement sites have been recorded in south Texas, they are
rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
There are no documented burned rock middens in La Salle County. Burned rock middens result
from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much like modern-day roasting
pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the larger rocks that serve as
heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective as a thermal source,
they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable, another is dug near
by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched out’ fire-cracked
rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a full discussion of the formation
of burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas, see Leach and Bousman 2001;
Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).

11

Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in south
Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites in both
upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams, but the largest prehistoric cemetery
found in proximity to the JEA Trunkline is 41LK28, in Live Oak County.

Historic Sites
As discussed above in the Cultural Chronology portion of this report, although Spanish ranchers
had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th century, and Spanish entradas
began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no record of any sort of permanent
structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992). The area was generally not considered
safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil War in 1865, and white settlers then began
establishing smaller ranches and farmlands (Leffler 2011).
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of
south Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types
most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation
remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial
or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects. In general, the area has been historically used predominantly as ranchland
pasture, with no development other than associated ranching activities such as windmills, stock
tanks, corrals, and sparsely scattered outbuildings.

Results of A Cultural Resources Background Review
The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the immediate
area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area
3) A search of various websites that offer old maps of the PA
4) A literature review of both published and unpublished reports and manuscripts that describe
the types of archaeological sites that have been documented, and thus provide insight as to the
types of sites that may be expected either in the PA, or immediately adjacent to it

12

5) A review of a local soils map in order to evaluate the potential for intact and buried cultural
materials either within or immediately adjacent to the PA.

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
La Salle County Archaeological Sites
There are only 99 archaeological sites recorded within La Salle County, ranging in age from the
Paleoindian through the Historic periods. Of the 99 sites, 54 are prehistoric open campsites, and
45 are prehistoric lithic scatters. Historic components on these same prehistoric sites include
historic windmills and areas with scattered glass and ceramic sherds, or in some cases there are
large trash dumps. One unique historic site is Fort Ewell (41LS19), an adobe structure located on
the old Laredo to San Antonio Road, and that served the U.S. Army from 1852-1854. The only
State Archaeological Landmark (SAL) recorded in La Salle County is the County Courthouse in
Cotulla.

Previous Surveys and Known Archaeological Sites within One Mile of the JEA Trunkline
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archaeological sites indicates that
there are no known archaeological sites within one mile, and the only documented cultural
resources survey within one mile was conducted by the Federal Highway Administration in
February 2000 along Ranch Road 469. However, as shown in Figures 6-9, seven other surveys
have either been conducted. A survey of the Dilley to Gardendale Oil Pipeline was conducted by
Tierras Antiguas in February 2011, resulting in the discovery of three prehistoric lithic scatters,
but none within one mile of the JEA Trunkline (Nickels 2011a).
The Light Trunkline right-of-way was subjected to a cultural resources background review in both
March and June 2011. Segments of both the JEA Trunkline and the Brownlow Pipeline follow
a segment of the Light Trunkline. No archaeological sites were discovered on either the Light or
the Brownlow within one mile of the JEA Trunkline (Nickels 2011b,c).
Tierras Antiguas conducted cultural resources surveys of the Slaughter Ranch Lateral and the
Shining Star Lateral in June 2011, also resulting in the discovery of no archaeological sites
(Nickels 2011d,e). In April 2011, Tierras Antiguas conducted a field survey of the Dietz Lateral,
again resulting in the discovery of no archaeological sites (Nickels 2011f).

Soils Maps
The alignment of JEA Trunkline proposed to cross multiple soil types that offer varying depths,
sedimentation and deposition rates, and some are in close proximity to streams. As such, they
likewise imply the potential for the preservation of intact cultural resources to exist. Figures 10-13
show the soils that are intersected by the pipeline, as well as surrounding soil types (Gabriel et
al. 1994; Web Soil Survey 2010). Table 1 then presents a brief description of each type, and their
potential to contain deeply buried and intact cultural deposits.
In sum, the JEA Trunkline right-of-way was to pass through upland areas with soils and sediments
that are generally shallow, and if prehistoric archaeological sites did exist, the soils as mapped
suggested that any archaeological deposits were likely in a palimpsest (collapsed) or eroded state,
and thus offered little in the way of scientific significance. However, the right-of-way was also
to cross potential terrace deposits that have a very high probability of containing deeply buried
and intact archaeological deposits that can be potentially significant to our understanding of Texas
prehistory. In sum, in accordance with guidelines set forth by the Texas Historical Commission,
and the Council of Texas Archeologists, Tierras Antiguas recommended a full pedestrian survey,
with shovel testing to be conducted every 100 meters along the entire length of the proposed rightof-way.

Field Survey Goals and Methodology
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South
Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Four archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the 24.4-mile right-of-way
(ROW), meandering back and forth across the 100-foot wide corridor. Surface visibility ranged
from 80 to 100 percent, and all cutbanks, and rodent and mammal backdirt piles were thoroughly
examined. The northwestern portion of the Trunkline was to follow a recently installed pipeline
for approximately five miles; that portion was subjected to a full pedestrian survey, but no shovel
testing. Otherwise, a full pedestrian survey was conducted of the remaining approximately 19.4
miles. A total of 294 shovel tests were dug along that portion of the right-of-way (Figures 14-21).
Shovel tests were dug in 20-cm levels, and all sediments were screened through 1/4-inch wire
mesh. All shovel test locations were documented with a hand-held GPS. In accordance with a
general “no collection” policy, cultural materials of a redundant nature, both prehistoric and
historic, observed either on the surface or within shovel tests were not to be collected. Instead, they
were to be fully documented via sketches, field photographs, and copious notes, and their locations

19

recorded with a hand-held GPS. Following that, they were to be returned to the surface if surface
finds, or to the top 10 cm of the shovel tests.
Exceptions were diagnostic artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be considered as
significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian
transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and
that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist.
Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences within the ROW were to be
documented as archaeological sites. In addition, any potentially historic buildings 45 years or older
that were located adjacent to the ROW were to be documented with photographs and included in
the report of investigations.
Sites were to be mapped using a pace-and-compass method, as well as a GPS. Field notes were to
be made about each site and sketch maps were to be drawn. Representative artifacts on each site
were to be gathered and photographed.

Results of the Field Investigations

Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
During the survey it became readily
apparent that approximately 80 percent
of the project’s surface area was either
disturbed or deflated by natural
processes. Sparse to dense vegetation
throughout much of the 24.4 miles
consisted of small mesquite trees,
shrubs, mesquite brush, and native
grasses (Figure 22).

Archaeological Sites Discovered
Three archaeological sites were found
along the 24.4-mile right-of-way

three are prehistoric lithic scatters consisting of chipped stone tools and debitage; no fire-cracked
rocks were observed on any of the three sites. All three have been heavily disturbed and lay on
eroded and deflated soils.

41LS158
Description
41LS158 (Figures 23 and 24) is a
prehistoric lithic scatter of an
unknown age. It is situated on the
apex of an upland northwestsoutheast trending ridge between
two intermittent drainages. The
area has apparently been cleared
for farming at one time.
Vegetation on the site now

mesquite trees and brush, along
with sparse grasses. Elevation at
the site ranges from 530-535 feet
above mean sea level (amsl).

50 to 100 percent. Soils on the
site consist of Chacon clay loam
(CDB), deep loamy soils
commonly found on broad
uplands in La Salle County
(Gabriel et al. 1994).
Levels of Effort and Results
The surface distribution of
artifacts covers an area roughly
900 square meters. Artifacts
observed on the surface included
sparsely scattered primary and
secondary chert flakes, amidst a
widely dispersed scatter of finegrained chert gravels (some with
coarse-grained inclusions) spread Figure 24. 41LS158 site photo; facing northwest.
across the slope. Notably, the flakes were all core reduction flakes, exhibiting no evidence of final
stage reduction. The results of shovel testing revealed shallow loam over extremely compacted

25

hardpan ranging in depth from 10 to 40 centimeters below the surface (cmbs). The only evidence
of buried chipped stone was an exterior flake recovered from the upper 20 cm of Shovel Test 5.
Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
41LS158 appears to be a prehistoric upland lithic scatter of an unknown age. It is situated on a
prominent ridge and sideslope that offer a strategic view of the valleys of two intermittent
drainages. Technologically, the chipped stone pieces remaining suggest the exposed gravels were
reduced to an initial stage, with middle and stage reduction occurring elsewhere. No temporal
diagnostics were observed that could suggest a period of exploitation. The shallow soils are eroded
and deflated. As such, its research value is considered minimal, and Tierras Antiguas assesses the
site as non-significant.

41LS159
Description
41LS159 (Figures 25 and 26) is a
prehistoric lithic scatter of an
unknown age. It is situated on a
gentle northwest facing sideslope.
Approximately 15 meters have

unknown age. It is situated on a
gentle easterly slope, west of an
upland tributary. Typical upland
vegetation consists of scattered

Isolated Finds Discovered
In addition to the three archaeological sites discussed above, two isolated finds consisting of
prehistoric pieces of chipped stone were found on heavily eroded surfaces (see Figures 15 and 17).
Each is described below; UTM coordinates are given in NAD 83.

28

Isolated Find 1 (N3147424 E486680)
Isolated Find 1 consists of two secondary,
bifacial manufacturing flakes, with
approximately 10 percent cortex
remaining. Both were unbroken, and
made from unheated tan, fine-grained
chert. The first measured 3 cm in
maximum length, and the second
measured 1.9 cm. Both were found on
heavily eroded, upland surfaces (Figure
30).

grey, non heat-treated, fine-grained chert.
It measures 3.1 cm at its maximum length, and it was found on a heavily eroded red claypan
surface.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A 100-percent pedestrian survey with shovel testing along the JEA Trunkline right-of-way was
conducted by four archaeologists during the period 10-12 February 2011. As a result, three
archaeological sites and two prehistoric isolated finds were documented. The two prehistoric
archaeological sites (41LS158, 41LS159, and 41LS160) are assessed as non-significant in their
current conditions. The two isolated finds serve to plot the prehistoric use of the landscape, but
they in and of themselves are also considered to be non-significant.
As such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the JEA Trunkline be allowed to be constructed as
currently aligned and designed. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommends that if any
additional, undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development, such finds
should be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant.
