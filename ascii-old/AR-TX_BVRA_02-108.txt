ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted an archaeological survey
and evaluation of approximately one mile (1.8 acres) of a proposed water line on private
property in northern Robertson County, Texas. This work was carried out in October
2002 under the supervision of William E. Moore (Principal Investigator). The sponsor
for this project was the Robertson County Water Supply Corporation (WSC) of Franklin,
Texas. The area examined consisted of two segments: one previously surveyed by
archaeologists and a second that had not been previously examined. In the area that
had not been surveyed no archaeological sites were found. A prehistoric site
(41RT426) had been recorded in the previously surveyed area. No evidence of this site
was found to be within the project area; therefore, no additional work is warranted.
Copies of the report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology
Division; Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin;
the Robertson County WSC; and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
Robertson County WSC plans to improve the domestic water supply to rural
Robertson County, Texas by installing new water line at various locations throughout
the northern portion of the county (Figure 1). The construction for this project is being
funded through a federal grant provided by the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA), Rural Development Office. Therefore, this investigation comes under the
purview of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended,
and its implementing regulations (36 CFR Part 800). The survey was conducted on
October 31, 2002.
Although the entire project area consists of 56 miles of proposed water line, 1
new well, 1 well upgrade, and 3 generators, only a one mile segment (1.8 acres) was
considered likely for the occurrence of significant archaeological sites. This area
consists of the uplands on both sides of Steele Creek. This decision was made by
Texas Historical Commission reviewer William A. Martin and communicated in a letter to
KSA Engineers, Inc. dated September 18, 2002. The project area is depicted on the
topographic quadrangle Oletha dated 1966 (photorevised 1982) (Figure 2).
The proposed construction in the current project area involves installation of a 4
inch water line in an undisturbed area on private property. The construction right-of-way
(ROW) is 15 feet and will be placed on the south side of County Road 477. In the
approximate center of this ROW, the pipe will be placed in a 16 inch wide trench to a
maximum depth of 36 inches.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
General
Robertson County has been the focus of numerous investigations by professional
archaeologists. Major projects in the county include the Upper Navasota Reservoir
(now Lake Limestone) (Prewitt 1974; Prewitt and Dibble 1974), Jewett Mine (Espey,
Huston & Associates, Inc. 1980; Voellinger and Freeman 1980; Freeman and Voellinger
1982; Fields 1988), Millican Reservoir (Kotter 1982), the Calvert Mine (Good, et al.
1980, Davis, et al. 1987, Bement and Utley 1992, Robinson and Turpin 1993), and the
Texas Utilities Mining Company, Twin Oaks project (Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc.
1987).
Lake Limestone was examined by the Texas Archeological Survey in 1974 under
contract with the Brazos River Authority. Only areas of high site probability such as
floodplains and valley margins along the Navasota River and its major tributaries were
surveyed. Fifty-two prehistoric sites were recorded within the reservoir area. Of this
number, 37 were found to be situated on the crests or slopes of eroded valley margins.
At Lake Limestone, Prewitt and Grombacher (1974:7) found a scarcity of sites
along the major tributaries. They attribute this to the possibility that desirable or needed
resources were more readily available along the mainstem valley than along the
tributaries.
Following the Lake Limestone project, work at Jewett Mine commenced in 1980
and is still in progress. The majority of sites in the county are on Jewett Mine property,
and most of our current knowledge of the prehistoric and early historic sites of the area
has been obtained from these studies.
At Jewett Mine, Voellinger and Freeman (1980:4-15) observed that all but two of
the sites are located in transitional zones. They found that the physiographic
transitional zones of the major creeks of the Jewett Mine area continually provided the
most attractive qualities for prehistoric populations. At Jewett Mine the average
horizontal distance to water was 131 meters, and 73 percent of the prehistoric sites are
located at or within 100 meters of water.
A scarcity of sites in areas of shallow soils was noted at Jewett Mine. Soil
probes on the terraces and upland breaks along the lower expanses of Mine Creek, for
example, repeatedly indicated less than 20 cm of soils over a clay base. In these areas
sites were absent. Beginning with the first deep sand hill upstream, however, an
abundance of prehistoric sites was found (Freeman and Voellinger 1982:2-62). One
suggestion for the preference of deep sandy soils is the possibility that certain plants
that prefer these deep soils were desired and exploited by prehistoric populations.

Freeman and Voellinger (1982:2-63) suggest that sites located on higher
terraces and upland margins are smaller in aerial extent and contain less material
cultural remains than those along the major creeks. The latter should represent
habitational sites with artifact assemblages reflecting the area's major occupations.
Features such as hearths, storage pits, and structural remains might be found in sites
along the major creeks while the smaller sites at higher elevations should contain
activity specific tool assemblages.
They (Freeman and Voellinger 1982:2-64) comment on the difficulty of assessing
site depth and size in the project area. Most sites contained a single flake in shovel
tests. According to them, "the general lack of surface evidence indicating the presence
of cultural manifestations will require testing far beyond the scope of an archaeological
survey to adequately address real site dimensions." The intensive shovel testing during
this survey sometimes failed to disclose a site's integrity. Many sites, for example, have
no obvious stratigraphy beyond the gradual change from humic sand to sand to clayey
sand.
The Millican Reservoir (Kotter 1982) involved a large area that included Brazos,
Grimes, Leon, Madison, and Robertson counties. This study recorded 13 previously
unrecorded archaeological sites (41RT132 - 41RT144). The sites in Robertson County
consist of prehistoric and historic sites. Kotter defines the majority of the prehistoric
sites as lithic scatters and campsites. Of special interest is the presence of single
ceramic sherds at sites 41RT136 and 41RT139. Testing was recommended for several
of the prehistoric sites. The only historic site was a bridge.
At least four studies have been conducted in the Calvert Mine area in northern
Robertson County. The most intensive of these is the 1986 season by the Texas
Archeological Survey, The University of Texas at Austin (Davis et al. 1987). This survey
investigated 4800 acres and found prehistoric sites to be mainly situated on knolls,
terraces, and hills adjacent to Walnut Creek or its major tributary streams. The potential
for significant sites in the area was evidenced by 41RT267, a prehistoric upland site
located at the confluence of two creeks containing five burned rock features, numerous
lithics, and four ceramic fragments. It was hypothesized by the excavators that
41RT267 represents a temporary field camp occupied by a hunting task force at least
during the Late Prehistoric and/or Late Ceramic periods (Davis et al. 1987:iv). Based
on the testing results this site was deemed eligible for inclusion in the National Register
of Historic Places. Site 41RT267 was excavated by the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin in 1992 (Robinson and Turpin 1993).

Project Specific Studies
A cultural resources survey of lands within the Twin Oak-Kosse study area
(Robertson and Limestone counties) was conducted by Espey, Huston & Associates,
Inc. in 1987 (Kotter et al. 1988). Prehistoric sites in the area date from the Middle
Archaic to the Late Prehistoric, and historic sites date from the 1870s. One
archaeological site (41RT426) found during this study is close to the current project
area. Site 41RT426 (Appendix I) is located on a rise at the base of the creek valley wall
and just above the Steele Creek floodplain and is described by Kotter et al. (1988:131)
as a "sparse lithic scatter of unknown age or cultural affiliation." Debitage was
recovered between 10 and 90 cm in three positive shovel tests. According to the
authors, this site is not eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.
It is on the south side of County Road 477 approximately 50 meters from the proposed
construction ROW.

PROJECT METHODS
The purpose of this archaeological survey was to locate any previously
unrecorded archaeological sites in the proposed Robertson County WSC water line
ROW and check the ROW for evidence of previously recorded prehistoric site 41RT426.
A records check for previously recorded sites in the project area and vicinity was
conducted for BVRA by Adrianne Mraz, Assistant Curator of Records at TARL.
According to the TARL records, the western segment of the area to be surveyed had
been previously investigated by the archaeological firm Espey, Huston & Associates in
1987 (Appendix I). This study found numerous archaeological sites. Of the sites
recorded, 41RT426 is the closest to the project area (Appendix I). Although this site
was not considered by Espey Huston archaeologists to be significant, the Texas
Historical Commission recommended that the ROW in this area be examined since the
level of work performed in the 1980s was not as thorough as today's efforts.
The field survey was performed using the pedestrian survey method supported
by shovel testing and probing. Shovel testing was concentrated in an area on an
upland ridge northeast of Steele Creek that had not been previously surveyed. In this
area, a sandy ridge was observed. This landform was thoroughly tested by seven
shovel tests. Next, the lower slopes of this upland area were examined by shovel
testing and probing. Much of the area between the uplands and the creek was
considered by the field survey crew to be low probability for archaeological sites. Along
this segment clay was encountered at or very near the surface, and numerous palmetto
plants were observed. The lower slopes and low-lying area north of Steele Creek
contained thick vegetation. It would be impossible to get a backhoe into this area
without cutting trees to make a path. The survey crew was able to test this area through
shovel testing. Since clay was found at the surface, this method was satisfactory.
Finally, the survey crew located the site of 41RT426 within an area previously
surveyed by archaeologists. The site is situated on a well defined hill about 50 meters
south of the project area ROW. Within the ROW is a low area that contains a shallow
water table. One shovel test was dug here, and it was concluded that no evidence of
this site extends to the project area.
Each shovel test was recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix II) and discussed
in the project notes. The excavated matrix was screened using 1/4 inch hardware cloth.
In all, 14 shovel tests were excavated. The locations of all shovel tests are depicted on
the relevant topographic map (Appendix III). No shovel testing was conducted outside
the 15 foot ROW. Shovel probes were dug with a shovel to help confirm the presence
of shallow soils in some areas in place of shovel tests. Probes were not screened,
numbered, or depicted on the field maps. Profiles were drawn of the shovel tests.
These drawings, along with other notes, are housed at BVRA. In a few cases,
road/highway cut banks were profiled with a shovel to determine the depth of clay. This
task eliminated unnecessary shovel testing in those areas where clay was found to be
shallow.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
This investigation covered the south side of County Road 477 on the east side of
Steele Creek and included a search for evidence of prehistoric site 41RT426 on the
west side of the creek on private property. Shovel testing revealed a shallow sandy
mantle in the upland area on the northeast side of Steele Creek. The ground surface
was virtually devoid of vegetation making surface visibility excellent. A thorough
inspection of the surface failed to reveal the presence of cultural materials. Shovel tests
in this area encountered clay between 10 and 40 cm. It is hypothesized here that the
shallow sandy soils and the distance from this landform to Steele Creek are the reasons
for the absence of a prehistoric archaeological site. The slope from the apex of this
ridge to the creek bank is viewed as a very low probability area for archaeological sites.
Shovel tests and probes revealed shallow clay. Numerous palmetto plants, an indicator
of a low-lying, often wet area, were observed. Previously recorded prehistoric site
41RT426 was found to be on a hill well outside the project area ROW. One shovel test
in the ROW encountered a very shallow water table.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The water line as currently planned will not affect any significant archaeological
sites. It is, therefore, recommended that Robertson County WSC be allowed to proceed
with construction with no restrictions. Should cultural materials be encountered in areas
not discussed in this report, all work should stop until the situation can be evaluated by
the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, in consultation with BVRA and
Robertson County WSC.
