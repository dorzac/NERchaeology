Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint of a proposed cellular tower
in central Hot Spring County, Arkansas. The Federal Communications Commission’s Nationwide
Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural resources survey be
conducted prior to such an undertaking. No Antiquities Permit was required, but subsequent
review of this archeological report was provided by the Arkansas State Historic Preservation
Officer (SHPO). The total area to be impacted is 10,000 square feet (0.23 acres).
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on July 22, 2014. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before six shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface, or in any of the six shovel tests.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to
oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archeological consultant, and by the Arkansas
SHPO.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

Introduction
AARCHER, Inc. is the consulting firm employed to acquire clearance for the erection of the
Sleepy Hollow Celluar Tower to be constructed in central Hot Spring County, Arkansas (Figures
1-3), and hereinafter occasionally referred to as the Project Area (PA). AARCHER contracted
with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct an archeological
investigation of the proposed tower site. Although no public funding was involved in the
proposed development of the property, the Federal Communications Commission’s Nationwide
Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural resources survey be
conducted prior to such an undertaking.

In July 2014, TAAI conducted a review of cultural resources documented either on, or within one
to two kilometers of the PA, as well as other documents that may be relative for significant
cultural resources to exist within the PA. The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
3

2) A review of the Arkansas archeological and historic site files in both Little Rock and
Fayetteville to identify what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what
archeological and historic sites have been documented within one to two kilometers of the project
area
3) A search of various websites that offer old maps of the PA
4) A literature review of both published and unpublished reports and manuscripts that describe
the types of archeological sites that have been documented, and thus provide insight as to the
types of sites that may be expected either in the PA, or immediately adjacent to it
6) A review of local soils maps in order to evaluate the potential for intact and buried cultural
materials either within or immediately adjacent to the PA. The proposed cell tower site is located
in a relatively rural area near Social Hill that has apparently been used primarily for agriculture,
and has otherwise been undisturbed.

Project Environment
Physiography, Hydrology, and Climate
The Project Area lies within central Hot Spring County, on the cusp of the Ouachita Mountains
and the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic regions of Arkansas. The Ouachita Mountains is the
oldest of these two, and covers the western portion of the county, while the Coastal Plain covers
the eastern portion. Chert, quartzite, and novaculite are common on the mountain ridgetops,
while tilted and fractured sandstone and shale is common on the side slopes and lower ridges.
Silty clays and silty loams are the predominant soils. The predominant wooded vegetation consists
of loblolly and shortleaf pines and bottomland hardwoods such as oak and hickory. The Coastal
Plain exhibits nearly level to moderately steep uplands that formed from marine sediments.
Intermingled within the Coastal Plain are patches of the Blackland Prairie underlain by marl or
chalk bedrock. Silty loams support the growth of scattered hardwoods and pines, as well as
prairie grasses (Foti 1974; Bates 1980; Hoelscher 1987).
The Ouachita River flows in a southerly direction, and is the major drainage basin in the middle
of the county, while streams in the northwestern portion of the county drain north into Lake
Hamilton, and streams in the eastern portion of the county empty into the Saline River. The
modern climate in the Project Area is manifested by very warm and relatively long summers
driven primarily from moist, tropical air moving north from the Gulf of Mexico. The average daily
maximum temperature in Summer is 920F. Winters on the other hand, are relatively short, with
rare cold snaps. The average daily minimum temperature in Winter is 330F. The average annual
precipitation in Hot Spring County is 54 inches (Hoelscher 1987).

Cultural Chronology

The location of the Sleepy Hollow Celluar Tower survey area presumes cultural affinities
indigenous to the Ozark-Arkansas-Ouachita Archeological Region. Several scholars have offered
sound but differing arguments for cultural chronologies for the region, however the cultural
chronology, defined by horizon (in lieu of the terms phase, interval, or period) of the region has
been synthesized by Sabo et al. (1982), Sabo and Early (1988), and Early and Sable (1988). The
following discussions are primarily derived from their syntheses, and a summation is presented
in Table 1. All prehistoric dates are approximate and given as years before present (B.P. [i.e,
before 1950]).

Pre-Clovis
Although humans may have inhabited the landscape before 12,000 B.P, solid evidence does not
yet support their existence. As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to
yield solid stratigraphic proof of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find
earlier occupations on stable landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture?
The Gault Site in Bell County, Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of
North America, and with artifacts stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely
has the best chances of providing conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture (Adavasio and
Page 2002:292-294; Collins and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014). In Arkansas, no evidence has
thus far been found of a pre-Clovis occupation. Although, a possible exception but not as yet
proven conclusive, is the discovery of a Sandia-like biface discovered with probable elephant
remains at the Albertson Shelter in Dallas County (Dickson 1991).
Paleoindian Horizon
The Paleoindian horizon began toward the close of the Pleistocene. The diagnostic artifact most
associated with this period/horizon is the fluted Clovis projectile point. Other artifacts associated
with the Clovis culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory
points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft straighteners. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type
points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of
the people who made them.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). By far, the most robust collection of
Paleindian artifacts in North America has been recovered at the Gault Site in Bell County, Texas.
Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian artifacts have been recovered, with only
about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far (Gault Site 2014).
Although Clovis points have been documented in southern Arkansas, they have all been surface
finds (Jeter and Williams 1989a). In Arkansas, a transitional complex of artifacts with dart points
called “Dalton” are present (e.g. Goodyear 1974).
Dalton Horizon
As the warming that marks the transition from Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene climates began
to take effect in Arkansas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic
shift is also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant
bison (Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were either extinct or otherwise
extricated from the region. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer and other
medium-size, or smaller game. Dalton projectile points are found on sites dating to this timeframe.
7

Some researchers (e.g., Story et al. 1990) suggest that the Dalton point is a transitional point that
developed from eastern Clovis cultures. Also found on Dalton sites in Arkansas are stone adzes
and ground stones, suggesting a heavier reliance of plants for subsistence (Goodyear 1974;
McMillan 1971). Despite significant Dalton components documented at sites such as the
Ferguson Site (3HE63) and Coon Island (3BR10), settlement patterns are still not well
understood (Schambach and Early 1982).
Another projectile point thought to be associated with this horizon is another fluted specimen
called “San Patrice”. This relatively smaller Dalton point variant style extends from the Rocky
Mountains to the south Atlantic coast (Turner et al. 2011). San Patrice points have been found
in northwest Arkansas, the Little Rock area, and extending into the southwest Missouri area
(Dickson 1991). Not infrequently, Albany scrapers are also discovered in San Patrice
components. These are thought to be either hafted spokeshaves or beveled scrapers fashioned
from re-worked projectile points (Turner et al. 2011). Changes in the subsistence base required
technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic in Arkansas is approximated at 8000-9500 B. P. (Sabo et al. 1988). The
extinction of large herds of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene
stimulated a behavioral change by Prehistoric inhabitants. While the basic hunter-gatherer
adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was
necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources such as deer, fish, and plant
bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked rock cooking
features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and Guadalupe bifaces (Turner
et al. 2011). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were small and highly mobile, an
inference from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed and that diagnostic types are
seen across a wide area. Story (1985), however, believes that population densities were low
during this period, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with “few
constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Admittedly, the Early Archaic horizon in the
Ouachita Region of Arkansas is poorly understood. Possibly the best representation of Early
Archaic components in the region have been examined at the Cooper Site (3HE1 [Schambach
1970]).
The warming climate toward the end of the Early Archaic caused many streams to dry up, and
prairie-land vegetation expanded as oak-savanna areas decreased in size. This presumably caused
humans into a greater reliance on the remaining riverine environs in order to exploit aquatic fish
and turtles. This then, marks a somewhat blurred transition to the Middle Archaic Horizon in
Arkansas.
Middle Archaic
The Ouachita Middle Archaic horizon, as influenced from changes in climate and manifested by
changes in subsistence strategies, is generally recognized as the period between 5000–8000 B.P.
(Schambach and Early 1982). However, both the nature of the climate and environment, and
human adaptation in the Ouachita Region during this period is once again, poorly understood.
8

Although, Jeter and Williams (1989a) observe that an increase in numbers and variety of grinding
stones, and changes in projectile point styles suggest an expanded diet breadth, with a greater
reliance on plant resources as the climate became drier beginning around 7550 BP.
Schambach and Early (1982) posit that a culture labeled as “Tom’s Brook” may have been
prevalent during the Middle Archaic in the Ouachita Mountain area, evidenced by significant
components discovered at the Paw Paw Site (3OU22), the Gulpha Site (3GA20), and the Goat
Island Site (3GA9). The Johnson point is diagnostic of Tom’s Brook. The Johnson dart point is
a medium-sized, unfluted type found in northeast Texas, southwest Arkansas, east Oklahoma, and
northwest Louisiana (Turner et al. 2011).
Three Middle Archaic phases have been identified in the Ouachita Region. Fish net sinkers
fashioned from pebbles and Big Sandy projectile points make up a portion of the Crystal
Mountain phase. At the Jones Mill Site, Trubitt (2009) has recovered Big sandy points in
associated contexts dated to 7070±40 BP. Williams dart points are characteristic of White Oak
phase components. Williams points are also widely spread, being found in central and north
Texas, Oklahoma, northwest Louisiana and western Arkansas (Jeter and Williams 1989a; Turner
et al. 2011). The third phase, the Dorcheat phase, is recognizable by the presence of Bulverde and
Evans points. The Evans point has been found in east Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas (Turner
et al. 2011). Sabo et al. (1988) further identify Rice, Frio, Ellis, and Edgewood types as
diagnostic to the Middle Archaic.
Late Archaic
The beginning of the Late Archaic marked a transition from a warmer, drier climate to one we
know more today, with increased moisture, relatively fewer open grasslands, and a concurrent
increase in woodlands (Sabo et al. 1988). Of significance, is the ‘possible’ introduction of
domesticated plants and some degree of horticultural or agricultural practices. Although no
evidence of early plant domestication has as yet been discovered in Arkansas, King (1980) reports
on squash and gourd domestication at the Phillips Spring Site in western Missouri.
Diagnostic point types characteristic of the Wister phase include Gary, Marshall, Marcos, Lange,
Williams, and Palmillas; all of these types are commonly found in adjacent states (e.g., Turner et
al. 2011). Together with bone tools such as atlatl hooks, awls, and fish hooks, along with pitted
and ground stones suggest intensive seasonal occupations where midden mounds have formed
as a result (Galm 1981; Wyckoff 1984). Transitional nuances are seen in the archeological record
from the Late Archaic Wister phase to the Woodland Fourche Maline Culture.
Woodland Period
The Fourche Maline Culture in the Ouachita area appears to be a continuation of adaptations to
the environment that humans developed during the preceding Wister phase (Haag 1961; Sabo et
al. 1988). The Woodland Period, appears to have been an era of widespread exchanges of ideas
and goods. The manufacturing and/or trade of pottery is introduced, and mound building is more
common (Webb 1977, 1981). Ceremonial burial practices are now common, with flexed skeletons
interred in shallow graves, as well as cremations, and burial mounds. These burial practices, along
9

with evidence that suggests a greater dependence on cultivated plants implies an increasingly
complex cultural society during this period (Schambach and Early 1982; Jeter and Williams
1989a). A characteristic artifact assemblage of the Fourche Maline Culture includes Williams
Plain pottery, Gary dart points, double bitted axes, and boatstones.
Other than the Fourche Maline Culture, manifestations of the Tchefuncte Culture have been
observed south of the Ouachita Region. These would include Tchefuncte Incised, Tchefuncte
Stamped, and Lake Borgne Incised pottery found at Coon Island ([3BR10] [Schambach and Early
1982]). In addition, Tchefuncte sherds were discovered at the Cooper Site ([3HE1] [Ford and
Quimby 1945]). Minor cultural affiliations that based upon pottery sherds found, may have
possible influences in the Ouachta Region include Marksville, Baytown, and Coles Creek
(Schambach and early 1982).
Mississippian Period
Schambach and Early (1982), and Jeter and Williams (1989b-d) divide this period into five
regional cultural horizons within the broader contexts of the larger Mississippian cultural
tradition: Caddo Horizons I thru V. Over 50 Caddoan and Missississippian archeological sites
have been recorded in Hot Spring County (Mintz 1990). The period is marked by extensive
agricultural practices, while hunting and foraging played a lesser role. Hierarchal societies
developed during this timeframe, emphasizing social rankings, civic ceremonial centers, and elite
to common burial practices. It was during this period that the bow and arrow was introduced and
new techniques were developed in the manufacture of pottery. Small farmsteads focused on
growing maize, and hamlets grew around ceremonial centers.
The Spanish European contact that occurred in AD 1541-1542 during Caddo IV profounded the
Caddoan way of life, introducing trade goods, such as metal tools, guns, and beads, as well as
European diseases. Caddo V is considered to have brought about a marked and steady decline
in the Caddoan culture and population. Nevertheless, new pottery types such as Natchitoches
Engraved and Keno Trailed were developed during this horizon (Schambach and Early 1982).
Early European Exploration and Settlement
As discussed above, it is likely that Europeans first contacted Arkansas Native American tribes
in 1541 when Hernando de Soto entered the area. De Soto was probably near the Ouachita and
Little Missouri rivers when they first met the Tula, Amaye, Quapaw, Osage, and other Caddoan
tribes (e.g., Swanton 1952). At that time the Quapaw were tethered to villages near the
confluence of the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers, and utilized the area between the Arkansas and
Red rivers as their hunting lands (Chapman 1959, 1975). Before around 1802, the Osage were
likely hunting in northern Arkansas, but then moved south and settled in what is today the Hot
Spring County area (Johnson 1957). During this somewhat tumultuous era, in order to survive
Native Americans hunted deer, beaver, buffalo, and turkey, fished in the rivers and streams, raised
corn, squash, and pumpkins, and gathered wild roots, plants, and seasonally available fruits and
nuts.
Shortly after the Spanish acquired the territory from the French in 1763, they established a land
10

grant system to parcel out land ownership to newly arriving Europeans. By 1798, there were 368
white settlers in Arkansas (Hempstead 1911). Turmoil among Native American groups being
forced into and out of the region intensified. It has been surmised that perhaps the Caddos
abandoned western Arkansas due to Osage and other renegade raiding parties encouraged by
French and English traders. However, other reports indicate that the Caddo, Wichita, Osage, and
Choctaw continued to use the area for hunting (Wyckoff and Brooks 1983). Meanwhile, in an
effort to thwart American and British interests in the region, the Spanish Crown encouraged
Cherokees, Delawares, and Kickapoos to move in. After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the
Choctaws, Chickasaws, Creeks, and Seminoles were relocated to the region (Sabo et al. 1988).
American Settlement in Arkansas
The Arkansas Territory was created in 1819. Although transportation through the territory would
continue to somewhat impede settlement, the Old Military Road from St. Louis passed through
in 1817, and settlers began penetrating the Ozark and Oauchita mountains (Shinn 1967). The
rivers proved to be main lines of travel in the 1800s, until railroads were constructed through the
territory after the Civil War. Steamboats plied both the Arkansas and Ouachita rivers in the 1820s
and ‘30s, and stagecoach routes were operational between Little Rock, Hot Springs, and
Arkansas Post (Johnson 1957). Early settlers grazed livestock in valley pastures until the grass
was depleted, and then they moved on, resulting in a series of seasonal and permanent cabins
along the major streams (Owsley 1945). Later, settlers migrating in from Kentucky, Tennessee,
and North Carolina began clearing the forests and established permanent farmsteads. Many were
enticed by the passage of the Land Act of 1820 which made large tracts of land more affordable.
When the railroads were constructed in the Arkansas Territory, local farmers were provided
access to imported goods, as well as a means of shipping livestock and diversified farm products.
As a result, railroad towns, lumber industries in particular, and mining venturers after bauxite,
kaolin, slate, quartz, novaculite, coal, and dolomite prospered (Sabo et al. 1988). With such a
bustling economy, rich resources, and increasing population, it was inevitable that Arkansas
would be admitted to the Union as the 25th state on June 15, 1836. Lumber and minerals
continued to be exploited, and from roughly 1880 through 1920, the logging industry in Arkansas
boomed. The need for forest management was realized in the 1930s, and the logging industry in
modern-day Arkansas is still very much an important resource.

Archeological and Historic Site Files Research
A review of archeological site files at the Arkansas Archeological Survey Office in Fayetteville
on July 17, 2014 revealed that four archeological surveys had been conducted within 2 kilometers
of the proposed Sleepy Hollow Cellular Tower site, and nine archeological sites had been
recorded within 2 kilometers. A review of the Historic Structures files at the Arkansas State
Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) in Little Rock revealed that two historic structures had been
recorded within 1 kilometer. No cultural resources were known to exist either within, or in close
proximity to the proposed Sleepy Hollow Cell Tower site

11

Previous Archeological Surveys Within 2 Kilometers
In 1989, archaeologists with the Sponsored Research Program of the Arkansas Archeological
Survey conducted a pedestrian survey with shovel testing along a proposed 10-kilometer (6-mile)
linear gas line from Social Hill to central Hot Spring County. Although eight previously
undiscovered archeological sites were documented, none were assessed to be negatively
impacted by construction of the gas line (Mintz 1990).
In 1996, Arkansas Archeological Survey archeologists conducted a linear survey with shovel
testing along 13 miles of right-of-way for a proposed water expansion pipeline running from Oak
Grove to Social Hill in Hot Spring County. Although two previously undocumented archeological
sites were discovered, neither was assessed as significant so as to be adversely impacted by
construction of the pipeline (Stewart 1996).
In 1999, Marion Butler of the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department reported
to the Arkansas Historic Preservation Program Office that rehabilitation and resurfacing of 6.8
miles of IH-30 in Hot Spring County would not adversely impact any significant cultural
resources (Butler 1999).
In 2001, Historic Preservation Associates (HPA) archaeologists conducted a cultural resources
survey of 44.4 acres near Jones Mill, Social Hill, and DeRoche as part of a proposed habitation
mitigation area for the Kimzey Regional Water System. Archaeologists documented one site
(3HS156) within the Area of Potential Effect (APE). After shovel testing the site, they determined
that it had been heavily disturbed, but some evidence of a Tom’s Brook phase culture existed, and
they therefore recommended that the proposed mitigation corridor be moved so as to avoid the
site (Klinger et al. 2001).
Previously Recorded Archeological Sites Within 2 Kilometers
3HS2 – This site is situated near the confluence of Blakely Creek and the Oauchita River, some
2 kilometers (km) from the proposed Sleepy Hollow Cell Tower site. It was first documented by
Lynn Howard. According to the files on record, there seems to be some confusion as to the site’s
exact location and the cultural material observed at the time.
3HS515 – First documented in 1961, this is known as the Denham Mound Site. In 1961, W.
Raymond Wood conducted excavations on Mound I at the Denham Site (3HS15), a MidOuachita Focus Temple Mound situated on the Ouachita River bottom in Hot Spring County.
It was part of a salvage effort in advance of the private landowner’s desire to bulldoze the mound
and turn the area into farmland. Test excavations revealed that the mound encompassed three
successive stages of construction with remnants of post holes, burned timbers, and pottery sherds.
Archaeologists determined that this Caddoan Mid-Ouachita Focus mound dated to roughly A.D.
1200-1600, and its final apex was pyramidal and truncated, with a ramp leading to the top (Wood
1963).

12

3ES111 – This site is known as the Governor Adkins Place. It is lies on a high terrace
overlooking Blakely Creek. When documented in 1977 by Ann Early, she noted that when she
visited the site it was overgrown and did not observe any artifacts. However, artifacts reportedly
from the site and a private collector are housed at Henderson State University. The collection
contains 20 pieces of chipped stone, as well as an abundant quantity of ceramic sherds, and whole
or restored vessels. The cultural affiliation is unknown.
3HS191 – Documented in 1986 by Ann Early and Jack Terry, this site provides evidence for
Archaic, Fourche Maline, possibly Caddoan,Tom’s Brook, and Crystal Mountain cultural
affiliations. The Ouachita River courses some 150 meters (m) east of the site. Stone tools
collected include 12 Gary-like points, 1 stemmed point, 10 arrow points, 6 small ovate bifaces,
3 biface fragments, 3 drills, 4 scrapers, 20 preforms, 1 large chopper, and 2 worked crystals. In
addition, 1 celt and 1 celt preform were collected. Numerous pottery sherds in the collection
include an incised rim and an incised body sherd.
3HS329 – This mid-19th century site was identified on an 1857 General Land Office (GLO) map
by Ann Early in 1990 as part of the GLO Mapping Project. The site, which appears as a
rectangular plot on the map, is situated immediately west of the Ouachita River. According to the
UTM coordinates provided by Early, the site lies some 1.6 km southeast of the proposed Sleepy
Hollow Cell Tower site.
3HS334 – This is another mid-19th century site that was identified on an 1857 General Land
Office (GLO) map by Ann Early in 1990 as part of the GLO Mapping Project. This site is
situated on the north edge of Prairie Creek. According to the UTM coordinates provided by
Early, the site lies some 2 km southwest of the proposed Sleepy Hollow Cell Tower site.
3HS623 – This is an isolated, large triangular biface, probably made of quartz, and found by Jack
Terry in May 2005. It was recovered on an eroded terrace near the confluence of Blakely Creek
and the Ouachita River that had mined for shale (an open pit mine).
3HS626 – Jack Terry documented this site in June 2005, and called it “The Gravel Pit Site”. Prior
to that, he had visited the site in the 1960s and’70s. It sets on a weathered terrace adjacent to the
old Oauchita River channel. Artifacts observed suggest a Mississipian cultural affiliation, and
include a quartz arrow point, novaculite arrow points, a celt axe, smoothed slate pieces, and
novaculite flakes.
3HS630 – In April 2005, Jack Terry also documented this prehistoric lithic scatter consisting of
novaculite flakes. It is situated on a low mound near the confluence of Blakely Creek and the
Oauchita River. When Terry visited the site in 2005, a large home had been built on top of it. No
cultural affiliation can be affirmed.

HS44 – The Adam B. Blakely House, a.k.a. the Governor Adkins House, a.k.a. the Francis Ward
House, is a one-story log house that has been modernized and modified with frame additions. It
was reportedly the summer home of Governor Homer Adkins, who served as Governor of
Arkansas from 1941-1943.
HS45 – This structure is a T-shaped frame and clapboard Victorian house built around 1895, with
a gabled roof, boxed cornices, decorative gable brackets, and a porch balustrade. It is now known
as “The Hodges House”.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archeological and historical issues that could be addressed by the
types of data obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed
were site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.
Methods
In Accordance with Arkansas State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) Survey Standards, a
systematic and thorough pedestrian survey of the delineated 10,000-square foot tract was
conducted. Soils matrices from the six shovel tests were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh.
In accordance with a designed research plan, all redundant artifacts recovered from shovel tests
were not to be collected, but were to be placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test.
Excavation of the shovel tests were terminated either at 60 centimeters below the surface (cmbs),
or in Pleistocene soils if shallower than 60 cm.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
The immediate
area of the
tower footprint
area appeared to
have been
previously
disturbed due to
clearing of
w o o d e d
vegetation and
f a r m i n g
activities.
Because of the
dense grasses
across the site,
surface visibility
was 30 percent
at best (Figure
5).

were placed
within the tower’s footprint as well as an access right-of-way into the tower site from Sleepy
Hollow Road (Figure 6). The results of shovel testing were recorded on standard shovel test
forms, are on file at Tierras Antiguas Archeological Investigations, and are available upon
request. Table 2 presents the results of shovel testing (ST) in centimeters below the surface
(cmbs), with dry soil colors based upon a Munsell color chart. Soils were evaluated based upon
standard Soil Conservation Service guidelines (see Appendix A). No cultural material was
observed either on the surface or in any of the six shovel tests.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface that offered limited visibility within the Project Area
was conducted, and six shovel tests were excavated, but no evidence of neither prehistoric nor
historic occupation was found. Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as
currently designed by the project sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect”
on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed
without further archeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during
construction within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds
are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archeological consultant, and
by the Arkansas State Historic Preservation Office.
