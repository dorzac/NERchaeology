ABSTRACT
A Phase I cultural resources survey for a proposed wastewater treatment plant
expansion project (8.5 acres) in the corporate limits of Brenham, Texas was performed
by Brazos Valley Research Associates in August 2002. The presence of one
abandoned house, three vacant house sites, and ten mobile homes, and various
storage sheds, cattle pens, and barns have contributed to the overall disturbance of the
project area. The frame house was moved to its current site from its original location
approximately 20 years ago. It is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places
or for listing as a State Archeological Landmark.
The area was investigated with a backhoe, and no significant archaeological
sites were found. Other than recent historic trash on the surface, the only cultural
materials observed were two 20th century medicine bottle fragments that probably
washed down the creek from an existing landfill located upstream. All backhoe
trenches were dug to clay. It is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed
as planned. Copies of the report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission (THC),
Archeological Division; the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) on the
University of Texas campus; Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) ; and the City
of Brenham.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Brenham plans to expand its wastewater facility adjacent to an
existing site on a 8.5 acre tract in the corporate limits of the City of Brenham in a
residential area in central Washington County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed
construction plans calls for removal of all structures. Next, the area will be scraped, and
the elevation of the south end will be lowered in order to allow for construction of the
improvements. Lastly, a wastewater treatment plant will be constructed in the recontoured area. The project area is bounded on the north by Hog Branch, on the south
by Old Chappell Hill Road, on the east by Don Austin Lane, and on the west by Farmto-Market 577 (Horton Street). The project area map (Figure 2) was created from an
engineering map prepared by O'Malley Engineers, and is depicted on the 7.5' U.S.G.S.
topographic quadrangle Brenham, Texas dated 1963 and photorevised 1989 (Figure 3).
Washington County is one of the earliest areas in Texas to be settled by
members of Austin's "Old Three Hundred" who arrived in the 1820s. Washington
County is one of the original counties of Texas, was created in 1836 and organized in
1837, and named after George Washington. The town of Brenham became the county
seat in 1844. The topography of the county consists of rolling prairies of sandy loam
drained by the Brazos River and its tributaries. No soils book was available for
Washington County at the time of this study.
Because the project area is located adjacent to an apparent dependable source
of water (Hog Branch) in a region known to contain significant archaeological sites, the
site of the proposed wastewater treatment plant was considered likely to contain
evidence of prehistoric and/or historic sites. Therefore, a Phase I cultural resource
survey was required by the THC. In order to satisfy this requirement, the City of
Brenham retained BVRA to perform the archaeological survey which was carried out on
August 26, 2002 under Antiquities Permit 2940. The Principal Investigator for this
project was William E. Moore.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Washington County is located in the Central and Southern Planning Region as
defined by the THC (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996). This region is divided into smaller
units, and Washington County (based on this division) belongs to the Central Coastal
Plains Archeological Region (Mercado-Allinger et al 1996:Figure 1.1.4). It is only one
county removed from the Central Texas Archeological Region to the north and borders
the Southern Coastal Corridor Archeological Region to the south. No sites in
Washington County listed as significant or critical appear in the Planning Document
prepared by the THC. However, due to its proximity to other regions it is likely that
Washington County shares cultural traits with its neighboring counties. According to a
statistical overview prepared by the Office of the State Archeologist (Biesaart et al.
1985), there were only 16 sites recorded in the county in 1985. At that time, the number
of sites in the county represented only .08% of the total for Texas. In 1985, 8 sites in
Washington County were listed as Archaic and 8 were listed as Late Prehistoric, and all
16 sites experienced some form of disturbance
A background check at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed that Washington County
has a relatively low number of documented archaeological sites (n=68) as compared to
other counties in the state. Most of these sites have been recorded as the result of
salvage work at Lake Somervell or during oil and gas related projects. Other sites have
been recorded by individuals such as Nathan L. Winfield, Jr. who recorded 41WT7 41WT11 and 41WT13. The majority of the remainder of sites in Washington County
have been recorded or evaluated by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (41WT42 41WT47; 41WT60; 41WT65), Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (41WT25 - 41WT29;
41WT33 - 41WT40; 41WT48 - 41WT55; 41WT63 - 41WT64), the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (41WT62), Texas Archeological Salvage Project (41WT1 41WT4) Texas A&M University (41WT17 - 41WT18), and the United States Corps of
Engineers, Galveston District (41WT30 - 41WT31). The earliest record of professional
archaeological activity in Washington County was at Boggy Creek where Dee Ann
Suhm and Rudolph C. Troike of the University of Texas visited the area and assisted
Nathan L. Winfield, Jr. in a survey of this area in 1955 (Hasskarl 1961). Three areas
containing cultural materials were examined; the Central Midden site, the South Knoll
site, and the Creek site. Later, they were recorded together as 41WT12. In the Central
Midden site arrow point types Perdiz and Scallorn were found in the top level mixed with
dart point types Gary, Morrill, and Palmillas. Although Gary points were found in all
levels, only the lower levels contained Kent, Pedernales, Edgewood, Ellis, Ensor, and
Yarbrough. The Central Midden site and the South Knoll site contained an abundance
of fresh water mussel shells and are described by Hasskarl (1961:298) as shell
middens. The Creek site contained hearthstone fragments in addition to mussel shell.
Unidentifiable ceramics were found at the Central Midden and Creek sites. Faunal
remains from the three areas include mussel shell, deer, and antelope. Based on the
records check at TARL, this is the only site in Washington County that has been tested.
Since valuable subsistence and chronological data were obtained from this project,
researchers are advised to consult this article for additional information.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Principal Investigator contacted TARL and
requested a records check in order to identify any previously recorded archaeological
sites in the project area and immediate vicinity. According to Jean Hughes, no sites
have been identified in the current project area.
The field survey was conducted utilizing the pedestrian survey method supported
by backhoe trenching. The only trenches containing soil suitable for screening were
those yielding sandy loam in the upper levels. Soil from trenches 4-6 would not pass
through the 1/4" screen. Trench 4 consisted of only 20 cm of sandy loam over red
sandy clay, trench 5 contained 30 cm of tan silt over black clay, and trench 6 contained
90 cm of dark gray clay loam over red clay. Six backhoe trenches were placed on all
types of landforms present in the project area (Figure 2) such as the floodplain (n=2),
hillside (n=2), and top of hill (n=2). The project was documented by project notes and a
backhoe trench log (Appendix I). The backhoe trenches were sketched in the field, and
they are reproduced as profile drawings in Appendix II to this report.
At the time of the field survey there was one abandoned wooden frame house of
pier and beam construction. This house is not in its original location, having been
moved there approximately 20 years ago. Its age is unknown. Although BVRA did not
view it to be architecturally or historically significant, photographs of all four elevations of
this structure were taken with a digital camera so its significance can be assessed by
the Architectural Historian at the THC (Appendix III). Timothy W. Robertson of O'Malley
Engineers, Inc. in Brenham stated that there were three additional frame houses in the
project area at one time. Two of these were moved prior to the field survey. The third
one burned, and the site was cleared with a bulldozer.
Also present in the project area were ten mobile homes. They are not
architecturally or historically significant and are less than 50 years old. In addition, there
were storage sheds; cattle pens; small barns; and cement slabs that were used as
patios, porch slabs, or driveways for mobile homes. No photographs of the mobile
homes or other features were taken.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
No prehistoric archaeological sites were found within the 8.5 acre project area.
The six backhoe trenches revealed a variety of soil types. No fine sandy loam was
encountered, although silty loam was found in four of the trenches. The project area is
viewed by BVRA to be low probability for the presence of significant prehistoric sites
due to the lack of deep sandy soils found through backhoe trenching and the fact that
much of the project area is on a hillside.
At the time of the survey there was one abandoned frame house (Figure 2;
Appendix III) and ten mobile homes in the project area. The house, located at 1901 Old
Chappel Hill Road (Ray House), is not in its original location as it was moved to the
current project area about 20 years ago according to Lowel Ogle, Regulatory and
Environmental Manager for the City of Brenham (personal communication to William E.
Moore, October 3, 2002). The age of the house is not known. Two of the mobile
homes were inhabited, and the remaining eight were abandoned. The Ray House is
viewed by BVRA as lacking architectural and historical significance. There were also
the footprints of three additional houses that were once present in the project area. The
Hubert House (House 2) was never owned by the city and was relocated prior to this
survey. The Thomas House (House 3) was owned by the city, but was moved to
another lot prior to this survey. The last house (House 4) was never owned by the city.
It burned and was bulldozed prior to this survey. In addition, there were several cement
areas that served as patios, porch slabs, and/or driveways for the mobile homes as well
as storage buildings and sheds, cattle pens, and barns in the project area. Table 1
depicts the existing structures and features present in the project area.
Much of the project area has been disturbed by the construction and installation
of these homes, as well as a residential road (Ray Lane) that services some of the
residences to the west of the project area (Figure 2). Recent historic trash is very
common throughout the project area in the vicinity of the current and former residences.
One bottleneck and one almost complete bottle were found in Backhoe Trench 1.
They were quite deep and may have been deposited in a layer of tan silt below a layer
of dark gray sandy loam. The silt was found to be between 160 and 210 cm below the
existing surface of the Hog Branch floodplain. The bottle fragments were not collected.
No other historic artifacts were observed in this trench in either layer. The two bottle
fragments are medicine bottles that were sealed with a cork. They date from the latter
part of the 19th century to sometime in the 20th century. According to Lowell Ogle,
Regulatory and Environmental Manager for the City of Brenham (personal
communication, August 26, 2002), numerous old bottles have been found in a city
landfill located upstream. It is believed that the two bottle fragments found by the
survey crew were washed downstream from the landfill and deposited in the project
area.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No significant archaeological sites were found during this cultural resources
survey. Therefore, it is the recommended that the City of Brenham be allowed to
proceed with construction as planned. Should, however, cultural materials be identified
in areas not discussed in this report, all work should cease until the situation can be
evaluated by the THC, BVRA, and the City of Brenham.
