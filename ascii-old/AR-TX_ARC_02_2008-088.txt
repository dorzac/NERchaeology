ABSTRACT

The City of Arlington through Republic Waste Management is proposing
to expand the existing landfill capacity. The landfill is located just west of
State Highway 157 (Collins Street) and north of the West Fork of the
Trinity River and south of the existing railroad line that is situated at the
north edge of the floodplain. The City has recently acquired 194 acres of
land west of the existing landfill for the purpose of landfill expansion.
However, much of this land was impacted by sand and gravel mining
operations, and is too disturbed to warrant any cultural resource
exploration. The study area consists of approximately 105 acres which is
situated along the north bank of the West Fork and include the lower
reaches of Walker Branch as well as the hill just to north which has
historically been used as a dirt bike track. Although, neither the City of
Arlington nor Republic Waste Management intends to utilize the study
area, they decided that “due diligence” was required; therefore, an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the study area was required.
The archaeological survey was conducted by AR Consultants, Inc. for
KBA EnviroScience, Ltd. which is managing the environmental
permitting for the City of Arlington and Republic Waste Management.
During the survey, 25 backhoe trenches and 28 shovel tests were
excavated. The survey resulted in the recording of three prehistoric shell
lens middens and hearth sites (41TR227, 228 and 229).
Sites 41TR227, 228 and 229 may be eligible for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places since their extent and content is not
totally known. Should future excavation occur in the area, these sites
should be investigated further.
However, since the City of Arlington and Republic Waste Management
have maintained that there are no plans to excavate in the study area in the
future, we make no other recommendations.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Arlington through Republic Waste Services of Texas, Ltd. (Republic) is
proposing to expand the existing landfill capacity. The site is located just west of State
Highway (SH) 157 (Collins Street) and north of the West Fork of the Trinity River and
south of the existing railroad line that is situated at the north edge of the floodplain
(Figure 1). The entire land fill site including the land recently acquired for expansion
covers approximately 745 acres, and 650 of the acres are included in either the active or
closed landfill cells or in a gravel pit area [the West Expansion Area] that is just west of
the West Disposal Area and the western of two Historic Fill Areas. The remaining 105
acres are situated along the north bank of the West Fork and include the lower reaches of
Walker Branch. This area that includes Walker Branch is west of the West Expansion
Area, and is referred to as the Surber Tract. The northern part of the Surber Tract, which
has historically been used as a dirt bike track, was not included in the survey area.
Although, neither the City of Arlington nor Republic Waste Services intends to utilize the
study area, they decided that “due diligence” was required; therefore, an intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey of the study area was required.
During the later part of October of 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed landfill extension as a component of the
404 Individual Permit application to the US Army Corps of Engineers. The work was
coordinated for KBA EnviroScience, Ltd. which is managing the environmental
permitting for Republic Waste Services and the City of Arlington. The purpose of the
archaeological survey was to determine if cultural materials older than 50 years were
present, and, if so, make recommendations about their significance and how they might
be impacted by construction.
The cultural resource investigation was required because the City of Arlington is a
political entity of the State of Texas and Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5041 was
issued for the archaeological survey. In addition, since the landfill site is to be placed
within the West Fork of the Trinity River’s floodplain, it falls within the jurisdiction of
the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Relevant federal legislation
includes the National Historic Preservation Policy Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515),
the National Environmental Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), the Clean Water Act, as amended
PL92500 and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission not only will review this report as the State Agency, but also as
the Section 106 review agency.
This report is written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission, and developed by the Council
of Texas Archeologists (N.D.). The following report presents a brief description of the
natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the archaeology and
history. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed in the investigation
is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes with
recommendations followed by the references cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area is located on the north bank of the West Fork floodplain and on a ridge
overlooking the West Fork. The study area lies in the Crosstell-Gasil-Rader and FrioTrinity Soil Associations (Ressel 1981:General Soils Map). The Crosstell-Gasil-Rader
consists of nearly level to sloping upland loams whereas the Trinity-Frio contains nearly
level floodplain clays. The upland ridge consists of Silawa fine sandy loam with 3 to 8
percent slopes and loamy Arents and the West Fork’s floodplain contains frequently
flooded Trinity clay. The quarry area consists of frequently flooded Arents and frequently
flooded Pulexas fine sandy loam is located between the quarry area and the upland ridge
(Ressel 1981:Sheet 32) The B horizon for the Silawa series is described as being 6 inches
(9 cm) (Ressel 1981:107) below the ground surface.
The underlying geology consists of the Eagle Ford Shale Formation which is covered by
Quaternary age terraces along the proposed pipeline route (Bureau of Economic Geology
1988). The channel of the West Fork is mapped as containing Quaternary alluvium.
The West Fork has incised a wide floodplain through both Lower Cretaceous- and Upper
Cretaceous-aged bedrock and reached its lowest base level about 18,000 years ago
(Ferring 1986:Figure 4). Since then, it has alluviated as carrying capacity varied and
aggradation increased. The meandering channel has left behind a series of sloughs and
cut-off meanders which apparently stabilized about 2,000 years ago (Ferring in
Shaunessy, Jurney, and Yedlowski 1994:5). These geological processes have buried a
complex web of channel and levee deposits which span the past 20,000 years.
Remnants of a bottomland hardwood forest occur in the West Fork floodplain and in a
pre-1900 condition it would have provided habitat for deer, quail, dove, rabbit, squirrel,
raccoon and other animals (Jurney 1988; Martin 1988; Ressel 1981:57). The bottomland
hardwood forest is a western extension of the forest from downstream on the Trinity (US
Fish and Wildlife Service 1985). In its native state, elm and post oak were the dominant
trees, along with hackberry and Spanish oak. Various fruit and nut producing species
included bur oak, red haw, walnut, pecan, gum bumelia and mulberry. Upland tree cover
outside of the valley was composed primarily of post oak and blackjack oak (Peter and
Jurney 1988).
A consensus about the paleoenvironmental conditions of North-Central Texas over the
past 12,000 years has not been reached. Discussions by Prikryl (1993), Ferring (1990),
Humphrey and Ferring (1994) and Brown (1998) offer disparate interpretations based on
different analytical approaches. Todd (1999) investigated the snails in 10 cm levels from
backhoe trenches from the Rough Green site (41TR162) across the river from the study
area and concluded that the environment had not changed appreciably from the Late
Archaic to the Late Prehistoric.

REVIEW OF WEST FORK FLOODPLAIN STUDIES
This chapter reviews archaeological investigations and soil studies in the floodplain of
the West Fork of the Trinity River between Fort Worth and Dallas over the past fifteen
years as they have a bearing upon the potential for finding buried prehistoric sites in the
study area along the West Fork. The presentation begins with the on the east side of Fort
Worth and ends just east of the study area. A prehistoric chronology, based on Prikryl
(1990), and an added historic period, for North Central Texas is presented below to
provide the reader with a time framework for the previous occupation discussed below.

Archaeological Investigations
The First Street Bridge site (41TR138) is located on the east side of Fort Worth (Largent,
Hunt and Peters 1991). The site consists of four concentrations of mussel shell and/or
burned rock on the south bank of the West Fork. The site deposit extends from one to
four meters below the surface in what the authors refer to as a deposit topped with the
West Fork paleosol. The site shows evidence of repeated occupation and inundation
which is common for sites on the West Fork, although few had been documented.
The River Bend site (41TR68) was located on the north side of the West Fork midway
between the Gateway section and the mouth of Village Creek. The site was tested in 1987
(Peter 1987) and is an example of a specialized foraging camp that was repeatedly
reoccupied between AD 850 and 1350. Low quantities of artifacts and virtually no
curated tools were found, although a wealth of burned rock and mussels shells were
present. Faunal remains included bones of deer, bison, rabbit, frog and turtle, but it was
concluded that the large mammals were butchered elsewhere (Peter 1987:32). Four rock
features were uncovered and radiocarbon dates of AD 1200+50 (Beta-22487) and AD
1330+100 (Beta-22488) were obtained from charcoal. Archaeomagnetism yielded dates
between AD 1350 and 1450.
AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd and Skinner 2002) conducted an archaeological
reconnaissance of four areas for the creation of wetland mitigation banks. Despite
intensive investigation, no cultural materials were found in the survey areas. One site,
however, that consisted of mussel shell, fire-cracked rock and bone that was
approximately 100 m long and 3 m below the surface, was found eroding from the bank
of the West Fork outside one of the survey areas.

River Legacy Park is a City of Arlington park that extends west from SH 157 (Collins
Street) almost to Greenbelt Road and is situated along the south side of the West Fork
channel. Ferring's survey of the park area (1994) located four prehistoric sites (41TR143146) exposed in the riverbank. He also described the Old Bridge Geologic Section from
the south bank of the West Fork to just east of the Rough Green site (Skinner and Caran
1997; Skinner, Caran and Trask 1999). The Old Bridge section includes four units (A-D).
Unit A consists of laterally accreted sands and silts and is related to the Sanger
Alloformation which is mid-Holocene in age (10,000 to 5,000 B.P.). A moderately
developed soil with a thick A-horizon is present at the top of Unit A. Unit B consists of
calcareous silts and clays with a prominent buried soil on top of the unit. This has been
termed the West Fork Paleosol. All of the recorded river bank sites are contained in this
unit from near its top to four meters below the surface. Unit C consists of discontinuously
exposed younger channel fills that are inset onto Units A and/or B. Unit D consists of
recent alluvium that covers all exposures of units B and C.
Two sites were discovered by AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd and Skinner 2003) during an
archaeological survey of the proposed expansion of MacArthur/Meyers Road north of US
30. Site 41DL426 was discovered in the West Fork’s floodplain and consists of mussel
shell, fire-cracked rock, bone and a charcoal and ash lens. Site 41DL425 was recorded on
the south bank of Bear Creek just north of the West Fork. The site contains at least two
shell lens overlying one another. Bone, charcoal, freshwater mussel shells, fire-cracked
rock, four pieces of lithic debris and an unusual deer antler tool were recovered during
test excavations.
Two prehistoric sites were located during the survey of a pipeline that crossed the
western part of River Legacy Park and continues north across the river before connecting
with a Trinity River Authority (TRA) pipeline (Skinner and Caran 1997). The Rough
Green site (41TR162) was discovered by shovel testing and was defined using augering
and backhoe trenching. The site is a massive shell midden that contains the only recorded
post hole along the West Fork. A deeply buried prehistoric site, 41TR164, was located by
backhoe trenching. Extensive testing at Rough Green (Skinner, Caran and Trask 1999)
found Late Archaic and Early Late Prehistoric occupations situated along the overbank
levee paralleling Walker Branch before the West Fork pirated the creek. It was concluded
that the primary function of the site was to collect bur oak acorns, although evidence of
hunting deer and other mammals and gathering freshwater mollusks was found in the site
deposit.
In 1994, the Archaeology Research Program (ARP) of Mercyhurst College recorded two
sites (41TR141 and 142) east of FM 157 in the West Fork floodplain (Shaunessy, Jurney
and Yedlowski 1994:1). Both sites are located along an old meander of the West Fork.
Testing at site 41TR141 yielded a Middle to Late Archaic Palmillas dart point, as well as
other artifactual and ecofactual materials. Subsequent testing of site 41TR142 and other
floodplain deposits for buried cultural horizons was conducted in 1996 by Geoarch
Consultants (Ferring and Byers 1996). Testing revealed the presence of an abandoned
meander belt system in the floodplain west of site 41TR142. The site was shown to
contain a preserved Late Archaic deposit over an area of about 20,500 square meters. The

floodplain site is considered to be the largest such site in the West Fork below Lake
Bridgeport (Ferring and Byers 1996:12). Mussel shell and animal bone are present in
addition to lithic artifacts and fire-cracked rock.
Testing of additional prehistoric sites (41TR167) was conducted by the Texas
Department of Transportation in conjunction with planning for a hiking and biking trail
between FM 157 and Highway 360 (Ellis 1998). The site is described as an example of a
"…zone containing a large number of 'localities' (Binford 1980) where small-scale,
limited-function resource exploitation events occurred (Ellis 1998:11)." The upper part of
the site sediment column is described as an A-horizon that has no clear evidence of the
West Fork Paleosol. A single radiocarbon date from the lower part of the occupation was
dated at A.D. 900 but was not associated with temporally diagnostic chipped stone tools.
Downstream and also on the north side of the West Fork, Geo-Marine, Inc. found a
buried prehistoric site reported as 41TR174 with the limits of a proposed pipeline route
designated as WF-11B by the Trinity River Authority (Burson, Hunt, Peter and
Shanabrook 2000). After a records search, the authors realized that their new site was
probably part of Ellis' site, 41TR167, which has been radiocarbon dated to about a
thousand years ago. At site 41TR174, cultural materials were found from 48 to 200 cm
below the surface. This zone was described as the West Fork Paleosol and a radiocarbon
date from near the base of the paleosol was dated A.D. 330+50 (Beta-131368).
AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd 2007) recorded probably the smallest site on the West Fork.
Site 41DL449 was located east of Roy Orr Boulevard and on the north bank of the West
Fork. The site consisted of seven mussel shells and two pieces of bone. The site was
located approximately 100 cm below surface (bs) and was removed during the deep
testing for a proposed pipeline route.
Previous Investigations
Sites and surveys discussed in this portion of the report are plotted on Figure 2.
Previously discussed sites and surveys are not repeated here. All non-referenced data is
from the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2008).
Geo-Marine, Inc. (Tiné 2002) investigated approximately 33 acres west of SH 157
(Collins Street) and north of the West Fork, and in 1990, CMTA investigated a small area
west of Collins Street and south of the railroad track. No archaeological sites were found
in either survey. Approximately 315 acres were surveyed for the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Texas Department Water Resources south of and adjacent to
Trammel Davis Road and west of and adjacent to Greenbelt Road in 1983 but no sites
were recorded. North of the study area, AR Consultants (Whorton and Skinner 1995)
investigated 275 acres for a golf course and sports complex. During the survey, the Tom
Coble homestead (41TR153) was recorded.

Previous investigations in the vicinity of the study area.

Sites 41TR139 and 140 west of Collins Street also were recorded during the Mercyhurst
archaeological survey (Shaunessy, Jurney and Yedlowski 1994). Site 41TR139 consists
of a surface lithic scatter that contained dart points, performs and bifaces that were
Archaic in age while site 41TR140 contained Archaic-aged flakes, dart points, bone and
mussel shell buried approximately a meter below the ground surface.
Sites 41TR70 and 41TR168 are located north of the northwestern portion of the study
area. Site 41TR70 consists of a surface probable base camp that ranges in age from the
Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric times although most of the artifacts found by local
collectors dated to the Late Archaic. The site is remarkable in that a large amount of
manos and metates were present. Site 41TR168 consists of a surficial lithic scatter with
fire-cracked rock and ground stone fragments. Its time frame is unknown.
Site 41TR161 is the only tested site in the study area (Skinner and Caran 1997:22-23).
The site was located 2.55 meters below the surface during trenching and consists of a
burned limestone and sandstone rock hearth. A block of earth was removed and screened
for artifacts but none were found. The site was found during the placement of four
trackhoe trenches along the northern border of the study area.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Regular flooding of the West Fork floodplain and the destruction of the floodplain and
the extensive quarrying of floodplain sediments eliminated historic occupation as a major
focus for this investigation. The following research questions were posed to be answered
at the time this project was begun.
-It was expected that sediments containing evidence of prehistoric
occupation would be found buried under the recent floodplain sediments
along the north bank of the West Fork and that the most recent of these
site deposits would be found more than a meter below the present surface
and associated with the top of the West Fork Paleosol.
-It was further expected that a deeper occupation would be found and
would provide evidence of earlier visitation to the drainage edge.
-It was further expected that sites would be located adjacent to the present
channels in settings including the floodplain and buried levees, all within
one hundred meters of the channels. While we recognize that most of this
study area is within the 100 meter limit, this question is relevant to all
research within the West Fork floodplain.
The West Fork of the Trinity River has been shown to have a good potential for
containing buried prehistoric archaeological resources (Ferring 1990). Ferring (1986:108)
states that sites with better preservation potentials are those that occur either above or
below the West Fork paleosol. Although lateral channel movement of the West Fork may
have destroyed some sites, this movement, along with siltation, is likely to have buried
prehistoric sites under the present surface.
The 105-acre study was investigated by both shovel and deep testing as recommended by
the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002). Shovel tests were supplemented by the use of
a 4-inch barrel auger. The clayey soils were not screened but were broken manually and
examined for cultural materials as were the pit walls. Backhoe trenches were excavated to
approximately 3 meters below the ground surface and were about 5 meters wide since
they were stepped according to OSHA standards. Soil profiles were described following
the procedures developed by Vogel (2002) and photographs were taken. The trenches
ranged from triangular to roughly square in shape to insure safety and this also allowed
the archaeologists to be able to view more area than a narrow trench would have
provided. Photographs of the study area were taken as were notes on the topography,
vegetation and other relevant data. We attempted to determine the boundary of site
41TR145 using deep testing.

RESULTS
This portion of the report is broken into several sections. The study area is described first
and is followed by a discussion of the survey. Conclusions derived from the survey end
the chapter. Shovel tests and backhoe trenches are described generally in the text, but
specific information is provided in Tables 1 and 2 and Appendix A. Backhoe and shovel
test locations are plotted on Figures 10 and 11
The Survey area
The general survey area consists of generally level to gently undulating terrain.
Vegetative zones ranged from grassland (Figure 3) to open forested areas to heavily
vegetated areas (Figure 4). Trees include oak, burr oak, hackberry, elm, cottonwood, salt
cedar and western soapberry. Understory vegetation includes grama grasses, johnson
grass, hog brush, prickly pear cactus, blood weed, saw greenbriar, grape vine and other
grass species. Ground visibility ranged from less than 5 to 100 percent and eye-height
visibility averaged 30 meters.

The Survey
The survey was broken into two sections: Walker Branch and west and east of Walker
Branch.
Walker Branch and west
The survey began at the City of Arlington/Fort Worth boundary where a pipeline route
crosses Walker Branch. The drainage has eroded extensively when compared to the 1959
USGS map and has been heavily disturbed.
Push piles (Figure 5), buried concrete blocks (Figure 6) and a concrete/gravel road
(Figure 7) are present along the northeast bank. An earthen berm (Figure 8) is located
along the southwest bank. Walker Branch is approximately 5 meters deep (Figure 9) and
at least 5 meters wide. Water ranging in depth from 0.25 to one meter deep was flowing
in a sandy clay substrate that contained limestone and hematite gravel bars. No knappable
lithic materials were found in the gravel bars and no buried cultural deposits were noted
in the vertical to sloping creek bank walls. Two mussel shells that possibly were subfossil
were found and these probably eroded from some location upstream.

Mr. Brett Lang is standing on the southwest bank of Walker Branch. The
photographer is standing in the channel.

Ten culturally sterile shovel tests (1-10) were excavated along Walker Branch (Figure
10). Two shovel tests (1 and 3) encountered sandstone bedrock at 29 and 11 cm bs,
respectively. Hematite sandstone outcrops to the north of the study area. Generally in
shovel tests 2, 4, 5 and 6, clay overlaid brown clay subsoil which in turn overlaid a brown
silty clay which may be the laminae zones found in the backhoe trenches along the West
Fork along the northeast bank. Shovel test was placed on the west bank of Walker Branch
where it flows into the West Fork and the shovel test uncovered 84 cm of sandy, loamy
clay. Shovel tests 8 to 10 were excavated along the creek’s southwest bank and clay
overlaid clay subsoil. Most likely, the upper soil horizon was removed during the
construction of the berm along the creek.
Three shovel tests (11-13) where placed along the West Fork west of Walker Branch
(Figure 10). It appears that a flood deposit overlies the grayish-brown topsoil in shovel
test 11 and a brown subsoil underlies the topsoil that ranges generally about 37 cm bs.
Shovel test 11 may have encountered the West Fork Paleosol due to the presence of
calcium carbonate. If so, it was the shallowest depth found during the survey.
After the shovel testing was completed, backhoe trench 25 (Appendix 1) was excavated
northwest of the concrete road (Figure 10). The results of the testing indicate that an
alluvial deposit overlies the laminated bank of Walker Branch. It appears, based upon the
banks and shovel tests, that laminae are present along the northeast and portions of the

southwest bank of the creek. The depositional process may also be a result of the West
Fork’s intrusion/confluence with Walker Branch.

plotted on a portion of the Hurst, Texas 7.5' USGS map.

To summarize, no cultural materials older than 50 years were found on the ground
surface, uncovered in 13 shovel tests and one backhoe trench or discovered in the creek
bank walls during the survey of Walker Branch and the West Fork west of Walker
Branch.
East of Walker Branch
Twenty-four backhoe trenches and fifteen shovel tests (14-28) were excavated east of
Walker Branch (Figure 11). Interestingly, backhoe trenches 1, 3-7, 23 and 24 mainly
encountered laminae (Figure 12) instead of the expected clay (Appendix 1). The presence
of the laminae in backhoe trenches 3-7 indicate a bend in the river that subsequently has
been filled by sediment. The West Fork Paleosol (Figure 13) was uncovered at an

average of approximately 90 cm bs along the west bank of the West Fork but at about 55
cm north of the bank. The total thickness of the palesol appears to be uniform
(approximately 60 cm) from the bank north although this can not be stated with surety
because the backhoe trenches north of the bank were excavated into the West Fork
Paleosol to determine if portions of an archaeological site were present. During the deep
testing, three prehistoric archaeological sites were recorded and are discussed below.
As previously mentioned, fifteen culturally sterile shovel tests (14-28) were excavated
along the north bank of the West Fork (Table 1). Only shovel test 21 was excavated to
total auger depth (174 cm) because it was placed in laminated sediments. None of the rest
of the shovel tests encountered the West Fork Paleosol due to the compactness and
hardness of the dry clay.

Prehistoric archaeological sites
During the deep testing along the north bank of the West Fork, three prehistoric sites
(41TR227, 228 and 229) containing freshwater mussel shell (Figure 14), some deer bone,
a turtle carapace fragment, dispersed charcoal and flecks of daub and fire-cracked rock
were recorded. The site locations are plotted on Figure 15. The sites were found either on
top or in the West Fork Paleosol.
Site 41TR227 (Figure 16) consists of multiple buried shell lens midden and hearths. The
uppermost portion of the site was discovered at 67 cm bs and the lowest was 117 cm bs.
Site 41TR228 (Figure 17) was uncovered in backhoe trench 18 at 122 cm bs and at 150
cm bs in backhoe trench 19 and consists of multiple buried shell lens middens and
hearths. Site 41TR229 (Figure 18) consists of a 10 cm thick shell lens midden that was
uncovered at 107 cm bs in backhoe trench 21.

Prehistoric sites recorded for this project. Shown on a portion of the
Euless 7.5' USGS map.

Except for site 41TR229, representative freshwater mussel valves and bone were
collected. Recovered artifacts consist of a Plectomerus dombeyanus left valve and 12 left
and 8 right Fusconaia flava valves from site 41TR229 at 107 cm bs in backhoe trench 21.
From site 41TR 228, 2 bone fragments (probably deer) and 3 right and 1 left Fusconaia
flava valves, a left valve from an Amblema plicata and a right valve from a Lampsilis
hdyiana were collected. Charcoal was collected from backhoe trench 9 in site 41TR227 at
113 cm bs and a Terrapene carapace at 126 cm bs. Fifty freshwater mussel shells were
collected from backhoe trench 9 at 82 cm bs which constitute 6 species. The species and
valve count are: Amblema plicata (6 right, 3 left), Obliqueria reflexa (1 right), Lampsilis
hydiana (4 left), Tritogonia verrucosa (2 right, 1 left), Plectomerus dombeyanus (5 left, 5
right) and Fusconaia flava (8 left and 14 right). These freshwater mussel species are
present in numerous archaeological sites along the West Fork. Samples of charcoal at 113
cm bs and shell at 82cm bs from Trench 9 were submitted to Beta-Analytic for AMS
dating. The shell at 82 cm dated from 1520 to 1330 BP which is from AD 430 to 620
(Beta 251819) and the charcoal dated to BP 920 to 730 which is from AD 1030 to 1220
(Beta 251820).

We believe that the radiocarbon date for the shell is not correct because it is higher in the
section and has an older date than that of the date for the charcoal which we accept. The
sample must have been contaminated.

Conclusions
As expected, buried prehistoric sites were discovered during the deep testing along the
West Fork. The absence of a prehistoric archaeological site along Walker Branch near the
West Fork may be a result of the area filling with alluvium as indicated in the profiles of
backhoe trenches 24 and 25. The Rough Green site (41TR162) which was found south of
the West Fork and adjacent to Walker Branch was found in a sand/sandy loam (Skinner
et al. 1999:24) which was not found in the shovel tests along Walker Branch.
Interestingly, the West Fork Paleosol appears to be absent in Trackhoe trenches 1 and 4
as described by Caran (Skinner and Caran 1997:20, 23). The upward fining sequences
probably are analogous to the laminae recorded in the backhoe trenches close to the
trackhoe locations.
Site 41TR145 was not located during the deep testing. Backhoe trenches 3 through 7
were placed in the area where the site was placed on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas.
Also, the bank of the river was walked in the vicinity of the site and no cultural materials

were seen eroding out. The site may have eroded away due to flooding of the river over
time or may have been poorly located.
Sites 41TR227, 228 and 229 are similar to site 41TR167 which Ellis (1998) recorded
southeast of the study area. Ellis (1998:4-5) characterized 41TR167 as being a series of
shell lens and hearths “distributed in widely variable and horizontal densities” and this
description fits the sites recorded during this survey. Like site 41TR167, our sites
contained many human introduced artifacts such as shell, bone and fire-cracked rock;
however, site 41TR167 contained a few human made artifacts whereas none were found
during our survey.
The date from 113 cm in Backhoe trench 5 ranges from AD 1030 to 1220 (BP920 to 730)
and this falls within the range of radiocarbon dates for the West Fork Paleosol as shown
in Table 2 (Todd and Skinner 2003:.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the results of the archaeological survey, we believe that sites 41TR227, 228
and 229 may be eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places since
their extent and content is not totally known. Should future excavation occur in the area,
these sites should be investigated further.
However, since the City of Arlington and Republic Waste Services of Texas have
maintained that there are no plans to excavate in the study area in the future, we make no
other recommendations.
