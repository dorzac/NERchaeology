EXCAVATIONS AT THE COLLINS SITE,
TRAVIS COUNTY, TEXAS
DEEANNSUHM
INTRODUCTION
The Collins Site is situated on the south bank of Onion
Creek, approximately six miles south of Austin. It was
located early in the fall of 1953 by students from the Department of Anthropology, The University of Texas. Evidence of occupation was easily recognized in several deep
gullies eroded into the site, exposing artifacts, hearthstones,
flint chips and bone fragments. A test pit confirmed these
indications and made it apparent that controlled excavation
would produce useful data concerning aboriginal habitation
of the area.
Excavation of the Collins Site was undertaken as a student
project, under the supervision of students who had had
previous field experience. In order to fit academic schedules, digging was limited to Sundays, from October 1953 to
May 1954, with a crew of six to ten members. By such an
undertaking the students were able to obtain significant
archeological information and, at the same time, acquaint
themselves with archeological field techniques.
The writer would like to acknowledge the cooperation of
Walter Collins, the land owner, and A. Lawson Boothe,
owner of the adjacent property; to credit the enthusiasm
shown by all the students comprising the crew: Joan Ablon,
Nelda Cade, Dale Exley, Ann Pescor Leonard, Jerry Reeves,
William E. Stanton, Rudy Troike, Nancy Patterson Troike,
and Edwin Williams; and to thank the Department of Anthropology for providing equipment for excavation and laboratory facilities for analysis of the artifacts. The opportunity to examine and to photograph artifacts collected from
the site by William E. Stanton is also appreciated. Finally,
the encouragement and helpful advice so freely given by
Edward B. Jelks of the National Park Service, and T. N.
Campbell and Alex D. Krieger of The University of Texas,
Department of Anthropology, have done much to make this
report possible.

GEOLOGY AND NATURAL SETTING
The site is buried in the third terrace (second terrace
above the floodplain) of Onion Creek, about ten miles above
the confluence of the creek and the Colorado River. In that
vicinity the creek is deeply entrenched into a Cretaceous
limestone formation, exposing vertical bluffs on both sides
of the valley. The subsequent stream deposition and erosion
cycles are represented by the terraces.
The third terrace (T-3) is approximately 46 feet above
the present creek channel. It is about 200 feet across the
northern edge of T -3 to the base of the limestone bluff.
The second terrace (T-2) is considerably smaller, only 15
to 20 feet across, and is 16 to 18 feet above the creek bed.
Smallest and most recent of the terraces (T-1) is the very
narrow floodplain bordering the edge of Onion Creek; it is
only several feet above the stream.
The deep gullies cutting into the terraces have exposed a
cross-section of the valley fill. Resting on top of the limestone bedrock is a greenish material of igneous origin. Although a large portion of this deposit has eroded away, it
outcrops at various points along the banks of Onion Creek.
This material, loosely referred to as serpentine, is a volcanic ash composed largely of montmorillonite clay (Weiss
and Clabaugh, 1955, pp. 136-48) . It emanated from a series
of sea-floor eruptions which occurred during late Cretaceous
times (ibid., pp. 136-7). The hard basaltic core of one of
these volcanoes, located several miles southeast of the site,
is known as Pilot Knob.
After the eruption, the volcanic ash was buried by further
accumulations of limestone. Subsequent erosion by Onion
Creek has cut through the upper limestone deposit and
much of the igneous material. In places the stream is flowing across limestone underlying the volcanic debris.
A tightly consolidated gravel, several feet
lies above the igneous deposit. The remainder
fill consists of calcareous silts which can be
two strata. The uppermost stratum (II), 4

in thickness,
of the valley
divided into
to 5 feet in

Excavations at the Collins Site, Travis County, Texas

thickness, is a black, clay soil containing a great deal of
decayed organic matter. The lower constituent (Stratum I)
is of a very similar composition, but it is buff in color and
has very little humus. 1 Cultural material extended well into
Stratum I, but greatly decreased in frequency at about 6
feet below the surface. There was no clear demarcation
between these two strata.
The upland area was a rolling grassland less than a century ago and probably supported fairly large herds of grazing animals. Today mesquite, scrub oak and prickly pear
grow along the rim of the valley, while hackberry, oak,
cottonwood and cypress border the creek. No charred vegetable remains were recovered during excavation, though the
durable hackberry seed was found extending to a depth of
about 5 feet. Present-day fauna consists largely of small
mammals, particularly rabbit, armadillo, skunk, squirrel and
opossum. Other animals identified as historically present
include deer, bison, raccoon, fox, beaver and coyote. Deer
and bison were the most important of the animals hunted,
judging by the bone fragments recovered.
About 200 yards east of the site is a large spring which
has continued to flow in spite of low rainfall in recent
years. The abundance of water coupled with a food supply
which could readily have been obtained from game animals,
turtles, fresh-water mussels, fishes, and various wild plant
products must have been enticing features to aboriginal
groups. In addition, innumerable flint nodules can be found
in the stream bed and above the bluffs, and the shallow
rock shelters which occur in the limestone bluffs would
have afforded protection during bad weather. One of these
shelters, the Smith Site, about a quarter of a mile upstream
from the Collins Site was excavated by University of Texas
students in 1954-5 (Anonymous, 1954; Suhm, 1955).
1. Soil samples were analyzed by the Bureau of Economic Geology, The University of Texas.

METHOD OF CONTROL AND EXCAVATION
A grid system consisting of 5 foot squares was laid out
on approximately the central portion of the site (Fig. 1) .
Coordinates going north-south were designated by capital
letters (A, B, etc.), while those running east-west were
labeled by numbers (1, 2, etc.). Any 5 foot square excavated outside the grid was called a "test pit." The test
pits were differentiated by the use of capital letters, such
as Test Pit A, Test Pit B, etc. When test pits were adjacent
to one another they were designated with Roman numerals,
such as Test Pit C I, C II, etc.
A datum point 42 inches above the ground level was established on a small oak tree near the grid. Measurements
were taken from the projected datum plane to the point
where the datum stake (i. e., the stake from which the levels
were measured) intersected the ground surface. However,
since there was relatively little variation in the surface
contour, all depth measurements in the field notes and those
presented herein were made from the surface of the highest
corner of the square (the datum stake) .
Since it was not feasible to excavate the site in cultural
or geological zones, each square was dug by arbitrary 6
inch levels. All material was sifted through a quarter-inch
mesh screen and the artifacts and identifiable bone fragments collected from each 6 inch level were placed in a paper
bag and later catalogued. Snail shells, charred bone and
charcoal suitable for radiocarbon dating were also collected
from many levels.
A total of 30 squares was excavated; nine of these were
dug to a depth of 12 inches, four to 18 inches, seven to 24
inches, one to 30 inches, four to 36 inches, one to 42, 54, 60,
66 and 88 inches respectively. The areal extent of occupation, outlined in Figure 1, was approximately 480 feet long
and 99 feet wide. Only the central portion of this area
seemed to have been intensively occupied. The greatest
depth of occupation is not known as excavations did not
exceed 88 inches. So few artifacts were found in the three

lowest levels that it was deemed more practical to concentrate on the upper 5 feet. However, a careful examination of the deep gullies seemed to indicate that occupation
did not extend much beyond 8 or 9 feet.
Hearths consisting of fire-cracked limestone and charcoal
were very common. These fire areas occurred at all levels,
but were more frequent in depth below 12 inches. For the
most part, the hearthstones were scattered and there was no
consistent arrangement. Aside from the hearths no features
were recorded. Pits, postholes, etc., would have been very
difficult to detect because of the lack of variation in most
of the alluvium. No burials were found, but the proximal
end of a human femur occurred in Test Pit D. Careful
searching in that vicinity failed to uncover other human
bones.
ANALYSIS OF ARTIFACTS
Shortly after excavations had begun it was apparent that
two components were present at the site. The upper one
was represented by the Central Texas Aspect and was recognized primarily by small, thin arrow points and pottery.
The lower cultural member was the Edwards Plateau Aspect, identified by many dart point types and other lithic
implements. Unfortunately for analysis, the two were not
separated in the upper 18 inches of the site. In some cases,
it was difficult to associate artifacts with one or the other
aspect. However, arrow points and pottery did not extend
below a depth of 18 inches; this, combined with data from
other sites where the distinctions are clearer, forms the
basis for recognition of the two cultural units.
Pottery and projectile points were grouped according to
types presented in "An Introductory Handbook of Texas
Archeology" (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954). For definition of other classes of artifacts described below, see the
glossary in that volume.

finds made at the Collins Site. All sherds were from the
three upper 6 inch zones. Pottery consistently occurs in the
Central Texas Aspect, although usually in small quantities.
It is typically plain, varying considerably in color and, to
a much lesser extent, in t ex ture. The few decor ated sherds
reported (J ackson, 1938, pp. 108-112; Krieger 1946 p. 166;
Miller and Jelks, 1952, p. 185; Jelks, 1953, pp. 205-6) have
been identified as tr ade items from Caddoan gr oups in east
Texas.
Two hundred and thir ty-four sherds from the Collins Site
ar e classified as Leon Plain (Krieger, 1946, p . 166; Suhm ,
Krieger and J elks, 1954, pp . 286-8, P late 74, A -E). These
potter y fragm en ts r epresent an estimated th ree to five v essels; howev er all sherds are small and very little can be
determined of vessel shapes. Th e maj ority are thin, 2 to 4
mm. in thickness, hard and compact in texture, and tempered with finely pulv erized bone. Ten sh erds (Plate 2,
MM) are notably thicker, 6 to 10 mm., and somewhat coarser
in texture, but are included in Leon Plain . Interior surfaces
of all sherds are well-smoothed ; the exter ior surfaces are
polished, sometimes having a glossy fin ish. Sherds grade in
color from reddish , buff, gray-brown, to black; cores are
consistently dark. There are no indications of a red wash
or slip and all variations in color are attributable to firing
conditions. Two vessels have appendages consisting of a
loop handle (Plate 2, HH) and a small node (Plate 2, KK) .
Both appendages are just below the rim and presumably
there were two handles on the one vessel, while the other
had two or more nodes.
'
Decorated sherds number 615, representing at least eight
vessels. Two small sherds, probably from one vessel, have
incised designs (Plate 2, LL); otherwise they closely resemble Leon Plain. These fragments are so small that it is
difficult to determine the exact placement of the decoration.
Presumably most of the body was plain and undoubtedly
a portion of this vessel was tabulated with Leon Plain. Judging from what little was recovered, the design consists of
short, hachured lines, combined-perhaps enclosed-by a

16

Texas Archeological Society

horizontal line. The horizontal line below (?) the hachuring
indents to form a small square. Although based on extremely scanty data, the incising is reminiscent of designs on
coastal pottery (see Rockport Incised and Goose Greek Incised in Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, pp. 380, 385 and
Plate 72).
The majority of the potsherds, estimated to belong to
seven vessels, had brushed decoration, often combined with
rows of punctates made around some parts of the rim.
These vessels could not be identified as any established
type, but it is believed that they are distinctive enough to
designate as a provisional new type - Boothe Brushed
(Plates 1, A-I and 2, II, JJ). The following definition is
based entirely on pottery found at the Collins Site and is
expected to be modified as larger samples are studied. The
most complete vessel (Plate 1, G) differed from the others
in temper, absence of punctates and having more random
and deeper striations; however it is tentatively included
in this type.
PASTE
Method of manufacture: Probably coiled.
Temper: Pulverized bone; one vessel (Plate 1, G) has no
visible tempering agent.
Texture: Fine to fairly coarse, but in all instances hard
and does not crumble.
Color: Interior and exterior surfaces gray, grayish- buff,
almost black, and yellowish-red. Considerable mottling,
sometimes producing striking variation in color on a
single vessel. Cores uniformly gray.
Surface finish: Exterior covered with brushing, usually
combined with punctates; inside very well-smoothed,
rarely polished.
FORM
Wall thickness: 3 to 7 mm.; most are thin, 4 to 5 mm.
Lip: Straight and flat (Â·P late 2, II) ; one convex and
turned outward (Plate 2, JJ) .
Base: Only one definite base could be reconstructed, a
thick flat disk to which the wall was attached (Plate 1,
G) . The failure to recognize other basal sherds suggests

that some may have been gently convex and not much
thicker than the vessel walls. They may have been classified as body sherds.
Vessel shape and size: All appear to have been jars,
probably about 18 to 25 em. in height with oral diameter
14 to 18 em. High rims flare gently outward and meet
the body at a slight angle (Plate 1, A, C). Jars have no
clear demarcation between the rim and body (Plate 1,
G); their bodies usually bulge slightly below the rim or
toward the lower portion.
DECORATION
Treatment: Brushing, punctating and, less often, applique.
Design: Bodies covered with horizontal, vertical, or, less
frequently, random striations; usually they are neat and
closelv spaced (Plate 1, A, C). Rims are usually brushed
vertically or horizontally. All but one vessel (Plate 1,
G) combine punctates with brushing. At least three
have one to two rows of punctates at the juncture of
body and rim (Plate 1, A-C, E, I); several have a row of
punctates just below the rim (Plate 1, D, H). Punctates
appear to have been made with blunt tools. Occasionally vertical fillets appear on the vessel bodies, just below neck punctates (Plate 1, E, F); rarely there are
small nodes (number uncertain) just below the lip
(Plate 1, H).
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
At present known only as a minor type of the Central
Texas Aspect. Similarity in paste suggests that it is linked
with Leon Plain.
Brushed decoration sometimes combined with punctates
and applique is a common feature of Fulton Aspect
utility pottery in east Texas. Closest similarities are
with Bullard Brushed of the Frankston and Titus Foci
(Krieger, 1946; Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, pp. 2523, Plate 9), but Boothe Brushed differs considerably in
paste and somewhat in vessel shape, size, and mode of
brushing. It is not Caddoan trade ware and probably
was made at the Collins Site.
DISTRIBUTION
Definitely present only at Collins Site so far as known. A
vessel from Kincaid Site, Uvalde County, is similar to
the large jar in Plate 1, G (T. N. Campbell, personal
communication). Some brushed sherds from the Belton
Reservoir sites (Miller and Jelks, 1952, Tables 1 to 4)

20

were examined by the writer. A few resemble Boothe
Brushed but the majority are more like the brushed
Caddoan trade sherds foun d in Central Texas, like Bullard Brushed.

CHIPPED STONE IMPLEMENTS

Arrow Points
Arrow points, totaling 70 specimens, were found on the
surface and to a depth of 18 inches. For a detailed stratigraphic distribution see chart below; for illustrations of
various types see Plate 2, AA-GG.

Scallorn is the most common type, being represented by
21 points. It occurred most frequently in the six to twelve
inch zone; however over half of all the arrow points from
the site were from this depth and the concentration of Seallorn in this zone does not seem significant. The majority of
the points are corner-notched with prominent, often barbed
shoulders and strongly expanding stems. Bases vary from
straight, gently concave, to convex. Only one point (Plate
2, F) is definitely side-notched. As a group the Scallorn
points are well-made, with fine marginal chipping which
often produced tiny serrations.
Most numerous of the triangular arrow points is Fresno,
which consists of eight specimens. Seven have concave
bases; the eighth has a gently convex base. Several are
very small, 1 to 1.5 em. in length, while the largest is 3 em.
long. The blade of one point (Plate 2, L) is serrated.
One triangular point is classified as Starr because of its
three concave edges. It was the only projectile point found
in Test Pit D, at the western extremity of the site. Another
triangular arrow-point type, Young, is represented by six
specimens. These range in workmanship from poorly-made,
simply trimmed flakes, to fairly well-chipped points. They
are distinguished from Fresno points by their larger size,
shape and somewhat poorer chipping. Two Young points
(Plate 2, CC, DD) have faint suggestions of a stem, but

they are not definite enough to be classified as Cliffton
points.
Most of the eight Perdiz points are thin, crudely-chipped
flakes. It is important to note-in view of the two recent
reports of the superposition of Perdiz over Scallorn (Jelks,
1953; Anonymous, 1954}-that there was no stratigraphic
separation of Perdiz and Scallorn points here. In several
squares they were found within the same six-inch level.
However, the difference in frequency (21 Scallorn as opposed to 8 Perdiz ) possibly has chronological implications.
Perhaps Perdiz points were just being introduced into the
area and had not become a popular style. It is also possible
that the association of Perdiz points with ScaHorn points is
due to a slow rate of alluvial deposition combined with
mechanical disturbances that occurred during occupation ot
the site by aboriginal groups. There may be some significance in the absence of Cliffton points which consistently occur at sites where Perdiz is well represented.
A small point having a triangular blade and slender rectangular stem with shallow V-shaped basal notch is identified as Cuney (Plate 2, V) . Cuney is more common in central-east Texas, where it appears primarily in historic context.

Alba, represented by two specimens, is the only other
arrow-point type recognized. Both have rectangular stems
and straight blade edges. Concave blade edges are more
typical of east Texas Alba points, whereas this feature is
rare or absent in central Texas.
The remaining arrow points consist of 18 fragments too
incomplete for identification and five points which could
not be classified. Three of the unclassified points (Plate 2,
X-Z) have slightly expanding stems with convex bases and
blade edges that vary from straight, to convex, and concave. In some respects they are reminiscent of both Scallorn
and Alba, but to include them with either of these types
would obscure their distinctiveness. Their recognition as a

24

Texas A rcheological Society

separate type or extreme variant of Scallorn or Alba should
depend upon additional distributional data.
One of the remaining untyped specimens is a small point
with a slightly expanding, deeply bifurcated stem (Plate 2,
W). A similar specimen is illustrated by Huskey (1935,
Plate 15, second from the right). Though somewhat similar
to Cuney, it differs enough to make identification with that
type uncertain. The fifth unclassified point (Plate 2, AA),
a slender triangular specimen, is notably longer than the
other arrow points, but it is light and does not fit into the
dart-point category. The base is slightly concave, somewhat reminiscent-probably fortuitously-of Maud points in
east Texas.

Dart Points
A total of 287 dart points was recovered; of these 60 are
too fragmentary for classification and seven cannot be assigned to any recognized type. The remaining 220 are identified as belonging to 24 types.

ology. Although the range of variation is discussed and
illustrated in that publication, there are several projectile
point features and type groupings which should be elaborated before considering the distributional data.
Ensor, represented by the largest number of identifiable
points (39), includes all side-notched specimens from this
site which have lateral edges of the stem approximately in
line with the blade edges. About a third of the Ensor points
have concave bases, a greater frequency than has been noted
elsewhere (Miller and Jelks, 1952, p. 172; Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks, 1954, pp. 422-3, Plate 90).
Approximately a third of the 17 Darl points have alternately beveled blade edges; only one has the lateral edges
of the stem smoothed. Beveling of the blade also occurs on
four of the six Tortugas points, four of the 39 Ensor points,
one of the 10 Lange points, one of the 14 Bulverde points, and
one of the nine Nolan points.
The five specimens recognized as Pandora points (Plate 4,
P, Q) overlap with the knives, but are narrower and lighter
than knives. The same possibility may apply to the six
Kinney points (Plate 4, W, AA) and two Refugio points
(Plate 4, J, K). There are resemblances between the five
Edgewood points (Plate 3, F, G) and the single Uvalde point
(Plate 3, H), but Uvalde has a deeper basal notch, the stem
is less expanding, and it is larger (the illustrated point appears to have been reworked). The point illustrated in
Plate 3, AA is identified as Pedernales despite the shallow
base notch. All but one of the other 32 Pedernales points
have deep basal notches (Plate 3, Z, BB). The Palmillas
point (Plate 4, G) is distinguished from the four Williams
points (Plate 4, H, I) principally by its smaller size. One
of the 14 points identified as Bulverde (Plate 4, T) has an
exceptionally long stem, but is probably a variant of that
type.
A point found in one of the gullies has a number of the
characteristics of the Scottsbluff type - parallel flaking,
thick cross-section, slightly off-set stem, and faint smoothing

28

along lateral edges of the stem. However, several of these
features are not pronounced enough to make the identification certain. If this is an early type point, it is the only one
found at the site (Plate 4, CC) .
The seven unclassified points include t w o specimens
(Plate 4, V, X) which are short and broad with strongly
expanding stems and deeply concave bases. They came from
the surface, 6 to 12 and 18 to 24 inch levels. The remaining
untyped specimens are two points (Plate 4, Y, Z) which have
long and narrow stems, triangular blades, and weak shoulders (from 18-24 and 30-36 inch levels respectively); one
long and narrow triangular point (Plate 4, BB) from the
18-24 inch levels has slight smoothing along the lateral edges;
and one small corner-notched point (Plate 4, F) has long
barbs and expanded, straight-based stem (from 12 to 18 inch
level).
In examining the above frequencies and stratigraphic data,
it should be recalled that only five of the 30 squares were
excavated to a depth exceeding thirty-six inches. This will
account, in part, for the greater number of points in the
upper six zones. However, it was apparent in the field that
as digging proceeded into the deeper levels there was a
notable decrease in cultural material. As another word of
caution, it should be emphasized that the six-inch levels are
arbitrary and that within these zones the position of a point
was not recorded. And, finally , as many types are sparsely
represented, any conclusions are very tentative.
All types listed here have been noted elsewhere (Suhm,
Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, p. 108) as occurring in the Edwards
Plateau Aspect. The frequency tabulation is about what one
would expect, with the possible exception of Williams, Marshall, and Uvalde which are not common.

This stratigraphic position of DarL and Ensor confirms
earlier suspicions (Miller and Jelks, 1952, p. 172) of late
Edwards Plateau and early Central Texas Aspect affiliations. This may not apply to Ellis nor Edgewood as has been
suggested (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, p . 108).
In even a cursory examination of the chart it is apparent
that the greatest range of dart styles occur within the upper
twenty-four inches. Some forms such as Pandora, AbasoLo,
Frio, and Kinney may not have spread into the Austin vicinity until late Edwards Plateau Aspect time, being found
more often in sites to the west and southwest of this area.
Gradual accretions to the dart-point styles, coupled with a
lingering on of other forms such as Pedernales, Bulverde,
and Nolan would certainly augment the variety of forms .
An alternative speculation is that the site, in the later phases
of its occupation, was frequented more often by different
groups. This latter explanation, however, assumes vague
and flexible or frequently changing territorial boundariessomewhat contrary to the situation usually noted for hunting and gathering peoples on the ethnological level.
It is possible to distinguish three levels based upon the
distribution of dart-point types. The lowest levels are those
below 36 inches, represented primarily by Pedernales, Bulverde, and Nolan points. The middle level, 18 to 36 inches,
marks the appearance of a number of new types at the site,
including Ensor, Darl, Marco s, William s, Marshall, Edgewood, and several others. The uppermost level, surface to
18 inches, is the zone of mixture of dart points, arrow points,
and pottery. This last zone may indicate a survival of most
dart-point types into the early phases of the Central Texas
Aspect. Again, it cannot be emphasized too strongly that the
above zoning is based upon a small number of specimens. At
best, the distributions offer some suggestions as to the
relative chronology of dart-point types.

Other attempts to divide the Edwards Plateau Aspect into
levels or smaller cultural units (phases or foci) include the
schemes of Pearce (1932, p. 49) , Sayles (1935) , Huskey (1935,

p. 108), and Kelley (1947a, 1947b). These breakdowns, like
the one presented above, are based almost entirely upon
stratigraphic and/or areal distributions of dart-point types.
The data at the Collins Site correspond most closely with
Pearce's bottom, middle and upper zones; whereas there
was relatively little evidence to support the other three
classifications.

Knives
The 186 knives are represented principally by tip and
medial fragments too incomplete for classification. However, 71 can be grouped according to shape.
Oval-shaped knives (Plate 5, F, G, J), ranging in length
from 6.5 to 12 em. and 3.5 to 6.5 em. in width, constitute the
largest category (27 specimens). Bases are slightly to
strongly convex. Nineteen knives have roughly parallel
blade edges with bases straight, concave, or convex (Plate
5, D, I). They measure 7.5 to 12 em. in length and 3.5 to
5 em. in width. Triangular forms (Plate 5, L, M) consist
of 13 specimens and are the third most frequent group.
Bases are concave or convex, but not straight. One specimen
(Plate 5, L), of exceptional workmanship, has serrations
along the blade edges and the base. It is the only knife
that may be associated exclusively with the Central Texas
Aspect.
Minor forms include five lanceolate knives (Plate 5, E),
a diamond-shaped knife having alternate bevels at one end
(Plate 5, A), two double-pointed knives (Plate 5, K), one
corner-tang knife (Plate 5, H), three assymetrical forms
(Plate 5, C, N), and two stemmed knives (Plate 5, B).
Both stemmed knives bear some resemblance to Pedernales
points, but the stems are notably shorter and the overall
dimensions, much larger. The corner-tang knife, found on
the surface, appears to be a reworked specimen, possibly
made from a larger knife.
With the exception m entioned above, all knife forms found
in place occurred in the lower levels in Edwards Plateau

34

Texas Archeological Society

Aspect context. In addition, most continued into the upper
zones (e. g., above 18 inches) with little change in frequency.
The mixture of Edwards Plateau and Central Texas Aspects
in the upper levels makes it difficult to determine the affiliations of the knives from these zones. Probably most continued to be used by people of the Central Texas Aspect,
but this can be answered better by data from less mixed
sites.
Scrapers

Sixty-six plano-convex implements are classified as scrapers. These are further grouped into snub-nosed, large end
and/or side scrapers, concave scrapers, and turtle-backed,
depending upon the size, position of the scraping edge and
cross-section.
The 21 snub-nosed scrapers were made from relatively
thin, sometimes curved flakes and have blunt, well-made
bits. With one exception, chipping is confined to the bits
and lateral edges, and in all instances the bit is convex.
Marginal retouching occurs on the lateral edges of all specimens and evidently was to form cutting or scraping edges,
rather than to shape the body of the scraper.
On the basis of size the snub-nosed scrapers fall into two
well-defined categories. One group (Plate 6, F, G) consists
of 14 scrapers which are small, ranging from 4.5 to 5.5 em.
in length, .5 to 1.5 em. in thickness (at the bit end), and 3
to 5 em. in width. The remaining five (Plate 6, M, N) measure 7 to 10 em. in length, 1 to 1.5 em. in thickness (at bit
end), and 4.5 to 6 em. in width. There was no significant
difference in the distribution of these two groups.
All but two of the snub-nosed scrapers were found with
pottery and thus appear to belong primarily to the Central
Texas Aspect occupation. However, a small and a large one
occurred below the pottery and arrow-point zone, in association with Edwards Plateau artifacts. There were no indications of any mixture and all evidence suggests that snubnosed scrapers appeared in Central Texas before pottery

and arrow points, attaining greatest popularity in the Central Texas Aspect.
Forty-one of the scrapers can be characterized as large
and poorly made with unifacial chipping along one or more
edges (Plate 7, H, I, 0). Outline shapes vary from disc to
oval and to rectangular. Scraping edges in a few instances
are quite sinuous and in almost all cases a portion of the
crusted surface of the flint nodule is visible. Positions of
the scraping edges are variable: 15 are on the end; four
combine end and one lateral edge; five are chipped along
one end and both sides; seven have scraping edges along
both sides; and 10 are chipped along one side. These large
scrapers were more common in the deeper levels, particularly between 24 and 36 inches, but continued into the
upper zones.
Only three concave scrapers or spokeshaves (Plate 6, B,
I), one from the surface and the other two from Edwards
Plateau Aspect context, were found at the Collins Site. One
had a small graver point on the edge opposite the concavity
(Plate 6, B).
Two scrapers are classified as "turtle-backed" because of a
high medial ridge which tapers toward the proximal end.
Both are well-made and roughly oval in outline. The bluntness of the distal ends suggests that they may be merely
well-made end scrapers, but they stand out in workmanship
and in shape. The distal ends and both lateral edges show
some evidence of use. Both are from the upper levels, associated with pottery.
Gouges
This class of chipped-stone implements numbering 15
specimens, overlaps the end scrapers, but is set apart primarily because of specialized bits which possibly indicate
uses different from end scrapers.
Ten of the gouges fall within the range of the Clear Fork
type, first described by Ray (1929, 1938). Four of these are
unifacially chipped and triangular to almost rectangular in

38

Texas Archeological Society

shape, with straight to slightly convex bits (Plate 7, A-C) .
Three are bifacially chipped, triangular in shape and have
concave bits (Plate 7, D-E) . One of the triangular planoconvex gouges is considerably narrower than the others, but
it has all the other characteristics of the Clear Fork gouge
(Plate 7, B) . The remaining three gouges consist of proximal fragments . Considerable variation is allowed in the
Clear Fork gouge, as finer divisions are difficult to make
without more descriptive and distributional data than are
available at present.
Stratigraphic positions of the Clear Fork gouges were
variable: two of the plano-convex ones occurred in the 54
to 66 inch zone and were among the most deeply buried
artifacts excavated. The other gouges were found within
and below the pottery and arrow-point level. However, the
Clear Fork gouges appear to be associated primarily with
the Edwards Plateau Aspect.
The other five gouges, all found between 18 and 36 inches,
differ considerably from the Clear Fork series. They are
oblong to almost rectangular in shape (5.5 to 10 em. long,
3 to 6 em. at the mid-section, and 1.5 to 3.4 em. in maximum
thickness), bi-convex, and have bits which are transverse
to the blade at a slight angle (Plate 7, F -G) . In longitudinal
section they resemble an irregularly-shaped lens which has
been severed diagonally across one end. The bits, which
are the most distinctive feature, appear to have been well
adapted for hollowing or scooping. Only one of these gouges
has a bit at both ends.
Although based on a small sample, the latter five gouges
were found only in the upper Edwards Plateau levels, below
pottery. The Clear Fork type, however, was found in the
deeper zones, continuing with a slight decrease in number
into the upper zones. These data suggest that the Clear
Fork gouge is the earlier of the two, at least in the Austin
vicinity, but this should be checked further at sites where
both are present in larger numbers.

Gravers
Chipped-stone implements with short, beak-like projections are classified as gravers (Plate 6, A-C). The 21 from
the Collins Site were made from large to small irregularlyshaped flakes, with a minimum amount of marginal retouching to shape the graver point. Frequently a graver and
scraper were combined on one specimen (Plate 6, B). Only
one has two graver points.
Most of the projections are too short for boring purposes,
but are well suited for cutting or incising material such as
bone, shell, or pottery. Gravers occurred from the surface
to a depth of 60 inches with no particular concentration in
any zone.
Utilized Flakes
Irregularly-shaped flakes with marginal retouching along
one or more edges have been referred to variously as flake
scrapers, utilized flakes , and retouched flakes. They are
common in many archeological sites and probably constitute
one of the simplest and most useful stone tools. The retouched edges are serviceable for many cutting and scraping
purposes. At the Collins Site 111 utilized flakes were found
(Plate 6, D, E) , represented with about equal frequency
in all levels.
Drills
The only complete drill was a large specimen, 10 em. long,
possibly rechipped from a slender, lanceolate-shaped knife
(Plate 6, J) . The other drills consist of five shaft fragments,
two of which are alternately beveled. None was found below
a depth of 24 inches. One of these fragments (Plate 6, L) ,
from the top 6 inch level, appeared to be a portion of a
small flake drill, characteristic of the Central Texas Aspect.
Heavy Blades
Of the 96 bifacially-chipped blades from the site, 31 are
fragments. Those complete or nearly so vary mainly in
shape, being grouped into: oval (32) , rectangular or parallel-

42

Texas Archeological Society

sided (22), circular (5), triangular (4 specimens-3 with
convex bases, the other concave), and irregular (2). Otherwise, the blades are similar in being crudely chipped, often
retaining a portion of the flint nodule crust, thick and relatively large. They range in length from 6 to 16 em., in width
from 4 to 11 em., and in thickness from 1.5 to 5 em. Blades
of all shapes occurred in all layers, although approximately
60 per cent of them were from unmixed Edwards Plateau
Aspect levels.
These tools are sometimes referred to as axes, as they are
suitable for chopping. Although the edges of many are
badly battered as one would expect of an axe, a number
evidence very little wear. Some probably served as heavy
knives, but the blade edges are not usually sharp. A few no
doubt are merely cores, the residue from which flakes for
projectile points, etc., were removed. Most must have been
hafted as they are awkward to hold in the hand.
The 96 blades, particularly when combined with other
heavy chipped-stone implements (choppers, heavy scrapers,
etc.), constitute a rather high percentage of the artifacts
from this site. A similar frequency prevails in many sites
in central Texas. This may be due, in part, to the "catchall" nature of this category. On the other hand, they must
have been simply-made tools and judging from their appearance little time was spent in manufacturing them. It
seems plausible that semi-nomadic groups, such as are suggested for the Edwards Plateau and Central Texas Aspects,
would be reluctant to burden themselves with such implements when moving from one campsite to another, especially
in an area such as central Texas where flint is so abundant.
In short, the striking occurrence of heavy flint artifacts
(including choppers, heavy scrapers and blades) might be
attributed to availability of raw material, coupled with
periodic moving of camp.
Choppers

The choppers consist of heavy flint nodules with a blade
along one edge. All have a portion of the nodule crust on

the edge opposite the blade. This proximal end conveniently
fits the palm and is smooth so that it would not cut the user.
Twenty-two of the 30 choppers are very crudely made
and have broad, sinuous cutting edges (Plate 8, G) . Although almost every blade gives evidence of usage, four
are extremely battered. Probably these four were re-utilized
as hammerstones (Plate 8, A). If so, they constitute the
only hammerstones recognized at the site.
Three specimens have narrower blades than the above.
One, from the uppermost 6-inch zone, is well-made, with a
carefully chipped convex blade (Plate 8, H) . This type is
sometimes referred to as a "hand-axe. " The other two
specimens (such as Plate 8, D) are more like picks, although the cutting edges are blunt rather than pointed. In
workmanship they more closely resemble the other choppers than the hand-axe. The two "picks" were from the
surface and the 60-to 66-inch zone.
Seven of the choppers were found at depths below 18
inches, and an additional 11 were from the surface. The
remainder were excavated in the upper 18 inches.
Flake Choppers
This term is suggested for six chipped-stone implements
which closely resemble the choppers, except that they are
made from large flakes rather than cores (a small one is
illustrated in Plate 6, K). Like the choppers, they have a
portion of the flint nodule cortex opposite the blade edge.
The blade edge of each specimen shows evidence of use,
perhaps as a heavy knife. The five flake choppers found in
place were from the upper 18 inches, suggesting that they
may be associated primarily with the Central Texas Aspect.
They range from 7.5 to 12 em. in length and 4 to 6.5 em. in
width.
Ground-Stone Artifacts
Milling slabs and manos are the only ground-stone artifacts found at the site. Only one of the five milling slabs

46

Texas Archeological Society

is complete. It has a very small basin-shaped depression
and weighs about 25 pounds. Rotary motion, indicated by
the basin-shaped depression, is characteristic of all milling
slabs. Three are limestone, one is montmorillonite clay, and
one is a granite-like material. Only one is worn on both
faces. They came from both Edwards Plateau and Central
Texas Aspect levels.
Only four manos were recovered, a rather small number
compared to most sites in central Texas. Two manos are
quartzite, one quartz, and one granite. One mano found on
the surface is almost wedge-shaped in cross-section; another
is quite small, worn on all edges, but lacks a definite flat
surface (Plate 6, 0) . This latter specimen was found in the
small depression of the complete milling stone, at a depth
of about 18 inches below the surface. The remaining two
manos, both from the surface, are oval in shape and worn
flat on both surfaces. One of these latter has a shallow
longitudinal depression across the center of both faces .
These depressions are smooth, but are not narrow and deep
enough to suggest use as a shaft smoother; their purpose
is unknown.z

Miscellaneous Stone Artifacts
Three flat, limestone pebbles (Plate 6, P, Q) have deep
notches chipped in the lateral edges. All are stream worn
and are oval to rectangular in shape, ranging from 7.5 to
9 em. in length, 4.5 to 6 em. in width across notches, and 1.5
to 2.2 em. in thickness. None are battered at the ends , although the edges are sometimes battered, probably a result
of chipping the notches (Plate 6, P). These side-notched
pebbles are sometimes referred to as "sinkers", as they may
have been fastened to fish nets as weights. Although none
was found in place, they probably belong to the Edwards
Plateau Aspect occupation (Jackson, 1938, p. 78; Watt, 1938,
p. 31).
2. The reader is referred to the article in this Bulletin by John
Henry Ray, "Peculiar Manos from Lower Pease River Valley," for
other examples of such manos (Editor).

Excavation s at the Collins Site , Trav is County, Texas

47

A roughly elliptical piece of thin slate (Plate 6, R) is
lightly scored on both faces. A portion of the edge is worn
to a thin, flat facet. The slate measures 10.4 em. long, 5.5 em.
across the center, and is .7 em. in thickness. A considerably larger piece of limestone also has numerous longitudinal striations across one face . While both of these may
have been used as hones, the striations are short and very
shallow. An alternative and perhaps more plausible explanation is that they served as anvils in the cutting of
hides, fibers, etc. The scores could be compared to the marks
on a breadboard. Both were found in Edwards Plateau
levels.
A number of well-worn pebbles, of a variety of materials,
was found in various levels. These are far too large to have
been deposited by the creek. They must have been carried
in by human agency, although none show any definite indications of use.

Artifacts of Bone and Antler
Neither bone nor antler artifacts are common, presumably
due mainly to conditions of preservation. Of particular interest are two bone fishhooks , shaped much like modern
metal ones. One is nearly complete (Plate 7, K) and measures 4 em. in length and 1.2 em. across the lower end. The
other is a distal fragment. Both came from the 12 to 18 inch
layer, a zone of mixture of Edwards Plateau and Central
Texas Aspects. Although of very rare occurrence in central
Texas, one has been reported from a Central Texas component (Gatewood Site, Travis County, University of Texas
files) . It seems likely that the fishhooks from the Collins
Site are also associated with the Central Texas Aspect.
It is difficult to determine how the fishhooks were made,
but they must have been fashioned from the hard outer
layer of a relatively thick bone, possibly deer or bison. A
method of manufacturing a similarly shaped fishhook from
a deer toe bone is described in the Tenne ssee Archeo logist
(Anonymous, 1953, p. 240) and perhaps those from the Collins Site were made in a like manner.

Fragments of four splinter awls or pins constitute the
most common type of bone artifact. Three of these are from
definite Edwards Plateau Aspect context (below 30 inches);
the other was found in a mixed zone so that its cultural
affiliation is hard to ascertain. All four appear to have been
cut from leg bones (deer?) , then further shaped by smoothing. However, none is complete so that the total form cannot
be determined. There is no evidence of any decoration on
the awls. Discontinuous striations, visible on all specimens,
may represent scars from manufacture or incurred through
use. The tip of the most nearly complete awl (Plate 7, J)
tapers to a somewhat rounded point and shows signs of
wear. Such an implement would be useful as a punch in
weaving and sewing.
Although not complete, there are two deer ulnae which
may have been utilized as tools. Their edges are slightly
worn and they have vertical striations which appear to be
the result of usage; however the critical distal ends are
missing. Deer ulnae with cut and rounded distal ends are
believed to have been used as flaking tools. The unaltered
proximal end neatly fits into the hand and enables one to
secure a firm grip on the tool. The ulnae were excavated
within the upper 18 inches and may belong to either or
both aspects.
Two cylindrical, undecorated bone beads (Plate 7, L, M),
2 and 1.2 em. long respectively, were found in the 6 to 12
and 18 to 24 inch layers. They are apparently associated
with both the Central Texas and Edwards Plateau Aspects.
Similar bone beads have been found in Central Texas Aspect sites, but their occurrence in the Edwards Plateau Aspect is very rare.
None of the four fragmentary antler artifacts is complete enough for positive identification and one can only
speculate on what they might have been. A fragment from
near a deer skull has little evidence of having been altered,
except that one end has been cut and smoothed. It appears
to have been cylindrical in shape, possibly similar to the
drill (?) handle described for the Edwards Plateau Aspect

(Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954, p. 110). It came from the
6 to 12 inch level. The other three are tips of antlers, possibly the distal ends of flaking tools (Plate 7, N). One is
from the 6 to 12 inch zone, the other two from 18 to 24
inches.

Summary and Conclusions
Occupation of the Collins Site can be attributed to the
Edwards Plateau and Central Texas Aspects. Deeper zones
contained unmixed Edwards Plateau Aspect material,
whereas evidence of both aspects was found in the upper
18 inches. A Central Texas Aspect component was recognized primarily on the basis of the limited distributionwithin the first 18 inches-of arrow points and pottery. It
is these two traits which contrast most sharply with the
Edwards Plateau Aspect. With several exceptions, the remaining artifacts were distributed throughout the site,
though often varying considerably in frequency.
These two aspects are customarily analyzed as separate
cultural units, with emphasis placed on the differences between them. This approach is certainly not without good
foundation, but perhaps not enough attention has been directed to the similarities that exist between them. Correspondingly, the problem of their relationship has only been
briefly mentioned (Kelley, 1947a, 1947b; Stephenson, 1951).
The situation at the Collins Site calls attention to this problem and may contribute to the solving of it.
Undoubtedly some, or perhaps all, of the Edwards Plateau
Aspect artifacts are accidental intrusions into the upper
zones (i. e., picked up and possibly re-used and/or mixed
as a result of the activities of subsequent occupation, such as
would occur in the digging of pits, etc.) The Collins Site
is not unique in this respect as similar overlaps have been
reported elsewhere (Jackson, 1938; 1939; Kelley, 1947b; Miller and Jelks, 1952). However, it may be questioned that
such incidents can account for all of the mixture. It is possible, as has been suggested by Kelley (1947a, p . 107; 1947b,
p. 121), that the Edwards Plateau and Central Texas As-

50

pects were contemporaneous for a small part of their total
existence and that the Indians of each aspect frequented the
site at different intervals. An alternative possibility is that
the upper zones represent, at least in part, the transitional
period between the Edwards Plateau and Central Texas Aspects-a time when several new traits were being accepted, but had not entirely replaced older ones.
Despite the absence of empirical data to the contrary, it
is highly improbable that the bow and pottery are local
inventions. The concepts, if not actual specimens, of these
items probably spread into central Texas from an adjacent
region (or regions?), though the source has not been identified to date. However, this does not necessarily mean that
these traits were accompanied by a change in the population
of central Texas. 3 Unfortunately there is no information on
skeletal remains available for comparative studies, to determine whether or not different populations are represented.
There is evidence suggesting that Central Texas Aspect is
by and large a development out of the Edwards Plateau
Aspect, with distinctive accretions. The total distribution
in Texas of the two complexes is approximately the same,
and components of both aspects are commonly represented
at a single site. In addition, many artifacts appear to be
shared, and the tool inventory is essentially Â·the same. More
importantly, certain cultural traditions, so far as can be reconstructed from archeological data, remained basically unchanged. Hunting, supplemented by food-collecting, continued to be the principal means of livelihood. Because of
the presence of trade pottery obtained from agricultural
Caddoan groups to the east, it is probable that people of
the Central Texas Aspect were at least aware of plant
domestication. However, with some possible exceptions in
regions nearest the Caddo, there is no good evidence that
3. It is not clear whether or not Kelley (1947a, 1947b) regards
the people of the Central Texas Aspect as ethnically distinct from
those of the Edwards Plateau Aspect.

agriculture was ever actually practiced in central Texas.
Its failure to spread here may lie primarily in the deeplyrooted non-agricultural economy of central Texas, based on
an abundance of natural food products, rather than any climatic or physiographic factors.
All known habitation areas of both aspects are campsites
of a more or less temporary nature, as opposed to the village
sites of sedentary groups. Admittedly, Edwards Plateau
Aspect sites are usually larger and thicker, presumably
because they were occupied for a longer time than those of
the Central Texas Aspect. It can be inferred that these sites
represent favored camping spots of hunting and gathering
groups, to which they returned repeatedly. One might
speculate further that the prevailing type of social organization of both aspects was that of a band, which in turn probably consisted of a variable number of families, such as has
been described for the historic Coahuiltecan (Ruecking,
1954) and to some extent for the Tonkawa (Sjoberg, 1953,
pp. 289-90) . These bands might have been further grouped
into a loose tribal organization, bound by a common language and culture.
If the above assumptions are valid, which is by no means
certain, it seems likely that there was a transitional period
between the two aspects. Identification of this hypothetical
period is difficult, but there are some indications . Excavations at Blum Rockshelter in Hill County (Jelks, 1953)
and at Smith Rockshelter (Anonymous, 1954 ; Suhm, 1955)
recovered occupations in the lowest levels which were not
typical of either the Edwards Plateau or the Central Texas
Aspect. The lowest zone at Smith Rockshelter can be tied
in with the nearby Collins Site largely through the common presence of Darl points. 4 How much (if any) of the
upper 18 inches at the Collins Site can be attributed to this
hypothetical phase is uncertain.
4. In the Blum Rockshelter, Yarb rough rather than Darl points
occurred in the lowest levels. The t wo types are quite similar and
were probably contemporaneous.

The Edwards Plateau Aspect has been divided into three
foci (Round Rock, Clear F ork, and Uvalde) on the basis of
a single dominant type of dart point for each (Kelley, 1947a,
1947b) . The Central Texas Aspect has been divided into
the two foci (Toyah and Austin) on the basis of a single
dominant type of arrow point for each (Idem) . At the Collins Site, as well as many other sites in Central Texas, the
projectile-point types for all of these foci occur. The writer
has therefore preferred to discuss this site only in terms of
the Edwards Plateau and Central Texas Aspects.
Dating the Collins Site occupation is difficult and at present can only be stated in general terms. A large number of
charcoal and snail-shell samples was collected for radiocarbon dating, but none have been analyzed as yet. From the
absence of European objects in association with Indian material, it is assumed the site was abandoned not later than
about 1600 A D. The beginning of occupation cannot be
determined but quite probably preceded the Christian era
by a considerable time. A geological analysis of the terrace
deposits which accumulated along with human occupation
has not been attempted here, but should provide some age
estimates when done.
