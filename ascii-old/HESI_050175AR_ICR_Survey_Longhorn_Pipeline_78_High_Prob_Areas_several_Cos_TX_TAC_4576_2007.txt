MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During the months of May and June 2007, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
(Horizon) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey within 78 archeological high
probability areas (AHPAs) along Longhorn Partners Pipeline, L.P. (Longhorn) pipeline right-ofway (ROW) between Longhorn’s Cedar Valley and Fort McKavett pump stations in Hays,
Blanco, Gillespie, Llano, Mason, Kimble, Menard, and Schleicher counties, Texas. Horizon
conducted the cultural resources survey on behalf of Longhorn and Magellan Pipeline
Company, L.P. (Magellan), the contract operator for Longhorn. The investigations along the
ROW on privately held lands were conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended, while the investigations along the ROW
where it crosses Pedernales Falls State Park were conducted in compliance with Section 106 of
the NHPA as well as the Antiquities Code of Texas. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if any archeological sites were present within the ROW and, if so, to determine their
eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or for formal
designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs). The investigations within Pedernales
Falls State Park were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit No. 4576.
The intensive cultural resources survey of the 78 AHPAs resulted in the documentation
of 12 newly recorded and 3 previously recorded archeological sites. The 12 newly recorded
sites consist of 11 prehistoric lithic scatters (41BC146, 41GL367, 41GL368, 41KM231,
41KM232, 41KM233, 41KM234, 41LL469, 41MS79, 41MS80, and 41SL23) and 1 prehistoric
open campsite (41MS81). The 3 previously recorded sites consist of 1 prehistoric open
campsite (41GL300) and 2 prehistoric lithic scatters (41KM207 and 41GL301).
No
archeological sites were documented within the ROW in Pedernales Falls State Park.
Of these 15 sites, site 41LL469 was found to possess the potential for buried deposits.
While cultural materials were recovered from shovel tests on this site, the survey level
investigations were not sufficient to assess the integrity of the cultural deposits. As such, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the NRHP eligibility status of site 41LL469 remains undetermined.
Horizon therefore recommends archeological monitoring on site 41LL469 to assess its internal
stratigraphy only if any maintenance activities are scheduled within its boundaries.
Site 41MS81 was documented as a relatively high density campsite near the confluence
of 2 streams. Construction of the original pipeline ROW and erosion have served to strip the
portions of this site within the existing ROW down to bedrock, but uninvestigated portions of this

site beyond the limits of the ROW could conceivably contain intact cultural deposits. As such, it
is Horizon’s opinion that the NRHP eligibility status of site 41MS81 as a whole is undetermined.
However, due to the lack of intact, buried deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion the portion of this site
within the existing ROW is a non-contributing element to any potential NRHP eligibility of the
site and warrants no further investigations. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for the portion of site 41MS81 within the confines of the existing
pipeline ROW. However, if any future maintenance is proposed beyond the limits of the current
ROW at this location, the portions of the site beyond the current ROW should be assessed to
determine if intact, buried deposits are present.
The remaining 13 sites (41BC146, 41GL300, 41GL301, 41GL367, 41GL368, 41KM207,
41KM231, 41KM232, 41KM233, 41KM234, 41MS79, 41MS80, and 41SL23) were found to be
nondescript scatters of aboriginal debris on exposed limestone/granite surfaces or within
extremely shallow contexts. As a result, it is Horizon’s professional opinion that neither
significant cultural resources, nor historic properties listed in or eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP), exist within the area of potential effect for any of these 13
project locations and therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for
these 13 sites.
As for all other locations within the 78 AHPAs where negative findings were produced,
Horizon also recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted. However, in the event
that any human skeletal remains or burial items are encountered during future maintenance
activities within any portion of the 78 AHPAs discussed herein, including previously surveyed
areas, activities at the specific location of the find should cease and the THC should be notified
immediately of the discovery.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 78 Archeological High Probability Areas between the Cedar
Valley and Fort McKavett Pump Stations on the Longhorn Pipeline Right-of-Way

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey conducted
within 78 archeological high probability areas (AHPAs) along the Longhorn Partners Pipeline,
L.P. (Longhorn) pipeline right-of-way (ROW) between Longhorn’s Cedar Valley and Fort
McKavett pump stations in Hays, Blanco, Gillespie, Llano, Mason, Kimble, Menard, and
Schleicher counties, Texas (Figure 1). Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted the cultural resources survey on behalf of Longhorn and Magellan Pipeline
Company, L.P. (Magellan), the contract operator for Longhorn. Although the Longhorn ROW is
an existing, previously disturbed ROW, cultural resources investigations on the ROW prior to
future construction are required by a Programmatic Agreement between Longhorn, the US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the US Department of Transportation (DOT). As
such, the investigations along the ROW on privately held lands were conducted in compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended, while
the investigations along the ROW where it crosses Pedernales Falls State Park were conducted
in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA as well as the Antiquities Code of Texas. The
purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were present within the ROW
and, if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) and/or for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs). The
investigations within Pedernales Falls State Park were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) Permit No. 4576.
The 78 AHPAs discussed herein represent a portion of all the AHPAs delineated along
the length of the Longhorn ROW between Waller and Crane counties, Texas (Appendix A,
Sheets 7 to 14 of 21). Horizon delineated the AHPAs along the ROW based on: 1) distance
from water sources; 2) the location of previously recorded archeological sites within or near the
ROW; 3) the locations and results of previous cultural resources surveys along the ROW; and 4)
areas that have experienced considerable prior impacts that would negate the potential for
intact cultural deposits. The delineated areas were reviewed by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), which concurred with the delineated AHPAs in a letter dated 23 May 2007.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of a review of the delineated AHPAs, an
intensive pedestrian survey of each of the 78 AHPAs, and the production of a report suitable for
review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the THC’s Rules of
Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s Cultural

Resources Director) served as the Principal Investigator for the project. Jared Wiersema,
Abigail Peyton, Reign Clark, and Michael Mudd conducted the field investigations on various
dates between May and June 2007.
The AHPAs reported herein consist of 78 linear areas along the Longhorn ROW that
total 84.4 miles (135.0 kilometers [km]) in length by 50 feet [ft] (15.3 meters [m]) in width.
Overall, the 78 AHPAs total 511.5 acres (206 hectares [ha]). The Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile on
linear projects measuring 100 feet in width. As the Longhorn ROW measures only 50 feet in
width, 8 shovel tests per mile (675 shovel tests along the 84.4 miles of assessed AHPAs) were
necessary to meet the TSMASS. Horizon conducted 568 shovel tests within the 78 AHPAs.
The TSMASS were not met due to the fact that the majority of the assessed areas consisted of
upland ridges of exposed limestone or granite bedrock characteristic of the Texas Hill Country
where the potential for buried deposits was minimal. However, this afforded excellent ground
surface visibility along the existing ROW, allowing for a thorough investigation of the areas
assessed.
The intensive cultural resources survey of the 78 AHPAs resulted in the documentation
of 12 newly recorded and 3 previously recorded archeological sites. The 12 newly recorded
sites consist of 11 prehistoric lithic scatters (41BC146, 41GL367, 41GL368, 41KM231,
41KM232, 41KM233, 41KM234, 41LL469, 41MS79, 41MS80, and 41SL23) and 1 prehistoric
open campsite (41MS81). The 3 previously recorded sites consist of 1 prehistoric open
campsite (41GL300) and 2 prehistoric lithic scatters (41KM207 and 41GL301).
No
archeological sites were documented within the ROW in Pedernales Falls State Park.
Of these 15 sites, site 41LL469 was found to possess the potential for buried deposits.
While cultural materials were recovered from shovel tests on this site, the survey level
investigations were not sufficient to assess the integrity of the cultural deposits. As such, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the NRHP eligibility status of site 41LL469 remains undetermined.
Horizon therefore recommends archeological monitoring on site 41LL469 to assess its internal
stratigraphy only if any maintenance activities are scheduled within its boundaries.
Site 41MS81 was documented as a relatively high density campsite near the confluence
of 2 streams. Construction of the original pipeline ROW and erosion have served to strip the
portions of this site within the existing ROW down to bedrock, but uninvestigated portions of this
site beyond the limits of the ROW could conceivably contain intact cultural deposits. As such, it
is Horizon’s opinion that the NRHP eligibility status of site 41MS81 as a whole is undetermined.
However, due to the lack of intact, buried deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion the portion of this site
within the existing ROW is a non-contributing element to any potential NRHP eligibility of the
site and warrants no further investigations. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for the portion of site 41MS81 within the confines of the existing
pipeline ROW. However, if any future maintenance is proposed beyond the limits of the current
ROW at this location, the portions of the site beyond the current ROW should be assessed to
determine if intact, buried deposits are present.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

The remaining 13 sites (41BC146, 41GL300, 41GL301, 41GL367, 41GL368, 41KM207,
41KM231, 41KM232, 41KM233, 41KM234, 41MS79, 41MS80, and 41SL23) were found to be
nondescript scatters of aboriginal debris on exposed limestone/granite surfaces or within

significant cultural resources, nor historic properties listed in or eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP), exist within the area of potential effect for any of these 13
project locations and therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for
these 13 sites.
As for all other locations within the 78 AHPAs where negative findings were produced,
Horizon also recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted. However, in the event
that any human skeletal remains or burial items are encountered during future maintenance
activities within any portion of the 78 AHPAs discussed herein, including previously surveyed
areas, activities at the specific location of the find should cease and the THC should be notified
immediately of the discovery.

2.0 HIGH PROBABILITY AREAS

The 78 AHPAs along the pipeline ROW that were assessed during the current
investigations are located in Hays, Blanco, Gillespie, Llano, Mason, Kimble, Menard, and
Schleicher counties, Texas (see Figure 1). They can be found on the following US Geological
Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles:
Dripping Springs, Shingle Hills,
Hammetts Crossing, Pedernales Falls, Johnson City, Rocky Creek, Willow City, Crabapple,
House Mountain, Cherry Mountain, Loyal Valley, Panther Creek, Monument Mountain SE,
Monument Mountain, Sheep Run Creek, Yates, London, Brewer Hollow, Julio Draw, Rust
Ranch, McKegan Draw NE, Fort McKavett, Coal Kiln Draw, Coralina Ranch, Buffalo Well, and
Adams SE, Texas. Due to the extensive length of the ROW, maps depicting the 78 AHPAs
have been included in portable document format (PDF) files within Appendix A (see Sheets 7 to
14 of 21).
Most recently, the majority of necessary maintenance activities along the pipeline ROW
have been occurring between Longhorn’s Cedar Valley (Hays County) and Fort McKavett
(Schleicher County) pump stations. For this reason, Magellan and Longhorn requested that
Horizon assess the 78 AHPAs identified between these 2 pump stations prior to maintenance
activities in order to facilitate the necessary activities without the need for individual cultural
resources surveys at each of the maintenance locations. Table 1 below presents each AHPA,
followed by the county in which it is located, Longhorn’s mileposts (MP) and engineering station
numbers (ESNs) along the ROW where each AHPA begins and ends, and the length of each
AHPA. Table 1 also lists the total length of AHPAs within each county. In all, the 78 AHPAs
between Longhorn’s Cedar Valley and Fort McKavett pump stations total 84.4 miles (135.0 km)
in length by 50 ft (15.3 m) in width. This equates to an overall area of 511.5 acres (206 ha).
All of the 78 AHPAs are located on privately held lands with the exception of 2 (Blanco-3
and Blanco-4). These 2 AHPAs are located within the southern portion of Pedernales Falls
State Park, thereby requiring the acquisition of TAC Permit No. 4576 for the investigations.
Generally speaking, all of the AHPAs are located in rural areas that can be characterized as
rangeland. Typical of the Texas Hill County, terrain within the assessed areas was generally
rolling to quite hilly, with the hills and slopes interspersed with countless small drainages, larger
creeks, and major rivers such as the Pedernales. Although the existing ROW is cleared and
maintained, areas bordering the ROW were most often covered with stands of Ashe juniper and
live oak mottes, also typical of the Texas Hill County. Soils encountered along the ROW were
almost always shallow and cobbly clay loams interspersed over exposed limestone or granite

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of Central Texas spans the known cultural-historical sequence:
Paleo-Indian, 11,200 to 8000 BP; Archaic, 8000 to 1400 BP; and Late Prehistoric, 1400 to 400
BP. A brief breakdown of this general sequence is presented below.

3.1

PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD (CA. 11,200 TO 8000 BP)

The Paleo-Indian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in the Central
Texas region. This stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These
populations probably practiced a foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence
(Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976), although the best-known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of
large mammals, including Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as
the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that, during the early part of
the Paleo-Indian, the Clovis stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g., mammoth,
bison, and horse) as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and raccoons. A
multitude of plants are presumed to have also been an important part of the aboriginal diet.
However, during the later part of the Paleo-Indian period, the Folsom and Plainview stages,
subsistence seems to have depended more heavily on the specialized hunting of big game,
particularly bison. This presumption is based on the fact that only camps, stone-working
locations, and kill sites, mostly in or near grassland habitats, have been documented (Collins
1995:382). This change was most likely attributable to the climate, which had become warmer
and drier than the previous Clovis stage.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8000 TO 1400 BP)

The Archaic period, which covers two-thirds of Central Texas prehistory (Collins 1995),
is divided into 3 subperiods: Early (8000 to 5000 BP), Middle (5000 to 3000 BP), and Late
(3000 to 1200 BP) (Hester 1986). The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a
similar transition found world-wide at approximately the same time, the most noted indicators
being the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a
gradual decrease in moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying
trends first noted during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these
climatic changes was a greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was
already the case in most places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

earth ovens become more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game
continued. Although still nomadic, people of the Archaic period restricted their travel to smaller
areas than did the Paleo-Indian groups.

3.3

EARLY ARCHAIC (8000 TO 5000 BP)

The Early Archaic, the least understood period, is distinguished by the switch from
PaleoIndian lanceolate-shaped points to notched-and-stemmed points. Overall, the Early
Archaic patterns in Texas are fairly similar throughout the state. Hester (1989) observed that,
prior to 5000 BP, the late Holocene hunters and foragers were essentially indistinguishable in
terms of subsistence strategies across Region 3, which includes the Central Texas Plateau
Prairie, South Texas Plains, and Lower Pecos Canyonlands. After that date, regionally
distinctive projectile points emerge. Hughes (1991) also noted similarities when he wrote that
the Early Archaic typological developments on the Texas High Plains resembled developments
in Central and Southwestern Texas as well as in other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. The wide distribution of artifacts suggests that mobility was
high and territories relatively undefined. McKinney (1981), among others, has noted that the
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open campsites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and Hall’s Cave. Lithic
materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones, projectile
points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork and
Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared in the Late PaleoIndian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).

3.4

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (5000 TO 3000 BP)

The Middle Archaic is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect an
expanding population, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and changes in
settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and McGraw 1985:38).
Hester (1986) suggests that, during this period, the inhabitants of the Balcones Escarpment
region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of abundant regional
resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
upland areas, and special-activity sites such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large burned rock features (hearths and rock ovens) of the early
part of the Middle Archaic gave way in the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens (Collins
1995).
These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different

16

050175_arch_survey_report_high_prob_areas

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 78 Archeological High Probability Areas between the Cedar
Valley and Fort McKavett Pump Stations on the Longhorn Pipeline Right-of-Way

subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represent intensive
utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more
frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. This latter explanation has been
supported by a number of recent investigations where evidence of preserved camas bulbs have
been recovered within oven and midden contexts (Brownlow 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Bush 2004;
Dering 1999, 2002; Mauldin et al. 2003; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Middle Archaic projectile
points include Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989), the latter of which is
considered by Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment
region.

3.5

LATE ARCHAIC (3000 TO 1400 BP)

The Late Archaic is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of the
subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of
burned rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter
part of this period (Collins 1995). Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic
and may reflect the establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Black 1989:30;
Black and McGraw 1985; Story 1985:49). Hester (1986) suggests that the development of
wide-ranging trade contacts also may have occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile
points include triangular types such as Lange, Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with
smaller, expanding-stem points such as Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.
Although Hester (1986) places the Late Archaic between 3000 and 1400 BP, a later
carving of the Archaic period by Johnson and Goode (1994) attempts to push back the initiation
point of the Late Archaic to around 4300 BP. This more recent division is based on what is
seen as a strong continuity between the material culture and subsistence practices of groups
utilizing the Pedernales point style and those utilizing the later Montell point style. Primarily,
Johnson and Goode (1994) point to similarities in the blade shape of these 2 styles, as well as
similar large, billet-thinned knives utilized during the times of these point styles. They also note
the continuance of Pedernales period plant baking within existing burned rock middens by later
groups utilizing Montell points. In fact, they view this continuity as evidence of a distinct culture
or “folk” on the eastern Edwards Plateau.
In addition to attempting to push back the initiation date of the Late Archaic period,
Johnson and Goode (1994) have also attempted to further divide the Late Archaic period into 2
subperiods (Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II) based on the material cultures as well as climatic
conditions. Their Late Archaic I subperiod coincides with the Dry Edwards Interval when xeric
conditions persisted between 4300 and 2600 BP. Diagnostic projectile points of this subperiod
include the Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville styles. The Lange style
may also correspond to this subperiod based on the recovery of Lange specimens in
association with both Montell and Castroville specimens at site 41WM815 dated between 2800
to 2400 BP (Brownlow 2003). Johnson and Goode (1994:34) note that burned rock middens on
the Edwards Plateau during the Late Archaic I subperiod are more frequent than in any other
period. The increase in burned rock middens during this subperiod is undoubtedly a result of
the xeric climatic conditions that effectively expanded the ranges of certain geophytes such as

HJN 050175 AR

17

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

sotol and yucca―foodstuffs that require extended baking periods (in stone-lined ovens) in order
to break down their starches into edible simple sugars. The xeric conditions likely resulted in
the spread of grasslands on the plateau, which would have in turn attracted herds of buffalo.
Plentiful geophytic plants, as well as the presence of buffalo herds, may account for an increase
in human populations in the region as well (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1985).
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic II subperiod spans the time period between
2600 and 1400 BP. They equate this subperiod to more mesic climatic conditions that resulted
in the active aggradation of floodplains at many localities. The Marcos, Ensor, Frio, and Darl
dart point styles are viewed as indicators of this subperiod. Observing a break in the broad
blade stylistic tradition suggested for the Pedernales and Montell styles, Johnson and Goode
(1994:37) suggest that similarities in the Marcos style dart points to styles on the Southern
Plains may indicate an influx of new occupants from the Southern Plains or perhaps a borrowing
of projectile-making techniques from this region. In addition to a perceived influx of new people
or technologies, Johnson and Goode (1994) also suggest some degree of social intercourse
with groups from the eastern US. This is evidenced by the recovery of materials such as whelk
shells and atlatl weights of exotic stone from burials dating to this time period. Although not
conclusive, Johnson and Goode (1994:37) suggest that these materials may indicate a
spreading of Eastern religious cult ideas into the region. While it cannot be conclusively stated
that groups on the Edwards Plateau subscribed to the beliefs and practices of the Eastern
religions, the evidence does suggest that groups on the plateau participated in extensive trading
with Eastern groups, primarily contributing large, thin corner-tanged knives made from local
Edwards chert.

3.6

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1400 TO 400 BP)

The Late Prehistoric period is separated from the preceding Archaic by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this period: the Austin
(ca. 1400 to 800 BP) and Toyah (ca. 800 to 400 BP) phases. The Austin phase is characterized
by the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart to that of the bow and arrow and arrow
points, particularly the expanding-stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also distinguished by a
decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was a shift from open
to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of these changes,
most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and settlement patterns
appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Prewitt 1974).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contractingstem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited horticulture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. However, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that was
bringing in the Caddoan pottery.

3.7

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 400 BP TO PRESENT)

The Historic period, which began with the arrival of Europeans into the region, can be
divided into 3 subperiods: early, middle, and late. Only a brief overview of the period is given
here. For a more detailed essay, see Newcomb 1993:1-63.
The first documented arrival of Europeans into Central Texas dates to the early 18th
century (Newcomb 1993). Their influence, however, preceded their arrival. In the late 17th
century, natives from northern Mexico and southern Texas began migrating into Central Texas
to escape forced occupation and labor in the Spanish mines, missions, and on Spanish
ranches. At approximately the same time, horses stolen from the Spanish had become an
integral part of the Apache way of life. These mounted, nomadic bison hunters of the High
Plains enjoyed a tremendous advantage over their pedestrian enemies. They terrorized native
groups to the east and southeast of their High Plains homeland, forcing many to flee, some into
Central Texas (Newcomb 1993:2). Thus, the first Europeans into the region encountered native
groups fragmented by the growth of the Spanish missions, the raids of the Apache, and the
diseases that swept before the physical presence of Europeans. Their accounts, therefore, do
not provide direct analogs to prehistoric lifeway patterns, but rather represent a time of drastic
cultural change (Collins 1995). A few indigenous cultural patterns may have prevailed through
time. Along with large, diffuse encampments composed of peoples with mixed ethnic
affiliations, small band-sized residential camps, both dating to this particular period, are found in
Central Texas (Collins 1995:386). These latter sites may represent indigenous groups.
The middle Historic subperiod began about 1730 and ended about 1800 as the mission
system was failing (Hester 1989; Collins 1995:386). Historic documents of this period make
reference to remnants of native groups living in the missions, primarily in Bexar County (Collins
1995). Toward the end of this subperiod, the Comanche began to move into Northwestern
Texas from the high plains. Records of their presence in Central Texas at this time tend to be
highly biased since they are provided mostly from the hostile perspective of Anglo settlers
(Collins 1995).
The late Historic subperiod is composed of small numbers of mission Indians, “far flung
nomadic native groups (primarily the Comanche),” and an archeological record of the European
presence (Collins 1995:387). The Comanche presence began fading in the mid- to late 19th
century.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 78 Archeological High Probability Areas between the Cedar
Valley and Fort McKavett Pump Stations on the Longhorn Pipeline Right-of-Way

4.0 GENERAL METHODOLOGY

As previously noted, the 78 AHPAs discussed herein represent a portion of all the
AHPAs delineated along the length of Longhorn’s pipeline ROW between Waller and Crane
counties, Texas (see Table 1 and Appendix A). Horizon delineated the AHPAs along the ROW
based on: 1) distance from water sources; 2) the location of previously recorded archeological
sites within or near the ROW; 3) the locations and results of previous cultural resources surveys
along the ROW; and 4) areas that have experienced considerable prior impacts that would
negate the potential for intact cultural deposits. The delineated areas were reviewed by the
THC, which concurred with the delineated AHPAs in a letter dated 23 May 2007.
Once the THC approved of the delineated AHPAs, a 2-person Horizon field crew
completed an intensive pedestrian survey of each the 78 AHPAs between the Cedar Valley and
Fort McKavett pump stations during May and June 2007. At times, a second 2-person field
crew was also utilized during the field effort. The survey of the 78 AHPAs included both
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing (when possible) along the length of
each AHPA. However, in areas where shallow clay soils or exposed bedrock were present,
shovel testing was not conducted. As most assessed areas contained only shallow soils or
exposed limestone or granite bedrock, shovel tests of significant depth were generally not
possible. The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile on linear projects
measuring 100 feet in width. As the Longhorn ROW measures only 50 feet in width, 8 shovel
tests per mile (675 shovel tests along the 84.4 miles of assessed AHPAs) were necessary to
meet the TSMASS. Horizon conducted 568 shovel tests within the 78 AHPAs. The TSMASS
were not met due to the fact that the majority of the assessed areas consisted of upland ridges
of exposed limestone or granite bedrock characteristic of the Texas Hill Country where the
potential for buried deposits was minimal. However, this afforded excellent ground surface
visibility along the existing ROW, allowing for a thorough investigation of the areas assessed.
During the field investigations, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils,
land forms, shovel tests, cultural material observed (if any), etc. If any new archeological sites
were encountered, standardized site forms were completed and submitted to the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent housing. Similarly, “re-visit” forms
were completed for any previously recorded sites encountered during the investigations.
Standardized shovel test forms were completed for each excavated shovel test, and digital
photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. Location data were gathered

during the survey via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 27

as primarily negative with only a few exceptions, the resulting shovel test data and locations
have not been included in this document.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

The intensive cultural resources survey of the 78 AHPAs resulted in the documentation
of 12 newly recorded and 3 previously recorded archeological sites. The 12 newly recorded
sites consist of 11 prehistoric lithic scatters (41BC146, 41GL367, 41GL368, 41KM231,
41KM232, 41KM233, 41KM234, 41LL469, 41MS79, 41MS80, and 41SL23) and 1 prehistoric
open campsite (41MS81). The 3 previously recorded sites consist of 1 prehistoric open
campsite (41GL300) and 2 prehistoric lithic scatters (41KM207 and 41GL301). Each of the 15
documented sites is discussed separately below.

5.1

SITE 41BC146 (AHPA BLANCO-5)

General Description
Site 41BC146 was recorded in AHPA Blanco-5 as a sparse prehistoric lithic scatter
located on a broad, gently rolling upland terrace adjacent to an unnamed tributary east of the
Pedernales River (Figure 11). The site stretches across an eroded landform dominated by
native grasses and wildflowers within the cleared pipeline ROW. Thick stands of oak, mesquite,
and juniper interspersed with patches of cleared pastureland line the periphery of the ROW.
Soils across the site consist primarily of an extremely thin lens of sediment (0 to 2 cm) capping
outcrops of near-surface limestone bedrock, which effectively confines cultural materials to
surface contexts. Due to recent spring rains, seasonal foliage was consistently thick within the
ROW and at times obscured the surface visibility. A general photograph of site 41BC146 is
presented in Figure 12.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41BC146 consist of a sparse scatter of
approximately 12 to15 pieces of chert debitage, 1 core fragment, and 1 biface fragment, all
documented on the surface over an 80.0-m (262.4-ft) long area within the existing pipeline
ROW. Artifacts were found to be evenly dispersed across the landform with no definable areas
of high artifact concentration noted. No temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts were encountered
during the recording of this site. A photograph of the sample artifact assemblage from site
41BC146 is presented in Figure 13.

Cultural Features
While abundant limestone gravels and cobbles were observed covering the surface of
the site within the pipeline ROW, none of the surface gravels appeared to have been collectively
utilized by aboriginals to facilitate daily activities such as cooking. If prehistoric hearths or other
similar features were indeed once employed at this locale, they have likely since been
destroyed. Presently, no evidence of cultural features was identified during the recording of this
site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the observed surface scatter, the horizontal extent of site 41BC146 measures
approximately 80.0 m (262.4 ft) east/west. Investigations were not pursued outside of the 15.0m (50.0-ft) wide ROW; as such, the north/south boundaries of the site remain undetermined.
The east/west boundaries were determined based on the distribution of surface artifacts.
The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site 41BC146 resides is
entirely restricted to surface contexts, as the upland terrace consists of eroded limestone
bedrock with little to no soils present.
Summary
In general, site 41BC146 is a sparse surficial lithic scatter located in an area that has
been repeatedly impacted by a series of natural and artificial events ranging from sheet erosion
to clearing and mechanical excavation related to the installation of the pipeline. As the site
possesses no intact buried sediments or temporally diagnostic artifacts, it is Horizon’s opinion
that site 41BC146 is considered to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further
investigations on this site are warranted.

5.2

SITE 41GL300 (AHPA GILLESPIE-4)

General Description
Site 41GL300 is a previously recorded site found in AHPA Gillespie-4. It was originally
recorded as a prehistoric surficial lithic scatter located on a broad, gently rolling upland terrace
adjacent to Bird Hollow (Figure 14). The site stretches across an eroded landform dominated
by bedrock exposures and patches of native grasses within the cleared pipeline ROW. Thick
stands of oak, mesquite, and juniper line the periphery of the ROW. Soils across the site
consist primarily of an extremely thin lens of sediment (0 to 2 cm) capping outcrops of nearsurface sandstone bedrock, which effectively confines cultural materials to surface contexts.
Due to recent spring rains, seasonal foliage was occasionally thick within the ROW, especially
along the terrace slope of Bird Hollow, which at times obscured the surface visibility. A general
photograph of site 41GL300 is presented in Figure 15.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

Figure 15. General view of site 41GL300
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41GL300 consist of a dense scatter of secondary
and tertiary chert debitage, as well as 1 Perdiz point, 1 distal tip fragment, 2 medial dart
fragments, 1 Frio point fragment, 1 bifacial preform, 2 arrow point fragments, and numerous
core fragments. Sparse surface scatters of heat-treated chert and burned sandstone were also
observed within the site boundaries. Artifacts were found to be heavily dispersed across the
upper terrace landform with no definable areas of high artifact concentration along its steep
easterly slope towards Bird Hollow. The temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts encountered during
the recording of this site indicate Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric (Toyah phase)
occupations at the site. A photograph of the sample artifact assemblage from site 41GL300 is
presented in Figure16.
Cultural Features
The abundance of chert and sandstone outcrops along the upland terrace of Bird Hollow
indicates a significant source of raw materials utilized by its aboriginal inhabitants. The surface
chert cobbles appear to have been collectively utilized by aboriginals to facilitate activities such
as tool manufacturing, while sandstone and limestone cobbles may have been used in cooking
activities. If prehistoric hearths or other similar features were indeed once present at this locale,
they have likely since been destroyed. Presently, no evidence of cultural features was identified
during the recording of this site.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the observed surface scatter, the horizontal extent of site 41GL300 measures
approximately 450.0 m (1476.3 ft) east/west. Investigations were not pursued outside of the
15.0-m (50.0-ft) wide ROW; as such, the north/south boundaries of the site remain
undetermined. The east/west boundaries were determined based on the distribution of surface
artifacts.
The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site 41GL300 resides is
entirely restricted to surface contexts, as the upland terrace consists of eroded sandstone
bedrock with little to no soils present.
Summary
In general, site 41GL300 is a dense surficial lithic scatter located in an area that has
been repeatedly impacted by a series of natural and artificial events ranging from sheet erosion
to clearing and mechanical excavation related to the installation of the pipeline. Although there
are temporally diagnostic artifacts present at the site, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41GL300 is
considered to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP due to its lack of intact, buried cultural
deposits and that no further investigations on this site are warranted.

5.3

SITE 41GL301 (AHPA GILLESPIE-4)

General Description
Site 41GL301 is another previously recorded site found in AHPA Gillespie-4. It was
originally recorded as a sparse prehistoric surficial lithic scatter located on an eroded interfluvial
bedrock terrace between 2 branches of Bird Hollow (Figure 17). The site stretches across a
completely eroded landform within the cleared pipeline ROW corridor. Thick stands of oak,
mesquite, and juniper line the periphery of the ROW. With the absence of soils within the site,
outcrops of sandstone bedrock comprise the site’s surface, confining cultural materials to
surface contexts. Due to the eroded surface, ground visibility was obscured only in areas with
sparse patches of native grasses and detritus material from neighboring trees. A general
photograph of site 41GL301 is presented in Figure 18.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41GL301 consist only of 3 secondary chert
flakes. No temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts or burned rocks were encountered during the
recording of this site.
Cultural Features
No evidence of any cultural features was encountered on this site.

15.0-m (50.0-ft) wide ROW; as such, the north/south boundaries of the site remain
undetermined. The east/west boundaries were determined based on the distribution of surface
artifacts.

SITE 41GL367 (AHPA GILLESPIE-12)

General Description
Site 41GL367 is a diffuse prehistoric surficial lithic scatter located on the undulating
rocky terraces west Keener Branch in AHPA Gillespie-12 (Figure 19). Nearby, a series of large
granite hilltops form a crescent shape, which effectively directs overland sheet flow to the north
across the ridges where site 41GL367 is located. Vegetation is sparse within the actual pipeline
ROW, consisting of sporadic clumps of native grasses with ground cover growing thicker along
the periphery of the cleared corridor. Surface visibility was consistently high (ca. 90%) across
the site, with cultural materials found intermixed with decomposed granite gravels. Additionally,
outcrops of pink feldspar-rich granite bedrock characteristic of the Texas Hill Country were
frequently encountered within the pipeline ROW. Topography across the site is mostly rolling
towards the west with a steep drop-off into the Keener Branch stream course to the east. A
photograph of site 41GL367 is presented in Figure 20.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41GL367 consist of a sparse scatter of
approximately 25 to 30 pieces of lithic debitage documented on the surface over a 50.0-m
(164.0-ft) long area within the pipeline ROW. Artifacts were found to be relatively evenly
dispersed across the landform with no definable areas of high artifact concentration noted. No
temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts were encountered during the recording of this site. A
photograph of the sample artifact assemblage from site 41GL367 is presented in Figure 21.
Cultural Features
No intact cultural features were identified during the recording of this site. As the area
has been intensively cleared in the past, any remnants of cultural features present on the
surface have likely been destroyed.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the observed surface scatter, the horizontal extent of site 41GL367 measures
approximately 50.0 m (164.0 ft) east/west. Investigations were not pursued outside of the 15.0m (50.0-ft) wide pipeline ROW; as such, the north/south site boundaries have not been formally
determined. The western boundary was determined based on the distribution of surface
artifacts and the eastern boundary was found to coincide closely with the local topography. A
marked decrease in artifact densities was noted at the easternmost edge of the landform before
it slopes off toward Keener Branch.
The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site 41GL367 resides is
entirely restricted to surface contexts, as the upland terrace consists of eroded granite bedrock
with little to no soils present.

recommends no further investigations on this site.

5.5

SITE 41GL368 (AHPA GILLESPIE-14)

General Description
Site 41GL368 is a diffuse prehistoric surficial lithic scatter located in a small valley
between Cedar Mountain and Sagebiel Hill just west of Bernst Creek within AHPA Gillespie-14
(Figure 22). More specifically, the site borders a large improved pasture to the east with
undulating scrub rangeland stretching towards the west. Vegetation within the cleared pipeline
corridor consists of short patchy native grasses with pockets of exposed limestone bedrock
present throughout. Limestone gravels and caliche bedrock consistently cover the ground
surface, allowing for high surface visibility (ca. 85%) throughout much of the site. Soils are
heavily eroded to a point where very little intact sediment remains. Thick stands of mesquite,
juniper, and oak border the periphery of the ROW and a deer blind sits just within the tree line.
A general photograph of site 41GL367 is presented in Figure 23.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41GL368 consist of a sparse scatter of
approximately 20 to 30 pieces of lithic debitage documented on the surface of the site.
Additionally, approximately 5 to 7 burned limestone cobbles were observed clustered
haphazardly in an area bare of vegetation with limestone/caliche bedrock exposed on the
surface. No temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts were encountered during the recording of this
site. A photograph of the observed artifacts on site 41GL368 is presented in Figure 24.
Cultural Features
Although burned rock was documented within the central portion of the site, there is little
evidence to suggest that the burned rocks represent an intact cultural feature. Instead, it is
likely that the rocks were altered by the various modern improvements that have occurred in the
area.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the observed surface scatter, the horizontal extent of site 41GL368 measures
approximately 75.0 m (246.0 ft) east/west. Investigations were not pursued outside of the 15.0m (50.0-ft) wide pipeline ROW; as such, the north/south site boundaries haven not been
formally determined. The western boundary was determined based on the distribution of
surface artifacts and the eastern boundary was found to coincide closely with the local

topography. A marked decrease in artifact densities was noted at the easternmost edge of the
site before it slopes sharply into the improved open pasture.
The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site 41GL368 resides is
entirely restricted to surface contexts, as the landform consists of eroded limestone bedrock
with little to no soils present.
Summary
In general, site 41GL368 is a sparse surficial lithic scatter with the bulk of the cultural
materials found directly on top of exposed limestone bedrock. The close proximity of a deer
blind suggests that the site has likely been looted by hunters, who generally only collect
projectile points. Other substantial impacts associated with the clearing of the corridor and the
installation of the pipeline have no doubt considerably altered the nature of the surface
assemblage that constitutes site 41GL368. As the site possesses no intact buried sediments or
temporally diagnostic artifacts, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41GL368 is considered to be
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon recommends no further investigations on this site.

5.6

SITE 41LL469 (AHPA MASON-1)

General Description
Site 41LL469 is a relatively high-density Middle Archaic open campsite located on the
eastern banks and adjacent upland of Cherry Creek in AHPA Mason-1 (Figure 25). The eastern
portion of the site is located on an upland formation with loamy topsoil underlain by dense
clayey subsoils. The topography slopes off dramatically, creating rocky limestone shelves as
one travels west toward Cherry Creek along the ROW. Exposed limestone bedrock and an
abundance of limestone gravels and cobbles dominate the western portion of the site, allowing
for high surface visibility (ca. 90 to 95%). The eastern half of the site stretches across relatively
flat terrain dominated by patches of short native grasses, with relatively thick stands of oak,
mesquite, and juniper lining the periphery of the ROW. Surface visibility was somewhat lower in
the eastern portion of the site (ca. 85%) due to significantly more ground cover. General
photographs of site 41LL469 are presented in Figures 26 and 27.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41LL469 consist of a relatively dense scatter of
chert flaking debris including large flakes, cores, a diverse assemblage of bifaces, and the base
of a dart point resembling either a re-touched Bulverde dart point or a Langtry dart point.
Artifacts were observed within the 15.0-m (50.0-ft) wide ROW on the surface and within 2
positive shovel tests within an area measuring approximately 130.0 m (427.0 ft) east/west. A
photograph of the sample artifact assemblage from site 41LL469 is presented in Figure 28.

Figure 28. Artifact assemblage observed on site 41LL469
Cultural Features
No intact cultural features were identified during the recording of this site. However, it
should be noted that site 41LL469 was not investigated outside of the previously disturbed
pipeline ROW. As shovel testing within the eastern portion of the site produced evidence of
culture-bearing sediments, it is possible that intact cultural features could be present outside of
the previously disturbed ROW.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the observed scatter, the horizontal extent of the entire site measures
approximately 130.0 m (427.0 ft) east/west. Investigations were not pursued outside of the
15.0-m (50.0-ft) wide pipeline ROW; as such, the north/south boundaries of the site have not
been formally determined. Cherry Creek serves as the western boundary of the site, and the
eastern boundary was delineated based on the distribution of positive and negative shovel tests.
The bulk of the cultural materials were found on the surface, concentrated in 2 primary areas
located in the western portion of the site near Cherry Creek and in the eastern portion of the site
within the ROW. Both of the artifact concentration areas were found to measure approximately
25.0 m (82.0 ft) east/west by 5.0 m (16.4 ft) north/south and coincided closely with the
boundaries of a worn 2-track road located within the southern sector of the pipeline ROW.
The only portion of site 41LL469 where subsurface deposits were found to exist is the
easternmost portion, as the remainder of site consists of eroded limestone bedrock with little to

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 78 Archeological High Probability Areas between the Cedar
Valley and Fort McKavett Pump Stations on the Longhorn Pipeline Right-of-Way

no soils present. Approximately 7 lithic flakes were observed in subsurface contexts in the
eastern portion of the site within 2 shovel tests at depths ranging from 0 to 10 cm below surface
(cmbs). Compact, dense reddish-brown clays were encountered directly below the cultural
zone.
Summary
Site 41LL469 is a Middle Archaic open campsite located on the eastern slopes and
adjacent upland of Cherry Creek. The eastern portion of the site stretches across an upland
formation consisting of loamy topsoil (0 to 10 cmbs) underlain by compact dense clays. The
western portion of the site slopes off dramatically towards Cherry Creek and is dominated by a
steep rocky ridge consisting of eroded limestone shelves covered with limestone gravels and
cobbles. Little to no topsoil was present in this area, thus confining all cultural materials to
surface contexts.
The cultural materials were documented over a 130.0-m (427.0-ft) long area within the
15.0-m (50.0-ft) wide pipeline corridor, with 2 primary artifact concentration areas located at the
polar ends of the site. The recovery of the dart point base, resembling either a Bulverde or
Langtry point, indicates a probable Middle Archaic occupation of the site. However, the nature
of the heavily eroded surface assemblage allows for very little interpretation, as it has become
considerably co-mingled over time. The presence of subsurface artifacts within the eastern
portion of the site (albeit within the upper 10 cm of sediment) indicates that there may be some
potential for intact sediments outside of the previously disturbed pipeline corridor. Given the
recovery of several subsurface artifacts within the eastern portion of the site, there is a
moderate probability for intact deposits on the upland formation north or south of the previously
disturbed pipeline corridor. The eligibility status of site 41LL469 remains undetermined.
Horizon recommends archeological monitoring on this site only if any future maintenance
activities are required within its boundaries in order to determine if intact cultural deposits are
present.

5.7

SITE 41MS79 (AHPA MASON-3)

General Description
Site 41MS79 is located primarily on the steep slopes that flank the eastern edge of
Gersdorf Creek in AHPA Mason-3 (Figure 29). Short grasses interspersed with scrub
vegetation and cactus dominate the actual pipeline ROW. Mesquite, oak, and juniper line the
periphery of the ROW. The steep sandstone slopes at Gersdorf Creek made surface visibility
very high (90 to 98%) within the majority of the site. A prominent hilltop is located directly south
of the site. Soils across the site consist primarily of an extremely thin lens of sediment (0 to 2
cm) in areas capping outcrops of near-surface sandstone bedrock, which effectively confines
cultural materials to surface contexts. The site was not investigated outside of the pipeline
ROW. A general photograph of site 41MS79 is presented in Figure 30.

Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed during the investigation consisted of chert flaking debris,
bifaces, cores, and 1 piece of burned rock observed on the surface of the site. No diagnostic
artifacts or cultural features were encountered during the recording of this site. Artifacts were
found to be evenly dispersed across the landform, with no definable areas of high artifact
concentration noted. No temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts were encountered during the
recording of this site. A photograph of the sample artifact assemblage from site 41MS79 is
presented in Figure 31.
Cultural Features
While abundant sandstone gravels and cobbles were observed covering the surface
within the site boundaries, none of the surface gravels appeared to have been collectively
utilized by aboriginals to facilitate daily activities such as cooking. If prehistoric hearths, or other
similar features, were indeed once employed at this locale, they have likely since been
obliterated by modern clearing episodes. Presently, no evidence of cultural features was
identified during the recording of this site.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the observed surface scatter, the horizontal extent of site 41MS79 measures
approximately 60.0 m (196.9 ft) east/west. Investigations were not pursued outside of the 15.0m (50.0-ft) wide ROW; as such, the north/south boundaries of the site have not been formally
determined. The east/west boundaries were determined based on the distribution of surface
artifacts.
The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site 41MS79 resides is
entirely restricted to surface contexts, as the upland terrace consists of eroded sandstone
bedrock with little to no soils present.
Summary
Site 41MS79 is a surficial lithic scatter located on rocky slopes directly adjacent to
Gersdorf Creek. The bulk of the cultural materials were observed directly on the exposed
sandstone bedrock that slopes dramatically to the west toward Gersdorf Creek, which forms the
western boundary of the site. The eastern boundary was determined based on the presence of
surface artifacts. The site was not investigated outside of the cleared pipeline ROW and, as
such, the northern and southern boundaries of the site have not been fully delineated.
In general, the site consists of a relatively dense scatter of chert flaking debris including
large flakes, cores, a diverse assemblage of bifaces, and 1 piece of burned rock. No diagnostic
artifacts or cultural features were observed during the recording of this site. The cultural

materials were documented within 2 primary artifact concentration areas located in the southcentral and northeastern portions of the site. The nature of the heavily eroded surface
assemblage allows for very little interpretation, as it has become considerably co-mingled over
time. Additionally, a prominent upland formation is located directly south of the pipeline corridor,
and it is likely that the bulk of the cultural materials have washed down from this upland toward
the creek. As the area in general contains little to no topsoil, sheet erosion has had a
considerable effect on the assemblage as a whole. Given the amount of modern disturbances
coupled with the lack of diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, or intact stratified deposits, it is
Horizon’s opinion that site 41MS79 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further
work is warranted.

SITE 41MS80 (AHPA MASON-4)

General Description
Site 41MS80 is a surficial lithic scatter/lithic procurement area located on the edge of a
rolling upland formation in AHPA Mason-4 (Figure 32). The bulk of cultural materials were
observed directly on the exposed limestone bedrock. The western boundary of the site
coincides with a steep rocky ridge, while the eastern boundary was determined based on the
presence of surface artifacts. Surface visibility was consistently high (75 to 95%) throughout the
majority of the site. Short grasses interspersed with scrub vegetation and cactus dominate the
actual pipeline ROW, while mesquite, oak, and juniper line its periphery. A general photograph
of site 41MS80 is presented in Figure 33.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed during the investigation consisted of approximately 50 to
75 lithic flakes, bifaces, and cores observed over a 150.0-m (492.1-ft) long area within the 15.0m (50.0-ft) wide ROW. No diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were encountered during the
recording of this site. Artifacts were found to be evenly dispersed across the landform, although
3 definable areas of high artifact concentration were noted in the southeast, central, and
southwestern portions of the site. A photograph of the sample artifact assemblage from site
41MS80 is presented in Figure 34.
Cultural Features
While abundant limestone gravels and cobbles were observed covering the surface
within the site boundaries, none of the surface gravels appeared to have been collectively
utilized by aboriginals to facilitate daily activities such as cooking. If prehistoric hearths or other
similar features were indeed once employed at this locale, they have likely since been
destroyed. Presently, no evidence of cultural features was identified during the recording of this
site.

The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site 41MS80 resides is

Summary
In general, the site consists of a relatively diffuse scatter of chert flaking debris including
large flakes, several bifaces, and a higher frequency of cores and tested cobbles. No diagnostic
artifacts, burned rock, or cultural features were observed during the recording of this site. The
cultural materials were documented over a 150.0-m (492.1-ft) long area within the 15.0-m (50.0ft) wide ROW, with 3 primary artifact concentration areas located in the southeast, central, and

SITE 41MS81 (AHPA MASON-5)

General Description
Site 41MS81 is a relatively high density Late Archaic open campsite located on a terrace
at the confluence of Squaw Creek and Cedar Hollow in AHPA Mason-5 (see Figure 35). Squaw
Creek in this area is a fairly wide, but shallow waterway flanked by successive limestone
shelves. Squaw Creek serves as the western boundary of the site, while Cedar Hollow forms
the eastern boundary of the site. The terrace on which the site is located is fairly flat and is
defined to the east and west by steep drop-offs into the respective waterways. Limestone
bedrock is present at the surface in some places with small pockets of shallow sandy loam
present throughout. In most cases, the pockets of sediment extended to a depth of 5 cmbs.
Short grasses interspersed with scrub vegetation and cactus dominate the actual pipeline ROW,
while thick stands of mesquite, oak, and juniper line the periphery of the ROW. Surface visibility
was good (ca. 70 to 95%) throughout the site, with visibility decreasing in the northern half of the
ROW due the presence of large limestone boulders piled on top of the pipeline. A general
photograph of site 41MS81 is presented in Figure 36.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

Figure 36. General view of site 41MS81
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41MS81 consist of a relatively dense scatter of
lithic debitage including large flakes, cores, a diverse assemblage of bifaces, 1 point preform,
and 1 dart point that resembles a re-touched Castroville point. Among the surface assemblage,
a higher frequency of tertiary flakes was noted, especially within the central portion of the site.
A photograph of the sample artifact assemblage from site 41LL469 is presented in Figure 37.
Cultural Features
No intact cultural features were encountered during the recording of site 41MS81, which
is not wholly unexpected due to the considerable impacts caused by the installation of the
pipeline in the northern sector of ROW. Presently, a linear rock feature consisting of large
limestone boulders covers the buried pipeline, indicating that a trench had to be blasted out of
pure bedrock in order to install the pipeline. Had any cultural features been present, they were
likely destroyed by original construction activities or by subsequent vehicular traffic and sheet
erosion.

Figure 37. Artifacts observed on site 41MS81
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the observed surface scatter, the horizontal extent of the entire site measures
approximately 120.0 m (394.0 ft) east/west. Investigations were not pursued outside of the
15.0-m (50.0-ft) wide ROW; as such, the north/south boundaries of the site have not been
formally determined. Primary artifact concentration areas were noted in the central and eastern
portions of the site. The site stretches the length of the terrace, with Squaw Creek serving as
the western boundary of the site and Cedar Hollow forming the eastern boundary. Limestone
bedrock was frequently observed at surface with pockets of shallow reddish-brown loam present
throughout. A single shovel test excavated within 1 of these pockets revealed extremely
shallow sediments extending only to 2 cmbs with gravel bedrock encountered directly below.
No cultural materials were encountered within this shovel test.
The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site 41LL469 resides is
entirely restricted to surface contexts, as the site consists of eroded limestone bedrock with little
to no soils present.
Summary
Site 41MS81 is a Late Archaic open campsite located on a terrace at the confluence of
Squaw Creek and its tributary, Cedar Hollow. The site stretches the length of the terrace, with
Squaw Creek serving as the western boundary of the site and Cedar Hollow forming the eastern
boundary. Limestone bedrock was frequently observed at surface with pockets of shallow

reddish-brown loam present throughout. A single shovel test excavated within of these pockets
revealed extremely shallow sediments extending only to 2 cm below the surface. Gravel
bedrock was encountered directly below. The site was not investigated outside of the cleared
pipeline ROW and, as such, the northern and southern boundaries of the site have not been
fully delineated. A rolling upland formation extents north of the pipeline corridor and it is likely
that the site stretches onto this landform.
In general, the site consists of a relatively dense scatter of chert flaking debris including
large flakes, cores, a diverse assemblage of bifaces, 1 point preform, and 1 dart point (possibly
a re-touched Castroville dart point). A high frequency of tertiary flakes was noted among the
surface assemblage. No other diagnostic artifacts, burned rock, or cultural features were
observed during the recording of this site. The cultural materials were observed over a 120.0-m
(394.0-ft) long area within the 15.0-m (50.0-ft) wide pipeline corridor, with 2 primary artifact
concentration areas located in the central and eastern portions of the site. The recovery of the
dart point, resembling a re-touched Castroville dart point, indicates a probable Late Archaic
occupation of the site. However, the nature of the heavily eroded surface assemblage allows
for very little interpretation as it has become considerably co-mingled over time. The location of
the site at the confluence of 2 prominent waterways suggests that it was likely a prime campsite
location, and the relative high frequency of observed tertiary flakes is likely the result of a more
intensive utilization of the site, rather than a short-term localized event. Further investigations
outside of the previously disturbed Longhorn ROW might uncover intact features or components
that could provide significant information regarding the Late Archaic Period in Central Texas.
As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that the site as a whole currently retains an undetermined NRHP
eligibility status. However, the portion of the site within the existing Longhorn ROW consists
solely of surficial cultural deposits resting on shallow soils and exposed bedrock. With this in
mind, it is Horizon’s further opinion that the portion of site 41MS81 within the existing Longhorn
ROW does not contribute to the overall NRHP eligibility status of the site and no further
investigations of this site within the ROW area warranted.

SITE 41KM234 (AHPA MASON-20)

General Description
Site 41KM234 is a surficial lithic scatter that stretches the length of a rolling upland
formation in AHPA Mason-20 (Figure 38). The upland is bordered to the east and west by steep
rocky ridges, which coincide with the eastern and western boundaries of the site. The area in
which site 41KM234 is located is dominated by grasslands interspersed with stands of oak and
juniper trees and scrub vegetation. Limestone bedrock topped by abundant caliche gravels
covers the surface, with little to no topsoil present. Surface visibility was consistently high (75 to
95%) throughout the majority of the site, especially within the confines of the gravel 2-track road
that parallels the southern boundary of the pipeline ROW. A general photograph of site
41KM234 is presented in Figure 39.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

Figure 39. General view of site 41KM234
Observed Cultural Materials
The site consisted of a high density of lithic flakes, bifaces, chunks, and cores observed
on the surface within the pipeline ROW. The majority of cultural materials were found to occur
within the confines of a gravel 2-track road that runs parallel to the pipeline and is located in the
southern half of the cleared corridor. No temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts were encountered
during the recording of this site. A photograph of the sample artifact assemblage from site
41KM234 is presented in Figure 40.
Cultural Features
No intact cultural features were encountered during the recording of this site. Presently,
the entire pipeline ROW has been impacted by pipeline-related activities. Any previously
existing cultural features relating to the surface assemblage were likely destroyed by the
installation of the pipeline in the northern half of the corridor or the 2-track road that occupies
the southern portion of the ROW.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the observed surface scatter, the horizontal extent of site 41KM234 measures
approximately 250.0 m (820.2 ft) east/west. Investigations were not pursued outside of the
15.0-m (50.0-ft) wide ROW; as such, the north/south boundaries of the site have not been
formally determined. The east/west boundaries were determined based on the distribution of
surface artifacts but appeared to coincide closely with the local topography, which slopes off

dramatically on either side of the upland formation. The bulk of the artifacts were observed
within the confines of the 2-track road; however, this is likely due to the increased surface
visibility rather than a notable attribute of the site.
The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site 41KM234 resides is
entirely restricted to surface contexts, as the upland terrace consists of eroded limestone
bedrock with little to no soils present.
Summary
The site is a surficial lithic scatter that stretches the length of a rolling upland formation.
The bulk of cultural materials observed were directly on the exposed limestone bedrock and no
temporally diagnostic artifacts or cultural features encountered. The eastern and western
boundaries of the site were found to coincide closely with the local topography, with artifact
frequencies dropping off dramatically as one traveled east or west from the upland landform.
The site was not investigated outside of the cleared pipeline ROW and, as such, the northern
and southern boundaries of the site have not been fully delineated.
The nature of the heavily eroded surface assemblage allows for very little interpretation,
as it has become considerably co-mingled over time. As the area in general contains little to no
topsoil, sheet erosion has had a considerable effect on the assemblage as a whole. Given the
amount of modern disturbances coupled with the lack of diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, or

intact stratified deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41MS79 is ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and that no further work is warranted.

5.11

SITE 41KM231 (AHPA KIMBLE-2)

General Description
Site 41KM231 is a low density lithic scatter located on the western margin of an
undulating upland formation in AHPA Kimble-2 (Figure 41). Vegetation within the cleared
pipeline corridor consists of short patchy native grasses with pockets of exposed limestone
bedrock present throughout. Limestone gravels and caliche bedrock consistently cover the
ground surface, allowing for high surface visibility (ca. 85%) throughout much of the site. Soils
are heavily eroded to a point where very little intact sediment remains. Thick stands of
mesquite, juniper, and oak border the periphery of the ROW. A general photograph of site
41KM231 is presented in Figure 42.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41KM231 consist of a sparse scatter of
approximately 20 to 25 pieces of lithic debitage and 1 point preform documented on the surface
across the site. No temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts were encountered during the recording
of this site. A photograph of the sample artifact assemblage from site 41KM231 is presented in
Figure 43.
Cultural Features
No intact cultural features were encountered during the recording of this site. Presently,
the entire pipeline ROW has been considerably impacted by pipeline-related activities. Any
previously existing cultural features relating to the surface assemblage have likely been
destroyed by the activities associated with the original construction and subsequent
maintenance of the pipeline.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the observed surface scatter, the horizontal extent of site 41KM231 measures
approximately 50.0 m (164.0 ft) east/west. Investigations were not pursued outside of the 15.0m (50.0-ft) wide ROW; as such, the north/south boundaries of the site have not been formally
determined. The eastern boundary of the site was determined based on the distribution of
surface artifacts, while the western boundary appeared to coincide closely with the local
topography, which slopes dramatically towards the west. No areas of high artifact concentration
were noted, as the artifacts appeared to be evenly scattered across the site.
The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site 41KM231 resides is
entirely restricted to surface contexts, as the upland terrace consists of eroded limestone
bedrock with little to no soils present.

Summary
In general, site 41KM231 is a sparse surficial lithic scatter located on the western margin
of an upland formation. The bulk of cultural materials encountered were directly on top of
exposed limestone bedrock and no areas of high artifact concentration were noted. No
temporally diagnostic artifacts or intact cultural features were documented during the recording
of this site. The nature of the recent impacts associated with the clearing of the corridor and the
installation of the pipeline have no doubt considerably altered the nature of the surface
assemblage that constitutes site 41KM231. As the site possesses no intact buried sediments or
temporally diagnostic artifacts, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41KM231 is ineligible for inclusion
in the NRHP and that no further investigations are warranted.

5.12

SITE 41KM207 (AHPA KIMBLE-5)

General Description
Site 41KM207 is a previously recorded site originally documented by TAS, Inc. in 2002
as a result of a localized survey conducted for Longhorn (Figure 44). The western portion of the
site extended into an area designated as a high probability area and thus was revisited by
Horizon during the current field effort. The site was recorded as a lithic scatter located on a low
upland knoll at the head of several drainage canyons. Non-diagnostic lithic debris was originally
documented across a 100.0 m (328.0 ft) east/west by 300.0 m (984.2 ft) north/south area. In
general, the area is dominated by gently rolling terrain with sparse grass cover within the
pipeline corridor and thick stands of juniper lining the periphery of the ROW. Presently, a 2track gravel road is located within the southern sector of the ROW, allowing for higher surface
visibility within this portion of the ROW. The site recorders indicated that the site was not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and that no further work was recommended.
Horizon revisited the western portion of the site, as it extended into AHPA Kimble-5.
Due to the presence of a diffuse, but steady, continuation of surface artifacts, the western
boundary of site 41KM207 was extended approximately 550.0 m (1804.4 ft). A general
photograph of the site is provided in Figure 45.
Observed Cultural Materials
Upon revisiting site 41KM207, the western boundary was extended approximately 550.0
m (1804.4 ft) due to the presence of a diffuse but steady continuation of surface artifacts such
as lithic flakes, cores, and 1 Darl dart point. Darl dart points are typically attributed to the Late
Archaic II period in Central Texas. Limestone bedrock topped by abundant caliche gravels
consistently covered the ground surface, effectively confining all cultural materials to surface
contexts. A photograph of the sample artifact assemblage from site 41KM207 is presented in
Figure 46.
Cultural Features
No intact cultural features were identified during the recording of this site. As the area
has been intensively cleared in the past, any remnants of cultural features present on the
surface have likely been destroyed.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the observed surface scatter, the horizontal extent of site 41KM207 was
expanded on the western end to include a sparse continuation of surface artifacts that stretched
approximately 550.0 m (1804.4 ft) beyond the previously defined site boundary. As such, the
new dimensions of site 41KM207 measure approximately 650.0 m (2132.4 ft) east/west.
Investigations were not pursued outside of the 15.0-m (50.0-ft) wide ROW; as such, the
north/south boundaries of the site have not been formally determined. The eastern and western
boundaries were determined based on the distribution of surface artifacts.
The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site 41KM233 resides is
entirely restricted to surface contexts, as the terrace consists of eroded limestone bedrock with
little to no soils present.
Summary
Upon revisiting site 41KM207, it was determined that the site extended farther west than
the previously defined site boundary. A diffuse but steady continuation of non-diagnostic lithic
debris and 1 Darl dart point were observed directly on the exposed limestone bedrock surface
within the 15.0-m (50.0-ft) wide ROW. The recovery of a Darl dart point suggests that the site
was occupied at least during the Late Archaic II period. However, as the cultural materials are
distributed across such large area, it is difficult to tell if the severely deflated surface
assemblage represents a cohesive occupation. As the area in general contains little to no
topsoil, sheet erosion has had a considerable effect on the assemblage as a whole. Given the
amount of modern disturbances coupled with the lack of cultural features or intact stratified
deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41KM233 remains ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP
and that no further investigations are warranted on this site.

5.13

SITE 41KM232 (AHPA KIMBLE-7)

General Description
Site 41KM232 is an extensive surficial lithic scatter consisting of 3 primary artifact
concentration areas located on a series of rocky rolling hilltops in AHPA Kimble-7 (Figure 47).
Gentry Creek forms the westernmost boundary of the site, while an unnamed tributary of Gentry
Creek traverses the central portion of the site. Exposed limestone bedrock along with caliche
gravels and chert cobbles consistently covered the surface within the cleared pipeline ROW.
The abundance of naturally occurring chert nodules across a large area likely accounts for the
widespread distribution of lithic artifacts encountered in the area. Surface visibility was
generally high (85%) throughout the site, especially within the confines of a well-traveled 2-track
road that occupied the southern sector of the pipeline ROW. A general photograph of the site is
presented in Figure 48.

Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials on site 41KM232 were observed in 3 primary artifact concentration
areas (A, A1, and A2), each located on the crest of small ridgetops. Artifact densities dropped
off significantly within the lowland areas between the ridgetops, signifying that the boundaries of
the respective concentration areas coincided closely with the local topography.
Observed cultural materials consisted of a variety of lithic debitage ranging from flakes
and chunks to tested cobbles and cores. A Pedernales dart point was recovered from the
surface within the easternmost artifact concentration area (A). No other temporally diagnostic
lithic artifacts were encountered during the recording of this site. A photograph of the sample
artifact assemblage from site 41KM233 is presented in Figure 49, while a photograph of the
observed Pedernales point is presented in Figure 50.
Cultural Features
No intact cultural features were identified during the recording of this site. As the area
has been intensively cleared in the past, any remnants of cultural features present on the
surface have likely been destroyed.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the observed surface scatter, the horizontal extent of the entire site measures
approximately 915.0 m (3001.2 ft) east/west. Investigations were not pursued outside of the
15.0-m (50.0-ft) wide ROW; as such, the north/south boundaries of the site have not been
formally determined. The easternmost artifact concentration area (A) was found to measure
approximately 100.0 m (328.1 ft) east/west. The central artifact concentration area (A1)
measured approximately 50.0 m (164.0 ft) east/west. The westernmost artifact concentration
area (A2) was the smallest, measuring approximately 30.0 m (98.4 ft) east/west. As previously
mentioned, the boundaries for each of the 3 artifact concentration areas were found to coincide
closely with the local topography, with the bulk of cultural materials observed situated on
uplands and a marked decrease in findings in the adjacent lowland areas.
The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site 41KM232 resides is
entirely restricted to surface contexts, as the terrace consists of eroded limestone bedrock with
little to no soils present.
Summary
In general, the site consists of an extensive scatter of chert flaking debris including large
flakes, several bifaces, cores, and 1 Pedernales dart point. No burned rock or cultural features
were observed during the recording of this site. A high abundance of un-modified chert cobbles
were noted among the surface assemblage, suggesting that the area was utilized as a lithic
procurement site. Additionally, given the large area upon which the artifacts are scattered, it
seems prudent to assume that the site could represent a heavily utilized procurement area.
Based on the recovery of a Pedernales dart point on the eastern portion of the site, it would
appear that the site was utilized at least during the Late Archaic I period. However, the nature
of the heavily deflated surface assemblage allows for very little interpretation. As the area in
general contains little to no topsoil, sheet erosion has had a considerable effect on the
assemblage as a whole. Given the amount of modern disturbances coupled with the lack of
intact stratified deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41KM232 is considered to be ineligible
for inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon recommends no further investigations on this site.

SITE 41KM233 (AHPA KIMBLE-10)

General Description
Site 41KM233 is a small surficial lithic scatter/lithic procurement area located on an
upland ridge between 2 unnamed tributaries within AHPA Kimble-10 (Figure 51). The area in
which the site is located consists of gently rolling grassland with stands of oak trees
interspersed throughout. The total lack of juniper and mesquite trees in the area suggests that
the surrounding landscape has been cleared in the recent past, eradicating scrub vegetation
and leaving the oak trees untouched. Surface visibility was consistently high (ca. 90%) across
the site, with cultural materials found intermixed with caliche gravels and a high frequency of
naturally occurring chert cobbles. The location of the pipeline is clearly visible within the cleared
ROW due to the presence of a linear rock pile located in the northern sector of the pipeline

ROW. In such cases, the pipeline trench had to be blasted out of pure bedrock and the
excavated materials were subsequently piled on top of the buried pipeline. The presence of the
linear rock feature indicates that limestone bedrock can consistently be found in near-surface
contexts within the general area. Additionally, the activities involved in the installation of the
pipeline had a noticeable effect on the local chert, as most observed chert cobbles had been
severely shattered. A general photograph of site 41KM233 is presented in Figure 52.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41KM233 consist of a small localized scatter of
lithic debitage, several bifacial tools, and a high frequency of cores and tested cobbles
documented across the surface of the site. No temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts were
encountered during the recording of this site.
Cultural Features
No intact cultural features were identified during the recording of this site. As the area
has been intensively cleared in the past, any remnants of cultural features present on the
surface have likely been destroyed.

Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the observed surface scatter, the horizontal extent of site 41KM233 measures
approximately 30.0 m (98.4 ft) east/west. Investigations were not pursued outside of the 15.0-m
(50.0-ft) wide ROW; as such, the north/south boundaries of the site have not been formally
determined. Surface artifacts were found to be concentrated in a small localized area in the
central portion of the site, with densities dropping off sharply as one traveled away from the
central cluster. The eastern and western boundaries were determined based on the distribution
of surface artifacts.
The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site 41KM233 resides is
entirely restricted to surface contexts, as the terrace consists of eroded limestone bedrock with
little to no soils present.
Summary
In general, the site consists of a relatively dense scatter of chert flaking debris including
large flakes, several bifaces, and a higher frequency of cores and tested cobbles. No diagnostic
artifacts, burned rock, or cultural features were observed during the recording of this site. An
abundance of un-modified chert cobbles was noted among the surface assemblage, suggesting
that the area was utilized as a lithic procurement site. Additionally, given the small localized
area in which the artifacts were concentrated, it seems prudent to assume that the site could
represent a single or short-term procurement event. However, the nature of the heavily deflated
surface assemblage allows for very little interpretation. As the area in general contains little to
no topsoil, sheet erosion has had a considerable effect on the assemblage as a whole. Given
the amount of modern disturbances coupled with the lack of diagnostic artifacts, cultural
features, or intact stratified deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41KM233 is considered to
be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon recommends no further investigations on this
site.

SITE 41SL23 (AHPA SCHLEICHER-1)

General Description
Site 41SL23 is a sparse lithic scatter located on an upland ridge in AHPA Schleicher-1
(Figure 53). The site is located on a gently sloping upland near the west bank of an unnamed
tributary of the North Llano River. Limestone bedrock is exposed in a few areas within the site
boundaries. Very little of the Tarrant association soils remain. The site consists of only a
sparse lithic surface scatter with a total lack of diagnostic materials. A general photograph of
site 41SL23 is presented in Figure 54.
Observed Cultural Materials
The site consisted of approximately 10 to 20 chert flakes located on the ground surface
within the pipeline ROW. Some flakes, obviously prehistoric in origin, were intermixed with
recently shattered, naturally occurring chert cobbles, which were probably crushed during the
installation of the pipeline in the 1950s. No temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts were
encountered during the recording of this site. A photograph of the sample artifact assemblage
from site 41SL23 is presented in Figure 55.

Cultural Features
While abundant limestone gravels and cobbles were observed covering the surface
within the site boundaries, none of the surface gravels appeared to have been collectively
utilized by aboriginals to facilitate daily activities such as cooking. If prehistoric hearths or other
similar features were indeed once employed at this locale, they have likely since been
destroyed. Presently, no evidence of cultural features was identified during the recording of this
site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the observed surface scatter, the horizontal extent of site 41SL23 measures
approximately 50.0 m (164.0 ft) east/west. Investigations were not pursued outside of the 15.0m (50.0-ft) wide ROW; as such, the north/south boundaries of the site have not been formally
determined. The east/west boundaries were determined based on the distribution of surface
artifacts.
The vertical extent of the deposits on the landform on which site 41SL23 resides is
entirely restricted to surface contexts, as the upland terrace consists of eroded limestone
bedrock with little to no soils present.
Summary
In general, the site consists of a relatively sparse scatter of chert flaking debris confined
to the ground surface. No diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were observed during the
recording of this site. As the area in general contains little to no topsoil, sheet erosion has had a
considerable effect on the site as a whole. Given the amount of modern disturbances coupled
with the lack of diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, or intact stratified deposits, it is Horizon’s
opinion that site 41SL23 is considered to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon
recommends no further investigations on this site.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

During the months of May and June 2007, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural
resources survey of 78 AHPAs located between Longhorn’s Cedar Valley and Fort McKavett
pump stations in Hays, Blanco, Gillespie, Llano, Mason, Kimble, Menard, and Schleicher
counties, Texas. Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey on behalf of Longhorn and
Magellan, the contract operator for Longhorn. The investigations along the ROW on privately
held lands were conducted in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA, while the
investigations along the ROW where it crosses Pedernales Falls State Park were conducted in
compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA as well as the Antiquities Code of Texas. The
purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were present within the ROW,
and if so, to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and/or for formal designation as
SALs. The investigations within Pedernales Falls State Park were conducted under TAC Permit
No. 4576.
The intensive cultural resources survey of the 78 AHPAs resulted in the documentation
of 12 newly recorded and 3 previously recorded archeological sites. The 12 newly recorded
sites consist of 11 prehistoric lithic scatters (41BC146, 41GL367, 41GL368, 41KM231,
41KM232, 41KM233, 41KM234, 41LL469, 41MS79, 41MS80, and 41SL23) and 1 prehistoric
open campsite (41MS81). The 3 previously recorded sites consist of 1 prehistoric open
campsite (41GL300) and 2 prehistoric lithic scatters (41KM207 and 41GL301). No sites were
documented within the boundaries of Pedernales Falls State Park during the survey efforts.
Of these 15 sites, site 41LL469 was found to possess the potential for buried deposits.
While cultural materials were recovered from shovel tests on this site, the survey level
investigations were not sufficient to assess the integrity of the cultural deposits. As such, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the NRHP eligibility status of site 41LL469 remains undetermined.
Site 41MS81 was documented as a relatively high density campsite near the confluence
of 2 streams. Construction of the pipeline ROW and erosion have served to strip the portions of
this site within the existing ROW down to bedrock, but uninvestigated portions of this site
beyond the limits of the ROW could conceivably contain intact cultural deposits. As such, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the NRHP eligibility status of site 41MS81 as a whole is undetermined.
However, due to the lack of intact, buried deposits, the portion of this site within the existing
ROW is considered a non-contributing element to any potential NRHP eligibility of the site and
warrants no further investigations.

Chapter 6.0: Summary and Recommendations

The remaining 13 sites (41BC146, 41GL300, 41GL301, 41GL367, 41GL368, 41KM207,
41KM231, 41KM232, 41KM233, 41KM234, 41MS79, 41MS80, and 41SL23) were found to be
nondescript scatters of aboriginal debris on exposed limestone/granite surfaces or within
extremely shallow contexts. As a result, it is Horizon’s professional opinion that neither
significant cultural resources, nor historic properties listed in or eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP), exist within the area of potential effect for any of these 13
project locations and therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for
these 13 sites.

6.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
A summary of all of Horizon’s findings and recommendations is provided in Table 2.

Site 41LL469 is a site along the pipeline ROW where shovel testing investigations
indicated the potential for buried cultural deposits. However, due to the limitations of shovel
testing, the deposits on this site were not thoroughly assessed and the NRHP eligibility status of
the site remains undetermined. Horizon therefore recommends archeological monitoring on site
41LL469 to assess its internal stratigraphy only if and when any maintenance activities are
scheduled within its boundaries. As maintenance activities within the ROW typically consist of
the mechanical excavation of portions of the pipeline requiring inspection or repair, the
monitoring of such trenching investigations would allow for the examination of trench profiles
within the site and the assessment of the cultural deposits, if any, contained therein.
Site 41MS81 is a site possessing a relatively high density of artifacts near the
confluence of 2 streams. Due to the high artifact density and the potential for intact deposits
outside of the existing ROW, its overall NRHP eligibility status is considered to be
undetermined. However, due to the lack of intact, buried deposits, the portion of this site within
the existing ROW is considered to be a non-contributing element to the potential NRHP
eligibility of the site and warrants no further investigations. Horizon therefore recommends that
cultural resources clearance be granted for the portion of site 41MS81 within the confines of the
existing pipeline ROW. However, if any future maintenance is proposed beyond the limits of the
current ROW at this location, the portions of the site beyond the current ROW should be
assessed to determine if intact, buried deposits are present.
The remaining 13 sites documented during the survey efforts were all found to be
situated in erosional settings where shallow soils and exposed bedrock were prevalent, and the
potential for buried, intact cultural deposits was minimal. As a result, it is Horizon’s professional
opinion that neither significant cultural resources, nor historic properties listed in or eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), exist within the area of potential effect
for any of these 13 project locations and therefore recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for these 13 sites.
As for all other locations within the 78 AHPAs where negative findings were produced,
Horizon also recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted. However, in the event
that any human skeletal remains or burial items are encountered during future maintenance
activities within any portion of the 78 AHPAs discussed herein, including previously surveyed
