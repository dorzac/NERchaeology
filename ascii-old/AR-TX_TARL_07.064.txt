1982 and terminating February 8, 1983. The survey located
and recorded thirteen prehistoric and one historic sites.
All sites are within the Cuero I Archeological District.
Two of the prehistoric sites - 41DW247 and 41DW254 - were
tested. Results of this testing indicated that 41DW247 held
some limited potential for the recovery of information on
lowland occupations. Site 41DW254 showed no potential for
significant data recovery.
Monitoring of line clearance
through both sites insured that little or no damage was
inflicted by tree removal or the movement of heavy equipment
across the site.

INTRODUCTION

In April, 1982, the lower Colorado River Authority
(LCRA) sponsored the Texas Archeological Survey (TAS), The
University of Texas at Austin, intensive survey of the
cultural resources in a proposed 32-mile long transmission
corridor connecting the Gonzales and Cuero substations (Fig.
1).
This corridor traverses parts of Gonzales and DeWitt
counties, Texas. A memorandum of agreement between the
Lower Colorado River Authority and the Texas Historical
Commission resulted in the issuance of Antiquities Permit
No. 252 under which the field work was conducted.
The field work schedule was determined by the
acquisition of land by the LCRA. This determining factor
enabled almost everyone on the TAS staff to participate in
this project. Field work was initiated on AprilS, 1982, by
Leland Bement and David Robinson and lasted four days.
The
next segment, July 26 to August 4, was conducted by David
Robinson, Laura Trawick and Don Lloyd and included the
testing of 41DW247.
David Brown. Ann Magennis and Don Llyod were in the
field on August 23 and 24 surveying and testing 41DW254, and
David Robinson and Ulrich Kleinschmidt surveyed two portions
of the corridor September 1.
The final segment was
completed on February 8, 1983, by Leland Bement and Bruce
Nightengale.
Thirteen prehistoric and one historic sites
were located during the survey.
The quarterly scheduling of this survey served as a
test for the ability to recognize sites during different
times of the year. Of course, the major factor for this
experiment is the quality and density of ground cover.
Other key factors include land usage, i.e.
plowing,
harvesting, clearing and the vegetation supported on the
various soil types. The results of this corallary test
reveal that ground cover changes in form but varies little
in density. Early in the Spring the ground was carpeted
with
new growth (Fig.
2a).
Midsummer ground cover
consisted of maturing plants, many of which were in full
bloom (Fig.
2a).
Density was slightly less during late
summer but full maturity of individual plants still obscured
visibility.
Ground cover during the winter consisted of
dead and decomposing plant parts. Winter plowing of fields
provides the only significant lessening of ground cover
density. Thus, for the Gonzales to Cuero area, late winter
is the best time for site recognition.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
The transmission line corridor transects
Eocene
formations in the north and Miocene formations in the south.
From north to south these sandstone formations are the Cook
Mountain (Ecm), Yegua (Ey), Caddell (Eca), Wellban (Ewb) ,
Manning (Em), Whitsett (Eow), Catahoula (Mc), Oakville
Sandstone (Mo) and Fleming (Mf) (Bureau of Economic Geology
1974). Each end of the transmission line crosses the
Guadalupe River and its fluviatile terrace deposits (Qt) and
current floodplain alluvium (Oal). Of geologic interest is
the Oakville
Escarpment
a part of the Kisatchie
Escarpment. This escarpment marks the point at which the
final descent to the Gulf of Mexico begins. The Oakville
formation is the major component of the escarpment in this
section of Texas with the Bordas (Reynosa sandy limestone)
to the west and the Kisatchie (Catahoula) to the east
(Fenneman 1938:110).
The transmission line crosses this
escarpment near the Gonzales-DeWitt county line.
Soil s
Soils within this transmission line corridor include
clay
loams
and clays of the
sand,
sandy
loams,
Sarnosa-Shiner association (SCS 1973).
The upland areas
exhibit soils of all types while the lowland floodplains are
principally clays. A Soil Survey of DeWitt County has been
published but, at present there is no published soil survey
for Gonzales County. However, limited soils information can
be obtained from the USDA office in Gonzales.
Hydrology
The south central Texas area around Gonzales and Cuero
is drained by the numerous streams of the Guadalupe River
system. Four miles west of the town of Gonzales the
Guadalupe River is joined by the San Marcos River from the
north. Continuing down river, the perennial waters of Peach
Creek converge from the north. Then three miles northwest
of Cuero the perennial waters of Sandies Creek join the
Guadalupe.
The majority of the transmission line corridor
traverses the interfluvial uplands between the Guadalupe
River and Sandies Creek.

Page 4
Flora and Fauna
Much of the uplands have been converted to grazing with
some improved pasture of Coastal Bermuda grass. Typical
vegetation of overgrown areas of the uplands
include
hackberry, mesquite, post oak, prickly pear, tasajillo and
numerous prairie grasses. The lowlands and upland stream
banks are overgrown with dense woodlands of elm, ash,
hackberry, post oak and live oak.
This region is a
combination of Gould's (1975:3) Post Oak Savannah and Black
Prairie. Blair (1950) includes this area in his Texan
Province.
Fauna observed by the survey crew includes white tail
deer, skunk, oppossum, armadillo, gophers and other small
rodents, lizards, turtles, snakes and numerous bird species.
Climate
The maximum temperature is reached in July with a high
of 96 degrees F for both Gonzales and DeWitt counties. The
minimum is reached during January with a low of 42 degrees F
for Gonzales and 44 degrees F in DeWitt. A growing season
of 270 days is seen in DeWitt County and 276 days in
Gonzales County. The mean annual rainfall is 33 inches and
32 inches for DeWitt and Gonzales counties respectively.
A11 temperature and ra i nfa 11 data is taken from the Dallas
Morning News Texas Almanac 1980-1981.
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The documentation of archeological
sites within
Gonzales and DeWitt counties is due to the efforts of
amateur archeologists and, more substantially, to surveys
and tests conducted by professional archeologists in
anticipation of water control, mining and transmission line
projects.
Presently, a total of 179 sites are recorded in
Gonzales County and 246 in DeWitt. Of these, 140 Gonzales
County sites and 212 in DeWitt are the result of survey and
testing for the proposed Cuero I reservoir (Fox et a1.
1974) .
The Cuero Reservoir Project enabled archeologists to
survey a large block of land along both banks of the
Guadalupe River which included some upland areas.
Although
only limited testing of a very few sites was accomplished,
this single project provides a basis for an understanding of
the chronology and cultural development within this
transitional zone. Gonzales and DeWitt counties are part of
a transitional zone between the Central Texas, South Texas
and Coastal Texas Prehistoric cultures. This zone exhibits
traits from all of these areas.
On the basis of this

Page 5
project, a chronology was proposed with which additional
work could be compared.
Reports of other scientific
ventures in this two county area include McGraw 1979,
Kenmotsu 1981, Jackson and Dibble 1980, and Hester, Kelly
and Bass 1975.
Chronology
The chronology suggested by Fox et al. (1974) presents
a very broad and basic framework within which further
subdivisions can be made when warranted by sufficient
additional data.
Chronology begins with the Paleoindian
period followed by the Early Archaic, Middle Archaic, Late
Archaic, Neo-American and finally Historic.
Each period, with the exception of the Historic, is
marked by an index fossil artifact which, in this case, is a
projectile point type. It is by the use of identified
projectile point types that the similarities of this area
with those of other Texas cultural regions were discerned.

Until
materials is conducted, no time table can be assigned to
this relative chronology.
At present, only the Central
Texas chronology is sufficiently defined to borrow dates for
those strata bearing comparable projectile point types (see
Weir 1976, Prewitt 1981).
The Historic Period begins with the Spanish contact in
Texas by Cabeza de Vaca. The first settlers in Gonzales and
DeWitt counties were of the DeWitt colony in 1825 (Rather

as the location of the first skirmish between the Anglo
Americans and the Mexican government. This occurred at the
town of Gonzales in 1835 when a troop of Mexican soldiers
demanded the return of a cannon given to the colonists for
protection against the Indians. The townsmen of Gonzales
refused.
This event, plus others, eventually led to the
came
independence and
Texas Revolution after which
statehood.
The Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio
Railroad brought a boom to the town of Cuero which lasted
from 1873 to 1906 when the railroad was extended to San
Antonio (Hester 1975:54).
The DeWitt County court house, Gonzales County court
house, Kennard House and Braches Home have been nominated to
the National Register of Historic Places. As a result of
the Cuero I Reservoir survey and testing, the area along the
Guadalupe River between the towns of Cuero and Gonzales was
also nominated to the National Register of Historic Places.
The Cuero I Archeological District encompasses approximately

Page 6
57,000 acres including over 350 archeological sites of both
Historic and Prehistoric periods.
SURVEY PROCEDURES
The pedestrian survey was accomplished by a crew of two
people, each capable of covering the 70-foot-wide corridor
but usually traveling together with each inspecting half the
width of the corridor. Sites were recorded when found and
additional information obtained from the landowner.
Often
the landowner provided an assessment of cultural resources
on his own property when contacted by the field crew prior
to conducting the survey.
Sites were recorded on Texas Historical Commission site
forms. Recording included description and sketch mapping of
the area and shovel probes.
Other documentation included
black and white and color photographs and plotting on USGS
7.5 minute topographic maps and the areal mosaic plan and
profile maps provided by the LCRA. All research materials
generated by this project are curated at
the
Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), The University of
Texas at Austin.
To aid in the assessment of these sites, two sites
received limited testing. At site 41DW247 an 1 x 2 m test
pit was dug by David Robinson and is discussed later in this
report.
Site 41DW254 received extensive shovel probing and
was surface collected.
Each site report was submitted to TARL for assignment
of a permanent number following the trinomial system. This
system is comprised of a number designating the state (Texas
is 41), a letter designation for the county (Gonzales - GZ,
DeWitt - OW), and a number reflecting how many sites have
been recorded in that particular county. Thus 41GZ140 is
the 140th site located in Gonzales County, Texas.
RESULTS OF THE SURVEY

The survey resulted in the identification and recording
of thirteen prehistoric sites and one historic site (Fig.
1). All of these are within the bounds of the CUero I
Archeological District as set by the National Register of
Historic Places.
These sites, therefore, are already
determined to be of National Register quality and will
automatically be added to the list of sites within the
District.
However, none were considered to warrant a
request for State Archeological Landmark designations.

Page 7
Of the thirteen prehistoric sites
recorded,
two
required
limited
testing procedures to aid in their
evaluation. The 1 x 2 m test pit at 41DW247 showed that the
site was a campsite, probably situated to best utilize the
lithic resources in the area. Site 41DW254 was determined
to be a lithic reduction locale with possible short term
camping on the basis of shovel tests and collecting.
The
historic site and the prehistoric sites, with the limited
testing of 41DW247 and 41DW254 completed,
are
not
recommended
for
further assessment.
Clearing of the
right-of-way near and around these sites was
usually
monitored by an archeologist and is not reported to have
been detrimental to the sites.
Any cultural materials
uncovered during the tower placement and construction phase
of this transmission line should be reported immediately to
the Texas Historical Commission and the Texas Archeological
Survey_
SITE DESCRIPTIONS
Prehistoric Sites

41GZ183
The site is an exposure of flakes and burned rock on a
slight rise on the south side of an unnamed tributary. The
soil is a sandy to sandy clay loam to a depth of at least 25
cm. All of the cultural material was found in this matrix.
The site's location near an intermittent water supply
and the presence of burned rock suggest a short term
campsite, probably related to lithic procurement/reduction
activities.
No time diagnostic artifacts were found. Only
a portion of the site is in the corridor and its size is
unknown.
Numerous gopher holes and the burrow of a larger
animal, possibly an armadillo, make it unlikely that intact
cultural features could be found. This, combined with the
site's location on the outskirts of the transmission
corridor, leads to the recommendation that no further
assessment need be made at this location.
41GZ184
Located on the north slopes of an unnamed tributary to
Denton Creek, this site (Fig. 2a) consists mainly of the
exposed petrified wood cobbles of the Manning Formation.
Many of these have been tested and a few have multiple flake
removal scars. Few flakes were noticed on the surface.
No
other signs of cultural debris were found on or below the
surface.
This site shows the aboriginal use of the
hard-to-work petrified wood resource which has only a slight
exposure in this area. The site is approximately 30 x 30 m.

Page 8
A surface collection was made; Table 1 categorizes this
material.
The site's use is restricted to quarrying
activities. No further work is recommended for this site.

41DW247
This site is located on the south side of an
intermittent stream which cuts the first terrace of the
Guadalupe River.
The terrace consists of
Pleistocene
alluvial gravels of chert, petrified wood and quartzite.
The site is in a compacted sandy loam matrix which ;s
underlain by the gravels. Cultural material exposed in an
area 15 x 15 m includes burned rock, flakes and one Tortugas
dart point. In order to gain a better understanding of this
site's extent and integrity, a 1 x 2 m test pit was
excavated.
The results of this test are given by David
Robinson later in this report.
The area surrounding this site has been subjected to
gravel quarrying operations since the 19305 which probably
destroyed a large portion of the site or sites in the same
geographical setting.
This site was probably a short term
campsite with lithic procurement and reduction among its
prime uses. In view of the results of the limited testing,
no further work is recommended for this site.
41DW248
This site is located on a detached terrace remnant to
the north of a small intermittent tributary of the Guadalupe
River.
The terrace remnant is comprised of small to

medium-sized river cobbles capped with sandy loam. Lithic
reduction debris is eroding from the sides of the remnant
and
in
the backdirt of gopher holes over an area
approximately 30 x 20 m. No burned rock or other evidence
of occupational
features
were
noted.
The site is
interpreted as a lithic procurement/reduction locus.
No
further work is recommended.
41DW249
The site is located on a 10% grade hillside to the
north of the main stem of Willow Branch. The soil here is a
gray, very fine sandy loam to a depth of at least 60 cm.
Cultural material, consisting of small cobble cores and
numerous flakes, ;s concentrated near the surface with some
material
distributed
to
lower
levels
probably by
bioturbation. Gopher hole backdirt revealed some cultural
material, and also illustrated the culprit for bioturbation.
Untested or unmodified small chert and quartzite cobbles
were also present on the hillside. This site is most likely
a lithic procurement/reduction station.
Site area
;s
approximated at 75 x 150 m.
No additional work is
recommended for this site.
4IDW250
This site is located on the upper slope of a ridge to
the south of the main fork of Willow Branch. This slope is
covered by a fine gray sandy loam to an unknown depth.
In
an area approximately 50 x 50 m, lithic reduction debris was
exposed in the backdirt of gopher holes.
Unmodified small
chert cobbles were also present leading to the conclusion
that this area was used as a lithic procurement/reduction
site.
No material suggestive of a cultural feature was
observed, nor was any uncovered in a shovel
probe.
Bioturbation
by gophers and the hill slope location
minimizes the chances for the intact existence of features.
This, with the sparsity of cultural material, is the basis
for not recommending this site for any further assessment.
4IDW252
This site is located on a small flat beneath the crest
of a ridge at the head of an unnamed tributary to Willow
Branch. The soil is a light brown sandy loam of unknown
depth.
The area is pock-marked by gopher holes. A light
scatter of flakes was observed on the surface of an area
approximately 20 x 25 m.
No material suggestive of a
feature was observed. This is probably an isolated area of
light
lithic reduction activity.
No further work is
recommended at this site.

Page 10
41DW253
This site is located on the crest and eastern slopes of
a hill.
The crest and hillside are peppered with chert
cobbles, cores and flakes for an area approximately 200 x
200 m.
Chert cobbles with occasional flakes and cores
identify this as a lithic procurement/reduction loci.
No
evidence of short or long term camping debris was noted. No
diagnostic tool forms were found precluding any statements
as to the site's usage through time. No further work is
recommended for this site.
4IDW254
This site is located along the north bank of an unnamed
tributary to Fulcher Creek (Fig. 2a). In an area 50 x 50 m
is a scatter of cultural debris consisting of flakes, cores
and crude bifaces (Fig. 3). Shovel probes into the area
revealed only flakes to a depth of 25 cm; there was no
evidence of any cultural features. Activity at this site
seems to have centered around lithic reduction. The lack of
any Significant numbers of unmodified cobbles suggests that
lithic procurement was taking place elsewhere and that
tested materials were being transported to this site for
reduction. The limited testing of 41DW254 resulted in the
recovery
and collection of a light amount of lithic
materials (Table 2). The dart point is a non-diagnostic
projectile The blade has been reworked by bevell-ing on the
right edges. The lateral edges of the blade are straight.
The shoulders are square, resulting from side notches. The
lateral edge of the base slightly contracts while the base
slightly concaves. The shoulders and base edge on one side
of the projectile are missing. The projectile is made from
tan
chert.
Both surfaces are highly patinated.
The
projectile is 4.2 cm long, 2.1 cm wide, and 0.6 cm thick.
In addition to lithic cultural materials, one fragment
of a probable deer rib was found in the cut bank of the
drainage. No other material was located in its vicinity.
The extensive shovel tests for this site, however, failed to
reveal any evidence for short or long term
camping.
Possibly the material is being washed in from a site outside
the study area. No further work is recommended at this
site.
4-1DW255
This site is located along the banks of a northeast
flowing tributary to Fulcher Creek. The soil is a dark gray
fine sandy loam to a depth of at least 60 cm.
On the
surface of an area approximately 150 x 25 m are exposed
medium-to-large-sized flakes. No cores were exposed.
A
shovel probe to a depth of 60 cm revealed no additional

cultural material.
There is no evidence of cultural
features in either the shovel test or the banks of the small
tributary. This site is probably a lithic workshop area.
No further work is recommended.
4IDW256

This site ;s located on the gently sloping hillside to
the west of a small unnamed tributary to Fulcher Creek. The
site consists of a surface scatter of flakes and burned
flakes over an area of 50 x 50 m. Two shovel tests revealed
that cultural remains were restricted to the surface.
Erosion of the hillside and flooding of the unnamed
tributary has probably transported the site's materials
downstream. No further work is recommended for this site.
41DW257

This site is located on the first terrace above the
Guadalupe River floodplain, around and in an intermittently
worked caliche quarry. The original site surface was an
approximately 40 cm thick soil horizon of sandy clay loam,
now limited in coverage to the edges of the quarry.
This
soil
horizon
is underlain by at least 5 meters of

Page 13
alternating and interbedded Pleistocene
river gravels
(chert,
quartzite
and
silicified wood), and caliche
outcropping in the quarry walls.
Lithic flaking debris,
mussel shell, and burned rock are found in moderate to high
densities (25 to 50 items/m2) on the soil horizon at the
edge of the pit, and in low densities on the edges and
bottom of the pit. From this distribution, it is probable
that most of the cultural material of the site is contained
in the soil horizon, but calichified bones in the collection
of Fred Zentner, the site1s owner, signal possible cultural
horizons in the lower gravel and caliche strata. Artifacts,
all in the collection of Fred Zentner, include a possibly
Paleoindian lanceolate point, a Clear Fork gouge, several
Archaic dart points, and a small serrated Late Prehistoric
projectile point. Four calichified fragments of mammalian
long bones are also found in the collection. The site has
suffered extensive disturbance by quarrying, but it may
contain stratified cultural zones on the quarry peripheries
or within the pits. The site lies outside the transmission
corridor and was
recorded during volitional survey,
after-hours, following receipt of site information from Fred
Zentner.
Accordingly, site recommendations are not made,
but further scientific investigations are well warranted due
to the site1s time-depth, stratification, and abundance of
cultural material.
Historic Sites
41GZ185

The only historic site located in this survey is on the
Walter Dexter Tucker property.
The site ;s now only the
remains of the cut limestone blocks used as a foundation,
bricks used to line a flower bed, an old wagon frame and a
slab lined hand dug well. The well is the only part of the
site to be affected by the transmission line. According to
Mr. Quinney, a friend of Mr. Tucker, he helped move the
house in the 1960 15. Mr. Quinney said the house was not
very old, probably built in the 1930's.
The well is enshrouded by a large mesquite tree and
should be hand cleared. The remainder of the site is off
the right-of-way. No further work is recommended for this
site.

ARCHEOLOGICAL TESTING AT 41DW247
David G. Robinson
A program of test excavation was conducted at 41DW247
(Fig.
4) on August 3 and 4, 1982. The objective of the
excavation was to define the site more accurately than
possible in the initial surface survey. The excavations
were necessary to devise recommendations for the avoidance
of adverse impacts to the site. David G. Robinson and Don
Lloyd of the TAS' staff dug the test unit.
The objective of the testing program was met by the
excavation of a 1" ~ 2 m test pit in the area of greatest
surface artifact density. It was thought that an excavation
unit
so
placed would yield an artifact assemblage
representative of the entire site, expose the
site1s
cultural stratigraphy, and perhaps uncover intact features
such as a fire hearth or burial. The initial survey defined
the site as a light artifact and burned rock scatter in an
area of darker, possibly carbonized, soil.
This surface
observation suggested the site might have been a quarry site
at which considerable amounts of firemaking and possibly
chert heat-treating activities were conducted through time.
An artifact collection and a stratification of the site
would shed light on this tentative interpretation and guide
protective recommendations.
After the specific point on the site to be excavated
was selected, the test excavation unit was positioned and
oriented to magnetic north with the aid of a Brunton
compass.
Horizontal control of artifacts and features was
maintained by the technique of triangulating points in the
excavation unit from any two excavation unit corner stakes.
Vertical control was maintained by measurements below a
level line stretched from the northeast corner stake, which
also served as the site datum.
Results

The testing program at 41DW247 resulted
in
the
excavation of a pit 30 cm deep and the collection of 128
cultural or possibly cultural items. Cultural features were
lacking in the pit, which showed a largely natural soil
profile, and recovered materials suggested a limited range
of activities conducted at the site. Final recommendations
follow directly from these findings.
The fill and profile of the test pit showed two strata
in horizontal layering, with a distinct wavy boundary
between them (Fig. 5). The upper layer consisted of an
extremely compacted dark grayish brown sandy loam, with

average, and the bottom 10 em had a notably higher clay
content than the upper parts of the layer. This lower
portion also displayed pronounced columnar structure and sat
directly on the lower gravelly stratum. Except for the
small chert pebbles, there appeared to be little mixing of
materials between the two strata. The lower stratum was a
medium yellowish brown extremely pebbly and gravelly loamy
sand, with weak granular or massive structure and tree
roots. The gravels were found in a range of sizes up to
about 8 inches in diameter. This stratum included the same
material as the commercial gravel pits located all around
the site.
Additionally, the stratum contained a few melon
sized pockets of light yellowish brown clay.
This zone
continued to the bottom of the excavation unit, below the
cultural level of the site.
The site lies on an area of mapped Silvern-Ellen
complex soils (SCS 1978), and, with the notable exceptions
of s011 color and the columnar structure of the lower
portion of the upper stratum, the soils exposed in the test
pit and its profile conform well to the description of the
A-II and A-I2 subhorizons of the Silvern series. The
Silvern series of very gravelly sandy soils generally formed
in ancient stream terraces or delta deposits of sand and
gravel. The A-II horizon is described as about 25 em thick,
and consists of a light brownish gray very gravelly loamy
sand with fine granular structure, fine and very fine roots,
and clear smooth boundary (SCS 1978:29-30).
The A-I2
horizon extends from 25 cm to over 50 em below the surface
and consists of a pinkish gray, very gravelly loamy sand
with fine granular structure, fine roots, 51% well-graded
siliceous pebbles, 27% cobbles and a clear smooth boundary
(ibid.).
The test pit soil profile varied from this published
description in having fewer gravels in the A-II horizon and
massive structure in the A-12 horizon instead of granular
structure.
Most importantly, the A-II horizon of the test
pit had a much darker color than that in the published
description.
In addition to the differences in color
description, it was observed in the field that the surface
soil (A-II horizon) was much darker than exposed topsoil in
nearby areas off the site.
It is felt that this color

Page 18
difference is culturally derived, probably from charcoal
produced in aboriginal campfires. Although charcoal chunks
or flecks were
not observed
in
the excavations,
environmental factors may have distributed carbon from
campfires through the A-II horizon, with the darker color
the result.
The major find at the site was the Tortugas point (Fig.
6a) recovered from rodent spoil dirt during the initial
visit to the site. The excavation program yielded two chert
cores (Fig.
6b.c) and a number of burned and unburned
lithic items, a total of 128 cultural specimens (Table 3)
including the projectile point recovered from the surface.
Table 3 shows clearly the preponderance of burned items over
unburned
items and the vastly richer distribution of
cultural items in the A-II horizon than in the underlying
gravels, or A-12 horizon. It was noted during excavation,
too, that artifacts in the lower horizon were restricted to
the upper five centimeters of the gravels and that the lower
portions were devoid of artifacts.
It is reasonable to
presume that artifacts in the lower stratum were mixed into
that stratum by soil formation processes, and that the upper
loamy stratum is the single zone of cultural activities and
deposit on the site.

unburned tertiary chert flakes numerically dominate the
assemblage, but primary and secondary flakes, burned and
unburned, are also present.
The cultural and natural evidence gathered by the
testing program suggests that 41DW247 functioned as a quarry
and workshop site where chert cobbles were acquired and
worked into finished or semi-finished form. The atypically
dark upper soil stratum and the large proportion of burned
flakes, spalls and culturally unmodified rocks demonstrate
the former existence of campfires. Neither the cores nor
the projectile point were of heat-treated chert, so it
cannot be stated conclusively that fires burned solely for
the purpose of heat treatment of chert. The single temporal
diagnostic artifact, the Tortugas point, positions the site
in the Early Archaic at the earliest; the test pit yielded
no specimens for radiocarbon dating. The site may have been
repetitively visited for an unknown period for the purpose
of chert procurement and tool manufacturing, and it may have
numbered as one of a large number of sites on the river
terrace which provided lithic resources, fuel and easy
access to the river. The site is restricted to the upper
soil layer, and the removal of this layer from
the
surrounding gravel pits has doubtlessly destroyed a large
number of similar sites on this gravel terrace of the
Guadalupe
River.
The type of limited activity site
represented by 41DW247 was probably common
in
this
microenvironment (Fig.
6d) within the larger area before
the beginning of modern land-altering development.

advanced surface modification of the terrace in the form of
gravel quarrying, which has obscured or destroyed other
sites over a large area of the terrace.
41DW247 thus
provides locally scarce information of use in reconstructing
prehistoric economy, seasonality and settlement patterns.
The site has National Register potential, but is already
located in the Cuero I Archeological District, and so joins
a long list of prehistoric sites under that designation.
The projected impact to the site was bulldozer clearing
of trees and travel along the transmission corridor by heavy
vehicles. Transmission towers were not slated to be placed
on the site. Vehicular impact to the site will be minimal
due to the hard, compacted nature of the topsoil. Uprooting

Page 21
of trees may mix artifacts, but the test excavation failed
to establish the presence or likelihood of intact cultural
features or artifact patterns.
It could not be argued
therefore, that tree removal
would obscure artifact
patterning or features. It was recommended, however, that
tree removal proceed with due caution lest a unique
situation
unanticipated
by the
testing
program be
encountered. Vehicular traffic may proceed up and down the
line with as little deviation from a single track as
possible. Monitoring of corridor clearance insured that
little damage was inflicted on the site by the limited tree
removal and movement of heavy equipment.
