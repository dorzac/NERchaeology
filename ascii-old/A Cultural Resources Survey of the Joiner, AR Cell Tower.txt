August 2014

Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint and access entryway of a
proposed cellular tower site in south Mississippi County, Arkansas. The Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking. No Antiquities Permit was required,
but subsequent review of this archeological report was provided by the Arkansas State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO). The total area to be impacted is 6,400 square feet (<0.15 acres).
Files searches at the Arkansas Archeological Survey in Fayetteville revealed that although eight
archeological sites had been documented within two kilometers of the proposed tower site, none
were within close proximity. Files searches at the SHPO in Little Rock revealed that although the
general locale of one historic structure (MS100) had been recorded within the tower’s visual Area
of Potential Effect (APE), it was torn down long before 1971, and as such is not eligible for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on July 26, 2014. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before six shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface, or in any of the six shovel tests. As such, Tierras Antiguas
Archaeology recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to oversee development of the tract
as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that if any previously undiscovered
cultural resources were encountered during development, work should immediately be halted in
the vicinity until such finds could be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any
qualified archeological consultant, and by the Arkansas SHPO.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

Introduction
AARCHER, Inc. is the consulting firm employed to acquire clearance for the erection of the
Joiner Celluar Tower to be constructed in south Mississippi County, Arkansas (Figures 1-3), and
hereinafter occasionally referred to as the Project Area (PA). AARCHER contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct an archeological investigation of the
proposed tower site and access right-of-way. Although no public funding was involved in the
proposed development of the property, the Federal Communications Commission’s Nationwide
Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural resources survey be
conducted prior to such an undertaking.

In July 2014, TAAI conducted a review of cultural resources documented either on, or within
two kilometers of the PA, as well as other documents that may be relative for significant cultural
resources to exist within the PA. The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Arkansas archeological and historic site files in both Little Rock and
Fayetteville to identify what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what
archeological and historic sites have been documented within two kilometers of the PA
3) A search of various websites that offer old maps of the PA
4) A literature review of both published and unpublished reports and manuscripts that describe
the types of archeological sites that have been documented, and thus provide insight as to the
types of sites that may be expected either in the PA, or immediately adjacent to it
6) A review of local soils maps in order to evaluate the potential for intact and buried cultural
materials either within or immediately adjacent to the PA. The proposed cell tower site is located
in a relatively undeveloped area of Joiner, surrounded by an agricultural field, an auto parts store,
and housing.

Project Environment
Physiography, Hydrology, Climate, and Lithic Resources
The Project Area lies within southern Mississippi County, in the Mississippi River Alluvial Plain
physiographic region of Arkansas. The Mississippi River Alluvial Plain follows the Mississippi
River basin, and stretches from Illinois, through Missouri, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee,
through the eastern portion of Arkansas, and south through Louisiana to the Gulf of Mexico.
Several million years ago, eastern Arkansas was under sea water from a northern extension of the
Gulf of Mexico. During the Pleistocene, over thousands of years, ancient rivers such as the
Mississippi, Ohio, and Arkansas carved into the receding seabed. These erosional and depositional
processes continue even today. Old and young Pleistocene-aged terraces cover most of the
Mississippi Delta north of the Arkansas River. The Mississipi River courses through a rift in the
North American continent, and separation of the continent along that rift continues. Most
recently, geologic activity caused the New Madrid earthquakes in 1811-1812, some of the most
powerful quakes ever recorded in North America (Eppley 1965; Foti 2014).
The county’s eastern boundary is formed by the Mississippi River. The county is made up of
nearly level Mississippi Basin alluvial deposits, with elevations varying from 50 to 100 feet
throughout the county. The soils are rich in nutrients and are naturally fit for farming, with
wooded native vegetation still extant along the few shallow streams. The modern climate in the
Project Area is manifested by very warm and relatively long summers driven primarily from moist,
4

tropical air moving north from the Gulf of Mexico. The average daily maximum temperature in
Summer is 900F. Winters on the other hand, are relatively short, with rare, intensive cold snaps.
The average daily minimum temperature in Winter is 340F. The average annual precipitation in
Mississippi County is just under 48 inches, but interspersed with periodic droughts (Ferguson and
Gray 1971).

Lithic Resources
The lowlands portion of the Mississippi River Alluvial plain are relatively void of lithic resources.
However, the nearby Ozark Highlands and Crowley’s Ridge to the east would have provided
abundant outcrops of chert, quartzite, and sandstone (Morse and Million 1980).

Cultural Chronology
The location of the Joiner Celluar Tower survey area presumes cultural affinities indigenous to
the Central Mississippi Valley Archeological Region. Several scholars have offered sound but
differing arguments for cultural chronologies for the region, however the cultural chronology,
defined by periods (in lieu of the terms phase, interval, or horizon) of the region has been
synthesized by Haag (1961), Willey and Sabloff (1974), Anderson et al. (1989), and Morrow et
al. (2002). The following discussions are primarily derived from their syntheses, and a summation
is presented in Table 1.

Pre-Clovis
Although humans may have inhabited the landscape before 12,000 B.P, solid evidence does not
6

yet support their existence. As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to
yield solid stratigraphic proof of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find
earlier occupations on stable landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture?
The Gault Site in Bell County, Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of
North America, and with artifacts stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely
has the best chances of providing conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture (Adavasio and
Page 2002:292-294; Collins and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014). In Arkansas, no evidence has
thus far been found of a pre-Clovis occupation. Although, a possible exception but not as yet
proven conclusive, is the discovery of a Sandia-like biface discovered with probable elephant
remains at the Albertson Shelter in Dallas County (Dickson 1991).
Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. The diagnostic artifact most
associated with this period is the fluted Clovis projectile point. Other artifacts associated with the
Clovis culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone
bolas, ochre, and shaft straighteners. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type points across
most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of the people
who made them.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). By far, the most robust collection of
Paleindian artifacts in North America has been recovered at the Gault Site in Bell County, Texas.
Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian artifacts have been recovered, with only
about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far (Gault Site 2014).
Although Clovis points have been widely documented in the Central Mississippi Valley
Archeological Region of Arkansas, they occur as isolated finds on the surface along the major
river systems in the region, such as the Black River, St. Francis River, and cache River (Anderson
et al. 1989; Jeter and Williams 1989). McNutt (1996) posits that it is quite likely that any
Paleoindian occupation sites in the Central Valley of the region have been destroyed by scouring
caused by a meandering Mississippi River over several millennia. Nevertheless, the archeological
record available for this period indicates that snub-nosed scrapers, end scrapers, chipped stone
knives, drills, and gravers are often discovered in association with fluted Clovis, Cumberland,
Agate Basin, and Coldwater point locales (Chapman 1975; Morse and Morse 1983; 2009).
In the Western and Eastern lowlands of the region, these fluted point types have been
documented in geographical ‘clusters’, to include southeastern Missouri, the northern portion of
Crowley’s Ridge, and in the Black and Current River valleys (Chapman 1975; House 1975; Price
7

and Krakker 1975; Morse 1982). In Arkansas, a transitional complex of artifacts with dart points
called “Dalton” are present (e.g. Goodyear 1974).
Dalton Period
As the warming that marks the transition from Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene climates began
to take effect in Arkansas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic
shift is also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant
bison (Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were either extinct or otherwise
extricated from the region. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer and other
medium-size, or smaller game. Dalton projectile points are found on sites dating to this timeframe.
Some researchers (e.g., Story et al. 1990) suggest that the Dalton point is a transitional point that
developed from eastern Clovis cultures.
Also found on Dalton sites in Arkansas are stone adzes and ground stones, suggesting a heavier
reliance of plants for subsistence (Goodyear 1974; McMillan 1971). Despite significant Dalton
components documented at sites such as the Ferguson Site (3HE63) and Coon Island (3BR10),
settlement patterns are still not well understood (Schambach and Early 1982). Nevertheless,
Dalton components are not all that uncommon in the Mississippi Valley Archeological Region,
where even 21 years ago, close to 1,000 Dalton period sites had been documented (Morse and
Morse 1983). A few of the more significant sites excavated in the Western Lowlands that have
provided a baseline for Dalton period research include the Brand, Sloan, and Lace Place sites
(Morse and Morse 1983).
In the Central Mississippi Valey Region, Morse and Morse (1983) surmise that Dalton culture
peoples were organized in banded groups tethered to major rivers, but also possibly restricted to
fixed territories where they established both permanent base camps and seasonal/temporary
hunting camps spread across a wide area (Schiffer 1975; Goodyear 1974; Redfield and Moselage
1970). Notably, evidence of a more permanent and societal structure could be apparent at the
Sloan Site, where archeologists uncovered remains that may have been a formal Dalton period
cemetery (Morse 1982).
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic in the Central Mississippi Valley Archeological Region of Arkansas is
approximated at 7800-5000 B. C. The extinction of large herds of megafauna and the changing
climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral change by prehistoric inhabitants.
While the basic hunter-gatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from
big game hunting was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources such
as deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts,
fire-cracked rock cooking features, and more specialized tools (Turner et al. 2011). Weir (1976)
speculates that Early Archaic groups were small and highly mobile, an inference from the fact that
Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed and that diagnostic types are seen across a wide area.
Story (1985), however, believes that population densities were low during this period, and that
groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with “few constraints on their mobility”
(Story 1985:39).

Admittedly, the Early Archaic period in the Central Mississippi Valley Archeological Region of
Arkansas is perhaps the most poorly understood of all prehistoric periods. Nevertheless, limited
research suggests that the population during this period consisted of highly mobile foraging
groups exploiting a broad variety of both plants and animals (Anderson et al. (1989). Diagnostic
projectile points include San Patrice, St. Charles, Hardin, Kirk Serrated, Palmer, Beaver Lake,
Rice Lobed, Graham Cove Notched, and Cache River Side Notched (Chapman 1975; Morse and
Morse 1983).
The relatively smaller San Patrice point is a Dalton point variant style whose range extends from
the Rocky Mountains to the south Atlantic coast (Turner et al. 2011). San Patrice points have
been found in northwest Arkansas, the Little Rock area, and extending into the southwest
Missouri area (Dickson 1991). Not infrequently, Albany scrapers are also discovered in San
Patrice components. These are thought to be either hafted spokeshaves or beveled scrapers
fashioned from re-worked projectile points (Turner et al. 2011).
The warming climate toward the end of the Early Archaic caused many streams to dry up, and
prairie-land vegetation expanded as oak-savanna areas decreased in size. This presumably caused
humans into a greater reliance on the remaining riverine environs in order to exploit aquatic fish
and turtles. This then, marks a somewhat blurred transition to the Middle Archaic Period in
Arkansas.
Middle Archaic
The Central Mississippi Valley Middle Archaic period, as influenced from changes in climate and
manifested by changes in subsistence strategies, is generally recognized as the period between
5000–3000 BC. However, once again, this period in the region is very poorly understood, and
much of the inferences about human occupation in the region have to be likened to the
surrounding regions. Some researchers posit that there appears to have been a general shift in
settlement patterns from the lowlands to the Ozark Uplands, influenced by a climatic
Hypsithermal which transitioned the lowland forests into prairie grasslands (Morse and Morse
1983). However, others disagree. In the lowlands of Tennessee, a relatively large Middle Archaic
site was examined on the Duck River floodplain (Prescott 1978), while extensive and repeated
buried occupations were discerned in floodplain sediments in western Kentucky (Nance 1987).
Therefore, Anderson and others (1989) surmise that as yet undiscovered, but possibly intact
Middle Archaic components in the Central Mississippi Valley, and eastern and northeastern
Arkansas, are likely buried in the floodplains.
Late Archaic
The beginning of the Late Archaic marked a transition from a warmer, drier climate to one we
know more today, with increased moisture, relatively fewer open grasslands, and a concurrent
increase in woodlands (Sabo et al. 1988). Of significance, is the ‘possible’ introduction of
domesticated plants and some degree of horticultural or agricultural practices. Although no
evidence of early plant domestication has as yet been discovered in Arkansas, King (1980) reports
on squash and gourd domestication at the Phillips Spring Site in western Missouri. However,
toward the end of the Late Archaic, it may be that sumpweeds, sunflowers, goosefoot, and
9

possibly maygrass and ragweed had been domesticated and were included as part of the
subsistence base (Ford 1985).
A marked in increase in population increase in the Central Mississippi Valley and surrounding
regions at this time is manifested in a more robust archeological database, such that two
subperiod cultures have been defined: Big Creek (ca. 3000-2000 BC), Burkett (ca. 3000-2000
BC). A third subperiod culture is Weems (ca. 1000-500 BC), which appears to have been a
transitional culture or horizon into the Early Woodland period (Morse and Morse 1983; 2009).
Two defined phases within the Late Archaic are the Frierson phase identified at the Frierson site
in the Arkansas Western Lowlands (Morse 1982) and the O’Brian’s Ridge phase in southeast
Missouri (Williams 1954).
Artifact assemblages in Late Archaic components consist of bannerstones, steatite vessels,
polished axes, and an assortment of baked clay pieces. Late Archaic diagnostic projectile point
types found in southeast Missouri include Burkett, Weems, Etley Stemmed, Smith Basal Notched,
Table Rock Stemmed, Stone Square Stemmed, and a variety of unnnamed stemmed and cornernotched points (Chapman 1975). In northeast Arkansas, point types include Gary, Table Rock
Stemmed, Burkett, and Big Creek. The wide distribution of Gary points in northeast Texas,
western Louisiana, and into northeast Arkansas for example (Chapman 1975; Turner et al. 2011),
suggest an extensive distribution of population and cultural technology adaptations across a broad
expanse. In some respects, the baked clay pieces discovered suggest a possible affiliation with the
Poverty Point complex in Louisiana, and it is surmised that the Mississippi Valley Archeological
Region cultural manifestations in eastern and northeastern Arkansas represent a peripheral
hinterland of Poverty Point culture during the Late Archaic (Smith and McNutt 1988).
With the discovery of archeological sites with dense midden deposits, as well as others with only
sparse lithic scatters, it would appear that seasonal villages along the rivers and steams were most
common during the early and middle portions of the Late Archaic. However, as the Hypsithermal
presented an onset of cooler temperatures and increased moisture, it is postulated that the
populace migrated from the Lower Valley Region to the uplands in Arkansas west of the
Mississippi, where smaller groups then exploited the subsistence resources seasonally available
in the early Spring to late Fall. Then during the Summer months, they once again gathered in large
groups to survive the leaner Summer months (Morse and Morse 1983; 2009).
Early Woodland Period
Problematic to the temporal boundaries of this period is the paucity of attributed radiocarbon
dates. Nevertheless, this period is viewed as the era when pottery, burial mounds, and intensive
horticulture became synonymous with human occupation in the Central Mississippi Valley Region
(Griffin 1967). It appears to Morse and Morse (1983) that sand-tempered pottery was
manufactured at sites along older abraided streams, while a clay and grog-tempered pottery
technique was practiced on the later stream mender belts.
An Early Woodland McCarty phase was defined at the McCarty Site on the Tyronza River in
northeast Arkansas, featuring eight burials, large storage pits, Weems projectile points, and
10

Withers Fabric Impressed, Tchefuncte Stamped, and Tammany Punctuated-like pottery (Morse
and Morse 1983; 2009). At least our sites in Mississippi County are known to contain Early
Woodland components (Lafferty 1994).
Middle Woodland
Both Hopewell and Marksville cultural indicators are present during the Middle Woodland, with
the Helena phase reflecting Hopewell-like characteristics (Phillips 1970). However, some
researchers (e.g., Anderson et al. 1989) aren’t convinced that Hopewellian influences were
grounded in the Central Mississippi Valley region, but are moreso the result of interloping hunting
parties and/or inter-regional trade. The most convincing argument for Hopewellian/Marksville
entrenchment in northeastern Arkansas has been documented at the Helena Crossing Site, along
the southeastern edge of Crowley’s Ridge, and near the confluence of the St. Francis and
Mississippi rivers. Characteristic burials in log tombs, along with copper pan pipe tubes, blades,
cut mica, Busycon shell cups and beads, and copper ear spools were among the interments. A
ceramic type found on the site was Marksville Plain and Stamped. All of this
Hopewellian/Marksville-like cultural material was found, with minimal typically Middle Woodland
material.
During the latter part of the Middle Woodland, the Dunklin phase is represented by the
manufacturing of Barnes (or Kennett) and Cord Marked pottery, while the Baytown and Hoecake
phases exhibit clay and grog-tempered pottery such as Baytown Plain and Mulberry Creek Cord
Marked (Morse and McMillian 1980; Williams 1954).
Late Woodland
Perhaps the most definitive characteristics of a Late Woodland culture was documented during
the Cache River Archaeological Project in Northeastern Arkansas. There, the Late Baytown
Culture was manifested in two contemporaneous locally labeled phases: Barnes Pottery people
and Baytown Pottery People. Barnes pottery is sand-tempered, while Baytown pottery is grogtempered. Barnes pottery is confined to the north side of Crowley’s Ridge, while Bayton pottery
is found on the south side. Morse (cited in Schiffer and House 1975) surmises that possibly one
group moved into the north side of the ridge, and a second group moved into the south side.
Deeply buried Dunklin phase artifacts and dense midden deposits suggesting intense
occupation(s) have been excavated at Big Lake, near Blytheville, Arkansas (Lafferty and
Sierzchula 1987; Spears et al. 1988). In the Western Lowlands of southeast Missouri and
Northeast Arkansas, Price and Price (1980) defined the Buckskill phase which included ceramics
tempered with shell, sand, and limestone, while Scatters phase ceramics similar to Woodland were
tempered with shell. It was from this same area that some researchers believe was the origin of
Mississippian culture (Anderson et al. 1989).
Early Mississippian
An apparent natural evolution in shell-tempered ceramics, along with agricultural intensification
provided a general transition to what is known as the Mississippian Period. The Big Lake phase
is the best documented Early Mississippian phase, primarily from data obtained by extensive
11

excavations at the Zebree Site in Mississippi County, Arkansas (Morse and Morse 1980). Based
upon Kersey Site excavations in Pemiscot County, Missouri, another recognized phase in
southeast Missouri and northeast Arkansas is the Hayti phase (Marshall 1965). A third phase, the
Naylor phase, was defined based upon radiocarbon and thermoluminescenient dates of shelltempered ceramics (Lynott et al. 1986). Although farming maize may have been practiced in
selected areas during the Late Woodland and Early Mississippian, it was perhaps not until the
Middle Mississippian that the raising of maize for subsistence intensified.
Middle Mississippian
An increase in population in the Central Mississippi Valley Region during this period is manifested
by extensive agricultural practices, while hunting and foraging played a lesser role. Hierarchal
societies developed during this timeframe, emphasizing social rankings, civic ceremonial centers,
and elite to common burial practices. It was during this period that the bow and arrow was
introduced and new techniques were developed in the manufacture of pottery. Small farmsteads
focused on growing maize, and hamlets grew around ceremonial centers (Morse and Morse 1983;
2009). Middle Mississippian sites are common in both southeast Missouri and northeast Arkansas.
Important and typically Middle Mississippian large fortified village Lawhorn Phase sites along the
St. Francis River in northeast Arkansas include Shugtown, Lawhorn, and Hazel. A second phase
in the generally same area, but west of Crowley’s Ridge, has been labeled Cherry Valley, with
isolated hamlets, small villages, ceremonial centers, and charnel vaults where human skeletons
were found (Perino 1967).
Late Mississippian
There is archeological evidence that with the advent of the Late Mississippian, about A.D. 1400,
“Settlement systems shifted from hamlets, villages, and civic/ceremonial centers to highly
nucleated and fortified villages or towns”, most probably due to increased population and the
limited availability of lands for hunting and agriculture (Morse and Morse 1983:283). Distinct
phases within the Central Mississippi Valley, Late Mississippian Period along the St. Francis and
Mississippi rivers are labeled Nodena, Parkin, Walls, and Kent, while there is a Greebriar Phase
along the White River.
Historic Period
It is likely that Europeans first contacted Arkansas Native American tribes in 1541 when
Hernando de Soto entered the area. De Soto was probably near the Ouachita and Little Missouri
rivers when they first met the Tula, Amaye, Quapaw, Osage, and other Caddoan tribes (e.g.,
Swanton 1952). At that time the Quapaw were tethered to villages near the confluence of the
Arkansas and Mississippi rivers, and utilized the area between the Arkansas and Red rivers as
their hunting lands (Chapman 1959, 1975). Before around 1802, the Osage were likely hunting
in northern Arkansas, but then moved south and settled in what is today the White County area
(Johnson 1957). During this somewhat tumultuous era, in order to survive Native Americans
hunted deer, beaver, buffalo, and turkey, fished in the rivers and streams, raised corn, squash, and
pumpkins, and gathered wild roots, plants, and seasonally available fruits and nuts.
The next documented European contact occurred in 1673 when French explorers Marquette and
12

Joliet explored down the Mississippi to its confluence with the Arkansas River in southeast
Arkansas. In 1682, France formally laid claim to the Louisiana Territory, which included modernday Arkansas. In 1686, fur trader and explorer Henri de Tonti established the Arkansas Post
south of present-day Little Rock on the lower Arkansas River. It was the first semi-permanent
French settlement in the lower Mississippi River Valley, and a demonstrative example of France’s
aims to wrestle control of the lower Mississippi River valley, despite claims by Spain and
England. The French and Spanish traded with the Quapaw for years, and the post was of strategic
value to the French, Spanish, and Americans. The establishment of the post was the first step in
a long struggle between France, Spain, and England for dominance of the Mississippi River
Valley. It was designated as the first capital of the Arkansas Territory in 1819, but lost that status
to Little Rock in 1821.(Arkansas Post 2014; NPS 2014).
Shortly after the Spanish acquired the territory from the French in 1763, they established a land
grant system to parcel out land ownership to newly arriving Europeans. Within a few short years,
temporary white settlements along the St. Francis River were established in order to load exports
such as bear oil, salted meats, and buffalo tongues from the interior of Arkansas (Bannow 1974).
By 1798, there were 368 white settlers in Arkansas (Hempstead 1911).
Dekin et al. (1978) opine that Cherokee Native Americans migrated from the Appalachian
mountainous region and settled along the St. Francis River in northeast Arkansas in the late
1700s. Meanwhile, turmoil among Native American groups being forced into and out of the
region intensified. In 1808, the Osage ceded their claims to hunting grounds and settlements in
northern Arkansas under a treaty (Dekin et al. 1978). In 1803, the vast entire region was
purchased from France by the United States, and the Arkansas Territory was created in 1819.
Although transportation through the territory would continue to somewhat impede settlement,
the Old Military Road from St. Louis passed through in 1817, and settlers began penetrating the
Ozark and Oauchita mountains (Shinn 1967). The rivers proved to be main lines of travel in the
1800s, until railroads were constructed through the territory after the Civil War. Steamboats plied
both the Arkansas and Ouachita rivers in the 1820s and ‘30s, and stagecoach routes were
operational between Little Rock, Hot Springs, and Arkansas Post (Johnson 1957). Early settlers
grazed livestock in valley pastures until the grass was depleted, and then they moved on, resulting
in a series of seasonal and semi-permanent cabins along the major streams (Owsley 1945). Later,
settlers migrating in from Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina began clearing the forests
and established permanent farmsteads. Many were enticed by the passage of the Land Act of 1820
which made large tracts of land more affordable.
When the railroads were constructed in the Arkansas Territory, local farmers were provided
access to imported goods, as well as a means of shipping livestock and diversified farm products.
As a result, railroad towns, lumber industries in particular, and mining venturers after bauxite,
kaolin, slate, quartz, novaculite, coal, and dolomite prospered (Sabo et al. 1988). With such a
bustling economy, rich resources, and increasing population, it was inevitable that Arkansas
would be admitted to the Union as the 25th state on June 15, 1836. Lumber and minerals
continued to be exploited, and from roughly 1880 through 1920, the logging industry in Arkansas
boomed. The need for forest management was realized in the 1930s, and the logging industry in
13

modern-day Arkansas is still very much an important resource.

Archeological and Historic Site Files Research
A review of archeological site files at the Arkansas Archeological Survey Office in Fayetteville
on July 17, 2014 revealed that no formal archeological surveys had been conducted within two
kilometers of the proposed Joiner Cellular Tower site. However, eight archeological sites had
been recorded within two kilometers. One of those (3MS294) consists of 1840s Anglo-American
historic structures, but they were not extant by the 1970s. A review of the Historic Structures
files at the Arkansas State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) in Little Rock revealed that three
historic sites had been recorded within two kilometers. Only one of these three historic sites is
within the ¾-mile visual APE of the proposed Joiner Tower site. It is MS100 (described below),
was not a standing structure by the 1960s, and it is not listed nor eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP 2014).
Previously Recorded Archeological Sites Within Two Kilometers
3MS14 – Also known as the Nettle Ridge and Bell Place site, it is a 19th century Mississippian
Period site with Baytown and Nodena phase affinities, with a mound, a midden, clay-tempered
pottery, animal and human effigies, and human burials. It is situated on a natural levee southwest
of a relict stream channel. When recorded in 1972, it was described as a large village site.
3MS57 – Also known as the Lon Bowden Place, 3MS57 was reportedly a Woodland Period
mound 30 feet in diameter and six feet high, but was gradually plowed down over a 30-year
period from 1940-1970. It was located in a field adjacent to a natural stream levee.
3MS89 – This appears to have been a Mississippian Period house site located nearby the Nettle
Ridge Site (3MS14 (see description above). Cultural material included a frog effigy, along with
Bell Plain, Mississippi Plain, and Baytown Plain pottery sherds, and lithic debitage.
3MS90 – Mississipian Baytown Plain pottery sherds and chipped stone flakes were found on this
site when examined in 1971. Observers at the time surmised that it was a possible Baytown phase
house site, but it was situated in a plowed agricultural field and was very heavily disturbed.
3MS294 – The location of this historic site was documented in 1977. However, its location was
based upon an 1839-1840 General Land Office (GLO) survey map. The actual structures were
not extant in 1977. The GLO map indicates that there was a large house, with four Negro houses
in an adjacent field.
3MS870 – This site is also known as the Bowden Barn Hamlet site. It was first documented in
1970, and is described as a Woodland/Early Mississipian Period site situated on a small rise
overlooking Frenchmans Bayou. Cultural material observed at the time included Baytown Plain
and Mississippian Plain pottery sherds, and a stemmed dart point. In addition, when a barn was
14

constructed on the site in the 1930s, a human burial was found.
3MS871 – 3MS871 is located in an upper plowed field that overlooks Frenchmans Bayou. In
1971, it was described as a prehistoric site, probably Woodland in age, with lithic debitage and
clay-tempered pottery sherds. In addition, stoneware and whiteware sherds were observed on the
surface, apparently from a nearby historic tenant house.
3MS872 – This is another Woodland/Mississippian Period site located in an agricultural field
adjacent to Frenchmans Bayou. In 1972, it reportedly consisted of a surface lithic scatter with
fire-cracked rocks, and clay and shell-tempered ceramics.
Previously Recorded Historic Structures Within Two Kilometers
MS98 – When this structure was documented in 1971, this was the Louise Chapel, the oldest
church in Mississippi County still in use.
MS100 – This is the only documented site within the visual APE of the Joiner Cell Tower
location. It is reportedly the site of the J. F. Walker Homestead, and was the birthplace of J. F.
Ruddell, a Confederate officer and prominent citizen of Mississippi County. However, when the
approximated site location was recorded by Arkansas Historic Preservation Survey personnel in
1971, they noted that the house had been torn down several years before.
MS101 – Robert E. Lee Wilson was born in a cabin at this locale. It was reportedly a 1½ story
dogtrot cabin at the time. Mr. Wilson owned roughly 40,000 acres of farmland in Arkansas. By
1971, the cabin had been moved to its current location, and by 1991, the cabin although modified,
was still standing.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archeological and historical issues that could be addressed by the
types of data obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed
were site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.
Methods
In Accordance with Arkansas State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) Survey Standards, a
systematic and thorough pedestrian survey of the delineated 6,400-square foot tract was
15

conducted. Soils matrices from the six shovel tests were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh.
In accordance with a designed research plan, all redundant artifacts recovered from shovel tests
were not to be collected, but were to be placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test.
Excavation of the shovel tests were terminated either at 60 centimeters below the surface (cmbs),
or in Pleistocene soils if shallower than 60 cm.

Six shovel tests were placed within the tower’s footprint around the existing wood frame and
sheet metal building (Figure 7). The results of shovel testing were recorded on standard shovel
test forms, are on file at Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations, and are available upon
request. Table 2 presents the results of shovel testing (ST) in centimeters below the surface
(cmbs), with dry soil colors based upon a Munsell color chart. Soils were evaluated based upon
standard Soil Conservation Service guidelines (see Appendix A). No cultural material was
observed either on the surface or in any of the six shovel tests.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface that offered limited visibility within the Project Area
was conducted, and six shovel tests were excavated, but no evidence of neither prehistoric nor
historic occupation was found. Although one historic house site MS100) has been documented
within the visual APE of the proposed tower site, it has been determined as ineligible for the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Therefore, we recommend that the project should
proceed as currently designed by the project sponsor. The project should be considered as having
“no effect” on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of
Historic Places or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project
should proceed without further archeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the
vicinity until such finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified
archeological consultant, and by the Arkansas State Historic Preservation Office.
