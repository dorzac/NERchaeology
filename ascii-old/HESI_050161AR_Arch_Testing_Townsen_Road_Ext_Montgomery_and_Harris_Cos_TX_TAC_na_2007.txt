MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Townsen Road Association, Inc. (TRA) is proposing to construct a 7.2-kilometer- (km)
(4.5-mile- [mi]) long roadway (Townsen Road) located approximately 3.2 km (2.0 mi) west of
where Spring Creek joins the San Jacinto River in Montgomery and Harris counties, Texas.
The proposed Townsen Road right-of-way (ROW) will measure 61 meters (m) (200 feet [ft])
wide and will roughly follow a north-south trajectory that meanders through a matrix of uplands
and wetlands. Although the proposed road ROW is located on private property and is privately
funded, the crossing of areas under the jurisdiction of the US Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) will require a Section 404 permit issued by the USACE. As such, the areas within the
purview of the USACE along the proposed ROW fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
TRA contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct an
intensive cultural resources survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas in compliance with the
regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
cultural resources were located within the USACE jurisdictional areas, and, if so, to determine
their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Horizon archeologists conducted the intensive survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas
on 1 to 3 August 2006 in an effort to locate any cultural resource properties that potentially
would be impacted by the proposed construction project. The intensive survey resulted in the
documentation of only 1 site, 41MQ208. Site 41MQ208 is an aboriginal open camp located on
an upland terrace situated on the northern banks of Spring Creek just west of the Chevron
Cross Creek Pipeline corridor. Based on the survey level data, site 41MQ208 was considered
to have an undetermined NRHP eligibility status. As such, Horizon recommended that
mechanical trenching be conducted within the boundaries of site 41MQ208 to determine if
additional cultural materials or intact features were present at greater depths.
Survey-level investigations conducted within the remaining USACE jurisdictional areas
produced negative findings. Cultural resources clearance is recommended for these USACE
jurisdictional areas away from Spring Creek.
Upon consultation with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), additional trenching
efforts were requested (by the THC) on the previously recorded multi-component site 41HR411
as well as 41MQ208. Previous investigations at site 41HR411 were restricted to the then-

proposed Chevron Cross Creek Pipeline corridor. As such, the character and eligibility status of
site 41HR411 had not been adequately assessed. The THC recommended that backhoe
trenching efforts be initiated on site 41HR411 in order to determine if the site boundaries
overlap with the previously defined USACE jurisdictional area within the proposed ROW. In that
case, the USACE would afford protection to all portions of the site, even if it was only partially
within its jurisdiction.
To determine the NRHP eligibility of sites 41MQ208 and 41HR411 and test the deep
alluvial sands associated with Spring Creek, Horizon conducted backhoe trenching efforts on 1
and 2 March 2007. The backhoe trenches excavated on either bank of Spring Creek and within
the boundaries of previously recorded site 41HR411 produced negative findings. In fact, site
41HR411 appears to have been so severely impacted by construction activities associated with
several nearby pipelines that Horizon archeologists failed to find any cultural materials in the
vicinity either in surface or subsurface contexts. It appears as if site 41HR411 has deteriorated
considerably over time, and presently absolutely no evidence of prehistoric or historic artifacts
were identified during the field efforts. As such, it is Horizonâs opinion that site 41HR411
remains ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further work is recommended.
Testing investigations conducted within the boundaries of site 41MQ208 failed to
document any deeply buried cultural deposits. In general, the site consists of sparse prehistoric
deposits in fine sandy loam that lack cultural features or preserved organic materials.
Additionally, the site is situated directly adjacent to a wide pipeline ROW, which likely disturbed
at least a portion of the site in the past, resulting in a fragmented archeological record.
Furthermore, the sparse deposits of site 41MQ208 are similar to those on other sites in the area
that have been tested by Horizon in the past with comparable results (Brownlow 2003 and
2005). With this in mind, it is Horizonâs opinion that site 41MQ208 is not eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP. Horizon recommends no further work on this site.
Based on the results of this investigation, it is Horizonâs opinion that the construction of
the proposed Townsen Road ROW will have no effect on any significant cultural resources
within the USACE jurisdictional areas. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance
be granted for the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed ROW. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
facility, even in previously surveyed area, all work should cease immediately and the THC
should be notified of the discovery.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas within the Proposed 4.5-Mile
Townsen Road Right-of-Way, Montgomery and Harris Counties, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Townsen Road Association, Inc. (TRA) is proposing to construct a 7.2-kilometer- (km)
(4.5-mile- [mi]) long roadway (Townsen Road) located approximately 3.2 km (2.0 mi) west of
where Spring Creek joins the San Jacinto River in Montgomery and Harris counties, Texas
(Figures 1 and 2). The proposed Townsen Road right-of-way (ROW) will measure 61 meters
(m) (200 feet [ft]) wide and will roughly follow a north-south trajectory that meanders through a
matrix of uplands and wetlands. Although the proposed road ROW is located on private
property and is privately funded, the crossing of areas under the jurisdiction of the US Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) will require a Section 404 permit issued by the USACE. As such,
the areas within the purview of the USACE along the proposed ROW fall under the regulations
of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
TRA contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct an
intensive cultural resources survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas in compliance with the
regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
cultural resources were located within the USACE jurisdictional areas, and, if so, to determine
their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). In all, a total of 6
USACE jurisdictional areas were investigated. For clarification purposes, the investigated
USACE jurisdictional areas consist of the portions of the ROW located within 30 to 60 m (100 to
200 ft) of each of the 6 USACE jurisdictional crossings present along the proposed ROW.
Utilizing this methodology, the investigated jurisdictional areas total approximately 6.4 acres (ac)
(3.0 hectares [ha]). Again, only the USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROW were
investigated since these are the only locations requiring a federal permitting action and, as
such, are regulated by Section 106 of the NHPA.
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the project area, NRHP eligibility testing of sites 41MQ208 and 41HR411,
and the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer
(SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THC) Rules of Practice and
Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines
for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Abigail Peyton (Horizon staff archeologist)
served as Principal Investigator for the project. She, Reign Clark, Jared Wiersema, and Michael
Mudd (Horizon field technicians) conducted the field investigation on 1 to 3 August 2006 and
again on 1 and 2 March 2007.

Chapter 1: Introduction

The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 3 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 0 to 2 acres in size. Rather
than lumping the total acreage of all the USACE jurisdictional areas together for this specific
survey, the Horizon field crew assessed each USACE jurisdictional area as if it encompassed 1
total acre, although in reality each jurisdictional area measured considerably less than 1 acre.
Because an area measuring 30 m by 60 m (100 ft long by 200 ft) wide on each side of each
waterway was considered to be a USACE jurisdictional area, the actual acreage at each
location equated more to around 0.4 ac (0.16 ha). This rule, of course, was altered in the case
of Spring Creek (USACE crossing #1), and a larger jurisdictional area (60 m by 60 m [200 ft by
200 ft]) was adopted in order to include the sandy upland terraces located on either bank.
Regardless, the Horizon field crew set out to excavate a minimum of 4 shovel tests at each
USACE jurisdictional area, preferably 4 on each bank. When assessed in regard to overall
acreage, a total of 13 shovel tests would have been required for the 6.4 ac (3.0 ha) comprising
the USACE jurisdictional areas. Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards by
excavating a total of 72 shovel tests.
The intensive survey resulted in the documentation of only 1 site, 41MQ208. Site
41MQ208 is an aboriginal open camp located on an upland terrace situated on the northern
banks of Spring Creek just west of the Chevron Cross Creek Pipeline corridor. Plainware
ceramic body sherds and lithic debitage were recovered from 3 tightly grouped shovel tests at
depths ranging from 20 to 120 centimeters below the surface (cmbs) (8 to 47 inches below the
surface [inbs]). The lithic specimens recovered from the site are clearly of aboriginal
manufacture, although none are temporally diagnostic. The presence of ceramics suggests that
aboriginal inhabitants of the area began occupying site 41MQ208 sometime after A.D. 100, the
initiation of the Early Ceramic Period (Aten 1983). The recovered ceramic body sherds exhibit a
sandy paste, which is a characteristic commonly attributed to the Goose Creek Plain ceramic
style typically found in Montgomery County. Goose Creek sandy paste pottery was used
throughout Southeast Texas in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and early part of the Historic
period (Aten 1984; Patterson 1995; Pertulla et al. 1995). Given the small sample size and the
lack of explicit technological or stylistic traits, it is difficult to provide a more specific occupation
date based on the ceramic assemblage alone.
The artifacts on site 41MQ208 were recovered from a homogenous tan sandy matrix.
Clayey sediments generally associated with Pre-Holocene deposits were not encountered on
any portion of the site. At present, the distribution of positive and negative shovel tests
demarcates a very small site boundary that measures approximately 12 m E/W by 6 m N/S (39
ft E/W by 20 ft N/S). No cultural features were observed during the recording of this site.
Due to the depth of the alluvial deposits on the site with the potential to contain deeply
buried, stratified cultural deposits, the NRHP eligibility status of site 41MQ208 was not formally
determined. Rather, site 41MQ208âs NRHP eligibility status was declared undetermined. As
such, Horizon recommended that mechanical trenching be conducted within the boundaries of
site 41MQ208 to determine if additional cultural materials or features are present at greater
depths. Additionally, the TSMASS require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other
areas with the potential to contain buried cultural materials at depths below those that shovel

tests are capable of reaching (approximately 1.0 m [3 ft] below surface). The portions of the
Townsen Road ROW that traverse Spring Creek and its adjacent terraces were found to contain
deep alluvial deposits. Shovel tests in these areas were excavated to a maximum feasible
depth of 1 m (3 ft); however, the bottom of the sandy matrix was not reached in many areas.
Given the presence of deeply buried, intact sandy deposits near Spring Creek within the
USACE jurisdictional boundary, it was Horizonâs opinion that mechanical trenching should also
be conducted within the alluvial terraces of Spring Creek to determine if additional cultural
resources are present at greater depths.
Upon consultation with the THC, additional trenching efforts were requested (by the
THC) on the previously recorded multi-component site 41HR411 as well as site 41MQ208. Site
41HR411 is located on the upland slopes approximately 960 ft (293 m) southeast of Spring
Creek and 790 ft (240 m) southeast of USACE jurisdictional crossing #6 (see Figure 1).
Previous investigations at site 41HR411 were primarily restricted to the then-proposed Chevron
Cross Creek Pipeline corridor. As such, the character and NRHP eligibility status of site
41HR411 had not been adequately assessed. The THC recommended that backhoe trenching
efforts be initiated on site 41HR411 in order to determine if the site boundaries overlap with the
previously defined USACE jurisdictional crossing #6. In that case, the USACE would afford
protection to all portions of the site, even if it was only partially within its jurisdiction.
Investigations conducted within the remaining USACE jurisdictional areas produced
negative findings. Aside from Spring Creek, the USACE jurisdictional stream crossings
traversed by the proposed Townsen Road ROW were found to be primarily ephemeral in nature
and were generally accompanied by marshy wetlands. Additionally, clayey sediments were
frequently encountered along the banks of these small streams. No additional investigations
were recommended for these areas. Cultural resources clearance was recommended for these
USACE jurisdictional areas, and the THC concurred with these findings, stating that work should
be allowed to proceed in those areas away from Spring Creek in a letter dated 4 January 2007.
To determine the NRHP eligibility of sites 41MQ208 and 41HR411 and test the deep
alluvial sands associated with Spring Creek, Horizon conducted backhoe trenching efforts on 1
and 2 March 2007. These investigations consisted of the excavation of a total of 4 trenches: 1
on the upland terrace within the previously recorded site 41HR411, 1 on the southern banks of
Spring Creek, 1 in the deep alluvial deposits directly adjacent to the northern banks of Spring
Creek, and 1 within the previously determined boundary of site 41MQ208. The backhoe
trenches excavated on either bank of Spring Creek and within previously recorded site
41HR411 produced negative findings. In fact, site 41HR411 appears to have been so severely
impacted by construction activities associated with several nearby pipelines that Horizon
archeologists failed to find any cultural materials in the vicinity either in surface or subsurface
contexts. Additionally, dense clayey sediments were observed at relatively shallow depths
ranging from 20-45 cmbs (8 to 18 inbs) on the upland formation where site 41HR411 is located.
Given the near-surface nature of the clayey deposits on site 41HR411, it is highly unlikely that
any previously buried culturally significant features have remained intact after years of invasive
modern disturbances and subsequent erosion.

Chapter 1: Introduction

Trenching investigations conducted within the boundaries of site 41MQ208 resulted in
the recovery of 3 small non-diagnostic chert flakes. The lithic artifacts were found in a
homogenous tan sandy matrix at depths ranging from 30 to 110 cmbs (12 to 43 inbs).
Trenching was originally recommended on site 41MQ208 due to the potential for significant
cultural materials at depths beyond shovel testing capabilities. However, the subsequent
recovery of artifacts only from the upper 110 cm (43 in) of sediment indicates that deeper
cultural materials and/or features are likely not present. As such, the trenching efforts on site
41MQ208 succeeded in delineating the vertical extent of the site and in doing so reinforced the
adequateness of the original survey efforts. In other words, due to the lack of cultural materials
or features at greater depths (below 120 cm) in the backhoe trench, it can be stated that the
vertical and horizontal boundaries of site 41MQ208 have been confidently defined. In general,
the testing investigations on site 41MQ208 revealed sparse prehistoric deposits with no artifacts
observed below the cultural zone (i.e., 20 to 120 cmbs [8 to 47 in]) previously identified during
the original survey efforts. Additionally, the site is situated directly adjacent to a wide pipeline
ROW, which likely disturbed at least a portion of the site in the past, resulting in a fragmented
archeological record.
Site 41MQ208 is similar to a number of other sites in the area investigated by Horizon in
the past few years (Brownlow 2003 and 2005). Testing investigations on relatively nearby sites
that possessed similar sparse assemblages failed to produce any evidence of subsurface
features or stratified deposits. Based on this previous experience, it is believed that any
additional investigations on the site would produce similar results, and, as such, are
unwarranted. With this in mind, it is Horizonâs opinion that site 41MQ208 is not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon recommends no further work on this site.
Based on the results of this investigation, it is Horizonâs opinion that the construction of
the proposed Townsen Road ROW will have no effect on any significant cultural resources
within the USACE jurisdictional areas. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance
be granted for the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed ROW. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
facility, even in previously surveyed area, all work should cease immediately and the THC
should be notified of the discovery.

Townsen Road Right-of-Way, Montgomery and Harris Counties, Texas

2.0 PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The project area consists of the USACE jurisdictional areas that are traversed by the
proposed Townsen Road ROW. The project area is located north of Humble, Texas,
approximately 3.2 km (2.0 mi) west of where Spring Creek flows into the West Fork of the San
Jacinto River. The majority of the project area is located in Montgomery County; however,
approximately 0.5 mi of the Townsen Road will reside in Harris County. The project area can be
found on US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5â Maedan, Texas, topographic quadrangle (see
Figure 1). The proposed Townsen Road will measure approximately 7.2 km (4.5 mi) long with a
61 m (200 ft) wide ROW and will roughly follow a north-south trajectory that meanders through a
matrix of uplands and wetlands. Overall, the proposed ROW is dominated by extremely thick
vegetation consisting of stands of pine, oak, magnolia, and cypress trees. As such, surface
visibility was poor across most of the project area with the exception of those areas where
logging roads, pipelines, or trails offered an open corridor.
The only federal permit that the construction of the proposed ROW will require consists
of a Section 404 permit issued by the USACE for impacts to âwaters of the US.â As such, only
the USACE jurisdictional areas along the proposed ROW fall under the jurisdiction of Section
106 of the NHPA. For this reason, the USACE jurisdictional areas consist of the portions of the
ROW located within 30 to 60 m (100 to 200 ft) of each of the 6 USACE jurisdictional crossings
present along the proposed ROW. In all, the USACE jurisdictional areas total 6.4 ac (3 ha).
Photographs of each of the 6 USACE jurisdictional crossings are presented in Figures 3 through
8.

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located in south-central Montgomery County and north-central Harris
County, Texas, north of the Houston city limits. Montgomery County is situated on the Gulf
Coastal Plain in southeastern Texas inland from the Gulf of Mexico shore. The Gulf of Mexico
represents a structural basin formed by lithosphere deformation. The Texas Coastal Plain,
which extends as far north as the Ouachita uplift in southern Oklahoma and westward to the
Balcones Escarpment, consists of seaward-dipping bodies of sedimentary rock, most of which
are of terrigenous clastic origin, that reflect the gradual infilling of the basin from its margins

(Abbott 2001). The Houston area is underlain by rocks and unconsolidated sediments that are
quite young in a geological sense, ranging from modern to Miocene in age. These consist
predominantly of a series of fluviodeltaic bodies arranged in an offlapped sequence, with
interdigitated and capping eolian, littoral, and estuarine facies making up a relatively minor
component of the lithology. Major bounding disconformities between these formations are
usually interpreted to represent depositional hiatuses that occurred during periods of sea level
low stand. The oldest rocks in this fill are of Late Cretaceous age. As a result of the geometry
of basin filling, successively younger rock units crop out in subparallel bands from the basin
margin toward the modern coastline.
The project area traverses stream terraces, upland settings, and marshy wetlands
located in the broad undulating region located at the crux of the West Fork of the San Jacinto
River and Spring Creek. The San Jacinto River, in turn, flows southeastward and discharges
into the Gulf of Mexico.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The project area is underlain by the Deweyville Formation and Beaumont Formation
(Shelby et al. 1968). The Deweyville Formation consists of sand, silt, and clay, with some
gravel. The Beaumont Formation consists of mostly clay, silt, and sand. The project area is
situated on sandy soils of the Albany-Tuckerman association (McClintock et al. 1971). This
association consists of deep, level to gently sloping, somewhat poorly drained and poorly
drained, sandy and loamy soils on low stream terraces. Specifically, the project area is
underlain by Albany fine sand (Ab), Bruno loamy fine sand (Br), Chipley fine sand (Ch), Hatliff
loam (Hf), and Tuckerman loam, heavy substratum (Tk).

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
While the paleoclimatic history of the coastal region remains unclear, Bryant and Holloway
(1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas that includes
3 separate climatic periodsâthe Wisconsin Full Glacial Period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.), the Late
Glacial Period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), and the Post-Glacial Period (10,000 B.P. to present).
Evidence from the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas
was considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region
was more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and
Holloway 1985). The Late Glacial Period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a
slow warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous
woodlands were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway
1985). During the Post-Glacial Period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have
been more stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post
oak savannas. The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial Period continued
into the mid-Holocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more
mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and

Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were
probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.
The modern climate of the upper Texas coast, including the region surrounding Houston,
is classified as subtropical humid (Abbott 2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983), forming a transitional
zone between the humid southeastern US and the semiarid to arid west. The climate reflects
the influences of latitude, low elevation, and proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, which combine with
the urban heat island formed by the tremendous concentration of asphalt and concrete to give
the Houston area a notorious modern climate that is oppressively warm and moist throughout
much of the year. As a result of proximity to the Gulf and the abundance of surface water,
humidity in the early morning can approach 100% even on cloudless summer days, and it often
exceeds 50% even on the warmest afternoons. Largely as a consequence of the relatively high
humidity characteristic of the region, temperature patterns exhibit a moderate annual range and
a modest diurnal range that increases slightly with distance from the coast. Average monthly
high temperature ranges from a low of 17 to 19Â°Celcius (Â°C) (59 to 63Â°Fahrenheit [Â°F]) in
January to a high of 38 to 40Â°C (89 to 96Â°F) in August. Average monthly lows range from 4 to
9Â°C (38 to 47Â°F) in January to 25 to 29Â°C (72 to 79Â°F) in July and August. Annually, average
low temperatures range from 15 to 21Â°C (56 to 65Â°F), and average high temperatures range
from 27 to 29Â°C (75 to 79Â°F) (Abbott 2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983).
The Houston region experiences 2 precipitation peaks throughout the year (Abbott 2001;
McClintock et al. 1971). The first occurs in the late spring (i.e., May to June) due to the passage
of infrequent cold fronts that spawn chains of powerful frontal thunderstorms. The second
occurs in the late summer to early autumn (i.e., August to September) due to the incidence of
tropical storms and hurricanes from the Atlantic and, occasionally, Pacific oceans. In contrast,
winter and early spring are relatively dry, and high summer rainfall is dominated by convectional
thunderstorms that are relatively brief and localized, albeit frequently intense. Average annual
precipitation varies from a low of approximately 100 cm (40 in) to a high of more than 132 cm
(52 in). Average monthly precipitation varies from less than 5 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in) in March to
more than 19 cm (7.5 in) occurring locally on the coast during September. Almost all of the
measurable precipitation falls as rainâsnowfall is extremely rare, occurring in measurable
amounts in only 1 in 10 years.

FLORA AND FAUNA

Montgomery and Harris Counties are situated near the southeastern edge of the Texas
biotic province (Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and
Carolinian provinces and the grasslands of the Kansas, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces.
Some species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texas province. McMahan et
al. (1984) further define 4 broad communities that characterize that portion of the Texas biotic
province that lies on the Gulf Coastal Plain: (1) coastal marsh/barrier island, (2) coastal prairie,
(3) coastal gallery forest, and (4) pine-hardwood forest (cf. Abbott 2001:24-26).
The coastal marsh/barrier island category includes well-drained, sandy, coastal
environments and saline and freshwater wetlands in the coastal zone (Abbott 2001:24). Marsh
vegetation is typical of areas that are seasonally wet and have substrates composed primarily of
12

sands and silts, clays, or organic decomposition products. Vegetation assemblages are
strongly controlled by texture, salinity, frequency and duration of inundation, and depth of the
seasonal water table. Sandy, relatively well-drained, freshwater environments are typically
dominated by little bluestem, switchgrass, Florida paspalum, and brownseed paspalum. Wetter
environments are often dominated by marshhay cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, saggitaria,
bulrushes, smooth cordgrass, seashore paspalum, seashore dropseed, olney bulrush,
saltmarsh bulrush, saltmarsh aster, longtom, sprangletop, burhead, arrowhead, coastal
waterhyssop, needlegrass rush, and other sedges and rushes. Slightly higher, better-drained
environments are characterized by such taxa as seashore saltgrass, seashore paspalum,
gulfdune paspalum, shoregrass, gulf cordgrass, red lovegrass, bushy sea-oxey, and glasswort.
A variety of fauna are characteristic of the shore zone. Important larger taxa include raccoon,
nutria, alligators, turtles, swamp rabbit, and many birds, including ducks, geese, herons, and
many smaller species. Aquatic taxa, including a wealth of fish and shellfish adapted to brackish
to hypersaline conditions, are also important in the coastal zone.
The coastal prairie category consists primarily of grasses with minor amounts of forbs
and woody plants in areas that are not saturated on a seasonal basis (Abbott 2001:24-26). This
community is characteristic of upland areas and grades into the pine-hardwood forest to the
north and east and into the coastal marsh/barrier island to the south. A wide variety of grasses
are found in the prairie environments, but the principal taxa include big bluestem, little bluestem,
indiangrass, eastern grama, switchgrass, brownseed paspalum, sideoats grama, silver
bluestem, buffalograss, threeawn, and Texas wintergrass. Common forbs include Maximilian
sunflower, Engelman daisy, blacksalmon, penstemon, dotted gayfeather, bundleflower, yellow
neptunia, snoutbean, prairie clover, tickclover, wildbean, western indigo, paintbrush,
bluebonnet, ragweed, croton, milkweed, vetch, verbena, and winecup. Woody plants occurring
in the coastal prairie include mesquite, honey locust, huisache, eastern baccharis, sesbania, live
oak, elm, hackberry, bumelia, and coralberry. The frequency of trees increases dramatically as
the coastal prairie grades into the pine-hardwood forest, forming an open woodland
environment with common stands of hardwood trees and occasional pines. The coastal prairie
is home to a diverse fauna, including coyote, white-tailed deer, skunks, cottontail rabbit, many
small rodents, amphibians and reptiles, and a variety of permanent and migratory birds. Bison
and pronghorn were also present at various times in the past.
The coastal gallery forest consists of diverse, principally deciduous trees and associated
understory in floodplains and streams that traverse the outer coastal plain (Abbott 2001:26).
Important taxa include water oak, pecan, poplar, American elm, cedar elm, sugarberry, ash,
loblolly pine, post oak, cherrybark oak, mulberry, swamp chestnut oak, willow oak, sweetgum,
hawthorn, dogwood, hickory, bois dâarc, sassafras cypress, willow, cottonwood, and sumac.
Shrubs and vines such as mustang grape, greenbrier, yaupon, coralberry, possumhaw,
elderberry, honeysuckle, dewberry, and blackberry are common in the understory, as are
grasses such as little bluestem, big bluestem, and indiangrass. The fauna of the gallery forest
include white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, turkey, a variety of small mammals and
rodents, turtles, snakes, and many birds. Black bears were also present at various times in the
past, and a number of fish and a few varieties of shellfish are present in the streams.

Chapter 2.0: Project Area Description

The pine-hardwood forest is characterized by a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees,
including longleaf pine, shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, post oak, red oak, white oak, blackjack oak,
willow oak, and live oak (Abbott 2001:26). Riparian environments often support larger
deciduous trees like pecan, cottonwood, hickory, beech, and American elm. Understory
vegetation varies from relatively open to quite dense, and consists of shrubs, vines, forbs, and
young trees. Common shrubs include acacia, yaupon, mayhaw, wild persimmon, myrtle,
greenbrier, Virginia creeper, blackberry, dewberry, trumpet vine, gourd, and poison ivy. A
variety of fauna is also present, including white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, rabbit,
mink, skunk, various small rodents, turtles, reptiles, and many different birds. Black bears were
also present at times in the past, and bison and pronghorn were occasionally present in the
transition zone to the coastal prairie environment.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, a 21county area extending from the Colorado River on the west to the Sabine River on the east and
measuring about 200 km (124 miles) inland from the Texas gulf coastline. In broad terms, much
of the archeological record in Southeast Texas represents an interface between the Southern
Great Plains and the Southeastern Woodlands (Aten 1983, 1984; Patterson 1995; Story 1990).
Further distinctions are often made between the inland and coastal margin subregions of
Southeast Texas. These 2 subregions are somewhat culturally distinct, and the inland
subregion has a much longer chronological record. The coastal margin of Southeast Texas
comprises a zone about 25 km (16 miles) inland from the coast that covers the area influenced
by gulf tidal flows on the salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. Considerable ecological variability
characterizes this subregion, including woodlands, coastal prairie, lakes, wetlands, marine
coastline, and barrier islands. The inland subregion also encompasses considerable ecological
diversity, including mixed woodlands, coastal prairies, and dense piney woods.
The human inhabitants of Southeast Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting-andgathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory. While many of the same labels are used to
denote Southeast Texas cultural/chronological periods, the timeframe and cultural
characteristics of Southeast Texas cultural periods are often different than in neighboring
regions. For instance, the Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods are different in Central and
Southeast Texas, and Central Texas lacks the Early Ceramic period that has been defined for
Southeast Texas.
Mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time
in Southeast Texas. Inland sites are usually found near a water source, usually exhibit
evidence of reoccupation through time, have well-defined intrasite activity areas, tend not to be
associated with satellite activity sites or separate base camps, and exhibit a range of
subsistence-related activities. Inland sites tend to contain modest pottery assemblages, fired
clay balls (at some sites), abundant lithic material, and an absence of shell tools. Coastal sites
tend to consist of multicomponent Rangia shell middens that contain oyster shell tools, large
quantities of pottery (in later cultural components), numerous bone tools, and few lithic
materials.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (10,000 TO 5000 BC)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 BC (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (but see Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Southeast Texas is
represented by the PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 5000 BC) (Patterson 1995). This stage
coincided with ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that
witnessed the extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing
various periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often
fluted, lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end
scrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas
are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is
little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America; rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced during all prehistoric time periods.
In Southeast Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on
recognizable differences in projectile point styles (Patterson 1995). These include the Early
PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 8000 BC), which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile
points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian
period (8000 to 5000 BC), which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).
3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (5000 BC TO AD 100)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend signaled the beginning of the Archaic stage
(5000 BC to AD 100) (Patterson 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Southeast Texas.
Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and
corresponding decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a
diversified resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Southeast Texas,
however, this hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The

16

050161_arch_testing_report.docx

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas within the Proposed 4.5-Mile
Townsen Road Right-of-Way, Montgomery and Harris Counties, Texas

appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone
assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural
stage. Material culture shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in
the application of groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
In Southeast Texas, the Early Archaic period (5000 to 3000 BC) is marked by the presence of
Bell, Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed projectile points. The
Bell point is the only type in this period that is closely associated with the Southern Plains.
Many of the latter point types continue into the Middle Archaic period (3000 to 1500 BC) and
several new types appear, including Bulverde, Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and
probably the Gary-Kent series. The Late Archaic period (1500 BC to AD 100) is characterized
by Gary, Kent, Darl, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos points.
In the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late Archaic mortuary tradition
developed in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys and in the intervening area (Hall 1981;
Patterson 1995). Organized burial practices actually started during the Middle Archaic period
but reached full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods such as
boatstones and bannerstones (probably used as atlatl weights), stone gorgets, corner-tang
knives, stingray spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads and pendants. Other burial
practices included the systematic orientation of burial direction, body position, use of red ochre,
and use of locally made grave goods, such as longbone implements and bone pins. Most
burials are found in extended supine position, though some extended prone and bundle burials
are also known. Burial direction is usually consistent within single sites but varies from site to
site. Patterson et al. (1993) report that at least 11 sites are associated with this mortuary
tradition in Austin, Fort Bend, and Wharton counties.

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (AD 100 TO 600)

The use of pottery did not start uniformly throughout Southeast Texas. Pottery
manufacture appears to have diffused into this region from adjacent regions, primarily from the
east along the coastal margin. Aten (1983:297) argues that pottery was being manufactured on
the coastal margin of the Texas-Louisiana border by about 70 BC, in the Galveston Bay area by
about AD 100, in the western part of the coastal margin by about AD 300, and in the ConroeLivingston inland area by about AD 500. The practice of pottery manufacture appears to have
progressed first along the coastal margin and then moved inland (Patterson 1995).
Southeastern Texas ceramic chronologies are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where
Aten (1983) established a detailed chronological sequence.
The earliest ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay and neighboring Sabine Lake areas
appear to be approximately contemporaneous with the earliest ceramic periods of the lower
Mississippi Valley (Aten 1984). Early assemblages contain substantial quantities of Tchefuncte
ceramics. In the Sabine Lake region, grog-tempered varieties of Baytown Plain and Marksville
Stamped are common, while grog-tempered ceramics do not occur in the Galveston Bay area

HJN 050161 AR

17

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

80 miles (129 km) to the west until several hundred years later. With the principal exception of
a few Tchefuncte ceramic types, other southern Louisiana ceramics are not found on the Gulf
Coast west of the Sabine Lake area.
Goose Creek sandy-paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat
farther north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and early part of the Historic period (Aten
1984; Patterson 1995; Pertulla et al. 1995). The Goose Creek series is the primary utility ware
throughout the prehistoric sequence in Southeast Texas, though it gives way to Baytown Plain
for about 200 years during the transition between the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods
before once again becoming predominant into the Historic period (Aten 1984). A minor variety,
Goose Creek Stamped, occurs only in the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983). Three other minor
pottery typesâTchefuncte (Plain and Stamped), Mandeville, and OâNeal Plain variety Conway
(Aten 1983)âwere used only during the Early Ceramic period. The Mandeville and Tchefuncte
types are characterized by contorted paste and poor coil wedging. Mandeville has sandy paste
(like Goose Creek), while Tchefuncte paste has relatively little sand. Given their technological
similarities, Mandeville and Tchefuncte may represent different clay sources rather than distinct
pottery types (Patterson 1995). The bone-tempered pottery that characterizes ceramic
assemblages elsewhere in Texas is not common in Southeast Texas.

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (AD 600 TO 1500)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (AD 600 to 1500) (Patterson 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. Elsewhere in Texas, pottery also appears during the
latter part of the Late Prehistoric period; however, as previously discussed, ceramics appear
earlier in Southeast Texas. Along the coastal margin of Southeast Texas, use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland sub-region along with the bow and arrow through the
Late Prehistoric period (Ensor and Carlson 1991; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson 1980, 1995;
Wheat 1953). In fact, Patterson (1995:254) proposes that use of the bow and arrow started in
Southeast Texas as early as the end of the Middle Archaic period, using unifacial arrow points
that consisted of marginally retouched flakes. In contrast, Prewitt (1981) argues for a
generalized date of adoption of the bow-and-arrow hunting system at about the same time (ca.
AD 600) in Central and Southeast Texas. In Southeast Texas, unifacial arrow points appear to
be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. Bifacial arrow point types include Alba,
Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn.
Grog- (i.e., crushed-sherd-) tempered pottery was used in the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods in Southeast Texas. The grog-tempered varieties include San Jacinto
Plain and Baytown Plain variety Phoenix Lake. San Jacinto pottery contains a relatively small
proportion of small-sized temper, while Baytown Plain has larger amounts of sherd pieces that
are often visible on vessel surfaces. As previously mentioned, sandy-paste Goose Creek
pottery remained in use throughout the Late Prehistoric period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt

Coated pottery from the Central Texas Coast (Ricklis 1995) are found at a few sites in
Southeast Texas during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods.

3.5

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1500 TO 1700)

For the most part, Protohistoric and early Historic Indian sites in Southeast Texas have
not been articulated with the ethnographic record (Story 1990:258). Similarly, reconciling the
ethnographic record to prehistoric Indian groups in this region is problematic. Late Prehistoric
and Historic population movements further complicate this issue.
Aten (1983) has
reconstructed the territories of native groups present in this region in the early 18th century,
including the Akokisa, Atakapa, Bidai, Coco (possibly Karankawa), and Tonkawa. The
presence of the Tonkawa in Southeast Texas may be due to their rapid expansion from Central
Texas in the 17th and 18th centuries (Newcomb 1993:27). The Karankawa Indians are thought
to have occupied the coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and the
corresponding mainland (Aten 1983). Judging by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites east
of the San Bernard River, the ethnic association of the Karankawa Indians with the Coco tribe
may be in doubt.
Protohistoric and Historic Indian sites may not be systematically recognized as such
because few aboriginal artifact types changed from the Late Prehistoric to the Historic periods
(Patterson 1995). Only a few non-European artifact types are useful in identifying Historic
Indian sites, including Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero arrow points and possibly Fresno and
Cuney points after A.D. 1500 (Hudgins 1986). Historic period Indian sites are usually identified
by the presence of glass and metal artifacts, gunflints, and European types of pottery.

3.6

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1700 A.D. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Ãlvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Ãlvar NÃºÃ±ez
Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near
Galveston Bay; however, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until
after 1700. The first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission
system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native
culture and social systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where
the burial data suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as
increased participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the
time heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous
Indian population was greatly diminished. The Alabama/Coushatta Indians who currently reside
in Southeast Texas are migrants who were displaced from the east in the late 18th to early
19th centuries (Newcomb 1961).
The earliest European explorer of what became Montgomery County was probably the
Frenchman RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, who evidently passed through the area in

HJN 050161 AR

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

16871. When news of French incursions reached Spanish authorities, they sent several
expeditions to the region to reclaim it for Spain. During the mid-19th century the Spanish made
several attempts to establish settlements in the area and eventually set up 3 missions on the
banks of Spring Creek within the current boundaries of Montgomery County, but the missions
were abandoned in 1756 and no permanent Spanish settlements were established. The future
Montgomery County area was included in the colonization contracts issued by Spanish and later
Mexican authorities to empresario Stephen F. Austin, and, during the early 1820s, AngloAmerican settlers began moving into the region. Forty-two families of Austinâs colony obtained
land titles from the Mexican government and settled in western Montgomery County. Among
the earliest settlers was Andrew Montgomery, who established a trading post at the crossroads
of the Loma del Toro and lower Coushatta traces. He was soon joined by relatives and others,
and the settlement eventually grew into the town of Montgomery. During the early 1830s, the
population of the region increased rapidly, and, in December 1837, the Republic of Texas
Congress established Montgomery County, which was named for its largest settlement. The
new county was carved from Washington County, and its borders originally extended from the
Brazos River on the west to the Trinity on the east, and from the Old San Antonio Road on the
north to the San Jacinto River on the south, an area that included future Grimes, Walker, San
Jacinto, Madison, and Waller counties. The countyâs present boundaries were established after
the establishment of Waller County in 1870.
On the eve of the Civil War, Montgomery County was in most ways typical of the
counties of the region, decidedly Southern in character and outlook, with a rapidly developing
plantation economy. Montgomery remained the largest town, but several other trading centers
had emerged, including Danville, Bayâs Chapel, Cincinnati, and Waverly. Methodist minister
I.L.G. Strickland began preaching in Montgomery in the early 1840s, and, in the early 1850s,
Baptists had organized the first church there. Several private schools also began operating
during the 1850s, including the Montgomery Academy, which earned a reputation as one of the
preeminent schools of the region. The Civil War and its aftermath brought profound changes to
the county. Not surprisingly, given its large number of slaveholders, Montgomery Countyâs
citizens overwhelmingly supported the Southern cause, and nearly 80% (318 of 416) of those
who went to the polls cast their votes in favor of secession. The countyâs men volunteered for
the Confederate army in large numbers, a sizeable number of them serving in the Fourth Texas
Regiment of Hoodâs Texas Brigade; others joined Terryâs Texas Rangers (Eighth Texas
Cavalry). Many of the early volunteers saw considerable action during the war, and as many as
3/4 of them were killed or injured before warâs end. For those who remained at home, there
were other problems to deal with, including lack of markets for goods, shortages, and wild
fluctuations in Confederate currency. The end of the war brought wrenching changes to the
countyâs economy. For many of Montgomery Countyâs white inhabitants, the abolition of slavery
meant devastating economic loss. Prior to the Civil War, slaves had constituted nearly half of all
taxable property in the county, and their loss, coupled with a decline in property values, caused
a profound disruption for most planters. The African-American population of Montgomery

County fared even worse. Most blacks left the farms owned by their former masters to seek
better working and living conditions; however, for the vast majority, the change brought only
marginal improvement. Most ended up working as agricultural laborers or as sharecroppers,
receiving 1/3 or 1/2 of the crop for their labors.
Montgomery County escaped much of the strife that many other Texas counties
experienced during Reconstruction. No permanent federal garrison was stationed in the county,
and there was no Freedmenâs Bureau. Citizens nevertheless chafed under local Republican
rule, and there were isolated acts of violence and intimidation directed at African-American
officials. By the early 1870s, the local white elite had once more gained control of the countyâs
affairs, and, through the use of the White Primary, literacy tests, and threats, managed to
effectively disenfranchise the black population until the 1960s. Like most of the counties in the
state, Montgomery County experienced a prolonged post-war agricultural depression. During
the Civil War, prices for cotton had skyrocketed, and landowners had planted ever-increasing
amounts of land in cotton to reap the benefits. After the war, falling prices and the loss of cheap
slave labor combined to severely depress the local economy. To make ends meet, many
landowners opted to grow even more cotton, badly depleting the soil in the process. By the
1880s, the soil in many areas of the county was so poor that cotton yields were as low as 1/3 to
3/4 of a bale per acre. Some farmers turned to livestock-raising or other small grains, such as
corn and wheat, but cotton nevertheless remained the countyâs leading cash crop until the end
of the century.
The countyâs economy began to recover in the 1870s and early 1880s with the
construction of several railroads. In 1871, the International-Great Northern Railroad was built
across the county; in 1879, a narrow-gauge line known as the Houston, East, and West Texas
was constructed; and, in 1880, the Houston and Texas Central built a branch line from
Navasota to Montgomery and extended eastward to Conroe. The construction of the railroads
touched off an intense controversy concerning the location of the county seat. The first railroad
missed the town of Montgomery. Willis, a new town on the railroad, was voted county seat in
1874, but the county seat was moved back to Montgomery in 1880, after the Houston and
Texas Central was built. In 1889, however, the county seat was moved to the fledgling
community of Conroe, which was situated at the junction of the International-Great Northern and
the newly built Gulf, Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway. The construction of the railroads also
sparked a major period of expansion in the county. Numerous new towns grew up, and the
population, which had risen only slightly since the Civil War, saw a marked increase. Despite
the loss of considerable territory due to the splitting off of several new counties, the number of
residents grew from 6,483 to 10,154 between 1870 and 1880, and population increased to more
than 17,000 over the next 2 decades.
The construction of the railroads also marked the beginnings of the countyâs great
lumbering boom. Commercial lumbering had begun in the county prior to the Civil War, but the
lack of easy access to river or rail transportation severely hampered efforts to exploit the areaâs
rich timber resources. With the arrival of the railroads, however, lumbering quickly developed
into a major industry. By 1882, 45 steam sawmills were in operation, and lumbering emerged
as the countyâs largest source of income within a short time. The lumber boom gave rise to

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

numerous new communities, including Bobville, Cowl Spur, Dobbin, Egypt, Fostoria, Honea,
Karen, Keenan, Mostyn, Leonides, and Security, all of which developed as lumber shipping
points or mill sites. The boom also helped to transform the county in other ways. As late as the
early 1870s, 80% of the county was still covered by thick pine forests. Over the next 4 decades,
much of the county was deforested, permanently altering the landscape and opening the way
for a steady increase in livestock-raising and farming.
The agricultural economy, which had been on the wane since the Civil War, began to
recover in the 1880s. Spurring its growth was the introduction of tobacco, which began to be
planted in large quantities in the 1890s. Much of the tobacco was a fine-grade variety known as
Vuelta Abajo, grown from seeds imported each year from Cuba. The center of the industry was
Willis, which had 7 cigar factories by 1895. High railroad shipping costs and the high initial
investment and labor involved in curing and sweating the tobacco, however, discouraged many
farmers; between 1898 and 1901, the amount of land given over to tobacco production fell
dramatically from more than 1,000 acres to only 70. The subsequent lifting of a US tariff on
Cuban tobacco, which had kept prices artificially high, finally ended the experiment, and no
tobacco was being grown in the county within a few years. The agricultural economy stagnated
at the turn of the century; however, by 1910, it began to show slow but steady growth.
The county, however, experienced a dramatic reversal of fortune in 1932, when oil was
discovered southeast of Conroe. Evidence of oil had been found in the county as early as 1901,
when Santa Fe Railroad engineers drilled a water well and noted traces of oil. Natural gas was
found southwest of Conroe in 1924, and several major oil companies acquired leases in the
area. The initial tests, however, were unsuccessful, and the companies lost interest. In August
1931, however, wildcatter George William Strake began drilling a test well southeast of Conroe
and, on 13 December of the same year, hit oil; by June 1932, Strake had brought in a second,
even larger well, which was spewing out more than 900 barrels daily. The discovery
immediately triggered a tremendous oil boom. Within days, thousands of fortune-seekers,
wildcatters, financiers, roughnecks, and hangers-on flooded the area. The population of Conroe,
estimated at 2,500 in December 1931, blossomed to more than 10,000 within a few months. At
the beginning of 1933, more than 100 wells had been drilled, and more that 25,000 barrels per
day were being produced; by the end of the year, the number of producing wells had grown to
679, and the daily output was more than 52,000 barrels. Oil was subsequently discovered in
several other areas of the county, and the combined oilfields of Montgomery County made it
one the richest oil-producing areas in the nation. Although the vast majority of Montgomery
County residents did not benefit directly from the oil discovery, oil money contributed to a
general prosperity that helped offset the worst effects of the depression. Proceeds from the oil
also helped to remake the face of the county. Roads were graded and paved, new schools
were built, and public buildings and monuments were erected. Conroe experienced a
construction boom as numerous new buildings, including banks, offices, and homes, were
erected with oil money. The population of the county swelled during the boom, growing by
nearly 10,000 between 1930 and 1940, increasing from 14,588 to 23,055. The prosperity
continued during the years of World War II. Oil refineries and a carbon black manufacturing
plant were built, and efforts were intensified to produce as much oil as possible for the war

effort. After the war, oil production declined somewhat, but it has remained one of the countyâs
leading sources of income; in 1990 alone, more than 2.7 million barrels of oil were produced.
In recent years, Montgomery County has become a recreation destination for many
Houston residents. The area, with its abundant lakes and forest, offers numerous opportunities
for hunting, boating, fishing, and hiking. Among the most popular attractions are the Sam
Houston National Forest, W. Goodrich Jones State Forest, Lake Conroe, and Lake Woodlands.
Visitors to the area are also attracted by the shopping opportunities in Conroe, the annual
county fair, and the Conroe Main Street Festival.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted on the THCâs Texas Archeological Sites Atlas Database
(2007) web site indicated that 16 cultural resource sites have been previously recorded within a
2-km (1.2-mi) perimeter of the project area (Table 1). Essentially all of these sites are located
within 300 m (1000 ft) of either Spring Creek or the West Fork of the San Jacinto River. Of
these 16 sites, 2 sites (41MQ52 and 41HR411) have been documented within the proposed
Townsen Road ROW, but are located outside of the USACE jurisdictional areas. As such,
these 2 sites were not formally investigated during the survey phase due to their location
outside of the project area. Based on the Atlas (2007) site data, both sites are located either
within or adjacent to the Chevron Cross Creek Pipeline. The portions of the sites that were
investigated were not considered eligible for inclusion in the NRHP by the initial site recorders.
At present, the sites have likely experienced considerable impact as a result of the construction
of the pipeline. No previously recorded sites were found to exist within the USACE jurisdictional
areas.
Site 41MQ52 was originally documented in 1969 as an aboriginal campsite and was
thought to be a large campsite and possibly 1 of 4 Orcoquiza villages reported in 18th century
documents (Atlas 2007). Later investigations in 1982 and 1994, however, reported finding only
a low density of artifacts consisting mostly of lithic debitage in surficial contexts. The overall
lack of recovered subsurface cultural materials may suggest that this site is a somewhat
ephemeral occupation rather than the large village as was suggested on the site form. Site
41MQ52 is located approximately 160 m (525 ft) north of Spring Creek (USACE crossing #1),
and consequently falls well outside of the previously defined 60 m (200 ft) USACE jurisdictional
boundary.
Site 41HR411 is a multi-component site originally recorded in 1982 and revisited in
1985 and 1994. The site is located on an upland ridge south of Spring Creek approximately 190
m (623 ft) southeast of USACE crossing #6. The site consists of a low-to-moderate density of
historic debris and prehistoric lithic debitage found on the surface within the 18 m (60 ft) ROW of
the Chevron Cross Creek Pipeline. No subsurface artifacts were observed during the recording
of this site.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas within the Proposed 4.5-Mile
Townsen Road Right-of-Way, Montgomery and Harris Counties, Texas

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 4-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed ROW between 1 and 3 August 2006.
This included intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel tests within each of the 6
USACE jurisdictional areas. Many marshy wetland areas were encountered throughout much of
the Townsen Road ROW. However, upon consultation with Horizon wetland biologists, it was
determined that only 6 of these areas possessed the requisite characteristics to be formally
designated as USACE jurisdictional areas. All of the USACE jurisdictional crossings were
subsequently assigned sequential numbers (1 through 6) beginning with Spring Creek and
moving north. The small segment of the ROW that will reside south of Spring Creek was
surveyed last; as such, this jurisdictional crossing was labeled last (crossing #6). All
investigations at each of the USACE jurisdictional areas utilized the corresponding crossing
number when collecting field data. For example, shovel tests at each jurisdictional area were
assigned the corresponding number as well as a specific shovel test number (e.g., shovel tests
in jurisdictional area 4 were labeled ST 4-1, ST 4-2, etc.). Similarly, notes and photographs
were labeled in regard to the respective jurisdictional areas from which they were gathered. In
all, a total of 6 USACE jurisdictional areas were investigated (see Figures 3 through 8).
The TSMASS require a minimum of 3 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring
between 0 to 2 acres in size. Rather than lumping the total acreage of all the USACE
jurisdictional areas together for this specific survey, the Horizon field crew assessed each
USACE jurisdictional area as if it encompassed 1 total acre, although in reality each
jurisdictional area measured considerably less than 1 acre. Because an area measuring 30 m
by 60 m (100 ft long by 200 ft) wide on each side of each waterway was considered to be a
USACE jurisdictional area, the actual acreage at each location equated more to around 0.4 ac
(0.16 ha). This rule, of course, was altered in the case of Spring Creek (USACE crossing #1),
and a larger jurisdictional area (60 m by 60 m [200 ft by 200 ft]) was adopted in order to include
the sandy upland terraces located on either bank. Regardless, the Horizon field crew set out to
excavate a minimum of 4 shovel tests at each USACE jurisdictional area; preferably 4 on each
bank. When assessed in regard to overall acreage, a total of 13 shovel tests would have been
required for the 6.4 ac (3.0 ha) comprising the USACE jurisdictional areas. Horizon exceeded
the minimum survey standards by excavating a total of 72 shovel tests.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for

Chapter 5.0: Survey Methodology

every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate.
The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM
coordinate system and the NAD 83 map datum. The UTM coordinates were later converted to
the NAD 27 map datum so as to conform to the coordinate system most commonly used by the
various regulatory agencies. Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 9. Shovel test data
are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 SURVEY RESULTS

Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey between 1 and 3 August 2006
to locate any cultural resource properties within the USACE jurisdictional areas that potentially
would be impacted by the proposed construction of Townsen Road. This entailed intensive
surface inspection as well as subsurface shovel testing. The intensive cultural resources survey
resulted in the documentation of 1 new prehistoric site, 41MQ208.

6.1

SITE 41MQ208

Site 41MQ208 is an aboriginal open campsite located on an upland terrace situated on
the northern banks of Spring Creek in Montgomery County (Figure 10). Spring Creek is a fairly
shallow and broad waterway flanked by rather steep sandy ridges that form a series of alluvial
terraces. Site 41MQ208 is located on the edge of a T2 terrace that has an elevation of 21 to 24
m above mean sea level (amsl) (70 ft to 80 ft amsl). Dense vegetation consisting of pine and
oak trees interspersed with small patches of open ground allowed for moderate surface visibility
(ca. 40%) throughout much of the site.
Site 41MQ208 was initially discovered based on the recovery of 4 plainware ceramic
body sherds and 6 chert flakes from a single shovel test at depths ranging from 60 to 120 cmbs
(24 to 47 inbs). The artifacts were situated in a homogenous tan sandy matrix. Clayey
sediments generally associated with Pre-Holocene deposits were not encountered on any
portion of the site. Additional shovel testing at 10- to 15-meter intervals around the initial
positive shovel test produced negative results. However, due to the relatively high number of
artifacts that were recovered from the positive shovel test, it was decided that 2 large shovel
tests measuring approximately 50 cm by 50 cm (20 in by 20 in) should be excavated within 5 m
(16 ft) of the initial find. These large shovel tests were excavated to approximately 130 cmbs
(51 inbs) and resulted in the recovery of additional artifacts including 1 plainware ceramic body
sherd (broken into 3 pieces) and 11 chert flakes at depths ranging from 20 to 120 cmbs (8 to 47
inbs).
At present, the distribution of positive and negative shovel tests demarcates a very small
site boundary that measures approximately 12 m E/W by 6 m N/S (39 ft E/W by 20 ft N/S). A
barbed-wire fence marking the edge of the Chevron Cross Creek Pipeline corridor serves as the
eastern boundary of the site. Shovel tests excavated within the boundaries of the pipeline
corridor encountered near-surface clays indicating that the soils had been severely impacted by

the construction of the pipeline. Additional disturbances such as bulldozer push piles were
often encountered along the periphery of the pipeline corridor. One such push pile constitutes
the northern boundary of the site. Shovel tests excavated along the northern edge of this
bulldozer push-pile yielded negative results. The southern boundary of the site coincides with a
steep ridge that slopes dramatically to the south into the Spring Creek floodplain. The western
boundary was fully delineated based on the distribution of positive and negative shovel tests.
Despite the relatively high number of artifacts found (5 ceramic sherds and 17 chert flakes), the
site boundary remains restricted to a relatively small area consisting of only 3 positive shovel
tests all located within approximately 5 to 10 m (16 to 33 ft) of each other.
The presence of ceramics suggests that aboriginal inhabitants of the area began
occupying site 41MQ208 sometime after A.D. 100, the initiation of the Early Ceramic Period
(Aten 1983). The ceramic body sherds found exhibit a sandy paste, which is a characteristic
commonly attributed to the Goose Creek Plain ceramic style typically found in Montgomery
County. Goose Creek sandy paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas in the Early
Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and early part of the Historic period (Aten 1984; Patterson 1995;
Pertulla et al. 1995). Goose Creek Plain ceramic assemblages have temper that is generally
sand grains with clay grit or grog and an absence of bone temper. Surface texture shows
embedded and loose fine to coarse sand grains on the sherd surface. The sherd colors are
mainly dark, varying from grayish-brown, reddish-brown buff, tan, orange-brown, and yellow. In
most cases, the surface finish is poorly smoothed and uneven on the interior and exterior. The
sherds recovered from site 41MQ208 are quarter-sized plain body sherds with a tan or
orange/brown surface. Coarse sand grains are visible both in the cross-section and on the
interior and exterior surfaces.
The usage of ceramic vessels in Southeast Texas is thought to be related to increased
sedentism brought about by a spike in the local aboriginal population (Patterson 1995). Such
behavioral shifts are reflected in the archeological record as an increase in relative artifact
densities as a result of campsites being utilized for longer periods of time. Such campsites
would display more pronounced activity patterns relating to domestic duties that accompany a
more sedentary lifestyle. The use of ceramic vessels generally decreased with the onset of the
Late Prehistoric period when aboriginal groups in the inland coastal region once again adopted
a more mobile lifestyle (Patterson 1995).
With this in mind, several avenues of preliminary interpretation can be pursued regarding
the site type and relative occupation date of site 41MQ208. It should be noted, however, that at
present the entire site has yet to be fully delineated vertically and further investigations might
yield significant cultural materials at greater depths. Additionally, the construction of the nearby
Chevron Cross Creek pipeline could have truncated the site resulting in a fragmented
archeological record. However, given the present findings (ceramics and lithics), it can be
surmised that site 41MQ208, at its very least, is a campsite where aboriginal inhabitants resided
for an undetermined amount of time. Had the site been occupied during the Early Ceramic
Period (A.D. 100-A.D. 600), one would expect to find a high density of artifacts present within a
relatively large area, perhaps coinciding with a topographical feature. By following the same
general train of thought, one could hypothesize that sites occupied after the Early Ceramic

HJN 050161 AR

33

Chapter 6.0: Survey Results

Period in the Late Prehistoric Period or even Historic Period would exhibit more ephemeral
occupational patterns consistent with the short-term habitation scheme characteristic of more
mobile groups. Based on the very small size of site 41MQ208 (12 m E/W by 6 m N/S) as well
as the lack of observed cultural features and the relatively low density of artifacts, initial
deductions point to a later occupation date perhaps during the Late Prehistoric Period (A.D.
600-1500).
These assumptions, of course, are subject to change should additional
investigations within and adjacent to the site boundaries yield significant findings. A sketch map
and general overview photographs of site 41MQ208 are presented in Figures 11 to 16.
The cultural deposits on site 41MQ208 were not adequately assessed to determine if
deeply buried subsurface cultural materials were present at depths beyond shovel testing
capabilities. As such, the NRHP eligibility status of site 41MQ208 remained undetermined after
the initial pedestrian survey was conducted. As site 41MQ208 is to be potentially impacted by
the construction of the proposed Townsen Road, Horizon recommended NRHP testing
investigations at this site prior to construction in order to determine the character and nature of
the deposits, as well as its NRHP eligibility.

7.0 INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

In August of 2006, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 6
USACE jurisdictional areas located within the 7.2-km (4.5-mi) Townsen Road ROW. This
survey resulted in the documentation of 1 new prehistoric archeological site, 41MQ208. Site
41MQ208 is an aboriginal encampment located on an upland terrace situated on the northern
banks of Spring Creek just west of the Chevron Cross Creek Pipeline corridor. Plainware
ceramic body sherds and lithic debitage were recovered from 3 tightly grouped shovel tests at
depths ranging from 20 to 120 cmbs (8 to 47 inbs). The lithic specimens recovered from the site
are clearly of aboriginal manufacture, although none are temporally diagnostic. The ceramic
body sherds found exhibit a sandy paste, which is a characteristic commonly attributed to the
Goose Creek Plain ceramic style typically found in Montgomery County. Goose Creek sandy
paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and
early part of the Historic period (Aten 1984; Patterson 1995; Pertulla et al. 1995). Given the
small sample size and the lack of explicit technological or stylistic traits, it is difficult to provide a
more specific occupation date based on the ceramic assemblage alone.
The artifacts were recovered from a homogenous tan sandy matrix. Clayey sediments
generally associated with Pre-Holocene deposits were not encountered on any portion of the
site. At present, the distribution of positive and negative shovel tests demarcates a very small
site boundary that measures approximately 12 m E/W by 6 m N/S (39 ft E/W by 20 ft N/S). No
cultural features were observed during the recording of this site.
Investigations conducted within the remaining jurisdictional areas (crossings #2 to 6)
produced negative findings. Aside from Spring Creek, the jurisdictional stream crossings
traversed by the proposed Townsen Road were found to be primarily ephemeral in nature and
were generally accompanied by marshy wetlands. Additionally, clayey sediments were
frequently encountered along the banks of these small streams. Shovel testing therefore
constituted an adequate survey technique for identifying cultural resources in these areas.

7.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Due to the depth of the alluvial deposits on site 41MQ208, the survey-level
investigations were not sufficient to allow for a formal determination of the NRHP eligibility

HJN 050161 AR

39

Section 7.0: Initial Recommendations

status of the site. As such, its NRHP eligibility status was declared undetermined. Because of
this, Horizon recommended additional mechanical trenching investigations within the alluvial
terraces where site 41MQ208 is located in order to assess the vertical extent, character, and
integrity of the siteâs cultural deposits, as well as to formally define the siteâs NRHP eligibility
status.
Additionally, the TSMASS require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas
with the potential to contain buried cultural materials at depths below those that shovel tests are
capable of reaching (approximately 1 m [3 ft] below surface). The portions of the Townsen
Road that traverse Spring Creek and its adjacent terraces were found to contain deep alluvial
deposits. Shovel tests in these areas were excavated to a maximum feasible depth of 1 m (3
ft); however, the bottom of the sandy matrix was not reached in many areas. Given the
presence of deeply buried, intact sandy deposits near Spring Creek within the USACE
jurisdictional boundary, Horizon also recommended mechanical trenching within the alluvial
terraces of Spring Creek to determine if additional cultural resources are present at depths
greater than 1 m (3 ft).
Upon consultation with the THC, additional trenching efforts were requested (by the
THC) on the previously recorded multi-component site 41HR411 and 41MQ208. Site 41HR411
is located on the upland slopes approximately 960 ft (293 m) southeast of Spring Creek and 240
m (790 ft) southeast of USACE jurisdictional crossing #6 (see Figure 1). Previous investigations
at site 41HR411 were restricted to the then-proposed Chevron Cross Creek Pipeline corridor.
As such, the character and the eligibility status of site 41HR411 had not been adequately
assessed. The THC recommended that backhoe trenching efforts be initiated on site 41HR411
in order to determine if the site boundaries overlap with the previously defined USACE
jurisdictional crossing #6. In that case, the USACE would afford protection to all portions of the
site, even if it is only partially within its jurisdiction.
Investigations conducted within the remaining jurisdictional areas (crossings #2 to 6)
produced negative findings. Aside from Spring Creek, the jurisdictional stream crossings
traversed by the proposed Townsen Road were found to be primarily ephemeral in nature and
were generally accompanied by marshy wetlands. Additionally, clayey sediments were
frequently encountered along the banks of these small streams. Shovel testing therefore
constituted an adequate survey technique for identifying cultural resources in these areas. No
additional investigations were recommended for these areas. Cultural resources clearance was
recommended for these USACE jurisdictional areas and the THC concurred with these findings,
stating that work should be allowed to proceed in those areas away from Spring Creek in a letter
dated 4 January 2007.

8.0 TRENCHING METHODOLOGY

To determine the NRHP eligibility of sites 41MQ208 and 41HR411 and test the deep
alluvial sands associated with Spring Creek, Horizon conducted backhoe trenching efforts on 1
and 2 March 2007. These investigations consisted of the excavation of a total of 4 backhoe
trenches (BHTs): 1 on the southern banks of Spring Creek (BHT 1), 1 on the upland terrace
within the previously recorded site 41HR411 (BHT 2), 1 within the previously determined
boundary of site 41MQ208 (BHT 3), and 1 in the deep alluvial deposits directly adjacent to the
northern banks of Spring Creek (BHT 4) (Figure 17). The trench excavations were closely
monitored for exposed subsurface deposits, and all excavated spoil was shovel-sorted to
determine if cultural materials were present. All trenches measured a minimum of 5 m (16 ft) in
length and were excavated to sterile subsoil, clayey Pre-Holocene deposits, or to the maximum
depth possible. Following the excavation of each trench, 1 profile was cleaned, described,
photographed, and mapped. Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land
forms, backhoe trenches, cultural material observed (if any), etc. Digital photographs with a
photo log were also completed as appropriate. The location of each backhoe trench was
recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 27 map
datum.

9.0 TRENCHING RESULTS

These investigations consisted of the excavation of a total of 4 trenches: 1 within the
previously determined boundary of site 41MQ208, 1 in the deep alluvial deposits directly
adjacent to the northern banks of Spring Creek, 1 on the southern banks of Spring Creek, and 1
on the upland terrace within the previously recorded site 41HR411. The backhoe trenches
excavated on either bank of Spring Creek and within previously recorded site 41HR411
produced negative findings. In fact, site 41HR411 appears to have been so severely impacted
by construction activities associated with several nearby pipelines that Horizon archeologists
failed to find any cultural materials in the vicinity either in surface or subsurface contexts.
Additionally, dense clayey sediments were observed at relatively shallow depths ranging from
20-45 cmbs (8 to 18 inbs) on the upland formation where site 41HR411 is located. Given the
near-surface nature of the clayey deposits on site 41HR411, it is highly unlikely that any
previously buried culturally significant features have remained intact after years of invasive
modern disturbances and subsequent erosion.
Trenching investigations conducted within the boundaries of site 41MQ208 resulted in
the recovery of 3 small chert flakes. The lithic artifacts were found in a homogenous tan sandy
matrix at depths ranging from 30 to 110 cmbs (12 to 43 inbs). Trenching was originally
recommended on site 41MQ208 due to the potential for significant cultural materials at depths
beyond shovel testing capabilities. However, the subsequent recovery of artifacts only from the
upper 110 cm (43 in) of sediment indicates that deeper cultural materials and/or features are
likely not present. As such, the trenching efforts on site 41MQ208 succeeded in delineating the
vertical extent of the site and in doing so reinforced the adequateness of the original survey
efforts. In other words, due to the lack of cultural materials or features at greater depths (below
120 cm) in the backhoe trench, it can be stated that the vertical and horizontal boundaries of
site 41MQ208 have been confidently defined. In general, the testing investigations on site
41MQ208 revealed sparse prehistoric deposits with no artifacts observed below the cultural
zone (i.e., 20-120 cmbs [8 to 47 in]) previously identified during the original survey efforts.
Additionally, the site is situated directly adjacent to a wide pipeline ROW, which likely disturbed
at least a portion of the site in the past, resulting in a fragmented archeological record. A brief
description of each trench is provided below.

BHT 1 (Figures 18 and 19; see also Figure 17)
BHT 1 was excavated on the southern banks of Spring Creek within the recently cleared
proposed Townsen Road ROW. The area south of Spring Creek is dominated by low-lying
terraces that form an undulating floodplain incised by braided tributaries and swampy areas.
The trench was oriented east-west and measured 5 m (16 ft) in length by 0.6 m (2.0 ft) in width.
It was excavated to a depth of 2.5 m (8.2 ft) and consisted of relatively homogenous alluvial
deposits. Due to the proximity of the trench to Spring Creek, the deeper sediments were found
to be moderately saturated, indicating that the water table was not far below. No cultural
materials were observed during the excavation of the trench. The resulting profile is described
below.
0-80 cm:

- loose, very pale brown fine sand
- no artifacts

80-200 cm:

- loose, very moist light grayish-brown fine sand
- no artifacts

200-250 cm: - saturated pale gray sandy clay loam with reddish-brown iron staining
- no artifacts

Section 9.0: Trenching Results

BHT 2 (Figures 20 and 21; see also Figure 17)
BHT 2 was excavated on the eastern slopes of an upland formation within the proposed
Townsen Road ROW in the supposed location of the previously recorded site 41HR411. As
mentioned previously, site 41HR411 was originally recorded in 1982 and was subsequently
revisited in 1985 and 1994. Upon close examination of the THCâs Atlas site forms, it became
evident that the exact location of the site centroid was found to differ in each of the 3 site forms.
Generally speaking, in all 3 cases, the bulk of the cultural materials that composed site
41HR411 were found to exist in surficial contexts due primarily to the presence of near-surface
clays. With this in mind, prior to the excavation of the backhoe trench, the Horizon field crew
conducted an intensive surface inspection as well the excavation of 2 shovel tests on the upland
landform where site 41HR411 was reported to exist. However, no evidence of cultural materials
was observed on the surface or within the 2 excavated shovel tests. As one can imagine, the
discrepancies between the 3 site forms and the lack of surface artifacts made it difficult to
determine where the backhoe trench should be located in order to adequately assess the extent
to which site 41HR411 might stretch into the currently proposed Townsen Road ROW. The
location of the backhoe trench was finally determined based on careful consideration of the
surrounding topography, site forms, nearby disturbances, and the location of the projected
undertaking. The trench was oriented southeast-northwest and measured 5 m (16 ft) in length
by 0.6 m (2 ft) in width. It was excavated to a depth of 0.65 m (2 ft). The resulting profile is
described below.
0-45 cm:

- moist light grayish-brown sandy clay with reddish-brown clayey mottles
- no artifacts

45-65 cm:

- dense, rocky, saturated Beaumont clay
- no artifacts

BHT 3 (Figures 22 and 23; see also Figure 17)
BHT 3 was excavated on an upland alluvial terrace overlooking the northern bank of
Spring Creek within the boundaries of the newly recorded site 41MQ208. In contrast to the
southern banks of Spring Creek, the area north of Spring Creek is made up of a series of steep
terraces that eventually level out to form a broad upland formation. Cultural bearing deposits
were found on the T2 terrace located adjacent to an incised drainage. The initial survey of the
proposed ROW encountered cultural materials consisting of non-diagnostic lithic artifacts and
sandy paste ceramic body sherds at depths ranging from 20 to 120 cmbs (8 to 47 inbs).
Additional cultural materials (3 chert flakes) were recovered during the trenching efforts;
however, none were observed below the previously defined cultural zone (i.e., 20-120 cmbs).
The lack of observed features and the overall sparseness of cultural materials suggest that this
site was used only as a short-term encampment. The trench was oriented northeast-southwest
and measured 5 m (16 ft) in length by 0.6 m (2 ft) in width. It was excavated to a depth of 2.5 m
(8.2 ft). The resulting profile is described below.
0-30 cm:

- loose, light grayish-brown fine sand
- no artifacts

30-250 cm:

- fine pale brown sand
- 1 chert flake at 30-50 cmbs
- 1 chert flake at 50-70 cmbs
- 1 chert flake at 90-110 cmbs

BHT 4 (Figures 24 and 25; see also Figure 17)
BHT 4 was excavated within the T0 terrace directly adjacent to the northern bank of
Spring Creek in the recently cleared proposed Townsen Road ROW. Similar to BHT 2
excavated on the southern banks of Spring Creek, BHT 4 was devoid of cultural materials and
sediments were found to be increasingly saturated with depth. Due to the low-lying nature of
the T0 terraces on either side of Spring Creek, it is likely that these areas have a history of
being frequently inundated, resulting in highly volatile deposits. As such, despite the presence
of deep alluvial sediments, it seems prudent to assume that these areas have a low probability
for harboring cultural materials. Rather, aboriginals likely targeted areas of higher elevation
outside of the active floodplain. This is evidenced by the presence of culture bearing deposits
that constitute site 41MQ208 located on the upland margin.
The trench was oriented northeast-southwest and measured 5 m (16 ft) in length by 0.6
m (2.0 ft) in width. It was excavated to a depth of 2.9 m (9.4 ft). The resulting profile is
described below.

10.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

10.1

SUMMARY

In August 2006 and March 2007, Horizon conducted a variety of archeological
investigations including intensive pedestrian survey, trenching, and NRHP eligibility testing
throughout the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed Townsen Road ROW in
Montgomery and Harris counties, Texas. These investigations resulted in the documentation of
1 newly recorded and 1 previously recorded archeological site. The eligibility status of the
newly recorded prehistoric site 41MQ208 was declared undetermined at the end of the survey
investigations due to the potential for cultural materials at depths beyond shovel testing
capabilities. NRHP eligibility testing efforts were subsequently initiated within the boundaries of
the site as well as along the alluvial terraces adjacent to the banks of Spring Creek. At the
request of the THC, additional trenching investigations were targeted at the previously recorded
multi-component site 41HR411 located on the upland slopes southeast of Spring Creek. The
results are summarized below.

10.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Ultimately, management decisions regarding cultural resource properties are a function
of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs. Cultural
resources are usually evaluated according to criteria established to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP. Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the
criteria presented in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR Â§60.4(a-d). The
4 criteria of eligibility are applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and
related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
[T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
[T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,

HJN 050161 AR

53

Section 10.0: Summary and Recommendations
[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,
[T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history (U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service) (36 CFR Â§60.4).

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For a cultural resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

10.3

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

To determine the NRHP eligibility of sites 41MQ208 and 41HR411 and test the deep
alluvial sands associated with Spring Creek, Horizon conducted backhoe trenching efforts on 1
and 2 March 2007. The backhoe trenches excavated on either bank of Spring Creek and within
previously recorded site 41HR411 produced negative findings. In fact, site 41HR411 appears to
have been so severely impacted by construction activities associated with several nearby
pipelines that Horizon archeologists failed to find any cultural materials in the vicinity either in
surface or subsurface contexts. It appears as if site 41HR411 has deteriorated considerably
over time and presently absolutely no evidence of prehistoric or historic artifacts were identified
during the field efforts.
Due to the total lack of observed cultural materials, features, or
preserved subsurface organic materials, the investigated area of site 41HR411 does not appear
to possess significant potential to contribute to an enhanced understanding of the prehistoric
past under Criterion D of the NRHP, and the site does not possess characteristics warranting
eligibility under Criteria A, B, or C of the NRHP. As such, it is Horizonâs opinion that site
41HR411 remains ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further work is recommended.

Testing investigations conducted within the boundaries of site 41MQ208 failed to
document any deeply buried cultural deposits. In general, the site consists of sparse prehistoric
deposits in fine sandy loam that lack cultural features or preserved organic materials.
Additionally, the site is situated directly adjacent to a wide pipeline ROW, which likely disturbed
at least a portion of the site in the past, resulting in a fragmented archeological record.
Furthermore, the sparse deposits of site 41MQ208 are similar to those on other sites in the area
that have been tested by Horizon in the past with comparable results (Brownlow 2003 and
2005). With this in mind, it is Horizonâs opinion that site 41MQ208 does not appear to possess
significant potential to contribute to an enhanced understanding of the prehistoric past under
Criterion D of the NRHP, and the site does not possess characteristics warranting eligibility
under Criteria A, B, or C of the NRHP. As such, it is Horizonâs opinion that site 41MQ208 is
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further work is recommended.

10.4

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of these investigations, it is Horizonâs opinion that the construction
of the proposed Townsen Road ROW will have no effect on any significant cultural resources
within the USACE jurisdictional areas. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance
be granted for the USACE jurisdictional areas within the proposed Townsen Road ROW.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the facility, even in previously surveyed area, all work should cease immediately
and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
