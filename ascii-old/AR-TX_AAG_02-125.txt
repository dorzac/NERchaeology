ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the proposed 8,000 square foot expansion project for the Texas
Ranger Museum at the City of Waco, McLennan County, Texas was performed by American
Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G.) in October 2006. The project area is located on the south side of
the Brazos River, and approximately 200 meters east of Interstate 35. Michael R. Bradle served as
the Principal Investigator. This study was carried out under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4255.
The project area was investigated using the pedestrian survey method supported by two backhoe
trenches and a grader. The First Street Cemetery is located immediately south of the proposed
expansion area and there was a strong possibility for additional unmarked graves to be present in the
terrace below where the expansion project is planned. The entire proposed expansion area was
scraped with the use of a grader and backhoe. No burials were encountered during this project. In the
course of conducting scraping operations, legal counsel for the City of Waco found evidence that
graves had been present on this same terrace but all had been disinterred and moved in 1968.
Evidence of historic dumping and debris was present. First Street Cemetery area was included with
previously recorded site 41ML238. The portion of 41ML238 examined during this project is not
considered eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or worthy of
designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) and it is recommended that construction be
allowed to proceed as planned. No other artifacts were collected, therefore, no curation was made.

INTRODUCTION
The Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum (City of Waco) proposes to build an expansion
immediately southeast of their current location consisting of 8,000 square feet of additional buildings
in Waco, McLennan County, Texas (Figure 1). The area investigated was .18 acre in size (8,000
square feet). This study was performed under the auspices of Antiquities Permit number 4255. The
project area is depicted on the Waco East 7.5' U.S.G.S topographic quadrangle (Figure 2). Michael
R. Bradle served as the Principal Investigator and Gilbert T. Bernhardt was the Geoarchaeologist.
According to the site records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
Austin, Texas, there are no previously recorded sites in the current project area. The Texas Ranger
Hall of Fame and Museum, by and through the City of Waco, sponsored the project and contracted
with American Archaeology Group LLC to perform these services.
The research design was coordinated with the Archeology Division, Texas Historical
Commission, and the City of Waco and was designed to intensively survey the project area in order
to identify any potential graves present as an extension of the First Street Cemetery through scraping
operations.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
McLennan County is located within the Balconian biotic province as defined by Blair
(1950:112-116) and includes the Gulf coastal plain from the Atlantic Ocean to eastern Texas. The
size and location of this province is described below by Blair (1950:112):
The Balconian province, as here defined, takes in most of the Edwards Plateau as
limited by Sellards, Adkins and Plummer (1933): (Figs. 3 and 4), the Lampasas Cut
Plain and Comanche Plateau of Raisz (1939 [cited as 1946 in Blair]), and the Central
Mineral or Llano Uplift region. That part of the Edwards Plateau lying west of the
Pecos, and often referred to as the Stockton Plateau, is not included, but is referred
instead to as the Chihuahuan province.
Climate
The Balconian climate is characterized by a decrease in rainfall from east to west. Bell
County is located in the eastern half of the province which has been classified by Thornwaite (1948)
as dry subhumid, mesothermal with average annual potential evapotranspiration of between 39.27
and 44.88 inches. The annual rainfall for Bell County is 34 inches, the January minimum
temperature is 37 degrees Fahrenheit, the July maximum temperature is 96 degrees Fahrenheit, and
the growing season is 258 days (Kingston and Harris 1983).
Vegetation
According to Blair (1950:113), the most characteristic plant association of this province is a
scrub forest of Mexican cedar (Juniperus mexicana), Texas oak (Quercus texana), stunted live oak
(Quercus virginiana), and various less numerous species.
The project area is also located well within the Prairies Vegetation Region and the Edwards
Plateau Vegetation Region (Gould 1962). Vegetational species characteristic of the region include
Plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformus), Texas oak (Quercus texana), ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei),
honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), cottonwood (Populus
deltoides), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), elm (Ulmus spp.), sumacs (Rhus spp.), Texas persimmon
(Diospyros texana), agarita (Berberis trifoliolata), Texas stillingia (Stillingia texana), yucca (Yucca
spp.), Texas prickly pear (Opuntia Lindheimeri), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), and American beautyberry
(Callicarpa americana). Grasslands include seep mulhy (Muhlenbergia reverchnoii), Canadian
wildrye (Elymus canadensis), dichanthelium (Dichanthelium spp.), Texas grama (Bouteloua
rigidiseta), and red grama (Bouteloua hirsuta). The project area is now primarily overgrown with
juniper and mixed oaks and grasses.

Hydrology
The project area is located within the Brazos River drainage basin, one of the largest rivers in
the state. The nearest major drainage to the project area is White Rock Creek, which flows into the
Brazos River. White Rock Creek flows in a general north-south direction approximately 1200
meters to the west of the current project area.
Wildlife
The project area is located well within the Balconian Biotic Province which is
characteristically represented by a general mixture of fauna from nearby surrounding provinces
(Blair 1950). Typical species found within the project area include White-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), cotton-tailed rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus
novemcinctus), black-tailed jack rabbit (Lepus californicus), raccoon (Prycon lotor), hispid cotton
rat (Sigmodon hispidus), wild turkey (Melagris gallopavo), morning dove (Zenaida macroura),
scissor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus), northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), western
coach whip (Masticophis flagellum testaceus), and the bull snake (Pituophis melanoleucus sayi).
Soils
Two soil series as shown in Figure 2 were located in the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and
Museum Expansion study area as depicted on sheet 28 of the Soil Survey of McLennan County,
Texas (Miller and Greenwade 2001): Weswood Series (Wd) and Yahola Series (Ya). Both soils
are alluvial soils that formed on the Brazos floodplain. Yahola soils are found on the natural
levee and Weswood soils are formed in over bank deposited sediments. The soils have been
highly modified by road, park, and cemetery construction. Both soils have a high potential for
buried intact assemblages of artifacts. Both soils have a relatively low potential for surface
assemblages of artifacts due to construction and pedestrian activities.
Weswood silt loam consists of very deep, near level, well drained, loamy soils on flood
plains. The solum is 97 to 112 centimeters thick. Soils in the Weswood series are fine-silty,
mixed, thermic Fluventic Ustochrepts (Miller and Greenwade 2001). The A horizon is a 15
centimeters thick, reddish brown, brown, light brown, yellowish red, or light reddish brown silt
loam. The soil has weak, fine, granular structure. The horizon is strongly effervescent and
moderately alkaline. The B horizons are reddish brown, light reddish brown, yellowish red, or
reddish yellow, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. The horizons range in thickness from 71
to 97 centimeters. The soil has weak fine and medium granular and sub angular blocky structure
in the upper horizon to weak medium to fine sub angular blocky structure in the middle to lower
horizons. The B horizons are violently effervescent and moderately alkaline. The C horizon is
approximately 91 centimeters thick, reddish brown, light reddish brown, light brown, reddish
yellow, or pink, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam. In some pedons it has thin strata of very
fine sandy loam, clay, or silty loam. The horizon has slightly hard, friable, massive structure.

The horizon is violently effervescent and moderately alkaline with common films and threads of
calcium carbonate.
The Yahola series consist of well drained, soils on bottom lands. The unit, Yahola very
fine sandy loam (Ya), is a near level, alluvial, Holocene-age, soil found along long and narrow
areas paralleling the Brazos River. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The soil has been
identified as coarse-loamy, mixed (calcareous), thermic Udic Ustifluvents (Miller and
Greenwade 2001). The A horizon is a 0 to 51 centimeters thick, and has brown, dark brown,
pale brown, light brown, reddish brown, strong brown, or yellowish red colored, very fine sandy
loam or loam. The soil has weak, fine, granular structure. The horizon is slightly hard, friable,
calcareous, and moderately alkaline. The C horizon is approximately 80 to140 centimeter thick,
has light reddish brown, reddish brown, strong brown, light brown, brown, reddish yellow,
yellowish red or pink, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or loamy fine sand. The C
horizon may have thin strata of coarse sand, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay. The horizon,
generally, has massive structure. The horizon is hard to slightly hard, very friable, calcareous,
and moderately alkaline (Miller and Greenwade 2001).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
McLennan County is located in the North Central Texas cultural-geographical region as
defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:76). This area is referred to as Central Texas by most archaeologists
and is rich in archaeological sites.
Summaries relevant to the prehistory of McLennan County and vicinity have been prepared
by various archaeologists. Bell et al (1967) addressed historic Wichita Indian sites in the area,
Duffield (1959), Jackson (1984), Prikryl et al (1985) and Story and Shafer (1965) conducted work in
the Lake Waco area (Waco Reservoir) of which most of our known data for the area came from
these investigations. Avocational archaeologists contributed greatly to early information for the area
including Bryan (1930, 1931, and 1935), Meroney (1936), Perkins (1956), Redder (1985), Watt
(1938, 1953, 1956, and 1969). Story (1985) discussed a historic Indian burial. Other regional studies
that have yielded interpretations for Central Texas archaeology which applies to McLennan County
are primarily as a result of work at Fort Hood in Bell and Coryell counties, Texas (Guderjan et al.
1980; Skinner et al. 1981, 1984; Thomas 1978; Roemer et al. 1985; Carlson et al. 1986), Belton
Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964), the Youngsport site (Shafer 1963), and Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir
(Shafer et al. 1964; Sorrow et al. 1967). Summaries of the region have been published by Suhm
(1960), Weir (1976), and Prewitt (1981, 1985). Most recently, two thorough articles concerning
Central Texas were published in Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society.
These works, entitled "Forty Years of Archeology in Central Texas," by Michael B. Collins (1995)
and "Implications of Environmental Diversity in the Central Texas Archeological Region" by Linda
Wootan Ellis, G. Lain Ellis, and Charles D. Frederick (1995), represent a major synthesis of the vast
amount of collected data for the region. The following discussion is taken primarily from the works
cited above.
Paleoindian Period
Although, according to Willey and Phillips (1958:80), problems exist with the term
"Paleoindian," it is so widely accepted that it is used in this discussion. Paleoindian typically refers
to those cultures which were oriented toward big game hunting with food collecting not a major
pursuit. Eileen Johnson (1977:65-77) states that it has been erroneously stereotyped as a migratory
systematic big game procurement adaptation. Collins (1995:381) argues that for subsistence in
Clovis times, Paleoindians exploited a diverse fauna base that not only included large herbivores
such as mammoth, bison, and horse but also included smaller animals such as water turtles, land
tortoises, alligator, mice, badger, and raccoon. At Kincaid Rockshelter, a paved floor suggests that
the inhabitants of this site returned to the same site as part of a regular hunting and gathering strategy
in contrast with nomadic hunters who only pursued big game. It is, therefore, assumed that an array
of plants presumably also constituted part of Clovis subsistence (Collins 1990; Collins et al. 1989)
According to Skinner et al. (1981:13), the Paleoindian period is one of the least understood
time periods in Central Texas prehistory, primarily because few sites have been excavated. As of
7

1985, for example, only two Paleoindian sites had been reported for Bell County (Biesaart et al.
1985:125). Evidence of this period often occurs in the form of surface collected materials found
over much of Central Texas. At Fort Hood, this period is represented by distinctive projectile points
found in multicomponent surface sites and as isolated finds (Carlson et al. 1986:15). Generally, it is
believed that this period lasted from about 10,000 B.C. until 6000 B.C. Diagnostic artifacts of the
period include dart point types Angostura, Clovis, Folsom, Golondrina, and Plainview as defined by
Suhm and Jelks (1962) and Turner and Hester (1985).
These early sites are often found on old terraces of major river drainages and may be more
distant from major streams than some more recent occupations (Bryan 1931). Some rockshelters,
such as the Levi site, were intensively occupied even though they are located a considerable distance
from major rivers. The only example of a rockshelter in Central Texas immediately adjacent to a
major drainage known to contain Paleoindian occupation is the Horn Shelter (41BQ46) in Bosque
County (Redder 1985).
Archaic Period
The Archaic represents a broad cultural time period which lasted from approximately 8500
Before Present (B.P.) to 1250 B.P. in Central Texas. According to Prewitt (1981:71), "The Archaic
Stage dominates all other remains in Central Texas." Prewitt (1981) has subdivided the Archaic into
eleven phases. LeRoy Johnson (1987) has questioned the validity of the phase concept as used by
Prewitt, especially the phases occurring before the Middle Archaic. These have been grouped into
Early, Middle, Late, and Terminal periods by Carlson et al. (1986:15).
According to Prewitt (1981:77-78), during the Early Archaic there was a "strong orientation
toward the gathering aspect rather than the hunting, and a mobile population was of low density."
This occurred during the Circleville, San Geronimo, and Jarrell phases (8500 B.P. - 5000 B.P.). In
the Middle Archaic, food gathering had become very specialized as evidenced by the presence of
numerous burned rock middens/mounds (Prewitt 1981:78-80). The Middle Archaic is seen by
Prewitt to have taken place during the Oakalla, Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, and Round Rock phases
(5000 B.P. - 2600 B.P.). An overall decrease in burned rock middens took place during the Late
Archaic. Bison were important as a food resource, but did not dominate subsistence activities
(Prewitt 1981:80-81). The Late Archaic occurred during the San Marcos and Uvalde phases (2600
B.P. - 1750 B.P.). The Terminal Archaic, according to the classification by Carlson et al. (1986),
includes the Twin Sisters and Driftwood phases (1750 B.P. - 1250 B.P.). An increase in the
importance of gathering and an apparent peak in site density seems to have occurred during Prewitt's
(1981:82) Driftwood phase.
According to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al. 1985) published by the Office of the
State Archeologist in 1985, the prehistoric site inventory for Bell County was heavily skewed
towards the Archaic. Of the 197 recorded sites, 2 were classified as Paleoindian, 10 Early Archaic,
37 Middle Archaic, 32 Late Archaic, 52 General Archaic, and 29 Late Prehistoric. These statistics
8

reflect that Bell County was occupied mainly during the Archaic period which, according to Prewitt
(1981:Figure 3) lasted from 8500 years B.P. to 1250 B.P. This is supported by the statement by
Collins (1995:383) that "two-thirds of the prehistory of Central Texas is 'Archaic' in character."
Late Prehistoric Period
This period has been referred by some as the Neo-American Stage (Suhm et al. 1954), Neoarchaic (Prewitt 1981), and Post-Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994). Technological changes are the
primary distinguishing characteristics of this stage. The Austin (1250 B.P. - 650 B.P.) and Toyah
(650 B.P. - 200 B.P.) phases belong to this stage of prehistory. During this time arrow points first
appeared as well as ceramics and possibly horticulture.
According to Collins (1995:385) there is now evidence that only the bow and arrow
appeared initially in Central Texas; pottery was added later, and agriculture developed last and was
of minor importance. Because Late Prehistoric groups continued to practice hunting and gathering,
a division or two sub-periods seem to have taken place. These are referred to as early and late by
Collins (1995:385) with the break between the long-standing Archaic period and the Late Prehistoric
period occurring at circa 800 B.P. when Toyah replaced Austin as the prevailing archeological
manifestation.
The most obvious change that emerged at the beginning of the Late Prehistoric period is the
introduction of the bow and arrow and decreased use of the atlatl or spear thrower. Otherwise,
subsistence lifeways in the Late Prehistoric were probably little different from those in the earlier
Archaic period (Prewitt 1981:74; Weir 1976). A chronological model by Dillehay (1974) of bison
presence and absence periods on the southern plains suggests that bison were present during the
Toyah phase but not during the preceding Austin phase.
Protohistoric Period
The time from initial Spanish exploration of the Texas Gulf Coast in 1519 to the first
missions in 1691 is labeled “protohistoric.” This era is “…the time when Europeans were in the
region, but their influence was not manifested in the aboriginal material culture nor in the
archeological record” (Johnson and Holliday 1995:521). By this definition, this period begins in
central Texas when Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca’s shipwrecked party trekked from Galveston
westward across vast stretches of unknown territory that became central and western Texas
(Smyrl 1996a).
For the next 150 years, Spanish explorers appeared sporadically in central Texas. The
next Spanish party to pass through the region was the Moscoso expedition. This group of
Spaniards stranded in Florida is theorized to have approached within 50 miles south of present
McLennan lands along the trail that became the Old San Antonio Road in 1542 (Bruseth
1996:852). Up to the 1690s, there was no permanent presence of Europeans within present-day
9

Texas. There was little direct impact on the daily lives of aboriginal cultures living in present
McLennan County.
During this period, Texas was occupied by many aboriginal groups, including: Caddo,
Jumano, and Tonkawa (Newcomb 1999). Trade is known to have existed between the Caddo of
eastern Texas and the Jumano of western Texas. Settled in between them were the Tonkawa in
the middle region of Texas. Of historically known tribes, only the Tonkawa likely were in the
McLennan area since before the seventeenth century (Smyrl 1996a). Having inhabited the
eastern Edwards Plateau through the Brazos bottoms, the Tonkawa lived along streams and
rivers, subsisting on deer, rabbit, skunk, rat, land tortoise, rattlesnake, and fish. They gathered
herbs, roots, fruit, prickly pear tunas, acorns, and pecans. Deer skins and pecans were
particularly popular trade items with Europeans (Newcomb 1999:133-140). The Tonkawa
remained aligned with the Lipan Apache, which put them at odds with the Comanche and their
Wichita-speaking allies, the Wacos and Tawakonis (Aten 1983:32 and Newcomb 1999:268).
Historic Period
Collins (1995:386) divides the “Historic period” of central Texas into three sub-periods:
early, middle, and late. During the first two sub-periods, aspects of both indigenous and
European cultures co-existed. During the third, Indians lost their traditional homelands, ending
up on Federal reservations (Bradle et al. 1997:8). Since Collins does not deal with the twentieth
century, the past hundred years are identified as the “Modern Era.”
Native American occupations throughout the historic period are often identified by the
occurrence of glass beads, gun parts, gun flints, metal projectile points, and European
manufactured ceramics (Bradle et al. 1997:8). The archival search located Historic Indian sites
in McLennan County including the Gas Plant Site, the Stone Site, and the Waco Village Site. At
site 41CV1 located along the Leon River in adjacent Coryell County, a blue glass bead was
found with one of the burials (Jackson 1931). A steel arrow point was recovered as an isolated
find on Horse Creek in the east corner of Coryell County (Campbell 1952), just a few miles west
of the McLennan line. None of these historic-period finds have been identified with specific
tribes or within defined sub-periods.
Early Historic (1691 – c.1720)
Under Collins’ framework, the historic period commences with establishment of
continuous contact between indigenous peoples and Spanish Europeans (Newcomb 1999:135136). This contact began when the Spanish established their first missions on the northeastern
frontier of Mexico (Collins 1995:386). In response to French incursions embodied by LaSalle’s
ill-fated colony of Fort Saint Louis in 1685, Spain ordered a highway to be built to enforce
Spanish control over Texas. Called El Camino Real (The King’s Highway), this engineering and
military project was headed by Captain Alonso de Leon in 1688. The present-day State
10

Highways OSR and 21 follow this original highway, which approached within 50 miles of
McLennan territory. De Leon left “a bull, a cow, a stallion, and a mare at each river he crossed”
(Scarbrough 1973:54).
In 1691 Domingo Terán de los Ríos led churchmen and soldiers across El Camino Real
to establish missions in east Texas, bringing more cattle (Casteneda 1936: I, 362 and Bancroft
1884:391). While these first missions closed after a couple of years, El Camino Real remained
in steady use. Within a few years, two branch roads (Gard 1954) brought Spanish traffic even
closer to the county. During the next 30 years, Spanish and French traders exchanged their
goods with Indians of various tribes and bringing thousands of sheep, horses, and mules,
(Casteneda 1936: II, 42, 51). This dramatic increase of livestock and trade ware provided
indigenous peoples new sources of meat, skins, and transportation, causing irreversible changes
in their cultures (Smyrl 1996a).
The Lipan Apache entered central Texas from the Great Plains during this sub-period.
They followed key animal resources in their migrations (Newcomb 1999). Their arrival altered
the pre-existing cultural make-up of central Texas.
Middle Historic (c.1720 – c.1800)
This next sub-period coincides with re-establishment of a larger mission network
spanning the entire present-day Texas. Presence of missions remained in several localities
throughout the remainder of the eighteenth century, resulting in the continuous presence of
Spaniards residing in these places (Collins 1995:386, Bolton 1939:17-18; 1962: 144, and Morfi
1935-I: 221-223).
In 1720, El Marques de Aguayo led the largest expedition yet to traverse Texas. It
transported through central Texas 500 men, 4,000 horses, 600 cattle, 900 sheep, almost 800
mules, and 600 loads of supplies. Their objective was to reactivate the moribund East Texas
missions. In following the advice of Tonkawan chief El Cuilon to avoid marshes and thickets
restricting El Camino Real passage (Hackett 1931:57-58), Aguayo bypassed the main highway
by traveling northeastward on branch roads across the Rio San Gabriel and along the uplands of
the vicinity of present-day I-35. He arrived on the west bank of the Rio Brazos near Waco. This
is the earliest clearly documented visit by Europeans to McLennan County. Crossing the Brazos,
Aguayo turned east toward the mission sites near Nacogdoches (Scarbrough 1973: 55-56).
These European settlements forever altered the life and culture of indigenous peoples for
hundreds of miles to the north. Those closest to McLennan County were three missions in
operation from 1746 to 1756 along the San Gabriel in western Milam County and Mission San
Saba near Menard from 1756 to 1766 (Bolton 1962:45,150-166,185, and Gilmore 1969:143).
The former was located fifty miles south of the county, the latter, about a hundred miles to the
southwest (Scarbrough 1973:64-70).
11

Throughout central Texas, changes involving indigenous peoples were taking place
throughout the eighteenth century. Representing the southern flank of the Wichita group, the
Tawakonis and Wacos moved southward into Texas from Oklahoma and Kansas between 1700
and 1719. The primary component of Wichita subsistence was garden horticulture. Fields of tall
maize, along with melons and beans, surrounded their villages. Once they acquired the horse,
they obtained meat from buffalo. Cultivated plant products remained their primary food source.
The Wichitas lived in a characteristic “grass house,” a substantial structure 15 to 30 feet in
diameter built over a circular framework of upright forked cedar posts covered with thatch. Each
house had two doors, facing east and west, with some having a third door facing south
(Newcomb 1999: 247-248,253-255). Several families lived in each building. Cooking occurred
at the fire located in the center of each structure. Although they owned horses, they walked most
of their long-distance treks (Poage 1981:14-15).
By 1772, the Wichita tribes had settled in villages located between present Waco, on the
Brazos, and present Palestine, on the Trinity (Hodge 1959). By 1779, the eastern settlements
along the Trinity were abandoned, causing many residents to move into established villages
along the Brazos (Newcomb 1999:250). The largest of these was the Tawakoni village of
Quiscat. Located on a bluff above springs on the west bank of the Brazos, it had about 750
residents and was named for a Tawakoni chief who in 1772 traveled to make peace with the
Spanish in San Antonio (Smyrl 1996a:431). Quiscat lasted until after 1795, the final recorded
reference to its activity (Hodge 1959). Quiscat is the earliest known long-term village in present
McLennan County. The earliest reference to the Waco Indians is when Juan Agustín Morfi
passed through Quiscat and noted a separate village of the Yscana, located eight leagues north.
Most scholars agree that the Yscana became the Wacos (Hodge 1959).
Between the 1750s and 1810, the Wichitas were prominent middlemen in trade between
the Comanches—by now dominating the plains of west Texas—and the French and their Indian
allies in Louisiana (Newcomb 1999:268). Before contact, the Comanches had been of the
southern groups of Eastern Shoshoni inhabiting upper reaches of the Platte River in eastern
Wyoming. After acquiring the horse, groups of Comanches separated from the Shoshoni and
moved south, crossing the Arkansas River and establishing themselves on margins of the Llano
Estacado, extending from western Oklahoma across the Texas Panhandle into eastern New
Mexico. This region became known as “Comancheria.” (Sultzman 1996 and Lipscomb 1996).
Although McLennan County lies to its east, Comanche raids significantly affected the county’s
earliest Anglo-American settlement from the late 1820s to the 1840s.
Late Historic (c.1800 – 1890s)
This final sub-period begins with the secularization of the missions around 1800. It
draws to a close with the relocation of all Texas aboriginal groups onto Federal reservations in
Oklahoma and New Mexico (Collins 1995:386), Comanches in the 1870s and Mescalero
Apaches in the 1880s.

The earliest recorded encampment on McLennan lands took place in 1801 by a band of
Anglo-Americans led by Philip Nolan. They camped in the vicinity of present-day Cameron
Park just west of the confluence of the Bosque and Brazos Rivers. A few days later, Spanish
soldiers killed Nolan and captured ten comrades (Poage 1981:25-26).
In 1821, Americans began settling Texas in significant numbers with the arrival of
Stephen F. Austin’s “Old Three-Hundred” to the south Texas Brazos banks in 1821. They
established their capital at San Felipe, on the west bank. In December 1824, Indian traders
Captain Henry and brother John Brown were robbed by Indians while encamped in present
McLennan County. Captain Brown escaped, but John ended up a captive of Waco Indians. John
Brown was held in a village on the east bank about two miles from Waco Village, which Captain
Brown attacked to recover his brother. Brown eventually escaped, arriving in San Felipe, where
he was forever after known as John “Waco” Brown (Brown 1909). Being one of the earliest
encounters with the Wacos, Anglo settlers were becoming aware of the formidable Wacos’
presence.
The Waco Indians developed their main village inland from the Brazos, just north of
present-day downtown Waco prior to 1820. It extended from Waco Spring, located just up the
west embankment of the Waco Suspension Bridge northward to Barron’s Branch and the present
Waco Drive. Waco Village had 500 to 600 residents by 1824 (Poage 1981:14-15). In 1829, the
Wacos drove back to their Red River villages a band of Cherokee at the original Waco High
School just west of Waco Village. A few months later the Cherokee overran the combined force
of the Tawakonis and Wacos in present Limestone County to occupy present-day East Waco and
ultimately lands to the west (Wilbarger 1985). Soon they forced most of the Wacos from their
Brazos village (Poage 1981:14-15).
Approaching 50 miles of the county, Robertson’s Colony was formed in 1825 with its
seat of government at Nashville on the west bank of the Brazos. This colony was to settle
several hundred families all the way up to “the northern edge of the Cross Timbers,” located
northwest of McLennan County (Poage 1981:29). This represents the first Anglo colony
formally encompassing a portion of what became McLennan County. To administer these
anticipated settlements, Mexican authorities established the District of Viesca, stretching into the
portion of McLennan County (Scarbrough 1973:71-76) lying east of the Brazos (Smyrl 1996a).
In 1834, the seat of government was moved from Nashville to Sarahville de Viesca, located on
the west bank just 15 miles south of the present McLennan line (Scarbrough 1973:71-76). Soon
thereafter, Marlin’s Fort and Bucksnort were also established along the Brazos (Poage 1981:3031).
The earliest homestead in McLennan County occurred along the Brazos north of these
settlements. In 1836, John Boyd moved 25 miles from Viasca to build a log home on the west
bank. Shortly thereafter, Boyd abandoned the cabin, probably because of a faulty land deed, as
this tract actually belonged to one Carlos O’Campo. Although it failed to endure, this is the first
13

recorded attempt by a European to permanently settle present McLennan County. The house
eventually was burned (Poage 1981:43, 82).
During early 1830s, two major surveying expeditions explored the McLennan County
area. On April 26, 1832, Mexico issued a land grant to Thomas Jefferson Chambers, the earliest
recorded land transaction for the county. Chambers hired Jacob de Cordova to conduct a survey
of two leagues of these lands, encompassing the Wacos’ village site and the present area of
downtown Waco. George B. Erath also surveyed lands in present McLennan County on his own
(Poage 1981:31, 80-82,197).
Being the vanguard of European settlement in central Texas, these surveyors attracted
vigilant resistance from Comanche and other Indians. In spring of 1836, the Comanche attacked
several settlements located just south of what became McLennan County. Killing and capturing
several family members, the Comanche drove the Neil McLennan homestead at McLennan’s
Bluff, on Pond Creek (Falls County) out of their lands (Longwell 1996:433) back to southcentral Texas. Comanche raiders burned Parker’s Fort, present Limestone County, captured
Cynthia Ann Parker, and drove the settlers away (Poage 1981:30, 46). Because of this
Comanche action, Salado (Scarbrough 1973:64-70) and other Little River valley settlements in
present-day Bell County also were abandoned (Bradle et al. 1997:9).
These Comanche incursions represented such a severe threat that not one family is
documented to have settled permanently in present-day McLennan County until 1844. Poage
explains that settlement was delayed until: “…the Indian menace could be controlled” (Poage
1981:30, 36-37).
In response to the Fort Parker destruction, Texas Republic Secretary of War William S.
Fisher authorized the construction of Fort Fisher in 1837. It was operated by Texas Rangers
under the command of Texas Ranger Captain Thomas Hudson Barron for only a few weeks
before being closed. It was deemed as being too remote to provide effective protection to
existing settlements to the south (Poage 1981:43).
To provide an atmosphere amenable for Indians and Texans to become acquainted and
establish peace treaties, Texas Republic President Sam Houston encouraged Torrey and Brothers
of Houston, which had operated Indian trading establishments since 1838, to build a trading
house north of the recognized settlements of Robertson’s Colony (Armbruster 1996). As
Torrey’s Trading House Number Two was being built on the highest promontory five miles east
of the confluence of Tehuacana Creek and the Brazos River, in southeast McLennan County, an
Indian camp ground four miles to the west (Smyrl 1996a) was developing into a popular meeting
grounds for the various tribes and Anglos to meet (Armbruster 1996 and Giles 1996).
Throughout 1843 and ’44, Houston’s representatives met with the Tawakoni, Waco, and other
eastern Texas tribes and, finally, also with the Comanches. The latter were persuaded to accept a
north-south demarcation line, west of which Anglo-American settlement would not extend into
14

Comancheria, and east of which Indians would no longer raid settlers. This treaty further
delayed Anglo-American settlement into Comanche territory and reduced Comanche threat in
areas east of that line being planned for settlement, such as the Brazos banks soon to be governed
by McLennan County (Poage 1981:18,37).
Representing the first civilian residential presence by Anglos in McLennan County, the
trading house was opened for business in early 1844. Located eight miles south of Waco
Village, the trading post by 1846 consisted of six or seven houses built of rough-hewn logs. The
largest buildings contained trade goods, with the remaining houses serving as living quarters
(Armbruster 1996). Open year-round, the post witnessed the sale and trade of large volumes of
guns, ammunition, and whiskey to Indians (Poage 1981:37, 44). In 1846 one Mr. Paul paid a fee
of $100 to build another building in the growing complex (Armbruster 1996). Thriving on
Indian trade, this community consisted of Rangers, trappers, surveyors, and drifters. Barnard
bought out the Torrey brothers with $9,500 in cash in 1848. This large amount reflected the
post’s prosperity over the past five years (Poage 1981:44). The next year, Barnard used the
inventory for starting a new trading house, Waco’s first retail store. He moved because Indians
no longer were patronizing his store on Tradinghouse Creek (Poage 1981:37, 44). Barnard is
identified as the county’s earliest settler (Smyrl 1996a).
The earliest farming family definitely to settle in the west side of the county was Neil
McLennan in 1845. Surveyor George B. Erath provided his former employee and friend 320
acres along the north bank of the South and Middle Bosque River on which he built a double log
dog-run house. In identifying the first settler on the east side of the Brazos, the process is far
from clear. In 1843, the Texas Republic granted Sarah Ann Walker a league and a labor of land
comprising most of present Lacy-Lakeview. Mrs. Walker built a log cabin on this tract soon
thereafter (actual date unknown). The Walker-Stanfield cemetery and Mrs. P. A. McKenzie’s
School developed around Mrs. Walker’s log house (Poage 1981: 46-47,242). This location is
less than two miles south of the project area.
Also within a few of miles of the project area lies another possible settlement dating to
the 1830s. Situated on the east bank four miles north of Waco Village, the white cliffs now
called Chalk Bluff were first explored by the brothers Lewis and Morris Moore in 1835, when
they were granted these lands from Mexico. The Moore brothers assisted in the development of
Fort Fisher in 1837, served in the Texas Army, and assisted George B. Erath in fighting Indians.
Part of Robertson’s Colony, this tract soon contained a cemetery, with earliest grave dated 1851.
When they actually built their original home remains unknown (Poage 1981:259).
In 1837, present East Waco received its earliest non-Indian settlers, Mary Ware and B. D.
Arnold. Having acquired 600 acres in the disputed “La Vega eleven league tract,” they built a
house, but little is known of how long they remained on this land (Hailey and Long 2000). If
this is a confirmed settlement, this Ware/Arnold homestead would be the earliest in McLennan
County.
15

In 1830, the Cherokees remained in the area for some time following their expulsion of
the Wacos from their villages just south of the Bosque-Brazos confluence (Wilbarger 1985 and
Conger 1996). Most Cherokee ended up as “squatters” along the east bank. During the 1840s,
the Cherokee may have controlled land as far north as the project area and seem to have played a
stabilizing role in this area. Soon, Anglo-American “squatters” joined the Cherokee, apparently
forming a mixed community. All avoided publicity; none were recorded as official residents.
The title deed records of the Tomas de La Vega eleven-league grant refer to these as
unauthorized settlers. Making up what became East Waco, this land had settlers prior to the
formation of Waco in 1850. In East Waco, the earliest settler officially to settle on his own land
was blacksmith Jesse Sutton, who built a residence and shop in 1846 near what became the Paul
Quinn College campus in East Waco (Poage 1981).
Involving the west bank, the first settler near present Waco was Thomas Barron in 1847.
Barron received 1,600 acres of land located just north of Waco Village, because he was a veteran
of the Texas Rangers (Poage 1981:45, 83). Anglo interest in Waco Village began in 1848.
Surveyor Thomas J. Chambers sold two leagues lying just south of the Barron tract and
encompassing the old Waco Indian village to John S. Sydnor. He subsequently divided the tract
with Galveston land agent Jacob De Cordova, who along with George B. Erath, had surveyed
much of this area. Erath urged De Cordova to survey the proposed town site at the former Indian
village. In 1848 the tract was sold. On March 1, 1849, Erath laid out the plat for the proposed
town, named “Lamartine” by De Cordova and his Galveston partners but changed to “Waco
Village” at Erath’s insistence (Conger 1996). The first settler to build a house in the new town
site of Waco was Shapley Ross. Next door, he established the first hotel and operated a ferry
service across the Brazos, all in 1849. The next year, he became the first postmaster of “Waco
Village, Texas” (Poage 1981:49-50).
The several hundred persons living in the area (exact population not distinguished from
“parent” counties in the 1850 census) worked with the Texas Legislature to carve out McLennan
County from the northern ends of Milam and Robertson Counties, accomplished on January 22,
1850 (Smyrl 1996a). For the next four years, the county was much larger than it is today, as it
encompassed territory to the north, in 1854 becoming Bosque County (Poage 1981:51).
In the first elections held on August 5th, 1850, three voting boxes were used, apparently
reflecting the three areas of settlement: White Rock, Erath (Bosqueville), and Waco Village.
Waco Village was one box. The only voting box east of the Brazos was “White Rock.” Located
some ten miles north of Waco (Poage 1981:51,179), this frontier hamlet was located a few miles
north of the project area. This indicates that a relatively solid population had established
permanent settlement in this area.
Located near the McLennan homestead, Erath built his house on farmland near the
McLennan farm some 15 miles west of Waco Village. Presumably the site of the “Erath Voting
Box,” Erath’s homestead formed the nucleus for an extended settlement encompassing the north
16

bank of the Bosque River and the west bank of the Brazos north of their confluence. The eastern
zone of this settlement area soon became known as “Bosqueville.” Being the earliest recorded
activity, “Burials [occurred]…as early as 1850 on ten acres given by Little Berry White for a
school and cemetery” (State of Texas 1965: Historical Marker), perhaps the county’s earliest
cemetery and dedicated school grounds. This means that Mr. White and those buried had been
living for several years of the 1840s along this ridge dividing the Brazos and North Bosque
drainages. Those “acres…for a school” became the campus of Bosqueville Male and Female
College, founded in 1854 by Presbyterian educator Dr. John Collier, the county’s earliest
institution of higher learning (Poage 1981:48, 81,129,142,245-247, and Smyrl 1996a). The
county’s original Masonic Lodge, “Bosque Lodge” was organized in 1852 and built a log edifice
which served as the first public school and Baptist church. In May 1850, an earlier Baptist group
began worshiping in Israel Speegle’s new home, which also served as a community center and
blacksmith shop (Poage 1981:53,248). Located about five miles west of Bosqueville, that
church seems to be the county’s earliest church but did not remain active past about 1860.
Of these settlements, Waco Village was selected as the county seat, largely because De
Cordova had donated free lots for public purposes, such as churches, schools, and the
courthouse. The latter came to fruition later that year (Conger 1996), until it was changed to the
“Waco Lodge Number 92,” the Bosque lodge was relocated to Waco in 1855 (Poage 1981:53).
In 1854 George Lambdin began publishing the Waco Era, the county’s first newspaper (Conger
1996). On August 20th, 1856, the City of Waco was incorporated (Poage 1981:198). During the
1850s, much lumber was hauled by freighter into McLennan County. Steadily growing into a
dominant crop, cotton was moved in large volumes from Central Texas to the Gulf coast. Public
stagecoaches provided passenger service in three directions: (1) Waco to Belton and Austin, San
Antonio and other points south; (2) Waco to Springfield, leading to Houston and to East Texas,
and (3) Waco to Bold Springs, leading to Dallas and other points north (Poage 1981:102,114).
Population had soared to 749 by 1859 (Conger 1996).
The earliest recorded religious service in McLennan County was conducted by Methodist
circuit-rider Reverend Joseph P. Sneed in the late 1840s. As 23 charter members organized into
a congregation, the Methodists built the county’s first church building, a crude plank sanctuary
(Smyrl 1996a), in late 1850, becoming the First Methodist Church of Waco (Poage 1981:129130), the city’s earliest church, and the earliest continuously active church in McLennan County.
The next year, the (First) Baptist Church of Waco was organized and held services with four
charter members in this Methodist meetinghouse. Noah T. Byars, formerly the blacksmith in
whose Washington-on-the-Brazos shop the Texas Declaration of Independence was signed,
served as pastor (First Baptist Church 2000). By 1854 the Presbyterians and Episcopalians held
services involving informally connected worshippers who organized First Presbyterian Church in
1855 and Saint Paul’s Episcopal Church some years later (Poage 1981:129-130 and Smyrl
1996a).

17

McLennan County’s first known school was conducted by Judge N. W. Battle in 1850.
Waco’s first lawyer, Battle taught the children of a few friends in a house near the Brazos River
in 1850. The earliest regular school in the county was a private academy taught by Professor N.
T. Sneed in 1851. In the 1850s and ‘60s, assorted small private and “pauper” public schools
served the needs of many Waco families (Poage 1981:143,145-146).
The Baptists and Methodists began organizing colleges in the mid 1850s. The earliest
school in Waco to teach secondary students was the Baptists’ Trinity Association River Male
High School (also called Waco High School) in 1855 (Poage 1981:149, and Smyrl 1996a). It
became “Waco Classical School” in 1860 (First Baptist Church 2000), when the newly formed
Waco Baptist Association assumed control over the school. It subsequently became “Waco
University” the next year when longtime Baylor University president Rufus C. Burleson and four
of his faculty abruptly resigned their positions at the Independence institution in June 1861
(Baker 1987:36). The Methodists began two secondary schools about 1856. By 1860, these had
been merged to form Waco Female College, a women’s school from primary to collegiate levels
(Standifer 1996).
Since the Texas government had discouraged settlement in this area prior to the
Comanche treaty at Torrey’s Tradinghouse in 1844, Indian raids did not wreak havoc on early
McLennan settlers that they did in neighboring counties. Within a few years of the first
pioneers, sufficient numbers of settlements existed west of Waco that the number of Indian raids
in the county had been reduced to the occasional stealing of a few horses. The rate of European
settlement, once commenced, was much greater than that for adjoining counties, leading to
McLennan County forging ahead of its neighbors to the south by 1860. Interestingly, George
Barnard—having relocated his store to Waco (Poage 1981:18,49-50,54-56)—a few years later
returned his the post to trade with Indians near Comanche Peak, in present Hood county
(Williams 1941), thereby departing the Waco area, no longer on the frontier.
The Tonkawa and Wichita tribes were declining in strength. Following the destruction of
Waco Village, they and other Wichita established short-lived villages throughout north Texas
(Elam 1996). Being signatories of the Tradinghouse Creek treaties, the Tawakoni and Wacos
enjoyed a few years of stability east of the river following 1844 (Hodge 1959). The Tonkawa
were deteriorating into a destitute culture, living off whatever food they could scavenge. Their
typical habitation had degenerated into a simple flat-topped hut, similar to a tepee in structure
but covered with brush branches and grass instead of buffalo skins. Newly arrived Anglos
traded for their pecans. By 1859, almost all Tonkawas were relocated to a reservation in Indian
Territory (Carlisle 1996:526), after first—along with Wacos and Tawakonis—they had been
forced onto the Brazos (also called “Lower”) Reservation near Graham, Texas, in 1854. The
Tawakoni ended up being placed on the reservation at Fort Belknap in 1856, being moved three
years later to the Wichita reservation in southern Oklahoma (Hodge 1959). In 1859, the
remaining 144 Wacos were moved to those Wichita lands near Anadarko (Poage 1981:14-16).
18

The population of Waco reached 2,000 in 1860 (Poage 1981:54). McLennan County
population soared to 6,206, of which 38.6 percent were slaves. There were 270 slaveholders
who owned large cotton plantations established in Brazos bottomlands. The surrounding prairie
on east and west banks was utilized primarily for livestock, including 46,600 cattle and 22,000
sheep (Smyrl 1996a). Situated in the midst of this plantation economy, Waco’s most prominent
citizens sympathized with the Southern cause (Conger 1996). At the January 1861 Secessionist
Convention, Waco representative Richard Coke voted in favor of Texas’ withdrawal from the
Union. This gesture ushered in secessionist control of McLennan County politics (Poage
1981:180), with voters overwhelmingly approving separation of Texas from the U.S. (Smyrl
1996a). Seventeen companies of Confederate soldiers—numbering about 1,500—were raised
from the Waco area (Conger 1996). No battle occurred in McLennan County, but Waco’s
Barron’s Mill (Smyrl 1996a) and the Earle Brothers Cotton Mill (Poage 1981:54-57) combined
to provide the majority of cotton cloth to the Confederacy (Smyrl 1996a).
The loss of the Civil War initially hit McLennan County hard, since such a large number
of slaves were freed from the plantations. The city of Waco's economy recovered more rapidly
than that of the countryside. In 1868 the town became a spur of the Chisholm Trail used by
cattlemen to drive steers to market in Kansas. They often stopped in Waco to buy supplies and
for recreation in the many saloons, gaming houses, and houses of prostitution (legally licensed
and regulated by the City until World War I, when finally it was outlawed) (Conger 1996). The
largest cattle ranch during the ‘60s and ‘70s was the eleven-league (48,000-acre) tract near China
Spring owned by the Conger brothers. Cattle became the largest single source of money for
rebuilding the Waco area economy for more than ten years following the Civil War (Poage
1981:67-69).
After 1880, cotton overtook cattle as the premier agricultural commodity. Since the
technological innovations with stronger plows, an increase in new cotton cultivation was taking
place in the blacklands of the river bottoms. Thousands of acres were shifted from cattle into
cotton production (Poage 1981:102,114).
The Depression of 1873 further crippled the large plantations, which no longer could be
adequately worked. Many eventually were sold for taxes and began to be acquired by a host of
newcomers to central Texas from across Europe. Germans settled in the Riesel and McGregor
areas. Czechs flowed into northeast McLennan County, settling first around St. Martinsville,
which became Tours, in recognition of the magnificent French city, highlighted by St. Martin’s
Catholic Church. This village has more of an old world feel than any other in the county (Poage
1981:49,115,257-262).
In 1870, Waco’s Roman Catholic community organized and built Church of St. Mary’s
of the Assumption, primarily to serve newly arrived German and Czech immigrants. Also
practiced by some of these immigrants, Jewish ceremonies were celebrated in rented rooms or
private homes prior to the establishment of Temple Rodef Shalom in 1871 (Smyrl 1996 and
19

Poage 1981:130-131). Protestants also prospered, as several new denominations became
established: Disciples of Christ (Christians) (some of whom became Church of Christ) organized
in 1870, African-American Baptists, and the African Methodist Episcopal Church a year later
(Poage 1981:130,135,151).
Waco's economy took off when two engineering feats were completed within a few months
of one another: the suspension bridge spanning the Brazos opened on January 7, 1870 (Smyrl
1996b), and arrival of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad (Waco Tap Railroad) in 1871. A fine
new station was built just east of the present Franklin Avenue bridge in 1872 to serve this, the
earliest railroad to serve McLennan County. This station still stands today. Spearheaded by New
York based Flint and Chamberlain Banking House and local civic leaders, the Waco Bridge
Company built the single-span Waco Suspension Bridge (Poage 1981:56,59-60,89,96), perhaps the
longest such span west of the East coast upon its completion.
A year later the Waco and Northwestern Railroad became the first rail line to cross the
Brazos into the city and western McLennan County. Its depot became an important debarkation
point for thousands of prospective settlers headed west and the primary shipping point for a
broad area (Conger 1996). These railroads and the Waco Suspension Bridge helped to raise land
prices, creating prosperity amid the national depression of 1873. Central Texas at last was an
integral part of the United States (Poage 1981:95).
The railroads brought huge changes to the rural sections of the county. In 1881, the Gulf,
Colorado, and Santa Fe built a line from Temple to Fort Worth. This line passed through the
western side of the county, because Waco already had several lines, and established the city of
Temple. In viewing this rail line from south to north, its completion effectively shifted the
populations of the older town of Perry (founded 1852) to Moody, those of Comanche Springs,
Banks, and Eagle Springs, Coryell County, to McGregor, and those of Tonk Crossing and “old”
Crawford to “new” Crawford (Poage 1981:52, 92,250-254).
In January 1882, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas (“Katy”) Railroad became the first line to
provide “mainline” passenger service to Dallas and Fort Worth, and a couple of years later, to
Austin and San Antonio (Smyrl 1996a). With home offices in Dallas, the Katy seems to have
assumed a “home” nature for central Texans. Wacoans rode Katy trains much more than any
other passenger line. In viewing this rail line from south to north, its completion effectively
shifted population from Mastersville to Bruceville and Eddy, from Ritchie, Stanford Chapel, and
South Bosque to Hewitt, from White Rock, Union Grove, and Geneva to Elm Mott, and from
Bold Springs, where McLennan County’s earliest recorded post office was established in 1852,
White Oak, Tokio, and Tours, all into to West (Poage 1981:49, 52,243-253,257-258,262-264).
Smaller new rail lines made Waco their principal junction. The Texas and St. Louis
connected Waco with Corsicana in 1881 and with Gatesville in 1882, creating the towns of
Leroy and Axtell to the east. To the west, this line, also called the Cotton Belt, crossed the Santa
20

Fe at McGregor, strengthening that city and the older town of South Bosque. To the south, the
San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railroad laid track from Waco south to Downsville and into Falls
County in 1889 (Smyrl 1996). To the northwest, in 1889 the Texas Central connected Ross with
Albany, Texas, with a rival line to Ross (Poage 1981:261-262) becoming the second track to
pass across the project area. Waco's population grew from 3,008 in 1870 to 7,295 by 1880
(Smyrl 1996). At the maximum, there were 29 passenger trains per day stopping in Waco.
Several of these offered sleeper cars which would end up in Houston, Austin, San Antonio, or
various points to the north (Poage 1981:98-99).
The only McLennan town to have developed without a railroad was China Spring in the
north-central area of the county. First known in the 1870s, it was the result of population shift
from nearby west bank settlements of Patrick, Rock Creek, and Stark Grove (Poage 1981:50-51,
83-84,245-247). By 1870, several rural communities were maintaining public schools for four to
six months per year. With widespread public opposition, Waco experienced only sporadic
attempts at free schools during the ‘70s but saw widespread public education take off the next
decade (Poage 1981:143). Mostly church-related, private higher education kept developing in
Waco. In 1877 the African Methodist Episcopal church relocated Paul Quinn College from
Austin to Waco (Hales 1996). In 1873, Sacred Heart Academy was established at St. Mary’s
Catholic Church, later with its own campus (Poage 1981:146,149-150). Smaller schools serving
central Texas’ secondary and collegiate needs were: Waco Academy, Waco Select School, and
Leland Seminary (Smyrl 1996).
The greatest collegiate developments involved the two original Methodist and Baptist
schools. Continuing without a break through the war and Reconstruction, both flourished in the
1870s and ‘80s. Waco Female College moved to a new 13½-acre campus on the north edge of
town but suffered economic destruction from the panic of 1893, ultimately closing in 1893
(Standifer 1996). Recently relocated from Thorpe Springs, Add-Ran College, a Disciples of
Christ institution, took over this north side campus in 1895. Relocated from Independence in
1886, Baylor University was consolidated with Waco University, with the new “Baylor
University at Waco” opening up a brand new campus on the south side of town the next year,
becoming the Baptists’ preeminent institution in Texas and the South. Waco became known as
the “Athens of Texas” (Smyrl 1996).
Modern Era (1890s-present)
Representing the last new rail line, the International and Great Northern (I. & G.N.) was
built through Marlin, Riesel, and Mart to Waco in 1902. The next year, it was completed to Fort
Worth. The line located its shops in Mart, which experienced many years of prosperity until
their closure in the 1960s (Poage 1981:94-95). In viewing this line from south to north, this
completion effectively shifted population from Willow Springs to Mart and from Roddy, Meiers’
Settlement, and Prospect to Riesel (Poage 1981:254-257).
21

By 1890 streetcars pulled by mules ran regular city routes but the Waco Railway and
Electric Light Company were replacing them with electric cars starting the next year. By 1900
there were 20,686 people living in the city, making it the sixth largest population center in
Texas. In 1909 the elaborate Cotton Palace was built, with its associated Fall Exposition
becoming one of the South’s most popular fairs. Waco also was becoming an important center
of the state's insurance industry. The Amicable Insurance Building, a twenty-two-story structure
completed in 1911, was deliberately designed to be the tallest building in Texas at the time, and
remains to this day the only skyscraper between Dallas and Austin. An electric interurban
railway opened in 1913, connecting the city with Dallas, lasting until improved highways put it
out of business. Using one of the two nineteenth century tracks, it also crossed the project area.
By 1914 Waco had grown to about 35,000 residents (Conger 1996).
The onset of World War I brought Army Camp MacArthur and Rich Field to Waco in
1917. This stimulated urban growth (Smyrl 1996a). Camp MacArthur became an infantry
training base covering more than 10,000 acres of what became the northwestern part of the city.
The 35,000 troops assigned to the camp between 1917 and 1919 almost doubled Waco's
population (Conger 1996). Because many soldiers remained in Waco to raise their families,
expansion continued in the post-war economy. Although agriculture continued to dominate,
industry was becoming an integral component of the McLennan County economy. Atlas
Portland Cement Company opened in the limestone-rich hills southwest of Waco in 1929. In the
1920s the Missouri, Kansas and Texas (Katy) Railroad chose a site east of Waco for its
locomotive shops. Several hundred people were employed at the shops, and families began
moving to this area called Bellmead, which became Waco’s first suburb. Area schools were
consolidated to form the La Vega Independent School District in 1927 (Smyrl 1996c and Poage
1981:92). By 1930 Waco had reached 53,848 inhabitants (Conger 1996).
The Great Depression undercut the county and city's prosperity. Severe drought
compounded the crisis. As prices for agricultural products fell and farmers reduced their
spending, businesses in Waco were forced to lay off employees and to close their doors, in many
instances. The Cotton Palace fair had enjoyed a twenty-one year attendance of more than eight
million (Smyrl 1996a), but this symbol of the city's prosperity was shut down in 1930 due to
these effects. Federal construction programs helped to create employment opportunities,
resulting in University High School in south Waco and Tonkawa Park in Crawford. In 1940, the
city’s population had hardly changed, 55,982 people (Conger 1996), with the county growing
just three percent (Smyrl 1996a).
From 1900 to after 1920, rural African Americans, attracted by improved schools and
better paying jobs, flocked to Waco. With most settling in black neighborhoods, an educated
black middle class began emerging during these years. In partial response to this perceived
threat to established white society, the Ku Klux Klan lynched blacks in 1905, 1915, and 1916.
During the 1920s mobs of white citizens hanged or burned blacks on several occasions. Klan
activity peaked in 1923 with a parade of 2,000 Klansmen marching through the city and
22

boycotting businesses unsympathetic with the Klan agenda (Conger 1996). Because of its
violence, the Klan gradually lost power (Smyrl 1996a).
Other ethnic groups also increased in McLennan County. Mexican nationals found work
during the first three decades of the twentieth century, increasing from 100 in 1900 to more than
4,100 in 1930, or 4 percent of the total population of McLennan County (Smyrl 1996a). The
West area remained distinctively Czech, as Nemecek Brothers opened a meat market in 1898
(still active in 2001, and the Hospadzr (later Czechoslovak Publishing Company) newspaper
remains America’s largest distribution Czech periodical. Other businesses to be developed since
the 1920 are: Sulak’s Restaurant, the Old Corner Drug Store (Poage 1981:258), and the Village
Bakery.
The needs of World War II increased demand for cotton products. This increased production
invigorating Waco's economy (Conger 1996). Military bases in or around the city included:
Blackland Army Air Field, Waco Army Flying School, and Waco Army Airfield (later renamed
James Connally Air Force Base) on the east side. The latter installation was located within 3
miles of the project area. Bluebonnet ordnance plant was an Army-operated weapons plant
southwest of McGregor (Smyrl 1996a and Poage 1981:240,252). These new bases and plants
opened new jobs for local residents. The huge influx of workers and military families working
and serving in Waco caused housing shortages (Conger 1996).
Waco was devastated by a tornado in 1953. Over a hundred people were killed on that
May afternoon. Slow to recover, the city’s businesses developed shopping centers and malls on
the edge of Waco. Many residents moved to the suburbs of Bellmead (Smyrl 1996c), LacyLakeview, and Beverly Hills (Poage 1981).
Add-Ran College changed its name to Texas Christian University (TCU) in 1902 (Smyrl
1996a). After the main building burned on March 23, 1910, the trustees agreed that TCU should
leave Waco for Fort Worth (Wallace 1998). Waco no longer had two major universities. Baylor
University gradually developed into an internationally renowned institution. Most of Waco’s
smaller colleges closed or moved away, as well. Sacred Heart Academy persisted until 1946,
when it was closed (Henry 1996). In 1902, black Baptists opened Central Texas College to
provide primary to collegiate levels of instruction for African Americans but closed 29 years
later due to financial difficulties brought on by the Depression (Kelley 1972). Paul Quinn
College was relocated to Dallas in 1990 (Hales 1996). Two new colleges have arisen to meet the
needs of lower division students: McLennan Community College (started in 1965) and Texas
State Technical Institute (opened in 1966 on the abandoned James Connally Air Force Base
property (Poage 1981:240), situated near the project area. These two-year colleges provide
lower division and vocational-technical training for thousands of students.
Several McLennan County residents have changed the nation and the world. Waco was
home to Doris Miller, a black sailor who heroically fought at Pearl Harbor but was tragically
23

killed in action later in World War II. A century earlier, Waco pioneer Richard Coke was
elected Governor in 1873, under whose administration Reconstruction was brought to a close,
and later served as U.S. Senator. Six Wacoans served the Confederate Army as Generals:
Lawrence Sullivan Ross, Hiram Granbury, Allison Nelson, James Harrison, Thomas Harrison,
and Richard Harrison (the last three being brothers). Son of Waco pioneer Shapley Ross, Sul
Ross later became Texas governor and president of Texas A&M. Born near Hewitt, Tom
Connally grew up just across the Falls County line near Eddy to become the area’s Member of
Congress and later Texas’ United States Senator for the first two decades of the twentieth
century. Born near South Bosque, W. R. (Bob) Poage served longer than anyone else as U. S.
Congressman from central Texas (Poage 1981:57-60,250,263-264). Located three miles south of
the project area, Lakeview was the birthplace of Ann Richards, Texas governor from 1990 to
1994. From Moody came world renowned pianist Van Cliburn, who has been delighting
classical music audiences worldwide for more than 50 years. In early 1993, David Koresh led
Branch Davidians to barracade themselves in their compound located near Elk, eight miles east
of Waco. On April 19, a fire consumed the compound, killing more than 70, including Koresh,
following two months of attempts by FBI and ATF agents to apprehend the sect for suspicion of
Federal firearm violations. These events brought nationwide attention to Waco (Wallace 1998).
In 1999, Texas Governor George W. Bush purchased the Prairie Chapel Ranch five miles
northwest of Crawford. Following his 2000 election to the White House, President George W.
Bush and his family have been making Crawford their vacation White House. In November
2001, this McLennan County property and the Crawford High School played host for meetings
between President Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin. These discussions have resulted
in important advances in U.S.-Russian relations. With this international media attention,
“Crawford, Texas” is a household word throughout the world.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
According to Prehistoric Archeological Sites in Texas: A Statistical Overview (Biesaart et al.
1985:166), there were 85 sites recorded in McLennan County at TARL when this study was
published by the Office of the State Archeologist in 1985. Since 1985, however, the number of
recorded sites has greatly increased. Although sites have been recorded by private contract
archaeology firms, local archaeological societies, and individuals.
The efforts of members of the Central Texas Archaeological Society have made notable
contributions. These include articles in the form of bulletins, newsletters, special reports, and
unpublished manuscripts on file at TARL or with society members. McLennan County has been the
subject of intensive investigations by members of the Central Texas Archeological Society.
In the site files at TARL are numerous pieces of correspondence from landowners and
artifact collectors documenting and describing sites and artifacts found in McLennan County. Also
present are copies of unpublished manuscripts, some of which do not provide information
concerning author and date of preparation.
McLennan County contains numerous prehistoric and historic sites, many potentially eligible
for the National Register of Historic Places or as State Archeological Landmarks. However, certain
sections of the county have not been adequately investigated. The current project area falls within
this category. There is reason to believe that a large number of unrecorded sites exist along the
major streams of this area in the form of surface sites, possible rockshelter sites, and buried sites.
No previous archaeological work has taken place in the current project area. The records at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, University of Texas at Austin were consulted prior to
entering the filed to ascertain whether or not previous work had been conducted within our project
area and if any known sites were in the records. The only activity in the vicinity was the recording of
site 41ML238 by Calvin B. Smith in 1995 denoting one of the localities for dumping historic debris
and rubble from the 1953 tornado that struck the City of Waco.

25

FIELD METHODS
Background Research
Before entering the field, a background investigation was conducted. Site records at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas were checked for previously
recorded sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, site reports documenting work in the
region were examined for information concerning archaeological surveys and other work relevant to
the project area. The project was discussed with representatives of the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame
and Museum to ensure that the field crew was aware of the correct property boundaries. Archival
research revealed that the area below the cemetery was located in a recorded cemetery area knows as
the First Street Cemetery in a 5 acre tract recorded in Volume B Page 275 of the McLennan County
Deed Records. The other portion below the terrace was also recorded as a cemetery in Volume 40
Page 384 of the McLennan County Deed Records.
Field Survey
The fieldwork was accomplished using the pedestrian survey method supported by backhoe
trenching and scraping with a grader (Appendix I). Surface visibility was excellent over much of the
project area, especially the northern half. Two backhoe trenches were excavated in order to define
the stratigraphy and provide a basis for stripping soils down in search of any unknown burials that
might be present (Figure 2). Four profiles were described along both trenches (Appendix II). A
grader was brought in and systematic stripping in 10 centimeter levels was conducted for several
days in an attempt to locate unmarked burials that might be present.

26

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
The site records at TARL revealed no sites had been recorded in the project area. Various
projects conducted at Lake Waco have recorded the vast majority of sites in the county (see Culture
Sequence and Previous Investigations above).
Field Survey
The field survey identified no prehistoric sites and one historic site (41ML238) within the
project area. Even though parts of the project area were probably utilized in some way during
prehistoric, no specific evidence that would constitute a site was found. Overall, the area is very
disturbed and the presence of road base and cross-bedding clearing indicates a mixture of soils.
Additional operations included removing the asphalt road using a Cat backhoe and the road base
was exposed. A Gradeall began excavating trench 1 (Appendix II) beginning at SW corner of
building 2 foot print and opening hole to the east along the inside edge of the proposed location.
This smooth blade excavator quickly cleared a clean hole to about 110 centimeters deep
exposing 4 stratigraphic zones.

Figure 4. View east of the Gradeall skimming in the project area.
The Gradeall finished Backhoe Trench (BHT) 1 that was placed along the southwest border
of the project area and BHT-2 (Appendix II) was excavated along the northeast boundary. BHT-2
discovered the presence of a brick-lined grave or brick foundation running N19E that had been
penetrated by a PVC water line and a grey plastic electrical cable. Unfortunately, most of the
south part of the foundation was removed by the Gradeall before we realized it might be part of
28

an older structure. At this point, we abandoned using the Gradeall in favor of a three-yard frontend loader and a motor grader. This brick feature was designated as Feature 1 or crypt 1, a
foundation sheared of sometime in the past but once used as a burial vault pre-1900s. Our
investigation revealed it is roughly square with the east foundation running 19 degrees magnetic.
A shallow builder’s trench was excavated and then three parallel rows of brick placed into the
ditch and mortared together using limy cement with the following inside dimensions:

4.70 meters

5.13 meters

The bricks are standard 8 ½ by 4 by 2 ½ inches with no markings. The mortar is soft and
fine with no facing mud or plaster on the inside or out. The corners are reinforced by an extra
brick on the outside of the angle either as added support for the vault or as faux quoins. The
three-brick wide foundation is uniformly 30-centimeres wide. The vault or sepulcher was
evidently removed to the ground surface after the graves were moved to the upper terrace.
Inside the foundation was found a concrete block of slab measuring 90 (east/west) by 66
centimeters (north/south). The NE slab corner was 3.62 centimeters from the NE corner of the
foundation and 3.13 centimeters from the SE corner of the foundation and the east edge of the
slab was 2.25 centimeters from the east wall (inside). It was over 15 centimeters thick and
consisted of poured slurry with broken limestone fragments used as filler.
No burial pits or grave outlines were noted in the cleaned areas. The area south of the
buried cable was partially stripped of the 1900s Waco trash and mixed soils but because of a
greater depth, more work was needed. We continued stripping the northern portion with the
motor grader and removing the trash fill from the southern part using the skip loader or front-end
loader in 10 centimeter levels. A second crypt was noted in the NW portion of the building 2 foot
print as the motor grader continued to remove overburden. This appeared as a narrow
16centimeter wide wall or foundation of poured concrete without reinforcing bar or wire forming
a square on a bearing of 345 degrees magnetic. This crypt was recorded as feature 2 or crypt 2
and noted the following measurements: All sides 4.30 meters, inside corner to inside corner. The
center of the feature is at 14UTM 678673/3492457, NAD 27, +/- 5m and the angle from the
center to the NE corner is 200 magnetic. Construction material is a dense concrete consisting of
fairly uniform gravel. Form marks and toweling on the top indicate the material was poured in
place rather than placed as independent blocks.
An unmarked limestone block measuring about 14 x 6 x 2 inches was found 60
centimeters east of the east wall and may have been a foot stone for one of the removed graves.
We continued scraping did not reveal other stone or any indication of burials inside the
enclosure. It was noted that the outside fill was continuous 1900s trash while the inside fill,
although disturbed to some degree, did not contain historic trash.
During our scraping operations, the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum personnel
provided AAG with a blueline drawing they had just procured from the City of Waco Attorney
that purported to show a burial relocation project from 1968. The map showed numbered graves
that corresponded to a published list of recorded gravestones and a series of x marks where
unmarked graves had been moved. Of importance was a note in the publication saying that no
prospecting was accomplished to locate unmarked graves. Given the presence of graves and an
obvious extension of the First Street Cemetery, albeit scant, these scraping operations were
valuable in additional preservation efforts to try and locate unmarked burials that might be
present. After the entire 8,000 square foot area had been scraped, no burials were located and it
appears that the City of Waco did indeed disinter the previous burials located in the project area.
30

Archival research revealed that two people were in fact present in the area recorded as
Feature 1 but were ultimately moved. They were Jessie Wiggins (1885-1901) and Eveline
Wiggins (1887). Additional archival research also revealed that the Central Texas Genealogical
Society had conducted an early study and recorded data for many of the graves and the
tombstone data. Page 98 of Volume I of the McLennan County, Texas Cemetery Records (1965)
revealed that Eveline Wiggins died on May 12, 1887 at age 85. Jessie Wiggins, daughter of J.W.
& Emma Wiggins, was born on October 7, 1885 and died on April 29, 1901, at age 15.
The archival research also revealed that two people had been buried inside of Feature 2,
and one unknown burial immediately east of Feature 2. The two burials inside Feature 2 were
Laura Hider (1919) and W. S. Norwood. No remains were found and it appears that all three of
these graves had also been disinterred in 1968. Pages 91-92 of Volume I of the McLennan
County, Texas Cemetery Records (1965) revealed that W. S. Norwood died on May 21, 1914 at
age 44 and Mrs. Laura Hider died on June 11, 1919 at age 65.
Each of these 5 burials had been disinterred as a result of City of Waco Ordinance No.
2507 (Appendix III). It granted the authority for all graves in this area to be disinterred and
reburied elsewhere in the same cemetery for proper care.

31

RECOMMENDATIONS
The current survey of the 8,000 square foot area for the proposed expansion of the Texas
Ranger Museum in McLennan County, Texas performed for the City of Waco did not identify any
historic graves in the project area. One previously recorded historic site was found to extend into the
project area. 41ML238 is a late nineteenth-early twentieth century dump site that has been heavily
impacted and consisted of mixed soils and historic trash as well as an extension of the area where
historic debris was dumped from the 1953 tornado that hit the City of Waco. Site 41ML238 was also
extended to include the First Street Cemetery. This portion of 41ML238 is not considered eligible
for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or worthy of designation as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) because it contains no significant architectural features, no intact
cultural deposits, no significant artifact assemblages and has been severely impacted and mixed
soils. It is recommended that the City of Waco be allowed to proceed with the current proposed
project and archaeological monitoring is not necessary.

APPENDIX I
RESEARCH DESIGN
Records Check
Prior to entering the field, American Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G.) will contact the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, the state repository for site
records on Texas, to determine if previously recorded sites are present in the project area. This
task may be conducted by a personal visit to TARL or by telephone.
The library at A.A.G. is very extensive, especially regarding reports for the project area
region, and much of the archival work can be accomplished in-house. Since A.A.G. has
conducted work in the area, much of the background work has already been accomplished.
Permit Application
No fieldwork will commence until a permit from the Archeology Division (AD) of the
Texas Historical Commission has been issued. An application for an antiquities permit will be
submitted to AD-THC as soon as AAG receives notice to proceed. Normally, AAG discusses the
project with AD personnel before beginning any fieldwork. This is done to ensure that both
parties are in agreement as to the level of work required for this project.
Survey Methods
The entire project area will be 100% intensively surveyed utilizing the pedestrian survey
method supported by shovel testing and/or augering and examination of eroded and disturbed
areas where cultural materials may be visible on the surface. Backhoe trenching may be used to
examine deep soils to determine if cultural deposits are deeply buried. Michael R. Bradle will act
as the Principal Investigator. Shovel testing, augering, and backhoe trenching will meet and
exceed the minimum survey standards for Texas established by the THC. The entire 8,000
square foot area will be scraped using machinery to expose the outlines of any potential graves
from the adjacent cemetery.
In areas of poor visibility, and environmental settings that have potential for buried
cultural materials, shovel testing will be required and tests will be concentrated in areas of high
site probability and randomly across the project area. All excavated fill will be screened through
1/4-inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests will be manually excavated to sterile clay or bedrock when
possible.
The survey crew will be equipped with shovel test forms, notebooks, camera, compass,
and a project area map for accurate plotting of shovel tests, backhoe trenches, and archaeological
sites. In addition to shovel testing as a means of identifying buried sites, select areas in alluvial
43

settings or areas with some appreciable soil depth will be subjected to backhoe trenching. All
sites identified in the project area will be mapped in the field and plotted on a topographic map.
Site locations will also be determined through the use of a global positioning system (GPS).
Each site will be recorded using the official State of Texas archeological site form. In no case
will the survey crew work outside of the project area as depicted on the project area map
provided by the client.
Only diagnostic artifacts will be collected from the surface. All artifacts recovered
through shovel testing will be collected. These specimens will be bagged and recorded on a field
sack log. They will be analyzed and prepared for eventual curation at TARL, unless a petition to
discard is prepared and accepted.
The draft report will be submitted to ad-THC for review. Once the report has been
approved by the AD-THC, copies will be delivered to AD-THC and the client. AAG will
maintain copies of the notes, photographs, site forms, and any other records produced from the
project deemed to be a work product.
Scope of Work
I.

Conduct background check for previously recorded archaeological sites in the project
area and the vicinity. Review the relevant literature.

II.

Discuss the project with the AD-THC reviewer assigned to this project before entering
the field.

III.

Obtain an antiquities permit from AD-THC.

IV.

Consult with the representative of the sponsor before beginning the field survey.

V.

Perform a 100% pedestrian survey of the project area to include shovel testing, and
examination of all exposed areas such as creek banks for buried or displaced artifacts.

VI.

Check for deeply buried sites through the use of backhoe trenching in areas with deep
soils and scrape the entire area to search for potential burials. Remove burials and rebury
in adjacent cemetery.

VII.

Analyze all artifacts recovered and prepare them for curation at TARL.

VIII.

Prepare a draft report and submit copies to the AD-THC and the sponsor for review.

IX.

Make all required changes, correct any mistakes, and submit the final report and turn in
the artifacts for curation.
