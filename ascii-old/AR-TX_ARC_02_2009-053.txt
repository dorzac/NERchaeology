ABSTRACT

The Trinity River Authority intends to construct approximately 8,800 feet
of pipeline for the Red Oak Creek Relief Interceptor (RO-1) in Ellis
County, Texas. The pipeline route runs through the Red Oak Creek
floodplain and travels east approximately 2,000 feet west of the IH-35E
and Stephenson Road intersection, and proceeds upstream generally
following Red Oak Creek. The route terminates about 1,000 feet south of
the Locust and Elm Drives intersection. AR Consultants, Inc. conducted
the archaeological survey for Schrickel, Rollins and Associates, Inc.,
which is managing the environmental permitting for the Trinity River
Authority of Texas. During the survey, AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC)
excavated 29 shovel tests, six backhoe trenches and conducted creek bank
profiles on Red Oak and Little creeks. Despite the buried prehistoric sites
recorded during previous investigations in the general vicinity, no cultural
resources were recorded during these investigations. Therefore, ARC
recommends that construction should be allowed to proceed with the
pipeline route. However, during construction if cultural deposits are
uncovered work should cease immediately and the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission and the US Army Corps of Engineers
should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
The Trinity River Authority (TRA), which owns the Red Oak Creek Regional
Wastewater System, intends to construct approximately 8,800 feet of pipeline for the Red
Oak Creek Interceptor (Segment RO-1). The proposed pipeline route will begin
approximately 2,000 feet west of the IH-35E, proceed upstream generally following Red
Oak Creek, and terminate about 1,000 feet south of the Locust and Elm Drives
intersection (Figure 1). The pipeline will be installed via open trench, except for the creek
crossings and anywhere a large tree cannot be avoided, they will be bored.
AR Consultants, Inc. was retained to conduct an intensive pedestrian archaeological
survey of the pipeline route by Schrickel, Rollins and Associates, Inc., which is managing
the environmental permitting for the TRA. The purpose of the archaeological survey was
to determine if cultural materials older than 50 years are present, and, if so, make
recommendations about their significance and how they will be impacted by construction.
The cultural resource investigation was conducted during July and November of 2009
and was required because the TRA is a political entity of the State of Texas. Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 5265 was issued for the survey. Since Red Oak Creek
contains Waters of the United States, they fall within the jurisdiction of the Fort Worth
District of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Relevant federal legislation includes the
National Historic Preservation Policy Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National
Environmental Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation
Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), the Clean Water Act, as amended PL92500 and
the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission not only will review this report as the State Agency, but also as the Section
106 review agency.
This report was written in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission, and developed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the natural
setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the cultural history of North
Central Texas. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed in the
investigation is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report
concludes with recommendations followed by the references cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The route for the proposed Red Oak Creek Relief Interceptor, Segment RO-1, is located
in north central Ellis County. The Austin Chalk Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology
1988), which contains layered chalk and marl beds, underlies the survey area. Two
drainages, Little Creek to the north and Red Oak Creek to the south, are bisected by the
eastern end of the route. The Geological Atlas of Texas Dallas Sheet shows the sections
of Little Creek and Red Oak Creek within the study area contains Holocene Alluvium
deposits containing gravels, sand, silt and clay. Thin, discontinuous Uvalde gravel
deposits are located on stream divides from Dallas and Tarrant County and continue
south into northern Mexico (Byrd 1971). Gravel deposits have been mapped within the
Red Oak Creek Watershed, and throughout Ellis County; the presence of these gravels is
relevant to cultural resource investigations, as they provided the Native Americans with
local material for the manufacture of chipped stone tools (Yedlowski, Shaunessy, Jurney
and Adovasio 1998). The soils that overlie the Austin Chalk bedrock are upland silty
clays in the Austin series, calcareous silty clays and loams on the slopes along the
streams in the Lewisville series and Frio silty clays within the floodplains of the
drainages (Brooks, Rogers, Mayberry, McSpadden, Mitchell and Huntsinger 1964: Sheet
3).
Red Oak Creek and Little Creek are two drainages within the larger Trinity River Basin,
which drain surface water from the uplands of the Blackland Prairie downstream to the
east (Kuchler 1964: Region No. 68). Ellis County falls within what Kuchler classifies as
prairie dominated by Andropogon-Sipa grasses. Various other grasses are present as well.
Herbaceous plants thrive in the thin soils overlying Austin Chalk, while oak and cedar
elm trees are found along drainage channels (Diggs, Lipscomb and O’Kennon 1999:40).
Mesquites are present today but this is due to recent invasion of this species into the
Blackland.
The sections of Little Creek and Red Oak Creek within the study area are mapped as
being perennial on the USGS map but are mapped as intermittent on the Soils Map for
Ellis County (Brooks et al. 1964) and on the Geological Atlas of Texas Dallas Sheet
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1988). Northwest of where the two creeks split, a
limestone gravel pit is mapped at the confluence of the steams.

CULTURE HISTORY
The culture history of the Upper and Middle Trinity River Basin from the prehistoric to
present day is summarized by period below. This summary is drawn from the extensive
investigations at Richland Chambers Lake [Richland Archaeological Project] (Raab
1982; McGregor and Bruseth 1987; Moir and Jurney 1987), the synthesis of north-central
Texas prehistory by Prikryl (1990) and from the studies conducted for the proposed
Superconducting Super Collider project in Ellis County (Yedlowski et al. 1998).
Paleoindian (11,000-7,000 BC)
Evidence for early human occupation in the region is found in a series of diagnostic
projectile point types including Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff, Plainview, Meserve and San
Patrice. The majority of these projectile points have been recorded on the surface or were
mixed with artifacts from later periods. Population density was low during this period and
groups were highly mobile hunter-gatherers who exploited a broad region for plant and
animal resources (Yedlowski et al. 1998:45). A cache of Clovis blades was found on the
north edge of Richland/Chambers Lake (Young and Collins 1989) when it was exposed
by lake erosion. Removal of the overburden discovered several blades in place, yet this
type of find is extremely rare in the archaeological record.
Archaic (7,000 B.C. – A.D. 800)
This period is typically subdivided in the Early, Middle and Late; each stage is
recognized in the archaeological record by changes in technology such as stylistic
variances of dart points and the presence of ground stone tools. Sites in this region are
usually found on the first terrace of major drainages and at their confluence with a
smaller tributary. Features identified at Early Archaic sites include midden deposits that
have chipped stone tools made from exotic cherts, while at Late Archaic sites, local chert
and quartzite found in Uvalde gravel deposits were commonly used for tool making. Site
densities, and most likely population, increase from the Early to the Late Archaic. This
increase in site density has been attributed with climate changes occurring during the
Late Archaic.
Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800-1,600)
Technological changes continued throughout the Late Prehistoric and lithic tools
attributed to Late Prehistoric I include Alba, Scallorn, Steiner and Catahoula arrow
points. Evidence for more sedentary behavior is seen in the remains of houses and
agricultural activities from this period. Along with the increased sedentism, ceramics
appear in the Trinity River drainage, although studies at Richland/Chambers tentatively
suggest ceramics appear during the Terminal Archaic (Yedlowski et al. 1998:53). During
the Late Prehistoric II period, chipped stone tools continue to have been manufactured
from local lithic material and diagnostic types include Fresno, Harrell, Perdiz and
Washita (Prikryl 1990:60-61).

Euroamerican Contact (A.D. 1,600-1820)
Historic Native American sites attributed to this transitional period between the
prehistoric and the historic are virtually unknown throughout North Central Texas. Yet
archival research indicates that native groups such as the Wichtas, the Tonkasas, the
Wacos and the Caddos traded with Spanish settlements in north central Texas. Therefore,
sites from this period may contain cultural material of indigenous manufacture and
European trade goods (Yedlowski et al. 1998:61).
American Era (A.D. 1820-Present)
This era has been divided into four periods by Richner and Lee (1977:48-50). The four
periods are frontier (ca 1820-1840), initial cash crop (ca 1840-1870), tenant farming (ca
1870-1940), and agribusiness (ca 1940-present). By the end of the frontier period, Native
American populations had disappeared from the region. The second period was divided
by the Civil War, but was characterized by the growth of cotton as a cash crop and the
use of the rivers for transportation. Tenant farming replaced the plantation system after
the Civil War and railroads replaced river navigation as the means of moving cotton to
the market place. Lumbering and oil production were added to the economic base during
this period. The last period (Agribusiness) is marked by the consolidation of farms and
the use of mechanized equipment to plant and harvest crops that had been done in the
past by the once large labor pool. Since the beginning of this period, crop production has
been replaced with livestock production and cotton has been replaced by pasturage.
Previous Investigations
Several linear studies have been conducted within 5 miles of the project area for the
Texas Water Development Board (Fox, Jurgens, Davis, Henderson and Whitsett 1998),
the SDHPT (1979), Trinity River Authority (Todd 2007) and for the Superconducting
Super Collider project (Yedlowski et al. 1998). During these investigations, multiple
historic and prehistoric archaeological sites have been recorded. Prehistoric sites range
from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric in age and sites types include ephemeral
evidence for occupation in the form of isolated finds, lithic scatters, campsites and the
occasional burial. Historic sites in the region include 19th and 20th century farmsteads,
homesteads and cemeteries. These investigations demonstrate that Ellis County,
specifically the area surrounding the town of Red Oak, has been occupied continuously,
although sometimes sporadically, since the Archaic period.
Although no sites have been recorded within the immediate study area, a review of the
Lancaster and Waxahachie, TX 7.5’ USGS maps and the Texas Archeological Site Atlas
(TASA) shows an interesting pattern along Red Oak Creek just southeast of the study
area. Multiple gravel pits, several structures and two cemeteries are situated in the
uplands less than 500 meters above the creeks floodplain. No structures were shown
within the pipeline study corridor on the Ellis County Sheet Soil Map (USDA 1910) or
the 1959 Lancaster, TX 7.5’ USGS map. A large gravel pit is mapped at the confluence
of Little Creek and Red Oak Creek. Five sites were recorded along Red Oak Creek in
similar topographic settings southeast of the study area just south of the study area; these
are 41EL52, 41EL150-151, 198 and 245.

Site 41EL52 contained three prehistoric burials, which were eroding out of the caliche
gravel on the east side of Red Oak Creek. The site was recorded in 1956 (TASA 2009).
Further south and adjacent to the creek, the prehistoric site 41EL151 was recorded during
the Superconductor Survey (SSC) (Yedlowski et al. 1998). Bison bones and chert lithic
material was found eroding out of the creek bank and a feature containing burned bone,
charcoal and clay was recorded. Three historic sites were also recorded along Red Oak
Creek, these include a 20th century trash scatter (41EL150) a historic cemetery
(41EL198) and a historic cistern (41EL245). The Couch Cemetery was recorded during
the Superconductor Survey and 23 marked graves dating from 1866 to 1897 were
identified (Yedlowski et al. 1998:142). Surface evidence and plot arrangement led the
surveyors to suggest that additional unmarked graves were most likely present. The brick
cistern was recorded just outside the survey area for the Red Oak Creek Wastewater
Treatment Plant, which is southeast of the study area (Todd 2007). No additional historic
structures, features, or artifacts were recorded.
In order to examine the archaeological potential for the study area, the findings from
previous investigations should be tempered with the more recent data drawn from aerial
photographs that show the extent of development west of the community of Red Oak.
Much of the route crosses through parcels of land that have been cleared of vegetation
were once used for cultivation and pastures and are now part of a housing development.
Wooded areas still line the banks of the creeks, and these areas may have been least
impacted by modern land usage and development.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
To better understand the archaeological potential within the Red Oak Creek Interceptor
study corridor, results from previous investigations must be considered. Previous
investigations within north central Texas, specifically in Ellis County, have identified a
myriad of prehistoric and historic sites. These sites have been identified in a variety of
settings such as uplands, on terraces, at the confluence of streams, in gravel beds and on
floodplains, yet the higher density of sites recorded, both historic and prehistoric, have
been along major stream channels. Therefore, two research questions regarding
prehistoric and historic occupation have been suggested.
Since the majority of the pipeline route follows Red Oak Creek, and eventually crosses
Red Oak and Little Creek, it was anticipated that prehistoric sites might be present. Due
to the presence of recent alluvial deposits in the stream channels, as well as a large gravel
pit to the north, there is potential for both buried and surface sites within the proposed
corridor. Evidence for prehistoric sites might include buried cultural material or features
within the creek banks and surface scatters of lithic or ceramic materials.
Based on the previous investigations and archival research, the potential for historic sites
appears to be low due to the absence of mapped structures within the study area, and the
extensive land clearing that has occurred along the drainages. It appears that the land
north and south of the two drainages has been used for agricultural purposes. Evidence
for historic occupation is most likely limited to discarded trash, located along roads or on
the creek banks.
Methodology
The proposed pipeline route is 2.2 miles long and will have a 100-foot wide construction
easement. The field team walked parallel transects spaced 20 meters apart and made
notes about the ground exposure, surface artifacts, soil types and disturbed areas where
subsoil was exposed. Photographs were taken along the route using a Canon PowerShot
SD600 6.0 mega pixel digital camera. Shovel tests were excavated on average every 100
meters, which is recommended by the Texas Historical Commission (n.d.). Shovel tests
averaged 30 cm in diameter and the clay soils were inspected visually and broken into
smaller chunks in order to determine if cultural materials were present, while sandier
soils were screened through ¼” mesh. Close to each channel crossing, the banks were
stepped and examined for cultural material and a creek bank profile was recorded.
Backhoe trenches were excavated in the floodplain soils and were stepped according to
OSHA standards. Soil profiles were described following the procedures developed by
Vogel (2002) and photographs were taken. Soil from the trench walls, floors and backdirt
was screened in order to explore for any artifacts. Shovel test and trench matrices were
described on the basis of texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to
identify the specific soil colors in each test. The shovel test locations were determined
with a handheld Garmin GPSmap76 receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into four distinct sections. The first consists of a brief description
of the survey area, including information on the pipeline route’s terrain and vegetation.
The section that follows consists of the survey’s results, and is presented in the order that
the pipeline route was surveyed. Though shovel test information is generally discussed in
this section, a complete table of shovel test information is included in Appendix A.
Trench and creek bank profiles follow this section and conclusions close the chapter.
Study Area
The survey area and results are described based upon location within one of three
sections of the route, the eastern section, central section and western section (Figure 2).
The eastern portion of the pipeline route runs west from the eastern terminus of the
pipeline route to the central section where the line splits, and follows the Red Oak Creek
floodplain. The route crosses Little Creek after approximately 50 meters and the channel
is roughly 25 meters wide and 9 to 10 meters deep Running water was present in the
channel at the time of survey to depths of up to 60cm (Figure 3).

The route crossing location of Little Creek on the eastern section of the
pipeline route. View is to the west.

Topography in the eastern section consists of the generally level floodplain, with very
little undulation or obvious widespread erosion. Vegetation in this area is dense,
particularly along the creek channel, and is mainly comprised of a hardwood forest.
Particular trees present in the study area include numerous junipers, red and post oaks,
cedar elms, and pecans, with fewer mesquite, honey locust and bois d'arc situated mainly
in small, isolated clearings along the eastern portion of the line. Ground cover in these
clearings consists of knee high prairie grasses and weeds. Green briar is present
throughout the eastern portion of the pipeline route, and is particularly thick along the
creek channels. Ground visibility throughout the route is poor, between 0 and 10 percent.
However, the final western 200 meters of the eastern section of the pipeline route runs
north through cleared land utilized for livestock grazing and ground visibility was
between 30 and 60 percent (Figure 4).

Area of high ground visibility near the western end of the eastern section.
View is to the south.

The central section of the pipeline route is divided into two separate lines that follow Red
Oak Creek, one on the north side and the other on the south. Terrain and vegetation are
almost identical in this section as the eastern section, with both the northern and the
southern lines tracing the thick vegetation of the Red Oak Creek's floodplain forest, with
the exception of two areas on either line. First, the area in the eastern portion that has
been cleared for livestock extends into the first 125 meters of the central section's
northern line. Additionally, the end of the southern line runs for approximately 120
meters through a stretch of level improved pasture (Figure 5). Both of these areas
exhibited approximately 30 to 45 percent ground visibility, in contrast to the majority of
the pipeline route in the central section, which featured ground visibility of 0 to 10
percent. Both lines cross Red Oak Creek. The southern line crosses approximately 80
meters after diverging with the northern line, and the northern line crosses approximately
100 meters before the two lines' intersection. The channel is similar at both crossings,
with an approximate width of 20 meters and depth of 10 meters. Running water at depths
of up to 65cm was present at both channel crossings.

The western section of the study area west of the split in the pipeline route is situated
mostly on property that consists largely of improved pasture and livestock were present at
the time of survey. The terrain features gently undulating topography south of Red Oak
Creek (Figure 6). Vegetation present in the right of way includes knee to ankle high
prairie grasses, red oaks of advanced age and numerous junipers. The trees were
generally clustered in large isolated stands amid the pastureland until the route moves
north into the tree line that follows the creek. Within the tree line, the number of junipers
increases considerably and the overall amount of vegetation thickens as do green briar
and other thorny vines.

Survey Results
Shovel tests are described based upon the sections in which they fall, moving from east to
west (Figure 7). Survey of the eastern portion of the pipeline route began at the eastern
terminus of the line. The first two shovel tests were excavated in a densely wooded area
on either side of Little Creek. Topsoil consisted of very dark grayish brown sandy clay to
depths of up to 55 cm below the surface (cmbs). East of the creek, this top soil graded to
darker sandy clay that overlay dark gray sandy clay subsoil to 150 cmbs. On the western
side of the creek channel, the top soil was mottled with a yellowish brown sandy loam,
indicative of intermittent flooding. This mottled soil then graded into yellowish brown
sandy loam to 80 cmbs, which overlay brown clay loam subsoil at a depth of 110 cmbs.

Figure 7.

Shovel test locations shown on aerial photograph.

After the channel crossing, shovel tests were excavated at 100-meter intervals for the
remainder of the eastern section of the pipeline route. Shovel test (ST) 3, revealed a
highly stratified soil profile. Dark grayish brown clay loam topsoil was encountered to a
depth of 43 cmbs, and was overlain by increasingly darker clay subsoil. It then graded
from very dark grayish brown to black and reached a depth of 160 cmbs. Shovel tests 4
and 5 both revealed typical floodplain soils, with very dark grayish brown clay loam
topsoil overlaying dark grayish brown loamy clay subsoil. However, the relative depths
of these shovel tests differed significantly. The topsoil in ST4 reached a depth of 90
cmbs, at which depth the subsoil was encountered. The subsoil continued to a depth of
150 cmbs. In ST5, the clay loam topsoil reached a depth of 57 cmbs, before the loamy
clay subsoil was reached. The subsoil then continued to 80 cmbs, where degrading

bedrock was encountered. No cultural materials were recovered or observed in any of the
five shovel tests excavated in the eastern section of the pipeline route, and pedestrian
survey failed to locate any historic structures within the pipeline right of way or any
cultural materials on the ground surface.
As described earlier, the central section of the pipeline route is divided into two lines,
which trace the Red Oak Creek channel on the north side and south side. A description of
survey results in the southern line is presented first.
The southern line of the central section was surveyed east to west. ST6 was excavated at
the point of divergence between the two lines, and revealed a soil profile that would be
repeated in the next two shovel tests and be indicative of their location at the channel
crossing and along the western turn in the creek. Shovel tests 6, 7 and 8 revealed very
dark brown sandy loam topsoil to a depth of 55 cmbs, overlaying dark grayish brown
sandy clay subsoil to depths as deep as 145 cmbs. The sandy clay subsoil in each of these
shovel tests contained CaCO2 that increased in percentage with depth.
ST9 was excavated directly on the creek’s bend, and revealed a similar, yet more
stratified soil profile. The top two horizons were identical to those previously described,
but were underlain by an additional very dark grayish brown sandy clay subsoil from 110
to 145 cmbs. ST10 revealed a far shallower soil profile, with very dark brown sandy loam
topsoil to a depth of 60 cmbs overlaying increasingly darker sandy clay subsoil to 100
cmbs. ST11 was excavated in a cleared improved pasture, and revealed three strata of
sandy clays grading from very dark grayish brown to very dark brown to a depth of 155
cmbs.
The northern line of the central section of the pipeline route was also surveyed from east
to west starting at the point of divergence. Approximately the first 620 meters of the
northern line was in an area with ground visibility that ranged between 30 and 45 percent,
therefore only two shovel tests were excavated. ST12 was excavated in a similar cleared
area that characterized the final 200 meters of the eastern section, and revealed very dark
gray loamy topsoil with pea sized limestone gravels at a depth of 62 cmbs, which graded
to very dark grayish brown sandy clay loam to 85 cmbs and contained smaller gravels.
Very compact black sandy loamy clay underlay the topsoil to a depth of 103 cmbs, where
it became too compact to dig. ST13 was excavated 125 meters west and revealed a top
layer of black clay to 45 cmbs that overlay increasingly brighter loamy clay subsoil,
which graded from very dark grayish brown to dark yellowish brown to 125 cmbs.
The final five shovel tests on the northern line were excavated in wooded areas on either
side of the Red Oak Creek crossing (Figure 8). Shovel tests 14, 15 and 16 were excavated
at 30-meter intervals within two meters of the north bank of Red Oak Creek. They
revealed increasingly shallow soil profiles moving toward the creek that consisted
generally of darker layers of sandy clays that graded from very dark gray to very dark
brown at depths of 112 to 93 cmbs. ST17 was excavated in the densely wooded area
south of the creek crossing, and revealed deeper soil profile, which consisted of dark
grayish brown compact sandy loam topsoil to a depth of 52 cmbs overlaying a deep
compact brown sandy clay loam subsoil to a depth of 160 cmbs. ST18 was excavated in
the same expanse of improved pasture as ST11, and revealed a similar soil profile. No

cultural materials were recovered or observed in any of the shovel tests excavated in the
central section of the pipeline route. Additionally, pedestrian survey of the central section
failed to locate any cultural materials on the ground surface within the pipeline right of
way.

Figure 8.

Terrain and vegetation heading west towards ST14.

The western portion of the pipeline route was surveyed east to west starting from the
intersection of the central lines. Shovel tests 19 through 24 were excavated within Red
Oak Creek’s floodplain forest. They generally featured dark to very dark grayish brown
loamy clay topsoil to depths ranging between 60 and 80 cmbs overlaying increasingly
brighter clay subsoil to depths of 160 cmbs.
ST25 was excavated in a cleared field consisting of semi-improved pasture in an upland
setting, featuring undulating topography. This upland setting was reflected in the shovel
test, which revealed very dark brown clay loam topsoil containing approximately 30 to 50
percent pea to golf ball sized limestone gravels to a depth of 15 cmbs. Degrading bedrock
underlay the topsoil.
Shovel tests 26 through 29 were excavated in a cleared field across a property line fence
from ST25. The topographic setting for these four shovel tests was more consistent with a
floodplain environment, and this was reflected in the soil profiles that were revealed.
These soil profiles were remarkably similar to those encountered in the five eastern
shovel tests conducted in the western section, and consisted of dark brown to black clay
loam topsoil, which overly increasingly lighter loamy clay subsoil to depths of 160 cmbs.
No cultural materials were observed in any of the ten above mentioned shovel tests.
Additionally, no cultural materials were observed on the ground surface within the
pipeline route’s right of way.

Creek Bank Profiles
A total of four bank profiles were excavated with 1, 2 and 3 on Red Oak Creek and 4 on
Little Creek (see Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 9). Profile 1, located on the north bank of Red
Oak Creek, extends for a total of 748 cm before the waterline was encountered. The
boundaries between the five soil horizons were generally gradual and smooth and no
gravels were observed. The soils in the A and B horizons consist of dark brown to very
dark grayish brown loamy clays or clays, while the C horizon is pale brown clay.
Bedrock was not exposed at the base of the profile with only golf ball to fist sized
limestone gravels visible in the ten-meter wide creek channel that currently had running
water. The overall width from the north to south bank was approximately 25 meters.

Bank profile 2, excavated on the south bank of Red Oak Creek, extends for a total of 950
cm before the waterline was encountered. Five horizons were identified with the
boundaries being gradual and smooth with smaller than pea-sized limestone gravels
observed in the B1 horizon. The soils consist of brown to dark brown sandy loams in the
first four A and B horizons and fine sandy clay loam in the C horizon. Bedrock was not
exposed at the profile base, but it was visible in the bottom of the channel and contained
rounded golf ball to fist sized limestone gravels. The overall width of the creek was
approximately 25 meters.

boundaries being generally abrupt and smooth. The two A horizons are composed of very
dark grayish brown to grayish brown sandy loams to a depth of 135 cm. The three B
horizons consisted of very dark grayish brown sandy clays to a depth of 295 cm. The C
horizon consists of pale brown loam with pea to golf ball sized limestone gravels and
shell fossils composing approximately 30 per cent of the zone to 330 cm. The Cr horizon

consisted of very dark brown to grayish brown loams to 240 cm. Three B horizons
followed, containing very dark gray to grayish brown loamy clays to a depth of 560 cm.
The first two C horizons contained very dark to dark grayish brown loamy clay with 10 to
15 percent CaCO2. The final Cr horizon contained evenly mottled gray and strong brown
clays with degraded bedrock to a depth of 850 cm at the waterline. The mottled clay and
numerous rounded limestone gravels were visible on the creek bed below the waterline.
The channel was wider than encountered on Red Oak Creek, approximately 30 meters.

Trench Descriptions
Due to the deep floodplain soils mapped along the Red Oak and Little creeks, trenches
were placed at the six different locations along the route in the floodplain (Tables 3 and 4
and Figure 9). The trench locations deviate slightly from the centerline of the pipeline
route, as several landowners requested that no trees be removed and cause as little
disturbance as possible. Each trench was approximately 4-6 meters long and 2-4 meters
wide. Profiles were done on the flat walls and soil from that wall as well as from the floor
and steps were screened to aid in artifact recovery.

Trench 1 was placed on the north side of Little Creek and west of its split with Red Oak
Creek, approximately 35 meters north of the north bank at the eastern terminus of the
routes (Table 1). The trench was oriented north/south in an undeveloped area that was
surrounded by dense vegetation. The soils varied between dark grayish brown clayey
loam to brown loamy clay. The east wall of the trench was profiled, scraped and screened

and the west wall was stepped. The top two horizons contained abundant fine and coarse
root disturbance from the surrounding vegetation. The boundaries varied between smooth
clear to wavy abrupt. No cultural materials or gravels were present in the trench matrix or
walls.
Trench 2 was excavated in a northeast to southwest orientation, approximately 20 m
south of Red Oak Creek. A thin layer of charcoal was encountered in the east wall of the
trench at 70 cmbs in the A2 horizon (Figure 12 and 13). The east wall of the trench was
scraped and screened, as well as samples of soil from the trench floor and backdirt. No
cultural material was found associated with the charcoal stain. Due to the moderate
proximity to the surface and the lack of cultural materials and gravels, the charcoal may
be a burnt root. No gravels were present in the trench matrix or walls. The soil matrices
were similar to Trench 1.

Trench 3 was placed on the north side of Red Oak Creek, approximately 15 meters from
the north bank near Shovel Tests 15 and 16. This trench was situated towards the center
of the project area on the northern route of the central section. The trench was oriented
northwest/southeast in a grazed pasture filled with large pecan, red oak and post oak
trees. The soils varied between dark grayish brown clayey loam to black loamy clay. The
C horizon was a light olive brown clay with abundant CaCO 2 . The west wall of the
trench was profiled, scraped and screened and the east wall was stepped as done in the
Trench 1. The top two horizons contained abundant fine and coarse root disturbance from
the surrounding large trees (Figure 14). The boundaries varied more than the first trench
and ranged from gradual to abrupt. No cultural materials or gravels were present in the
trench matrix or walls.

Trenches 4 and 5 were excavated on the southern bank of Red Oak Creek on the edge of
the tree lines in grazed pastures. These two trenches were the shallowest trenches dug.
Trench 4 was excavated approximately 60 m south of Red Oak Creek inside the tree line.
The trench is in a low lying area at the bottom of a gradual slope from the south. Erosion
uncovered large exposures of bedrock south of the trench. The trench was oriented
northeast to southwest and was dug to a depth of 150 cmbs. Water began to slowly seep
and fill the bottom corner of the trench, within several minutes the trench held almost 18

inches of water; therefore it was terminated in order to collect the data (Figure 15). The
top two horizons were a dark grayish brown clayey loam and loamy clay. The C horizon
contained abundant limestone pebbles. The boundaries between the horizons were diffuse
and smooth. Approximately 20 m south of the trench, an exposure of bedrock was
examined that demonstrated that there was about 75 cm of fill above the limestone
(Figure 16). Additionally, these exposures of limestone can be seen on the aerials in this
area (Figure 9). Some soil from the back dirt of the trench was screened, yet no cultural
materials were recovered.

Trench 5 was placed approximately 25 meters south of the Red Oak channel and was
oriented northwest to southeast. The soil was loose and varied in color from very dark
grayish brown loamy clays to brown clay. The boundaries between soil horizons were
clear and smooth, except for the A horizon which had a diffuse wavy boundary. Bedrock
was encountered at 130 cmbs and a gravel layer was encountered at 45 cmbs (Figure 17).
The gravel layer was about 45 cm thick and ranged from limestone pebbles to cobbles.
Soil was screened from various areas of the trench, yet no cultural materials were
recovered.
Trench 6 is located at the western terminus of the pipeline route. The trench was
approximately 20 meters from the southern bank of Red Oak Creek and was oriented in a
northwest to southeast direction in a pasture used for grazing. The boundaries between
the horizons in the alluvial soils were mainly wavy, with the majority of them being clear
or gradual. The sandy, loamy soil was loose, and the trench was stepped on the east side
(Figure 18). The soils were generally dark brown or yellowish brown, and the clay C
horizon contained abundant CaCO 2 and small degrading limestone pebbles. The west
wall of the trench was profiled and soil was screened in 10 cm increments immediately
adjacent to the profile to look for any artifacts or gravels that could be present. None
were found.

Conclusions
No prehistoric or historic cultural resources were located on the surface or in any of the 6
trenches, 4 bank profiles and 29 shovel tests. Red Oak and Little creeks show on all
available maps as perennial streams flowing into the Trinity River and given the depth
and width of the channels would have been a good water resource. There certainly was a
substantial amount of alluvial deposition in the floodplains, which given the flat terrain
could have prevented early inhabitants from continuously camping close to the creeks.
The previous investigations along Red Oak Creek and the Soil Conservation Service
descriptions of the area demonstrate that the area surrounding the study area could
contain knappable Uvalde gravels, but none were seen in any trenches or in the creek
channels. Additionally, the area has been developed extensively and it is reasonable to
conclude that no recognizable prehistoric occupation occurred in the area of the pipeline
routes along Red Oak and Little creeks.
The absence of historic sites along the pipeline route may simply be due to the fact that is
situated in a floodplain setting. No houses were shown on the earlier maps along the
routes. However, residences were mapped near the pipeline routes and the area was
farmed historically. Since the routes are located so close to the creek banks, it is unlikely
that houses would have been situated that close. Historic trash scatters along the
drainages were the only type of site reasonably expected, yet none were observed and
could be due to the large scale flooding that occurs along the creeks cutting large wide
channels. In conclusion, it appears that the survey area was farmed in the early 1900s but
not a place where trash was disposed or residences built.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the negative results of the survey and absence of cultural materials within the
study area, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource investigations
are unwarranted. The Trinity River Authority should be allowed to construct the Red Oak
Creek Relief Interceptor, Segment RO-1 without further delay. We further recommend
that if cultural resources are uncovered during construction that work should cease in that
area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission and the US Army
Corps of Engineers Fort Worth Division should be notified.
