ABSTRACT
The City of Lewisville is proposing to stabilize 200 m of the Timber
Creek bank northwest of the intersection of Kenny Court and Regency
Drive in Lewisville, Texas. Approximately 0.9 acres will be impacted.
Halff Associates, Inc., which is handling the environmental permitting,
contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. to survey the project area for cultural
resources. AR Consultants, Inc. conducted the survey on September 20,
2018.
No archaeological artifacts or features were found during the survey.
Given the results of this field investigation, AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that further cultural resource investigations are unnecessary
for this project, and requests that the Texas Historical Commission and
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concur with this recommendation. Records
associated with this project will be curated at the Center for
Archaeological Studies, Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas

INTRODUCTION
The City of Lewisville is proposing to stabilize approximately 200 m of the bank along the
outside curve of a horseshoe bend in Timber Creek northwest of the intersection of Kenny Court
and Regency Drive in Lewisville, Texas (Figure 1). AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) was contracted
to conduct a cultural resource survey, which included archival research, to determine the
prehistoric and historic archaeological presence in the project areas. In the scope of work dated
September 10, 2018, ARC recommended that the bank stabilization area be intensively surveyed
by walking the area to be graded and excavating at least three shovel tests, where the slope was
not too steep. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) agreed with this strategy, and the survey
was conducted on September 20, 2018.
The cultural resource investigation was required because Lewisville is a State entity and Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 8553 was issued for the archaeological survey. Additionally, the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has jurisdiction over the bank stabilization area because it is
along the edge of Timber Creek. Relevant federal and state legislation includes the Antiquities
Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191), Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No. 11593 âProtection and
Enhancement of the Cultural Environment,â and Procedures for the Protection of Historic and
Cultural Properties (36CFR800), Appendix C. The Fort Worth District of the USACE and the
Archeology Division of the THC will review this report.
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines used by the Archeology Division of
the THC (Council of Texas Archeologists 2018). The following report presents a brief
description of the natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the culture
history and previous investigations in the region surrounding the study area. A chapter on the
research design and methodology employed in the investigation is then followed by the results of
the field investigation. The report concludes with recommendations followed by the references
cited.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF TIMBER CREEK BANK STABILIZATION

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area is situated within the Northern Blackland Prairie Ecoregion of Texas. This
ecoregion is composed of rolling to nearly level plains that formed over Upper-Cretaceous marl,
chalk, limestone, and shale (Griffith et al. 2007:61-62). In a climax setting, the Northern
Blackland Prairie is a tallgrass prairie, dominated by big and little bluestem, Indiangrass, and tall
dropseed growing on the regionâs deep, fertile, âblack waxyâ soil, which gives the Prairie its
name. Oak, hackberry, elm, ash, cottonwood, and pecan trees grow in the stream valleys.
The bank stabilization is proposed for the eastern (outer) curve of a horseshoe bend in Timber
Creek. The project area is mapped where the Cretaceous-aged Eagle Ford Formation, Upper
Cretaceous-aged Woodbine Formation, and Quaternary-aged alluvium meet (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1967). These formations consist primarily of shale with thin beds of
sandstone and limestone, while the alluvium deposits are sand, silt, clay, and gravel. The project
area is mapped on Konsil fine sandy loam with 3-8 percent slopes (Ford and Pauls 1980:70).
This series has a 12-in-thick, brown fine sandy loam A horizon above a yellowish-red sandy clay
loam B horizon.

CULTURAL HISTORY
A prehistoric chronology, based on Prikryl (1990), with an added historic period, for North
Central Texas is presented in Table 1 to provide the reader with a temporal framework for the
culture history of the region.

ca. 11,000 B.C.-6000 B.C.
The Paleoindian period is characterized as having small, nomadic bands of hunter-gatherers
whose primary emphasis was the exploitation of now-extinct megafauna, such as mammoth and
bison. Smaller game and plant gathering likely supplemented the Paleoindian diet (Meltzer and
Bever 1995:59). As such, the archaeological record for the region consists of several distinctive
styles of projectile points, such as the Clovis, Plainview, and Folsom. Currently, four Clovis
points have been reported from Denton County, and numerous have been found in surrounding
counties (Bever and Meltzer 2007:67-70). Subsistence patterns began to change as a general
drying climatic trend swept the region, leading to extinction of many of the areaâs large
mammals toward the end of the Paleoindian period.
The Archaic period is characterized by increased alluviation of water channels and a generally
wetter environment than the previous period. This change in climate resulted in modification of
Native American subsistence patterns, with broad exploitation of bottomland food resources.
This, in turn, resulted in clusters of seasonal settlements along large drainages, including the
Trinity River and its various forks and tributaries, and a marked increase in population density.
With the advent of repeated, seasonal occupation of sites along drainages came a perceived
increase in territorial constrictions among different groups in the region, with several authors
citing the limited use of regional lithic resources as evidence of this trend (Prewitt 1983; Skinner
1981).
The Late Prehistoric period is interpreted as a dryer period, with a focus on procurement of
faunal resources, agriculture, and food preservation. The appearance of pottery and the bow and
arrow help date artifact assemblages to this period (Shafer 1977). The Protohistoric period is
characterized by Native American abandonment of North Central Texas in the period around
1500/1600, with almost no archaeological evidence found in the region dating to this time
(Skinner 1988).
The Historic European period saw widespread Anglo settlement of North Central Texas
beginning in the 1830s. This expansion often resulted in brutal conflicts between settlers and

nomadic bands of Native Americans (Garrett 1972:24). These early conflicts gave way to various
Anglo strategies aimed at cohabitation, including peace treaties signed as early as 1843.
Eventually, the entirety of North Central Texas was settled, with numerous Anglo military
installations established in the region. After Texas became part of the United States in 1845,
peace was short lived. The Civil War took its toll on the North Central Texas population, as most
of the able-bodied men left to fight for the Confederacy.
The first established European settlement in Denton County began before the mid-1800s with the
establishment of the Peterâs Colony after Texas independence. These early settlers were farmers
who selected bottomland along the Elm Fork of the Trinity (Bridges 1978). There is very little
evidence of historic-era Native American occupation anywhere in Dallas or Denton County,
although historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the early 1800s. Beginning in the
1830s and continuing into the 1840s, the aboriginal inhabitants continued to play a role in the
regional history. Garrett (1972:24) states, âIndian hostilities almost depopulated North Texas (of
Anglo dwellers) after 1839. It dwindled to less than half.â Hostilities continued until the
Republic of Texas and ten Native American tribes signed the Treaty of 1843. This treaty
provided the impetus for settlement of several North Central Texas counties.
Commercial farming was not important until after the Civil War, and the early settlers were
essentially self-sufficient. Besides domestic plants and animals, wild animals and plants were
commonly consumed. Denton became the county seat in 1856. By 1875, cotton, corn, and wheat
were the main cash crops. Up to half of these crops were grown by tenant farmers who either
paid rent to the land owner for their house, tools, and seed or by tenants who gave the landowner
a third of the grain and a quarter of the cotton or other cash crops. By the turn of the century, all
of the major communities had been established and some had passed away (Odom 2016).
Previous Investigations
A search of TASA (2018) located no historical markers, cemeteries, National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) properties, State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), or archaeological sites
in the project area. However, three survey areas and four recorded archaeological sites are
recorded within a mile of the project area (TASA 2018).
In 1983, the powerline that crosses the creek, running north/south, in the project area was
surveyed. No sites were found in or near the project area during this survey (TASA 2018). In
1991, site 41DN344 was recorded 0.5 miles southeast of the project area on a ridge overlooking
the Timber Creek floodplain. This Late Prehistoric campsite covers an area approximately 300 m
by 200 m and contained intact deposits. The artifacts included ceramics, shell, well-preserved
bone, and multiple hearths. This site was recommended eligible for listing on the NRHP and for
designation as an SAL.
In 2001, a block area approximately 0.6 miles west-northwest of the project area was surveyed
and two sites (41DN516 and 41DN517) were recorded. Both were small scatters of lithic
debitage and fire-cracked rock that were determined ineligible for listing on the NRHP. No other
information is available about this survey. In 2003, ARC surveyed approximately 1.5 miles of
the Timber Creek Trail, which parallels the south side of Timber Creek just east and west of the
current project area (Todd 2003). No sites were found during this survey. Site 41DN331 was

recorded 0.3 miles northwest of the project area, but no information is available about it on
TASA (2018).
The 1918 Denton County Soil Map, the 1936 and 1959 Denton County General Highway maps
(GHMs), and the 1960 (photorevised 1971) Lewisville West, TX USGS topographic maps were
reviewed as part of this research. These maps show no structures in the project area, but the 1918
soil map shows a secondary road along the edge of the creek in the project area. Aerial
photographs from 1963 and later were also reviewed. They do not depict any features until the
housing development starts in the mid-1990s.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Based on the research conducted prior to the survey, two hypotheses were developed. First, it
was hypothesized that there is limited potential for encountering prehistoric archaeological sites
in the project area. The project is located in the unprotected, narrow floodplain of Timber Creek
and would not have been a good location for habitation. Prehistoric sites in the Timber Creek
drainage are typically located in the uplands overlooking the drainage.
The second hypothesis states that there is low potential for encountering historic sites. There are
no mapped structures on the historic maps in the project area. Also, according to aerial
photographs, the creek has not moved significantly in the past 55 years, so the project area
consists of the creek bank, where it is unlikely to have historic sites. However, artifact scatters
constituting dumped trash might be associated with the drainage or old roads, like the one
depicted on the 1918 soils map.
Methodology
Survey was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth by the THC (2014). Field
personnel walked the project areas and placed shovel tests every 100 m where the slope was less
than 20 percent and the ground visibility less than 30 percent. Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in
diameter. All sandy and loamy soils were screened through Â¼â wire mesh screens. Clay fill was
inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine if cultural materials were
present. Shovel test soil matrices were described on the basis of composition, texture, and color.
The Munsell Soil Color Chart (2009) was used to identify soil colors. The author made notes
about the ground exposure, drainages, soil types, and disturbed areas where subsoil was exposed.
Photographs were taken during the survey using a digital, GPS-equipped camera. ST and project
boundary locations were marked with a handheld, GPS receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into two sections. The first describes the project areaâs natural setting
along with results of the pedestrian survey; conclusions derived from the survey close the
chapter. Shovel tests (STs) are described generally in the text and are detailed in Table 2 at the
end of the Survey Results section.
Survey Results
Most of the construction work will take place on the northeast banks in and on either side of the
power line corridor (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The northernmost part of the project area (the treed
portion west of the power corridor) was too steep to shovel test or transect (Figure 2). So, ST1
was placed within the trees, but off the slope. It revealed 25 cm of dark brown sandy loam above
reddish yellow sandy loam, with approximately 5% pea- to golf-ball-sized gravel (Figure 3 and
Table 2). ST2 was placed on the east side of the bank in an area that appeared to be relatively
undisturbed by the nearby development. This ST revealed a similar profile to that of ST1, but
with less gravel and a slightly shallower (15-cm-thick) A horizon. Inspection of the bank reveals
shallow bedrock (Figure 2) and these two STs confirm a thin layer of alluvium atop sterile clay.
The southern edge of the project runs along the backyards of several homes (Figure 4). ST3
revealed an unnatural, heavily mottled clay capped with 7 cm of red clay. This is likely fill from
the construction of the homes.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present in
the proposed Timber Creek Bank Stabilization project area in Denton County, Texas. No cultural
resources were found in the project area. Based on the results of the survey, ARC concludes that
further cultural resource investigations for this project are unwarranted and recommends that the
USACE and THC concur with this assessment. However, if buried cultural materials are
discovered during construction, the Fort Worth Division of the USACE and the Archeology
Division of the THC should be notified.
