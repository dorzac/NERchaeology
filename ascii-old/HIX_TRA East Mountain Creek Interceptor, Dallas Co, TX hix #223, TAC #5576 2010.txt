ABSTRACT
Under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit 5576, Hicks & Company archeologists
completed an intensive, linear 100% pedestrian archeological survey of approximately 23,000
linear feet (4.4 kilometers) of a proposed new sanitary sewer line along Mountain Creek,
between the Cities of Dallas and Grand Prairie in Dallas County, Texas. The project was
sponsored by the Trinity River Authority (TRA), who is replacing an existing, aging sewer line
to meet current and future demands. Cultural resource survey was completed for National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) compliance triggered by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
permitting requirements, as well as state-level Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) compliance
triggered by easements to be owned by an agency that is a political subdivision of the State of
Texas. Additionally, the investigations were recommended by the Texas Water Development
Board (TWDB) prior to funding issuance.
Archeologists completed field inspection
supplemented with 28 shovel tests and 12 backhoe trenches and found the survey corridor to be
devoid of archeological resources. Additionally, surveyors found no historic age structures in
the vicinity of the project corridor. Hicks & Company recommends that the project should be
permitted to proceed with no further cultural resource coordination and no Historic Properties
and/or State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) impacted. Since this survey resulted in no
archeological sites being documented, all project-related materials will be permanently curated at
Hicks & Company’s office in Austin, Texas.

Introduction and Management Summary

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
On behalf of the Trinity River Authority (TRA) and its design engineer Transystems, Inc., Hicks
& Company Environmental, Archeological, and Planning Consultants (Hicks & Company)
completed an intensive linear archeological survey along approximately 23,000 linear feet
(approx. 4.4 km) of the proposed East Mountain Creek Interceptor (EMC) sewer line along the
Mountain Creek floodplain south of the City of Grand Prairie in western Dallas County, Texas
(Figure 1, Plates 1-2). During the survey, archeologists found no evidence of historic or
prehistoric archeological resources. Additionally, surveyors did not observe any historic
structures within the construction corridors vicinity.
The proposed replacement facility will begin immediately west of FM 1382 approximately 1,000
feet (330 m) south of Eagle Ford Drive. From this point, the proposed line extends northnorthwest approximately 8,000 linear feet (2,100 m) along the west side of FM 1382 before
turning toward the northeast, crossing under FM 1382 and eventually Interstate 20 before veering
slightly northward. From Interstate 20, the proposed sewer line parallels Mountain Creek
Parkway approximately 900 feet (300 m) to its west and continues northward for approximately
7,000 feet (2,100 m) before terminating at the existing Mountain Creek Interceptor Number 5
(MC-5) segment approximately 1,200 feet west of the intersection of East Mountain Parkway
and Grady Niblo Road. The TRA intends to leave the existing sewer line, which was installed
between 1974 and 1986, in place and install a new sewer line adjacent to it, offset by
approximately 30 feet (Figure 1, Plates 1-2). The TRA intends to install the pipelines using
open-cut trenching up to ten feet (3.3m) in depth with subsurface boring for crossings beneath
the major roadways. For construction, the TRA intends to acquire a 30-foot permanent easement
(10 m), though actual impacts will be much less (likely within a 15-foot [5 m] corridor). Over its
full 23,000-foot length, this equates to a study corridor measuring approximately 15 acres.
The project area is located within easements that will be owned by TRA, a political subdivision
of the State of Texas. Any earth-disturbing activity at this location is therefore subject to the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). Hicks & Company understands that the project will likely
require some level of permitting through the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
and passes through land partially owned by that entity and therefore is also subject to federal
oversight through Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. In
accordance with Section 106 and ACT guidelines, details of the proposed construction were
coordinated through the Texas Historical Commission (THC), the USACE, and (in accordance
with their MOU) the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). Hicks & Company
recommended that archeological survey of the full interceptor corridor was warranted to assess

Introduction and Management Summary

the potential for impacts to significant archeological sites, and received concurrence from the
TWDB and THC in February of 2010 (see Appendix B).
Conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit 5576, the archeological survey
conformed with the THC’s minimum standards for intensive linear archeological investigations,
using a combination of backhoe trenching, shovel testing, and surface inspection. Twelve
backhoe trenches were placed at opportunistic locations along the Mountain Creek floodplain at
a general interval of one every 1,000 feet (300 m). Additionally, 28 shovel tests were excavated
at a rate of 16 tests per linear mile (one test every 100 meters) in all other locations along the
corridor. One short segment of the line (between FM 1382 and Camp Wisdom Road) was not
subject to subsurface testing due to roadway-related grading and disturbance at various locations.
The survey corridor was found to be devoid of archeological sites or features, or historic-age
structures.
Fieldwork for the cultural resource survey was conducted during late May of 2010 (May 23-28,
2010), requiring approximately 96 man hours to complete. The field crew for this survey
consisted of Mason Miller (Principal Investigator), Josh Haefner (Project Archeologist), and
Gregg Cestaro (Field Archeologist). Renee Pickard provided skillful backhoe services while
Craig Schellbach of Transystems was incredibly helpful in facilitating access to the project
corridor and providing logistical support during the course of investigations. Since this survey
did not encounter any archeological sites, all project related documents and materials will be
maintained at Hicks & Company’s office in Austin, Texas.

Environmental Summary

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located along the floodplain of Mountain Creek in an area that predominantly
is a recreational park area with areas of light residential and commercial use. Below is a
summary of the natural environmental setting for the study corridor.

Geology
For most of its length, the EMC Interceptor corridor extends along the eastern edge of the
Mountain Creek floodplain. Depositional processes of the Trinity River and its associated
drainages have influenced the topography of the project area. The topography is mostly flat to
gently sloping, except for narrow areas with steep slopes immediately adjacent to and south of
the Trinity River. According to the Dallas Sheet of the Geologic Atlas of Texas, four major
geologic formations underlie the project area: Alluvium deposits, Fluviatile terrace deposits,
Eagle Ford Group undivided, and Austin Chalk (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972). Within
the project corridor, alluvial floodplain deposits generally begin at the lowlands immediately
south of the intersection of FM 1382 and Camp Wisdom Road and extend north to the sewer
line’s terminus. These low Quaternary terrace deposits occur along streams and rivers, mostly
above flood level. The overwhelming majority of this alluvium is categorized as Pleistocene
Fluviate deposits (Qt) which likely pre-date human occupation of the region (thus limiting sites
to the ground surface or immediately below); however, the alignment does pass very close to
recent Holocene alluvium (Qal) as well. The remaining two formations, Eagle Ford Group
undivided and Austin Chalk, were formed during the Cretaceous period.

Soils
Information regarding the soils of the project area was obtained from the USDA Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Soil Survey for Dallas County (1980) and the USDA
NRCS Web Soil Survey (2009). A total of seven soil types underlie the project area:
Whitewright loam, 3 to 5 percent slopes; Ferris-Heiden complex, 5 to 12 percent slopes; Heiden
clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Heiden clay, 2 to 5 percent slopes, eroded; Houston Black, clay, 1 to
3 percent slopes; Ovan clay, occasionally flooded; and Ovan clay, frequently flooded.
Whitewright loam, 3 to 5 percent slopes. This soil is a shallow, gently sloping, well drained soil
that occurs mainly on uplands. This soil has moderately slow permeability with very low
available water capacity. Runoff is rapid and the threat of erosion is severe. Below 16 inches
(40.6 centimeters) lies fractured soft limestone. This soil is mainly used for rangeland, but low

Environmental Summary

fertility, droughts, and the shallow root zone are limitations to this use. This soil has medium
potential for urban development or recreational uses due to the shallowness to rock, slope, and
moderately slow permeability.
Ferris-Heiden complex, 5 to 12 percent slopes. This soil occurs mainly on gently rolling and
rolling hillsides. This complex is about 60 percent Ferris soil, 20 percent Heiden soil, and minor
soils make up the rest. The soils in this complex are well drained, with a very slow permeability,
rapid runoff, and a severe hazard of erosion. The climax plant community consists of tall and
mid grasses. These soils are mainly used as rangeland and pasture, but have a low potential for
use as cropland. These soils have a low potential for urban uses due to the very high shrinkswell potential, low strength, corrosivity of the soils, unstable slopes, and hazard of erosion. It is
unsuited for recreation uses due to the clayey texture, very slow permeability, and steepness of
the slopes.
Heiden clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes. This is a deep, well drained, gently sloping soil on uplands.
Permeability is slow, the available water capacity is high, runoff is medium, and the hazard of
erosion is moderate. This soil is mainly used for cropland and pasture with a high potential for
these uses. The climax plant community consists of tall and mid grasses. The yield for forage
and crops is high if the soil is managed properly. This soil has a low potential for urban and
recreation uses due to very high shrink-swell potential, corrosivity, low strength and clayey
surface texture.
Heiden clay, 2 to 5 percent slopes, eroded. This is a deep, well drained, gently sloping soil on
uplands. In most areas, erosion has removed about 50 percent of the surface layer. Shallow
gullies are common and usually about 20 to 60 feet apart. Permeability is very slow, and the
available water capacity is high. Runoff is rapid, and the hazard of erosion is severe. This soil is
mainly used for pasture with good forage yield if the soil is properly managed. The climax plant
community consists of tall and mid grasses. Is has a low potential for cropland due to the severe
hazard of erosion. This soil has a low potential for urban and recreation uses due to very high
shrink-swell potential, corrosivity, severe hazard of erosion, low strength and clayey surface
texture.
Houston Black clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes. This soil occupies smooth ridges or foot slopes that
are both single and complex. The soils consist of deep, moderately well drained clay soils and
are considered to be a poor source for topsoil or road subgrade due to the clay texture, the high
swell-shrink potential, poor supporting capacity, and severe cracking when dry. The soil has a
high resistivity, promoting corrosion of uncoated steel, and a low potential for corrosivity of

concrete. The hazard for erosion is moderate and the soil is well suited for cultivation and
growing native range grasses.
Ovan clay, occasionally flooded. This is a deep, moderately drained, nearly level soil on
floodplains. The floodwater is shallow and of slow velocity. Permeability is very slow and the
available water capacity is high. Runoff is slow with a slight hazard of erosion. This soil has a
high potential for pasture and crops. It has a very low potential for urban uses due to the hazard
of flooding, high shrink-swell potential, corrosivity, and clayey texture.
Ovan clay, frequently flooded. This is a deep, moderately well drained, nearly level soil on
floodplains. The floodwater is shallow and the floods are brief in duration. Permeability is very
slow, with high available water capacity. Runoff is slow and the hazard of erosion is slight.
This soil is mainly used for pasture and rangeland, with a high potential for these uses. The soil
has a low potential for crops due to frequent flooding. It has a very low potential for urban uses
due to frequent flooding, high shrink-swell potential, corrosivity, and clayey texture.

Flora and Fauna
The proposed project lies within the Cross Timbers and Prairies Ecological Area of Texas
(Gould 1960) and in the Texan Biotic Province (Blair 1950). The Cross Timbers and Prairies
Ecological Area is a transitional area between the great plains of the central United States and the
forested low mountains or hills of eastern Oklahoma and Texas. The region is a mosaic of
forest, woodland, savanna, and prairie. The physiognomy of the Cross Timbers is oak wood and
tallgrass prairie. Dominant woody species include post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), bumelia (Bumelia lanuginosa),
and greenbrier (Smilax bona-nox). Forbs of the region include bluebonnets (Lupinus texensis),
Engelmann daisy (Engelmannia pinnatifida), and Maximillian sunflower (Helianthus
maximilliani). Tall and midgrasses are dominant, and include such species as big bluestem
(Andropogon gerardii), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), indiangrass (Sorghastrum
nutans), and sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula). This region is not well suited for
cropland, and is mostly used for rangeland and pastureland. Oil production is also a major
activity in this region (Gould 1960).

Wildlife
Mammal species typical of the Texan Biotic Province include Virginia Opossum (Didelphis
virginiana), Eastern Mole (Scalopus aquaticus), Fox Squirrel (Sciurus niger), Fulvous Harvest

Mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens), Hispid Cotton Rat (Sigmodon hispidus), Deer Mouse
(Peromyscus maniculatus), Eastern Cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), Swamp Rabbit (Sylvilagus
aquaticus), and Black-tailed Jackrabbit (Lepus californicus). Reptiles of the province include
Ornate Box Turtle (Terrapene ornata), Eastern Box Turtle (Terrapene carolina), Green Anole
(Anolis carolinensis), Fence Lizard (Sceloporus undulatus), Eastern Racer (Coluber constrictor),
Coachwhip (Masticophus flagellum), Eastern Rat Snake (Elaphe obsoleta), Common Kingsnake
(Lampropeltis getula), Cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus), and Western Diamondback
Rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox). Typical anuran species include Hurter’s Spadefoot Toad
(Scaphiopus hurterii), Gulf Coast Toad (Bufo valliceps), Woodhouse’s Toad (Bufo woodhousii),
Northern Cricket Frog (Acris crepitans), Strecker’s Chorus Frog (Pseudacris streckeri), Gray
Treefrog (Hyla versicolor), Green Treefrog (Hyla cinerea), Bullfrog (Rana catesbiana), and Rio
Grande Leopard Frog (Rana berlandieri) (Blair 1950).

Land Use
The EMC corridor is largely open parkland and undeveloped rangeland. From the southern
terminus north to Mansfield Road, the proposed transmission line initially crosses through an
area that has been heavily modified by the construction and maintenance of the existing sewer
line. From Mansfield Road to Camp Wisdom Road, the proposed EMC Corridor crosses through
an existing sewer pump station and then through a USACE park facility. Past Camp Wisdom
Road, the project corridor runs through an area that has been heavily disturbed by the previous
construction and maintenance of FM 1382. Approximately 500 meters north of Camp Wisdom
Road, the proposed alignment makes a near ninety-degree turn to the east, crossing under FM
1382. North of IH 20, the Proposed EMC pipeline pathway continues to parallel Mountain
Creek, running adjacent to a modified terrace behind an industrial complex. Near the northern
terminus of the project, the proposed alignment turns northwest and crosses Artesian Creek.
After crossing through the existing transmission corridor the proposed project alignment runs
through an unmodified wooded area for approximately 100 meters before ending at its northern
terminus.

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The project area lies within the easternmost portion of the Plains Archeological Planning Region
as defined by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:4-5). The previous designation for the
region was defined by Suhm et al. (1954) as the North-Central Texas cultural resource area. The
cultural history of the project area can be divided into four main chronological periods following
the research of Prikryl (1990): Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic period.
Prikryl’s (1990) exhaustive synthesis of the prehistory of the region, through the Trinity River
Basin investigations along Elm Fork, is the major source for approaching a working model of the
region’s cultural background.

Cultural Chronology
Paleoindian Period (ca. pre 8500 B.P.)

The Paleoindian period extended from the terminal Pleistocene into the Holocene and was
characterized by a low population base of wide-ranging nomadic bands. Subsistence patterns
during this period may best be described as a generalized hunting and gathering economy, with a
combination of big-game and smaller faunal hunting as well as the collecting of plants (Prikryl
1990). Evidence has been recovered for Paleoindian occupation in North-Central Texas,
however, most of the evidence has been recovered from surface artifact finds, providing little
information about specifics of daily life during this period. The Paleoindian cultures are
distinguished by their distinctive lithic technology, evidenced through the finely chipped,
sometimes fluted lanceolate projectile points.
Within the Trinity River drainage basin, Paleo-Indian sites are commonly surface sites with
mixed assemblages (Meltzer 1987). Projectile points of Plainview and Dalton varieties occur
with the most frequency and their association suggests that the area was a borderlands where
Plainview occupations from the Rolling and High Plains interfaced with the Dalton culture from
areas east (Johnson 1987). Generally, due to mixed contexts, site dating has been done by cross
referencing projectile points with same types from other, more controlled, sites. Cross dating of
the Plainview and Dalton varieties date Paleo-Indian occupations within the area to ca. 9.5-10
years ago (Ferring 1997:5).
More recent investigations at the Aubrey Clovis Site, located north of Lake Lewisville on west of
Elm Fork, has added a good amount to what is known of regional Clovis occupations. The site is
approximately 7-8 meters below the top of the Elm Fork floodplain. While the Lewisville site

Cultural Background

assemblage consisted of more than a handful of artifacts, recovered tool and debitage samples at
Aubrey number over 10,000 (Ferring 1997:5). All of the lithic materials at the Aubrey Site are
non-local and indicative of long distance trade. Analysis of this assemblage indicates that a
curated technological organization coupled with intensive tool utilization was practiced (Ferring
1997:5). Faunal analysis suggests that there was variable exploitation of small, medium and
large game including bison, deer, rabbits, squirrels, fish and turtle. Additionally mammoth
remains have been unearthed at Aubrey although it is not clear if these animals are associated
with subsistence practices (Ferring 1997).
Archaic Period (8500 – 1250 B.P.)

For North-Central Texas, Prikryl (1990) divides the Archaic period into three temporal subperiods: Early Archaic (8500-6000 B.P.), Middle Archaic (6000-3500 B.P.), and Late Archaic
(3500 – 1250 B.P.). Although no discrete Early Archaic components have been isolated in the
region, the projectile points from this period mirror the Paleoindian lack of regionalization and
are mostly made from non-local cherts (Prikryl 1990:69). Additionally, similar to the
Paleoindian period, most of the known sites of the Early Archaic period are located on terrace
surfaces, potentially reflecting a lack of floodplain investigations.
The vast majority of Early Archaic sites in the Trinity River drainage basin are surface sites
recognized by Angostura, Early Split Stemmed and Kirk projectile points and Clear Fork gouges
and their associations in more discriminating contexts in adjacent areas (Byers 2007; Story
1990). In situ sites currently on record are limited to Lake Lewisville, which has an Early
Archaic component as well as Paleo-Indian and Middle Archaic components (Ferring and Yates
1997). Early Archaic components have been recovered during excavations at the Aubrey Clovis
site. Ferring (1989), however, has questioned their context.
With little in the way of isolatable sites in the region, Early Archaic lifeways are hard to define
for North-Central Texas. Generally, it is hypothesized that diffused hunting and gathering
subsistence economies were practiced (Prikryl 1990; Ferring and Yates 1997).
While the Early Archaic period retained many technological similarities to the Paleoindian
period, the Middle Archaic hunter-gatherers are increasingly distinctive. In this region, the
Carrollton Focus, as originally defined by Crook and Harris (1952), encompasses both of these
periods. Subsequent investigations have shown that it may be possible to identify distinct Early
and Middle Archaic periods of surrounding areas (Prikryl 1990). In general, this Early to Middle
Holocene period is characterized as warm and dry initially and becoming wetter around 4500

Cultural Background

B.P. when the Cross Timbers are thought to have first developed (Prikryl 1990). The projectile
points seem to mirror a cultural change as well, by becoming more regionalized toward the end
of the period.
The Calvert Site (41DN102) at Lake Ray Roberts is the only known buried in situ site within the
North-Central Texas region that has a definitive association with the Middle Archaic period
(Byers 2007). Associated with this site were a rock-filled hearth, a flexed burial of an adult male
and an unmixed assemblage of fauna and artifacts. Projectile points associated regionally with
the Middle Archaic are Frio, Trinity, Carrolton, Wells and the basal notched Bell and Calf Creek
types. These points are often used to date surface sites (Prikryl 1990). Prikryl (1990:71-74)
notes that within the middle Elm Fork Trinity Valley there is a noticeable paucity in Middle
Archaic sites when compared to other time periods. Prikryl (1990) attributes this to the
altithermal while Ferring and Yates (1997) note that in addition to dry climate and associated
reduced occupation potential, existing sites may be deeply buried.
The Late Archaic in this region has generally been associated with the Elam Focus (Crook and
Harris 1952). This period, which shows strong affiliations with cultural traditions to the east and
north, is marked by an increase in site density which may indicate an increase in population. An
increase in plant species due to wetter climate conditions may have encouraged further
regionalization during this period and the slight decrease in the overall number of lithic artifacts
made from chert may evidence this trend as well (Prikryl 1990).
In stark contrast to the Middle Archaic, sites dating to the Late Archaic are “by far the most
common in the archaeological record” for North Central Texas (Ferring and Yates 1997: 6).
Prikryl (1990) notes that regional surface collections contain between 2-3 times the amount of
Late Archaic point types than points from other archaeological periods. When compared to the
Middle Archaic the ratio increases to just over 60:1 (Prikryl 1990:52-53). 1997) note that
regional buried Late Archaic sites are generally shallow and easily detected, they offer that this
alone cannot account for their numbers in the archaeological record and posit an increase in
population density. Story (1981) offers that this population increase is the result of a shift in
exploitation strategies, reduced mobility and a climate shift back to more mesic conditions.
Late Prehistoric Period (1250 – 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into two phases, representing early and late
transitional periods: Late Prehistoric I (1250 – 750 B.P.) and Late Prehistoric II (750-250 B.P.).
The Late Prehistoric period represents a significant change from the earlier patterns in the region.

Cultural Resource Survey – East Mountain Creek Interceptor – July 2010

11

Cultural Background

Overall, it is distinguished by the introduction of new technologies, including the bow and arrow
along with the emergence of ceramics, as well as potentially new adaptive strategies such as
agriculture. The Late Prehistoric I period in this region is characterized by projectile points
(Scallorn, Steiner, and Catahoula), which were more commonly made from quartzite instead of
chert during the early stages of this period (Prikryl 1990:77-79). The Late Prehistoric II may
represent the actual introduction of peoples following a southward extension of bison range in
parts of Texas, along with considerable influence from the more settled agricultural peoples to
the north and east. Various unstemmed triangular arrow points representative of this period are
Maud, Perdiz, Fresno, Washita and Harrell.
Historic Period

Although the Historic period theoretically begins in Texas with Cabeza de Vaca and survivors of
the Narvaez expedition landing on the Texas coast in 1528, the initial period of European contact
in this current regional study is not well documented. While the Moscoso expedition may have
traveled through the area in 1542, the first recorded incursion into the region by a European
explorer came in 1788, when Pedro Vial passed through the area on his way from Santa Fe to
Natchitoches, Louisiana. Explorers and settlers ventured into the region more frequently with
time until the 1840s when most of the county was sparsely occupied by the Peters and Mercer
colonies (Elam 2008). Native American groups in the area at this time included the Tonkawa,
Kickapoo, Anadarko, Caddo and Waco. Although native regional groups such as the Wichita
and the Waco survived as relatively cohesive cultural entities until well into the nineteenth
century, the advent of European settlers may have resulted in the disappearance or heavy
alteration of the cultural patterns of many groups (Anthony and Brown 1994).
Previous Investigations and Previously-Recorded Archeological Sites

A review of the THC’s Online Sites Atlas indicates that there are two previous archeological
surveys of the same segment of FM 1382 (one in 1988 conducted by the State Department of
Highways and Public Transportation–now the Texas Department of Transportation, and one
conducted in 1993 for the Federal Highway Administration; Plates 1 and 2) that overlap the
current project corridor. While no additional information was available through online sources,
it is assumed that these surveys were conducted in relation to construction and potential
widening of FM 1382. No archeological sites were encountered within the current project
corridor during either of these surveys. One other survey is recorded on the Sites Atlas for which
no information is available, while a 1994 survey of the City of Dallas’ proposed Emerald Lake
Park, located approximately one kilometer to the project’s southeast, was naturally devoid of
sites within the study corridor. Finally, a survey conducted in 1979 by the Ft. Worth Corps of

Cultural Background

Engineers lies just south of the proposed project’s terminus. Three sites were recorded within
one kilometer of the surveyed area, one of which, Site 41DL268, an early 20th-century
farmstead). The site was considered by recorders to have potential for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) and is
recommended for avoidance. Two recorded archeological sites, Sites 41DL367-368 lie within
one kilometer of the proposed project corridor as well, though no descriptions of the sites are
available on the Sites Atlas. Beyond these, there are no archeological sites, Official State
Historical Markers (OSHMs), or any other recorded significant cultural resources within any
portion of the proposed project corridor. For detailed, tabular data for shovel tests and backhoe
trenches, please refer to Appendix C.

Results of Field Investigations

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Hicks & Company archeologists excavated a total of 28 shovel tests and 12 backhoe trenches
during the EMC field survey (Appendix A, C). All tests were devoid of cultural resources.
Below is a brief summary of the results of these field investigations and the finds made therein.
For ease and clarity of discussion, discussion of the results of archeological field investigations
will be divided into four segments: Segment 1 (the southern terminus north to Camp Wisdom
Road), Segment 2 (Camp Wisdom Road to FM 1382), Segment 3 (FM 1382 to Interstate 20),
and Segment 4 (Interstate 20 to the northern terminus).

Segment 1: Southern Terminus to Camp Wisdom Road
From the project’s southern terminus moving north, Segment 1 is located entirely on the west
side of FM 1382 (Figures 2-5). Measuring approximately 2,100 meters in length, this segment
passes through USACE-owned Joe Pool Lake Park property that is variably undeveloped, open,
grassland prairies with gently-rolling hills descending to the lower Mountain Creek floodplain
and thick stands of hardwood trees and forbs. Surveyors did not encounter any standing
structures that would be considered historic with the segment largely devoid of architectural
features. With the exception of a metering station, through most of its length, archeologists did
not document any evidence of significant disturbance within the segment. Vegetation was found
to be moderate to tall prairie grasses and scrub with ground surface visibilities ranging from 0nearly 100 percent with an average of 20-30 percent in most areas. Fourteen shovel tests (all
negative for archeological materials) were excavated along the segment (JH1-4, 8-11, GC1-3, 68, Plates 1 and 2). Small portions of the segment had excellent surface visibility (between
Shovel Tests JH3 and GC3, JH8 and JH9) or clear evidence of disturbance (access road and
metering station disturbance in the vicinity of JH4) and were not subject to subsurface testing.
Due to the upland setting of the segment, no backhoe trenches were excavated within the
segment.
Soils were found to be thick, upland variety clays with abundant gravels and carbonates reached
at a typical depth of 30-50 centimeters below the ground surface. Shovel Test JH2 provides a
typical column for Segment 1 with the first 23 centimeters composed of 10YR 4/3 dense brown
clays transitioning to a gravelly 10YR 5/4 yellowish brown subsoil clay beneath to the test’s
terminus at 41 centimeters below the surface. The test terminated in impermeable, sterile
subsurface clays.

Segment 2: Camp Wisdom Road to FM 1382
Segment 2 is a short (600 m), heavily disturbed segment of the proposed EMC corridor passing
north of Camp Wisdom Road. For nearly all of its length the project centerline passes along
introduced, sloping fill used to raise FM 1382 above the surrounding, low grade (Figures 6 and
7). No structures were encountered in the vicinity of the study corridor within Segment 2.
Vegetation primarily consists of short to tall, prairie grasses with moderate to low surface
visibility, though the segment, due to disturbance, was not intensively investigated. The
northern-most 50 meters of the segment are less disturbed, but pass along a low-probability
lowland landform directly adjacent to the creek channel. Citing the abundance of disturbance
along the corridor and the overall low probability for encountering intact subsurface deposits, no
shovel testing or trenching was conducted within Segment 2.

Wisdom Road.

Segment 3: FM 1382 to Interstate 20
Moving north and east of FM 1382, Segment 3 measures approximately 1,300 meters in length,
passing through undeveloped grassland that is relatively flat. After crossing under FM 1382, the
proposed EMC sewer line follows a northeast alignment that parallels the existing pipeline
corridor closely. From the turn under FM1382 until its intersection with IH 20, the proposed
corridor runs through a low-level floodplain area that has been moderately disturbed by prior
sewer line construction and maintenance (Figure 8). From its intersection with FM 1382, the
proposed pathway generally parallels Mountain Creek until its northern terminus. Much of the
area between FM 1382 and IH 20 is overgrown with secondary growth (Figure 9). Where
vegetation has been cleared south of IH 20, it is due to the presence of an electric transmission
line corridor which runs perpendicular to the proposed EMC line (Figure 10).Segment 3
terminates at a low, artificial creek drainage ditch feeding Mountain Creek to the south and is
bisected by a second such artificial drainage channel at its midpoint (Figure 11). Vegetation
within the segment includes portions of short to moderate grasses, patches of thick wildflowers
(Figure 12), and riparian vegetation zones with thick plants standing taller than the surveyors in
some locations. Overall surface visibility ranged from 0-100 percent (south to north,
respectively) with a 30 percent average overall visibility.

Archeologists excavated nine shovel tests (JH5-7, 12-15, GC4-5) and two backhoe trenches
(BHT 11 and 12) within Segment 3, limiting mechanical excavations to areas away from marked
utilities. All subsurface tests were devoid of cultural materials. Backhoe Trench 12 (Figures 13
and 14), excavated approximately 150 meters northwest of FM 1382, was excavated to 66
centimeters in dense, 2.5YR 4/2 weak red mottled upland clay with abundant carbonates and
gravels throughout. Archeologists noted a light complement of modern trash (a plastic motor oil
bottle, shards of clear bottle glass) throughout the upper 40 centimeters of deposits and, citing
disturbance within the trench as well as a clear lack of Holocene deposition, did not extend the
trench beyond 66 centimeters.

Backhoe Trench 11 (Figures 15), excavated approximately 400 meters north of Backhoe Trench
12 in tall riparian grasses and weeds, contained reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8) introduced bedding
soil (excess backfilling soil scattered around after utility installations, in this instance likely
attributed to the original EMC line) in the upper 37 centimeters of otherwise 2.5Y 3/2 very dark
grayish brown spongy, moist clay. From 37 to 65 centimeters, bedding soil was absent as clays
became distinctly more compact and dense, remaining 2.5Y 3/2 in color. From 65 to 91
centimeters, Trench 11 contained 4/3 olive brown colored, very dense, compact clay with
carbonate precipitates and gravels increasing with depth. The trench was terminated at 91
centimeters below the surface.

Results of Field Investigations

Shovel Test GC5 contains upland soils typical of the northern half of the segment. Here the
upper 20 centimeters of sediments contain 7.5YR 4/3 brown and 10YR 5/4 brown dense clay
loams. Below 20 centimeters the 10YR 5/4 brown dense clay continues with the increasing
inclusion of gravels and iron oxide fragments. The test terminated at a depth of 40 centimeters.
As mentioned above, modern trash was encountered within Backhoe Trench 12. Additional
modern trash was encountered within Shovel Test JH14 from 0-18 cmbs, including several
shards of clear bottle glass intermixed with small flecks of charcoal. This deposit has been
attributed to a recent trash burning episode. Trash deposits correspond to portions of the
segment immediately north of the junkyard and all materials are likely associated with that
facility. Aside from the introduced trash, no cultural materials were encountered on the ground
surface or within any of the subsurface tests within Segment 3.

Segment 4: Interstate 20 to Northern Project Terminus
Segment 4 measures approximately 2.5 kilometers in length, passing along the outer edge of the
Mountain Creek lowland channel floodplain immediately west of a modern packing, shipping,
and industrial park (Figure 16). No other structures were noted in the project vicinity. The
study corridor is very flat and densely populated with riparian grasses, wildflowers, cedar,
hackberry, and other hardwoods with vines and briars noted within the segment’s many tree
motts. Along this stretch, the EMC corridor crosses through an area that has been extensively

altered by the existing sewer line corridor, a high pressure gas line, an existing transmission line
and associated construction and maintenance (Figures 17 and 18). Older-growth hardwood
forest was found in the short northern terminus, west of the cleared electrical transmission line
corridor (Figure 19). Ground surface visibility generally was very low throughout the segment,
often estimated at 0-10 percent. While occasional scatters and piles of trash were noted, modern
disturbance was relatively low throughout the length of the segment. Immediately east of the
cleared electrical transmission line, near the northern terminus, archeologists did note a sign
indicating a subsurface gas pipeline crossed the sewer line corridor, however, this was the only
clear indicator of subsurface disturbance beyond the existing sewer line the current survey
paralleled.

Being located within mapped floodplain deposits, Segment 4 was extensively subjected to
subsurface tests including five shovel tests (GC9-13) and ten backhoe trenches (BHT 1-10). All
tests were negative for archeological materials or features. Backhoe Trench 2 (Figures 20 and
21), was excavated 400 meters north of Interstate 20. The upper 30 centimeters of sediments in
Trench 2 contained 10YR 3/4 dark yellowish brown silty clays with occasional carbonate and
limestone inclusions. The upper zone also contained a scatter of bedding soil similar to that
observed in Trench 11 in Segment 3. From 30 to 68 centimeters, soils transitioned to 7.5YR 4/2
brown silty clays with a noted increase in calcium carbonates. To a depth of 130 centimeters
sediments retained the coloration but were much harder and more compact clays. Finally, to the
trench’s terminus in sterile subsoil at approximately 200 centimeters below the ground surface,
soils were 10YR 5/4 yellowish brown very hard clays with no inclusions.

Backhoe Trench 4 (Figure 22), excavated approximately 600 meters to the north of Trench 2,
contained 70 centimeters of 10YR 4/4 dark yellowish brown clay loams overlying 80 centimeters
(to 150 cmbs) of dense clays with gravels and pebbles. From 150 to 275 centimeters, blocky
clay mottles were noted along with a distinct increase in caliche granules beginning at 175
centimeters. The trench was terminated at 275 centimeters in sterile subsoil. Backhoe Trench 7,
excavated approximately 800 meters to the north, contained a similar soil column through 220
centimeters of sediments. Trench 9 (Figure 23), excavated in dense woods at the northern
terminus, contained approximately 155 centimeters of 10YR 4/3 brown clays and clay loams
with gravels through the upper 40 centimeters and carbonate flecking beginning at 79
centimeters. The trench transitioned to 7.5YR 5/4 dense clays at 155 centimeters with moderate
to heavy carbonate inclusions increasing with depth to the trench’s terminus at 215 centimeters
below the ground surface.

Results of Field Investigations

Figure 23: Backhoe Trench 9.
Backhoe Trench 6, excavated approximately 300 meters south of Trench 7, did contain an
unusual accumulation of animal longbones intermixed within likely buried creek channel
deposits. The trench contained 70 centimeters of 7.5YR 4/4 brown silty clay with occasional
limestone inclusion and rabdotus shell. From 70 to 90 centimeters soils included a marked
increase in limestone and chert gravels, pebbles and occasional small cobbles. Within this zone
archeologists recovered eight bone fragments attributed to a medium to large mammal (Figures
24 and 25). All fragments were approximately 5 centimeters in diameter or less. No lithics or
charcoal or any other cultural features were encountered in the same level. Dense, somewhat
gravelly clays continued to approximately 135 centimeters before inclusions increased markedly
in size and density with depth. Archeologists recovered two additional longbone fragments, this
time likely from a small mammal or bird, between 140 and 160 centimeters below the surface.
Again, no cultural materials or features were encountered at the same elevation as the smaller
bone fragments. Both bone deposits are likely remnants of natural phenomenon, and citing a
lack of associated artifacts or features, are not attributed to cultural activity. The trench was
terminated at 160 centimeters below the surface in likely buried channel deposits.

An additional trench (Trench 8: Figure 26) was dug approximately 20 meters south of BHT 6 to
investigate the landform further for possible archeological materials that could be associated with
the bone fragments. The soil column did not contain any bone fragments or archeological
materials though occasional snail shell fragments were noted in the upper trench elevations. The
trench, excavated to a maximum depth of 213 centimeters, contained soils that were more typical
of other portions of the segment rather than the channel deposits noted in Trench 6: introduced
bedding soil in the upper 50 centimeters; dense, uniform clays and clay loams throughout;
carbonates near the terminus, increasing with depth. Trench 8 demonstrated that the channel
deposits encountered within Trench 6 were isolated and additional exploration for cultural
deposits associated with the bones was not warranted.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of the Trinity River Authority, Hicks & Company archeologists have completed a
linear, 100% pedestrian cultural resource survey along approximately 23,000 feet (4.4 km) of a
proposed replacement East Mountain Creek Interceptor sewer line for National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 and Antiquities Code of Texas compliance. With a 30-foot overall
construction and maintenance easement width, archeologists investigated approximately 15
acres. At this time, the Trinity River Authority intends to leave the existing East Mountain
Creek Interceptor in place unaltered, allowing it to be re-enlisted into service at a future date if
additional capacity is required. Since the existing line will not be impacted in any way by the
installation of the new interceptor line, it will not result in any potential impacts to archeological
resources.
Archeologists had access to all portions of the proposed construction corridor at the time of
survey and conducted thorough surface inspection supplemented with a total of 28 shovel tests
and 12 backhoe trenches. None of the tests excavated contained archeological features, artifacts
or other evidence of cultural resources, nor were any non-archeological historic structures noted
in the vicinity. Archeologists found the study corridor to be largely undeveloped with only
isolated pockets of modern disturbance from infrastructure and roadway construction.
Additionally trash deposits were encountered near the transmission line’s center, but the
materials observed were modern items likely attributed to the junkyard located a short distance to
the south. Additionally, one backhoe trench (Trench 6) contained two pockets of animal bones,
but these were found directly above and within likely buried channel deposits and the bones
themselves were most likely deposited at the find location by natural actions.
Based on the results of extensive backhoe trenching, shovel testing, and surface inspection,
regulatory clearance for the project to proceed relative to the Trinity River Authority’s
responsibilities under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Antiquities
Code of Texas is recommended with no Historic Properties and/or State Archeological
Landmarks affected. In the unlikely event that cultural materials are found during construction,
all work in the area should cease until such time as the Texas Historical Commission can be
contacted and a professional archeologist can assess the finding and make recommendations
deposit significance and need for future investigation (should it be required).
This report is offered in partial fulfillment of the requirement of TAC Permit 5576. Since no
artifacts or sites were found during the course of survey, all project-related materials will be
maintained at Hicks & Company’s offices in Austin, Texas.
