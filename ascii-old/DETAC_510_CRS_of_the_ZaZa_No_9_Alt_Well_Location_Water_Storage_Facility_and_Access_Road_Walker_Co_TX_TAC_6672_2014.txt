ABSTRACT
On the 2nd and 23rd of October 2013 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants
(DETAC) conducted a cultural resource management survey of the proposed ZaZa #9H
Alt well location, water storage facility, and access road north of Huntsville, Texas. The
project area is on land managed by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice; therefore,
Texas Antiquities Permit #6672 was obtained. The well location and water storage
facility were separate areas. The access road, 9.9 km (6.2 mi) long, will utilize existing
improved gravel roads with two segments of new construction roughly 2,552 m (8,376 ft)
long. The pedestrian survey was conducted with a combination of visual examination
and shovel testing in the new construction areas. Shovel testing along the access road
segments and water storage facility were negative while shovel testing at the well
location documented 41WA314 as a scatter of prehistoric lithic debris and a small
mammal bone fragment in four of 15 shovel tests on the summit of a narrow ridge. Deep
sandy soils, bioturbation, and the artifact count, variety, and distribution suggest the site
is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP. Artifacts from 41WA314 were curated at the
Stephen F. Austin State University Anthropology Laboratory. No further investigations
are recommended; however, if any cultural material is recovered during construction,
then excavation should stop and DETAC contacted to evaluate the impact. DETAC is
requesting concurrence with the determination of “no effect” on NRHP eligible
properties for the proposed ZaZa #9H Alt well location, water storage facility, and access
road.

INTRODUCTION
In October 2013, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resources survey of the ZaZa #9H Alt well location, water storage
facility, and access road roughly 7 kilometers (km) (4 miles (mi)) northwest of Riverside,
Texas (Figure 1). Proposed construction includes clearing and leveling the well site,
building berms to create a water storage facility, and construction of an access road rightof-way between existing improved gravel road segments. The project area is on property
managed by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice; therefore, the archaeological
survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #6672.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries.

Shovel testing at the well location

documented 41WA314 as a prehistoric artifact scatter at the well location. Deep sandy
soils, bioturbation, and the artifact count, variety, and distribution were not indicative of
finding cultural features. 41WA314 is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP. No
cultural resources were found during the surface inspection shovel testing of the water
storage facility or access road segments. The report was prepared following the short
report format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (2005a) with
modifications requested by the THC (Martin 1999). DETAC requests concurrence with a
determination of “no effect” to properties listed or eligible for the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP).

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project included construction of a well pad 168 x 122 meters (m) (550 x 400
feet (ft)), a water storage facility 168 m (500 ft) square, and an access road 9.9 km (6.2
mi) long in a corridor roughly 12 m (40 ft) wide. The access road includes two new
sections totaling 2,552 m (8,376 ft) along with portions of an existing improved gravel
road network across the property. Combined, the well pad, water storage facility, and
new access road segments total roughly 7.5 ha. (18.5 ac.). Topographically, the well
location will occupy a low ridge and adjacent swales in the Trinity River floodplain. The
water storage facility is in the middle of the floodplain and the access road will cross
Turkey Creek and adjacent upland ridges to F.M. 3478 at the property boundary.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Walker County was surveyed in both large and small scale investigations. Largescale investigations including research within specific drainage systems.

Extensive

excavations on large sites were conducted across the region providing most of the
prehistoric and historic cultural information. The earliest excavations were conducted at
the C.W. Ellis site (41PK1) with Paleo-Indian to Late Archaic components and the Carl
Matthews site (41PK2) with Late Archaic to Historic period components. Substantial
investigations began in the 1960s for Lake Conroe and Lake Livingston, e.g., Nunley
1963. The Lake Conroe surveys documented over 230 sites (Shafer 1968) while work in
Lake Livingston area recorded over 200 sites (McClurkan 1968). Smaller investigations
include work on National Forest (e.g., Shafer and Baxter 1975), pipelines (e.g., Gadus
1988 and Moore et al. 1999), and private development (e.g., Kotter et al. 2000).

These

surveys generally show that sites were found adjacent to stream channels in the
floodplains on first terraces or along the toe slopes of higher ridges.
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region. Initially,
Aten (1983) described coastal adaptation while Shafer and others (1975) described inland
adaptation along the lower Trinity and Neches rivers to the north. D.A. Story (1990) and
J.A. Guy (1990) discussed the area as part of their description of the Gulf Coastal Plain
which extends from southern Arkansas to the Gulf Coast. Finally, Ricklis (2004:181-204)
has the most up to date description of the southeast Texas region which extends from the
Gulf Coast to Angelina County.
The project area is in the Southeast Texas Archaeological region (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993:211; Perttula 2004:Figure 1.1). The Cultural Chronology for this region is
divided into Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Early Ceramic, Late Ceramic, and Historic periods.
The Paleo-Indian period (prior to 7500 B.C.) is the earliest documented cultural period in
the New World and includes populations that inhabited North America from the Late
Pleistocene to the early Holocene. The Paleo-Indian period is characterized by small,
mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and animals
principally distributed in the valleys of major stream basins (Ricklis 2004:184). The
Archaic (7500-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally

3

specialized approaches toward exploiting a changing environment and surviving with an
increasing population.

When compared to Paleo-Indian artifacts, Archaic lithic

assemblages are more functionally varied; however, tool types are generally less well
made and of increasingly more local materials than the Paleo-Indian period and earlier
Archaic (Ricklis 2004:184). The Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800) period is the first
part of the Late Prehistoric (Story 1990:293, Fields et al. 1983:27-30 and Ensor et al.
1991:Figure2), but it is also referred to as the Woodland period (Aten 1984;74, Perttula
2004:Table 1.1).

The Early Ceramic period represents the diffusion of Tchefuncte

ceramics and later Goose Creek ceramic technology into the area from the Texas-Louisiana
coastal area (Aten 1983:297; Ricklis 2004:189). The Late Ceramic period (A.D. 8001700) populations living in the Walker County area were Bidias (associated with the Gulf
Coast Goose Creek tradition), but they traded with the Caddo culture to the northeast
(Ricklis 2004:200). The Historic Period (1700 A.D. - present) describes both the history
behind the current cultural setting of the area and marks a transition from the native
populations’ domination of the area to the American immigrants’ establishment of farms,
towns, and counties. The area of Walker County was initially inhabited by American
settlers in the 1820’s when Pleasant Gray was granted a league of land by Mexico where he
established the “Huntsville” trading post.

Initially, Walker County was part of

Montgomery County but it became independent in 1846 and Huntsville was named the
county seat. Americans came to the area increasing the population of farmers and their
slaves as the land was planted in cotton in the 1850’s and 1860’s (Leffler 2012).
Transportation of crops initially involved travel along the Trinity River (Utley and Corbin
2000:8). Production dropped dramatically after the Civil War and Reconstruction fueled
racial tension, but the county was saved further hardship by the arrival of the railroad in the
1870’s. Cotton, grown by sharecroppers, kept the economy operational until the arrival of
the railroad in 1871 and the lumber industry in the 1880’s. Siviculture, which dominated
the economic setting into the 1950s, was joined by oil/gas exploration in the late 1930s.
The economy continues to rely on siviculture and oil/gas exploration; however, tourism to
the Sam Houston National Forest and industry have added significantly to the modern
economy (Baldwin 2013).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with the Texas Antiquities
Code following survey standards described by the Texas Historic Commission (2013)
and report guidelines set forth by the CTA (2005b). All fieldwork and reporting comply
with the ethics standards of the Texas Archaeological Society and the Register of
Professional Archaeologists.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2013). The atlas contains a current
database with published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys, location
maps, and cultural resources records. In addition, these records show State Archaeological
Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites.
DETAC conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area relying on
shovel testing and visual examination to locate archaeological sites within the Area of
Potential Effect (APE). Shovel testing included excavating an area approximately 30
centimeters (cm) square in 10 cm (4 in) levels down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35 in).
According to the THC guidelines, the 4.4 ha. (10.8 ac.) areas for the well pad and water
storage facility areas required a minimum of two shovel tests per every one acres while the
access road segments required a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile. Following these
guidelines, the pedestrian survey included a surface inspection focused on areas with
exposed soil (e.g., erosional features and ant mounds) along with a minimum of 48 shovel
tests. Shovel test locations were recorded with Ashtech GPS units with sub-meter postprocessing accuracy. Notes were made about soil color, texture, and shovel test depth.
Upon finding an artifact, shovel tests were excavated along the landform to
determine the site boundary. Negative tests and landforms were used to create a site
boundary. Artifacts were collected by shovel test number and level. A soil profile and a
State of Texas Archaeological Site Data Form were completed for each site discovered.
Field sketch maps were completed for all sites and color photographs were taken to
document the physiographic setting. Artifacts were washed, cataloged, and analyzed to
determine cultural affiliation. DETAC curated all site forms, artifacts, maps, and photos
along with other data at the Stephen F. Austin State University Anthropology Laboratory in
Nacogdoches, Texas.

RESULTS
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas
(2013) found three archaeological investigations and seven archaeological sites within
1.6 km (1 mi) of the project area (Appendix A). The surveys included two for the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) and one for Trinity River Authority.
Initially, Goodwin and others (1998) surveyed three 5-acre tracts in Walker and
Madison Counties. Of these tracts, one is located roughly 350 m (1,148 ft) west of an
existing improved gravel road that will be used for the proposed access road. Site
41WA229 was recorded as a multi-component prehistoric/historic period site with lithic
debitage, fire cracked rock, burned bone, historic earthenware and an aqua-colored glass
bottle base.

Further investigations were recommended as the site has potential for

inclusion to the NRHP.
SWCA surveyed two parcels for the Estell State Prison Unit west of F.M. 3478
(Drake 1999).

A total of seven sites were recorded: Sites 41WA246, 41WA247,

41WA249, 41WA250, and 41WA251 were recorded as prehistoric lithic scatters while
site 41WA252 was recorded as a Late Ceramic site because ceramic sherds were found,
site 41WA253 was recorded as a Late Ceramic site because an Alba arrow point was
found, and site 41WA248 was recorded as a historic period artifact scatter with a
sandstone foundation block. All seven sites were found in deep sandy soils on ridge
summits or shoulders. No further work was recommended for the sites.
The most recent archaeological survey within one mile of the project area was
conducted by Moore Archaeological Consulting for waterlines along F.M. 3478 and F.M.
980 (Moore et al. 1999). The survey revisited 41WA65 and recorded 41WA187 and
41WA188. Site 41WA65 was initially recorded in 1974 as an Early Ceramic site with
sherds and projectile points.

The revisit to the site found lithic debris, a hand-cut

sandstone, and historic period ceramic sherd.

Sites 41WA187 and 41WA188 were

recorded as lithic scatters. No further work was recommended for the sites.
One additional survey was conducted by Horizon Environmental Services for an
area along Nelson Creek in the Trinity River floodplain (Murin 2000). The survey

6

documented 41WA255 and 41WA256 as prehistoric sites during backhoe trenching.
Further testing was recommended despite the surface disturbance documented on both
sites.
These previous investigations suggest archaeological sites are most likely found
in sandy soils along elevated landforms overlooking stream channels on either uplands or
in the Trinity River floodplain.

Based on the previous investigations, the current

investigations included identifying and shovel testing the sandy soils in the APE at a high
probability intervals (30 m (100 ft)) and areas with both clayey soils and further from
surface water at low probability intervals (50 to 70 m (165 to 230 ft)).

Well Location
The well location is on the edge of the first terrace roughly 1,175 m (3,850 ft)
south of the modern Trinity River channel. Topography is dominated by parallel ridges
and swales on this portion of the terrace. The proposed well location encompasses a 121
x 167 m (400 x 550 ft) area centered on the summit of a low ridge defined by swales to
the northeast and southwest (Figure 2). An improved gravel road with drainage ditches
will be used for access along the north side of the well location. Construction will
include cutting the ridge and filling in the swale to create a level pad area. Vegetation is
exclusively pasture grasses with variation is several species differentiating the sandy
ridge from the adjacent swales (Figure 3). Soils at the well location are described as
Kaman-Elysian variant complex (26). Kaman series soils are described as deep, poorly
drained clay soils with slick-n-slide features in the swales.

Elysian series soils are

described as very deep, well drained soils that formed in the Cretacious on the ridges.
The profile includes a fine sandy loam roughly 74 cm (29 in) deep over a weak Bt
horizon of loam in excess of 183 cm (72 in) deep. Yellowish brown mottles are obvious
roughly 112 cm (44 in) below the ground surface (NRCS 2013).
The pedestrian survey included a visual inspection of several cattle trails crossing
the area, cattle wallows, and ditches along an improved gravel road along the northern
edge of the site followed by shovel testing across the proposed pad area.

No artifacts

were found during the surface inspection but a large burnt tree stump was found near the
western edge of the well location.

Shovel tests were excavated across the well pad area with additional tests
focusing on the ridge summit. Tests in the swales ranged from 20 to 40 cm (8 to 16 in)
deep in sandy clay loam over dense clay similar to the Kaman soil description. Shovel
tests on the ridge were 50 to 90 cm (20 to 36 in) deep in fine sandy loam. Rodent
disturbances, random charcoal, and burned wood were common in the upper levels of the
shovel tests while yellow and red mottles were common in the lower levels of the shovel
tests. Shovel testing was successful in recovering artifacts in four of the 15 tests along
the crest of the ridge. The summit of the ridge was recorded as 41WA314.
Site 41WA314 was recorded as a prehistoric lithic scatter on the narrow summit
of a ridge bound by swales to the northeast and southwest (Appendix C). Vegetation on
ridge includes several species of grass and Wooly Croton which marked the ridge's
prominence while the surrounding swales were mainly shorter pasture grasses. Cattle
trails crisscross the ridge and swales. An improved gravel road with rock surface and
drainage ditches along either side ran east to west at the north end of the site.
Shovel testing on the ridge found eight artifacts in four of 15 tests. Artifacts were
found in levels 1 through 7 (10 to 70 cmbs) include five Petrified wood tertiary flakes,
one piece of petrified wood shatter, one large chunk of quartzite, and a fragment of a
small mammal bone most similar to the distal end of a rib. The flakes are all 10 to 20
mm (0.3 to 0.9 in) in size. The shatter is roughly 25 mm (1.0 in) in size and the chunk of
quartzite is roughly 60 mm (2.3 in) in size. The quartzite does not show signs of heating
and is presumed to be shatter involved with knapping process.
To summarize, 41WA314 is a prehistoric lithic scatter on the summit of a narrow
ridge in ridge/swale topography on the edge of the first terrace in the Trinity River
floodplain. A total of eight artifacts were found in four of 15 shovel tests on the summit
of the ridge. Vertically, artifacts were found in every level with no clear occupation
horizon. Bioturbation and the loose sandy soil are not conducive for preserving cultural
features. Based on the artifact count, variety, and distribution; the potential for finding
intact cultural features or information to assist in a better understanding of the regional
prehistory is limited. The site is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP. No further work
is recommended for the well location.

Water Storage Facility
The Water Storage Facility is a 168 m (500 ft) square area in a pasture that will be
used to collect water for drilling operations. Construction of the facility will include
pushing soil from the center of the area to the perimeter to create a shallow pond. The
water will be transported to the well location through a pipeline laid on the ground
surface. Soils are the same as the well location with Kaman clay in swales and Elysian
sandy loam on ridges.
The archaeological survey found the water storage facility was in a broad
floodplain with no ridge/swales as described in the soil survey. The areas between the
access road, the water storage facility, and the well location were visually examined as
these areas will receive vehicle traffic without a defined road; there will be no subsurface impacts. The visual inspection focused on ant mounds, animal burrows, and
cattle trails. No artifacts were found during the surface inspection. A total of 12 shovel
tests were excavated in sandy clay to depths between 20 and 30 cm (8 and 12 in) at the
water storage facility. No cultural material was observed in the shovel tests. No further
work is recommended for the water storage facility.

Access Road
The proposed access road will utilize existing improved gravel roads with
construction of two new road segments from the well location approximately 9,951 m
(32,649 ft) to F.M. 3478. The two new access road segments will be 12 m (40 ft) wide
and include a short segment, 615 m (615 m) long, adjacent to Turkey Creek where it
enters the Trinity River floodplain and a long segment, 1,937 m (1937 m) long, between
an existing pond and F.M. 3478. The total length of new access road right-of-way is
2,552 m (8,376 ft).
The short segment, 615 m (2,017 ft) long, is in a pasture between an upland ridge
to the west and the Turkey Creek stream channel to the east. Soils are described as
Houston black clay (23) along the toe slope of the ridge and Kaman clay (25) adjacent to
the Turkey Creek stream channel. Both soil series are described as black clay in excess
of 203 cm (80 in) deep. A total of ten shovel tests were excavated along the centerline
(Figure 4). All ten tests were excavated to 20 cm (8 in) in black clay. No cultural

material was observed in the surface inspection of scattered ant mounds or in the shovel
tests. No further work is recommended for this segment.
The long segment, 1,937 m (6,355 m) long, spans Turkey Creek and follows the
summit of an upland ridge between an existing pond and F.M. 3478. Soils include
Annona (2) loam 25 cm (10 in) deep over red clay on the upland ridges near the creek
crossing, Arol (4) fine sandy loam 15 cm (6 in) deep over black clay along Turkey Creek,
and both Elmina (11) loamy fine sand 80 cm (32 in) deep over gray clay and Falba (13)
fine sandy loam 20 cm (7 in) deep over grayish brown clay along the ridge summit.
Vegetation was mixed. Scattered areas were mature hard wood trees with a light to
moderate understory and other areas were planted pine trees with a moderate to dense
understory. These areas were separated by unimproved logging trails. Ground cover was
mostly leaf litter with scattered patches of grass.
A total of 38 shovel tests were excavated along the segment (Figure 5). Observed
soils were similar in texture and depth to the described series; close to the Turkey Creek
crossing tests were between 10 and 50 cm (4 and 20 in) deep in sandy loam soil, while
tests along the ridge summit ranged from 20 to 80 cm (8 and 32 in) in sandy loam soils.
Shallower soils were noted, but are most likely the result of modern siviculture. No
artifacts were observed during the surface inspection or found in the shovel testing effort.
No further work is required for the segment.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Construction of the proposed ZaZa #9H Alt well location, water storage facility,
and access road will require new construction at the well location, water storage facility,
and roughly 2,552 m (8,376 ft) of new access road right-of-way on the Ellis Unit of
Texas Department of Criminal Justice property northwest of Riverside, Texas. The
remainder of the access road will utilize the existing network of improved gravel roads.
Texas Antiquities Permit #6672 was obtained and all requirements of the permit were
met in the course of the archaeological investigations.
Shovel testing of the well location was successful in finding one prehistoric lithic
scatter (41WA314). The site included seven lithic flakes and a bone fragment from a
small mammal found in four of 15 shovel tests excavated on the summit of a low ridge.
Artifacts were found between levels 1 and 7 (10 to 70 cmbs) with no clear horizontal or
vertical clustering. Additionally, bioturbation dominated the soil profile and random
pieces of burned wood were found in the upper levels from recent pasture maintenance.
Based on the artifact count, variety, and distribution; the potential for finding intact
cultural features or information to assist in a better understanding of the regional
prehistory is limited. The site is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP.
No cultural resources were found during the surface inspection shovel testing of
the water storage facility or access road segments. There is little chance of encountering
cultural resources eligible for inclusion to the NRHP in the project area; however, in the
event that human remains and/or archaeological materials are discovered during
construction, then the project activity will immediately cease and both DETAC and the
THC shall be notified of the discovery.

DETAC requests concurrence with a

determination of “no effect” to properties listed or eligible for the NRHP as defined by
the National Historic Preservation Act.
