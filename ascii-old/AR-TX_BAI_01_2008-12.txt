ABSTRACT
Between December 4 and 8, 2006, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton &
Associates), at the request of AIA, Inc., and on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s
(TxDOT) Abilene District, conducted intensive archeological surveys at three off-system bridges in
Scurry County, Texas prior to proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction
(CSJs: 0908-19-018, -019, and -020). The three project areas included CR 195 (locally signed as CR 488)
at Deep Creek (CSJ: 0908-19-018), CR 136 (locally signed as CR 4138) at Big Sulphur Creek (CSJ:
0908-19-019), and CR 245 (locally signed as CR 397) at Canyon Creek (CSJ: 0908-19-020). Survey of
the project areas augmented by backhoe trenching discovered no cultural resources within the proposed
project areas and curation was unnecessary.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Investigations for Three Off-System Bridge Replacements in Scurry
County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and an intensive
archeological survey with shovel testing and backhoe trenching prior to proposed roadway and bridge
improvements on CR 195 (locally signed as CR 488) at Deep Creek (CSJ: 0908-19-018), CR 136 (locally
signed as CR 4183) at Big Sulphur Creek (CSJ: 0908-19-019), and CR 245 (locally signed as CR 397) at
Canyon Creek (CSJ: 0908-19-020). Surface and subsurface investigations discovered no cultural
resources within the project area.
The proposed bridge replacements and roadway improvements would occur within the existing right-ofways (ROW), which range between 30 feet and 65 feet wide. The existing concrete or wooden bridges
would be removed and replaced with new pre-stressed concrete slab bridges, while the approximately
150-foot long approach roadways at each bridge would be widened and paved to match the width of the
new bridges. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) at each crossing includes the full width of each ROW,
as well as the lengths of the planned bridges and improved approach roadways. The proposed APE for
archeology, therefore, measures approximately 355 feet long and 30 to 40 feet wide (encompassing
approximately 0.32 acre) on CR 195 at Deep Creek; 365 feet long and 30 to 50 feet wide, (encompassing
approximately 0.42 acre) on CR 136 at Big Sulphur Creek; and 365 feet in length, and roughly 60 to 65
feet wide (encompassing approximately 0.54 acre) on CR 245 at Canyon Creek. Subsurface impacts
would extend approximately 10 feet or less below the natural ground surface. No additional ROW or
temporary or permanent easements will be required for construction.
PROJECT LOCATION: The linear project areas are in southern Scurry County near Snyder and Ira,
Texas.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 1.28 acres
DATE OF WORK: December 12–15, 2006.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc. is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (and subsequent amendments) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young

COMMENTS: Based on the lack of archeological deposits within the project areas, Blanton &
Associates, Inc. recommends that the proposed construction be allowed to proceed as planned within the
existing ROW at each bridge location without additional cultural resource investigations. If the planned
construction should require additional work space outside of the existing ROWs, then additional cultural
resource investigations in those areas would be necessary.

INTRODUCTION
Between December 12 and 15, 2006, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton &
Associates), at the request of AIA, Inc., and on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s
(TxDOT) Abilene District, conducted intensive archeological surveys at three off-system bridge locations
in Scurry County, Texas prior to proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction
(Figure 1). The three project areas included CR 195 (locally signed as CR 488) at Deep Creek
(CSJ: 0908-19-018), CR 136 (locally signed as CR 4138) at Big Sulphur Creek (CSJ: 0908-19-019), and
CR 245 (locally signed as CR 397) at Canyon Creek (CSJ: 0908-19-020). The project areas are in
southern Scurry County near Snyder and Ira, Texas. The proposed construction would occur within the
existing right-of-ways (ROWs), which range in width between 30 and 65 feet.
On CR 195 at Deep Creek (CSJ: 0908-19-018) the proposed Area of Potential Effect (APE) measures 355
feet long and approximately 30 to 40 feet wide. County Road 195 is a 12 to 15-foot wide dirt and gravel
road with no shoulders (Figure 2). The existing wood and metal bridge is about 35 to 40 feet long and 12
feet wide with one 10-foot wide lane. Proposed construction would include spanning the creek with a
55-foot long and 26-foot wide pre-stressed concrete T-beam structure with two, 12-foot wide lanes
(Figure 3). The 150-foot long approach roadways would be widened and paved to match the width of the
proposed bridge. Construction schematics provided indicate that vertical impacts will extend
approximately 10 to 12 feet below the existing ground surface and that the planned construction would
not require new, temporary or permanent easements or new ROW. The proposed APE encompasses
approximately 0.32 acre.
On CR 136 at Big Sulphur Creek (CSJ: 0908-19-019) the proposed APE measures 365 feet long and
approximately 30 to 50 feet wide. County Road 136 is an approximately 15-foot wide dirt and gravel road
with no shoulders (see Figure 2). The existing one lane wood and metal bridge is roughly 30 feet long and
12 feet wide with one 10-foot wide lane. Proposed construction would include spanning the creek with a
65-foot long and 26-foot wide pre-stressed concrete T-beam structure with two, 12-foot wide lanes
(Figure 4/5). The 150-foot long approach roadways would be widened and paved to match the width of
the proposed bridge. Construction schematics indicate that vertical impacts will extend approximately 10
to 12 feet below the existing ground surface and that the planned construction would not require new,
temporary or permanent easements or new ROW. The proposed APE for archeology encompasses
approximately 0.42 acre.
On CR 245 at Canyon Creek (CSJ: 0908-19-020) the proposed APE measures 365 feet long and
approximately 60 to 65 feet wide. County Road 245 is an approximately 12-foot wide paved road with
two six-foot wide lanes (see Figure 2). The existing bridge is roughly 35 feet long and 12 feet wide with
two six-foot wide lanes. Proposed construction would include spanning the creek with a 65-foot long and
26-foot wide pre-stressed concrete T-beam structure with two 12-foot wide lanes (Figure 5). The 150-foot
long approach roadways would be widened and paved to match the width of the proposed bridge.
Construction schematics indicate that vertical impacts will extend approximately 10 to 12 feet below the
existing ground surface and that the planned construction would not require new, temporary or permanent
easements or new ROW. The proposed APE encompasses approximately 0.54 acre.

As the planned construction would occur on property owned by the State of Texas and administered by
TxDOT, the projects are subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in
Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary conditions for
recognition and preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any political
subdivision of the State of Texas, defined as a “local governmental entity created and operating under the
laws of this state, including a city, county, school district, or special district created under the Texas
Constitution, Article III, §52(b)(1) or (2), or Article XVI, §59” in 13 TAC §26.5 of the code, must
identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage
those SALs.
It is assumed that funding for the proposed highway construction will come in part from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed construction project is also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the
NHPA is to protect significant cultural resources that might be threatened by actions that are federally
funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The Act, which created the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP), states that the
ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any cultural resources eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or actions funded or permitted by federal
agencies.
The federal regulatory process is described in detail in the ACHP regulations (36 CFR 800) and in the
regulations of the agencies and federal divisions engaged in historic preservation. Protection of cultural
resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on site significance as defined
by National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Although the ACHP is the final arbiter of the Section
106 process, in practice, the process is typically limited to review and concurrence by the involved agency
and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented in Texas by the THC.
Investigations were conducted in accordance with the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA)
among the FHWA, the THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) among TxDOT and THC. The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological
survey methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the
Guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC
in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was
to identify and describe all cultural resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their potential
eligibility for nomination to the NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should significant cultural
resources be located, make recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as
avoidance, preservation, or further investigations.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The proposed project area is located in the Rolling Plains ecological region of Texas, which is
characterized by a gently undulating to rolling plain. Elevations across the Rolling Plains range from
approximately 1,000 feet in the eastern margins of the region to 2,200 feet at the base of the Cap Rock
Escarpment on the region’s western edges (Jordan et al. 1984). Climatic conditions in Taylor County are
semi-arid with long, hot summers and mild winters. Rainfall is heaviest in the spring and fall, with
roughly 23 inches of annual rainfall. Open range surrounds the study area.
GEOLOGY
The three study areas are underlain by Permian age Whitehorse Sandstone and Cloud Chief Gypsum,
undivided, which consists of interbedded sandstone, gypsum, sand, and dolomite (Barnes 1974).
Although there is no Holocene alluvium mapped for the bridge locations, such deposits are indicated at
different locations along Big Sulphur, Canyon, and Deep Creeks (Barnes 1974) upstream and downstream
from the project areas. Given the scale of the Texas Geologic Atlas maps and the presence of recent
alluvium within other parts of these drainages, there is the potential that the CR 136, CR 195, and CR 245
project areas do contain recent alluvium with possible buried cultural materials.
SOILS
Soil in the CR 136 project area is identified as Latom soils, which are shallow calcareous soils that
developed in situ on upland ridges and natural drainages. A typical profile exhibits approximately six
inches of very fine sandy loam overlaying calcareous sandstone. Soil in the CR 195 and CR 245 project
areas is identified as Spur clay loam, a deep calcareous soil that developed in loamy alluvium on flood
plains. Representative profiles exhibit at least 60 inches of prismatic, dark brown and brown calcareous
clay loam with calcium carbonate filaments and threads within the A1, B, and C horizons (Dixon et al.
1973).
VEGETATION
Scurry County lies in the Kansan biotic province (Blair 1950). Vegetation is a mixed-grass plain
dominated by little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and
western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii). A mesquite-grass association is common and dominated by
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), with various species of grama (Bouteloua spp.), three-awn (Aristida
spp.) and broomweed (Gutierrezia texana). Shorter grass species include buffalograss (Buchloe
dactyloides) and various grama grasses. Land use adjacent to the bridge locations is cropland and
rangeland.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A review of records of available on the THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) was
conducted to determine the presence of any previously recorded sites or previous project areas within a
1,000-meter radius of each bridge location. No sites or previous project areas were found within the
search radius for either project location. Although there are no archeological sites within or near the
various APEs, there was a potential for the recent alluvium in each project area to contain buried cultural
deposits.

METHODS
The intensive archeological surveys on CR 195 at Deep Creek, CR 136 at Big Sulphur Creek, and CR 245
at Canyon Creek involved surface and subsurface investigations of sufficient intensity to determine the
nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of any discovered cultural resources. Investigations
adhered to THC survey standards (n.d.), as well as the guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists
(1987), and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983). Moreover, the survey
was designed and executed in accordance with the PA among the FHWA, the THC, the ACHP, and
TxDOT, as well as the MOU between TxDOT and the THC.
Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the project areas by two
archeologists systematically examining the ground surface for cultural remains. When possible, cutbank
profiles were inspected for the presence of any buried cultural materials, as were any road cut profiles
within the APE. As the project areas contain alluvium with the potential to contain intact buried cultural
deposits, subsurface investigations consisted of backhoe trenching.
Excavated backhoe trenches were approximately 5.0 meters (16.4 feet) long, 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) wide,
and 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) deep and plotted with a hand-held global positioning system (GPS). Following
excavations, archeologists immediately cleaned and examined trench walls to locate any in situ artifacts,
cultural features, and/or soil anomalies in the trench profiles. Stratigraphic units identified in each trench
were then described in detail on a Blanton & Associates geologic profile form. In areas were there were
buried utilities, trenching was not conducted due to narrow ROW conditions and shovel tests were
excavated instead. All trenching activities were monitored by archeologists to avoid any unnecessary
damage to potentially buried cultural deposits. Field investigations were thoroughly documented with
digital cameras. No cultural materials were collected so curation was unnecessary.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Intensive archeological survey at the three bridge replacement locations indicated that the existing ROWs
are narrow and have been disturbed by erosion and roadway construction. The distance between the ROW
boundary fences and the edge of the roadways varied between nine and about 30 feet. Erosion along the
banks of the creeks and around bridge pilings was common. Additional minor impacts include fence lines
that parallel the roadways, as well as few surface and subsurface utilities. Deep subsurface investigations
involved the excavation of four backhoe trenches at each bridge location.
CR 195 AT DEEP CREEK (CSJ: 0908-19-018)
Intensive survey investigations at Deep Creek indicated that the existing CR 195 ROW has been disturbed
by roadway construction (Figure 6). As Figure 7 indicates, the space between the ROW boundary fences
and the edge of the roadway was quite narrow. Adjacent land use was range. Surface examination of the
APE revealed no prehistoric or historic cultural resources, only occasional modern roadside debris.
A total of four backhoe trenches (nos. 1–4) were excavated on CR 195, one in each quadrant of the creek
crossing (Appendix A, see Figure 6). Each trench exhibited two or three soil zones and extended to
maximum depths of between 178 and 194 centimeters below ground surface (see Appendix A).
Excavations revealed an abrupt or clear and smooth lower boundary between Zones I and II in every
trench (Figure 8). Zone I is of a mixture of gravel, clay and sand construction fill so the boundary
between Zones I and II appears to be the result of the truncation of the upper portion of Zone II during
roadway cut-and-fill construction.. Stratigraphic zones delineated below Zone II in each trench were
intact, though bioturbation (i.e. roots, insect, and rodent) was evident. Backhoe trench excavations
discovered no prehistoric or historic cultural materials.
Field investigations found no cultural resources within the CR 195 APE. Given the disturbed conditions
throughout the APE and the survey results, it is unlikely that any intact, previously unidentified cultural
resources would be impacted by the planned roadway improvements.
CR 136 AT BIG SULPHUR CREEK (CSJ: 0908-19-019)
Intensive survey investigations at Big Sulphur Creek indicated that the existing ROW is narrow and
disturbed by roadway construction and maintenance activities (Figures 9 and 10). As Figure 11 indicates,
erosion was evident throughout the ROW and APE. Adjacent land use consisted of range. Surface
examination of the APE revealed no prehistoric or historic cultural resources, only occasional modern
roadside debris.
Backhoe trenching was possible in all four quadrants of the creek crossing (see Figure 9). Excavated
backhoe trenches (nos. 1–4) contained three to five soil zones and extended to maximum depths of
between 220 and 280 centimeters below ground surface (see Appendix A). As with the investigations on
CR 195 at Deep Creek, abrupt to clear and smooth lower boundaries were observed in all four trenches
between Zones I and II (Figure 12). Zone I is of a mixture of gravel, clay and sand construction fill so the
boundary between Zones I and II appears to be the result of the truncation of the upper portion of Zone II

during roadway cut-and-fill construction. Diffuse charcoal flecking was observed throughout Zone II but
there was no evidence of any cultural features (see Figure 11). The deeper zones (III–V) in BHTs 1–4
appeared intact. No prehistoric or historic cultural materials were discovered during excavations.
Field investigations found no cultural resources within the CR 136 APE. Given the disturbed and eroded
conditions throughout the APE and the results of the survey, it is unlikely that any intact, previously
unidentified cultural resources would be impacted by the planned roadway improvements.
CR 245 AT CANYON CREEK (CSJ: 0908-19-020)
Intensive survey investigations on CR 245 revealed impacts to the APE from roadway cut-and-fill
construction, as well as a buried phone cable along the west side of the roadway (Figures 13 and 14).
Adjacent land use consisted of range and small agricultural fields at a nearby farm. Surface examination
of the APE revealed no prehistoric or historic cultural resources, only modern roadside debris.
Backhoe trenching was possible in all four quadrants of the creek crossing (see Figure 13). Excavated
backhoe trenches (nos. 1–4) contained three or four soil zones and extended to maximum depths between
220 and 250 centimeters below ground surface (see Appendix A). As with the investigations on CR 195

and CR 136, excavations on CR 245 revealed abrupt to clear and smooth lower boundaries between
Zones I and II in each trench (Figure 15). Zone I is of a mixture of gravel, clay and sand construction fill
so the boundary between Zones I and II appears to be the result of the truncation of the upper portion of
Zone II during roadway cut-and-fill construction. The deeper zones recorded in BHTs 1–4 appeared
intact. No prehistoric or historic cultural materials were discovered during excavations.
Field investigations found no cultural resources within the CR 245 APE. Given the disturbed conditions
throughout the APE and the survey results, it is unlikely that any intact, previously unidentified cultural
resources would be impacted by the planned roadway improvements.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive survey efforts found no cultural resources within the APE on CR 195 at Deep Creek, CR 136 at
Big Sulphur Creek, and CR 245 at Canyon Creek. Backhoe trenching revealed gravelly clay and sand
construction fill overlying clayey and/or loamy and sandy subsoils. The upper portions of Zone II in all of
the excavated trenches have been truncated by roadway construction. The disturbed lower boundary
between Zones I and II range in elevation from as shallow as 28 centimeters below ground surface to as
deep as 84 centimeters.
Given the results of the field investigations, Blanton & Associates recommends that there is little to no
potential for the proposed bridge replacement construction projects to impact any previously unidentified
prehistoric or historic cultural resources within the various APEs and, therefore, the projects should be
allowed to proceed as planned without additional cultural resource investigations.
If it is determined that TxDOT requires additional ROW for the proposed bridge construction projects or
for future construction projects in adjacent areas, then additional cultural resource investigations are
recommended for those areas. In the event that previously unidentified cultural materials are discovered
during construction, work in the immediate area would cease and the TxDOT archeological staff would
be contacted to initiate accidental discovery procedures in accordance with the aforementioned PA and
MOU.
