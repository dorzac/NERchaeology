INTRODUCTION

>1 1

Bundle burials, where the tightly flexed
corpse is swathed inhides or matting, are the
most common prehistoric mortuary practice
known in the arid lands of southwest Texas
and adjacent northern Mexico. The combina
tion of a near-desert climate and interment in
dry rockshelter deposits has resulted in the
excellent preservation of organic materials
in partial mummification.
and occasionally
Over 150 bundle burials have been exhumed

deterioration (Alexander

in technology (Turpin
1978), or advances
1982). Although the settlement pattern still ap
parently centered upon rockshelters, the first
evidence forpossible remnants of temporary
upland structures may be attributable to this
phase. The fiber industry is technically ad
vanced (Andrews and Adovasio
1980; Adova
sio 1977), retaining itsaffinities with northern
Mexico. Several
different pictograph styles
have been identified in the Lower Pecos River
region, but none can be securely attributed
to the Blue Hills phase. Bundle burials, such
as SMM, are the dominant mortuary practice.

THE BUNDLE BURIAL
The Skiles Mummy (SMM) epitomizes the

rockshelter interments of the Late Archaic
period. The burial can be reconstructed as
follows: at, or shortly after death, the body
was bound in a tightly flexed position, arms
bent and knees drawn up. The corpse was

ina rabbit furcape and a stone and
dressed
ina deer hide, hair
bone necklace; wrapped
side inside; and enfolded ina series of mats,
progressively more coarsely woven. This bun

of hair

dug into the occupational debris near thewall
of 41VV656. Although this grave was not as
elaborately furnished as some Lower Pecos
examples, SMM's burial was apparently not
a hasty or ignominous disposal.
A string of at least 15 stone and 2 bone
beads was probably hung around the neck

(Table 2, Fig. 3). The hairstringhad broken

only 57 cm remain, so the exact se
quence of the beads cannot be established,
but the segments
remain as theywere when
the bundle was opened. One stone bead has
only been seen on the X-ray of the preserved
viscera: it is implanted in the abdominal cavity

with only one side protruding. Itappears

Such a pattern of severe dental pathology
is uncommon among prehistoric populations
which are normally characterized
by well
worn but undecayed
teeth retained inmore
or less complete sets until at least the age of
40. The moderate
wear on the teeth of
younger individuals, coupled with the loss or
severe decay of molars, suggests that exten
sive premature tooth loss resulted from the
onset of intense carious processes
and not
from extremely heavy wear which would per
forate the pulp chambers with subsequent
infection. Heavy wear on the remaining teeth
of the middle-aged
adults results from the
early loss of other teeth and the concentra

would be the use of pain killers or narcotics

based on the types of pro

The widespread

Inasmuch as bundle

the factors gov

In the Lower Pecos, some small shelters
or alcoves off larger sites were used soley as

burial chambers (Collins 1969; Greer and
Benfer 1963;Dibble and Prewitt1967).Greer
and Benfer (1963) suggest thatthe Langtry

Creek Burial Cave was an ossuary, the recep
tacle of a mass secondary burial. A multiple
primary burial of at least four, possibly five,
individuals was uncovered inFate Bell Shelter
(Pearce and Jackson 1933). Cremation with

The careful treatment accorded

contradicts the commonly stated assumption
that hunter and forager societies placed little
value on the young. When viewed in the con
text of Late Archaic economics,
however,
these infant bundles may reflect the relaxa
tion of population control mechanisms.
The Skiles Mummy is only one example
of the remarkable preservation afforded by
the near-desert climate and the dry rock
shelters characteristic of this region. All the
mummified burials of the Lower Pecos cul
tural area are a long-neglected source of
specific information on arid lands hunter and
