Abstract

Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC), Kyle, Texas, performed an intensive cultural resources
survey of the AT&T Fiber Optic Line 7734084 right-of-way (ROW) along the east and west sides of
FM1402 north of Mt. Pleasant in Titus County. The survey area measured 18.56 miles long by 24 feet
wide. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) measures 9.28 miles by 24 feet wide by 3 feet deep and is
located on the east side of the existing FM1402 ROW.
The ROW where AT&T plans to install the fiber optic line is owned by TxDOT, making the project
subject to the Texas Antiquities Code which requires a project review by the THC. The THC
recommended an intensive cultural resources survey of the ROW be performed due to proximity to known
archeological sites. TITAN Engineering, on behalf of AT&T, contracted with APC to conduct the survey.
APC performed an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing in accordance with Texas Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5726.
The results of the survey were negative; no new or existing archeological sites or cultural
resources were found in the APE. No artifacts were observed, collected, or curated. For this reason, APC
concludes that no significant eligible archeological and/or historic properties will be affected by the new
construction and no further work is needed. APC, therefore, recommends that construction proceed, as
planned.

AT&T Fiber Optic Line 7734084

1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
AT&T proposes to install a fiber optic line in an existing right-of-way (ROW) of FM1402 in
Titus County, Texas inside an easement owned by the Texas Department of Transportation
(TXDOT). Because the ROW is located on publicly owned land, requirements of the Texas
Antiquities Code apply, including review of the proposed project by the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
The agency review resulted in a recommendation to perform a cultural resources survey of
the ROW, due to its proximity to multiple known archeological sites. TITAN Engineering, Inc.,
on behalf of AT&T contracted with Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC) to perform an
intensive pedestrian survey of the proposed ROW in accordance with the Texas Archeological
State Survey Standards.
The ROW is on the east side of FM1402 inside an existing easement that contains
underground utilities. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) extends for 9.28 miles from Nw12
Road, north of Mount Pleasant, to FM3290 (Ne5 Road), south of White Oak Creek, near
Wilkinson, Texas. The route passes through historic and modern communities of Hart’s Bluff,
Oak Grove, Gladewater, and Midway, Texas.
The results of the intensive cultural resources survey of the AT&T Fiber Optic Line 7734084
were negative. No new archeological or historical sites were found inside APE and/or the
FM1402 ROW. No artifacts were observed during the survey, therefore, no artifacts were
discarded or curated. Profiles observed in open trenches do not contain cultural strata to depths of
36 inches. Shovel testing at three creek crossing locations was also negative. Outside the APE,
fifteen cultural resource locales were observed during the survey that will not be affected by the
proposed activity.
Of the thirteen properties seen, three were historic buildings outside the ROW, within 100
feet of the APE. Of the three structures, two are mid-twentieth century and one is early twentieth
century Victorian style. The Victorian house has the potential to be eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and /or as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
The three historic buildings located east of FM1402 will not be affected by the installation of
the fiber optic line cable. The ten cultural resources observed west of the FM1402 ROW will not
be affected by the proposed activity. Therefore, no significant archeological and historic
properties eligible or potentially eligible will be affected. Construction should proceed, as
planned, without additional cultural resources work or consultation.
If unexpected cultural resources are uncovered during the remaining trenching and boring
activity, digging should stop at the location. The THC should be notified by telephone at (512)
463-6096. The discovery should be evaluated by archeologist in consultation with the THC
before digging resumes.

2.0 AT&T FIBER OPTIC LINE 7734084, TITUS COUNTY, TEXAS
2.1 INTRODUCTION

AT&T proposes to install a segment of fiber optic line in an existing Farm-toMarket Road (FM) 1402 ROW easement north of Mount Pleasant, Texas (Figure 1). The
line will be installed in the unpaved part of the ROW on the east side of the road. It will
begin at Nw5 Road and continue north through Harts Bluff, Gladewater, and Midway, to
terminate at FM2390 near Wilkinson, Texas in Titus County, Texas. Portions of the
ROW have been trenched and the cable has been installed and/or is being installed
(Figure 2). The trenching activity provided a view of subsurface soils and strata. Boring
under roads, driveways, and creeks has not yet begun.

2.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The 10 feet wide construction ROW is inside an existing 24-feet wide easement from edge of
FM 1402 pavement to private property fence lines. The fiber optic line will be installed in a 2 feet
wide permanent easement. The existing ROW already contains a fiber optic line, a waste water
line, a water line, and a telephone line.
The APE is about 9.28 miles in length by 10 feet wide by 3 feet deep. It is situated inside the
existing unpaved TxDOT ROW on the east side of FM1402 from NW12 ca. 1 mile north of
Mount Pleasant, Texas to FM3290 (Ne5). In addition, the west side of the ROW was also
covered, as originally planned, to ensure that the previously known site locations were viewed.
The part of the FM1402 ROW covered is shown on the project Storm Water Protection Pollution
Plan dated May 2010 (see Appendix I).

2.3 PROJECT AREA
Environmental Setting
The project area is located north of Mount Pleasant in northeast Texas (Figure 1). .It is in the
Eastern Timbers physiographic region (Raisz 1957). It is situated in the Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest
vegetative region of Texas (Arbingst et al. 1976). The project area is subject to long hot summers,
while winters are short and cool. Annual precipitation is about 46 inches. Prevailing winds are
from the south and draw in moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
The ROWs run roughly north to south through hilly terrain and strip mine areas. Surface
geology is comprised of Eocene era formations (BEG 1979).Terrain is hilly and divided by
streams and tributaries. The route crosses Hart Creek and its tributaries which drain into Cypress
Creek Tributaries of Stinking Creek are also crossed by the route. The area’s major drainage,
White Oak Creek, is north of the project area. Stinking Creek and White Oak Creek and are part
of the Sulphur River drainage.
Soils
Three types of general soil areas are present along the proposed ROW (Roberts 1984).
The Hart Creek Drainage is lined in Nahatche-luka loamy soils. Woodtell-Freestone loamy soils
cover uplands adjacent to the creeks. At the highest elevations, Wolfpen-Pickton sandy soils are
present. Inside the proposed ROW are clay loams, sandy loams, and sand (Table 1).

Roberts (1984) provides detailed soil data for the project area and it is summarized here
starting at the south end of the project area and moving north. Nahatche Loam-Silty Clay Loam
is only found along Hart Creek and is made up of silty clay loam (0-6 inches below the surface
[bs]s), silt loam (7-44 inches bs), clay loam (45-68 inches bs), over loam (69-80 inches bs).
Woodtell Fine Sandy Loam, 2 to 5 percent slope, is present on Hart Creek stream terraces. Sandy
loam (0-5 inches bs), clay (6-48 inches bs), over clay with shale (49-80 inches bs) is the usual
profile. Steeper slopes are covered in Woodtell Fine Sandy Loam, 5 to 20 percent slope which has
a similar profile: fine sandy loam (0-6 inches bs) on clay (7-38 inches bs).
Pickton Fine Sand covers the surface in the uplands around the old Oak Grove Church. A
common soil profile is fine sand (0-48 inches bs) over sandy clay loam (49-80 inches bs).
Wolfpen Loamy Fine Sand is also common in the area. It is made up of loamy fine sand (0-25
inches bs) sitting on sandy clay loam (26-56 inches bs). In the vicinity of Gladewater, Duffen
Fine Sandy Loam soil series is present. A typical soil profile consists of fine sand (0-84 inches
bs). Kirvin Fine Sandy Loam is also present around Gladewater and is made up of very fine sandy
loam (0-14 inches bs), clay (15-42 inches bs), over shale lenses (43-72 inches bs).
Woodtell-Raino Complex soils are found in the north and south end of the project area
close to streams. These soils have a profile made up of loam (0-12 inches bs), clay (13-49 inches
bs), on top of shaly clay (50-60 inches bs). Bernaldo Fine Sandy Loam is present in the uplands
throughout the project area. A typical profile is fine sandy loam (0-17 inches bs) over sandy clay
loam (18-80 inches bs). Freestone Fine Sandy Loam is also found in numerous upland locations.
A profile consists of fine sandy loam (0-5 inches bs), loam (6-11 inches bs), clay loam (12-27
inches bs), clay (28-73 inches bs), over shale (83+ inches bs). Derly-Raino Complex is found in
the northern part of the project area near Midway. The soils form natural mounds are poorly
drained, and a profile is made up of silt loam (0-14 inches bs), silty clay loam (15-26 inches bs),
over clay (27-83 inches bs).
2.4 CULTURAL CONTEXT
Chronology
Archeological investigations have resulted in the construction of a temporal framework
or chronology for the region (Schumbach 1993; Johnson 1962; Thurmond 1990; Perttula 1992;
and Story, 1990). The framework is made up of the following prehistoric time periods and dates:
PaleoIndian (11,000-10,000 BP), Late PaleoIndian (10,000-9000 BP), Early PaleoIndian (9000­
6000 BP); Archaic (6000-2200 BP); Transitional times between the prehistoric and historic are
the Early Ceramic (2200 BP-A.D. 800), Formative (AD 800-1000), Early Caddoan (AD 1000­
1200), and Middle Caddoan (AD 1200-1400), and the Late Caddoan (AD 1400 to 1680). The
historic time period in the region is from AD 1680 to 1960.
Previous Cultural Resources Surveys
Previous investigations in the vicinity of the proposed ROW were conducted at the
TUMCO Monticello B-2 coal mine (PBSJ 1989; 1991). Large numbers of cultural resources were
recorded during surveys of the mine prospect areas, including Caddoan villages, short-term and
long-term prehistoric camp sites, historic nineteenth and twentieth century house sites and
standing historic buildings. (Glander and Bond 1986, 1989; Hoyt et al. 1994; Jones 1993).
Investigations of sites in the mine area were conducted to determine eligibility status and develop
and test predictive models to determine significant site locations (Skokan 1993; Kotter et al.
1993; and Nash et al 1995).

Previous Archeological Sites
Seven known archeological sites (41TT94, 41TT484, 41TT511, 41TT518, 41TT519,
41TT520, and 41TT521) were recorded related to mine activity are near the west side of the
FM1402 easement (Table 2). They fall 90-670 feet outside the ROW of FM1402. The existing
sites are more than 120 feet outside the fiber optic line APE and will not be affected by the new
construction.

Cultural Resources Survey

AT&T Fiber Optic Line 7734084

3.0 CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
3.1 INTRODUCTION
The objectives of the intensive cultural resources survey are twofold. The first is to locate any
known cultural resources present in the APE or the locations proposed for new construction. The second is
to identify any significant historic properties present that could be affected by the proposed activity. These
include, but are not restricted to, historic buildings built before 1959, cemeteries, and archeological sites.
The cultural resources survey was performed in accordance with, and at the rates specified in the Texas
Archeological Minimum Survey Standards, with modifications.
The intensive pedestrian survey covered the 9.28 mile long fiber optic line right-of-way (ROW)
on both the east and the west side of the road for a total of 18.56 miles. The fiber optic line APE is about
10 feet wide and is inside an existing TxDOT FM1402 ROW on the east side. The ROW from the edge to
the edge of the pavement measures 24 feet wide and contains buried utilities. Pedestrian inspection of 24
foot wide-easements on both sides of the road was carried out. Visual inspection of adjacent private
property 20-125 feet beyond the edge of the ROW was also performed from the ROW. Seven locations
adjacent to and/or within 250 feet of existing archeological sites were visited and any extant structures
were observed.
3.2 METHODS
Upon arrival in the field, it was found that trenching had already occurred in certain segments of
the proposed route. Another modification encountered in the field, was the location of the fiber optic line
installation. It was not on the west side as originally thought, but is located on the east side of the FM402
ROW. For this reason, the survey area was expanded. The ROWs on both sides of FM1402 have been
previously disturbed by the installation of fiber optic lines, water lines, telephone lines, and waste water
lines.
Due to conditions encountered, the minimum State Archeological Minimum Survey Standards
were modified. Two parallel transects were walked along both sides of the existing FM ROW by
technicians at 2-5 meter intervals apart. Technicians covered the APE and the FM1402 ROW. The rate of
survey was about 3 miles per person per day. Shovel testing was not performed while walking transects,
because surface visibility was more than 40 percent, trenches were open, and back dirt was available to
examine for artifacts. No artifacts or chert rock were observed in the FM ROWs and/or APE on the
ground surface.
No shovel testing was conducted at Hart Creek because the area has been previously inspected for
archeological sites and shovel tested with negative results. Shovel testing was implemented at the
remaining three creek locations with less than 40 percent surface visibility and where locations with deep
soils with the potential to contain buried archeological deposits might be present. Three creek crossings
were intensively surveyed by narrowing transects within 100 meters of each stream examined during the
survey. Controlled shovel tests were dug at arbitrary 20 cm levels and all soils were dry-screened through
¼ inch hardware cloth. No artifacts were recovered or collected.
Standing historic structures older than 50 years adjacent to the east side of the FM1402 ROW were
identified. Historic structures within 125 feet of the proposed ROW were photo-documented, as needed.
GPS data were also collected at each location. Existing sites and historic structures on the west side of the
road were not documented, because they are located outside the APE and the FM 1402 ROW.

4.0 RESULTS
4.1 INTRODUCTION
The results of the cultural resources survey of the AT&T Fiber Optic Line 7734084 were negative.
No new archeological or historical sites were found inside the APE and/or the FM1402 ROW. Profiles
observed in open trenches do not contain cultural strata. Shovel testing at three of the four creek crossing
locations were also negative. Outside the APE, however; thirteen cultural resource locales were observed
during the survey (Table 3). Seven previously recorded archeological site locations were viewed that are
on the west side of FM1402 to determine if the sites extended into the ROW and/or APE. Also observed
on the west side of FM1402 were an historic barn and two early to mid-twentieth century houses. Lastly,
three historic structures were observed on the east side of FM1402 outside the ROW and the fiber optic
line APE. None of the standing structures will be directly and/or indirectly impacted by the installation of
the fiber optic line.
4.2 ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES
The seven previously recorded archeological sites are located in the vicinity of the west side of the
FM1402 ROW. They consist of a prehistoric site (41TT94), historic house sites (41TT484, 41TT508,
41TT518) and historic structures (41TT519, 41TT520, and 41TT521). All of the seven known sites are
located on the west side of FM1402 more than 50 feet outside the FM 1402 ROW and more than 110 feet
from the AT&T fiber optic line APE. None of the locations will be affected by the proposed construction
and, therefore, no additional investigation is needed before construction commences. No existing sites are
present on the east side of FM1402, because it is outside the mine and has not been inspected by
archeologists.

4.3 HISTORIC BUILDINGS
Three historic buildings were encountered on the east side of FM1402 adjacent to the ROW where
construction is under way (Structures 4-6). Structure 4 is a frame bungalow style home built between the
1930s-1950s. Structure 5 is a 1940s-1960s clapboard cottage with asphalt shingle siding. Structure 4
(Figure 4) and Structure 5 (Figure 5) are not architecturally significant and are ineligible for listing in the
NRHP and/or as SAL.
Structure 6 is an early twentieth century (1910-1930s) Victorian-style house (Figure 6). It may be
architecturally significant, if it has not been altered. The house may be potentially eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP under Criterion C and/or as a SAL under Criterion (1) for historic structures. The building is
located 85 feet east APE and will not be directly and/or indirectly affected by installation of the below-the­
ground fiber optic line. Appendix II contains spatial data for historic building locations (Table 5).
4.4 SHOVEL TESTING
Shovel testing was implemented at Creek Crossing 2, 3, and 4. Six shovel tests total were dug by
hand and soils were dry-screened to determine artifact content. One shovel test was placed in the ROW on
the north and south side of creek crossings to depths of 40-50 cm below the surface (bs). The results were
negative, no artifacts were found. Creek Crossing 1 at Hart Creek was not shovel tested because it has
been previously cleared by archeologists and the THC.

4.5 TRENCH PROFILES
Segments of trenches were open showing subsurface soils, while others were closed and recently
backfilled. Soil profiles exposed in trench walls were described and photo-documented at nine locations
along the ROW. All trenches exposed a uniform profile of shallow sand over clay. Light brown to brown
to yellowish brown fine sand to a depth of 30 cm – 1 m deep over yellow to yellowish-brown clays to 1.2
meters deep (Figure 7). No artifacts or cultural zones were present. Back dirt and back fill were examined
for artifacts. Profiles were similar at all locations. The potential for deeply buried cultural deposits in the
lower clay strata is very low.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1DISCUSSION
The cultural resources survey of the AT&T Fiber Optic Line Survey contributed limited new data
about the cultural history of the Hart and Stinking Creek drainages, inter-stream terraces, and divides.
Findings showed that installation of the fiber optic line will not affect any significant archeological and/or
historic properties. Prehistoric activity was outside the upland areas studied, closer to major streams such
as Hart’s Branch and White Oak Creek. The seven previously known sites viewed on the west side of
FM1402 fall well outside the APE and will not be impacted.
5.2CONCLUSIONS
The east and west ROWs of FM1402 do not contain cultural resources and do not posses the
potential to contain buried deposits, as evidenced in open trenches. APC, therefore concludes that no
significant archeological and/or historical sites eligible for listing in the NRHP and/or as a SAL will be
affected by the proposed new construction. Based on negative findings, no additional cultural resources
work is needed before construction begins.
5.3RECOMMENDATIONS
Construction of the AT&T Fiber Optic Line 7734084 Project should proceed, as planned, without
additional cultural resources investigation. In closing, if during construction, unanticipated archeological
deposits are discovered by machinery, digging should stop at the location. The Archeology Division of the
THC should be notified by telephone at (512) 463-6096. The finds should be evaluated by an archeologist
in consultation with the THC, before digging resumes.
