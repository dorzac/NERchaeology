ABSTRACT
Timber Village Apartments II, Ltd. is proposing to construct a 72-unit
multifamily apartment community on a 6.3-acre tract located on the
northwest side of Marshall, Harrison County, Texas. The apartment
community will receive federal funding assistance from the Texas
Department of Housing and Community Affairs (TDHCA), so the project
must meet National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements.
Despite the excavation of 6 shovel tests and a 100 percent ground
visibility throughout the project area, no historic or prehistoric sites were
uncovered. In summary, it is AR Consultants, Inc.’s recommendation that
the apartment community be constructed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
Timber Village Apartments II, Ltd. is proposing to construct a 72-unit multifamily
apartment community on a 6.3-acre tract on the northwest side of Marshall, Harrison
County, Texas. The apartment community will receive federal funding assistance from
the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs (TDHCA), so the project must
meet National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements. Timber Village
Apartments II, Ltd contracted with AR Consultants, Inc to conduct an intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey. The Texas Historical Commission, in a letter dated
August 4, 2009, recommended a pedestrian survey supplemented with shovel testing of
the 6.3-acre tract. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the potential of
encountering significant historic or prehistoric archaeological sites if a decision is made
to construct the project. Previous investigations in the surrounding area have indicated
that there is a moderate potential for finding sites in this type of setting.
The parcel is bounded on the north by W. Loop 390N and on the west by Runnels Rd.
The southern boundary is a utility easement and transmission line corridor and the eastern
boundary is approximately 1300 feet west of Norwood St. The study area is located
within the Mixed Pine-Hardwood Forest vegetative community, which includes much of
East Texas. The Mixed Pine-Hardwood Forest in the Piney Woods of northeast Texas
(Diamond, Riskind, and Orzell 1987: Figure 1) is characterized as an oak-hickory-pine
forest. The underlying geology of the entire area is the Reklaw Formation, which is an
Eocene age formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1975). This formation is composed
of clay with some ironstone ledges and rubble. The Reklaw overlies the Carrizo Sand and
the undivided Wilcox Group. The closest Quaternary deposits are in the floodplain of the
Rainy Creek, which is approximately one mile west and in Grays Creek approximately
two miles to the northeast. The soils in the project area are gravelly fine sandy loamy
soils with loamy and clayey subsoils; all are included in the Kirvin soil association
(Golden, Peer, and Brown 1994: General Soil Map). The survey area is mapped as Kirvin
gravelly fine sandy loam with 2-5% slopes. The surface layer of this very medium acidic
dark brown gravelly fine sandy loam is about four inches thick. The subsoil is red sandy
clay with very strong acidity that extends to about 41 inches (Golden et al. 1994:48).
This report has been written in accordance with the report guidelines prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The report presents a brief description of the
natural environment of the study area. This is followed by a description of the research
design and the methodology used to carry it out. The results of the investigation follow
and constitute the body of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations that
arise from the study. A list of references cited concludes the report.

Research Design & Methodology
In order to plan the archaeological survey, the surveyors first reviewed the information
about the study area in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas. In addition, the 1936 and
1956 General Highway Maps of Harrison County as well as the 1962 and Photo-revised
1978 USGS topographic maps were examined for historic structures mapped in the study
area. None of the maps or records showed any structures within the boundaries of the
study area. The field team walked two parallel transects spaced 20 meters apart and made
notes about the ground exposure, surface artifacts, soil types and disturbed areas where
subsoil was exposed as recommended by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
(2002) and adopted by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Photographs were taken
through out the study area using a Canon PowerShot SD600 2.0 mega pixel digital
camera. Shovel tests were excavated areas of least disturbance and were the topsoil had
not been removed. Shovel tests were excavated to the sterile subsoil (CTA 2002). Shovel
tests averaged 30 cm in diameter. The compact clays from the shovel tests were manually
broken and inspected visually in order to determine if cultural materials were present.
Sandy soils from the shovel tests were screened through ¼” hardware cloth. Shovel test
matrices were described on the basis of texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart
was used to identify the specific soil colors in each test. The shovel test locations were
determined with a handheld Garmin GPSmap76 receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into three sections. First with a review of sites and
investigations recorded near or within the 6.3 tract. This is followed with the description
of the tract followed by the survey results. Shovel tests will be described briefly within
the text and are detailed in Table 1. The conclusions end the chapter.
Records Review
A search of Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) indicates that very few
archaeological surveys have been conducted near to the study area. It further indicates
that only two archaeological sites have been recorded within a 1 mile radius of the study
area. The first site, 41HS17, is the Marshall Powder Mill site, which is a National
Register of Historic Places (NHRP) property. The site is approximately 1.5 miles north of
Marshall. Excavations were conducted at this site in 1972 and at the end of 1973 through
the summer of 1974 (Weir 1973; Luke 1978). The site consists of a Civil War era,
Confederate manufacturing of small arms and a powder mill with shops for blacksmiths
and carpenters. Additionally, approximately 275 meter southeast of the 41HS17 is a
prehistoric site, 41HS33, which sits atop a hill. Several Archaic points, manos and
matates, bifaces and unifacial tools were recovered from the site (TASA 2009).
The nearest linear archaeological surveys conducted near the study area was in 1975 and
1995 for the Federal Highway Authority (FHWA) and for the Texas Department of
Highway and Public Transportation (TDHPT) (TASA 2009). It examined sections of SH
154 and no archaeological sites were recorded as a result of these surveys. Additionally,
in 2000 and 2002, ARC conducted three separate surveys around Marshall. The first two
were small block studies, one for an antenna site and the other for well pad (Kent and
Skinner 2000; Skinner 2000). Neither of these surveys recorded any archaeological sites.
The other survey was conducted was for the SH 449 Borrow Pit and recorded two
prehistoric lithic scatters, but no historic sites (Skinner 2002). Neither site recorded
contained any site integrity nor were further studies recommended. A review of historic
maps available showed no structures within or adjacent to the project area.
Survey Area
The terrain was gently rolling and sloped from the north to the south and had recently
been cleared of most vegetation providing 100 percent ground visibility for 60 percent of
the study area (Figure 2). The vegetation in the project area consisted of a few oaks,
pines, bois d’arcs, greenbriar and poison ivy. The places where vegetation had been
removed exposed the subsoil throughout the project area. In addition to the removal of
vegetation there are several buried utility lines in and around the project area. The closest
water source is an unnamed intermittent tributary that is 500 feet to the east.

Survey Results
Given the 100 percent ground visibility provided by the recent clearing a total of 6 shovel
tests were excavated to the sterile subsoil spaced throughout the 6.3 acres (Figure 3). The
entire 6.3 acres were walked by the field crew in two transects to inspect the surface
exposure for any cultural materials. A large pile of modern debris was found near the
entrance to the project area and Loop 390. This trash dump consisted a modern couch,
roofing shingles and a variety of other modern debris. All 6 of the shovel tests were
placed in areas of least disturbance, where vegetation had not been removed. All
contained a similar A horizon of yellowish brown to dark grayish brown very fine sandy
soils with gravels on top of a yellowish red compact clay subsoil. The A horizon ranged
from 5 to 45cm in thickness. The subsoil was reached between 5 and 49cm below the
ground surface. The gravels ranged from pea to golf ball size and were all sandstone, no
quartzite or chert gravels were noted in the project area nor were they expected to be
found. All of the shovel tests were negative for cultural materials.

Conclusions
During the survey, no prehistoric or historic cultural materials were observed on the
surface or in the 6 shovel tests. The surrounding area has been occupied historically, yet
no structures were mapped on any of the historic maps reviewed. This small acreage was
likely part of a larger land grant and occupation of this property did not occur in this
small area.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the negative results of the pedestrian survey, AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that the Timber Village Apartments II be allowed to proceed. If cultural
resources are encountered during construction, work should immediately cease in that
area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
Work should not continue until discussions with the proper agency have been concluded.
