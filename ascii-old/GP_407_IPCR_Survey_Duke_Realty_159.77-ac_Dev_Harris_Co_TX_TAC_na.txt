ABSTRACT

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), of Houston, Texas, performed an
intensive pedestrian survey on a total of approximately 64.65 hectares (159.77 acres) of
property in Harris County, Texas. The property is associated with the Duke Realty
development project.
The Lead Federal Agency for the project is the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, Galveston District (USACE). The goals of the cultural resources survey were to
determine if land altering activities required to complete this project would affect any
previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to establish whether or not
previously unidentified cultural resources were located within the project’s area of potential
effect (Advisory Council on Historic Preservation [ACHP] 1999).
The majority of the surveyed area was vegetated with immature secondary growth.
The majority of the surveyed area has been overlain with a substantial amount of fill. Major
disturbances within the project area included the presence of extant modern buildings, paved
parking lots, ongoing construction that is unrelated to the current undertaking, and previous
drainage excavation.
As a result of the investigation, a total of 32 shovel tests and 11 backhoe trenches
were excavated within the project area. No new or previously identified archaeological sites
or historic standing structures were recorded during the investigation. Based on the negative
results of the intensive pedestrian survey, HRA Gray & Pape recommends no further work
and that the project be allowed to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), of Houston, Texas, performed an
intensive pedestrian survey on a total of approximately 64.65 hectares (159.77 acres) of
property in Harris County, Texas. The property is associated with the Duke Realty
development project. The Lead Federal Agency for the project is the United States Army
Corps of Engineers, Galveston District (USACE). The survey was conducted entirely on
privately owned property. Therefore, a Texas Antiquities Permit was not required. The
archaeological Area of Potential Effect (APE) is defined as all 60 hectares (147 acres) of
property associated with the project.
The goals of the cultural resources survey were to determine if land altering activities
required to complete this project would affect any previously identified historic properties as
defined by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended (36 CFR 800), and to establish whether or not previously unidentified cultural
resources were located within the project’s area of potential effect (Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation [ACHP] 1999).

PROJECT AREA
The surveyed area is located on the La Porte United States Geological Survey
(USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map in Harris County, Texas (see Figure 1). The
surveyed area consists primarily of low-lying topography that has been overlain with fill.
Major disturbances within the project area included the presence of extant modern buildings,
paved parking lots, ongoing construction that is unrelated to the current undertaking, and
previous drainage excavation. The project area is bound on the north by West Fairmont
Parkway, on the west by Underwood Road, on the east by Big Island Slough, and on the
south by industrial facilities.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Crew Chiefs Kerry McGuire and Charlie Bludau led the field effort with support from
Technicians Elizabeth Spalding and Jessica Campbell. Fieldwork was conducted in late
October of 2007 and required approximately 60 person hours to complete. Principal
Investigator Kristi Soltysiak completed site file research prior to fieldwork mobilization.
James Hughey acted as Project Manager. Tony Scott and Julia Balakirova produced
graphics. Kristi Soltysiak prepared the content of the report. The report was edited and

SOILS
The survey area contains soils consisting primarily of Beaumont clay (Ba) with a
small percentage of Bernard-Edna complex soils (Be) and Lake Charles clays (LcA). The
Beaumont clays are found in the central and southern portion of the project area and the
Bernard-Edna complex and Lake Charles clays are located along the northern edge of the
proposed project area.
Beaumont clay (Ba) is a poorly drained soil found along the coastal prairie (Wheeler
1976). The surface layer is dark gray clay about 53 centimeters (21 inches) thick. Below
this is a layer of gray clay about 97 centimeters (38 inches) thick. This layer is followed by
grayish brown clay with light olive brown and strong brown mottles to a depth of about 185
centimeters (73 inches). These soils possess low potential for archaeological remains (Abbot
2001: 22).
Bernard-Edna complex (Be) is a mix of mainly Bernard clay loam and Edna fine sand
(Wheeler 1976). The Bernard soil is found in flat and depressed areas while the Edna soil is
found on ridges, knolls and pimple mounds. The surface layer of the Bernard clay loam is
very dark gray clay loam about 15 centimeters (6 inches) thick Below this is a layer about
122 centimeters (48 inches) thick with the upper portion being very dark gray clay and the
lower portion being dark gray clay. This layer is followed by gray clay with yellowish
brown mottles and calcium carbonate concretions. The surface layer of the Edna soil is dark
grayish brown fine sandy loam about 25 centimeters (10 inches) thick. Below this is an 86centimeter (34-inch) thick layer of clay with the upper portion being gray and the lower
portion being olive gray. This layer is followed by gray sandy clay loam with yellowish
brown mottles. These soils possess a low potential for archaeological remains (Abbott
2001:22, 23).
Lake Charles clay (LcA) is considered a somewhat poorly drained soil (Wheeler
1976). The surface layer is black clay about 91 centimeters (36 inches) thick with the upper
portion being black and the lower portion very dark gray. Below this is a layer of dark gray
clay about 41 centimeters (16 inches) thick followed by gray clay with olive brown and
yellowish brown mottles for another 56 centimeters (22 inches). These soils possess low
potential for archaeological remains (Abbott 2001: 22).

CULTURE HISTORY AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The oldest prehistoric sites in Harris County can be found around Clear Lake, and
date to approximately 4,000 B.C. placing them in the latter part of the Early Archaic.
Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal Plain tend
to be composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits reflecting short-term occupation episodes.
In general, these sites consist of temporally non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin subsurface
3

deposits, or suggest the presence of multiple cultural components within a mixed
stratigraphic archaeological context.
The primary problem facing researchers working on prehistoric sites in this region
stems from a dearth of cleanly stratified deposits. Environmental conditions leading to slow
soil development combined with rapid urbanization in many areas of southeast Texas have
complicated the already difficult task of reconstructing cultural traditions and developing
chronologies associated with the highly mobile lifeways of the prehistoric hunter-gatherer
populations formerly inhabiting this area.
The majority of larger inland sites consist of sandy middens with high lithic material
counts and moderate amounts of pottery located near water sources. These sites are
generally considered base camps and there is a notable absence of satellite activity areas.
Within the base camps distinct activity loci are present (Patterson 1995). Historic sites near
the project area typically consist of farm- or homesteads dating to the late nineteenth or early
twentieth centuries.
Two archaeological surveys have been conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1 mile)
study radius of the project area (see Figure 1). The Galveston USACE district led a pipeline
survey effort in 1979 and Moore Archaeological Consultants (MAC), Inc. conducted another
linear survey south of the current project location. Both surveys did not result in the
identification of any new cultural resources.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Site file research was initiated by reviewing records maintained by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, and by consulting on-line
research archives maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Research was
conducted within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) study radius of the project area to identify all
previously recorded archaeological sites, historical markers and historic structures eligible
for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listing. Site file research was used to
provide a historic context to the archaeological survey.
In addition, because the project area was devoid of established vegetation, it was
apparent that the area had been cleared in the past. Therefore, an examination of old
topographic quadrangle maps dating from as recent as 1995 to as old as 1915 and aerial
photographs dating between 2005 and 1944 were examined to determine whether any
previous historic-age structures may have been previously present within the project area.
The archaeological investigations associated with the current undertaking were
designed to identify and record the existence of cultural resources, prehistoric and historic,
within the defined project boundaries. The entire 64.65 hectares (159.77 acres) tract was
subjected to intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey. Archaeological investigations
included a combination of surface (pedestrian survey) and subsurface (shovel testing) and
mechanical deep testing methods.

The project area was divided into two survey areas (Survey Area A and Survey Area
B). Both areas were surveyed along a series of transects spaced 30 meters (100 feet) apart.
Transects in Survey Area A were surveyed on a north-south axis using West Fairmont
Parkway as a fixed landmark for reference. Transects in Survey Area B were surveyed on an
east-west axis using Underwood Road as a fixed landmark reference.
Texas minimum survey standards call for one shovel test every 1.2 hectares (3 acres) in
project between 40 and 80 hectares (100 and 200 acres) in size. For this survey, a total of 59
shovel tests were planned for excavation. Transects were placed 30 meters (100 feet) apart.
Shovel tested transects were spaced 100 meters (300 feet) apart. Two pedestrian surveyed
transects were walked over between the shovel tested transects and the ground surface was
examined for exposed artifacts. On the shovel tested transects, a 100-meter (300-foot)
interval was used between each shovel test. Shovel tests were not excavated in areas of
standing water or in areas with saturated soils.
Excavated shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (12 inches) in diameter and were
typically excavated to a maximum depth ranging between 20 and 50 centimeters (8 and 27.50
inches) into the underlying substratum, or until culturally sterile subsoil was encountered.
Removed soils were screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth.
Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard terminology and soil color charts.
Additional information concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized shovel test
forms for each excavation.
During shovel testing, it was determined that up to one meter (3 feet) of fill was
overlying the natural ground surface across the majority of the project area. In an effort to
locate the natural ground surface and to explore for buried archaeological sites, the project
area was subjected to mechanical deep testing. Mechanical deep testing was conducted using
a rubber-tired backhoe with a smooth-edged bucket.
All deep tests, referred to as backhoe trenches (BHTs) were oriented in a west to east
fashion and measured approximately five meters (16 feet) in length, one meter (three feet) in
width, and two meters (six feet) in depth. The southern or northern wall of each BHT was
profiled and inspected for exposed cultural features and/or artifacts. Photographs of each
BHT profiled wall were captured. Representative photographs of the project area are
provided in Plates 1-4 below.

RESULTS
Site file research resulted in no previously identified archaeological sites or historical
markers within 1.6 kilometers (1-mile) of the project area. An examination of historic
topographic maps and aerial photographs did not result in the identification of any historic

age structures that may have been present within the project area prior to mechanical
clearing. The majority of the project area is covered with short secondary scrub and shrub
foliage (see Plate 1), although the southeastern portion of Survey Area B is comprised of a
substantial amount of inundated ground surface and wetland vegetation (see Plate 2). Portions
of the project area are highly disturbed (see Plate 3) and have been previously developed.
As a result of the archaeological investigation, a total of 14 shovel tests were
excavated in Survey Area A. An additional 14 shovel tests were attempted, but surface
disturbances such as spoil pile mounds and inundation precluded their excavation. A total of
19 shovel tests were excavated in Survey Area B (see Figure 2). An additional 13 shovel
tests were planned in this area, but their excavation was prohibited by inundation and
previous construction noted by the presence of a paved parking lot and ongoing construction
activities unrelated to the current undertaking (see Figure 2). All 32 successfully excavated
shovel tests were negative for cultural resources. It was thought that the majority of the soils
excavated during shovel testing consisted of fill material below the reach of a shovel, but this
could not be verified until the area was mechanically trenched. Descriptions of all shovel test
profiles are provided in Appendix A.
To verify the presence of thick fill, a total of 11 BHTs were excavated using a rubbertired backhoe with a smooth-edged “clean-up” bucket (see Figure 2). Seven BHTs (BHTs 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) were excavated in Survey Area A and four BHTs (8, 9, 10, and 11) were
excavated in Survey Area B. All BHTs were excavated in a west-east fashion. The northern
or southern wall was profiled and photographed. As a result of the trenching, the natural
ground surface was located below a minimum of 10 centimeters (4 inches) of fill and a
maximum of 175 centimeters (69 inches) of fill (see Plate 4). All eleven BHTs were
negative for cultural resources. Descriptions of all BHT profiles are provided in Appendix B.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey
conducted on 64.65 hectares (159.77 acres) of property associated with the Duke Realty
development project in Harris County, Texas. Initial investigation consisted of a background
literature and site file search to identify the presence of recorded sites in close proximity to
the current proposed project. No previously recorded sites, historical markers or structures
were identified within a 1.6-kilometer (1 mile) study radius of the project area.
Previously recorded archaeological sites or historic structures were not identified
within the surveyed area. Field investigation consisted of pedestrian survey, shovel testing,
and mechanical deep testing within the project area. Subsurface investigation included the
excavation of a total of 32 shovel tests and 11 BHTs within the project APE.

The majority of the project area has been overlain by a substantial amount of fill.
This fill was identified as a result of shovel testing and mechanical deep testing during the
survey. Additional disturbances included the presence of extant modern buildings, a paved
parking lot, and ongoing construction unrelated to the current undertaking.
The results of the intensive pedestrian survey indicate that no previously unidentified
cultural resources are located within the surveyed area and no newly identified
archaeological sites of historic structures were recorded. Based on these results, HRA Gray
& Pape recommends no further work and that the project be allowed to proceed as planned.
