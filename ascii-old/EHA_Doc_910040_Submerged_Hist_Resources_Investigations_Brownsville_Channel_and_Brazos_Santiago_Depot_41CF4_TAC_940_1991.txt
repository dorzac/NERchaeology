The following historic account of Brazos Santiago has been partially adapted from a
previous EH&A publication (EH&A 1990a). A majority of the information reported below,
however, is new material that has been gleaned from primary sources. Following the completion
of field work on the current project, EH&A conducted extensive research at the National Archives
in Washington, D.C. A large number of original maps and letters pertaining to Brazos Santiago
were examined and copied. Many of these maps have been reproduced in this report. Nearly all
of the letters examined at the archives have been transcribed and are reproduced at the end of this
report as Appendix A Photostatic copies of these materials are on file at EH&A's office in
Austin, Texas.
Brazos Santiago Pass was first documented by the Spaniard, Alonso Alvarez de Pineda,
in 1519 (Alperin 1977:137). Pineda had been sent on an expedition by Francisco de Garay,
Governor of Jamaica and a companion of Columbus on his second voyage to America. Pineda's
expedition, consisting of four ships, set out to explore and map the lands bordering the Gulf of
Mexico. Some researchers credit him with naming the pass, Brazos de San Iago, meaning the
Arms of Saint James (McKenna 1956:5), although Alperin (1977:137) credits a later explorer,
Diego de Camargo, with christening the pass. In either event, the name is one of the few in the
area given by the earliest Spanish explorers to remain virtually unchanged.
Pineda continued southward from Brazos Island and spent 40 days at the mouth of
a large river which he called Rio de las Palmas. Upon Pineda's advice, Garay decided to begin
colonization of the territory at the mouth of this river in 1520. Whether or not this was the Rio
Grande is disputed by historians. Several Spanish maps of the period indicate that the Rio de las
Palmas may have been located south of the Rio Grande. Garay sent Diego de Camargo to the
mouth of the Rio de las Palmas to build a permanent settlement; however, this attempt met with
disaster when the Spanish angered Indians in the area. Cortez apparently learned of Camargo's
settlement when Camargo fled to Vera Cruz. He referred to the river in a letter to the King of
Spain, dated 26 September 1526. "I have a goodly number of people ready to go to settle at the
Rio de las Palmas. I have been informed that it is good land and that there is a p0rt" (Ferguson
1976:14; Webb 1952,1:274). Cortez never pursued an exploration of the area, although several
others made unsuccessful attempts until about 1535. Political in-fighting, combined with Indian
attacks, curtailed further Spanish colonization efforts in the area for more than 200 years (Zavaleta
1986:131).
Between 1535 and 1746, the lack of established Spanish settlements in the vicinity of
the south Texas coast encouraged French and Anglo interest in the area (Zavaleta 1986:132). The
Spanish, while not maintaining a permanent presence on this part of the coast, nevertheless, sought
to ensure that others did not successfully challenge their sovereignty. Rumors of a Dutch presence
at the mouth of the Rio Grande prompted a Spanish military expedition to the area in 1638
(Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1954:21 and Ruecking 1955:55, both cited in Gearhart and Moore
1987:II-9). In 1685, Alonso de Leon led another expedition through present-day Cameron County
in search of the French fort, Fort Saint Louis, located near Lavaca Bay (Stambaugh and Stambaugh
1954:23 and Webb 1952, 1:483, both cited in Gearhart and Moore 1987:11-9.; Banks 1983:11).

The Spanish crown eventually turned its attention to the area it had neglected while
living off the riches of its colonies to the south. Prompted by renewed fears of intrusion by French
colonists from Louisiana and murmurs of Indian uprisings, the King of Spain appointed Jose de
Escandon, on 3 September 1746, to undertake the colonization of Nuevo Santander which included
the Lower Rio Grande Valley (Pierce 1917:17). In 1747, the newly appointed lieutenant of the
viceroy of Seno Mexicano departed on a survey expedition that would lead him to the Rio Grande.
Information gathered from his own exploration, added to that of several other parties under his
direction, provided for the first successful colonization in that part of New Spain (Pierce 1917:17).
Escandon left Queretaro (1,050 km south of Brownsville) on 16November1748 with
755 soldiers and 2,515 colonists destined for the northern frontier (Pierce 1917:17). Within eight
years he had established more than 20 towns and 15 missions (Figure 8). The nature and intent
of Escandon's colonization efforts contrasted sharply with the classic Spanish settlement pattern
of mission and fortress. He insisted that the soldiers who accompanied him lay aside their arms,
once the initial safety of the community had been secured, and turn their attention to farming and
ranching (Zavaleta 1986:132). The northernmost settlements established by Escandon were
situated along the Rio Grande, including Camargo, Dolores, Mier, Laredo, Revilla and Reynosa
(Figure 8; Zavaleta 1986:132). None of his settlements were located near the modern Texas coast.
The closest was Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de Reynos (modern Reynosa), located on the south
bank of the Rio Grande about 130 km from its mouth.
Escandon believed the coastal plain to be unsuitable for human habitation. He
believed the delta area was malarial and that settlements situated farther up the river, where the
climate was drier, were healthier. Nevertheless, as early as 1765, a tiny congregation from the
ranches of Reynosa and Camargo had established a village of semi-permanent dwellings closer to
the mouth of the Rio Grande. First called San Juan de los Esteros Hermosos (Saint John of the
Beautiful Lakes), the cluster of lean-tos and jacales (mud and thatch huts) was renamed when
missionaries arrived in 1797 to formalize the community into a mission. The village was then
called Congregacion de Nuestra Senora de! Refugio de los Esteros (Congregation of our Lady of
Refuge of the Lakes), and shortened to Refugio (Zavaleta 1986:134). It again would be renamed
as ·Matamoros with the Mexican War of Independence, to commemorate the martyred priest,
Mariano Matamoros (Pierce 1917:20). Despite Escandon's early reservations, other communities
sprang up on or near the coast during this same period. The village of Fronton (modem Port
Isabel) was established during the 1770s (Webb 1952, 11:388, cited in Gearhart and Moore
1987:II-11). In A Brief History of the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Pierce (1917:143) stated that as
early as 1788 a village was also in existence at Brazos de Santiago. Both Fronton and Brazos
Santiago apparently served primarily as summer resorts prior to 1800. Although Pierce does not
state the source of his information, this is the earliest reference known to the authors for any type
of settlement at Braws Santiago. Certainly with the establishment of Fronton in the 1770s,
however, vessel traffic must have picked up through the pass at Braws Santiago, even if only
fishing vessels.
The Port of Brazos Santiago
Prior to Mexican independence' in 1821, the pass and harbor of Braws Santiago saw
only a small amount of shipping. The harbor was first opened to foreign trade in 1823 when
ranchero Martin de Leon brought luxury merchandise from New Orleans to Braws Santiago

Ships carrying dry goods unloaded their cargo at the wharves of Brazos Santiago where
it was then transported overland to Matamoros. The goods destined for foreign ports were loaded
onto oxcarts or mules in Matamoros for the return trip to Brazos (Alperin 1977:139; Ferguson
1976:35). Brazos Santiago quickly became the principal Mexican port north of Vera Cruz, with
Matamoros serving as the center of commerce.
Mexico recognized the importance of the port and the trade that began to pour into
the interior from its northern frontier. Tom Lea, in The King Ranch, went so far as to say that
retention of the port was the motivating factor behind Mexico's war with the United States during
the 1840s.
As the Rio Grande Valley began to flourish, it drew the attention of foreign
speculators, especially those from the north. Tamaulipas, as a sovereign state, exercised control
over its own vacant lands and, between 1828 and 1836, allotted vacant lands lying between the
Nueces River and the Rio Grande to prominent Mexican citizens and soldiers (Pierce 1917:21);
however, it did not prohibit foreigners from moving into the territories. By 1836, Matamoros had
become a thriving center of commerce and boasted an international community with a number of
merchants from France and New England (Ferguson 1976:35). Municipal court records at that
time reveal an influx of "foreign" names heretofore unknown in the predominantly Spanish
outposts (Canseco 1981:21).

I

I

(Alperin 1977:139). In that same year, the town of Matamoros was granted status as a port of
entry by the Mexican government. With the establishment of a sea port at Braws Santiago and
a port of entry in the same year at Matamoros on the Rio Grande, a commercial bond was forged
between the two points. Brazos Santiago Pass has been, and still is, the only natural deepwater
pass allowing ocean-going ships access to the interior of the south Texas mainland (Clark 1971).
The mouth of the Rio Grande was extremely shallow, with shifting sand bars and poor anchorage,
but the harbor at Brazos Santiago, only 12 km north of the mouth, offered convenient anchorage
to ocean-going vessels.

i

One of those foreigners, Captain Henry Austin, a cousin of Stephen F. Austin, saw
a commercial opportunity in streamlining the delivery process of goods from Brazos Santiago to
Matamoros. In 1829 he brought his steamship Ariel up the Rio Grande to Matamoros. He
planned to carry cargoes, deposited by ocean-going vessels at Brazos Santiago, by steamboat to
Matamoros and other towns along the river, eliminating the arduous and time-consuming overland
conveyance of merchandise from Brazos Island. Austin's steamship hauled merchandise regularly
between Matamoros and Camargo and ventured as far up the river as Mier and Revilla (Horgan
1984:481; Webb 1952,1:67). By 1831, however, he abandoned the project and removed his boat
to the Brazos River. Despite Austin's failure, others later improved upon the scheme and created
a very lucrative riverboat enterprise. Charles Stillman, who later financed Richard King and
Mifflin Kenedy's riverboat company, had already established a mercantile business in Matamoros
by February 1828, a year prior to Austin's experiments with steamboat navigation on the river. It
is not unreasonable to suggest that he may have been inspired by Austin's efforts. "Foreign"
businessmen like Stillman, Kenedy and King would soon play important roles in the economic
development of the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

By 1830, Mexico had begun to doubt the wisdom of allowing so many foreigners to
settle on the frontier. Frank Pierce stated that • ... the policy of Mexico towards the colonists was
one of oppression to which the Americans would not submit" (Pierce 1917:21), but in truth, the
"Texians" refused to live by the covenants to which they had originally agreed. They did not adhere
to the laws and customs of Mexico; they did not become Catholics; and they did not give up the
institution of slavery that the Mexicans, so recently "enslaved" to the Spanish, abhorred. And they
were "not" doing these things in alarmingly increasing numbers. Between 1823 and 1836, the
Austin family and other promoters had succeeded in encouraging more than 20,000 AngloArnericans to immigrate to Texas. The ratio of English- to Spanish-speaking Texans north of the
Nueces River was 10:1, favoring English by the time of Texas independence from Mexico in 1836
(Zavaleta 1986:136).
Apprehension of the growing Anglo-American population of Texas led to the
institution of stricter laws for the Texans in the early 1830s. The Mexican General at Matamoros
recommended sending more ethnic (Mexican) colonists into Texas and increasing the number of
Mexican troops in the area in an attempt to establish a larger Mexican presence (Zavaleta
1986:136). Such recommendations did little except to anger the Texans, and the new laws aimed
at restricting Texan commerce and abolishing slavery were seen by the North Americans as direct
attacks on their livelihoods. It should have come as no surprise when the Texans declared their
independence and went to war against Mexico in 1832.

For the most part, the Texans' fight for independence did not greatly affect life in the
Lower Rio Grande, but several naval encounters of note occurred at Braros Santiago. In 1835,
an American schooner, Invincible, was confronted by a Mexican sloop-of-war, General Bravo, and
resulted in the death of an American officer. Two years later, a small battle ensued between an
American man-of-war and the Bravo over the detention of two American schooners in Braros
Santiago harbor (Pierce 1917:22-23). The result of the skirmishes was a demand by Mexico that
ships flying American flags in Texan waters be detained. It was a harbinger of future tensions
between the two nations once Texas gained its independence.
During the spring of 1837, a Texan named Reuben Potter spent from two to three
weeks on Braros Island. Potter had been a resident of Matamoros for several years prior to that
time. He presumably moved there during the 1820s when immigrants were pouring into Texas.
In 1850 he made a sworn statement to the U.S. government describing the Mexican facilities on
the island during his stay there (Appendix A, Letter 15). From Potter's statements it can be
concluded that there was a Mexican village on the north end of Braros Island, in the same location
as the later U.S. military depot (during and following the Mexican-American War).
With the likely exception of brief interruptions due to hurricanes, it seems likely that
Braws Island was inhabited continuously from 1788 through 1837 when Potter visited the site.
Pierce (1917:143) reported a resort village there as early as 1788, and by at least 1823, when
Matamoros became an official port of entry, Brazos Santiago was used as a port. From 1829 to
1831, Austin's steamboat Arie/ was transhipping merchandise through the harbor at Braws Santiago
for delivery to and from points along the Rio Grande. During the "latter portion" of Potter's
residence in Matamoros, "the landing of Braro de Santiago at the northern end of Braros Island
was a Mexican Military Post." During the summer of 1836, while Santa Ana was fighting in Texas,
the Mexicans built a gun battery at this post. "The battery was planted on the northern or

terminating point of the sand hills which was then near the Brazo Inlet, and commanded the
entrance to the harbor, as well as the village... The work consisted of a timber platform on which
several guns were mounted with a magazine continuous.• Potter was of the opinion that this was
"intended for a permanent military post when it was constructed" (Appendix A, Letter 15).

Potter also reported that a "Revenue Station, connected with the Custom House of
Matamoros, had been kept up at Brazo de Santiago and buildings there were at different times
occupied for Revenue purposes ..." The revenue station at Brazos Island was apparently destroyed
by a hurricane in October 1837, only months after Potter's visit to the island (Coast Depot and
Shipping Port 1850:7). Potter did not mention this storm but stated that the military post was
destroyed by "inundation" in 1844. Following the August 1844 hurricane, the Mexican government
ordered its officers to Point Isabel, and Brazos was abandoned (Coast Depot and Shipping Port
1850:7).
In the years between the Texan War of Independence and the Mexican War, attention
came to be focused on the area between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande. The leaders of
the Republic of Texas sent Texas regulars, militia and the Texas Rangers into the territory below
the Nueces, in part to establish a "buffer zone" between Mexico and the settlers in central Texas
(Zavaleta 1986:138) but also to secure the harbor at Point Isabel (McKenna 1956:10). Although
it had never acknowledged Texan Independence, the Mexican Government hoped, at the least, to
establish a boundary at the Nueces River (Zavaleta 1986:138). The southern boundary of Texas
continued to be a point of contention throughout the years of the Republic and was not resolved
until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican War (Pierce 1917:155).
The Mexican War
From the first, many leaders of the new Republic felt that Texas' best interest would
be served by petitioning the United States for annexation and they actively sought that end. When
annexation was affected in December 1845, the Mexican government repudiated the act and
returned the passport to the American charge de affairs. In fact, Mexico never acknowledged
Texan independence and insisted that the area between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River still
remained part of Nuevo Santander (Pierce 1917:22), a subtle point, but provocative nonetheless.
President James K. Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor to Corpus Christi Bay in anticipation of
hostilities on the Rio Grande, the disputed boundary between the two nations (Zavaleta 1986:138).

I

L~

In January 1846, Mexico broke off diplomatic relations with the United States. After
spending six months at Corpus Christi, General Taylor received a War Department Dispatch on
4 February 1846 which read, in part, that the general "ought to take up a position on or near the
Rio Grande as soon as possible" (Nichols 1963:42). Taylor was glad to leave Kinney's Ranch at
Corpus Christi, where his troops had become complacent and less than disciplined. He set out on
the 290-km journey south on 8 March 1846 with 3,554 men, heading toward his new base at Point
Isabel (Nichols 1963:44). Factors that led to Taylor's decision to make his base at Point Isabel
were: 1) its port which would facilitate transportation of supplies, 2) its protected site inside Padre
Island, and 3) its location only nine miles above the mouth of the Rio Grande. A contemporary
source described the decision and Point Isabel: "Point Isabel, an insignificant post, with a few mean
houses, had been selected as a depot for military stores, being the nearest port to Matamoras [sic]
on the north" (Fry 1848:88).

On 24 March 1846, 29 km north of Matamoros, Taylor and his cavalry broke off from
the main army to meet the cutter Woodbury and other boats enroute to Brazos Santiago with his
supplies and munitions. General Worth and the infantry turned west toward Matamoros (Banks
1983:14; Pierce 1917:26-27). As Taylor approached the point, he was met by a delegation of
Mexican citizens who petitioned him not to proceed. During the meeting, flames and smoke were
seen rising from the village of Fron ton at Point Isabel. Taylor immediately broke off the discussion
and rushed to Fronton where fleeing Mexican residents had set fire to the customs house and
other buildings (Nichols 1963:49). Taylor recalled the event in his first letter from Point Isabel
dated 25 March 1846. He said that while he was reading the letter of protest from the Fronton
deputation, ".. .it was discovered that the village of Frontone [sic] had been set on fire and
abandoned. I viewed this as a direct act of war" (Fry 1848:102). It is noteworthy that the letter's
inside address read, for the first time, "Headquarters, Army of Occupation."
The war with Mexico lasted from March 1846 until February 1848. Both Point Isabel
and Braws Santiago were utilized by General Taylor and his troops during the war. Existing
Mexican structures were utilized when possible; however, the burning of Fronton (Point Isabel)
and the destruction of buildings on Braws Island by the 1844 hurricane forced Taylor to build most
of the structures required for carrying on the business of war. Thomas Thorpe, one of Taylor's
officers, described the Mexican village of Fronton as "composed of grass-thatched cottages, made
of reeds, or spars of wrecked vessels ..." (quoted in Banks 1983:14-15). Presumably the pre-1844
village.at Braws Santiago had been of similar construction.
Taylor named his encampment at Point Isabel, "Fort Polk" after the U.S. President.
Fort Polk was dependent upon the harbor at Braws Santiago Pass for delivery of supplies.
Immediately upon the arrival of the detachments of the U.S. troops,
Point Isabel became a place of great business. The few Mexican huts
that were left standing after the fire, were at once occupied; and then
commenced the erection of a variety of rude sheds and dwellings, for the
accomodation [sic] of the "military stores" and the property of the sutlers
who followed the army. The harbor [at Braws Santiago] was filled with
vessels laden with the stores of the army, and of every possible size, that
could enter it ... (Thomas Thorpe quoted in Banks 1983:14-15).

Soon after his arrival, Taylor established a supply depot at Brazos Santiago replete with a
"quartermaster's office and store room, a large dwelling, with four rooms and kitchen, small
dwelling with two rooms and kitchen, and stables with ten stalls and four store rooms" (Crimmins
1950:204). Supplies destined for Fort Polk first entered the harbor at Braws Santiago where they
were transferred to shallow-draft vessels and lightered to Point Isabel or to the Rio Grande. The
bar outside of Braws Santiago Pass would admit vessels drawing up to 7-1{2 feet (ft) of water;
however, vessels drawing more than 3-1{2 ft could not reach Point Isabel across the Laguna Madre.
The bar across the mouth of the Rio Grande was generally 4 ft deep or less.
Once work began on the supply depot and base of operations, Taylor left Point Isabel
garrisoned with 450 men, met up with General Worth and continued toward the Rio Grande. The
army arrived at a place north of the river, across from Matamoros, on 28 March 1846 and set up
camp (Pierce 1917:27; Banks 1983:15). Army Engineer Mansfield immediately began to survey the

field, and on 4 April, construction of a fort began (Nichols 1963:58). Originally called Fort Taylor,
it was later named Fort Brown in honor of Major Jacob Brown who Jost his life defending the
position.

As negotiations with Mexico grew more heated, other temporary camps were
established along the Rio Grande between Fort Brown and the mouth of the river (Champion,
n.d.). One of these was Camp Belknap, named for Colonel William Belknap who first hoisted the
American flag at Fort Brown and later led his brigade in the charge against the Mexican army at
Resaca de la Palma (Webb 1952,1:140). Although very little is known about Camp Belknap, it is
shown to have been on Loma de la Estrella on a map drawn by Lieutenant J.D. Webster in 1847
(Figure 9). When intelligence reached Taylor on 19 April 1846 that two vessels were spotted off
the mouth of the Rio Grande, he established another camp at that entry point to discourage use
of the river and to assist in its blockade (Fry 1848:88; Emory 1857:59).

The supply depot at Brazos Santiago played a crucial role during the Mexican War.
Major Thomas Eastland, Quartermaster for the U.S. Army at Brazos Santiago from 24 March 1847
until 31 October 1848, described U.S. military operations on Brazos Island for that period in great
detail in a summary report to the Quartermaster General, dated 3 February 1849. Several
descriptive excerpts from his report, transcribed as Letter 9 of Appendix A, are reproduced below.
This Depot was the great channel through which passed the troops and
supplies for the Army operating on the upper line and from which was
embarked the returning Army, munitions of war, etc. The accumulation
of property (at the depot), therefore, was immense, and its protection a
matter of serious and anxious consideration. My predecessor (Captain
J.M. Still) had commenced erecting suitable warehouses, and I deemed
it my duty to continue until all the stores (subject to injury from
exposure) were safely sheltered....houses were built capable of holding
all the stores then exposed on the beach (under cloth covers) or to
arrive. ...Suitable buildings were also erected for officers and soldiers
quarters, mechanics, and others in Government service, and for work
shops, etc.
For giving greater facility to receiving and shipping property, etc. and to
save demurrage...it became necessary to construct wharves, this was done
in a very cheap manner, by using old vessels, no longer fit for service.
As many as seven vessels could be accomadated [sic] at the same time.
A cheap breastwork (of Palmetto Jogs) was made along the beach in
front of the Public property, which had a good effect in protecting the
shore from the wash of the sea.
The frequent occasion to repair vessels, and the great expense of sending
them abroad for that purpose, made it necessary to establish a ship yard.
A set of ways were built, and all the appertenances necessary for
repairing vessels were procured, this was likewise done at the Mouth of
the Rio Grande, there also, were established a machine shop and

foundry, thus giving the means of making almost every repair required
by either steam or sail vessels ...
...Steam vessels were kept at Braros for towing over the bar and at no
time (unless during very bad weather) was public business suspended for
want of means... Within the time I had charge of this Depot 1155
vessels (brigs, barks, schooners, etc.) were towed in and out of the
harbor...

Among other of my receipts and issues of public property may be named
560,786 bushels oats, 115,940 bushels corn, 5,311,714 pounds hay; 86,658
barrels stone coal...
An abundant supply of good water was obtained from the Rio Grande
by the returning wagon trains ...

The business of the Depot at Point Isabel (also under my supervision)
though inconsiderable, was satisfactorily conducted (Major Thomas
Eastland; Appendix A, Letter 9).

Figure 9 illustrates a half dozen buildings clustered at the northwest corner of Braws Island and
a wagon road leading down the beach to a bridge across Boca Chica. Eastland mentions the bridge
and the mode of transportation between Braros Santiago and the mouth of the Rio Grande. A
second wagon road can be seen leading from the Rio Grande depot along the north bank of the
river toward Camp Belknap. This road led to Matamoros. Webster's map (Figure 9) does not
indicate the locations or numbers of wharves built from scuttled vessels, although these would most
likely have been located immediately opposite the cluster of buildings shown, at least some of the
latter presumably being warehouses.
It is interesting to note the mention in Eastland's report of drinking water being
transported from the Rio Grande. Following exposure of archaeological remains at Braros
Santiago by Hurricane Beulah in 1967, several brackish water barrel wells were observed and
mapped by Corbin and Webb (1967). These features may date from the Civil War occupation by
Union forces during times when access to the Rio Grande was cut off by Confederate troops.

The shipyard and marine ways does not appear to have been built on Braros Island
until after Eastland took over as Quartermaster in 1847. The previous Quartermaster, Captain
J.M. Still, apparently Jacked these facilities in November of 1846 when he suggested sending the
lighter Monmouth to New Orleans for repairs to her boiler and superstructure (Appendix A, Letter
2). This same letter indicates that the "General Hospital, clothing and ordnance depots" were
located at Point Isabel rather than on Braros Island.
As suggested by Eastland's report above, "the accumulation of property...was
immense.• The large quantity of stores deposited at Braros Santiago included clothing, food, and
. ammunition for the soldiers on the northern front of the war, draft animals and wagons for
transporting these supplies to the front, and forage for hundreds upon hundreds of horses and
mules. The distribution of these supplies was accomplished both by lightering cargo from Braros

Santiago to Point Isabel and to the Rio Grande mouth and by wagon train from all three points.
Captain Still reported on the transportation means available at Braws Island in a letter to the
Quartermaster General dated 4 November 1846. The following excerpts from Still's letter (see
Appendix A, Letter 1) convey the size of this undertaking.
On the 2nd ultimo, I sent to Camargo 125 - Five Mule teams and
wagons. Since which I have sent there 508 wagons and have now on
hand [at Braws Santiago] about 1242 mostly 4 Horse wagons.

~

1--:J

The mules I now have on hand are very small and inferior having been
left after selecting several hundreds to put to wagons out of about 1000.
As soon as I receive those that Col. Hunt is now sending me, I shall
mingle them with those I have and push them forward with wagons. All
the serviceable horses which I have received have been forwarded to the
army. I have now on hand, including what is afloat, 15,683 bushels com,
79,000 bushels oats, and 176,000 lbs hay (Captain J.M. Still 1846;
Appendix A, Letter 1).

In this same letter, Still listed 22 vessels, including one storeship (the storeship Ursula was not
afloat), that were "on hand". This number included 8 steamers, 10 schooners, 2 sloops and 1 bark.
All except the storeship were employed for lightering supplies between Brazos Santiago and either
Point Isabel or the mouth of the Rio Grande.

Following the Battle of Resaca de la Palma on 9 May 1846, the front line of the war
moved south into Mexico where the remainder of the war was fought. Having secured the lower
Rio Grande and with troops stationed along its northern bank, Taylor directed Major John
Saunders, an army engineer, to obtain steamboats and pilots so that troops and supplies could be
ferried to his next base at Camargo, in preparation for his advance on Monterrey (Vezzetti
1986:77). Saunders chose Captain Mifflin Kenedy, an experienced riverboat pilot, to head the
operation. Kenedy hired Captain Richard King to assist him. When General Taylor gathered his
forces to pursue the Mexican army into the interior, he and his staff were transpi>rted up the Rio
Grande from Fort Brown to Camargo on the steamboat Corvette (Pipkin 1940:81). As far as is
known, this was the beginning of continuous steam navigation on the lower Rio Grande and the
first since Henry Austin gave up his similar venture in 1831.
The Post-War Period

! '

I

Following the war, the U.S. Army maintained its depot at Braros Santiago. Soon after
hostilities ended, the army dispersed unnecessary stores, equipment and buildings to other posts.
Major Eastland, Quartermaster at Braws Island, reported on 1 September 1848 that he was
"sending to Fort Brown all the Ware Houses that can be spared and selling off the small houses
at fair prices" (Appendix A, Letter 6). Several buildings, however, remained in use at the Braws
Island depot following the war.
On 19 September 1848, a gale struck Braros Island. In his 24 September 1848 report
of this event, Eastland mentions several structures remaining on the island.

12950/910040

During the gale the water rose about 13 inches over the land
immediately in front of the wharves, surrounding all the public buildings
and extending back to the sand hills, but no damage (worth mentioning)
was sustained ...

n

H

On the sand hills (where the Barracks are situated) there was perfect
safety, even if the water had risen 15 feet. They are about half a mile
from the public landing... (Thomas Eastland 1848; Appendix A, Letter 7).

r

I .

By 8 November 1848, removal of buildings from Brazos Island was still progressing.
Major W.W. Chapman, the new Assistant Quartermaster at Brazos Santiago, reported then that
the marine ways were present and operational (two vessels were under repair at that time). Of
buildings at Brazos Santiago, he reported:
I have nearly removed the quarters and barracks from Mr. Dobbin's land.
The quarters I have sent to Point Isabel for the commanding officer; the
barracks will be sent to Clay Davis' Landing. In the course of ten days
all the Quartermaster's and Commissary stores will be removed into the
large storehouse, and all the buildings removed from that portion of Mr.
Dobbin's land which he requested in his letter to the Hon. Secretary of
War, dated August 1, 1848. That portion of the wharf required by him
is also ready to be turned over to him or his agent. ..

I'

...The Norther last Saturday re-opened Boca Chica. It was very severe
and carried away one wharf, and injured all [wharves] more or less.
Some 300 sacks of oats were carried away from one of the platforms
during the gale. The water came up around the Store houses and office
(W.W. Chapman 1848; Appendix A, Letter 8).
f •

In February 1849, Eastland reported, "Since the War, many of these houses [quarters, work shops,
etc.] have been removed to Fort Brown, leaving however, quite a sufficient number for all
purposes, under the peace establishment, should it be retained as a Depot" (Appendix A, Letter
9).
Following Eastland's report in February 1849, there seems to have been no further
mention of removing buildings from Brazos Island, although buildings continued to be lost or worn
down due to storm damage. Major Chapman reported one such storm in his letter of 28 May
1849:
... a violent storm prevailed here yesterday which caused considerable
damage to public and private property. The fence around the Depot and
the stable were blown down. The "Monmouth" dragged her anchors and
went ashore, but was got off without any damage. Every private vessel
in the harbor went ashore, except a Mexican schooner which sank at her
anchors in 20 or 30 feet of water...

129501910040

...Several private dwellings were blown down. About one half of the
bridge over Boca Chica was carried away. As the expense of repairing
it will be considerable...! would respectfully recommend that the bridge
be taken up and the Palmetto logs sent to Point Isabel (W.W. Chapman
1849; Appendix A, Letter 11).

r

The population of the island, as judged by the number of government employees, appears to have
stabilized by at least the latter part of 1849. In October 1849, the Quartermaster's Department
employed 86 persons, including 23 ship carpenters, 10 carpenters and 5 blacksmiths. By September
of the following year, there were still 60 government employees on Brazos Island. The number
of ship carpenters (20) remained relatively high in late 1850; however, only three regular
carpenters were employed, indicating that new construction, at least by the U.S. government, had
likely ceased (Appendix A, Letters 12, 13 and 14).
The post-war decline of Brazos Santiago is also suggested by the deterioration of
government wharf facilities there. Whereas, there were multiple wharves reported in the fall of
1848 (Appendix A, Letter 8), Major Chapman stated on 18 May 1850 that his only wharf boat had
"gone to pieces during the recent severe Northers" (Appendix A, Letter 16). This of course does
not exclude the possibility of private wharves being maintained, but Chapman makes no mention
of this. In the same letter, he proposed to scuttle the hulk of ·the propeller Colonel Stevens as a
new "wharf or rather pier head...The position in which I wish to place her will greatly protect the
depot from the action of the water, and particularly the coal pile, during Northers."
Just as the Brazos Santiago depot appeared likely to waste away, the economy of the
lower Rio Grande Valley came to its rescue. The war had stabilized the U.S. border at the Rio
Grande and resulted in a permanent American domination on the north side of the river. This
was an attractive market for entrepreneurs who promised to change the focus of economic
endeavor throughout the valley.

The steamboat firm of M. Kenedy and Co. was formed in 1850 and had a virtual
monopoly for the next 20 years on trade between Brazos Santiago and Rio Grande towns such as
Matamoros and Brownsville. Captains Miffiin Kenedy and Richard King, with the financial backing
oflongtime local merchant Charles Stillman, purchased the army's sternwheel steamboats after the
war to outfit their venture.
The establishment of political stability in the region also happened to coincide with
the California gold rush. Point Isabel and Brownsville, and undoubtedly Brazos Santiago, grew
busy outfitting men who were headed west along the Rio Grande to seek their fortunes in the gold
fields (McKenna 1956:14). Colonel John S. (Rip) Ford wrote in 1859 that merchandise coming
through Braws Santiago and on up the Rio Grande amounted to as much as ten million dollars
a year. He added that Morgan Line steamships were at anchor at the Braws wharf every eight or
ten days and that King and Kenedy had a fleet of steamboats running between Brownsville and
Braws Santiago (Ford 1963:269). This circa 1852 description of Brownsville and Matamoros
somewhat captures the mood of the dawning era of prosperity:
Gamblers and saloonkeepers from the States swarmed up from Point
Isabel and opened their ships to a rush of custom. Dance halls equipped

with musicians and girls and upstairs rooms, found a large trade...Sutlers
came with stores of goods, to be sold at sky-high prices ...shipments of ice
arrived, and whiskey juleps could be had at the bars (Horgan 1984:702703).

R

I,

In response to the increased trade and traffic at Brazos Santiago, Congress authorized
an appropriation of $15,000 in 1850 for •a lighthouse and beacon light" to be constructed on the
site of what had been Fort Polk (McKenna 1956:14; Lindsay 1975). The Point Isabel lighthouse
(Light No. 364 of the 9th Lighthouse District) was built in 1852 as a 57-ft brick tower, painted
white. It was refitted in 1857 with a single fixed beacon, flashing at one-minute intervals and
visible for 16 nautical miles. A lighthouse was also built on the southeast corner of Padre Island
in this same year, was refitted in 1854, and was still in place in 1858. The Padre Island Beacon
(Light No. 363 of the 9th District) was a fixed light atop a black square wooden tower. The
beacon was 35 ft above sea level and visible for 10 nautical miles. A lighthouse had also been
authorized for the mouth of the Rio Grande by 1858 (U.S. Light-House Board 1858). In 1859,
preliminary permission was granted to the Light-House Board to place a beacon atop the cupola
of the Quarter Master's warehouse at Brazos Santiago. This permission was apparently rescinded
by General Twiggs of the Department of Texas, fearing that access to the beacon by means of an
outside stairway would render the stores insecure (Appendix A, Letter 29). The first Brazos Island
beacon does not appear on maps until at least 1867, although research has not confirmed the date
of its construction. This beacon had been abandoned by 1879 when an iron tower and beacon was
erected slightly offshore from the southwest corner of Padre Island (Figure 10; Pierce 1917:143).

A military presence was maintained at Brazos Santiago Depot throughout the 1850s,
although Fort Polk was abandoned in 1850 and a number of its buildings moved to other, nearby
forts (Banks 1983:23). Several military inspections and government surveys of Braros Island and
its harbor were conducted during this period, presumably in response to economic growth in the
region and the increasing importance of Brazos Santiago. One such survey was made by
Lieutenant George McClellan, U.S. Army Engineer, during the winter of 1852-53. McClellan's
report, dated 18 April 1853, characterized the Brazos Santiago bar as "probably the roughest on
the coast of Texas." Regarding all of the Texas coast harbor bars, he says:

Ii _;

They are all of a quicksand formation, hard as rock to the touch of the
sounding pole, but acted upon with extraordinary facility by the water.

i

On some of them, especially the Brazos Santiago Bar, it is impossible to
maintain buoys for any length of time in the same position, their anchors
soon working their way through the sand, & dragging them down.

~

;

!'

It is difficult to imagine anything more changeable than are all these
bars. The channels over them are, literally, constantly shifting, & cannot
be depended on from day to day (McClellan 1853; Appendix A, Letter
19).

McClellan advised against any attempt to improve the bar at Brazos Santiago, believing that any
such improvement would be very temporary (Appendix A, Letter 21).

Another inspection of Braws Island was performed in compliance with the Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo, in which the United States agreed to maintain border posts to help prevent
marauding Indians from invading Mexico (Crimmins 1948:54). W.G. Freeman's 1853 inspection
report shows that he did not actually visit Brazos Santiago Depot:

R

Captain Van Vliet at Fort Brown, told me there was nothing to be seen
there except the buildings, and I obtained from him all the information
concerning it that will probably be deemed essential.

I

The depot, a rough sketch (See Map [whereabouts unknown]) of which
and of the adjacent country accompanies this report, is on the island of
Braws Santiago, nine miles from the mouth of the Rio Grande and
thirty miles in an easterly direction, from Fort Brown. It is approached
by the channel around the north end of.the island, which at full tides has
a depth of eight feet. Vessels drawing 7 1/2 feet can cross the bar at
certain stages of water, but none of more than 6 1/2 feet draft should be
freighted by the government. The mail is received semi-monthly by
steamer from New Orleans. Fort Brown and Ringgold Barracks are the
only [military] posts that receive supplies through the Brazos. The stores
are transported by contract--a steamer running from the depot to Fort
Brown, in connection with one from that post to Ringgold Barracks.
This contract was entered into by Bvt. Maj. Chapman, Asst.
Quartermaster, with M. Kennedy [sic) & Co., for two years from
February 10, 1852 [see also Appendix A, Letter 22). The rates paid
(which will be given hereafter [see Appendix A, Letter 23]) seem to me
high, but they were doubtless the most advantageous that could be
obtained at the time.

Three citizens are employed, a clerk at $75 per month, a boatman at $30,
and a labourer to take care of horses, assist with boats, etc., at $15. The
Government does not own the land on which the depot stands . A guard
of one corporal and two privates is detached from Fort Brown for the
protection of the depot buildings (quoted in Crimmins 1948:100-101).

i

I:
!:

The point made by Freeman that the government did not own the depot land is a
minor one that seems to have been referred to as early as November 1848 by Major Chapman
(Appendix A, Letter 8). Chapman referred several times to a Mr. Dobbins who claimed title to
the depot property. Two years later, the case of ownership went to District Court in Cameron
County. In November of 1851, Leonard Dobbin had filed suit against the U.S., claiming title. At
the same time a William Patterson had filed an intervention against both the government and
Leonard Dobbin. The attorneys representing both private parties dropped their cases without
taking the issue to trial and the issue of ownership seemed to be resolved in favor of the U.S.
government (Appendix A, Letters 17 and 18). Although another claimant to the land may have
come forward by 1853, it would appear that Freeman was in error with his statement.
One year after Freeman's second-hand report regarding Brazos Santiago, the U.S.
Coast Survey mapped the topography of Brazos Island in detail. The original of this 1854 map was

photographed by EH&A at the National Ocean Service hydrographic archives in Maryland. The
Braws Island portion of this map is reproduced as Figure 11. At least SO structures are indicated
on this map of Braws Island, in addition to six on Clark Island and three on Padre Island.
Two wharves are also clearly shown at the northwest comer of Braws Island. The
configuration of the westernmost wharf indicates that it may be a wharfboat connected to the island
by a pier. If true, this may be the position of the Colonel Stevens which Major Chapman had
proposed to scuttle adjacent the depot as a wharfboat "pier head" in 1850 (Appendix A, Letter 16).
A letter, dated 18 November 1854, from Captain Stewart Van Vliet at Fort Brown, described the
destruction of a wharf at Braws Santiago Depot.
Ten days ago (November 8th] a heavy N.E. gale carried away nearly all
the piles which supported the wharf and it is now necessary that it should
be entirely rebuilt. From the fact that wooden piles cannot be driven in
the quick sand of the Braws, I would recommend that the iron screw
pile should be used instead unless the expense should forbid it ...
The water has encroached upon one of the storehouses and a row of
piles will have to be run in front of it to prevent its being overthrown
[sic?]. These however can be of wood and worked in by hand (Van Vliet
1854; Appendix A, Letter 24 [see also Letter 25]).
From subsequent descriptions (below), it would appear that the wharf carried away
in November 1854 was the westernmost of the wharves illustrated by the U.S. Coast Survey in that
same year (Figure 11). This wharf had not been replaced as of 24 January 1855. Van Vliet
reported in a letter of that date:
I have received through Col. AC. Myers AQ.M. your [Major General
T.S. Jesup's, U.S. Quartermaster General] instructions with regard to the
wharf at this place. There can be obtained here an abundance. of
Palmetto logs for its repair but I most respectfully suggest that iron piles
would be superior in every respect ... Before commencing these repairs I
have thought it proper to state the objections to the wooden piles &
suggest a substitute...

r

I

I

I:

Should I be relieved from duty here before comencing this work which
I presume will be the case...I can tum over whatever instructions you
may send me to my successor (Van Vliet 1855; Appendix A, Letter 26).

II I.

!
r ;

I

It seems unlikely, given the instructions of the U.S. Quartermaster General, implied in Van Vliet's
January 1855 letter, that the wharf was rebuilt using anything but locally available Palmetto logs
for pilings.
A faint line extending southeastward from the wharf area in Figure 11, and then
westward to the shore of Braros Island, is believed to be a fence surrounding the government
depot. All structures located outside of this fenced area, constituting the majority of buildings on
the island, are presumed to have been privately owned. A brief report of the Braros Santiago

In 1856, Colonel Joseph Mansfield visited Braws Santiago Depot. His inspection
report included a sketch of the buildings enclosed within the fenced depot compound (Figure 12).
Mansfield wrote:
The Depot of Brazos Santiago is a good one and accessible to vessels
from all parts of the U. States, being at the entrance to the bay at Point
Isabell [sic), and nine miles along shore from the mouth of the Rio
Grande; and steamers pass out of that river and take in their loads for
the supply of the posts on that river without difficulty. It is 35 miles by
land from fort [sic] Brown. This depot is indispensible and in connexion
[sic] with that at Indianola will answer all the demands of the Service
(quoted in Crimmins 1939:130).
The exact date of the Figure 12 sketch is unknown; however, given that Mansfield conducted his
visit in 1856, and knowing that a "new wharf" was constructed at the depot in 1855, suggests a date
no earlier than February 1855. A comparison of figures 11 and 12 also confirms the identity of
the fenced government depot area in Figure 11.

In March 1857, the Assistant Quartermaster at Fort Brown submitted a requisition for
materials needed to make repairs at Brazos Santiago Depot. This requisition (Appendix A, Letter
28) provides many specific construction details regarding the government buildings illustrated at
the depot in figures 11 and 12. Among the buildings identified in the requisition are: a stable,
measuring 75 x 35 ft; a two-story building used for office and store rooms, measuring 70 x 30 ft;
a storehouse, measuring 120 x 70 ft; a set of quarters having 4 rooms; and a platform and small
store houses in front [of the large storehouse]. The quarters were surrounded by a 7-ft high,
480-ft-long fence (see faint inner depot fence in Figure 11). The perimeter of the depot was
marked by a 10-ft-high, 1500-ft-long fence. All of the buildings and fences were whitewashed with
lime; the window shutters, etc. on the quarters were to be painted "Paris green"; and the doors and
shutters on the storehouses, office and boats were to be painted "Chrome ·green". Apparently,
there was some discussion at this time between the U.S. Quartermaster General and Colonel AS.
Johnston, commanding the Department of Texas, "as to the importance, at present, of Brasos [sic]
Santiago for a depot...• (Appendix A, Letter 27). Colonel Johnston had, therefore, deferred the
decision regarding the above requisition to Major General Jesup, U.S. Quartermaster General.
The repairs presumably were made and the buildings given a fresh coat of paint, as the depot
remained under Government operation until at least 1860.
In February 1859 the U.S. Army posts at Fort Brown, Ringgold Barracks and Fort
Mcintosh were abandoned. Government property stored at those places was transferred to the
Quartermaster's warehouse at Brazos Santiago for storage (Appendix A, Letter 29). This fact gave
a renewed importance to the depot; however, this was only a temporary state of affairs. ·on 22
April 1860, a new requisition was submitted for funds to repair the public buildings and fences at
Brazos Santiago (Appendix A, Letter 32). In the letter accompanying his requisition, Lieutenant
AC. Gillem wrote:

.. .it will be observed that the greater part of the estimate is for enclosing
the grounds with a good fence. ...should Braws ever be required as a
large Depot it would be true economy to enclose the ground as marked
in the plan, as there is a person signing himself "John V. Singer, agent
for Johana [sic] Shaw• who lays claim to the entire island, Depot
included, and should the fence not be made I think it more than
probable that he or some person holding under him will endeavor to
build so near the Depot buildings as to make it necessary either to rent
from them or enter a suit to remove them, which in either case cost
much more than the $490.90 required. Whilst I was at the Braws,
Singer or some person acting for him surveyed the island, Government
property included" (A.C. Gillem 1860; Appendix A, Letter 32).

That Singer and his associates were indeed planning major development of both Braz.cs and Padre
islands is attested by his advertisements in local newspapers (see Appendix A, Letters 30 and 31).
Upon receiving the latest requisition for repairs to Braz.cs Santiago Depot, the Chief
Quartermaster for the Department of Texas, Major D.H. Vinton, replied on May 18th:

.M
f-

Before any action can be taken in respect to your suggestions I desire
that you will report without delay whether the intprovements in question
are absolutely necessary ...or is it not better to dispense with the
depot. ..altogether (D.H. Vinton 1860; Appendix A, Letter 33).

Gillem replied later in May:
...I am convinced that the occupation of Braws as a Depot is not at. all
necessary, believing the present method of transporting stores more
economical than by landing them at Braws and transporting them thence
to this place [Brownsville) by wagons (Alvan C. Gillem 1860; Aprendix
A, Letter 34).

It is apparent from Gillem's reply that there was no wharf, or at least no serviceable wharf, at
Braws Santiago Depot in May 1860. This suggests that no wharves were built since 1855, the
approximate date of the "new wharf' shown in Figure 12. Also there was no bridge over Boca
Chica proper in May of 1860, although there was a bridge in disrepair over "a small bayou or
laguna" about ••..two hundred and fifty yards on this side [toward Brownsville] of the Boca Chica ...•

The Civil War
Prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, the citizens of Cameron County voted, along
with the majority of Texans, to secede from the Union and join the Confederacy. On 22 February
1861, E.B. Nichols, Commissioner for Texas, arrived at Fort Btown to request of the commander
in charge, Captain B.H. Hill, that those of his command not willing to join the Confederate cause
should leave the fort and the state immediately, surrendering their equipment and supplies. The
orders applied to all United States troops in Texas. Captain Hill at first seemed determined to
fight, but upon orders from General [David E.) Twigg, he yielded his troops. He refused to deliver

the supplies and ordnance, however, some of which were burned at Brazos Santiago (Pierce
1917:39; Ford 1963i319-320). All the Texan border garrisons below El Paso were evacuated by M.
Kenedy & Co. steamboats on the Rio Grande (Ford 1963:319), and Major Fitz John Porter,
Assistant Adjutant General, sailed from New York on the steamer Daniel Webster to collect the
U.S. troops at Brazos Santiago (Pierce 1917:39).
By 20 March 1861, all the Federal troops and officers were withdrawn from Brazos
Santiago. Texas Volunteers immediately manned the abandoned posts along the Rio Grande and
at Braws Santiago with Colonel P.N. Luckett and Colonel John S. Ford commanding until the
arrival of General H.P. Bee on 29 January 1863 (Pierce 1917:41; Ford 1963:319).. Fort Polk had
been abandoned soon after the Mexican War, but Fort Brown, temporarily vacated in the late
1850s, was re-garrisoned in 1859. The supply depot on Braws Island had been in continual use ·
since Taylor first established it in 1846. When the Federal troops withdrew from the island, 1500
Texas Volunteers immediately took their place at Braws Santiago Depot (Ford 1963:319).
Until late in 1863 the Confederates controlled the strategic economic and military
centers of the Rio Grande and the southern Gulf coast with little interference. This situation
changed when, on 1 November 1863, Union forces under command of Major General Nathaniel
P. Banks anchored off the bar at Braws Santiago. The next day, his 6,998 men came ashore on
the island and marched south across Boca Chica toward Brownsville (Pierce 1917:42-43; Banks
1983:30). Benjamin F. Mcintyre, of the 19th Iowa Infantry, described the island and what
remained of the depot at that time:
Braws as well as the islands along the Texan Coast is a sandy desert, a
house or two standing deserted. A mile or two interior are two
lighthouses--charred ruins of the three dwellings show plainly they have
been burned but a few days--nothing but the chimneys remain standing.

~I

The foundation of the buildings used by Gen. Taylor for stores can yet
be seen but no other vestige remains.
I will venture a description of the country through which we have passed
the last few days. In leaving the landing place we followed the sandy
beach several miles. The whole island is covered with heaps and piles
of broken pieces of ships, furniture, boxes, barrels, and hundreds of
other things much resembling a vast drift pile (quoted in Banks 1983:3233).

Il

I

r .

I

It appears from Mcintyre's description, and seems confirmed by an 1863 Union map of the island
(surveyed by order of Major D.C. Houston; not illustrated), that the Confederates burned every
structure remaining on Braws Island prior to their evacuation.

In a report to Governor Clark, Colonel John (Rip) Ford assessed the strategic
defenses of Brazos Santiago and found them wanting. He described the island and his reasons for
abandoning it in the following excerpt:

12950,910040

32

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

It was the opinion of all that Brazos Santiago is not defensible, that the

post should be abandoned for the present, and that we concentrate and
make a stand at this point [Fort Brown]. Captain (Stephen] Powers, who
was here on business, left at midnight, accompanied by Mr. Lawton of
the Engineer Department. To the captain was assigned the task of
superintending the withdrawal of men, ordnance, and supplies of every
kind from Brazos Island, and their transportation to this post by
steamboats and waggons [sic].

r;

It may not be amiss to say, that there is no water on Brazos Island, save
beach water of an unhealthy character--there are no rations--it is
isolated ...There are no guns of long range on the island. A war vessel
could shell a force out of Brazos Island without ever coming within reach
of any gun we have there. One revenue cutter could make the place
utterly useless to us (quoted in Banks 1983:30).

When word of the Union landing on Brazos Island reached General Bee on
2 November, he made hasty preparations to evacuate Fort Brown. On the afternoon of
3 November, Bee ordered all government buildings to be burned along with more than 200 bales
of unshipped cotton. He then marched his army north to Santa Gertrudis (Kingsville). The fire
quickly spread and destroyed an entire city block before reaching a warehouse holding 8,000
pounds of gunpowder. The explosion shook the area, adding to the chaos of people and horses
fleeing the burning city (Sides 1942:111-112). When the Union forces marched into Brownsville
three days later, they found Fort Brown destroyed and part of the town heavily damaged (Banks
1983:34). Union troops held Brownsville until 28 July 1864.
General FJ. Herron took command of the Union forces at Brownsville on 3 January
1864. He soon made the following recommendation to Chief of Staff, Charles P. Stone, regarding
Brazos Island and Point Isabel:
After three weeks' trial, I am satisfied that our line of communication via
Point Isabel is not the correct one under existing circumstances ...
What I propose to do is to build a wharf at Brazos Island and establish
the depots there, bridge Boca Chica, and transport all supplies by wagons
along the beach to the mouth of the Rio Grande, and shipping there on
river boats for Brownsville. It is 9 miles from the wharf at Brazos Island
to the mouth of the river, the road along the beach hard and in fine
condition. For a few days each month this road may be impassable, but
I propose to construct another road inside of the sand hills that will be
protected in all weather. By this route we shall have but 9 miles of land
transportation and can unload much more rapidly than by the present
way (quoted in Banks.1983:232).

In July 1864, Union forces were ordered to abandon "Fort Brown and its dependencies
on the Rio Grande" for New Orleans, leaving only a token force at Brazos Santiago (Banks

1983:35). Benjamin Mcintyre, as his regiment prepared to leave the Rio Grande, described the
area between White Ranch and Brazos Santiago:

R

Bagdad rests almost on a level with the waters of the Gulf and it is often
flooded by its waters a depth of several feet. A fleet of forty vessels
from nations are riding at anchor in the harbor. Opposite Bagdad on the
Texas side was Clarksville a small place of no importance. The buildings
have been for the most part taken down and removed to Brazos...

The 91st Ill. are camped on the west end of the Island-and 0 such a
camp--tents arranged on the loose sand-~no shade to Shield them from
the suns heat-no water except such as is brought eight miles distant
from the Rio Grande or manufactured from the water of the gulf. 0
none of us will envy them their enjoyment in this place! The east end
of the Island is pretty well covered with houses for government use and
presents quite a citylike appearance & is a busy mart. I saw here for the
first time a Steam condenser which transforms salt water into fresh and
it is a very good article (quoted in Banks 1983:36).

In a letter dated 11 February 1865, over one year after his original proposal to do so,
General Herron seemingly had not yet constructed his road. He wrote to General E.O.C. Ord that
the only good harbor for 241 km on either side of the Rio Grande was that at Brazos Island. He
discussed the then-current system of ferrying goods from Braws to Point Isabel and then overland
to Brownsville:
This will soon be changed and a new route opened along Brazos Island,
crossing Boca Chica, thence to the mouth of the river, where goods will
be reshipped on steamboats for Brownsville. The new route will have
many advantages over the old, in being entirely safe from guerrilla
parties and reducing land travel from 30 miles to 9.
There is evidence, however, that perhaps Herron had completed part of his road.
Furthermore, it seems likely that this was a railroad, the first on Brazos Island. Benjamin Mcintyre
of the 19th Iowa Infantry is the earliest known source of information regarding this railroad.
Mcintyre arrived on Brazos Island on 2 November 1863 and left via the same route in the latter
part of July 1864. His eyewitness account reads:

\ 1

l

...A railroad leading from Brazos and completed for several miles--the
iron laid the entire length of the Island. The Boca Chica had been
bridged by means of piling placed across the channel and filled between
with sand, forming a solid conexion [sic] of the Island with the mainland
thus saving time and expense of men, pontoon bridges or boats (quoted
in Banks 1983:36).
Two days after Union forces abandoned Brownsville, on 28 July 1864, Colonel John (Rip) Ford
of the Confederate army described Brazos Island as follows:

129501910040

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

The Federals had works at the end of Braz.as Island next to the Rio
Grande. During their occupation of the Brownsville area they had
transported some large pieces of artillery from Fort Brown to the island.
They had erected a railroad from the island to the White House, or
White Ranch as some chose to call it. The cars had ceased to run when
we reached Fort Brown. A bridge had been built over the Boca Chica,
but had been washed away (Ford 1963:368).

R
r·

I

Although Ford reported the railroad bridge across Boca Chica as "washed away", the
following excerpt suggests that it was probably destroyed during the withdrawal of Union troops
from Brownsville on 26 July 1864, in order to protect the Union contingent which remained at
Braz.as Santiago for the remainder of the war.
...during the recent war ... the Boca Chica was closed by a dam thrown
across same by the United States troops, for use as a bridge, and which
they afterwards destroyed to prevent an attack from the Confederates
(C.A Whitney 1868; Appendix A, Letter 47).

I.
I
f-j

I

t ;

H

It should be pointed out here that, once Union troops had been ordered to evacuate
Brownsville in July 1864, there was no strategic value in maintaining a railroad that led in that
direction. The railroad bridge witnessed by Ford and the "dam" used as a bridge by Union troops
are one and the same. This is corroborated by Benjamin Mcintyre's description of Herron 's
railroad bridge:

I

The Boca Chica had been bridged by means of piling placed across the
channel and filled between with sand... (quoted in Banks 1983:36)
Additional evidence for a railroad on Braz.as Island prior to July 1864 is found in the
September and December 1864 reports of U.S. military construction on Braz.as Island. Captain
P.C. Hains, Acting Chief Engineer, Department of the Gulf, reported on the progress of building
defensive works on the north end of the island (Figure 13):
It will require about 100,000 feet of lumber for the parapet alone in
addition to what can be had from R.R. ties (P.C. Hains 1864; Appendix
A, Letter 35).

And in his report of operations for December 1864:
The magazine constructed in Redoubt B in rear of the left flank is 13'
long, 8 wide & 5' high, (in clear), with entrance 3' wide. The wood work
of this magazine is constructed of Rail Road ties 8" in thickness .•. (P.C.
Hains 1865; Appendix A, Letter 37).
It is implied by Hains that the railroad ties were available locally. Since no other
railroad had been constructed in the lower Rio Grande Valley or vicinity by this date, it must be
presumed that these ties were borrowed from Herron's railroad which had been rendered
inoperable when the Boca Chica bridge was destroyed prior to 28 July 1864. Interestingly enough,

a shipwreck near the entrance to Brazos Santiago Harbor with a • ...cargo said to be rail-road iron,
lost during the war... • was mentioned in a letter regarding harbor obstructions 13 years later
(Appendix A, Letter 60) .
Herron's railroad must have been built after his letter of 3 January 1864 (quoted in
Banks 1983:232) and probably was completed after February 1864 when Lt. Colonel Wrolnowski
mapped the "Environs of Brazos Island" without indicating the presence of a railroad. In fact,
Herron's railroad, which seems, without a doubt, to have been constructed, does not appear on any
known maps. Consequently, the route followed by Herron's railroad is unknown.
Upon the heels of the Civil War, General Grant ordered Major General Phil H.
Sheridan with 25,000 troops to the border region to restore order along the border but especially
to discourage any attempts by a coalition of French Imperialists in Mexico and Confederates to re·
commence hostilities with the United States (Pierce 1917:60; Pipkin 1940:113). Arriving at Brazos
Island on 23 June 1865, General Sheridan found it difficult to land troops at the mouth of the Rio
Grande, as the average depth of the water on the bar at Bagdad and Clarksville was only 2-1/2 ft
(Pierce 1917:60). General Sheridan proposed to rebuild the railroad from the north end of Braws
Island, along the island to Boca Chica and from that point to White's Ranch on the Rio Grande,
a distance of about 29 km (Pipkin 1940:114). Frank C. Pierce, writing in 1917, described it as:
...a railroad from Braws along the island 18 miles west and southwest to
a point on the river then known as WHITE'S RANCH, long since
washed away by the river encroachments (Pierce 1917:61).
In a letter to Chief of Staff J.A Rawlins, written on 5 August 1865, Sheridan seems
to confirm the source of the railroad ties used in building Redoubt B on Braws Island:

I directed the railroad from Brazos in the direction of Boca Chica to the
Rio Grande, at White's Ranch, to be builded [sic] when I first came to
this command. This involved only the expense of cross-ties, as we have
everything else. The contract for these ties has been disapproved on the
strength of an order obtained from the Secretary of War for the
continuance of this road to Brownsville from White's Ranch. The short
road from Brazos for which these ties were gotten out and delivered long
ago is so necessary, that it seems like a want of reflection or a suggestion
on the part of some old man who was in the Mexican War when we got
along without it. The sooner these people die off the better it will be for
the public economy (War of the Rebellion, Series I, Volume XLVIII,
Part II, 1880-1901:1165).
Sheridan's railroad may have been completed by the fall of 1865, as the ties seem to have been
delivered prior to S August. No railroad appears on the map of Brazos Island (Figure 13) received
in the Engineering Department, Department of the Gulf, on 10 July 1865; however, this is at least
six months after Hains had reported using the railroad ties of Herron's railroad in the construction
of defensive works on Brazos Island (Appendix A, Letter 37). Sheridan had been on Brazos Island
less than a month by 10 July. Even if the railroad had been rebuilt' by this date, the map shown
in Figure 13 was no doubt many days or weeks old by the time it was received in the Engineering

Department in New Orleans on 10 July. Sheridan's railroad certainly was finished by 23 January
1866 when a map of its route first appears.
During the course of the Civil War, a number of structures seem to have been built
on Braws Island, in addition to a railroad. In February 1864, slightly more than three months after
the Union forces arrived on the island, Wrolnowski's map of the "Environs of Brazos Island"
showed the locations of the Confederate 16th Infantry and the 1st Regular Confederate States
Engineers, as well as the presence of a star-shaped fortification and one wharf. Presumably these
features were mapped in retrospect, since the Confederates did not occupy the island in February
1864. The star-shaped fort was later expanded by Union forces with the addition of several other
redoubts and a linear line of fortifications between them (see Appendix A, letters 35-37 and
Figure 13). Figure 13 also shows the locations of "old C.S. buildings" and the presence of two
wharfs, apparently as these structures appeared in the summer of 1865. The eastern wharf no
longer extends beyond the shoreline and could be mistaken for a building were it not for an 1866
reference to an "old" wharf having been filled in with sand between its pilings (Appendix A,
Letter 38).

By the close of hostilities, Brazos Island was growing in population and was preparing
for a renewal of commercial shipping. The U.S. Government continued to maintain a depot at
Braws Santiago following the war. Brazos Island was the transhipment point for quartermaster
stores to support Sheridan's occupying force. Having been run down extensively and nearly
abandoned as a depot prior to the war, by July 1865, the same month that Sheridan arrived with
25,000 troops, the island had at least 17 buildings on its northern end, another five at the hospital
site on Dyer's Island, and at least one wharf. Six months later, in January 1866, a map of Brazos
Island (Figure 14) shows at least 70 distinct buildings on the north end of the island and another
50 smaller symbols which also are presumed to be structures. The hospital had been moved to the
north end of the island by this time. Figure 14 shows 12 large barracks buildings, as well as a tent
camp, the latter near the hospital buildings. Four wharves show clearly along the north shore of
the island. This is the earliest known appearance of a beacon on Brazos Island. Figure 14 also
shows the route of Sheridan's railroad between Brazos Santiago and White's Ranch for the first
time (this map has the earliest and most detailed view of White's Ranch known to the researchers).
A rail spur clearly is shown extending along the full length of one wharf at the northwest comer
of the island.
A "new and excellent wharf' was completed on the island in April 1866 (Appendix A,
Letter 38). It measured 130 x 75 ft and had "12 ft of water at its front at even tide.• This wharf
was located "just west of the old forage wharf, with which it connects, giving a bonus front of 150
feet." The "new" wharf was "extended far enough into the channel to prevent the sand washing in
& filling it up as it did the old one."
The piling [for the new wharf] is all of cypress lumber (7000 cubic feet)
being a surplus of that received for the Rail Road Bridge [Sheridan's) at
Boca Chica. The flooring is of 3 inch spruce plank (35,000 feet)
(W.H.D. Cochrane 1866; Appendix A, Letter 38).
In the spring of 1867, topographic and hydrographic surveys (Figure 15) showed at
least 69 buildings on the north end of Brazos Island, including troop barracks and the hospital

complex. The arrangement of buildings is similar to that in Figure 14, although there appear to
be significantly fewer buildings and the tent camp is no longer present. There are at least three
wharves shown. This is one Jess than in January 1866, even though a new wharf had been built
in April of that year, indicating that two wharves were no longer in service. One wharf, shown in
Figure 15, has a shipwreck indicated at its end. This wharf appears to be of the wharfboat type
and appears in the same position as the 1866 railroad wharf. Another shipwreck symbol is shown
adjacent the shoreline to the east of this wharf that may represent a fourth wharf in 1867.
By all indications, business was booming in the spring of 1867, although vessel traffic
and trade figures have not been obtained. The railroad had been operational for up to one and
a half years by this time. This was considered a U.S. military railroad, but it presumably also
carried private freights, shortening the freight time to Brownsville by eliminating the need for
steam lighters between Brazos Santiago and the mouth of the Rio Grande. One could anticipate
that such an arrangement would be very advantageous to both the military and to merchants. King,
Kenedy & Co., owners of the steam lighters, may have been Jess enthusiastic, however, due to the
probable decline in their lighterage income.
About this same time, another private claim was laid to Brazos Island. The claimants
had apparently offered the island up for sale to the government in the spring of 1867.
Undoubtedly there was a good deal of private enterprise on the island by this time, in addition to
the government depot and military buildings, for this issue did not go unnoticed. A Jetter to the
U.S. Quartermaster General from T J. Smith in New Orleans, dated 20 May 1867, explains the
situation.
I have understood that certain parties are endeavoring to effect a sale of
the Island of Brasos [sic] de Santiago...to the U.S. Government. I deem
it my duty to inform you directly that the parties referred to have no title
to the land from the state of Texas ...If the Govt. purchase their title, it
will Jose the money...[Besides which] •..if the Govt. purchased all of the
island they would virtually shut up the most important harbor on the
Texas coast to commerce. Capitalists in New York are anxious io build
a rail road up the Rio Grande, by which the U.S. Government will get
their freights reduced 100 pr. ct., but they will not invest unless the
Government will not attempt to purchase the whole island (TJ. Smith
1867; Appendix A, Letter 39).
Perhaps the most important point of the Smith's Jetter is that New York investors plan a railroad
"up the Rio Grande." Given later events, this could only mean a continuation of Sheridan's
railroad from White's Ranch to Brownsville, something which Sheridan himself had tried to push
through.
In the spring or summer of 1867, the Brazos Santiago railroad was sold to private New
York investors for $108,000. One account (Appendix A, Letter 48) claims that the sale was made
in the spring to Richard Cheney and J.C. Woods, both of New York, to George R. Giddings, and
to Brvt. Major General J.R. West. West was apparently the spokesman for this group of investors.
Another ac.;ount (Appendix A, Letter 49) indicates that the sale took place on or about 7 July
1867. Messrs. West and Cheney seem to have had the major interest in this purchase. Ten percent
was to have been paid at the time of the sale, and the balance was to be paid in two installments

1295-0/910040

41

four and eight months after the sale. The first installment was due on 7 November; however,
Messrs. West and Cheney defaulted on this payment and let the railroad revert to government
ownership.

The Quartermaster General seems to have incorrectly stated the year of the sale as
1866 (Appendix A, Letter 49), although four separate pieces of evidence indicate that the railroad
was sold in July of 1867: 1) TJ. Smith stated on 20 May 1867 that New York investors were
interested in building a railroad up the Rio Grande; 2) the local superintendent of the railroad,
Frederick M. Phelps, an employee of West and Cheney, stated that he was working for them there
in 1867 (Appendix A, Letter 48); 3) a letter from John E. Smith of the War Department to Phelps
used the 1867 date, even though he had knowledge of the Quartermaster General's letter
containing the 1866 date (Appendix A, Letter 50); and 4) a hurricane destroyed much of the
railroad on 7 October 1867, one month before the second installment was due (Appendix A, Letter
45). During West and Cheney's operation of the railroad, their largest customer was the
Quartermaster's Department at Brazos Island (Appendix A, Letter 48).
At about the same time that the Brazos Santiago railroad was sold, the U.S.
Government was planning the construction of additional troop barracks and officers' quarters on
the island. Detailed plans for these structures were drawn (plans on file at the National Archives,
Washington, D.C.; R.G. 92, Entry 225, Boxes 102-103) and were submitted with specifications and
estimates of materials on 11 July 1867 (Appendix A, letters 40-42). Two officers' quarters were
planned, each a one and a half-story, wood-frame building on a brick foundation. Each of these
buildings required 17,000 bricks for the foundation and chimney, combined. Interestingly enough,
these two buildings were to be anchored to the island using iron screw anchors. One of these
quarters was intended for a captain and a "Supernumerary officer" and the other for two
lieutenants. Each was lo have its own inside kitchen facility with a water cistern out back. One
two-story barrack was also planned, measuring 163 x 24 ft and built on brick piers. The barrack
was to be wood-framed with a large open porch, also supported by brick piers, running the full
length of both sides. An estimate of 13,000 bricks was made for building 85 piers and a central
chimney for this barrack. No evidence has been found to indicate whether these three structures
were built, nor where on the island they were intended to be placed.
Growth on Brazos Island following the Civil War, including the construction of a
railroad and several wharves, suggested that a bright economic future was in store. In July 1867
the railroad had been privatized. Plans were apparently being made to extend the railroad up the
Rio Grande to Brownsville. The military seemed to be building a "permanent" post on the island.
This brief period, from 1865 to 1867, was possibly the peak of commercial activity on Brazos
Island. Then:
On the 7 Oct. 1867 a hurricane destroyed ...every building at Brazos
Santiago. ...from the nature of the soil (sand) the [rail] road was
completely washed away in sections, and the buildings or sheds in which
the locomotive and other property [freight cars?] was then stored were
destroyed (Charles H. Tompkins 1868; Appendix A, Letter 45).
Following the hurricane, West and Cheney declined to continue payment for their
purchase of the railroad (the second installment was due on 7 November). As the railroad was

in terrible condition from the hurricane, the Government advertised it for sale in December 1867.
The highest bid was $5,000 from King, Kenedy & Co. Having sold the railroad for $108,000 only
six months earlier, the Government was not anxious to accept such a low hid. Charles Tompkins,
Chief Quartermaster of the Fifth Military District in New Orleans, finally convinced General D.H.
Rucker, the Acting Quartermaster General, that the railroad was only suitable as iron stock and
that, in his opinion, it was only worth $2,400, about half what King, Kenedy & Co. had offered
(Appendix A, Letter 44).

General Rucker directed Tompkins to accept the offer of $5,000 in March of 1868,
upon which King, Kenedy & Co. withdrew their offer. The railroad was immediately put up for
sale again, but the highest bid was now only $2400, precisely what Tompkins had estimated as its
value. The names of the bidders are unknown; however, the high (or perhaps only) bidder seems
to have had inside information regarding the minimum acceptable offer. Perhaps sensing this,
General Rucker ordered, on 18 April 1868, that the "iron of the road", the locomotive, and all
moveable property be collected and stored until such time as a fair price could be obtained.
Tompkins responded on 26 April that he would comply with these orders "at once", but under
continued protest that the labor of gathering up the rails would "cost more than the entire stock
is worth." It is obvious from Tompkins letters that he wanted the railroad sold at any price
(Appendix A, letters 43-45).
The Brazos Island railroad was finally sold, by 10 September 1868, to the Indianola
Railroad Company for $20,000 (Appendix A, Letter 46). By this date the headquarters of the Fifth
Military District had been moved from New Orleans to Austin and General Tompkins .was no
longer Chief Quartermaster of the District. Presumably though, he had followed Rucker's orders
and had gathered the "iron of the road." This could explain the c0nsiderably higher purchase price
of $20,000, since the Indianola Railroad Company could ship the stock from Brazos Island without
paying to have it taken up and transported to a wharf at Brazos Santiago. While there is
archaeological evidence to suggest that Tompkins did not gather all of the iron rails, there is no
historic evidence to suggest that the railroad was put back into service on Brazos Island following
the 1867 hurricane.
·
Prior to the change in the Fifth Military District, General Tompkins had directed that
a dam be constructed across Boca Chica .. Charles Whitney, the New Orleans agent for the Morgan
Steamship Line, wrote the Quartermaster General on 14 October 1868 to congratulate him on the
success of this project, but also to encourage him to protect the flanks of the dam from erosion.

... the dam was quite completed when a change took place in the Military
Districts, and Genl. Reynolds ordered all further work to cease, which
left the dam quite unprotected on its wings or flanks ..
A week ago there was scarcely (5) five feet depth of water on the
bar...The first Norther of the season came, and in 48 hours the stormy
entrance currents ... have increased the depth to (10) ten feet which is
quite 2 feet more than our steamers have found for a number of years.
In fact, such depth has never been known on Brazos bar, except during
the recent war when the Boca Chica was closed by a dam thrown across

This is the first )mown engineering effort designed for the purpose of improving Brazos Santiago

harbor. Although initially encouraging, the dam failed to maintain an increased channel depth over
the bar. Boca Chica remained completely closed in 1871 with no effect on the bar (Appendix A,
Letter 52).
Despite the extensive damage to Brazos Santiago dealt by the 1867 hurricane, the
harbor was still a necessity to merchants in Matamoros and Brownsville. By April 1868, plans had
been drawn up for a new government wharf and warehouse (figures 16 and 17, respectively).
These structures were presumably built soon after April. This wharf remained in use through the
early 1870s.
In August 1870, Simon Celaya of Brownsville secured a charter for the Rio Grande
Railroad proposed between Point Isabel and Brownsville. There was a great interest on the part
of this railroad company and of the residents of Point Isabel to see the harbor at Brazos Santiago
improved. In January 1871, Lt. H.M. Adams, Corps of Engineers, was ordered to survey the
harbor and pass at Brazos Santiago "for the purpose of collecting all information needed to form
plans & estimates for such work of improvement ...• (Appendix A, Letter 51). Adams had
completed his survey by 2S February.
During his stay at Brazos lsland, he inquired with the U.S. Customs Collector at Point
lsabel regarding import and export statistics. Foreign and "bonded goods" traded through Brazos
Santiago during the year 1869-1870 totalled $4,293,457, with $2,624,794 worth of that being exports.
The primary trade merchandise included: "Hides, wood [or wool?), [illegible), goat skins, coffee,
sugar, [illegible] cocoa, dry goods, machinery, tobacco, wines, liquors, etc.• (Appendix A, Letter 53).
During 1869, 102 vessels (foreign and licensed tonnage only) entered Brazos Santiago Harbor,
totalling 42,110 tons and having crews totalling 1,963 sailors. During 1870, these numbers dropped
slightly to 86 vessels, totalling 40,176 tons and 1,495 crew (Appendix A, Letter 52). Adams' 1871
hydrographic survey map of the harbor pass and bar (Figure 18) shows the location of the
Government Wharf. At that time, it was one of two wharves on Brazos lsland, although the other
wharf was considerably smaller.

The result of Adams' survey was a recommendation that any harbor improvements
attempted would be very expensive and very temporary. He estimated the cost for a single
concrete jetty at $774,630, but believed this expense was not justified given the expected results
(Appendix A, Letter 52).
On 14 August 1871, King, Kenedy & Company proposed to rent the Government
Wharf and warehouse at Brazos Santiago for the sum of $1Cl00 per year (Appendix A, Letter 55).
King and Kenedy had held a virtual monopoly on transhipment of merchandise form Brazos
Santiago up the Rio Grande to Brownsville or across the Laguna Madre to Point lsabel, but they
were not the only persons to utilize the Government Wharf. Their proposal resulted in a
tremendous outcry. Complaints were received by the government from several companies,
including: Charles T. & N. Chester, Manufactures, Importers and Dealers in Telegraph and
Electrical Instruments and Supplies, New York (Appendix A, Letter 56); Woodhouse, Southmayd

& Rudd of New York; and the Rio Grande Rail Road C.Ompany. H.E. Woodhouse complained
that neither King, Kenedy & C.O. nor Morgan Llne steamships were charged any wharfage by the
government, whereas his own steamships were charged fifty cents per ton for wheeling coal from
his nearby coal house across the Government. Wharf to steamships of his line. To be fair, he
thought the wharfage should be standardized and that if the wharf was to be leased, this process
should be opened to public bidding (Appendix A, Letter 57).

Simon Celaya, President of the Rio Grande Rail Road C.Ompany, was concerned that
King and Kenedy would close the use of this wharf to his company in a ploy to prevent the railroad
from being completed. He wrote the following on 1 November 1871:
I beg respectfully to present a few remarks against the acceptance of
such an offer, as being... calculated to promote a monopoly which has
smothered the advancement of this frontier and which expects to destroy
the prospects and delay the construction of the railroad which I
represent.
We are now actively engaged in constructing the railroad from Point
Isabel to Brownsville...
We will need this wharf, the only one at Braws, in the construction of
our road, in the landing of supplies, material, etc... To place it in the
hands of those who could and would exclude us from the use of it, would
be showing a partiality which, I know, is foreign to the intention of the
government (Celaya 1871; Appendix A, Letter 58).

H
!
'

~j'
!

The wharf apparently was never leased, for no further mention seems to have been made of the
incident.
In the fall of 1875, a full-rigged brig of 350-400 tons, Rene des Mers, sank in the pass
at Brazos Santiago after striking an old anchor. Futile attempts were made to raise the vessel.
By 29 November of the following year, the wreck was becoming an obstruction to navigation in the
harbor.

She is lying on the east side of the middle ground almost abreast the old
Gov. wharf [no longer in use]. The channel to the new wharf is filling
up by the gradual extension of the point of the spit from the wreck to
the shore, making a shoal and sharp turn in the channel dangerous in
flood tide or heavy weather. I have tried to blow her up but there is no
one here who can work under water (Charles Whitney & C.O. 1876;
Appendix A, Letter 59).
By February 1877, the U.S. Army Engineers were considering means and expenses to remove the
wreck. Captain James Gregory inspected the vessel and reported on the need for a government
action to remove. this and other harbor obstructions at Braros Santiago.

... her hull is filled with sand ... She lies between the anchorage inside the
bar and the [new] wharf at Braws Santiago and about 350 yards distant
from the wharf. On a line from the wreck towards Point Isabel a middle
ground of sand has been formed since the wreck has been where she is,
which for 200 or 300 yards is nearly dry at low water. This was formerly
all good water ...It will be necessary to blow her to pieces with explosives
and to remove the fragments piecemeal. There are besides in the harbor
several iron obstructions, old anchors and shafts of steamers, some of
which were lost, others being purposely deposited during the
war ... Captain Baker pointed out to me their approximate locations, and
states that there are five or six of them (J.F. Gregory 1877; Appendix A,
Letter 60).

A contract for removal of the Rene des Mers was issued to the New Orleans Wrecking
Company in the amount of $6,000. ·The work was performed in December 1878. The work was
inspected by H.S. Douglas of the Army Engineers in New Orleans. Douglas stated that "to the best
of my belief, Greenleaf Andrews, president of New Orleans Wrecking Company, has fulfilled his
contract ... " (U.S. House ·of Representatives 1879). Apparently, however, he only removed the
upper portions of the hull, as it was hit by a dredge in 1927 and dynamited again (Alperin
1977:142).
By the 1870s, the Army Engineers had experimented with various harbor
improvements around the country, with mixed success. The expense of building jetties and
dredging channels meant a fierce competition for federal funds between various ports. Congress
and the Army Engineers required sufficient economic justification before spending money.
Although Brazos Santiago remained an important harbor on the south Texas coast throughout the
post-war period until 1904, there was increasing competition with Port Aransas/Corpus Christi and
Mexican ports, and with the railroad.
The Rio Grande Railroad between Point Isabel and Brownsville had not affected trade
at Braws Santiago; in fact, it depended on it. Despite the efforts of Kenedy and King to prevent
this railroad from competing with their Rio Grande steamboat, it went into operation in 1871. It
was ill-fated from the beginning. Storms in 1873 and 1874 caused serious damage, and in 1886;
so much storm damage was incurred that the railroad was taken out of commission and placed into
receivership (Reed 1941:467). Ferguson (1976:208) stated that it was actually the hurricane of
1888 that did $100,000 damage to the Rio Grande Railroad.
Even before the damaging storm of 1886, several events were orchestrated to
undermine the success of the line. King and Kenedy, failing in their efforts to pr~vent the railroad
from entering into Brownsville, re-established a Fast Freight service to compete with the railroad
and planned to bring another line into Brownsville that would bypass Braws Santiago altogether
and make the little Rio Grande line obsolete. They claimed the railroad rates were excessive and
engaged in an early day "price war" with their Fast Freight service to undermine the effectiveness
of the Rio Grande Railroad. In 1876, Kenedy, King and Uriah Lott built the Corpus Christi, San
Diego and Rio Grande narrow-gauge railroad from Corpus Christi to Laredo, bypassing
Brownsville altogether (Pierce 1917:150). Another railroad, however, would mark the demise of
the big merchants in Brownsville, as well as the demise of Braws Santiago as a major port. In

1882, the Mexican National Railroad was completed, running from Corpus Christi to Laredo and
on into Monterrey. It bypassed Brownsville, and indeed all of Cameron County, cutting it out of
the northern Mexican trade (Ferguson 1976:208).
Although competition with the railroads severely curtailed the use of Braws Santiago
Harbor, there continued to be at least one wharf on the island, and presumably a warehouse or
two, until about 1910. In 1880, a Life Saving Station was established near the former Braws
Lighthouse on the Gulf side of Braws Island. The lighthouse had been moved in the previous
year to a location offshore from the southwest comer of Padre Island (Figure 10). In the Annual
Reports of the U.S. Life Saving Service, this is generally referred to as the "Braws, Tex" station,
not to be confused with the Braws River Station. These records give some indication as to
shipping activity at Braws Santiago Harbor.
The keeper of each Life Saving Station maintained a journal of events involving his
crew. At the end of each fiscal year, a report of shipwrecks and rescues for the year was submitted
from each station and published as theAnnual Report. Several vessels were reported as total losses
in the records of the Braws Island Life Saving Station, including: the schooner Frank Hitchcock
and the steamer Morgan, both in December 1893 (U.S. Treasury Department 1894). Some later
reports of shipwrecks at the "Braws, Texas" station seem to refer to the station at the Braws
River Bar.
Repeated storm damage to the Life Saving Station on Braws Island finally forced its
removal to the bay side of the island in 1908 (Pierce 1917:140). The location is illustrated in a
map of Braws Santiago Pass dating from 1910 (Figure 19). Several structures, including the crew
quarters, a boat house and a wharf were associated with the station. A detailed plan of the Life
Saving Station complex, dating from 1909, was discovered at the National Archives (Figure 20).
One interesting feature of this plan is the precise location of an abandoned wharf. The Life Saving
Station illustrated in Figure 20 was totally destroyed by a hurricane on 16 October 1912. A
detailed account of this event and the associated destruction was published in the Annual Report
of the U.S. Life Saving Service for 1913. "The rebuilding of the station was undertaken without
delay and the work speedily concluded ..." (U.S. Treasury Department 1913:20-21).
Table 65 of each Annual Report lists places on the U.S. coast where vessels have
"stranded, etc." The information for these tables was supplied by the U.S. Customs Service but
published by the Life Saving Service. In the vicinity of "Brazos de Santiago, Tex" there were a
number of such incidents, including: 4 in 1875 (also 3 at Point Isabel in this year); 2 in 1881 (also
1 listed for Clark's Island and 3 for Point Isabel in this year); 2 in 1882; 3 each in 1884 and 1885;
1 in 1886; 2 in 1887; 1 in 1888; 4 in 1890; 2 each in 1891, 1892 and 1893; l (at Boca Chica) in
1894; 2 in 1896; 1 each in 1897 and 1898; 4 in 1900; 1 in 1901 (also 1 listed for Padre Island in
1901); 2 each in 1902 and 1903; 5 in 1904; 4 in 1905; 1 in 1906; and 1 in 1908. These records
continue through 1914 when the U.S. Coast Guard was formed; however, no other wrecks are
recorded. Unfortunately, vessel names and specific locations are not provided in Table 65 of the
Annual Reports. The number of wrecks in the vicinity of Braws Santiago fell off rapidly beginning
about 1906. It is likely more than coincidental that this is the year after the turning basin at Point
Isabel was closed by the sinking of the Luzon (Alperin 1977:141).

The River and Harbors Act of 1881 outlined a plan for the construction of parallel
jetties to protect the pass .at Brazos Santiago, cr"'.Bting the basis for a deepwater port.
Hydrographic survey work was conducted that same year by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.
The map produced by this survey is the first to show a quarantine station on the north end of
Brazos Island. U.S. Anny Engineers also conducted field investigations in 1881 to determine the
best location for the jetties. Major S.M. Mansfield submitted several tracings (of a pre-1881 map
base), showing proposed jetty locations, to the Engineers Department at Galveston on 28 June
1881 (copies of two Mansfield tracings are on file at EH&A). The jetties planned by Mansfield
in 1881 were oriented in a northeast-southwest direction and would have allowed a northeasterly
swell to directly enter the mouth of the jetties. Presumably it was planned that the currents set
up here during the winter months would keep the entrance channel across the bar scoured· to a
favorable depth.

The next year this plan was revised. The Anny Engineers conducted their own
hydrographic survey, completed between 11 and 19 March 1882. Mansfield submitted the results
of this survey, along with a revised plan of the Brazos Island jetties (copy on file at EH&A), in his
Annual Report to the Engineer Department on 30 June 1882. Funding had already been allocated
by Congress to build the jetties and work was begun quickly on the south jetty. The jetty was
completed in 1883, and in late June 1884, Mansfield had another hydrographic survey conducted
of the entrance channel and pass, presumably to assess the effects of the new jetty. The map
produced from that survey shows the solid line of the completed jetty extending into the Gulf (copy
on file at EH&A).
Funding was halted on the jetty project after completion of the south jetty (Alperin
1977:140). It is probably no coincidence that the Mexican National Railroad had bypassed the
Lower Rio Grande Valley in the previous year. Cancellation of the planned north jetty turned out
to be rather fortuitous for Congress, as, by 1887, the new south jetty had been washed completely
away. In July and August 1887, Major O.H. Ernst of the U.S. Corps of Engineers directed that
another hydrographic survey be conducted. The results (Figure 21) clearly show no vestige of the
former jetty. Ernst's map also shows several interesting features on Brazos Island, including old
wharves (located inland due to shoreline changes), a marine ways, the location ofthe 1880 Life
Saving Station, and the location of an uµidentified shipwreck.
Ernst also submitted to the Galveston Engineer Department comparative charts
prepared in that year that showed bathymetry and shorelines for five different years (each in a
different color of ink). One chart was a plan view of the pass and harbor bar; the other was a
comparison of vertical depth profiles for the same years at the location of the former south jetty.
The former was extremely useful in helping EH&A register various historic maps properly in the
absence of fixed landmarks on the· islands. Copies of Ernst's comparative charts are on file at
EH&A.
Following the failure of the 1880s jetty, the deepwater project at Brazos Santiago
remained at a virtual standstill for 20 years. The prosperous era of the steamboat was gone and
the newer and larger ocean-going ships bypassed Brazos Santiago for improved ports at Galveston
(Alperin 1977:43). During the last quarter of the century, only light-draft vessels from Galveston
and New Orleans visited the little port. The cessation of waterborne trade was compounded by
the establishment of railroad connections that excluded the Lower Rio Grande Valley from new

trade routes. The entire valley went into decline with the diminished trade and economic activity
(Lea 1957:536-541). The cpmpletion of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexican Railroad in 1904
finally brought economic life back to the valley by connecting Brownsville to northern cities and
the interior of Mexico. At the same time, renewed enthusiasm arose for a deepwater port.
In 1905, it was discovered that funds remained from the 1881 jetty project. The COE
used this money to dredge a channel from Brazos Santiago Pass across Laguna Madre to Point
Isabel. The project included a turning basin at the Point Isabel railroad wharf, which eliminated
the need for lightering (and for wharves) at Brazos Island. The channel to Point Isabel was 70 ft
wide and 10 ft deep and accommodated light steamers capable of crossing the bar at Brazos
Santiago (Alperin 1977:140). There were business interests in ·Brownsville, however, who were
opposed to plans for a deepwater port at Point Isabel, fearing that it might divert capital from their
new railroad. Others were skeptical of the plan's feasibility. Frank Pierce's account of port
activities at the time is tinged with doubt.
This fund was resurrected, the amount, $58,000 was promptly thrown
into the pockets of the dredge eompany which, in tum, excavated $58,000
of dirt and dumped it at other places in the bay from where it soon
found its way back to its original bed. As an additional stimulus to direct
the dirt back to its home, the Luzon (a steam lighter) was permitted to
sink at the end of the little wharf, to form a nucleus for a bar from
whence the channel might fill (Pierce 1917:127).

H

As a result of those actions, Pierce stated, "Brazos de Santiago bar and the once-busy little towns
within three miles of it, are now deserted" (Pierce 1917:127).

The sunken Luzon came to rest crosswise in the harbor so that it prevented freight
transfers and rendered the turning basin useless. Brazos Santiago was effectively put out of
commission. The sinking was an alleged act of sabotage by railroad interests to impair harbor
operations or eliminate its usefulness altogether. If it was, in fact, an intentional wreck, its goal
was certainly accomplished (Alperin 1977:141; Pierce 1917:127). The 1904 exeavation of the
channel had been a wasted effort.
Nevertheless, the concept of a deepwater port in the area still had its supporters. The
individual credited with sustaining the idea that the Lower Rio Grande Valley needed such a port
is Commodore Louis Cobolini. Cobolini came to Brownsville in 1907 and became a tireless
supporter of a deepwater harbor (Pierce 1917:124). He made a practice of recording and
compiling technical data for the purpose of convincing the Army engineers and government
officials that deep water was a practical endeavor and essential to the economic growth of the area
(Ferguson 1976:236).
Coincidental with the 1905 dredging, King Ranch interests helped spur the completion
of the St. L. B. & M. Railway through Brownsville. Many of those who supported the
St. L. B. & M. felt that a deepwater port would interfere with the success of the newly completed
railroad. The established port plan, at that time, involved dredging a channel from the end of the
narrow-gauge railroad at Point Isabel, through Brazos Santiago Pass into the Gulf (Ferguson
1976:247). Supporters of the new St. L. B. & M. made short work of that idea, however. They

129501910040

gained control of the little Rio Grande Railroad and promptly abandoned it to deteriorate beyond
repair (Alperin 1977:141).
The completion of the St. L.B. & M. Railroad, combined with the elimination of any
competition from the coast, gave Brownsville economic dominion in the area. Oil-bearing ships
from Tampico, forced to pass by Brazos Santiago, landed at Aransas Pass where the oil was then
shipped to Brownsville at considerable cost to consumers and considerable profit to those who
manipulated the situation (Alperin 1977:141).

The first solid effort to bring deep water to the Brownsville vicinity occurred in 1911
with the formation of the Brownsville Waterways Association. Louis Cobolini was a member of
the Board of Directors. Another proponent of the deepwater port was David O'Brien, an
Irishman, who succeeded in purchasing the abandoned Rio Grande Railroad in anticipation of
transporting cargo discharged at the proposed Brazos Santiago harbor. An alternative was
advanced by B. G. Stegman who proposed the construction of a ship channel that extended from
Brazos Santiago Pass to Brownsville where it terminated at a port. His 1912 survey essentially
followed the line of the present channel but his plan was not given full consideration at the time
(Ferguson 1976:249).
By 1918, the Army Corps of Engineers surveyed and mapped Brazos Santiago. The
District Engineer asked Mr. Cobolini to what extent the valley communities would assist in funding
the project. There were no wharves indicated on Braws Island at that time. Delegates from every
town in the valley met to discuss that issue in the summer of 1918. Among the improvements
recommended by the COE was a turning basin/anchorage area, 1,000 x 2,000 ft and 25 ft deep, in
the pass adjacent Brazos Island. No written evidence has been found to suggest this was ever
created; however, the presence of deep water in the pass, far south of the modem channel design
limits, indicates that a similar basin may have been dredged at a later date (U.S. House of
Representatives 1919).

In 1919, interested parties again appealed to the federal government for harbor
improvements. Congress approved a five-year experimental project to dredge a 5.5- x 122-m
channel through the pass, contingent upon local investment in the construction of a 5- x 30.5-m
channel from just inside the pass to the turning basin at Point Isabel. The local interests were also
required to maintain their part of the channe~ to rebuild the Rio Grande Railroad to standard
gauge and to furnish suitable terminal facilities (Rivers and Harbors Act 1919:3).
Dredging began inside the harbor first in 1923, and later outside. The outer bar at
Brazos Santiago posed many problems for engineers, just as it had for sea-going vessels for
hundreds of years.
The more abrupt slope of the sea bottom and the greater
proximity of deep water caused considerable difficulties. At one time, a
dredge that had worked its way in through the pass had to tum around
and re-dredge its way out (Alperin 1977:141).

Under the 1919 project, "two short stone dikes were completed [in the pass) in June
1927, and some dredging was done between them. However as the channel shoaled in, the
dredging was stopped in January 1928..." (U.S. House of Representatives 1939).
In 1928, the Brownsville Navigation District was formed. In that year, too, the
government appropriated $2.7 million for the project, but it wasn't until authorization by the Rivers
and Harbors Act of 1930 that the current BSC (Brazos Island Harbor) was finally begun, some 50
years after the initial plans were initiated (Berry 1988:2).
In January 1935, two 1,500-m jetties extending into the Gulf of Mexico were
completed at a cost of $2.6 million with the 27-km BSC dredged to a depth of 7.6 m and width of
30.5 m at the bottom, widening to 76.2 m at the water line. The channel extended from Braws
Santiago Pass to the turning basin which was 305 m wide and was also dredged to a depth of7.6 m.
A local newspaper account stated that the dirt taken from the channel was enough to cover 40 city
blocks to the height of Brownsville's tallest building, the El Jardin Hotel (Berry 1988:2; Reed
1941:762). A historian writing five years after the opening of the channel had a more pragmatic,
if less imaginative, description:

The turning basin itself is 5 miles below the city of Brownsville.
It is served by the Port Isabel & Rio Grande Railway. It has two regular
coastwise steamship lines. Foreign trade consists of citrus fruits and
vegetables, cotton, and petroleum from the Rio Grande Valley (Reed
1941:763).

I:
H

With the completion of the channel, attention was turned to the construction of
support facilities. Work began on wharves, docks and warehouses in the spring of 1935. The two
docks and two warehouses that were completed with the channel were built at a cost of $600,000
(Berry 1988:3). The long-awaited port was finally opened officially on 16 May 1936. Subsequent
amendments to the Braros Isabel Harbor project allowed for improvements over the years and the
channel was deepened by degrees until it reached its current depth of 11 m. The Water Resources
Bill of 1986 authorized further dredging to a depth of 12.8 m contingent upon a re-evaluation of
a COE study and, of course, further funding (Berry 1988:3).
Although Commodore Cobolini did not live to see the channel and port completed,
his tireless efforts to bring deepwater to the Lower Rio Grande Valley earned him the local
sobriquet, "Father of Deep Water" (Ferguson 1976:237).

Having understood that you were coming here I have delayed some time making a communication
to you on matters connected with the service of the department at this place which I now take the
liberty to do and regret exceedingly that circumstances are such as to prevent your extending your
trip as far at least as this place so as to enable you from personal inspection to see the wants of
the department. In the first place it is all important that as few vessels as possible drawing over
7 or 7 1/2 feet should be sent with stores as all of a larger class have to be lightered or discharged
outside and the weather is such at this season of the year on this coast that much of the time it is
impossible to lighter at all which imposes heavy demurrage on the department beside the expenses
of the lighters, therefore it would be much cheaper to pay considerably higher freights for vessels
of light draft. The wear and tear on our lighters is immense and frequently attended with great
risk. For the want of steamboats of the proper draft construction and strength I am obliged to
charter all the small vessels I can lay my hands on for the transportation of supplies to the river.
For that service we cannot use vessels drawing over 4 1/2 feet and the "Mentoria" is the only boat
I have of the proper model and draft, but she is so deficient in strength that I cannot send her over
the bars unless it is quite smooth. Four boats constructed somewhat on her model but substantially
built and well coppered could do all the carriage between this and the river, whereas I am now
obliged to use the fleet of small vessels mentioned in my report of yesterday, the "Mentoria" when
the weather will permit and nearly all the time the "Cincinnati", "Stevens", and "Thomson". The
three latter cannot take in over the Rio Grande bar over half a load and from what I learn of the
two iron steamers on their way from Savannah, they will do no better. Of our lighters, the "Sea"
is temporarily detained. The "Monmouth", the best we have had, and as good as any that can be
had, I expect every day will give out entirely. Her boiler is quite worn out and she has to lay by
frequently to patch it. Her guards are nearly broken down and her superstructure is very much
injured. I am decidedly of the opinion that she ought to go to New Orleans and undergo repairs.
I believe her hull to be in good order. The only thing I fear is that she may not be able to get to
New Orleans. Should she not be repaired, her commander, Capt. Baker, ought to be transferred
to some other boat, he being one of the best men for the business that can be obtained. The
"Augusta" is getting old in service and I apprehend will not last long. The "Stevens" and
"Thomson" do tolerable good service lightering when they can be spared from running to the river.
As for the boats on the river they are not under my control, and I do not often see them, but I do
think there is at this time hardly a single one there or here suited for the services they ought to
perform. The river boats are too frail, have not sufficient power, and many of them draw too
much water. In regard to the boats running between here and New Orleans, I think it would be
much cheaper and better in every point of view to employ only such as can cross this bar, and as
for the "Neptune" and "Florida", I do not think either of them fit for the service in any respect.

L

n

The ''Yazoo" is principally employed in running between here and Point Isabel. This is necessary
in consequence of the General Hospital, clothing and ordnance depots being there. I should have
mentioned that I have to pay the small vessels running to the river from ten to thirty dollars per
day.

or ten feet water, and when in decidedly the best harbor on this part of the coast. The saving in
transportation alone, aside from the expenses of the Brasos depot, would be twenty or thirty
thousand dollars per month. Will you be so good as to see Col. Medill and have this question
brought before the Dept.
I suspect that some speculations are afloat at Uncle Sam's expense, Cities built, Rail Roads etc.

Sir:

A copy of a letter addressed by you (in your official capacity) to the hon. Geo. Fries M.C. bearing
date 16 February 1848 has been sent to me by the Quarter Master General ordering a statement
of facts on the points alluded to by you. This I shall do by no broad assertions, but from the
evidence of men whose experience and observations, for a long period of time, ought to give, at
least, some idea of the true nature of the case.
It is a well known fact, established by all English, Spanish and French Surveys of the coast of the
"Gulf of Mexico" from the Sabine to the Island of Lobos (some distance S.E. of Tampico) that the
bars at the entrance of harbors, are composed entirely of quick sand. This is corroborated by our
own surveys and the observation of all navigators. It is an admitted fact that upon quick sand no
permanent work can be made. It is also an admitted fact, that there is no permanency of channel
on quick sand bars. Such is the case at the Mouth of the Rio Grande, where very recently the
channel has changed considerably. Here, where the average depth of water is almost double, the
channel has changed, within the last twenty days nearly or quite half a mile.

Now, what sort of boat or machine, yet heard of, could do what you say can be done on the Rio
Grande bar, where the average depth of water is scarcely over four feet and the channel constantly
shifting. If a boat kept on the bar (where is there one that would live in the breakers?) could do
any good, the work of today would be undone tomorrow, thus adding a daily bill of expense to the
twenty or thirty thousand dollars (one fourth the last sum is about the true expense) you set down
as the cost of transportation per month from this to the Rio Grande Depot. You might as well
attempt to bail out the ocean as, by any human agency, hope to improve navigation over a shifting
quicksand bottom; it never has, nor never can be done. I must believe that you expressed your real
opinion to the Hon. Mess. Medill & Fries, but as it was an erroneous one, I trust you will correct
it, as otherwise, these gentlemen might take such action in the premises, as to cause much
unnecessary expense to the government.

I

I

1

If the improvements you suggest could be made, the Q.M. at the Mouth of the Rio Grande, has
strangely neglected his duty in not reporting on the same to the Chief of his Department, than
whom, no officer is more anxious to economise his branch of the Service, and expects from his
subalterns a constant application of their energies in a like effort.
I deem it the duty of a good citizen and particularly that of an Officer of the Government, when
he suspects a misapplication of "Uncle Sam's" money to say where his suspicions rest, that the
innocent may not be confounded with the guilty.

If cities are being built, Rail Roads, etc. with Government money for individual profit, the hon.
gentlemen should know who are implicated. They can be no other than public disbursing o[ficers.
My opinions regarding the occupancy of the Depot here and at the Mouth of the Rio Grande, as

well as Rail Roads, etc. etc. are on file at the Quarter Master General's office. Major Anderson
can, no doubt, answer for his acts.

Qr.Masters Office
Mo. Rio Grande, 18 June 1848
Major:
In reply to your letter of 14 [17?] inst. on the subject of the Bar at the Mouth of the Rio Grande,
I have. the honor to enclose the questions proposed to and answered by my Pilot which I think
[illegible] on the point upon which you ask to be informed and I place such confidence in the
[illegible] and capacity of Coombs the Pilot that I unhesitatingly adopt his opinion as my own on
the subject. I was all the time of the opinion that [illegible] boats might improve the channel, but
upon conversing with practical men, I am convinced that in consequence of the frequent changes
of the channel which often take place in twenty four hours, that no permanent improvement could
be made. The channel is changed by a change of wind and by the rise and fall of the river, it is
on the north side, then on the south and again in the middle. I do not recollect hearing Lt.
Webster Topo. Engineer express his opinion, he certainly never referred to or suggested any plan
of improvement.

'

As to any building of cities or rail roads at Uncle Sam's expense, for private benefit I have heard
nothing of it, and can most conscientiously declare I never did attempt or think of attempting any
thing of the kind myself, nor do I believe any other disbursing officer known to me has.

/. .!'

I am very sure that could I have devised any system of improving the navigation of the bar, that
might have saved the expense of the Brazos Depot, I should have communicated it to you as well
as the Department at Washington, and should no doubt have [secured?] the hearty cooperation of
yourself as well as the Dept. in any [illegible] plan·s, but to ... my ... if objection was given by practical
men, that I did not attempt to propose any plan.

General:
Since I last had the honor to address you, I have been busily engaged in carrying out your orders
concerning the public property at this Depot. All the ordnance, medical stores, and clothing has
been shipped, and very nearly all the Qr. Ms. property, that in my opinion ought to be sent at
present. I have thought it proper to reserve a supply sufficient to supply the line (or the [lesser?]
part of it) for 12 months, as well as to meet contingencies. It will be an easy matter to [illegible]
still further. Major Anderson has a surplus of property which I will order shipped in a few days
or as soon as I have more vessels. I am sending to Fort Brown all the Ware Houses that can be
spared and selling off the small houses at fair prices. The quantity of unsound property at the
Depot is so [illegible] that I have concluded, instead of having a public sale, to dispose of it
privately, in this way better prices can be obtained. Major Anderson has instructions to dispose
of any public property at his Depot, at private sale, when fair prices can be had. I think it will be
difficult to dispose of the boats, but as they are laid up at a trifling expense, it may be well not to
force them off. I have now the last vessel on the ways requiring repairs, and will be [illegible] to
turn over all water craft in good order. There is a prospect of disposing of the iron boat "De
Rossel". I ask $20,000, she is a very fine vessel.
The first cargo of coal from Tampico arrived today. Capt. Carr informs me that this will be some
60 or 70 schooner loads, it shall be got up as soon as possible. It can be disposed of here
advantageously.
As a large portion of the Qr. Ms. property going out of the country consists of harness, chains, axes

and such other articles as would be valuable in fitting out expeditions, I have suggested to Major
Tompkins the [illegible] of sending a quantity to Saint Louis, perhaps it would be better than to
sell and than maybe have to buy again.

u

Col. Kinney of Corpus Christi has intimated that he would like to purchase all the wagons left
(about 500). I will make him a proposition. If he will give a fair price I will sell all that can be
spared. This description of wagon is not saleable in the States.

General:
I have to report that on the morning of the 19th a gale commenced blowing from the N.E. and
continued (with almost constant rain) up to the night of the 23rd, when the wind shifted to the W.
and the weather became more settled.
During the gale the water rose about 13 inches over the land immediately in front of the wharves,
surrounding all the public buildings and extending back to the sand hills, but no damage (worth
mentioning) was sustained. This morning the water commenced receding and in a day or two, will
no doubt be confined within its natural limits .

The U.S. Sehr. "Capt. Page" (from Tampico, with coal) anchored in the offing at the
commencement of the gale, and rode it out until the 22nd, when she was [illegible] on shore about
one mile to the southward. She will be lost. I am saving whatever can be got from her. Masts,
spars, sails etc. etc. I am satisfied the Captain did all that man could do under the circumstances.
No lives lost.
During the storm, means were taken to secure the safety of all citizens, and I believe in no event
would there have been any loss of life.
On the sand hills (where the Barracks are situated) there was perfect safety, even if the water had
risen 15 feet. They are about half a mile from the public landing, and in my opinion, can be made
entirely secure against ordinary casualties.
The storm was a terrific one, and I am happy to report so little disaster from its effects, when at
one time seemed to threaten great damage. I have now as good an opinion of Brazos, as of any
of its neighbors.

I have the honor to report that I have reduced the wages of all clerks in this District to $75 per
month. I have retained at this Depot but one clerk, one store keeper, (at $60.00 per month), eight
teamsters, fifteen laborers, two blacksmiths, 15 ship carpenters and three house carpenters. The
ship carpenters could not be reduced as the steamboats Monmouth and Stevens are on the ways
undergoing repairs. I have made similar reductions at Point Isabel and the Mouth of the River.
I have nearly removed the quarters and barracks from Mr. Dobbin's land. The quarters I have sent
to Point Isabel for the commanding officer; the barracks will be sent to Clay Davis' Landing. In
the course of ten days all the Quartermaster's and Commissary stores will be removed into the
large storehouse, and all the buildings removed from that portion of Mr. Dobbin's land which he
requested in his letter to the Hon. Secretary of War, dated August l, 1848. That portion of the
wharf required by him is also ready to be turned over to him or his agent. If his title is good, I
am ready to make a settlement with him for the post, and a lease for the future as soon as he or
his agent makes his appearance. The Light Company having been ordered to take post at Clay
Davis' Landing, I sent up last week on the "Corvette" one of the stables at Fort Brown. The
buildings at the Mouth of the River and Brazos, no longer required, will be nearly sufficient to
quarter all the officers and troops at the new posts. By adding some new lumber and shingles, and
furnishing stoves, they can be rendered quite comfortable and [... able].

I shall send today on the steamboat De Rossell a full load of new Quartermasters stores to New

expected. The schooner Susan will leave tomorrow morning with a part of the surplus clothing
for Phila. The remainder not being sufficient for a schooner load, I have thought best to send to
New Orleans. There are about 130 (illegible]. The Norther last Saturday re-opened Boca Chica.
It was very severe and carried away one wharf, and injured all more or less. Some 300 sacks of
oats were carried away from one of the platforms during the gale. The water came up around the

Having, agreeably to your instructions, presented all my accounts for settlement, I now have the
honor to report the operations of the Quarter Masters Department at Brazos Santiago,
commencing on the 24th March, 1847 (when I relieved the late Capt. Still) and ending on the 31st

This Depot was the great channel through which passed the troops and supplies for the Army
operating on the upper line and from which was embarked the returning Army, munitions of war,
etc. The accumulation of property, therefore, was immense, and its protection a matter of serious
and anxious consideration. My predecessor had commenced erecting suitable warehouses, and I
deemed it my duty to continue until all the stores (subject to injury from exposure) were safely
sheltered. This work was done with as much speed and economy as possible, and within a few
months, houses were built capable of holding all the stores then exposed on the beach (under cloth
covers) or to arrive. The property of the Qr. Mst. Dept. appears to have suffered scarcely any
injury, that of the Commissariat, none other than might have been expected from exposure to the
action of the sun, in a low latitude. Suitable buildings were also erected for officers and soldiers
quarters, mechanics, and others in Government service, and for work shops, etc. Since the War,
many of these houses have been removed to Fort Brown, leaving however, quite a sufficient
numlier for all purposes, under the peace establishment, should it be retained as a Depot.
For giving greater facility to receiving and shipping property, etc. and to save demurrage (for which
not a dollar was paid to any vessel arriving after I took charge) it became necessary to construct
wharves, this was done in a very cheap manner, by using old vessels, no longer fit for service. As
many as seven vessels could be accomadated [sic] at the same time.
A cheap breastwork (of Palmetto logs) was made along the beach in front of the Public property,
which had a good effect in protecting the shore from the wash of the sea.
The frequent occasion to repair vessels, and the great expense of sending them abroad for that
purpose, made it necessary to establish a ship yard. A set of ways were built, and all the
appertenances necessary for repairing vessels were procurred, this was likewise done at the Mouth
of the Rio Grande, there also, were established a machine shop and foundery, thus giving the
means of making almost every repair required by either steam or sail vessels, and a number were
repaired at an immense saving to the Government, and greatly to the convenience of the
Department.
The Transportation Branch of the Department, both by land and water, fully met the demands of
the service, though sometimes the vessels were not exactly of the character I would have desired
for the transportation of troops, this however could not be avoided, as the vessels employed for
this Depot, were necessarily of that class having reference more to capacity and light draught than
to personal comfort. This branch of the service deserves more credit than has been given to it.
At the commencement of the War there were very few vessels (particularly steamers) suitable. for
transporting troops and supplies over the dangerous bars at the entrance of all the harbors on the

I

whole coast except Vera Cruz, but the energies of the Department soon overcame this difficulty,
and in a very short time, had the means of doing the incalculable labor required of it on the Gulf
of Mexico. The most serviceable sailing vessels for Brazos, were the schooners built at
Philadelphia. They could not be improved upon. The propellors, though not to be compared with
the side wheel steamers as sea vessels, yet, in the main, the most of them did very good service,
and lost confidence more from comparison than from desert, at least as far as I had any thing to
do with them. I had the honor to advise you from time to time both during and after the War, of
the embarkation of troops from Brazos for other ports in the United States and Mexico. They all
reached their destination in good time and without accident. Very few vessels were chartered by
me for any purpose and those at low rates, as will appear from reports previously made.
It is a remarkable fact (to which your attention may not have previously been called) that in all the

transportation of troops, to and from Mexico, not a single life was lost by shipwreck, and I am
confident that less than Two percent would cover all losses of property from same cause.
The means of transportation from Brazos to the Rio Grande and Point Isabel were sufficiently
ample for all purposes. On the Rio Grande the Government boats, under the immediate direction
of Majr. Anderson Qr. Ms., done great service, and under his efficient management fully met all
demands for transportation with promptitude.
Steam vessels were kept at Brazos for towing over the bar and at no time (unless during very bad
weather) was public business suspended for want of means. The land transportation between
Brazos and the Rio Grande was always effective.

I
I

Within the time I had charge of this Depot 1155 vessels (brigs, barks, schooners, etc.) were towed
in and out of the harbor, without serious accident to more than three schooners, neither of which
belonged to the Government. I account for this by the change made in the Pilotage system (Viz)
dispensing with the services of the State Pilots and requiring the Masters of the Tow Boats to
perform that duty, thereby making them directly responsible, and saving a very large amount of
pilot fees. This act, with· that of removing citizens houses from grounds indispensable for
public ... [page of letter missed when copying] ... 629 mules (selected) at an average of $17.23 per
head. I also purchased the steamer "Oreline" to take the place of the "Yazoo" (requiring a
thorough overhauling) as a lighter to Point Isabel. After performing good service both in the bay
and on the Rio Grande, she was inspected and considered not worth repairing. Her engines were
sent to New Orleans for sale. I also purchased the schooner "Equity" for $2500 to take the place
of the "Susan" (one of the Philad. schooners) as a lighter across the bar, the latter vessel being far
more useful for other purposes.
Among other of my receipts and issues of public property may be named 560,786 bushels oats,
115,940 bushels corn, 5,311,714 pounds hay, 86,658 barrels stone coal. Of the latter I turned over
to Major Chapman 19,294 barrels, to which large additions (of good quality) would be made from
Tampico.
Of public money I received and disbursed (as per vouchers) $634,851.18
An abundant supply of good water was obtained from the Rio Grande by the returning wagon
trains, to which, (with their comfortable quarters) may be attributed the good health of the
employees of the Department, not over eight or ten having died, out of the many employed, within
a time of nearly two years.
I would respectfully suggest the propriety of keeping the ship yards and ways in order and retaining
the foundery and machine ship if the the vessels at Brazos and on the Rio Grande are to continue

in service on Government account. If they are to be disposed of, the presence of these works
would no doubt enhance their value with purchasers.
The bridge across the Boca Chica can be kept in good order at a trifling expense and will at all
times be a great convenience.
The Depot at the Mouth of the Rio Grande, being under my supervision, but immediately under
the direction of Majr. Nath. Anderson Qr. Ms., I deem it my duty and take much pleasure in
stating that he conducted the business confided to him in a manner highly creditable to himself and
on the most economical scale for the interest of the Government.

The business of the Depot at Point Isabel (also under my supervision) though inconsiderable, was
satisfactorily conducted.

[i

To Col. Hunt and Major Tompkins, and the officers acting with them at New Orleans, I am greatly
indebted for the prompt manner in which all my requisitions were supplied, thereby enabling me
at all times to meet promptly, similar calls along the line.
Besides performing all the current duties of the Qr. Ms. Department at Brazos, and having charge
of the clothing depot for some months, I [illegible] all the out door operations, thereby saving the
necessity of employing men at high prices, for that purpose. Although these duties were very
arduous and done for nearly the whole time without an assistant, I trust the performance of them
will give satisfaction.

General:

I have the honor to report that a violent storm prevailed here yesterday which caused considerable
damage to public and private property. The fence around the Depot and the stable were blown
down. The "Monmouth" dragged her anchors and went ashore, but was got off without any
damage. Every private vessel in the harbor went ashore, except a Mexican schooner which sank
at her anchors in 20 or 30 feet of water. She was loaded for Tampico with 400 bales of cotton
goods.

I.

The damage to the steamer "Herrera" (the old "William R. McKee") is estimated at $2000. Several
private dwellings were blown down. About one half of the bridge over Boca Chica was carried
away. As the expense of repairing it will be considerable, and as what little crossing the
Department will hereafter require, can be done by fording, or in a flat boat, I would respectfully
recommend that the bridge be taken up and the Palmetto logs sent to Point Isabel.

H'

One small building at Point Isabel, used as Quartermaster's office was blown down during the
storm. Two persons were killed at Point Isabel by the falling of buildings.

I was a resident of Matamoros, Mexico for several years and up to the month of April
or May 1837, and am aware of the fact that during the latter portion of that time the landing of
Brazo de Santiago at the northern end of Brazos Island was a Mexican Military Post. In the
summer of 1836 while Genl. Santa Ana's campaigne in Texas was in progress an engineer in the
Mexican Service (Colonel Michelli, I think) was sent from Matamoros to the aforesaid landing to
superintend the construction of a battery; which, as I understood, was done by order of Genl.
Fernandes, then commanding the military department to which Matamoros belonged. The battery
was planted on the northern or terminating point of the sand hills which was then near the Brazo
Inlet, and commanded the entrance to the harbor, as well as the village which then stood where
the U.S. Depot has since been placed. The work consisted of a timber platform on which several
guns were mounted with a magazine contiguous. In April or May 1837 I remained at the Brazo
de Santiago two or three weeks before embarking and, at that time, the usual routine of a military
post appeared to be observed. About one company of troops was usually on duty there, though
the force was occasionally [illegible]; and at the time I embarked the commandante of the post was
a field officer. I do not know how long the aforesaid work continued to be garrisoned, but am of
opinion that it was intended for a permanent military post when it was constructed. It was, as I
have learned, destroyed by an inundation in 1844. At the time of my embarking and for several
years previously a Revenue Station, connected with the Custom House of Matamoros, had been
kept up at Brazo de Santiago and buildings there were at different times occupied for Revenue
purposes, but whether owned by the government or rented I do not recollect.
Witness my hand the day and date above written.

I have the. honor to report that the hulk of the propeller "Colonel Stevens" has been so long
exposed to the weather, and is in such a condition, many of her planks having been taken off some
two years since, that she is not worth repairing by the United States. Neither would she bring
anything if offered for sale. The only use that can be made of her, is to stop up the holes with
rough pine plank, put her in position, scuttle, and make a wharf or rather pier head of her. And
I am much in want of a hulk for this purpose. My only wharf boat having gone to pieces during
the recent severe Northers. The position in which I wish to place her will greatly protect the depot
from the action of the water, and particularly the coal pile, during Northers. I have carefully
examined the hulk with several old sea captains and Mr. Murray, my master ship carpenter, and
they fully agree with me as to her present value.

Maj. W.W. Chapman,
Dear Sir,
Our District Court has been in session for several days and among other business disposed of was
the case of Leonard Dobbin vs. yourself, and the intervention suit of Wm. Patterson vs. yourself
and Dobbin, for the recovery of Brazos Island now in possession of the United States.

l1

We filed your answer with the necessary pleas in both cases, at length, setting forth our grounds
of defence, so as to take the same to the Supreme Court of the United States by writ of error.
It seems that after our defence was fully developed, the opposing counsel found that they could
not sustain their cases and accordingly dismissed them at their own costs. We were thoroughly
prepared for trial, but as the matter now stands the cases are dismissed, and you need give yourself
no further trouble in relation to them. The grounds we took in defending these suits were in the
main those suggested to you by Genl. Jesup in the communica~ion, a copy of which you had the
kindness to furnish us.
Hoping that our action in these cases meets your approbation.
We remain

Sir:
I have the honor to submit for your consideration the following report of the result of the surveys
on this coast, as far as they have been completed up to the present time, committed to my charge
by the Dept. letter of Sept. 28, 1852.
I. Bars

[

The bars on the coast of Texas from Pass Cavallo to the mouth of the Rio Grande being of the
same nature, acted upon by the same causes & subject to the same changes, I have determined to
describe them generally. I give the conclusions at which I have arrived as to their improvement,
before taking up the subject of the Harbors to which they belong, in this last connexion [sic] will
be found the depth of water, etc. on each bar. In my letter of Jan. 13 I stated what I then
supposed to be their general nature. A subsequent close examination of all has fully confirmed
my impressions. The bottom of the Gulf along the whole coast deepens very gradually, and is of
sand until you reach a depth of about 7 1/2 fathoms, when blue clay is found. Not extending
directly across the mouths of their outlets, but from points of the shore above & below, in a curved
form, out to sea, these bars are so situated as to be entirely exposed to the action of heavy storms,
& great changes are usually found to have occurred during their prevalence. Important changes
in their position have also arisen from the constant cutting away and filling up of the shores. From
the best information I can obtain it appears that the depth of water on the bars has been gradually
decreasing since they first became well known to our navigators. They are all of a quicksand
formation, hard as rock to the touch of the sounding pole, but acted upon with extraordinary
facility by the water.
On some of them, especially the Brazos Santiago Bar, it is impossible to maintain buoys for any
length of time in the same position, their anchors soon working their way through the sand, &
dragging them down.
It is difficult to imagine anything more changeable than are all these bars. The channels over them
are, literally, constantly shifting, & cannot be depended on from day to day. Neither does the
position of the channel appear to have any connexion [sic] with the outward current. That is to
say, it is as often in a position where, judging from the conformation of the shores within, the
action of the outward current is most indirect, circuitous & weak, as when it is most direct &
strong.

The positions, etc. of the bars & their channels appear to depend entirely upon the action of
storms & prevailing winds, & not upon any current arising from the rivers emptying into the
interior bays, for instance, the next best bar to Pass Cavallo (with regard to depth of water) is that
at Brazos Santiago, at the outlet of a bay that has no stream emptying into it, while the worst is

I

I

I

I

I

at the mouth of the Rio Grande. In fact the rivers are so small & the bays so large that it is
usually difficult to perceive any effect arising from the current alluded to.

I-_'i_
--1

From these facts, & the repeated occasions I have had to experience the extreme roughness of the
water on these bars, I regard it as impossible to improve any of them by dredging, scraping or any
similar means, for, supposing that means may be found to overcome the difficulty of working under
such circumstances, & that the channel were actually deepened to the required extent, it is certain
that the same causes which now operate in so constantly shifting the position of the channel would
almost immediately fill up any new one made by artificial means. It now remains to be considered
whether it is possible to improve the bars by contracting, or changing the direction of the channel,
by means of dikes, jetties, etc., etc.
The passes at the mouth of the Rio Grande, Brazos Santiago, Corpus Christi & Aranzas have each
but a single outlet, all exceedingly narrow, & none admitting any further decrease in width.
The only possible application of dikes, in these cases, would be to prolong the walls of the outlet
until they reached a point very near the present position of the bar, in order to concentrate upon
one spot the whole action of whatever outward current there might be. The ultimate effect of this
would undoubtedly be the formation of a new bar outside, and that too at no distant period. The
immediate effect would, by no means, certainly be favorable, & the new outlet would be liable to
be closed up by heavy storms (subject to-breaking out again), as is now frequently the case with
small inlets on the coast of Florida. With regard to the project for improving Pass Cavallo, by
closing the Pelican Island channel, to which my attention has been called by the Dept., I have,
since my letter of Jany. 13, given it an attentive consideration. With the proposed dike constructed
the situation of affairs would be analagous to that now existing at the other passes, & I see no
reason for believing that the strength of the new current would be much, if at all greater, than that
at Aranzas [sic], or at Corpus Christi Pass. Were the strength of the current increased it would
exert itself in cutting away more rapidly the point of Matagorda Island, where the Light House now
stands, & thus enable itself to spread out still more than it now does before reaching the bar.
So far as it is possible to foresee the effect of so uncertain an operation, & judging principally from
what I have observed at the passes in general, I think that were any appreciable effect produced
by closing the opening in question, it would be lateral rather than vertical. As far as regards the
"twenty feet" channel expected to be obtained, one of 100' might be looked for with equal
confidence.
I therefore give it as my opinion that it is not advisable to attempt any improvement of the bars
mentioned in this report, as such attempts would, in all probability, result in a very great waste of
money & of time, without any reasonable prospect of effecting any improvement.
I will close this subject by stating that, in every instance, the foundation of any structure attempted
would be on quicksand, & that the difficulties of construction would be very great. Were anything
attempted at Pass Cavallo beyond closing the Pelican Isl. channel, it would involve the revetment
of about 4 miles of shore & the construction of more than 5 miles of dike.
II. Harbor of Brazos Santiago
The bar of this harbor is probably the roughest on the coast of Texas. During the fall, winter &
spring it may be depended on for a depth of 8', it being seldom necessary for vessels of this
draught to wait outside more than 24 hours, except on account of the roughness of the bar.
During the summer the water is sometimes as low as 6 1(2' to 7'. The anchorage outside is
excellent in 7 1(2 to 8 fathoms, the bottom of blue clay. The best anchorage is in this depth, with

D
II
r;

the Beacon on Padre Island bearing west. In less than 7 1/2 fathoms the bottom is of quicksand.
A steam tug can usually be had to tow vessels over the bar. The harbor within is quite small, but
is amply large for all the trade now carried on through it. The greatest depth of water in the
harbor is 22'. There is no obstacle in the way of vessels between the bar & the inside anchorage.
As well as I can learn, & my own recollection leads me to the same conclusion, the harbor is

gradually filling up, so that it may be necessary at some future day to improve it by dredging, but
this period will be so remote that it is unnecessary to make provision for it at present. The
channel from Brazos to Point Isabel can be depended upon for 3 1/2', these is usually more. It is
ample for the lighters running between the two places, & there exists no necessity for any
improvement at present.
The bar at the mouth of the Rio Grande is, as has been already stated, of the same formation as
the others: it averages about 4'. When there I found 3 1/2' & was informed by the pilots that it
is often still lower. On one or two occasions there have been 7 1/2' after violent storms, but it
almost at once resumed its usual depth. This bar shifts even more than that at Brazos Santiago.

Government stores & I have to request some instructions with regard to paying the salvage on the
same. The Government as a shipper of course, is governed by the same laws that other shippers
are, & must pay the salvage or have its goods sold at public sale, but I should like to have some
special instructions in the case, or at least to know what has heretofore been the custom of
disbursing officers in similar cases. This is the first time that such accounts have been presented

Memoir of history and progress of the surveys of Pass Cavallo, Corpus Christi, & Brazos Santiago
harbors and the San Antonio River.
These works were placed in charge of Capt. G.B. McClellan, Corps of Engineers, by orders from
Eng. Dept. Sept. 28th, 1852.
The survey of Pass Cavallo, Corpus Christi & Brazos Santiago harbors were completed and
reported upon by Capt. McClellan, who was relieved Apl. 25th 1853 by Lt. W.H. Stevens, Corps
of Engineers.
In regard to the bars surveyed by Capt. McClellan he reports it is not advisable to attempt any
improvement; the character of the bars being such that no improvement would be permanent.
The inland navigation from Matagorda Bay to Corpus Christi he reports should be improved. The
improvements for this would also open the communication to the mouth of the San Antonio River.
The principal obstructions are [illegible] and mud flats, to be removed by dredging. Capt.
McClellan estimates the cost at $11,739.00.
Improvement of San Antonio River: This river is not navigable above the town of Goliad. Below
that point some obstructions should be removed.. The falls at Goliad, Raft at Fagan's Island, and
overhanging timber being the principal ones. Cost of removal of these estimated at $19,300.00.

Col.
Brazos Santiago during the past few months has been visited by several heavy gales which have
done considerable damage and makes it necessary that something should be done for the
protection of the public buildings at that place. Ten days ago a heavy N.E. gale carried away nearly
all the piles which supported the wharf and it is now necessary that it should be entirely rebuilt.
From the fact that wooden piles cannot be driven in the quick sand of the Brazos, I would
recommend that the iron screw pile should be used instead unless the expense should forbid it.
What they would cost I am unable at present to say, but I have written to Lieut. Stevens at
Galveston for information on the subject. I think however that the cost will not be great and their
use would in the end prove economical.
The water has encroached upon one of the storehouses and a row of piles will have to be run in
front of it to prevent its being overthrown [?]. These however can be of wood and worked in by
hand. I have a sufficient number on hand and it will only be necessary to employ a few Mexicans
to do the work. To make these necessary repairs will require an outlay of about fifteen hundred
dollars.

I have received through Col. A.C. Myers A.Q.M. your instructions with regard to the wharf at this
place. There can be obtained here an abundance of Palmetto logs for its repair but I most
respectfully suggest that iron piles would be superior in every respect particularly on the score of
economy provided that their first cost was not too exorbitant. This wharf has been built over
repeatedly & at considerable cost & will have to be renewed as often as built on wooden piles.
From the nature of the bottom which is quick sand it is impossible to drive wooden piles & it is
necessary to work them down by hand & consequently the piling soon washes out or the sand is
washed away from around it. On the contrary iron piles can easily be screwed into a firm bed &
when once placed will last for all time. The only question is as to the first cost which I presume
can be but little over the price of wrought iron in the rough as there is but very little work on the
pile. Before commencing these repairs I have thought it proper to state the objections to the
wooden piles & suggest a substitute.

permission had been granted, on certain conditions therein stated, to the Light House Board to
place a Beacon light on the cupola of the Quarter Master's warehouse at Brazos Santiago, and
having submitted it to Major General Twiggs, commanding the Department of Texas, he has
directed me to state that he has objections to the measure proposed, inasmuch as he believes that
notwithstanding the precaution of having access to the Beacon by means of an outside stairway,
the property to be stored in the building will be insecure and that the subject has become more
important, of which you could not have been aware, by the increase of responsibility entailed upon
the agent in charge of the building by the large addition of public property to be stored at Brazos
Santiago under his Department order No. 1 dated the 5th inst., consequent upon the abandonment
of Fort Brown, Ringgold Barracks and Fort Mcintosh.
I respectfully await your further instructions in the matter and would ask whether any measures
have been taken by the Department to render necessary my intervention to check the proposed
erection of the beacon light.

LOTS FOR SALE IN BRAZOS CITY!
This town is situated upon the north side of the Harbor of the Brazos St. Iago, in Cameron
county, Texas, and directly upon the Gulf of Mexico.
All of the merchandise destined for the valley of the Rio Grande, as also that in
route for Matamoros, Reynosa, Camargo, Mier, Monterey, Saltillo, San Luis Palisi,
Durango, Zacatecas, and other portions of Mexico, is necessarily landed at the Brazos St.
Iago, and the rapidly increasing trade at this point indicates that Brazos City is destined to
be the largest city on the Gulf of Mexico.
Its elevated position puts it beyond the possibility of an overflow, and its natural
advantages as to Harbor, and its contiguity to a rich country, where thirty millions of dollars
of merchandise are annually sold, and which necessarily enters the Harbor, in connection
with its healthfulness, offer to capitalists greater inducements for investment than can be
found in any city in the South. The undersigned being the joint and sole owners of Brazos
City, are prepared to sell or lease lots upon accommodating terms.

I have the honor herewith to enclose, a "Requisition" or "Estimate" of funds required for the repair
of the public buildings and fences at the Brazos. I also enclose a plan of the buildings and grounds
made by me a few days ago, it will be observed that the greater part of the estimate is for enclosing
the grounds with a good fence. The fence is more than half gone, in fact there is no fence on the
sides marked R.S. I am aware that the extent of ground marked on the plan as being enclosed is
greater than is required for use at present. But should Brazos ever be required as a large Depot
it would be true economy to enclose the ground as marked in the plan, as there is a person signing
himself "John V. Singer, agent for Johana Shaw" who lays claim to the entire island, Depot
included, and should the fence not be made I think it more than probable that he or some person
holding under him will endeavor to build so near the Depot buildings as to make it necessary
either to rent from them or enter a suit to remove them, which in either case cost much more than
the $490.90 required. Whilst I was at the Brazos, Singer or some person acting for him surveyed
the island, Government property included. In reference to the other repairs, store house, etc. I
deem it unnecessary to say more, than that the buildings were carefully inspected by me, and their
condition found to be such as to require the material estimated for their repair. I have estimated ·
for hinges of copper and brass, as the salt air soon destroys iron. Pine lumber of the description
can be purchased at the Brazos for $30.00 M. and Cedar ot Cypress for posts at 7 cents per foot.
I think the cedar or cypress preferable at the difference of price. The cedar posts put up by Major
Chapman are yet sound whilst the pine put up but a few years (3 or 4) are entirely eaten off by
the worms. The other materials included in the "Requisition• can be purchased and delivered at
the Brazos for the prices at which they are charged in the requisition. I have purposely omitted
any estimate for labor thinking it might be done by "extra duty men."

I have received your letter of the 22nd ultimo enclosing a plan of the public grounds of buildings
theron at Brazos Santiago and an estit)late of funds for repairs of buildings, fences, etc. Before
any action can be taken in respect of your suggestions I ·desire that you will report without delay
whether the improvements in question are absolutely necessary in connection· with the present
mode of transporting supplies received from the New Orleans steamers at Brazos and destined for
Fort Brown, or if it is not better to dispense with the depot at the former place altogether. I am
led to make this inquiry by a conversation which I have had with Colonel Lee commanding the
Department, who represents that there are several obstacles to the economical transportation of
stores from Brazos to Fort Brown by wagons, such as the difficulty at Boca Chica Creek, a bayou,
and the objection to landing stores at Brazos wharf. You will please state the comparative cost
by the land route and by steamers round by the Rio Grande to Fort Brown, supposing the former
route is aided by a good wharf at Brazos and a bridge or flat boat established at Boca Chica. Is
it necessary that supplies should be landed at Brazos and have you sufficient sotrehouses room for
all the stores that may be needed for the Rio Grande posts at Fort Brown? Why has insurance
been denied upon stores shipped for Brownsville if they are to be landed at Brazos? If there is
no need of the public occupation of Brazos, state your reasons in full on that point and upon any
other you may entertain upon both routes. I have confidence in your judgment and will thank you
to confer with me freely.

Major,

'

Your letter of the 18th inst. in reference to the Depot at the Brazos and the transportatin of army
stores from that point to Fort Brown was received yesterday. The following is the manner in which
stores are now, and have been, since I have had charge of the QMs. Dept. at this place and the
Brazos, transported from N. Orleans to Fort Brown. The New orleans steamer comes into the
harbor of Brazos, and the stores, both public and private, are transported from the N. Orleans
steamer to the river steamers, which bring the stores to this place either landing those destined for
Fort Brown within the limits of the garrison and within a few yards of the store house or paying
the drayage to Q.Master's store house, when the boat from the small amount of freight does not
put the stores ashore at the store house.
The method of transportation by wagons would be supposing a good wharf at Brazos. The stores
having been put ashore at Brazos by the steamer would have to be stored by the Q. Master. As
you are aware, Brazos is an island, separated from the main land by a strait about 4 [?] miles wide
.at the eastern extremity and decreasing in width to the western extremity of the island where it is
called Boca Chica & is from 100 to 150 yds wide varying with the tide and direction of the
prevaling winds.
I have been told that at times the Boca Chica is so shallow as to admit of wagons passing it. I have
crossed it three times and after careful examination have never found it to be less than 7 feet deep.
I do not think that ten thousand dollars would be an over estimate for bridging the Boca Chica and
exposed as a bridge necessarily would be to the waves from the gulf at every southwestern storm
I doubt whether a durable bridge could be placed there for the above named sum.
About two hundred and fifty yards on this side of the Boca Chica there is a small bayou of laguna
which at present has a bridge over it, but it needs repairs. The ground near this latter bridge is
boggy and the road between the small bridge and the present crossing place of the Boca Chica is
subject to over flow from high tides. The remainder of the road, about 24 or 25 miles to this
place, is very fine in dry weather, passing for the greater part of the way over a low prairie of
recent formation & whose dark soil, when dry, is almost as hard as stone, but when it rains for any
considerable length of time, I should think it almost impassable.
A flat boat might be placed at the Boca Chica, but from the shifting nature of the beach the
landings on both sides would require constant repairs.
As to the comparative cost of transportation from the Brazos to this place, I suppose flour which

is one of the principal stores received, may be taken as a fair example. A wagon will transport ten
barrels of flour; not that the weight is a load but the bulk fills the wagon body. A wagon leaving
here, supposing there was a flat boat at the Boca Chica, would require two days to go to the Depot
at the Brazos (32 miles) load and cross the Boca Chica; the 3rd day it would return to this place.
At $20 per month the pay of the transfer would be for three days $2.00. Corn for 6 mules for 3
days, 216 lbs at 1.50 pr bushel $5.80, making $7.80. Supposing the wagons to be constantly

•

I

I

employed, & without taking into consideration, [illegible] the loss of animals & the wear of wagons
& harness.
The cost of transportation of ten barrels of flour by the steamer costs at $.50 pr BBi $5.00. It is
not at all necessary that stores should be landed at Brazos. No private freight is landed there but
is transferred from the vessel bringing it there, that destined for this place to the Rio Grande
steamers, that for the U.S. bonded warehouses at point Isabel to lighters. There is another way
of receiving stores by lightering to Point Isabel & thence in wagons to this place. The lighterage
from Brazos to Point Isabel, 4 miles, is about the same as the freight to this place, and is only
resorted to by merchants desiring to store their merchandize in the U.S. warehouse & not to pay
the duties until the stores are withdrawn.
When there was a wharf at Brazos, vessels desiring to leave the [illegible] sometimes landed such
stores at Brazos as were not liable to injury from becoming wet, lumber for instance. The
insurance offices will not insure property to be landed at Brazos en route for this place because
Brazos Island is subject to over flow and much property has thus been lost. I believe there is
storeroom here sufficient for all the stores destined for the Rio Grande posts. There are three
store houses here each 100 feet long & 30 feet wide. At present one of these store houses is used
for a Commissary Store. One is used for the stores of Light Company "M" 2nd Artillery. The 3rd
as quarters for "L" Combany 1st Artillery. There is also another store house 110 feet long, 35
wide, two stories high, the 2nd story being occupied as an office and clothing room, the lower story
is used temporarily as a carpenter's shop.
In conclusion, I am convinced that the occupation of Brazos as a Depot is not at all necessary,
believing the present method of transporting stores more economical than by landing them at
Brazos and transporting them thence to this place by wagons. Should the store houses at this place
be insufficient there are buildings at the Brazos that might be removed to this place at less cost
than would be required to keep the Depot in repair.

l

It will, however, be necessary to have a clerk at the Brazos to make out bills of lading for the river
steamers & to superintend the transfer of stores from the N. Orleans to the Rio Grande steamers
and one or two men as laborers & expressmen to take care of the buildings. An additional
advantage in having the stores at this place and dispensing with the Depot at the Brazos would be
in having all the stores and property under the immediate supervision of the officer responsible
for them. A room 15 feet wide and 30 feet long would be sufficient to contain all the stores under
cover at the Depot & $200 would probably bring them here, where they will ultimately be required.

There is a considerable amount of unserviceable property there which was inspected & reported
upon Feb. 26, 1860, but no orders have been received for its disposal. Such of it as is to be sold
would I think bring a price here that would justify its transportation to this place; there being but
few residents at Brazos. A considerable amount of the stores at Brazos have been issued on
special requisition to the troops on this frontier or expended in repairs at this place.

I

I
The above report is longer than I desired it should be but I hope its length will be attributed to
a sincere desire to furnish the Principal Quartermaster such information as will enable him to act
advisedly in the matter under consideration.

General:
I am instructed by Capt. M.D. McAllester, Chf. Engr. Mil. Div. West Miss. to have constructed on
Brazos Island Texas a field work capable of garrisoning about fifteen hundred (1500) men. The
plan of the work as enclosed will develop about (1000) one thousand yards of interior crest and
will require much lumber in the construction, on account of the peculiar character of the soil, or
rather sand, for the island is only a sand bar in reality. The accompanying diagram is a cross
section of the proposed parapet.
It will require about 100,000 feet of lumber for the parapet alone in addition to what can be had
from R.R. ties. The magazines, platforms, etc. will require 100,000 more, making a total of
200,000 feet. The market price of ordinary lumber in this city is at present from $65.00 to $75.00
per thousand. But I am endeavering to make contracts at $45.00 or $50.00. The lumber required
to be bought for the fort will amount to at least $10,000. About 30 carpenters at $2.50 per day will
require $1,875.00 more per month and their services will be required about two months, making
$3,750 for laborers, etc. Total estimated cost of work to Engr. Dept. $13,750.

& 5' high, (in clear), with entrance 3' wide. The wood work of this magazine is constructed of Rail
Road ties 8" in thickness, the side walls & roof are calked & covered with over one foot of clay
well rammed & six feet of sand on top. The end opposite the parapet is protected by seven feet
of sand revetted with sand bags. The parade of Redoubt B is raised 18' above the levee outside,
& the ground under the magazine 4' more in order to secure it from moisture. The covering of
the magazine will answer for a traverse for the guns on the left face, & shoulder angle. One
ventilaor has been completed, another begun. The magazine at the channel battery is 18' long, 9'

Col. S.H. Manning

Galveston, Texas
Colonel,
I have the honor to inform you of the completion of a new & excellent wharf at this place. It is
130 feet long by 75 feet broad, located just west of the old forage wharf, with which it connects,
giving a bonus [?] front of 150 feet.
I am unable to give you at this time its exact cash [value] as I have not the invoice price of the
lumber. The piling is all of cypress lumber (7000 cubic feet) being a surplus of that received for
the Rail Road Bridge at Boca Chica. The flooring is of 3 inch spruce plank (35,000 feet).
The cash of labor will be less than one thousand dollars having done nearly all the work with
details. This wharf is extended far enough into the channel to prevent the sand washing in &
filling it up as it did the old one.
There is 12 feet of water at its front at even tide. The longest vessel that ever crosses the bar can
lay alongside and I will guarantee it to stand two [?] years before the worms affect it.
I propose to charge private vessels wharfage for use of it, and think in a short lime the Govt. will
be reimbursed for expense of its construction.

New Orleans, La.
May 20th, 1867
Quarter Master Gen'!:
Dear Sir:
I have understood that certain parties are endeavoring to effect a sale of the Island of Brasos de
Santiago (near the mouth of the Rio Grande in Texas) to the U.S. Government. I deem it my duty
to inform you directly that the parties referred to have no title to the land from the state of Texas.
The patent for the land was never issued to them and never will. If the Govt. purchase their title,
it will lose the money. There is no reason why the Govt. should want to purchase the whole
island, which conprises 1800 acres. A few acres would answer the Govt. and if the Govt. purchased
all of the island they would virtually shut up the most important harbor on the Texas coast to
commerce. Capitalists in New York are anxious to build a rail road up the Rio Grande, by which
the U.S. Government will get their freights reduced 100 pr. ct., but they will not invest unless the
Government will not attempt to purchase the whole island. This island will be the site of a fine
city if the Govt. will not assume to control it, further than is necessary. Freights now cost the
Govt. 1.00 per hundred from Brasos Santiago to Brownsville. If the Govt. will allow the R.R. to
be built and will not c!a"im a right to the island she will eventually get her freights to Brownsville
for 10 cts. per barrel!.
Resp. Yours
T.J. Smith

Bvt. Major General D.H. Rucker
Acting Quarter Master General, U.S. Army
Washington, D.C.
General:

I

I.:

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th inst. informing me that the
bid qf $5,000 offered for the Brazos Santiago R.Road is too far below the value of the property
to be entertained, and also instructing me, that unless more favorable terms can be obtained, to
cause a\l the moveable property pertaining to this Road, collected, and securely stored (if this has
not already been done) for a more favorable opportunity for its sale.

[l

In accordance with your instructions I have directed the proper officers to have the property
alluded to, securely stored, subject to sale at such times as you may direct.
The bids heretofore offered for this road having been rejected, I recommended that the offer of
$5,000 be accepted, as under the circumstances I conceived it the most advantageous to the
Government.
To store the property of this road as directed, will actually cost the Govt. much more than the
material is worth; and in my opinion it can only be sold eventually as old iron, and will bring about
one half of the sum now offered for it.
This road is washed away in sections, and it is impossible in its present state to run an engine on
it. To gather up its moveable property, it will require a force of wagons, teams, and laborers, at
a considerable expense.

I

I

l

Wishing to be exonerated from any blame in the matter, I make this statement of fact, upon which
I based my opinion in recommending the acceptance of the bid of $5,000 with the belief that in
the present state of the road, and the expenses consequent in removing the property as directed,
will be an expense to the Government, not justifiable by any expectations of a greater sum of
money than the present offer of $5,000.

I have the honor to report for your information, the following views expressed in a communication
to me, by Captain W.A. Wainwright, A.Q.M. U.S. Army, Supervising Qr. Mast. Sub. Dist. of the
Rio Grande, Tex. dated Brownsville, Texas, March 27, 1868, calling attention to the condition of
the U.S. Military Rail Road, from Brazos Santiago, Tex. to Whites Ranch, Texas, and
recommending that "The bid of Messrs. King, Kennedy & Co. ($5,000.00) be accepted, and deems
that this amount is full as much as can be realized for it, in this part of the country, and in the
condition which the whole of this property is now in."

"If this property be stored as the Quarter Mst. General U.S. A. directs at Brazos Santiago, the salt
water will inevitably decrease its value by rust and decay, or if it be shipped to this place or to New
·Orleans, the freight therin would nearly equal the gross proceeds of sale, inasmuch, as the two
engines, surplus rails, chains, etc. are already in a very unserviceable condition. The prospect for
better terms than $5,000.00 (standing offer) is not probable, so long as merchantile business is thus
stagnant as at present."

. _J

1-i

I:

tl
l

"Should the party not comply with the offer made, I would recommend that the property be
advertized, bids received for the same, and struck off to the highest bidder, immediate possession
being given."
In connection with this matter of the rail road in question, I would respectfully inform the Qr. M.
Genl. U.S.A., that upon a temporary inspection made in Texas (per sp. order No. 46, Hd.Qr. 5th
Mil. Dist.; Feb. 29/68) in March last, I am now of the opinion, that from the unserviceable nature
of the property of this road, that $2400.00 for the whole as it now lays, is about its full value. The
property in my opinion (from personal observation) is not worth the expense of storage or
shipment.
Previous recommendations of mine have been given in this case, and the whole matter of this rail
road is respectfully submitted for the consideration and orders of the Quarter Master General, U.S.
Army.

General:
I have the honor to be in receipt of your communication of the 18th inst. relating to matters
concerning the Mil. R.R. at Brazos Santiago, Texas, and the information which you desire in regard
to the rapid deterioration of this property, particufarly the locomotive which was reported in the
Autumn of 1867 to be serviceable, etc. etc. is respectfully submitted in the following report.

On the 7'0ct. ,1867 a hurricane destroyed not only a great portion of this road, but every building
at Brazos Santiago, Texas (your letter acknowledging receipt of this news is marked Bk. 73, M.
1026, Miss Q.M.G.O., Deer. 4, 1867) from the nature of the soil (sand) the road was completely
washed away in sections, and the buildings or sheds in which the locomotive and other property
was then stored were destroyed. Upon my assumption of the duties of Chf. Qr. M. of this Dist.
in the latter part of Decr/67 this road was then under advertisement for sale in the condition it was
at the time. On the 10 febr./68 the subject of this sale was communicated to the Qr. M. Genl. in
my letter of the 19 Feb. (your reply recd. marked book 74, I. 507, Mis) $5,000 was offered, this
sum not being accepted by the Qr. M. Genl. I obeyed your orders, and directed the Chf. Qr. M.
Dist. of Texas, to cause all the moveable property pertaining to this road to be collected and
securely stored (if this had not already been done) and await a more favorable opportunity for its
sale. On the 26 Feby/68, I advised the Qr. M. Genl. of my action, and called his attention to the
staie of the road, the labor and expense, etc. to effectually carry out his orders, and recommended
in lieu of this labor and expense,- that the offer of $5,000 be accepted and explaining in said letter
why this offer was in my opinion the most advantageous to the Government.
This letter was acknowledged Mch 7/68 (reply marked Bk 75.I.120.Q.M.G.O.) and in reply of
Qr.M.Genl. it was suggested that the locomotive and moveable property be shipped to New
Orleans, La. and sold at public auction, the Qr. M.Genl. being of opinion that by this means a
larger sum could be realized than the $5,000 offered. In view of the great expense attending the
movement and shipment of this property, it was not deemed in the opinion of this office
expeditious to do, and as directed by the Qr. M.Genl. I offered to accept the bid of $5,000 and
perfect the sale. But the parties offering this bid withdrew altogether, and declined to purchase.
The road was again put up for sale and but $2,400 was bid, communication forwarded to Qr.
M.Genl. of this sale, and acknowledged in your reply (marked 4.D.Bk. 8.13.75) of Mch 14/68. The
Chf. Qr. M. Dist. of Texas, was again called upon to carry out your instructions, and have this
property put under cover, or otherwise secured and protected (as may be best) from damage, and
await further instructions.
,
The damage done to this property by the hurricane alluded to was unavoidable. No new structures
were erected, but the means at hand were used to the best advantage, the locomotive was
sheltered, all the moveable property that could be boxed up was so secured, and no property was
allowed to be exposed to the elements, that it was possible to secure and protect.

/!

I'

I have taken the proper measures to carry out your instructions in every instance. Those conveyed
in your communication of the 18th inst. will be carried out at once. The iron of the road will be
collected and stored, which labor will cost more than the entire stock is worth.

Sir:
You are assigned to the duty of making an examination & survey of the Harbor & Pass of Brazos
Santiago, Texas for the purpose of collecting all information needed to form plans & estimates for
such work of improvement as you may recommend be undertaken by the general government, to
deepen a channel across the bar at the entrance to the pass and to protect the harbor. You will

If after constructing a jetty of this kind it is found that the bar has only moved further

the new position of the bar. The object of submitting this estimate is to show the cost of what is

such an expenditure.

I learn from good authority that Messrs. King, Kenedy & Co. have closed a contract for a lease
of the Govt. wharf and warehouse at Brazos Santi. and that the transaction has not been in the
usual way ot leasi.ng or selling Govt. property. It is said that it has been rented for $1000. One
thousand dollars per year and I am certain that other parties will give more for it.
Messrs. King, Kenedy & Co. have enjoyed a monopoly of the carrying trade between
Brazos and places on the Rio Grande, and no doubt in a secret manner have got possession of said
wharf and warehouse in order to prevent the new transportation company from using them or to
make it and others pay exhorbitantly for the privilege of making use of them. In running a steam
line between New York and Brazos I am compelled to have a deposit of coal there and for using
it I have built a coal house near the Government warehouse, and have had to wheel the coal across
the Govt. wharf, for which I have been paying at the sale of fifty cents per ton, a pretty high rate,
but this I would not consider unjust if all other goods landed by other parties paid wharfage
accordingly. The lax is said to have been laid on to raise a fund to keep the wharf in repair, which
is perfectly right, for the parties causing the damage should pay for it. I am credibly informed that
my vessels have never done any damage whatever to the wharf and that the only damage has been
done by the steamers of the Morgan Line and King, Kenedy & Co.
The wharfage tax I believe is on coal, cattle & lumber only. Of cattle, very few cross
the wharf, and then only to ship by the Morgan line and on which the shippers pay the wharfage.
On lumber, none is landed on it except for Govt. use. The Morgan line of steamers continually
use the wharf and wharf [sic, warehouse], landing and storing therein thousands of Bbls of freight.
The boats of King, K. & Co. also use the wharf & warehouse in same manner and neither of these
parties pay anything for the use of said premises. I am informed that the reason why they pay
nothing for the use of the wharf, is that the Morgan line brought some timber free of charge and
King Kennedy & Co.'s men helped repair the wharf. It strikes me if Morgans steamers broke the
wharf, it is their duty to furnish material and repair the wharf and also pay wharfage if the same
is to be exacted of others.
If the Govt. wishes to dispense of or lease the wharf & warehouse, the Public should
have an opportunity of bidding for it and if wharfage is to be paid all vessels using should pay a
regular rate per ton.
I am informed that the contract with King Kenedy & Co. has been forwarded to
General Halleck for approval.
Trusting you will favor me with an answer.
I am Respy. Yours
H.E. Woodhouse

I have the honor of addressing you in the capacity of President of the Rio Grande Railroad
Company, with regard to a matter which affects the interests of the United States, and is,
therefore, entitled to your favorable consideration.
I have been informed that certain parties, known as the steamboat company, the Rio
Grande Transportation Company, and also by the name of King Kenedy & Co. have offered to
lease from the Government of the U.S. the warehouse and wharf etc. at Brazos Santiago, at the
rate of one thousand dollars per annum, with the free use of the same to the Government. I beg
respectfully to present a few remarks against the acceptance of such an offer, as being detrimental
to the public interests and calculated to promote a monopoly which has smothered the
advancement of this frontier and which expects to destroy the prospects and delay the construction
of the railroad which I represent.
We are now actively engaged in constructing the railroad from Point Isabel to
Brownsville, the importance of which to the Government, as c<;innecting Fort Brown and the river
garrisons with Brazos Santiago needs no comment. The saving io the government, in its
transportation over this road, would in a few months be more than equivalent to the proposed sum
offered for rent of the wharf, etc. Such a work of internal improvement should, therefore, on that
ground alone, be encouraged and facilitated.
The steamboat company are bending their energies to obstruct or frustrate the
building of this road. They feel the grasp of their monopoly loosening, unless, by some means they
can control certain appliances among which is the obtaining possession of this very wharf, to the
exclusion of their competitor, the Rio Grande Railroad Company.
We will need this wharf, the only one at Brazos, in the construction of our road, in
the landing of supplies, material, etc. and have reckoned on the generosity of the government for
its use. To place it in the hands of those who could and would exclude us from the use of it,
would be showing a partiality which, I know, is foreign to the intention of the government.
While we do not desire to rent the property, for we ask nothing for ourselves which
we would not have accorded to others, nevertheless, should the Department decide to rent it, it
is most respectfully requested to open the leasing to bids and a fair competition that the offer be
accompanied with restrictions in favor of the public; and that the rates of wharfage be regulated,
etc. otherwise great injustice would be done by the government to itself as well as to others.
I confidently appeal to you, General, who are well acquainted with the locality, to
protect the public and private interests in this section, in this respect. The past history of the
steamboat company regarding transportation, the necessity of railroad communication between the
points named, its importance to the government to facilitate and cheapen freights, are facts within
your personal knowledge, and I feel satisfied that I have but to call your attention, and, through
you, that of the Department, to insure lo these suggestions the consideration which I believe they
are entitled to in view of the circumstances.

We beg respectfully to call your attention to the following extract from a letter from our agent at
Brownsville under date 23rd inst. "Can you not call the attention of Major Howell to the
dangerous position of the wreck of the French brig "Reine des Meir" [sic] in Brazos Harbor? She
is lying on the east side of the middle ground almost abreast the old Gov. wharf. The channel to
the new wharf is filling up by the gradual extension of the point of the spit from the wreck to the
shore, making a shoal and sharp turn in the channel dangerous in flood tide or heavy weather. I
have tried to blow her up but there is no one here who can work under water."
"It would not cost the Government much to remove it and its doing so may prevent
a serious accident. Please see what you can do. If necessary I can get the Collector of the Port
to recommend prompt measures to clear the harbor of the obstruction."
We earnestly join in the recommendation of our agent and remain dear sir,
Very Truly Yours etc.

Brownsville, Texas
February 6th, 1877
Brig. Gen. A.A. Humphreys
Chief of Engineers U.S. Army
Washington, D.C.
General:
In compliance with your telegraphic instructions, and your letter of the 18th ult. confirming the
same, which enclosed a letter upon the subject addressed to the Hon. the Secretary of War by the
Hon. Frank Hereford, chairman of the Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives,
I proceeded, at as early a date as my duties here permitted, to make an examination of the wrecks
obstructing the harbor of Brazos Santiago, and I have now the honor to submit the following
report thereon.
In company with Captain James Baker, pilot of the port, who is perfectly familiar with
the locality and its history since the war, I examined as far as was possible, and took numerous
soundings on and around the wreck of the French brig "Reine des Meir," the same misnamed in
the letter of the Chairman of the Committee on Commerce "Reindeer." She was a full rigged brig
of 350 or 400 tons, and was sunk in the fall of 1875 by striking an old anchor. She now lies in
from ten feet of water at the bows to fifteen feet at the stern. and her hull is filled with sand.
Futile efforts to raise her were made last year by parties, who had purchased her where she lies
on speculation, but who have finally abandoned her. She lies between the anchorage inside the
bar and the wharf at Brazos Santiago and about 350 yards distant from the wharf. On a line from
the wreck towards Point Isabel a middle ground of sand has been formed since the wreck has been
where she is, which for 200 or 300 yards is nearly dry at low water. This was formerly all good
water, that is, ten to twelve feet, which is all that can be carried over the bar (at present date not
more than eighi and a half feet can be carried over the bar; but this is variable). Communication
between the anchorage and the wharf has thus been shut off, except by the narrow but deep
channel between the wreck, and the south point of the Brazos. The anchorage has also been so
reduced in size, that vessels have little room to manuever, or to swing at anchor. It is therefore
very desirable that this wreck be removed. It will be necessary to blow her to pieces with
explosives and to remove the fragments piecemeal. There are besides in the harbor several iron
obstructions, old anchors and shafts of steamers, some of which were lost, others being purposely
deposited during the war. These I could not examine as they can only be found by dragging.
Captain Baker pointed out to me their approximate locations, and states that there are five or six
of them. The steamship "Harris" of the Morgan line, struck on one of these last season, causing
considerable damage. They are dangerous obstructions, and can be removed by the labor and
machinery used to remove the "Reine des Miers." The ojher wrecks are those of the steamer
"Nassau," and a vessel and cargo said to be rail-road iron, lost during the war. Of the "Nassau"
little remains but the boiler and cylinders. Of the vessel the cargo and a considerable portion of
the hull. These lie near the south point of Padre Island and in the best water outside the bar
proper. I was unable to visit them, as at the time the sea was breaking heavily on the bar. The
pilots however, and Mr. Gomila [sp?], agent of the Morgan line of steamers, do not consider them
in the way of vessels, or would not be if properly buoyed. The pilots say the best water is near
them however and that a large buoy is very desirable. I do not recommend therefore that any
money be appropriated for their removal.
For the removal of the "Reine des Meir" and the iron obstructions I respectfully
submit an estimate of cost in detail. It is difficult to make a close estimate, as divers and materials,

all have to come from New Orleans. All such labor has to be estimated at a high rate on account
of the expense of bringing and returning it, and the time lost "in transitu." The only
communication with any city where materials can be obtained is by the steamer of the Morgan line,
which makes the trip from Morgan City to Brazos Santiago and return about three times a month.
I have estimated for gunpowder as that is the only explosive of which I can now obtain the cost.
It would doubtless be advisable to use some other agent but the cost would probably be not very
different.
There is a scow flat at Brazos, and a steamboat with hoisting apparatus. These are
the property of the Rio Grande railroad company and can be hired for the work.
The cost of the removal of the wreck of the "Reine des Meir" and the iron
obstructions mentioned I estimate at six thousand dollars.
Very respectfully,
Your obedient servant,
James F. Gregory
Captain of Engineers
