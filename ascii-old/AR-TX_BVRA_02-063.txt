ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted a 100% pedestrian
survey of a 36.32 acre tract of land in the city limits of Buffalo, in Leon County, Texas on
February 12, 1999. The area investigated is the site of a proposed Shelley V. Pate
Memorial Park. No Federal agency was involved in this project that was conducted
under Texas Antiquities Committee permit number 2120. The project area was
investigated by shovel testing and backhoe trenching, and no archaeological sites were
found. It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction as
planned. Copies of the final report are on file at the Division of Archeology, Texas
Historical Commission and Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin,
Texas, the City of Buffalo, and BVRA in Bryan, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Buffalo proposes to construct a city park on a 36.32 acre tract of land
in the city limits of the town (Figure 1). The project area is bounded on the north, west,
and south by private land and by Cane Branch, a tributary of Mustang Creek, on the
east (Figure 2). The project area is depicted on the Buffalo topographic quadrangle,
dated 1965 and photorevised in 1982 (Figure 3). Proposed construction consists of
tennis courts, trails, softball field, playscape, basketball court, pavilion, picnic units,
volleyball court, pond/nature study area, restrooms, parking spaces, and entrance and
park road. The site of the proposed park is on a high sandy hill overlooking a regularly
flowing stream. Leon County contains numerous significant archaeological sites, both
prehistoric and historic, and the area has been the subject of several major cultural
resources investigations. Realizing the potential for sites within the proposed park site,
the Texas Historical Commission, Division of Archeology, requested a professional
archaeologist examine the area. In order to satisfy this requirement, the City of Buffalo
retained BVRA to conduct the cultural resources survey that was performed under
antiquities permit 2120 and BVRA project number 99-02. The Principal Investigator was
William E. Moore.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following general discussion of Leon County is taken from the soil survey
(Neitsch et al. 1989) and the 1984-1985 Texas Almanac (Kingston and Harris 1983).
Leon County is situated in the eastern part of Central Texas and consists of 690,861
acres or 1079 square miles including areas under water. It has an irregular shape and
is about 28 miles long by 40 miles wide. Elevation in the county varies between 630
feet above sea level in the west-central part of the county to about 140 feet in the
southeast area. Overall, the topography is characterized as undulating to gently rolling
and generally sloping to the southeast.
Leon County is located in the West Gulf Coastal Plain, Texas Claypan Area, and
Texas Blackland Prairie Major Land Resource Areas. The soils in the county formed
under timber, post oak savannah, and prairie vegetation. Those formed under timber or
post oak savannah are light-colored fine sandy loam to fine sand while soils that formed
under grass consist of dark colored fine sandy loam to clay. The county is drained by
numerous creeks and streams that flow into the Trinity and Navasota rivers which form
the east and west boundaries of the county, respectively. Annual rainfall varies from 39
to 46 inches. The January minimum temperature is 38 degrees and the July maximum
temperature is 95 degrees. These climatic conditions create a growing season of 270
days.
According to the Soil Survey of Leon County, Texas (Neitsch et al. 1989:Sheet
12), the project area is composed mainly of two soil types (Figure 4); the TenahaCuthbert complex, 8 to 20 percent slopes (TcE) and Hatliff fine sandy loam, frequently
flooded (Ha). Three other soils are also present; Flo loamy fine sand, 1 to 8 percent
slopes (FoC), Nugent loamy fine sand, occasionally flooded (Nu), and Wolfpen loamy
fine sand, 1 to 8 percent slopes (WoC).

The Tenaha-Cuthbert complex soils (TcE) comprise all of the project area except
for the narrow strip of Hatlilff fine sandy loam (Ha) along Cane Branch. The TcE soils
are deep, strongly sloping to moderately steep and well drained. They are found on
broad hills and side slopes above drainageways on uplands. The main limitations of
these soils are steepness of slope, erosion, and drought. The Ha soils are deep, nearly
level, and moderately well drained. This soil type is found on bottomlands, and slopes
or 0 to 1 percent. This soil is subject to flooding more than once every two years.
Permeability is moderately rapid. The available water capacity is low, but the soil is
saturated with water for periods of a few days to a few weeks in winter and early in
spring in most years. Runoff is slow, and a high water table is within two feet of the
surface during the winter.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Leon County is situated
within the Prairie-Savanna archeological study region. Although over 400 sites have
been recorded at TARL prior to this survey, the site density in the county is low in terms
of sites per square mile. Figure 1.1.3 in the planning document indicates that in 1993
Leon County had only 0.001 - 0.1 sites per square mile. This makes Leon County one
of the counties with the lowest site density in the state. In 1985, according to a
statistical overview prepared by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al.
1985:83), Leon County contained 115 recorded sites. It is beyond the scope of this
report to discuss in detail the archaeological background of Leon County, especially
when several recent in-depth studies are available. Therefore, the following discussion
is taken from the planning document for the Eastern Planning Region and several of the
more recent contract reports.
The first major archaeological project to affect Leon County was the Lake
Limestone study (formerly Upper Navasota Reservoir). The lake is located in Leon,
Limestone, and Robertson counties with the majority of the project area in Limestone
County. This work was conducted by the Texas Archeological Survey in 1974 under
contract with the Brazos River Authority (Prewitt 1974; Prewitt and Dibble 1974). Only
areas of high site probability such as floodplains and valley margins along the Navasota
River and its major tributaries were surveyed. Fifty-two prehistoric sites were recorded
within the reservoir area. Of this number, 37 were found to be situated on the crests or
slopes of eroded valley margins. Fifteen historical localities were noted but not
recorded as sites. National Register eligibility testing was conducted in 1975 (Prewitt
1975) and 1976 (Prewitt and Mallouf 1977). Mitigation was conducted at four of the
Lake Limestone sites in late 1977 under the direction of David S. Dibble and Elton R.
Prewitt (Mallouf 1979). One site (41LN21) is in Leon County.
Following the Lake Limestone project, the next major study in Leon County was
conducted at Jewett Mine where work was performed from 1980 to 1991 and is still
ongoing. The majority of sites in the county are on Jewett Mine property, and most of
our current knowledge of the prehistoric and early historic sites of the area has been
obtained from these studies. Archaeological firms who have worked at the mine include
Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (1980), Geo-Marine, Inc., Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., and the Archeological Research Laboratory at Texas A&M University.

One of the more significant studies in the county was a 1981 survey by Espey,
Huston & Associates, Inc. (Freeman and Voellinger 1982) of the first five-year Texas
Railroad Commission Permit area. The prehistoric sites appear to represent a hunting
and gathering economy that spanned the Archaic and Neo-American periods. A central
based wandering exploitation system with base camps along the major creeks and
specialized activity areas along tributary streams is suggested. The historic sites date
to the late 19th and early 20th centuries and are related to the domestic, commercial,
and industrial development, and/or settlement of the area. Fifty-seven prehistoric sites
were found during this survey. Diagnostic artifacts recovered during this survey indicate
a prehistoric occupation that spanned the early, middle, and late Archaic and the NeoAmerican stages. Additionally, they are viewed as an indication of the area's culturally
peripheral location providing evidence of culture contact with areas to the north, east,
and west.
A scarcity of sites in areas of shallow soils was noted by this and previous
surveys. Soil probes on the terraces and upland breaks along the lower expanses of
Mine Creek, for example, repeatedly indicated less than 20 centimeters of soils over a
clay base. In these areas sites were absent. Beginning with the first deep sand hill
upstream, however, an abundance of prehistoric sites was found (Freeman and
Voellinger 1982:2-62). One suggestion for the preference of deep sandy soils is the
possibility that certain plants that prefer these deep soils were desired and exploited by
prehistoric populations. Prewitt and Grombacher (1974:7) found a scarcity of sites
along the major tributaries. They attribute this to the possibility that desirable or needed
resources were more readily available along the mainstream valley than along the
tributaries.
Freeman and Voellinger (1982:2-63) suggest that sites located on higher
terraces and upland margins are smaller in area extent and contain less material
cultural remains than those along the major creeks. The latter should represent
habitation sites with artifact assemblages reflecting the area's major occupations.
Features such as hearths, storage pits, and structural remains might be found in sites
along the major creeks while the smaller sites at higher elevations should contain
activity specific tool assemblages.
The authors (Freeman and Voellinger 1982:2-64) comment on the difficulty of
assessing site depth and size in the project area. Most sites consisted of a single flake
in shovel tests. According to them, "the general lack of surface evidence indicating the
presence of cultural manifestations will require testing far beyond the scope of an
archaeological survey to adequately address real site dimensions." The intensive
shovel testing during this survey sometimes failed to disclose a site's integrity. Many
sites, for example, have no obvious stratigraphy beyond the gradual change from humic
sand to sand to clayey sand. In all, 46 historic sites were recorded. These sites include
the following types: mine, house sites, industrial features, commercial buildings,
outbuildings, and a cemetery.

9

Prewitt and Associates, Inc. also conducted a large-scale survey of 10,000 acres
at Jewett Mine in 1987 (Fields 1988). This investigation is the first cultural resources
work to be done in this portion of the mine. This study consisted of three major areas:
the field survey, an intensive geomorphological evaluation, and integrating the data with
previous surveys to create a management plan utilizing information from 180 prehistoric
sites and 126 historic sites. In all, 51 prehistoric sites were recorded in Leon County as
a result of this project. Of the historic sites, 34 are in Leon County. A major part of this
project was the synthesis of data from the area that resulted in the resource
management plan. The authors present their data in a format that allows the reader to
understand how they arrived at decisions concerning eligibility of prehistoric and historic
sites. Certain terms are defined and recommendations are made for future work in the
area.
The vast amount of work in Leon County, particularly Jewett Mine and Lake
Limestone, has resulted in the recording of over 400 sites in the region when adjacent
counties are included. In Leon County alone, the total number of recorded sites prior to
this study was 420. In addition to the numerous surveys, testing has been conducted at
56 prehistoric sites with data recovery performed at 14 sites. Despite problems with the
archaeological record of the region, such as low site visibility and interpretation based
on survey data, poor preservation of organic remains, a scarcity of sites with clear
stratigraphy, and the prevalence of bioturbation and other disturbance factors, much
has been learned about the prehistory of the area. Fields et al. (1991) integrated data
from the eight excavated sites at Jewett Mine and three excavated sites at Lake
Limestone to compile the most recent synthetic effort for this area. This study resulted
in the isolation of 35 cultural components or analytical units. All but two of these units
represent occupations during the late Archaic, Woodland, or Late Prehistoric periods
(Fields et al. 1992). The interested reader is referred to these documents for more
information regarding the prehistoric and historic development of Leon County and
vicinity. The report by Brazos Valley Research Associates (Moore 1994) contains a list
of all previous investigations in Leon County at the time of that study.

FIELD METHODS
This project was performed using the 100% pedestrian survey method supported
by shovel testing and backhoe trenching. The 36.32 acre tract was examined with high
site probability areas receiving the most attention. Prior to entering the field, the site
records at TARL were checked for the presence of previously recorded archaeological
sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition, a thorough review of the existing
literature for Leon County was conducted. These tasks were completed by the Principal
Investigator who conducted the field survey. All areas that appeared suitable for the
presence of prehistoric sites were shovel tested. Each test was recorded on a shovel
test log and discussed in the project notes. The excavated matrix was screened using
1/4 inch hardware cloth and all recovered artifacts were collected and bagged. In all, 24
shovel tests, 10 shovel probes, and 6 backhoe trenches were excavated. The probes
were not screened and are not plotted on the project area map (Figure 2).

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The site records at TARL yielded no previously recorded sites in the project area.
A review of the literature revealed that several major projects have been conducted in
Leon County, and significant prehistoric and historic sites are present. This
investigation examined 36.32 acres, and no archaeological sites were found.
It was obvious at the outset that virtually all of the project area had been
subjected to various forms of disturbance. First, there are several roads that been laid
out for a subdivision that was never built. As a result, the graded areas have been
exposed to years of erosion creating excellent surface visibility over much of the project
area. It is not known when the roads were laid out, but they are visible on the aerial
photograph in the soils book dated 1989. Second, much of the surface area is
hummocky and contains windthrows, an indication of logging. The presence of small
saplings and briars within the understory is typical of secondary growth that occurs after
an area has been cleared. Although a few large trees were present, they were few
compared to the smaller saplings.
Overall, the project area appears to be devoid of archaeological sites. Should a
site be present, it is likely that, unless it is deeply buried, it is in a disturbed context. It is
believed that the number of shovel tests; probes; and backhoe trenches, combined with
the large areas of exposed soil to clay in most cases, more than adequately sampled
the 36.32 acre tract. No terraces were observed along the creek, and the area was very
moist due to a shallow water table and recent rains. It is believed that the entire project
area should be defined as low probability for archaeological sites.

12

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is
always possible that archaeological sites are missed during any archaeological survey.
Should evidence of a prehistoric or historic site in the project area be discovered during
construction, all work should cease immediately. The Texas Historical Commission
should be notified so that this find can be evaluated before continuing with this project.
