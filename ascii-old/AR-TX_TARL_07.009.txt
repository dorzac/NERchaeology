ABSTRACT
From August 30, to September 5, 1975, an archeological survey
was conducted in areas to be affected by' the Corps of Engineers Three
Rivers Flood Protection Project. The proposed project calls for
an earthfill levee to be constructed, which would partially encircle
the town of Three Rivers, Texas. The levee would~e approximately
4.5 miles long and have a width of approximately 200 feet. During
an intensive surficial inspection oftl;'le areas to be modified,
nine prehistoric sites and one minor,_ locality of hi.storical iriterest
Were located. It has been determined that six of t].1.ese sites
are close enough to the project area to be adversely affected by
the proposed land modifications. A s'uQsurface testing program is,
recommended for five of these sites,"in order to more fully deter­
mine their nature and value as archeological reSources. All five
of these sites contain prehistoric cultural materials and are
located on the terrace of the Frio River. At the present time,
there are no sites in the project area which are listed on, or
proposed for, the National Register of Historic Places. (see

Introduction
From August 30 to September 5, 1975, an archeological sur­
vey was carried out in the areas to be affected by the proposed
Corps of Engineers' Flood Protection Project in and around the
town of Three Rivers I Texas.. The project would consist of a
flood protection levee, which would partially encircle the
town, and the excavation of a cutoff channel in order to realign
the Frio River. The designed levee is approximately 4.5 miles
long and the cutoff channel excavation approximat~ly 0.5 mile
in length. In addition to the proposed levee and'cutoff channel,
two barrow pits are to be excavated.
In order to determine the exact location of the affected
areas, a variety of maps ~ere used. These included a large scale
contour map and aerial photo mosaic wi.Yh the project area
de 1ineated •
Also, a USGS topographic map (Three Rive rs 7.. 5'
Quad) and a Live Oak County highway map were used for further
detail.
Before initiating the survey, all pertinent records of the
locality on file at the Texas Archeological Survey and Texas
Historical Commission were examined. It was determined that no
pre-existing or proposed National Register of Historic Places
sites were to be affected by the proposed construction. Also no
historic marker designated sites would be directly affected by
the project (see Exhibit). The site records of the Texas Archeo­
logical Research Laboratory were examined and it was found that
one prehistoric site (41 LK 43) would be directly in the pathway
of. the northern quadrant of the levee. No other previously
recorded sites were known in the immediate area to be affected by
the project.
On September 25, 1975, after the survey had been conducted,
and the analysis of the materials was under way, the Corps contacted
the Texas Archeo1~a1 Survey and announced a change in the speci­
.fications for the project (Fig. 2). The cutoff channel excavation
was omitted and an additional barrow area delineated. This
~arrow pit area is situated approx~mate1y one mile west of Three
Rivers on the east bank of the Frio River at the point where the
river makes a sharp meander bend to the east around Tips Park.
Also the path of the proposed levee was slightly readjusted. A

discussion of the channel section of the survey is included in
the following discussion, although it is no longer pertinent.
Since the new specifications affected areas that had already been
surveyed additional field survey was not necessary. '

Environment
The project area lies in northern Live Oak county, in and
around the town of Three Rivers, Texas. Three major rivers, the
Atascosa, Frio, and Nueces/ converge in the general area of the
town. The topography is gently rolling to flat a~d the climate
is semi-arid. The elevation ranges from 150 to 200 feet above
m.s.l.
Flora

.*

The area is situated within the West Gulf Coastal Plain
Physiographic Province and is consid'ered to be part of the Interior
Coastal Prairies. (Fenneman 1938: 102-103) Blair includes the
area in the Nuecian district of the Tamaulipan biotic province.
He describes the T2tl:aUlipan as "one of the most interesting bio­
geographical regions in Texas, because it is an area in which
diverse faunas and floras meet and intermingle~ (Blair 1952: 230)
Thorny burshland vegetation dominates the Tamaulipan province
but stands of live-oak (Quercus virginiana) can be found in the
flood plains of the streams. Brush vegetation is characterized
by mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), Acacia, Mimosa, granjeno(Celtis
pallidal, lignum vitae (Porliera augustifolia), cenizo (Leucoph~llum
texanum), white brush (Aloysia texana), prickly pear (opuntia
lindheimeri), tasjillo (Opuntia leptocaulis), Condalia and Castela.
Where the soils are predominantly sandy, mesquite trees surrounded
by various grasses are common. (Blair 1950: 102-103)
During the' course of the survey a small vegetation sample was
taken from along the Frio River. The following items were iden­
tified: Ash, Mulberry, Hackberry, Mesquite, Chinaberry, Oak,
Turk's Cap, Pidgeon berry, Wooly Bucket, Caphor Weed, Dewberry,
Morning Glory and Mustang Grape Vine, Sedge, Bristle Grass, Spanish
MOSS, Frog Fruit, Ruellia, Green Briar, Pannic Grass, Tickle
Tongue, and Sump Weed.
I

Fauna
Some 62 species of mammals are known to occupy the Tamaulipan
province or at least to have occupied the area in recent times.
Blair describes the fauna as consisting of, "36 species of snakes,
19 lizards, two land turtles, three urodeles, and 19 anurans".

(Blair 1950: 104). The aajor mammals of the Tamaulipan include
the Opossum, Shrew, Mole, ArmadillO, Jackrabbit, Cottontail,
Fox squirrel, Ground squirrel, Pocket Gopher, various species of
mice and rats, Gray Wolf, Coyote, Black Bear, Ringtail, Raccoon,
Coati, Weasel, Badger, Skunk, Cougar, Bobcat, Javelina, and
Whitetail Deer. (Blair 1952: 236-247)
Geology
Geologically the project area lies in the South Texas outcrop
of the Catahoula Formation (Tertiary). Sellards describes the
Catahoula as, "a belt
.of rolling, moderately dis.sected, more or
less improved and cultivated farm land in south-central Texas
and pastureland in south Texas which extends from southern
Gonzales County, through northern Karnes, northerrr Live Oak,
and northwestern Duval counties to eastern Webb Coupty and dis­
appears beneath Y9unger f~rmations in Zapata county." (Sellards,
Adkins, and Plummer 1958: 713-714)
...
The catahoula Formation is composed of 60% pyroclastic
materials, 20-3~fo sandstone, and lO-2~fo argillaceous clays with
some conglomerate. It unconformably overlies the Fayette and
Frio Formations and is in turn overlain by the Oakville and Lagarto
Formations. The tuffaceous beds of the catahoula lie upon the
non-tuffaceous greenish clays of the Frio. In northern Live Oak
County the basal Catahoula tuffs have a silica content and stand
out above the underlying Frio clay as a cuesta known as the chalk
bluffs.
Tuff, clay, tuffaceous sand, tuffaceous clay, and conglomerate
beds make up the South Texas catahoula. The conglomerate consists
of reddish brown and brownish gray cobbles of trachyandesite,
andesite, trachyte, pumice, and chert in a matrix of translucent
opal and chalcedony. Sandstone beds in the Catahoula consist of
graysih, medium and coarse grained, cross bedded quartz sandstone •.
It has a high content of opaline cement and occasionally the sand
grains are cemented into a hard quartzite. (Sellards, Adkins, and
Plummer 1958: 714-727)
The chert, chalcedony, opal, and quartzite cobbles of the
Cathoula Formation were an excellent and convenient lithic resource
for the aboriginal inhabitants of the area. These cobbles are
available in the gravel deposits along the stream channels and
in the terrace deposits of the Frio.River.
The soil in the area consists of deep, nearly level, moderate
to slowly permeable, well to poorly drained bottomland soils. The
surface layers and subsoils are loamy to clayey. (Soil Conservation
Service General Soil Map)

Ethnohistory and Historical Background
The Coahuiltecans are generally considered to have dominated
the south Texas area in the late prehistoric and early historic
period. These were a hunting and gathering people, and the basic
unit of organization was probably the family group or band. The
population of the area was undoubtedly quite small and the
Coahuiltecans probably subsisted by exploiting seasonal plant
foods and hunting, while moving in a seasonal round within their
territorial boundaries. For a complete discussion of Coahuiltecan
lifeways see RuedGng 1953,1954; Troike 1962; Newcomb 1961; Hester
1971; and Krieger 1956.
The project area, according to Newcomb, woulq'fall in the
area dominated by a number of bands called the Pachal. Newcomb
states that, "upstream, somewhere about the junction of the Frio
and Nueces, and occupying a large ex~ent of territory, perhaps
crossing the Rio Grande, were a number of bands termed the Pachal,
named after the b~nd tha~ roamed near the junction of the Frio
and the Nueces." (Newcomb 1961: 31)j
The Coahuiltecans are generally'considered to have been a
crudely equipped and static culture which remained consistent,
homogeneous, and unchanged over a very long period of time.
Until recently it was generally accepted that the Coahuiltecans
were without pottery until contact with the Spanish (Suhm, Krieger,
Jelks 1954: 136-143) but Hester has recently proposed that they
very likely received pottery in trade from central Texas
aboriginal groups prior to European contact. (Hester 1971: 200)
The spanish, in the 16th century, were the first Europeans
to contact the Coahuiltecans. Cabeza de Vaca and three companions,
survivors of the Panfilo de Narvaez Expedition, spent eight years
(1528-1536) in the south Texas area. They were treated with
respect as medicine men and traders by the aboriginal inhabitants.
The entire south Texas area was under Spanish domination until
the mid-17th century but without any real Spanish settlement
in the area. In 1675 four Franciscan missions were established
in the Coahuila area. By the late 17th century several missions
were begun for the conversion of the south Texas aborigines. The
missions established for the Indians in the early 18th century
were very successful and attracted large numbers of Coahuiltecans.
By 1800 the Coahuiltecans as a cultural entity" had all but
disappeared. Introduced European diseases such as small pox took
a heavy toll on the mission Indian population, as did hostile
Apache and Comanche who passed through the area. The Coahuiltecans
who survived were quickly absorbed by the Mexican population.
(Newcomb 1961: 31-37)
The first actual attempt at settlement in the Live Oak county
area was in the early part of the"19th century. spanish land grants
were made on the west side of the Nueces, and four of these were

in what is now Live Oak county. A stone house was built on
william Primm's Third league of land, south of Ramirena Creek.
This house was known as Ojo de Aqua de Ramirena and was occupied
until 1813.
Two Spanish roads passed through the Live Oak County area.
These included an oxcart road connecting Brownsville and San
Antonio, which cxossed the Nueces approximately two miles above
Oakville. Another road extended from La Bahia to Laredo and also
crossed the Nueces River.
After 1813 there was no further attempts at settling the county
until 1830. At that time the MCMullen and McGloin colonies home­
steaded in what is now Live Oak and McMullen counties. McGloin
and McMullen were compatriots of James Power who applied for Texas
lands under the Coahuila and Texas Colonization law of March 24,
1825. The impresario contracts of August 17, 1828 called for
200 families to settle east of the Nue~es River. On December 16,
1829,36 families from Ireland arrived" at Port Aransas on the"
schooner Albion. Twenty families immediately ente:r:ed the county
and settled.
Conflicts between the settlers ao.d the Apache and Comanche
passing through the area were minimal. Ther were some reported
sightings of wandering Indians and occasionally the theft of
horses were attributed to them. The bands of Mexican bandits that
filtered through the county were considered to be more troublesome
than the Indians. (Live Oak County Centennial Association Report,
1956: 9 and 37)

Archeological

Backgrou~d

Very little archeological work has been done in the project
area or Live Oak County. Most of the site location and collecting
that has been done has been by local amateur archeo~cal societies
and individual archeology enthusiasts. Some professional work
has been conducted in the counties immediately adjoining Live
Oak County however, and a general chronology of the region has
been established. The following is a brief summary of previous
professional archeological excavations and surveys.
The region of Live Oak County, surrounding counties and
. southern Texas in general is known to havebeen occupied as early
as the Paleo-Indian Stage (Early Man). This time period is
generally considered to date as ear.ly as 10,000 B.C. and is
represented by distinctive projectile points and lithic tool kit
adapted to a subsistence pattern of nomadic big game hunting of
Pleistocene faunas and wild plant gathering. Isolated early
man projectile point types are nqt infrequently found by local
collectors in the region.

In 1940 Sellards reported on Early Man artifacts in association
with extinct fauna in a site near Beeville in Bee County. These
remains were located in the terrace deposits of the Mission. River
drainage. The point types represented were Clovis, ,Midland,
Scottsbluff, Angostura, and later time period archaic stemmed
points. Sellards work was the first indisputable evidence of
man in association with extinct fauna on the coastal plain of Texas
(Sellards 1940: . 1627-1664).
In 1954 Dr. T.N. Campbell recorded sites in Frio and Atascosa
counties along San Miguel creek. Most of the time diagnostic
artifacts observed were those typical of the Archaic Period occupation.
(Hester 1968: 147)
In this area the Archaic is generally con­
sidered to begin around 7,000 B.C. and end approximately A.D.
1000 (Shafer and Baxter 1975: 23).
.,
Hester reported on a number of early man projectile points
from eight sites along San Miguel creek in 1968. .These sites '.
were in Frio, Atascosa, and McMu11en'- Counties, whl.ch are just
west of the project area.' The artifacts collected represent a
late Pa1eo-Indian'occupation and inc1ud~ Angostura, Plainview,
Meserve, and Milnesand projectile po:i,.rits.
(Hester 1968: 147­
161)
In 1967 a preliminary archeological survey was conducted by
the Texas Archeological Salvage Projeqt (T.A.S.P.), University
of Texas, in the proposed Choke Canyon Reservoir area in Live Oak
and McMullen counties. Eighteen sites were recorded on the terra.ce
of the Frio River and artifacts representative of the late Pale~
Indian and Archaic Stages were reported.
(Wakefield 1968: 1-43)
The T.• A.S.P. in 1970 conducted a survey in the Ecleto Creek
Watershed in Wilson, Guadalupe, Karnes, and DeWitt counties.
sixteen sites were recorded and the artifacts observed represent
an Archaic Period occupation.
(Crawford 1971; 1-25)
In 1970 Hester reported on the Berclair site, a late
prehistoric occupation, in southern Goliad County. Artifacts
were collected from the surface of the site after it had been
deep root plowed. These materials include arrowpoints(Perdiz) ,
small end-scrapers, beveled knives, bison bone, and numerous
potsherds~
The evidence suggests that the site may have been
occupied by late prehistoric bison-hunters from the Central Texas
area. (Hester and Parker 1970: 1-23)
The proposed Choke Canyon Reservoir area was again surveyed
by the Texas Historical Commission in 1974. In this survey 129
prehistoric and historic sites were recorded on the terrace of the
Frio and in the upland regions. Arfifacts observed on the survey
included not only Archaic dart points but also late prehistoric
arrowpoints and plain pottery sherds.
(Sorrow, O'Malley, and Fox
1974: 1-23)

In 1974 the Texas A and M University Anthropology Laboratory
conducted a survey in the areas to be affected by a Lignite.
project in Atascosa and McMullen Counties. Eighty-five prehistoric
sites were reported with the bulk of the artifactual materials
being Archaic. (Shafer and Baxter 1975: 1-88)

Research Methods
The period of Ausgust 30 to September 5, 1975, was spent in
the project area carrying out an intensive surficial inspection
of all the areas planned for modification. All si~es located
were recorded on standard University" of Texas site survey forms,
photographed plotted on the topographic map. Limi'ted surface
collections were made. The northern anp western quadrants of
the levee alignment were considered ·t.O·~be the most likely areas
for prehistoric cultural material remains because of their locations
on the terrace of the Frio Ri~er. The majority of lands traversed
by this stretch of the levee are pres~nt1y cultivated for corn
and maize: the natural vegetative cover has thus been removed.
This allowed an adequate inspection of the ground surface in these
areas.

Survey Results
Northern Quadrant
The entire northern quadrant of the levee was examined for
evidence of prehistoric or historical remains. This is the stretch
of the levee thatnms for approximately 0.75 miles in a generally
east-west direction approximately 1.5 miles northwest of Three
Rivers. The ground surface in this area consists ·~f cleared
pasture land with a thin, short grass cover and shallowly plowed
fields. One prehistoric site was located in this area. This
site(4lLK 43) had been previously r~corded by Kurt House of '
Southern Methodist University in September 1974 (fi~es of Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory).
41 LK 43 is located on the sandy loam terrace of the Frio
River approximately 0.5 mile east of the confluence of the Frio
River and Hackberry Creek. It is bordered on the east by the
Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks and ±s about 0.5 mile west of
Highway 281 (see Figure 1 for precise site locations). The site
is approximately 125 meters in diameter and lies partially in a
cleared pasture and partially in a plowed field. The materials
observed on the surface of the site consist of a concentration
of lithic manufacturing debitage, lithic tools, scattered burned
rock fragments, and fragmented mussel and snail shell. This
site also yielded a sandstone grinding slab'fragment. A limited
subsurface probe indicated that it contains a deep deposit of
cultural materials, but the exact depth of the site was not
determined.
western Quadrant
During the survey of the western quadrant of the levee a
·total of four prehistoric sites (41 LK 44, 46, 80, and 81) and
one localityof .historical interest was recorded. This is the
section of the levee situated west of Three Rivers and runs in.a
north-south direction for approximatley 2 miles. Ground cover
is minimal; the proposed levee passes mainly through plowed
fields.
41 LK 44 is located in the area of the proposed barrow pit
just west of fre'levee. The prehistoric materials observed consist
of lithic debitage, burned flint cores, burned rock fragments, and
mussel and snail shell. These materials are eroding out of the
cut bank of the Frio River and a thi.1"l. scattering of the same

,"

material can be found just to the east of the cut bank. The site
is estimated to be approximately 40 meters in diameter and has
been subjected to partial erosion. The site has some depth, but
an exact estimation of depth was not ascertainable from the limited
subsurface probe. The site is approximately 75 meters south of
the confluence of Hackberry Creek and the Frio River and will be
affected by the excavation of the barrow pit (see Figure 1).
41 LK 46 is also a prehistoric site and its is located in
the pathway of the proposed levee approximately halfway between
the confluence of Hackberry Creek and the Frio River, and the
easterly meander bend of the Frio around Tips Par~~ The materials
observed were a thin scatter of lithic debitage, some very large
flint cores, utilized flint flak~s, burned rock fragments, mussel
and snail shell. This site is appro~imately 50 meters in diameter
and lies in a plowed corn and maize field.
.'
41 LK 80, another prehistoric sit~7 is located approximately.
50 meters to the south of 41 LK 46. '~ere is an absence of visible
cultural materials between the two localities which requires that
the. sites be recorded as separate entities. 41 LK 80 is right on
the edge of the sandy loam terrace of .the Frio River and is approx­
imately 100 meters by 40 meters in extent. The prehistoric
materials on the surface of the site consist of a dense concentration
of lithic debitage, utilized flakes, bifacially worked lithic
toolst one projectile point fragment, burned rock fragments, mussel
and snail shell. The pathway of the proposed levee passes over
the eastern edge of this site and it would thus be adversely
affected by its construction.
41 LK 81 is located on a sandy knoll just to the east of
41 LK 80. It is another large prehistoric site. This site (41
LK 81) is approximately 100 meters in diameter and prehistoric
materials can be observed over the entire surface of the knoll and
in the area just to the south. On the surface the site consists
of a concentration of lithic debitage, utilized flakes, bifacially
worked lithic toolst burned rock fragments, mussel and snail shell.
The proposed levee would pass just to the west of this site and
it could be affected by the construction. Subsurface probes
indicated that 41 LK 46, 41 LK 80, and 41 LK 81 all have a zone
of cultural materials, although the exact depth of the sites is
presently unknown.
Just to the west of 41 LK 46, near the rivers edge, there are
the remains fo a late 19th or early 20th century suspension bridge •

.

"",

,

,

10

-

.;.

The only extant features of the structure are several cement
blocks with large inset steel cables and two large supportive
timbers which have almost totally deteriorated. The remains
indicate that the bridge was approximately ten feet in width.
Historical research could probably produce an early _photograph
of the bridge. The site of the bridge could very likely be an
old wagon crossing locality and historical research of the region
could confirm or disprove this hypothesis. The proposed levee
would pass just to the east of this locality and it would not
be directly affected by the construction.
The survey of the area just south of 41 LK 80 was hampered
by a very thick vegetative cover.
This area has not been cleared
or plowed and it is almost impenetrable. An attempt was made
to survey this area by scraping off the ground cover in various
places and investigating the back dirt of burrowing animals but
no prehistoric or historic materials were located •.
The remainder of the western quadrant of the levee lies
inside of th: I:"!Eanler bend of the Frio Riyer. This is a low area
topographically and much of it has been plowed. No prehistoric
or historical materials were encountered in this area.
#

Southern Quadrant
The entire southern quadrant of the proposed levee was inten­
sively surveyed with negative results. This is the po~tion of
the levee that is .immediately south of the city limits of Three
Rivers and runs in an east-west direction for approximately 1 mile.
No aboriginal or historic materials were observed and the ground
cover for the most part was very sparse, facilitating a complete
surface inspection.
Eastern Quadrant
Some visability problems caused by heavy vegetative cover
were encountered during the survey of the eastern quadrant of the
levee; one prehistoric site was located. This portion of the levee
is east of Three Rivers and runs inaa northeast-southeast direction
for approximately one mile. The southern end of the .aastern
quadrant and its associated barrow pit area lie in a field with
a very tall and thick grass cover. The area around the field was
intensively surveyed with negative results. It was impossible to

11

- ..
,

,

.

adequately observe the ground surface in the field itself. Since
the topography of this area is relativ~/low, and no artifacts
were observed on the periphery of the field, the probability
that cultural materials are present in the field is ~onsidered
to be low.
41 LK 82 is a very thin scatter of prehistoric materials just
north of this field.
The material observed on the surface consists
of a very thin scattering of lithic debitage, burned rock, mussel
and snail shell. This site appears to be mainly a surface mani­
festation, possibly of redeposited materials. The site is approxi­
mately 40 meters in diameter.
'J.

At the northern end of the eastern quadrant of tie levee a
high ridge was encountered. This ridge is just north of Olds
Slough and is covered by a very high ,and thick grass cover. Un-'
fortunately it was impossible to see·the ground in this area, but
the probability that it contains cultural material is felt to be
high. This assumption is made because. of the high frequency of
cultural material located on similar~nolls and ridges in the
area. No other cultural resources were identified in the eastern
quadrant of the proposed levee. alignment.
cutoff Channel Area
The intensive survey of the area to be affected by the re­
channelization of the Frio River produced negative results. However,
one prehistoric site was discovered in the immediate vicinity.
41 LK 79 is a large prehistoric site on the sandy knoll
approximately 100 meters southwest of the southern extremity of
the proposed cutoff channel. The surface materials observed on
this site consist of a dense concentration of lithic debitage,
utilized flakes, bifacially worked flint tools, burned rock frag­
ments, mussel and snail shell. Approximately one-half of the site
has been plowed and terraced and one-half is uncleared. The un­
cleared portion does suffer from a certain amount of sheet erosion,
but a large part of the site is undistur~ed. The site is approxi­
mately 100 meters in diameter and subsurface probes indicate that
it has a zone of cultural material. Because of the new specifications,
deleting the excavation of the Frio"River cutoff channel, it is
felt that 41 LK 79 will not be affected directly or indirectly by
the project.

Artifact Descriptions
During the survey a limited surface collection was taken from
the nine prehistoric sites that were recorded. These materials
include 145 specimens of chipped stone, one grinding slab frag­
ment, one plainware pottery sherd, fire cracked rock, and a small
sample of freshwater mussel and snail shell. A brief functional
and descriptive analysis is presented.
Bifaces
,

Bifaces are lithic artifacts which have been~laked on both
faces. The seven specimens, excluding the dart point fragments,
are divided into categories of thick,bifaces, thin.bifaces, and
gouges.

•

Thick Bifaces: (1 specimen)
This is a large, thick, bifacia·1TY flaked artifact with a
thickness exceeding 2.00 cm. It is rectanguloid in shape and has
convex lateral edges.
'No secondary retouch flaking, wear patterns,
battering, dulling, or use marks of aqy sort were observed.
max. length : 10.0 cm.
max. width:
5.60cm.
max. Thickness: 3.40 cm.
Thin Bifaces: (5 specimens)
A thin biface is a thin lithic artifact with a thickness
not exceeding 2.00 cm. which has been fine.ly flaked on both faces.
Thin bifaces could have been used as finished tools and may in
some cases represent a manufacturing stage in the process of making
a tool, such as a projectile point.
specimen A:
This is a sub-rectangular shaped thin biface. All the corners
are rounded and the distal end is wider than the basal end. It
exhibits a minor amount of secondary retouch and the edges are
dulled and smoothed from use. The lateral edges are are convex
and the cutting edge is straight.
max. length: 6.10 cm.
max. width at distal end: 4.45 cm.
max. width at basal end: 3.45·cm.
max. thickness: 1.30 cm.
Specimen B:
This is a generally rectangu'lar thin biface. Almost 75% of
the face is covered with surface cortex. The lateral edges are
slightly convex. The cutting edge is somewhat sinuous. One end
o~ the specimen is snapped off and ~his Aould represent a manu­
facturing failure. No evidence of dulling': .$econdary retouch, or

use as a tool was noted.
max. length: 5.60 cm.
max. width: 4.00 cm.
max. thickness: 2.00 cm.

specimen c:
This is a triangular shaped thin biface. Some secondary
retouch is noticeable of one lateral edge. This edge exhibits
dulling and smoothing from use as a tool.
max. length 4.80 cm.
max. width: 4.50 cm.
max. thickness: 1.65 cm.
Specimen D:
This is a sub-triangular shaped thin biface with a convex
base. The lateral edges are convex an~ the distal end is
roughtly pointed. The abasal corner~ are rounded and the generaY
shape of the specimen suggests thatit represents the pre-form
stage of projectile point manufacture. The cutting edges are
stral.ght and there is a small amount 'C?;f;. secondary retouch on
the lateral edges.

,

Speciment E:
This specimen is broken approximately in half. The re­
maining half suggests a sub-triangular shape with a convex base.
~he basal end has rounded corners and some evidence of secondary
retouch. Its general shape is similar to specimen D.and it suggests
a preform stage of projectile point manufacture. Total length of
the specimen would be probably about 6.30 cm. which is roughly
similar to specimen D. Its other measurements:
max. width: 3.60 cm.
max. thickness: 1.00 cm.
are also similar to specimen D. The maximum length of the frag­
ment is 4.40 cm.
Dalt Point Fragments: (2 specimens)
An identification as to typology was not possible due to the
incomplete nature of the specimens.
Specimen A:
•
This is the basal section of a stemmed Archaic type projectile
point. It has a concave base and parallel sided stern. The distal
end, of the point is snapped off and therfore an accurate total
length measurement is not ascertainable. It has prominent shoulders.
max. width at the shoulders; 3.30 cm.
max. width of stem: 2.50 cm.
max. length of fragment: 3.90 cm.

"

16

Specimen B:
.,
This is a shouldered Archaic style projectile point with
the distal end missing. An impurity is evident in the chert
at the point of the break, and this specimen could represent a
manufacturing reject. The contracting stem forms a dull pointed
basal end, and the sides of the stem are slightly convex. The
lateral blade edges are slightly concave. Total length of the
point would have been probably about 7.00-7.50 cm.
max. length of fragment: 5.55 cm.
max. width at shoulders: 4.70 cm.
Gouge: (1 specimen)
This specimen roughly fits Shafer's definition of a gouge,
namely: "tools which are usually wider at one end and the
wider end is beveled." (Shafer and Baxter1975: ~4) This
specimen is roughly rectangular in shape with slightly convex
lateral edges. It is plano-convex in cross sectio.n and the sides.
are steeply beveled. The specimen is bifacially flaked and the
basal end (narrow end) is snapped off. The corner&of the distal
end are sharp and there is not evide~ce of secondary retouch. No
evidence of use as a tool was noted.
max. length of fragment: 4.25·cm.
max. width at break: 2.90 cm.
max. width at distal end: 3.10 ·cm.
max. thickness at distal end: I.oo cm.
max. thickness at break: 1.75 cm.

Unifaces
(2 specimens)
Unifaces are lithic artifacts which have been flaked on one
face only.
Specimen A:
This specimeh isalm~' square in shape and is a unifacially
flaked scraping tool. The tool is made from a flake which has a
wavy surface, truncated distal end, and a hinge fracture on the
basal end. One lateral edge of the specimen is convex and the
opposite lateral edge is almost straight. The corners are rounded
on the distal end and sharp on the basal end. The specimen exhibits
secondary retouch, dulling and smoothi~from use as a tool on the
basal end and the convex lateral edge.
max. length: 4.90 cm.
max. width: 4.20 cm.
max. thickness: 1.20 cm.

end scraper. It is snapped off at what appears to be approximately
the mid-point of the specimen. It is unifacially flaked and is
plano-convex in cross section. One lateral edge is slightly concave.
The fragment exhibits a small amount of secondary retouch on its
lateral edges. The basal end is roughly pointed but the point
is rounded and dull. The maximum length of the specimen is not
ascertainable.

Leon Plain Ware as described by Suhm. (Suhm and J'elks 1962: 95)

Summary and Recommendations
During the course of the survey n:i.ne prehistoric sites and
one minor historic locality were recorded. Five of these sites
are close enough to the project area to be adversely affected by
the proposed construction.
It is recommended that subsurface testing be
sites 41 LK 43, 41 LK 44, 41 LK 46, 41 LK 80, and
order to more fully document their nature, depth,
extent, and scientific value. All of these sites

indirectly, by the proposed land modifications.

41 LK 81 in

are in or near
directly or

Also it is recommended that during the testing period heavy
machinery be contracted in order to dig a test excavation trench
on the grassy ridge just north of Olds Slough approximately .75
mile northwest of the Three Rivers School. The purpose of this
machine trench would be to determine whether or not a zone of
cultural materials exist on the ridge. It is felt that the prob­
ability of it containing aboriginal materials is very high because
of the high frequency of prehistoric materials located on similar
knolls and ridges in the area. It was impossible to determine
this from the surficial survey because of the extremely high and
dense grass cover on the ridge.
It is further recommended that this same machinery be used
to dig a test excavation trench in the area of the newly proposed
barrow pit west of town. The vegetation and ground cover in this
locality was very thick, and a satisfactory surficial survey of

of the area was not possible. The locality is on a prominent
knoll overlooking the river and it is possible that cultural
materials exist, and were not located due to the impenetrable
vegetation. A machine trench test excavation would reveal whether
a zone of cultural material exists in that locality.,
The sites located during the course of this survey, because
of their location and depositional environment, represent a potentially
significant archeological resource. The periodic flooding and
frequent rapid deposition of silts along the terrace of the Frio
River, provides a potentially good environment for good archeological
preservation. An intact site with undisturbed archeological
materials could be of great value in determining aboriginal
technological and subsistence patterns in this region
