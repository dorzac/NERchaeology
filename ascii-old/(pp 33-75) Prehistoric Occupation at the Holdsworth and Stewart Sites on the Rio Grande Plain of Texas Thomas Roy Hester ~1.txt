PREHISTORIC OCCUPATION AT THE
HOLDSWORTH AND STEWART SITES
ON THE RIO GRANDE PLAIN OF TEXAS
THOMAS ROY HESTER AND T. C. HILL, JR.
WITH APPENDICES BY JOHN HOLDSWORTH AND DELBERT GILBOW

ABSTRACT
Archeological investigations were carried out in early 1971 at two
prehistoric occupational sites in Zavala County on the Rio Grande Plain of
Texas. The test excavations at these sites were designed to help solve
specific problems in the local prehistory. Cultural debris attributable to
Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations were recovered. At Holdsworth,
an abundance of Late Prehistoric materials (including bone-tempered
ceramics) overlay ill-defined Archaic components. At the Stewarl Site,
only Archaic materials were found. Analysis of the faunal remains from
Late Prehistoric deposits at Holdsworth indicates an emphasis on rodents
in the subsistence system.

INTRODUCTION
In the past few years, there has been increased activity by both
professional and amateur archeologists on the Rio Grande Plain of
southern Texas (a summary of recent investigations has been
published by Hester and Hill 1971a). One area which has received
particular emphasis has been the counties of Dimmit and Zavala
(Nunley and Hester 1966; HilI and Hester 1971). In the summer of
1970, Hester initiated a long-range study of prehistoric settlement
and subsistence systems in the area. The first phase of this research,
which included a site-testing program, was carried out at
Chaparrosa Ranch, northwestern Zavala County. A preliminary
report on these investigations has been prepared (Hester 1970), but
a final summary must await completion of several special studies
and the analysis of the large body of data obtained during the work.
In early 1971, Hill carried out the testing and surface sampling of
sites in both the eastern and western parts of Zavala County. Two
major sites, Holdsworth and Stewart, were investigated. Although
Hill’s work contributed to the settlement-subsistence research mentioned above, the major objective of test excavations at these two
sites was an attempt to provide new data apposite to the solving of a

34

specific set of problems. First of all, it was hoped that information
on culture sequence could be acquired, since problem-oriented
research in the Rio Grande Plain region remains hampered by the
lack of a firm chronology. In addition, these hoped-for chronological
data could be used to supplement those obtained in Hester’s work at
Chaparrosa Ranch. A second problem involved the temporal
position of the local bone-tempered ceramics (Hester 1968; Hester
and Parker 1970; Hester and Hill 1971b). The Holdsworth Site had
yielded such pottery from the surface and from erosional faces, and
the site seemed an ideal spot to test our hypothesis that these
ceramics date from late prehistoric times (i.e., that they are not attributable to historic groups which operated in the area). Thirdly,
the work was oriented toward the collection of faunal remains to be
utilized in the study of subsistence activities and the seasonality of
site occupation. Erosion in some areas of the Holdsworth Site had
indicated that a variety of animal bones were preserved. Therefore,
all deposits excavated at that site were passed through 1/16 inch
mesh to permit a high recovery of faunal remains. These screening
procedures also allowed for the recovery of all lithic debris, the
analysis of which will be important to our understanding of the
stone-working technologies in this area (Hester 1971e).

ETHNOGRAPHICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL NOTES
The Zavala County area was occupied at the time of historic contact by small groups of hunters and gatherers known collectively as
Coahuiltecans. Descriptions of their lifeway have been widely
published (e.g., Ruecking 1953; Krieger 1956; Newcomb 1961), and
the distribution of various groups in the area has been recorded by
Ruecking (1955) and Campbell (ms.). More recently, Nunley (1971)
has cast doubt on our knowledge of the Coahuiltecans. He believes
that our reconstructions have been generalized quite haphazardly
from widely scattered, and very meager, ethnographic data. It is his
contention that all of the varied groups in this region cannot be
lumped under the rubric "Coahuiltecan". While we do not wish to
discuss the pros or cons of Nunley’s arguments, we do believe that
there are broad aspects of the aboriginal lifeway which can be abstracted from the extant ethnographic data, and we use some of
these in our concluding section.
The environmental characteristics of the semiarid brushlands
known as the Rio Grande Plain have also been given broad treatment in the literature (Kroeber, 1939; Inglis 1964; Gould 1969; Hill

35

HOLDSWORTH/STEWART SITES

and Hester 1971). The region originally supported a grassland or
savannah type climax vegetation. Historic settlement and exploitation of the area led to ecological alterations which brought
about the current brushland conditions (Gould 1969: 12). The native
fauna are representative of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province (Blair
1950). We will present more precise descriptions of the vegetation
and fauna in our discussions of the microenvironments recognized
in the vicinity of the two sites.

THE HOLDSWORTH SITE
This site (designated as 41 ZV 14) is located on the Holdsworth
Ranch in southeastern Zavala County (Fig. 1). It is situated on the
east bank of the west fork of Tortugas Creek, a major tributary of
the Nueces River. The creek (including both the eastern and western
branches) is characterized by a dendritic drainage pattern.

The Holdsworth Site lies in a low area between the main channel
of the west fork and a former course of that stream (Fig. 2). It is
thickly vegetated (the heavy cover has made an accurate estimate of
site size impossible) and is subject to periodic flooding. Three
microenvironments can be discerned in the vicinity of the site (Fig.
2 ). The first, within which the site is located, can be termed the
channel microenvironment. It includes the channel of the west fork

(and its former channels paralleling the present stream course);
there is heavy vegetation along the borders of the stream. A floodplain or "flats" microenvironment is also present. On the east side
of the site it extends for some 500 yards; scattered thorny brush and
much prickly pear (Opuntia) occur. This part of the floodplain is cut
by a small tributary of the west fork. On the west side of the creek,
the floodplain is narrow, only 30 to 50 yards in width. Several sites
have been recorded in the eastern part of the floodplain microenvironment; most appear to be occupation sites spanning the time
range from Late Paleo-Indian to Late Prehistoric.
The floodplain is flanked by hilly uplands, beginning 200 yards
from the creek on the west and 1/2 mile on the east. The fringes of
the uplands include ancient terrace remnants capped by lag gravels.
Evidence of aboriginal .use of the uplands zone is found in the form
of chipping stations, small temporary camps and isolated hearths,
and a few large occupation sites. One such large campsite is 41 ZV
27 (Holdsworth Highlands Site), about one mile east of 41 ZV 14. It
covers approximately 20 acres on a hillslope. There are numerous
intact hearths and large quantities of lithic debris. Commonly found
are heavy chopping and scraping tools, "Clear Fork" gouges, and
Paleo-Indian and Archaic (primarily Early Archaic) projectile point
types (e.g., Clovis, Angostura, Bulverde, Tortugas, "Early Barbed").
Additional data on the flora and fauna of these three microenvironments (channel, floodplain, and uplands) is found in Appendix I.
The Holdsworth Site (41 ZV 14) was originally recorded in early
1969. Surface collections were made at that time by Hill. One eroded
area in the northwestern section of the site yielded both Archaic and
Late Prehistoric artifacts (Frio and Tortugas dart points, Perdiz and
Scallorn arrow points, light and heavy scraping tools, and Leon Plain
potsherds). A few animal bones had also been exposed, including
those of whitetail deer, bison (?), cottontail rabbit, and alligator (?).
Mussel shells were observed and a cutting or scraping tool made
from a marine shell (Macrocallista nimbosa Solander) was found
(see Hester 1971a:87).
In August 1970, the authors visited the site briefly and made a vertical cut in the face of an erosional gully near the center of the site
(Fig. 2). The cut extended eight inches below the surface and
revealed a dark brown to gray midden deposit containing scattered
burned rocks, lumps of baked clay, snail shells, and an abundance
of wood charcoal. Since this particular spot had previously yielded a
Leon Plain potsherd, we felt that the midden was attributable to a

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

38

Late Prehistoric occupation. A charcoal sample was collected and
submitted to the radiocarbon dating laboratory at the University of
California at Los Angeles.*
The nature of the site suggested to us that extensive buried
deposits were present and were a potential source of answers to the
problems outlined earlier in this paper. Excavations were carried
out by Hill during the period of January through April, 1971.

EXCAVATION PROCEDURES AND STRATIGRAPHY
Four test pits were dug at the Holdsworth Site (Fig. 2). Their
horizontal dimensions were: Test 1, 3 x 4 feet; Test 2 and Test 4, 5 x
5 feet, and Test 3, 4 x 6 feet. In the excavation of Tests 1, 2 and 4,
vertical control was established according to natural stratigraphic
units. Zone 1 (surface to 10 inches below surface) is a dark, humusstained alluvium containing occupational debris attributable to the
Late Prehistoric period. In addition to artifactual material, the zone
contains scattered hearthstones (mostly sandstone, but with chert
and quartzite represented), baked clay nodules (Hester 1971b),
gastropods (Bulimulus sp. including B. dealbatus and B. sehiedeanus,
Polygyra texasiana, and Helisoma trivolis), mussel shell fragments
(Unio sp.), animal bones and wood charcoal. Zone 2 begins at 10 inches and continues to a depth which varies between 20 and 26 inches. The soil is lighter in color and contains clay, which increases
toward the bottom of the zone. There is a marked increase in the
frequency of Bulimulus shells with Polygyra and Helisoma also
represented; other debris includes mussel shell fragments, hearthstones, baked clay nodules, animal bones and small amounts of
charcoal. Zone 3, a sterile basal clay, blocky in texture and orangeyellow in color, extends to an unknown depth.
In recording artifact proveniences (Table 1), it was possible to
divide Zones 1 and 2 into equal upper and lower units in Test 1; in
Test 4, Zone 1 is similarly divided.
Test 3 represents the partial exploration of an intrasite feature.
During work at the site, Hill noted an ill-defined, ash-stained area
20 to 25 yards south of Test 2. A 4 x 6 foot unit was excavated in
which the upper one foot of deposit contained a variety of debris, including Late Prehistoric projectile points, bits of mussel shell,
Bulimulus shells, hearthstones and baked clay nodules. The deposit
*The sample was not analyzed until after completion of this manuscript and was
found to be "not older than 300 years" (ca. A.D. 1650; Rainer Berger, personal communication). The sample is from upper Zone 1 and probably represents protohistoric
occupation at the site.

HOLDSWORTH/STEWART SITES

39

correlates quite well with Zone 1 except for an abundance of ash
and a quantity of woody materials (twigs, limbs, etc., some of which
are up to 6 inches in diameter) occurring near the bottom of the
zone. We find it difficult to explain the presence of these wooden
remains. Perhaps they could be attributed to rather recent burning
and collapse of a large tree at the spot as some of the wood is burned, other charred, and some apparently unburned. We discount the
recent nature of the wooden remains since they appear to be sealed
by the Late Prehistoric midden. We have also wondered if the accumulation of wood might be flood-deposited drift; such a
deposition would have had to occur during or prior to the last Late
Prehistoric occupations. A third possibility is that the materials
represent a burned packrat nest, structures found abundantly in the
channel microenvironment today. However, Hill has recently taken
apart a number of modern packrat nests and finds that the components differ from the remains excavated in Test 3. A fourth, and
even more remote, possibility is that the materials are the partiallyburned remnants of a flimsy aboriginal jacal-type structure, such as
documented for the Coahuiltecans by Ruecking (1953: 484). We are
not satisfied by any of these four explanations; fortunately, some of
this ash-stained area remains intact and can be investigated further.
At a depth of one foot in Test 3, a hard clay surface was reached
which revealed charcoal stains when scraped. Lying on (or just
beneath) the surface were two Ensor projectile points, a few scattered hearthstones, and fragmentary faunal remains. Although the
full horizontal extent of this feature is unknown, we believe that it
may be a living surface (a hut floor or hearth area?) dating from Ensor times. It does not appear to be related to the wood accumulation
previously discussed.
The soils at the site (the characteristics of which were described
earlier) appear to be representative of the Maverick-MontellCatarina series (Pederson and McEntire 1966). The Montell and
Catarina components are clays and are of particular significance
because they are vertisols (Jack Stevens -- Soil Conservation Service soil scientist at Uvalde -- and Wayne Hamilton -- former SCS
agent -- personal communication; for a distribution map of vertisols
on the Rio Grande Plains, see Duffield 1970). Vertisols are dynamic
in nature and can cause the displacement of arche’ological materials
within the soils (Duffield 1970).

MATERIAL CULTURE

The artifacts from the Holdsworth Site are described here;
provenience data are given in Tables 1 and 2. Projectile point
typology follows that of Suhm, Krieger and Jelks (1954) and Suhm
and Jelks (1962). All measurements given are in millimeters and
weights in grams. The following abbreviations are employed: L,
length; W, maximum width; T, maximum thickness; SL, stem
length; SW, stem width; and WT, weight. Measurements of fragmentary specimens are enclosed in parentheses.
The format in which the descriptions are presented varies
somewhat from that used in most archeological studies in the Texas
area. We have grouped the artifact categories under three broad
"functional headings (modified from Winters 1969) as we believe
that these enable us to present a better view of the aboriginal tool
kit. (1) Hunting Tools/Weapons: equipment used in the
procurement of game, to which we can attribute the projectile
points; (2) Processing and Fabricating Tools: general utility implements used to process raw materials and to fabricate other types
of equipment; (3) Domestic Equipment: household equipment such
as ceramic vessels used for the preparing, storing and serving of
foodstuffs. Of course some of the items classed as Processing and
Fabricating Tools could be included here, but we see no way to
eliminate this overlap without changing our classification to one
based on the sexual division of labor (i.e., associating specific tool
forms with either males or females).
The residue from the manufacture of chipped stone items in the
tool kit is described under the heading of Tool Manufacturing
Debris.
HUNTING TOOLS /WEAPONS
Projectile Points
Here we have used more or less standard criteria in separating arrow and dart

points. Such distinctions are usually based on the size, technology, and weight of the
points. Arrow points are small and thin and made on light flakes, while dart points
are larger, thicker and made either on biface preforms or on large flakes. Fenenga
(1953:322) has suggested that points exceeding 3.5 grams in weight were used with the
dart and atlatl and those of less than 3.5 grams were used with the bow and arrow.
The projectile point groups at Holdsworth clearly show such a bimodal distribution.
However, a number of so-called "dart points" have been found in direct association
with arrow points at several sites on the Rio Grande Plain (Hill and Hester 1971;
Hester 1970). As the provenience chart in Table 1 shows, two of the ~dart points"
(both quite small) at Holdsworth occurred in Late Prehistoric contexts, though ad-

HOLDSWORTH/STEWART SITES

41

mittedly this may be due to mixing as a result of the dynamic soils present at the site.
Still, we feel that the data allow us to propose two hypotheses regarding the presence
of "dart points" in the Late Prehistoric of the Rio Grande Plain: (1) the atlatl survived
quite late in the area and was used along with the bow and arrow. The bow and
arrow must have totally replaced it prior to historic contact, as early Spanish accounts
make no mention of the atlatl’s use in the region (Ruecking 1955). The retention of the
atlatl might have been due to factors other than cultural conservatism; for example, in
the Valley of Mexico, aborigines of the Colonial period used the bow and arrow to
hunt deer, while the dart and atlatl were retained to hunt waterfowl and to spear fish
(Michels 1971:226). (2) it is also equally feasible that with the advent of the bow and
arrow in the region, small dart points were used along with the new arrow point
forms to tip arrow shafts. Greer (1968:190) has suggested that the Ensor type of TransPecos Texas may have functioned as an arrow point. The possibility of a functional
overlap between "dart" and "arrow" points in southeastern Texas has been suggested
by Aten (1967:17).
Arrow Points (Fig. 3,a-f)
Six arrow points were found in test excavations. Four are examples of the Perdiz
type

and are made from gray, tan, cream, and translucent cream cherts. Two ad-

ditional arrow points are corner-notched and can be typed as Scallorn; they are
fashioned from

dull brown and cream cherts. The lateral edges of one Scallorn

specimen are serrated.

Dart Points (Fig. 3,g-l)
One of the six dart points found at the Holdsworth Site is similar to the Pedernales
type, a large, stemmed form common in central Texas (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954).
It is of brown chert, crudely chipped, and has been burned. Another dart point has a
rectangular stem and is made of translucent brown chert. There is also an unstemmed
lanceolate dart point fragment (the tip is missing) made of translucent gray chert.
Three of the dart points have broad side notches and can be included in the Ensor
type. Two of the specimens were found on the hard clay surface uncovered during the
excavation of Test 3 and both of these points are fashioned from gray chert; the third
specimen is made of cream chert.

PROCESSING AND FABRICATING TOOLS
Bifaced Cobbles (Fig. 4,a-b)
Two cobbles with brown cortex (derived from terrace exposures in the site vicinity)
have been bifaced at one end. One (Fig. 4,b) is a large rectangular specimen, 90 ram.
long, 47 mm. wide, and 46 ram. thick weighing 282.0 grams. The other specimen (Fig.
4,a) is an oblong cobble 79 mm. long, 56 ram. wide and 48 ram. thick weighing 193.5
grams. The bifacial flake removals have created a rough cutting or chopping edge. On
the oblong specimen, this edge has a broad cylindrical band of very heavy dulling.
Witthoft (1955:20) has suggested that such use-wear could result from abrasion caused
by rubbing it against another stone. Perhaps this tool was used to process plant fibers,
skins, or some other thin material which was resting on a hard backing, such as a flat
stone anvil.

End Scrapers (Fig. 4,c-e)
One specimen (Fig. 4,c) is made on a blade of translucent cream chert. The blade
has a simple prepared (or single facet) striking platform and a salient bulb of percussion (a bulbar scar. is present). A convex scraping edge has been formed at the
distal end of the blade; \edge angle is 60°. There is no observable evidence of wear on
the working edge.
A second end scraper (Fig. 4,d) is made on a cortex flake of gray chert. ’?he
scraping edge is crudely chipped along the distal end of the flake, and there is
irregular trimming along one lateral edge. The scraping edge forms an angle varying
from 55°-60°; use-wear in the form of nibbling and crushing is present.
The third specimen (Fig. 4,e) can be best termed an "end-side" scraper, as one of
the lateral edges (as well as the distal end) shows careful trimming. Edge angles on
the distal edge range from 40°-80°, while on the trimmed lateral edge, the angle is 50°.
The specimen is fragmentary and made of light gray chert.

Although distinctive use-wear is absent from all three specimens, the edge angle
data indicate that they could have been used for a variety of tasks, including hideworking, plant processing, or heavy cutting. (Witmsen 1968:156-157).

Notches (Fig. 4,f,g)
One specimen is a flake fragment with a notch 11 mm. in length chipped into one
edge. The edge of the notch shows crushing resulting from use. The second specimen
is a fragment of a blade with a notch (12 mm. long) crudely chipped into one edge.
Dimensions are: L,(43),(30); W, 26,24; T, 13,4,5. Both could have served as implements
for shaving or smoothing the surface of cylindrical wooden shafts.

Graver (Fig. 4,h)
This is a small flake fragment with a carefully chipped graver beak. No evidence of
use was observed under microscopic examination, Length of the graver beak is 2 mm,
Other dimensions are: L, (16), W, 25; T, 2.

Fragmentary Tools (Fig. 4,1)
Tools broken during use include both bifacial and unifacial forms. Bifaces include:
(a) 3 medial fragments; (b) fragment of a beveled-edge biface (possibly a knife); (c)
two burned fragments. Fragmentary unifacial specimens are: (a) a possible scraper
fragment; (b) medial fragment of a double edge side-scraper; (c) a uniface (scraper?)
edge apparently detached by an "overshot" flake (c[. Shiner 1969:227); (d) a large
scraper fragment on which the break has been used as a striking platform for the
removal of several small flakes.

DOMESTIC EQUIPMENT
Potsherd (not illustrated)
The specimen is a body sherd of a bone-tempered vessel. The material is a fine,
compact paste with many tiny bone fragments (some are up to 1 ram. in size). The exterior surface is smudged. The light pink interior retains smoothing striations. Wall
thickness is 6 mm.
This sherd is characteristic of bone-tempered plainware (Leon Plain) found at
numerous surface sitds in southern Texas (Hester 1968; Hester and Parker 1970;
Hester and Hill 1971b). However, this is the first specimen to be found in an excavated context.

TOOL MANUFACTURING DEBRIS
The excavations at Holdsworth yielded a quantity of lithic materials and debris attributable to various stages in the tool manufacturing process. These include preforms
(tools under manufacture), cores, and various kinds of flakes.
Preforms (Fig. 4,m)
Five are crudely bifaced flakes which probably represent an initial stage in the
bifacing of tools. Another specimen is a subtriangular dart point or knife preform
(L,54; W,34; T,17; WT 25.8), and the sixth specimen is a preform medial section.
Cores (Fig. 4,n)
Two cores are intact. One is a semi-conical polyhedral flake core with one part of
its striking platform cortex-covered and the remainder faceted. The platform forms
angles of 750-80° with the sides. Height of the core is 38 mm., maximum platform
width is 60 mm., minimum width is 38 mm. and weight is 59.3 grams. The other core
is a rounded chert nodule from which flakes have been bifacially detached using one
edge of the nodule as a striking platform. L, 70; W, 69, T, 56; WT, 290.7.
One exhausted core was found and there are four core fragments. Three of the core
fragments have simple prepared platforms (i.e., single flake platforms), and the fourth
a multifaceted platform.
Flakes
All flakes from each test pit were collected and analyzed. The flakes have been
sorted into several categories which reflect the technological processes carried out in
tool manufacture. The definitions for each category are based largely on the work of
H. ]. Shafer, (1969) and subsequent modifications by Hester (1971c), Hill and Hester
(1971) and Skinner (1971). Primary cortex flakes have the dorsal surface covered with
cortex; they represent the initial decortication of a core. Secondary cortex flakes retain
some cortex on the dorsal surface, representing further shaping of a core. Interior
flakes have no cortex on the dorsal surface, indicating their removal from the interior
of a core. Biface thinning flakes ("lipped" flakes) result from the soft hammer
technique of biface reduction (Epstein 1964:164). They have lenticular mdltifaceted
platforms which overhang on the ventral surface. Occasional dulling of platform
edges was observed on the Holdsworth sample; such abrasion may result from platform preparation or perhaps from the resharpening of a dulled biface edge (a knife
edge). Flake fragments (the "chips" of Skinner 1971:159) are pieces which lack the
striking platform and bulb of percussion. Twenty percent of such fragments from the
Holdsworth site are burned.
A study of the platform types of all flakes suggest that cores with various types of
platform preparation were present in the chipped stone industry. Some cores were
developed from nodules with a flat striking surface (natural platform). Flakes
detached from such cores have cortex -covered striking platforms. As indicated by
studies at the Chaparrosa Ranch (Hester 1970), one popular type of core in the area
was formed by the halving of a cobble and use of the resultant broad fracture surface
as a striking platform. Thus, flakes detached from such surfaces will have a singlefacet platform. Sometimes these cores underwent extensive platform modification in
the form of faceting (Hester 1970); flakes removed from these cores often have
multiJbceted platforms, although flakes with single-facet platforms could also be
removed. One specialized type of multifaceted platform is termed a convergent plat-

1971c:106). Crushed or shattered platforms were also observed. Figure 8 lists frequencies of flake striking platform types at the Holdsworth Site.
Bulbs of percussion observed on primary and secondary cortex flakes, and on most
interior flakes, indicate their removal by hard hammer percussors. Diffuse bulbs
noted on biface thinning flakes suggest the use of softer-than-stone billets, perhaps of
wood or bone.
Raw materials were obtained in cobble form from terrace exposures near the site.
A variety of multicolored fine and coarse-grained cherts are represented in the flake
debris. Several flakes have the vitreous luster attributable to thermal alteration (Crabtree and Butler 1964; Purdy and Brooks 1971).

h~s a triangular cross section 8 mm. in thickness. The platform is triangular and
single-faceted with a patch of cortex at the distal end. Five "potlids" were noted; these
are circular piano-convex pieces which are the product of the intense thermal fracture
of a chipped stone specimen.
Three specimens are classed as chunks; two are burned. Deacon (1969:155) defines
chunks as "... larger artifact waste predominantly of non-flake origin and graded on
a size basis as greater than 10 mm. in maximum dimension."

THE STEWART SITE
The Stewart Site (41 ZV 121) is located in western Zavala County
(Fig. 6) on the west side of the main channel of Chacon Creek. Occupational debris is buried in a natural levee (alluvial knoll)
paralleling the creek; on the surface, debris is scattered for 30 yards
north to south, varying from 10 to 15 yards in width. Three major
ecological subdivisions can be recognized; many of their characteristics have been previously listed by Hill and Hester (1971: 52-53)
in their report on the Honeymoon Site (41 ZV 34) located downstream from the Stewart Site. There is a channel microenvironment,
including the intermittent Chacon Creek and a narrow band of
vegetation (primarily live oaks and some brushy plants) paralleling
the creek. The floodplain microenvironment is thickly vegetated
with mesquite, prickly pear, and associated thorn brush. Soils are of
the Uvalde-Montell series (Agricultural Extension Service 1965),
and consist of dark grayish calcareous loams 10 to 20 inches thick,
overlying either pale brown calcareous clay loam (Uvalde) or gray
compact dense clay with CaCO3 concretions (Montell). To the east
of the site, the floodplain extends for approximately one mile until
it reaches a line of gravel ridges and hills. This upland formation is
composed of eroded remnants of ancient terrace systems; soils are
gravelly loams overlying deposits of caliche. Waterworn chert or
igneous gravels are exposed on the surface (Pederson and McEntire
1966); the surface often takes on a "desert pavement" appearance.
Climax vegetation includes a variety of native grasses, guajillo,
ceniza, black-brush, prickly pear, and mesquite. To the west of the
Stewart Site, the floodplain is about one-half mile in width and is
cut by a dendritic system of overflow channels of Chacon Creek.
These channels have deep spots ("holes") which can retain water
even during periods of sustained droughts (as observed by Hill
during a severe year-long drought in 1970-1971). A small natural
lake has been formed in one of these channels, ca. 100 to 150 yards
east of the site. The western floodplain is bordered by broad sandy
uplands, covered with native grasses and scattered thorny brush.
Though there has been no detailed study of the modern fauna in
the site vicinity, we suspect that the composition of the faunal
assemblage differs little from that recorded for the Holdsworth Site
environs (see Appendix I).
The initial survey of the site by Hill led to the collection of several
dart points and dart point fragments, indicative of Archaic occupations. These include a specimen with an expanding stem (Fig.
7,f) and a fragment with a bifurcated stem (Fig. 7,i). Two other

stemmed point fragments, two distal fragments, and a lanceolate
binace basal fragment were also collected. Further inspection of the
site indicated that buried deposits were present. Excavations were
carried out by Hill in January and February 1971, to secure information on the presumed Archaic occupation of the site.

EXCAVATION PROCEDURES AND STRATIGRAPHY
Three test pits (all 5-foot squares) were dug at the Stewart Site,
again according to stratigraphic units. Zone 1 extends from the
surface to a depth of approximately one foot. It is a very soft, light
brown soil, containing artifacts, hearthstones, Bulimulus shells, and
bits of mussel shell. Zone 2 begins at a depth of one foot, but its total
vertical extent is not known. It is a very hard, fine-grained, graybrown soil (with an abundance of clayey materials). Only the upper
six inches contain occupational debris. At a depth of 15 inches in
Test 3, a concentration of burned rocks was found. Among the
stones was a side-notched projectile point (Fig. 7,c). The nature of
the concentration is unknown.
The soils appear to correspond to the Uvalde-Montell series
(Agricultural Extension Service 1965).

CONTROLLED SURFACE SAMPLE
A concentration of lithic debris was observed on the site surface
(Fig. 6). A 12 x 12 foot square encompassing the concentration was
laid out. All lithic debris was collected and has been analyzed. Approximately 90 percent of all debris came from the northeast
quadrant of the unit where a cluster of flakes was observed in an
oval area 2 to 3 feet in diameter. In the southwest quadrant of the
unit, a concentration of burned rocks (perhaps remnants of a
hearth) was noted; as these were being removed, a Shumla projectile
point (Fig. 7,a) was found.

MATERIAL CULTURE
Terminology, abbreviations, and measurements used in the
description of the material culture from the Holdsworth Site are also
employed here.

Dart Points (Fig. 7,a-c)

One specimen is a basal fragment with large side notches and a concave base. It is
made of tan chert and was found among hearthstones in Test 3. The other two dart
points were recovered from the controlled collecting area. One of these is made of
gray chert, with corner notches, a concave base, and reworked distal tip. It is quite
reminiscent of "Early Corner Notch,d, Variety 2" excavated by Hester (1971c) at the
La ]ita Site. The second specimen is a very carefully chipped point with basal notches
and heavy barbs made of gray-pink chert. We feel that it can be included in the

Flakes (not illustrated)
The flake debris was sorted in the same manner as that from the Holdsworth Site~
frequencies and provenience data are given in Table 4. All of the flake platform types
described for Holdsworth~ except the convergent type, occur in the Stewart sample
(Fig. 8). Dulling of the striking platform occurred among a small percentage of the excavated biface thinning flakes. However, among those from the controlled collecting
unit, 35% have dulled platforms.
Raw materials recognized in the flake analysis include fine- and coarse-grained
cherts of various colors, and small amounts of petrified wood and basalt. The major
source was no doubt the gravel-capped ridges bordering the eastern floodplain.
The ranges in flake size are given below. Thuse for primary cortex flakes should
probably be discounted because of the very small sample of that flake type, several of
which are fragmentary.

57

DISCUSSION AND INTERPRETATION
We have thus far described the archeological investigations at the
Holdsworth and Stewart sites and the cultural remains obtained as a
result of the work.
One of our stated goals for excavation at the two sites was to
secure information on the local culture history. At the Holdsworth
Site, the stratigraphic data indicate the presence of Archaic occupational remains, although the nature and extent of this occupation cannot be presently defined. Zone 2, in which the Archaic
materials occur, contained a Pedernales dart point, two Ensor points,
a biface, a uniface, a mano, a bifacial preform, and two cores. Further investigation of this zone is required. We would like to point
out at this juncture that even earlier occupational debris may be
present within the site area. For example, recent erosion in the eastcentral part of the site has cut gullies of varying depth. The deepest
of these (ca. two feet) has yielded a fragmentary Plainview golondrina point (Fig. 3,n) and possibly associated materials including
flakes, tool fragments, and a triangular point with dulled lateral
edges (Fig. 3, m). Just downstream from Holdsworth at Site 41 ZV 7,
other Plainview golondrina specimens have been collected (an example is illustrated in Fig. 3,o). All of these presumed early points (cf.
Johnson 1964: 96; Sorrow 1968: 19) are basal fragments. Since they
show no evidence of stream-rolling or other artificial modes of
transport, we can assume that they represent fragments discarded at
a campsite when hunting equipment was being refurbished (Wendorf and Hester 1962:164). Therefore, it is our hypothesis that occupational components of this early period will eventually be
..recognized on the Tortugas Creek floodplain.
The most extensive cultural remains at Holdsworth are found in
Zone 1 and are attributable to the Late Prehistoric period of
southern Texas (Hester and Parker 1970; Hester 1971d ). Represented in the remains are small projectile points (including some examples which others might classify as "dart points"), a variety of tools
made on flakes (end scrapers, notches, gravers, laterally trimmed
pieces), ceramics, and tool manufacturing residue in large quantities. Both Perdiz and Scallorn point styles are present; we could not
separate them stratigraphically, although this may be due to both the
limited nature of the excavations and the small sample of points
recovered. In general terms, these late remains are comparable to
the Late Prehistoric manifestations of the central Texas sequence
(Shafer 1971). Although isolated Late Prehistoric components have
been recognized previously in southern Texas (Hill and Hester

58

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

1971), we did not have the knowledge of associated tool types and
lithic technological data provided by the Holdsworth sample.
Although the Stewart Site occupies a quite similar environmental
position, it is contrasted with the Holdsworth Site by thepresence of
meager remains. There is absolutely no evidence of a Late
Prehistoric occupation at the site. All projectile points recovered
from the site appear to represent the Archaic period. The corner and
side notched examples are not, based on our present data, temporally diagnostic. On the other hand, one specimen is typologically
Shumla, and dated to the Middle Archaic period in the Trans-Pecos
(Johnson 1964). Other materials include a scraper, a notch, a
uniface, several bifaces, and tool manufacturing debris. We are
provided here with an example of an apparently uncontaminated
Archaic occupation site, a rarity thus far in Rio Grande Plain archeology. The variety of triangular dart points considered so typical
of the Archaic of this region are absent. This is not surprising since
stemmed and notched points are known to dominate the Archaic in
the northern portion of the Rio Grande Plain (Nunley and Hester
1966: 251). If the Stewart Site is typical of buried Archaic deposits in
this area, then much excavation will be required in order to define
the sequence within this period.
A second problem investigated in our work was the temporal
position of the local bone-tempered plainware ceramics. It has been
suggested elsewhere (Hester and Hill 1971b) that these ceramics
date to the Late Prehistoric period; this postulate was based largely
on similarities between the local ceramics and those of Late
Prehistoric central Texas. Excavations at Holdsworth revealed a
single sherd in Zone 1, in loose association with a Perdiz arrow
point. While this evidence is far from conclusive, it does add support to the postulate that the bone-tempered ware is a part of the
local Late Prehistoric cultural inventory.
We were also concerned in our investigations with the recovery of
faunal remains to aid in subsistence-settlement studies. A considerable amount of faunal material (relative to the small area excavated) was collected at Holdsworth, primarily through the use of
fine-mesh screens. Had we used the standard 1/4" mesh, the bulk of
the bones would have been lost. Appendix II by D. Gilbow contains
a brief description of the faunal materials. Lack of research funds
has thus far prevented a more rigorous analysis.
All animal bones were found in Zone 1 of the Holdsworth Site. It
is unfortunate that Zone 2 at Holdsworth, and the Archaic deposits
at Stewart, did not yield a faunal sample. At Holdsworth, the lack of

HOLDSWORTH/STEWART SITES

59

Archaic faunal remains may be due largely to our limited exposure
of Zone 2; at Stewart, the absence of faunal remains is attributed to
poor preservation.
The faunal list for the Holdsworth Site reveals the presence of
several species whose habitats today are the channel and floodplain
microenvironments. These include the desert cottontail
(Sylvilagus), cotton rat (Sigmodon) and plains pack rat or wood rat
(Neotoma). Jackrabbit (Lepus) and whitetail deer (Odocoileus) are
species which adapt to a wide range of environmental situations
and could be expected to occur in any of the three defined microenvironments. It might have been possible to kill deer during the time
they watered in the channel zone (Tortugas Creek). The tortoise
(Gopherus sp.) can also be found in a variety of environments. It is
therefore apparent that the local Late Prehistoric inhabitants could
have been exploiting all microenvironments, or just as easily, taking
all animal foods from a single zone. It is clear that all three microenvironments are close and easily accessible, thus lending themselves
to exploitative patterns which could cross cut all environmental
zones (cf. Flannery 1968). While deer may have constituted the bulk
of the meat diet (see Appendix II), there seems also to have been an
emphasis at this site on rodents. Local aboriginal groups were
known to include these small mammals in their subsistence
(Ruecking 1953:485). It remains to be seen if we shall be able to link
such preferences to seasonal hunting patterns as Flannery (1968)
has clone in Mexico.
One other aspect of the subsistence evidence at Holdsworth and
Stewart is the shell remains. Both mussels and land snails are
present at these sites. Mussels, of course, were obtained from the
channel microenvironment; snails could be gathered from any of
the mi~roenvironments. Some of the snails could be introduced to
the sites through natural means (cf. Holdsworth 1969:202 for an interesting example), although we consider most of them to represent
food items (Krieger 1956; Clark 1969). Snail species found in the archeological deposits are identical to those occurring in the area
today.
We have no way of accurately assessing the importance of plant
foods in the local subsistence, although we feel that it was considerable. As evidenced in Appendix I, there are a wide variety of
potential vegetal foods available in the Holdsworth Site area, particularly in the channel microenvironment and on the floodplain.
The ethnographic record for this area indicates the significance of
plant foods in the aboriginal economy (Ruecking 1953: 489). We

60

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

suspect that the exploitation of plant foods was the dominant concern in the prehistoric subsistence system. Plant foods are a reliable
food source and data reported by Lee (1968:33) indicate that they can
be collected with little expenditure of effort. The !Kung Bushmen of
the Kalahari Desert use vegetal foods for 60-80% of their diet, the
collection of which involves two to three days of work per woman
per week (Lee 1968:33). Our best archeological evidence in this area
for the processing of plant foods is the mano and metate. Of course,
other food processing or gathering equipment, such as digging
sticks, may not be preserved. For example, wooden pestles and
mortars are thought to have been used in the region (Beals 1932),
perhaps similar to the set reported by Collins and Hester (1968).
Future interpretations of local subsistence-settlement activities
will have to rely almost wholly on the archeological record~ as there
are scanty data for comparative models in the ethnographic
literature (cf. Nunley 1971). Much more light will be shed on subsistence in Zavala County when funds are secured for the analysis
of a sizable faunal sample (from several sites) only recently
acquired. Unless preserved faunal materials can be found in Archaic deposits, we will have to confine our empirical studies of subsistence to the Late Prehistoric period.
The flint-working technology at the two sites has been previously
discussed in the descriptive portion of this paper. The tool-making
industry appears to be based largely on the use of prepared cores
from which flakes intended for modification were removed. The use
of flakes for tool manufacture is especially evident in Late
Prehistoric times. The source of raw materials was an obvious one:
the gravel-capped ancient terraces which flank the Tortugas and
Chacon stream valleys. There are few primary cortex flakes at
either site, suggesting that the initial decortication of cores occurred
at terrace workshops (Hester 1971e). The occurrence of high percentages of thinning flakes in Zone 2 of Test 2 at Holdsworth and
Zone 1 of Test 1 at Stewart may indicate areas where biface thinning activities were carried out. Such a chipping locus was observed
on the surface at the Stewart Site. The presence of uniface resharpening flakes at Holdsworth indicates a tool rejuvenation technique
(cf. Sharer 1970).
Both sites have a full array of hunting, processing and fabricating
tools, and quantities of debris resulting from tool manufacture. It is
safe to assume that both are occupation sites and were the centers of
the various exploitative and procurement systems needed to maintain daily life. Data from the regional ethnography, and that ex-

Nunley 1971), indicate that the local groups on the Rio Grande Plain
roamed over a broad territory, camping at preferred sites for a few
weeks at a time. Such a pattern would account for the presence of
large occupation sites with widely dispersed debris found in the
area (Hester, White and White 1969: 163). The relationship among
such sites, or between these sites, and those with other functions
(workshops, foraging camps, etc.) can be best studied through the
examination of the archeological remains within a broad, welldefined research area. Such work is being carried on by Hester at
Chaparrosa Ranch (Hester 1970). In addition, we need more data on
culture sequence in this area, ideally with corresponding faunal
materials. Hill is continuing this avenue of research in the Tortugas
Creek and Chacon Creek drainages. Skinner (1971:257) has recently
suggested that it is now time for the emphasis in central Texas archeology to shift from chronology to studies of subsistence and settlement. This is in line with the most recent advances in American
archaeology (Binford 1968; Struever 1971; Gumerman 1971). While
we are concerned with settlement and subsistence, it is obvious that
such data will mean little unless it can be fitted into a chronological
framework. We have made much progress now in defining the Late
Prehistoric period on the Rio Grande Plain, but much work remains
to be done before the Archaic and even earlier cultural manifestations can be defined.
In closing, we would like to offer our observations on the effect of
vertisols at the Holdsworth Site. Although these dynamic soils have
the potential to vertically displace buried archeological materials,
we are unable to see any direct evidence of this happening at the
site. It is most likely that a larger artifact sample is required in order
to accurately evaluate the actions of vertisols. Duffield (1970) has
published a map which shows vertisols quite widely distributed in
the northwest part of the Rio Grande Plain. However, it appears that
these soils are somewhat more restricted than Duffield’s map indicates (Wayne Hamilton, personal communication). Archeologists
working in this region should consult local soil conservation service
technicians regarding the identification and interpretation of the
soils in their research areas.

A STUDY OF MODERN FLORA AND FAUNA IN THE
VICINITY OF THE HOLDSWORTH SITE

(41 ZV 14)
JOHN HOLDSWORTH

INTRODUCTION
A notable feature of Zavala County is its almost equal division by
the 100th meridian. By coincidence, this coordinate marks very
closely the eastward extent of the Great Plains, and therefore has
the effect of dividing of the United States into the east and west life
zones biologists generally recognize. While in Texas, the plains are
interrupted by the Balcones Fault, whose eroded face now constitutes, the Texas Hill Country. The Rio Grande Embayment or
Plains commence immediately below the fault zone, and though
some 1500 feet less in elevation, are essentially a continuation of the
steppe, or semiarid grassland, making up the higher plains areas.
The result is a considerable mixing of eastern and western species
of plants and animals. Climatological records also show alternating
periods of humid, subtropical conditions bringing about a more subtile exchange of species typical of the two climates.

66

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

There is, in addition, an overlapping of a number of species from
the tropics, sometimes persistent at other times casual, and still
others are more or less closely related to exotic forms. This mixing
from several directions creates in the area an altogether unusual
association of species (Blair 1950).

VEGETATIONAL PATTERNS
Effects of the coming of the Europeans have, of course, been
radical, the most immediate and conspicuous being the overgrazing
of the prairies. Even in 1777-78, Fr. Juan Agusti~ Morfi noted that
the vast herds of mustangs had depleted the range adjacent to the
waterings (Castafieda 1935). With later settlement, this was continued by cattle herds until certain species of grass were exterminated. Further, the lush growth of grass, which periodically
burned off, suppressed brush and tree seedlings. The thorn brush
chaparral has in this century spread from scattered thickets and
mottes, mainly along the watercourses, (see Fig. 9), until the former
grassland has been replaced in part by something resembling a
desert scrub condition (Gould 1969).
During historic times, Tortugas Creek has been an intermittent
stream, but there is some evidence it once had, in the vicinity of Site
41 ZV 14, a few seep springs that maintained a permanent
waterhole. A ledge of sandstone extending into the creek is of the
type associated with such springs elsewhere in south Texas. The
earlier Spanish travelers reported such a waterhole at a campsite
supposedly nearby (Inglis 1964:82). Large oaks of great age adjacent
to the creek may also support this theory.
Liveoaks of all sizes are found around the waterholes, along with
ash (Fraxinus berlandieriana), button bush (Cephalanthus occidentalis), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia) and occasionally the
mescal bean or frijolillo (Sophora secundiflora), whose seeds were
used by the Comanches as an emetic, "wild china" or soapberry
(Sapindus drummondii) and willow (Salix sp.). Until recent years the
small pepper called "chili piquin" (Capsicum baccatum) was plentiful in a few places. In overflows, small ponds and "hog wallows" a
coarse, tall grass called giant sacaton often forms a thick growth.
The cat-tail (Typha), now occurring in stock ponds nearby, may
have grown in these waterholes in earlier times. Water lilies were
known in a pond about a mile distant. The roots of these plants
could have been utilized as food.
In areas subject to overflow, where the soil is heavy and compact,

site, looking to the southwest. Note large trees and heavy vegetation on
right, paralleling Tortugas Creek. All excavation units were in
background, to right and left of standing figure.
the retama (Parkinsonia aculeata) may be dominant. The bean-like
seeds of this~small, slender tree related to the palo verde are said to
be edible. Broomweed (Xanthocephalum) occurs commonly in badly
eroded ground, as in washes along the creek.
Widespread in both the bottoms (channel and floodplain) and
uplands, the Mexican persimmon, mesquite and cat’s claw were
probably other sources of food to the early inhabitants. Seed pods of
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) are still used in Mexico to prepare a
nutritious paste known as mezquitamal containing about 30%
glucose (cf. Ruecking 1953:487). Acacia greggi, the long-flowered
cat’s claw, produces seed used by the Pimas and Papagos to make
pinole. The other species of Acacia, the round-flowered cat’s claw
(A. roemeriana), huisachilla (A. tortuosa), huajillo (A. berlandieri)
and blackbrush (A. amentacea) would likely have been similarly
useful. The last two species listed here are usually found at their
best on the uplands.

68

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

FIGURE 10. Typical Vegetation at the Holdsworth Site, 41 ZV 14.

Also very common, the granjeno (Celtis pallida) and various
species of buckthorn -- most importantly the brasil and the
squawbush -- of the genus Condalia produce quantities of small,
edible, sweet berries. On the uplands west of the creek in a more
alkaline soil, the ceniza (Leucophyllum texanum) is abundant, and
here also the creosote bush (Larrea) grows sparingly. Both shrubs
were thought to have medicinal value, and the creosote bush, here at
approximately its eastward limit, yielded a scale insect that was
made into a strong cement.
The extensive floodplain on the eastern side of the creek produces a number of cacti, principally the prickly pear (Opuntia
lindheimeri), the tasajillo (0. leptocaulis) and the petaya (Echinocereus
enneacanthus). The fruits of all these are held in rather high regard.
Two species of Echino-cactus and the pincushion cactus (Mammillaria) are also known in the area.

HOLDSWORTH/STEWART SITES

69

The guayacan (Porliera angustifolia), a lignum-vita, is plentiful
throughout this area and particularly on the floodplain where there
may also be found a scattering of all-thorns. The leaves of this
curious shrub are reduced to scales and their function taken over by
tough, green thorns and stems. The woods of these two are extremely hard. Another common shrub is thought to be "red berry"
(Schaefferia cuneffolia), whose small, numerous berries are edible.
Bee- or white-brush (Lippia lyciodes) grows sparingly here but in
some areas forms dense thickets. On sandy soils to the north a few
hundred yards, the lantana (Lantana horrida), supposedly poisonous,
may be found. Here, too, is the hog plum (Colubrina texensis). The
value of the black nutlets, if any, is not known, but, according to
local folklore, the bark was supposed to have some medicinal
property. The lighter soils are also favored by the two species of
Ephedra, one a climbing plant, the other a low, spreading shrub.
They are the sole representatives of the conifers in this area and are
known to live to a considerable age, possibly two centuries or more.
Though not seen in the immediate area, the coma (Bumelia
lyciodes) is common on the sandy uplands and gravelly terraces to
the east. This small tree of the Sapodilla family, resembling a
scrubby liveoak, produces a pea-sized berry with a sweet, rubbery
juice. In earlier times, children of Mexican extraction made
chewing gum from the berries, evidence of kinship with the tropical
Sapodilla which yields chicle.
Several plants with tuberous roots occur in the site area. These include the "flame flower" (Talinum lineare) which is small and inconspicuous above ground but has a large, edible tuber; the "four
o’clock" (Mirabilis) and the wild balsam (Ibervillea) both have
tuberous roots but it is not known if they are edible. The small wild
onion (Allium) is also thought to be present.
Other interesting plants of the general area are the leatherweed,
or "sangre de drago" (Jatropha spathulata), the chewing of the roots
of which was supposed to help gum disorders, the spanish dagger
(Yucca treculeana; see Fig. 10 for a view of Yucca sp. on the site),
provider of fiber as well as an edible flower and fruit, and the
maguey (Agave americana), whose various products are well known
(Castetter, Bell and Grove 1938).
From a sparse growth of buffalo grass (Buchlge) over the floodplain, the grass cover on the uplands improves to include various
bunch grasses (Trichloris, pink pappus grass, windmill grass, etc.),
curley mesquite (Hilaria), three-awn grass (Aristida), hairy grama
(Bouteloua), burr grass (Cenchrus) and others.

70

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
FAUNA

Land snails are common in the area, thriving particularly where
the soil is strongly alkaline. In the larger waterholes, the mussel of
the genus Unio may survive by estivation through periods of drouth.
Crayfish are found in backwaters and tributaries not reached by
fish.
About 4 miles downstream, a permanent lake (Woodward Lake)
of some size formed a reservoir of fish, which migrated upstream to
the site area during freshets lasting a week or two. Principal among
them were the catfishes, the black bass, sunfish (Lepomis), gar
(Lepisosteus) and the buffalo (Ictiobus). Bullfrogs (Rana catesbiana)
and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) are plentiful, as are common and
Fowler toads (Bufo sp.).
It is probable that a few alligators also occurred in the creek at
one time, as they have been reported even in recent years along the
Nueces River drainage. A variety of water turtles are still known.
The snapper and soft shell must be considered very rare but the
slider (Pseudemys) and mud turtle (Kinosternum) are numerous. On
land the gopher tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri) is plentiful, and the
western box turtle (Terrapene ornata) is seen at odd intervals. The
best known lizards, all small, are the horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), the spiny swift (Sceloporus) and the racerunner
(Cnemidophorus). Best known of the larger snakes are the coachwhip
(Masticophis), the indigo snake (Drymarchon corals), which may
reach 8 feet in length, the bull snake (Pituophis melanoleucus),
measuring as much as 7 feet, the water snake (Natrix), and the
western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox).
Any number of migratory waterfowl may be seen at some time in
the area (cf. Leopold 1959). Woodward Lake, mentioned above, was
considered in pioneer days to be an outstanding duck-shooting
location. Coots and gallinules are seen there today, along with a
variety of surface-feeding ducks, great blue herons, green herons
and other waders and shore birds. In the early days of Anglo settlement, the upland plover and curlew were favorite game birds,
though now they are not often seen. The once familiar wood stork
(Mycteria americana) no longer visits the area.
As the character of the land changed (from grassland to
brushland), it became less suitable for the bobwhite quail, while the
scaled quail (Callipela squamata), a bird of the typical southwestern
scrub, found itself better adapted to this region. Although the turkey
does not thrive as a rule in this type of country, the liveoak bottoms
(channel microenvironment) provide ample quantities of mast and
other forage to support a fair number of the birds. The Aguayo Ex-

HOLDSWORTH/STEWART SITES

71

pedition of 1722 reported many turkeys, "peacocks" (apparently
strutting gobblers), quail and rabbits on Tortugas Creek (Inglis 1964:
82). Other game birds include the mourning dove (Zenaidura) and
the white-winged dove (Zenaida), although the latter is now quite
rare. Meadowlarks are numerous in fall and winter.
Several hawks are known in the area, but only Harris’s hawk
(Parabuteo unicinctus), the red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and
Swainson’s hawk (B. swainsoni) are seen regularly. The golden eagle
and Audubon’s caracara (C. cheriway) are rare visitors. The two
species of vulture, the great horned owl and the barn owl are all
common. The burrowing owl (Speotyto), another victim of changing
conditions, is rarely seen nowadays. The barred owl (Strix varia)
may be heard occasionally in the more heavily wooded bottoms.
The roadrunner, a terrestrial cuckoo, maintains a reasonable
population.
During the early Anglo-Hispanic settlement of the region, the
nine-banded armadillo was a standard food item, and the fact this is
no longer the case (along with the reduction of predators), probably
accounts for its very noticeable increase in the last half century.
Raccoons are also, for similar reasons, now very common along the
creek. Skunks and badgers represent the weasel family, with infrequent reports of the long-tailed weasel (Mustela ffenata). Also
present is the Mexican opposum (D. marsupialis). The gray fox is
sighted occasionally and characteristically keeps to the wooded
strips of the channel microenvironment. The coyote persists in
some numbers, depending on the energy devoted to predator control
in this general area.
Up to about fifty years ago, the jaguar was known to wander
across the border at rare intervals and enter the Tortugas country,
while the ocelot and margay cat (and even bear) were seen
somewhat more often. The mountain lion has been reported more
recently, keeping to the wooded bottoms and sometimes crossing
from one stream to the other. It was never considered more than a
transient, however. The only native wild cat considered an
established resident is the bobcat, which is rather common.
Hoofed mammals now known in the area include only the whitetailed deer (Odocoileus texanus) and the white-collared peccary
(Pecari angulatus), another displaced exotic, which the early settlers
found very numerous. Whether the bison occurred here in recent
centuries is conjectural. The early Spaniards reported them at no
great distance, one sighting ~ictually being made within the county
(Inglis 1964:89), if it is possible to judge with any particular time.
Later explorers did not see them, and they were certainly gone by
the time of the first settlers. It appears, then, that the bison was
never common here in historical times. Probably the same conclusion may be reached for the pronghorn antelope (Inglis 1964:89).

Rodents are numerous along Tortugas Creek, especially in the
channel microenvironment. Although the Mexican ground squirrel
(Citellus mexicanus) is the only species of gopher, and the fox
squirrel is rare, the southern plains wood rat (Neotoma micropus), a
robust animal measuring about 14 inches over all, is very plentiful,
several "houses" often visible at once in bushes or cacti. The
kangaroo rat (Dipodomys) leaves its curious footprints in the sand,
though seldom seen itself. Three species of small mice have been
reported, and the remains of the larger hispid pocket mouse
(Perognathus hispidus) has been found in the nests of hawks. The
cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) occurs in certain moist localities in
the channel microenvironment.
Two species of cottontail (Sylvilagus) are present along the Tortugas channel and on the floodplain. The hardy black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) is ever-present, though seeming to go through
irregular population cycles not necessarily related to the food supply. It ranges through all microenvironments.

A preliminary study of a collection of faunal materials from the
Holdsworth Site (41 ZV 14) is presented here. A total of 334 pieces
were examined, 242 of which are unidentifiable (see Table 1). The

use of fine-mesh screens in the excavations permitted a high
recovery of small faunal materials. Preservation of the remains is
excellent, although most exhibit fracturing and charring/burning attributable to the use of the represented animals as food items.
Identification and distribution of faunal remains are given in
Table 1. Since interpretations have already been presented in the
main paper, I would just like to register my opinion that most of the
unidentifiable bones represent the whitetail deer. Most of these
fragments are thick splinters, indicating that deer bones at the site
were comminuted to obtain marrow. If this assumption is granted, it
is apparent that the major meat source for the prehistoric occupations was deer. The small mammals probably served as supplements to the meat diet unless, of course, the various species
represent seasonal preferences.
Identification of the faunal remains was facilitated through the
use of comparative collections of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology
and those of the Archaeological Research Facility, Berkeley.
