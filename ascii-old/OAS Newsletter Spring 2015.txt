MISSION STATEMENT

T

through public education, research, conservation and
enhanced opportunities for responsible participation in
archaeology for interested individuals and organizations.

OUR HISTORY

T

he Oklahoma Anthropological Society (OAS) came
into existence in 1952 as a focus for people having
interests in the history and prehistory of humans in
Oklahoma. The Cleveland chapter, in Norman, OK, was
also founded in 1952 and is the oldest continuously active chapter. Subsequently, other groups were established
in other Oklahoma cities, and a state organization was
created. Now, with a history of more than 60 years, OAS
has ten Chapters throughout Oklahoma. and has developed many programs, research projects, and activities.

A quarterly publication of the
Oklahoma Anthropological Society.

OAS INITIATIVES
GET INVOLVED IN OKALHOMA ARCHAEOLOGY MONTH (OAM)

O

klahoma Archaeology Month (OAM) is a month-long,
statewide celebration of the archaeology of Oklahoma.
Through enthusiastic engagement in outreach programs--such
as museum tours, open lab days, hands-on demonstrations of
traditional skills--our goal is to increase the knowledge of and
appreciation for the archaeology of Oklahoma, as well as to build
stronger relationships between the professional archaeological
communities and the public they serve.
Celebrations of this second Oklahoma Archaeology Month will
take place throughout the month of October 2015. Last year’s inaugural event schedule was so successful that we are designing
this year’s program within thematic weeks:
• Oct 1-4: Parks
• Oct 5-11: Museums and cultural centers.
• Oct 12-18: Labs/departments and business open-houses.
• Oct 19-25: Historic Homes.
• Oct 26-31: Miscellaneous
We need members to join in on the celebrations! Please contact
Stephanie Stutts with questions about Oklahoma Archaeology
Month and how you or your chapter can participate.

Using artifacts, Asa Randall (PhD) teaches the public how
archaeology is a systematic way to learn about past cultures.

JOIN OAS Archaeological Advocate Network (OASAAN)

P

roject Archaeology (PA) is a joint national program of the
Bureau of Land Management and Montana State University whose goal is to bring archaeology education into every
classroom in America. To accomplish this, Project Archaeology
staff write curriculum guides for grade school teachers and get
those guides into the hands of teachers through their network
of volunteers across the nation who teach professional development workshops and participate in archaeology outreach in
their areas.

Using OASAAN as a resource, Project Archaeology teaches
educators that archaeology is a systematic way to learn about
past cultures. OASAAN advocate, Holly Andrew, classifies
doohickeys with Oklahoma teachers. Photograph by Ryan
Howell.

For more information about this new and
upcoming program contact: Meghan Forney
at meghan.forney@ou.edu.

In 2014, PA came to Oklahoma. The PA program in our state
is unique from all others in the nation through its partnership
with OAS. Together, we are developing the OAS Archaeological
Advocate Network (OASAAN) that will train OAS members to
be mentors to teachers who have participated in PA workshops.
OASAAN participants will be a local resource for teachers after
a workshop, who can answer questions and engage students in
classroom visits. Stay tuned to learn more!

OVER HILL, OVER DALE:
PALEOINDIANS IN THE WESTERN
OUACHITA MOUNTAINS
by Stephanie Stutts

4 | OAS Newsletter

RESEARCH QUESTION…

T

he uplands of the western Ouachita Mountains in
eastern Oklahoma are an understudied area, surrounded by reported Paleoindian (date range) sites. By
researching the published and unpublished Paleoindian
sites in the upland areas of the western Ouachitas and
comparing these sites to those reported from the neighboring river valleys and the eastern Ouachitas of Arkansas, it is apparent that, rather than a no-(wo)man’s
land, these highland areas have yet to yield the full potential of sites, due to a lack of archaeological study and
much is yet to be gained from archaeological survey.

WHY IT’S INTERESTING…
Mountain archaeology is coming into its own, especially in western North America. But in the Mid-continent
and the Southeast, this area of research is just bginning.
By doing archaeological research in montane environments that have previously been unexplored, we can
potentially add a whole suite of human behavior to our
understanding of Paleoindian life. The western Ouachitas of Oklahoma are particularly intriguing because
they are on the border of three ecological zones—the
Southern Plains, the Eastern Woodlands, and the Gulf
Coast Plains. In such ecotonal regions, there is high
potential for multifaceted subsistence and mobility patterns, as well as cultural interactions. Thus, the lack of
archaeological understanding in this area is more an
artifact of a lack of research than a lack of Paleoindian
occupation.

Oklahoma archaeologists, in the Paleoindian Lab at the OU
Norman campus.

FUTURE RESEARCH…
Because of the lack of previous research in the area,
I need to find a way to get to know the region’s archaeological resources in a quick and reliable way.
So I would like to do an artifact road show in eastern
Oklahoma this summer I’m inviting the community to come out, show their collections, and get their
projectile points identified by archaeologists. This
will help me tremendously by giving me a real sense
of the kinds of points that are cropping up in the
area, as well as an idea of the kinds of stone materials
being used to make these points. This information
will help in forming future research questions and in
identifying the most fruitful areas for survey.

NEW BOOKS

S

urvey faculty member
Leland Bement, along
with co-author Brian Carter from OSU, has a chapter
entitled “From Mammoth
to Bison: Changing Clovis
Prey Availability at the End
of the Pleistocene” in the
just-released Texas A&M
University Press book “Clovis: On the Edge of a New
Understanding” edited by
Ashley M. Smallwood and
Thomas A. Jennings. Their
chapter covers the discovery, excavation, and analysis
of Oklahoma’s second-only
Clovis site; the Jake Bluff bison kill located near Woodward. Jake Bluff is the largest
bison kill site attributed to
Clovis anywhere in North
America and represents an
adaptation by Clovis hunters to changing prey avail-

ability after mammoths went extinct.
Survey faculty member, Amanda Regnier, recently published her book: “Reconstructing Tascalusa’s Cheifdom”
through the University of Alabama Press. It focuses on
the social history of the Alabama River Valley and uses
ceramic analysis to evaluate the nature of regional Late
Prehistoric political organization and leadership.
