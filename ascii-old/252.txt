ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey for an oil and gas pipeline in DeWitt County, Texas
was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) from May 10-23,
2011. This study investigated the entry and exit points on both banks of the
Guadalupe River and Sandies Creek as well as an upland area overlooking
Sandies Creek. A small portion of the project area is located in the Cuero I
Archeological District. One prehistoric site (41DW284) was found on the upland
ridge overlooking Sandies Creek to the north. This is a quarry or lithic procurement
site that may also have served as a temporary camp. This statement is based on
the presence of sandy soil, late stage flakes, and a biface that exhibited use wear
and organic material that suggests food preparation and/or consumption. Large
tested cobbles were observed, and numerous flakes (some burned) of all reduction
stages were scattered about the site. The presence of a reworked dart point is
evidence of a possible Archaic occupation. This site has been greatly disturbed
through previous pipeline construction and the removal of vegetation in order to
create a working easement for an existing pipeline. Site 41DW284 is not
considered eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, and further
work is not considered necessary. The size of the area investigated is 1.33 acres.
The artifacts have been returned to the landowner, and the records have been
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory on the campus of The
University of Texas at Austin. Copies of the report are on file at the United States
Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District; Texas Historical Commission; Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory; Texas State Library; BVRA; CSC Engineering;
and DCP Midstream.

INTRODUCTION
DCP Midstream, LP of Houston, Texas proposes to install two sixteeninch pipelines in DeWitt County for the purposed of transporting oil and gas from
Central Gathering Point 81 to Central Gathering Point 82 (Figure 1). The lead
agency for this project is the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston
District and Jerry L. Androy is the agency reviewer. William E. Moore is the
Principal Investigator, and the field survey was conducted under the supervision
of James E. Warren who was the Project Archaeologist. The environmental firm
for this project is CSC Engineering and Consulting, and Stephen M. Swetish is
the biologist representing this firm. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is depicted
on the USGS 7.5â topographic quadrangle Cuero (2997-121) (Figure 2).
This project involves the installation of two pipelines placed 15 feet apart for
a distance of approximately 19.9 miles with part of the route cross-country. The
trenches for the pipes will be 30 inches wide have 48 inches of cover. There will be
a permanent easement of 50 feet and a temporary easement of 40 feet. The pipes
will cross the Guadalupe River, Sandies Creek, and some minor streams. The high
probability areas for this project are the crossings at the Guadalupe River and
Sandies Creek and a hill overlooking Sandies Creek (Figure 3). The streams will be
crossed by horizontal directional boring at an average depth of 10 feet. The entry
point for the Guadalupe River crossing is located 290 feet from the east bank of the
river, and the exit point is located 260 feet from the west bank of the river. The
entry point for the Sandies Creek crossing is located 310 feet from the north bank
of the creek, and the exit point is located 240 feet from the south bank of the creek.
Since an archaeological site was found on the hill overlooking Sandies Creek, the
pipeline will be placed at the base of the hill in order to avoid impacting this site. A
portion of the project area is located in the Cuero I Archeological District (Figure 2).

ENVIRONMENT
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal section of the
Coastal Plain Phyisiographic Province (Fox et al. 1974:5). The topography in this
province is characterized by gently to rolling hills and a land surface that slopes
to the Gulf of Mexico. The areas of greatest local relief are along the river valleys
and their tributaries. The Guadalupe River is the major stream in the county, and
it flows from its headwaters in the Edwards Plateau to the Gulf of Mexico via the
San Antonio Bay to the southeast. It meanders in a wide floodplain along a
broad valley lined with alluvial terraces (United States Department of the Interior
1960:2). About four miles north of Cuero, the floodplain of the Guadalupe River
is about two miles wide. Flooding on the Guadalupe River is a reflection of the
yearly rainfall pattern, and it is most common as a result of thunderstorms. The
river in the vicinity of the project area (looking downstream) is depicted on the
cover.
Climatic data were taken from a report prepared by the DeWitt County
Commissioners Court (1973). The area is humid subtropical with hot summers.
Local weather is dominated by tropical maritime air masses that are present in
the spring, summer, and fall and is somewhat diminished by polar air masses in
the winter. In the summer, temperatures are somewhat constant and rarely
exceed 90ï°. Rainfall is most common in late spring and early fall. Winter
temperatures are also rather constant, and freezes are rare. Precipitation usually
occurs in the form of light rain or drizzle. In the spring, the weather is warmer,
but it can be interspersed with brief cold spells. Thunderstorms are the main
form of precipitation, and they are most common in May. Vegetation takes many
forms in the county (DeWitt County Commissioners Court 1973). In general,
native vegetation in the uplands consists of prairie grasses, mesquite, hackberry,
elm, and oak. On the riverbanks there is a variety of flora that includes prairie
grasses, mesquite, huisache, elm, and pecan.
The low topographic relief of the uplands in the area is formed by residual
soils that developed on southeasterly dipping geologic strata that are Miocene
and Eocene in age (Fox et al. 1974:5). Upland soils that can be found in the
general area consist of clayey and loamy soils that formed under a native cover
of grasses and loamy and sandy soils that formed under a savannah or
woodland vegetative cover (Fox et al. 1974:5). Descriptions from the soils
specific to this project were provided by soil scientist Laurie Kiniry at the United
States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service office in
Temple, Texas and the soil survey for DeWitt County (Miller 1978).

At the crossing of the Guadalupe River, the east bank consists of Megiun
soils, frequently flooded (Mf); while the west bank consists of Megiun silty clay
loam, occasionally flooded (Me). The latter (Me soils) is described in the soil
survey as occurring on floodplains of rivers. The parent material is calcareous
loamy alluvium that is well drained, and the depth to available water is greater
than 60 inches. The description of Mf soils is the same as Me soils. The soils
found on the both banks of Sandies Creek are Megiun silty clay loam,
occasionally flooded (Me). The soil in the upland area overlooking Sandies Creek
is Buchel clay, occasionally flooded (Bu). According to the soil survey, this soil is
a calcareous loamy alluvium that is well drained, and the depth to available water
is greater than 60 inches.
Within the confines of the river valley walls, there are at least two terrace
systems. The terrace at the higher elevation is known as a âfossil floodplain.â
The modern terrace is subject to flooding. Relict features of the landscape in the
area of the modern terrace system includes meander scars, âcut-offâ lakes, and
remnants of natural levees and point bars characterize both floodplains.
Numerous colluvial deposits of siliceous gravels are present on the lower
slopes of the uplands. It is believed that they are the result of erosion along from
the slopes of the adjacent upland terraces. Exposures of gravels are sometimes
found in portions of the fossil floodplains, and extensive deposits of gravels cover
the more elevated Catahoula and Oakville sandstone formations in some areas.

METHODS
This project was performed in order to identify any cultural resources that
might be present within the route of the proposed pipelines at the point where
they cross the Guadalupe River, Sandies Creek, and an upland area overlooking
Sandies Creek to the north. Prior to entering the field, the site records at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
were checked for the presence of previously recorded archaeological sites in the
project area and vicinity as well as previous projects performed by professional
archaeologists. The APE for this project consists of the entry and exit points at the
Guadalupe River, Sandies Creek, and the high ground that overlooks Sandies
Creek. The pipeline crosses other streams, but they were evaluated in the field and
determined to be ephemeral and not likely to contain significant sites. In order to
examine the subsurface at the stream crossings to a sufficient depth, a backhoe
was used and one trench was excavated at each entry point and exit point. The
high ground overlooking Sandies Creek was examined by a thorough surface
inspection and shovel testing. The fieldwork was documented by a sketch map of
each area, field notes, profiles of the backhoe trenches, log of photographs taken,
shovel test log, and digital photographs. At each backhoe trench, selected samples
of dirt were screened using quarter-inch hardware cloth, and the profiles of each
trench were scraped with a trowel and examined for cultural materials and features.
The excavated soil from shovel tests was screened using Â¼ inch hardware cloth,
and Information relating to the shovel tests was entered onto a log (Appendix I). In
all, nine shovel tests were excavated. A visual inspection of the minor streams and
tributaries revealed the presence of clay at the surface, and there were no deposits
of gravels that would have been suitable for making stone tools. Therefore, these
areas were not considered worthy of a formal subsurface investigation.
Guadalupe River Crossing (Area 1)
Backhoe Trench 1 was dug at the entry point on the east bank of the river,
oriented east west, and located 290 feet from the water (Figure 4). The trench
was dug through sandy clay loam (10YR 3/1) from 0-40 cm, sandy clay loam
(10YR 4/2) from 40 to 71 cm, and fine sandy loam (10YR 5/2) from 71 cm to the
bottom of the trench at 175 cm. The dimensions of the trench are 4.5 meters
long and 60 centimeters wide. The north profile of the trench is depicted in
Appendix II (Backhoe Trench Profiles), and a photograph of the trench during
excavation is depicted in Appendix III entitled Backhoe Trench Photographs.

Backhoe Trench 2 was dug at the exit point on the west bank of the river,
oriented east west, and located 260 feet from the water (Figure 4). The trench
was dug through clay (10YR 3/1) from 0-40 cm, sandy clay (10YR 4/3) from 4090 cm, and sandy clay loam from 90 to the bottom of the trench at 180 cm. The
dimensions of the trench are 4.2 meters long and 60 centimeters wide. The
northeast profile of the trench is depicted in Appendix II (Backhoe Trench
Profiles), and a photograph of the trench during excavation is depicted in
Appendix III entitled Backhoe Trench Photographs.
Sandies Creek Crossing (Area 2)
Backhoe Trench 3 was excavated at the entry point on the north bank of
the creek, oriented northeast/southwest, and located 310 feet from the water
(Figure 5). The trench was dug through three soil types. Clay (10YR 3/1) was
present from 0-45 cm, sandy clay (10YR 4/3) was encountered at 45-85 cm, and
sandy clay loam (10YR 5/3) was present from 85 cm to the bottom of the trench
at 182 cm. The dimensions of the trench are 4.6 meters long and 63 centimeters
wide. The northwest profile of the trench is depicted in Appendix II (Backhoe
Trench Profiles), and a photograph of the trench during excavation is depicted in
Appendix III entitled Backhoe Trench Photographs.
Backhoe Trench 4 was excavated at the exit point on the south bank of
the creek, oriented northeast southwest, and located 240 feet from the water
(Figure 5). The first 30 cm consisted of sandy loam (10YR 3/1) that continued to
a depth of 110 cm. Coarse sand (10YR 6/1) was encountered from 110 cm to
160 cm, and this was followed by sandy loam (10YR 3/4) to the bottom of the
trench at 182 cm. The dimensions of the trench are 4.2 meters long and 60 cm
wide. The northwest profile of the trench is depicted in Appendix II (Backhoe
Trench Profiles), and a photograph of the trench during excavation is depicted in
Appendix III entitled Backhoe Trench Photographs.
High Ground Overlooking Sandies Creek (Area 3)
This area was investigated by a surface inspection of the exposed surface
and shovel testing (Figure 6). The crew walked over the entire APE and examined
the disturbed surface for cultural materials. Once it was determined that a
prehistoric site was present, they began shovel testing. The tests were dug through
sandy loam and fine sandy loam until a lens of natural gravels was encountered.
Several formal tools were collected from the surface. The east-west boundary of
the site was established by the landform that drops off steeply on each end and the
three negative tests. Later, the Principal Investigator, the Project Archaeologist,
and William A. Dickens visited the site in order to allow Dr. Dickens to collect a
sample of cobbles and observe the kinds of material present. The valve station is
the only fixed point in the site area. Therefore, the distance from it to shovel tests 2
and 3 was measured to enhance the accuracy of the site map.

CULTURE SEQUENCE
According to a statistical overview published by the Texas Historical
Commission in 1985 (Biesaart et al. 1985), DeWitt County is located in the
Central Coastal Plain Cultural-Geographical Region of Texas. At the time the
overview was published, there were 1067 known sites in the region (5.28% of the
state). Paleo-Indian sites numbered 26, Archaic sites numbered 285, and Late
Prehistoric sites numbered 226. According to Fox et al. (1974:21), there were
only twelve recorded sites in the county prior to the survey for the proposed
Cuero I Reservoir. When the statistical overview was published, 182 sites had
been recorded in the county, and they accounted for 17.05% of the region and
.90% of the state. These sites are listed in the overview as Paleo-Indian (n=3),
Early Archaic (n=3), Middle Archaic (n=9), Late Archaic (n=8), General Archaic
(n=20), and Late Prehistoric (n=20). Sites listed in the National Register of
Historic Places are confined to the city limits of Cuero. Disturbance to sites in the
county is described as consisting of erosion, construction, dispersed, and
vandalism. As of 1985, no sites had been subjected to formal excavation.
Twelve sites had been tested by hand, and 177 sites had been surface collected.
Subsistence features include two hearths, six burned rock features, one shell
midden, and four areas with midden soil. Three burials were known at the time.
The vast majority of site types in the county were quarries (n=164).
Paleo-Indian Stage
The traditional view of this segment of Texas prehistory has been that of
small bands of hunters pursuing mammoth, mastodon, and other species of
megafauna. The stone tools most associated with these groups are distinctive
projectile points known as Clovis and Folsom. Sites with artifacts that date to this
period are rare, but Folsom, Plainview, and San Patrice points (referred to by
Albert J. Redder as Brazos Fishtail) were found at two shelters (41BQ46 and
41BQ47) in Bosque County (Watt 1978). These sites are viewed as Late PaleoIndian since radiocarbon dates place the earliest deposit containing the San
Patrice points at circa 8000 B.C. Another significant aspect of these sites is that
they contained stratified deposits from the Paleo-Indian Stage through the Late
Prehistoric Stage. In general, Paleo-Indian finds are restricted to the surface in
conditions that do not allow them to be associated with a known site.

12

Archaic Stage
This period is defined by most archaeologists as a bridge between the
past lifeways of the Paleo-Indians and the Late Prehistoric groups that came
next. One of the markers of the Archaic is an increase in population as indicated
by more sites. There was a greater variety of projectile points used and the
fauna that was exploited are modern species. Sites of this period consist of
campsites, rockshelters, burned rock middens and mounds, and lithic quarries.
An excellent discussion of the Texas Archaic can be found in âCultural
Chronology in Central Texasâ by Elton R. Prewitt (1981). Although some of his
data may not apply to the current theories, his article remains a good overview of
the area.
Late Prehistoric Stage
This is the final period of Texas prehistory, and it dates from circa A.D.
1300 to A.D. 1750 (Prewitt 1981:84). The major changes from the Archaic to the
Late Prehistoric are the introduction of the bow and arrow, ceramics, and some
agriculture in certain parts of the state. In Central Texas, it is represented by the
Austin and Toyah phases. Key markers are Perdiz and Scallorn arrow points,
end scrapers, four-beveled knives, Leon Plain ceramics, and cemeteries. This
stage ended when contact was made with European explorers in the 1700s.
Historic Indians
One of the issues that confront archaeologists is the association of sites
with known historic Indian bands. In the 19th century, Central Texas was mainly
inhabited by the intrusive Comanche who arrived from the plains to the north, the
Apache who came from the west, and the Tonkawa whom some believe were the
descendents of those who occupied some of the prehistoric sites in the area.
Without direct association of artifacts that can be dated to the historic period, any
statement would only be speculation. Fox et al. (1974:15) mention two lesserknown bands that inhabited the region. These are the autonomous Coahuiltecanspeaking Aranama and Tamique. During historic times, the âCoahuiltecans in the
Guadalupe River basin represented the northern range of a much larger group of
bands which extended from the area well into Mexicoâ (Fox et al. 1974:15).
Historic Indian sites are rarely found, and the main body of data regarding groups
of this period is from accounts by local historians such as J. W. Wilbargerâs
(1889) Indian Depredations in Texas and Andrew Jackson Sowellâs (1900) Early
Settlers and Indian Fighters of Southwest Texas.

13

Historic Period
The first major settlement in DeWitt County was by colonists who made
their homes in DeWittâs colony in 1825 (Rather 1904). By the mid-1930s, all of
the land along the Guadalupe River between Gonzales and present-day Cuero
had been distributed to the colonists of DeWittâs colony. There were two major
centers of settlement, and both are in the current boundaries of DeWitt County.
These were a homestead by Arthur Burns and his wife near Irish Creek and the
âUpper Settlementâ located between McCoy and Cuero creeks on the east bank
of the Guadalupe River. The first settlers of the âUpper Settlementâ arrived in
1827. By 1846, this settlement became the first town in DeWitt County and was
known as Concrete (Murphee n.d.). DeWitt County was created in 1846 after the
Republic of Texas became part of the United States of America. By 1870, the
town of Concrete had seven stores, a shoe shop, blacksmith shop, hotel, gin, two
churches, Masonic lodge, post office, and a college. In 1873, the town of Cuero
became the center of economic activity because it was the only railroad terminus
in the county, and Concrete declined in importance. The current economy is tied
to agriculture, ranching, dairy products, and recreation (hunting and fishing).
Cuero is the county seat, and the population of the county (according to the 2000
census) was 20,067 (Dallas Morning News 2004).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The project area is located within the Cuero I Archeological District that
was established in 1974 and based on the large number of sites found during a
joint survey by the Texas Historical Commission and Texas Water Development
Board in 1972 and 1973 (Fox et al. 1974). There are numerous sites that are
listed in the National Register of Historic Places located within this district, but not
one of these sites is in the current project area. Prior to the current survey, there
were 283 recorded sites in DeWitt County, and the last one (41DW283) was
recorded by SWCA in 2011 as a lithic scatter with no diagnostic artifacts. There
are three recorded sites within one mile of the current project area. These are
41DW232, 41DW248, and 41DW259. All are prehistoric and consist of a
campsite, a quarry site, and a lithic scatter.
Site 41DW232 was recorded by Robert J. Mallouf and Daniel E. Fox in
1973 as an extensive campsite located on a prominent sand terrace on the east
side of the Guadalupe River about 1.25 miles west of Cuero. It is 0.25 mile
upstream from the confluence of the river and Sandies Creek just above a
historic ferry crossing. The area of occupation was estimated by the recorders,
as at least 100 meters long, and it appears that this statement is based on the
size of the landform since they did no subsurface exploration and only observed
a few flakes and one piece of bone on backdirt from gopher burrows. No report
is mentioned, and it is assumed they visited this site based on a request from the
landowner or acting on information provided by another source. They state that
further investigation is advised.
Site 41DW248 was recorded in 1982 by Laura H. Trawick who was a
member of the Texas Archeological Society. No report is mentioned on the site
form. Therefore, it is assumed that she visited and recorded it on her personal
time. The site is located on the remnant of a detached terrace of the Guadalupe
River. She describes the site as a light lithic scatter with some possible burned
rock. The size of the site was estimated as being 20 meters by 30 meters, and
this is based on her surface inspection. Artifacts observed include flakes, biface
perform, and chert cobbles. There may be intact deposits in the sandy mantle on
top of the terrace.

15

Site 41DW259 was recorded in 1987 by Wayne C. Young of the State
Department of Highways and Public Transportation (now Texas Department of
Highways and Transportation. The site is described as an upland quarry on a hill
overlooking the Guadalupe River floodplain. The soil was black clay over a lens
of gravels over an area of 75 meters by 75 meters. The size was based on the
surface inspection. Artifacts observed include cores, a few flakes, and some
burned rock. It is described as a âshallow, low-density lithic procurement site for
early reduction of local flint cobbles,â and Young states that it is similar to upland
sites in nearby Fayette County. This site was recorded during an in-house study
associated with the widening of Farm-to-Market Road 3402. Youngâs report and
the artifacts are housed at the Texas Department of Transportation in Austin.
The site was not viewed as significant.

16

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin, Texas and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas revealed no previously
recorded sites have been recorded within any portion of the APE, and no previous
archaeological projects or surveys had been conducted in the area. The local flora
at the time consisted mainly of intrusive plants that occupy areas where the native
vegetation was removed for agricultural practices. One area, however, may be a
remnant of the original vegetation. Figure 7 depicts an oak forest and its understory
on the south bank of Sandies Creek in the area of Backhoe Trench 4.

Figure 7. Vegetation at Backhoe Trench 4
Backhoe trenches were excavated where the pipeline is planned to cross
the Guadalupe River and Sandies Creek, and they were negative in terms of
recovering cultural materials. The soils at the Guadalupe River consisted of sandy
clay loam over fine sandy loam (Backhoe Trench 1) and clay and sandy clay over
sandy clay loam (Backhoe Trench 2) at the Guadalupe River crossing. At the
crossing of Sandies Creek, the soils consisted of clay and sandy clay over sandy
clay loam (Backhoe Trench 3) and sandy clay loam/sandy loam over coarse sand
(Backhoe Trench 4).

17

On the upland area overlooking Sandies Creek, the soil does not appear to
be consistent with Buchel clay, occasionally flooded as described in the soil survey
for DeWitt County. This high probability area is located at the 300-foot contour, and
it does not seem likely that it would be subject to flooding given the relief above the
floodplain of Sandies Creek and the distance to that stream. According to Laurie
Kiniry, the soil description covers the entire mapping unit and may not be correct
for all areas within that unit.
One prehistoric site (41DW284) was recorded on a high hill overlooking the
floodplain of Sandies Creek 1.37 kilometers to the north. This site is defined in this
report as a quarry site with a possible quarry camp present. The only indicator of
age is a re-worked dart point that would typically be associated with an Archaic site.
Because its original shape is not known, it is impossible to assign it to a known
type. However, there are enough similarities between it and the Ensor point to
speculate that it might be an example of that type. Large cobbles were present on
the surface and throughout the shovel tests. Testing was terminated when the
crew encountered a very dense and compact layer of cobbles that was impossible
to remove using shovels. Evidence of the area having been used as a quarry site
is present in the form of tested cobbles and primary flakes. In Shovel Test 6, many
small interior flakes were recovered. This suggests that bifaces and other tools
may have been made and/or refurbished. Also, many of the flakes were burned. It
is possible that the groups who visited this site to obtain raw materials for making
stone tools also camped there and made bifaces to take with them to their base
camp where they would be fashioned into formal tools. The artifacts from this site
were analyzed by William A. Dickens, and his findings are presented in Appendix V.
The soil at this site does not appear to exactly match the description in the soil
survey for DeWitt County. The site is located at the 300-foot contour, and it does
not seem likely that this area would be subject to flooding given the distance to
Sandies Creek. According to Laurie Kiniry, the soil description covers the entire
mapping unit and may not be correct for all areas within that unit.
Quarry sites represent an important part of the archaeological record. Often,
these sites are not well documented in the literature. Quarry sites provide useful
data regarding the kinds of raw materials found in the area and the quality of these
materials. When detached flakes are present, these sites can offer insight into the
amount of reduction conducted. Unfortunately, quarries are often under reported in
the literature. It is not uncommon for the only information in a report to simply state
that cobbles and primary flakes constitute the artifact inventory. Carlson (1993:57)
states that an understanding of the entire site is necessary in order to evaluate its
significance and the various tasks that could have been performed. In order to
properly evaluate a quarry site, Carlson advises that several tasks are necessary.
These are defining the context of the site in terms of its geological and geographic
setting; mapping the extent of the quarry within that context; and obtaining a
stratified random sample of the archaeological materials to define both the
technological variability and identify patterning in regards to material preference,
cultural activities, and quarry product.

18

The information gained from a study of this kind will be limited if no
diagnostics are recovered. However, gross temporal uses may be identified on the
basis of quarry technology and blank production.
Carlson also states that there are no standard methods for investigating
quarry sites, and field methods vary according to the type of site present. The two
most common ways of examining a quarry are a controlled surface collection and
test units. Examples of obtaining a sample of materials at quarry sites in Texas are
provided in reports by Assad (1978), Bond (1978), and McGraw and Valdez (1978).
The surface collection by McGraw and Valdez (1978) consisted of a twenty-five
meter square grid system over an area of two hundred square meters. Six of the
units were randomly selected in order to obtain a ten percent sample of the site. All
artifacts were âpiece plottedâ within each grid unit, and two additional squares were
selected non-randomly. All artifacts observed within these units were collected.
According to Carlson, the information obtained from a quarry site should
include overall density and size grade of the materials, counts of cores, flakes, and
bifaces compared to unmodified pieces, types of cores and degree of reduction,
variability and condition of the material, and discrete scatters of flakes. Also, chert
source sampling should emphasize qualitative variables such as size range of the
nodules, color, texture, variability, and any diagnostic characteristics (e.g., fossils,
banding, etc.) that may help to identify the source, and color change as a result of
burning.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Site 41DW284 is not considered eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places or designation as a State Archeological Landmark. Therefore, it is
recommended that construction of the pipeline be allowed to proceed as planned
without further consultation with the Texas Historical Commission. Should
evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during the proposed
construction, all work must stop until the regulatory agencies are notified and the
situation evaluated. If the route of the pipeline is moved to another area, the
regulatory agencies must be informed, as additional survey may be required. This
survey was conducted in accordance with the Minimum Survey Standards as
outlined by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division.

APPENDIX V
ARTIFACT ANALYIS BY WILLIAM A. DICKENS
The prehistoric artifact assemblage recovered from 41DW284 during the
survey of the DCP Midstream CGP 81 to CGP 82 Pipeline project consists of 1
projectile point, 4 bifaces, 1 scraper, and 281 pieces of debitage. Included within
the debitage count are 17 flakes recovered from the surface. The rest of the
flakes were found in shovel tests. Also recovered in the shovel tests were four
fragmented and weathered pieces of bone.
Projectile Point
The projectile point was found on the surface during the Pedestrian
Survey phase of the project (Figure 1). It shows many affinities of the Ensor
type. Due to the fact that it has been extensively re-worked, itâs exact typing is
subjective at best. Most likely, it is an Ensor. If so, this places its age as
Transitional Archaic that spans the period from 200 B.C. to A.D. 600 (Turner and
Hester 1993:114).
This point is complete and measures 21.2 mm in length, 19.0 mm in width,
and 5.8 mm in thickness. Its shoulder width is 16.5 mm and has a juncture width
(the point of haft attachment) of 15.0 mm. The stem is expanding, and the haft
element is side-notched. Some stem smoothing is present in the haft area. As
mentioned above, the point has been extensively re-worked and, as a result, the
blade has been shortened considerably from its original configuration.

Figure 1. Re-worked Dart Point

Bifaces
Four bifaces were recovered. One was recovered from a shovel test, and
three were found on the surface. They are discussed and illustrated below.
Biface 1: This specimen was recovered from the surface (Figure 2.) This
is a late stage biface that is represented only by the proximal portion. It is made
of light brown chert and is well flaked. It probably broke during the final thinning
process. It is also possible that it fractured while being used as a knife or other
cutting tool. It measures 45.0 mm long, 34.8 mm wide, and 8.2 mm thick. Its
shape is lanceloate, and the base is straight.

Figure 2. Biface 1.

Biface 2: This specimen was recovered from Level 1 (0-10 cm) of Shovel
Test 6 (Figure 3). It is a late stage biface and is represented only by the proximal
portion. It is made of a very fine-grained chert that has some translucency. This
may have been a finished piece that broke during use, as it is broken in a
number of places. It is flaked on one side in an oblique manner, and the other
side is too damaged to determine the flaking type. It measures 34.8 mm long,
20.0 mm wide, and 4.7 mm thick. Its shape is lanceolate, and it has a straight
base that is also slightly damaged.

Figure 3. Biface 2

Biface 3: This specimen was recovered from the surface (Figure 4). It is
a middle stage biface made of brown chert with only the distal end remaining. It
probably broke during manufacture, as it appears that was never used as a tool.
It is roughly flaked around the edges with a single large flake removed from one
side. It measures 57.1 mm long, 39.3 mm wide, and 10.3 mm thick. The
remaining portion is triangular in shape; however, the finished configuration is
impossible to determine.

Figure 4. Biface 3

Biface 4. This is a very interesting specimen (Figure 5). This late stage
biface was found on the surface. It is complete and is made of brown chert. It
measures 90.4 mm long, 83.1 mm wide, and 10.8 mm thick. It is well flaked with
some slight damage to one lateral edge that is probably the result of plow
damage. It is lanceolate in shape and has a straight base. This specimen was
used as a cutting tool, possibly a knife. It was subjected to use-wear analysis
that consisted of a microscopic scan of 300x and 500x power. It was found to
have heavy rounding and polish along both lateral edges with some striations
present along each edge. This polish is indicative of cutting some abrasive
material such as plants. There is also some residue present near the center of
the distal end of one face along one flake ridge. It is âpurplishâ in color and very
resistant to cleaning and solvents. However, when viewed under 500x power the
residue is very evident. Although it was probably used on plants, the âpurplishâ
color is also reminiscent of blood. In addition, metal marks were noted on the
damaged area mentioned above.

Scraper
This specimen was found on the surface (Figure 6). It is a thick uniface
scraper made on a split cobble or macro-flake of yellowish-brown chert. Some
cortex remains on the proximal end indicating the material type is a water-worn
cobble. It measures 56.0 mm long, 40.8 mm wide, and is 15.8 mm thick. Most of
the flaking is typical of hard-hammer percussion that primarily removed only large
flakes from the dorsal surface. Although it is described as being a uniface, some
minor flaking is present along one ventral edge. This was probably done to
facilitate the dorsal flaking. Edge modifications are present along one distal
lateral edge and the opposite lateral edge on the proximal end. These
modifications are micro-flake scars that were probably conducted with either a
pressure tool or light hard-hammer blows.

Debitage (general discussion)
There are 281 pieces of debitage from this site. Seventeen were collected
from the surface because they contain one or more attributes worthy of further
examination in the laboratory, and they are discussed separately. The raw
material used in all of the debitage recovered is from local gravels. These
gravels vary in size, color, and texture. The latter two aspects became very
evident during the analysis, and several attributes were identified during the
coding phase. These attributes include size, presence or absence of cortex,
platform type, presence or absence of bulbs of percussion, types of bulbs of
percussion, extent of burning, condition of flake, reason for termination, and
presence or absence of a platform lip.
The size of the flakes was determined by passing them through a series of
graduated screens. The screen sizes are 50 mm or more (size grade 1), 37.5
mm to 50 mm (size grade 2), 25 mm to 37.5 mm (size grade 3), 19 mm to 25 mm
(size grade 4), 12.5 mm to 19 mm (size grade 5), 9.5 mm to 12.5 mm (size grade
6), 6.3 mm to 19 mm (size grade 7), and less than 6.3 mm (size grade 8). An
individual listing of the various size grades from each shovel test is provided in
Table 1. The sizes collected varied between size grades 4 and 8. No large
flakes were saved from the shovel tests. The number of flakes between size
grades 5 and 6 were almost equal in most of the shovel tests. Flakes that are
size grade 6 and 7 were slightly more numerous. The flakes from shovel tests 5
and 6 are size grades 6-8, and they tended to be smaller than those in the other
tests.
The flakes were examined for their condition, and it was determined that
many were broken. Distal fragments were the most common (n=85), and they
were followed by proximal fragments (n=32), and medial fragments (n=45) in
terms of numbers of specimens. Complete flakes numbered 64. A complete list
of flakes according to their condition is provided in Table 2. The flakes collected
at this site were identified as primary (100% cortex present), secondary (up to
90% cortex present), and interior flakes (no cortex present). A complete list of
the number of flakes with cortex by shovel test is presented in Table 3. Flakes
with no cortex (n=129) were the most common type found in the shovel tests.
Those with partial cortex were second with 78 specimens, and flakes with 100%
coverage were last with 49 specimens. Interior flakes (no cortex) were the most
common type found in shovel tests 5 (n=28) and 6 (n=68), the area where the
quarry camp was probably located.

There was a slight variation in the type of platforms present. Unfortunately,
many of the flakes were not complete, and their platforms were missing or
crushed. Crushing was very common on the flakes from shovel tests 4-6. The
most common type of platform is the plain type, or one that has only had the
surface cortex removed and no further preparation performed. A few natural
(unaltered) dihedral (two micro-flake scars) and faceted (more than two microflake scars) platform types were noted. These platform types are indications of
more purposeful flake removals. A complete list of platform types is provided in
Table 4.

The bulbs of percussion on the flakes from this site were identified as
diffuse (no bulb), strong bulbs, and slight bulbs. Flakes with these bulbs were
almost equal throughout all of the shovel tests. There are slightly more diffuse
ventral surfaces in shovel tests 4-6. Unfortunately, bulb types for the majority of
flakes (especially shovel tests 4, 6, and 7) could not be determined. A complete
list of bulb types for each shovel test is provided in Table 5. The amount of
burning present showed that the majority of flakes had been subjected to
temperatures of varying degrees. Most exhibited potlids and crazing or had
reddish color on various parts of the flake that is an indication of slight heating.
The majority of flakes (n=128) did not have any evidence of being exposed to
heat, and the distribution of these flakes is Shovel Test 2 (n=7), Shovel Test 3
(n=5), Shovel Test 4 (n=28), Shovel Test 5 (n=31), and Shovel Test 6 (n=57).
Evidence of burning is exhibited by flakes that are colored on one side (usually a
reddish cooler), glossy and slick on the other side, or glossy and slick on both
sides. A complete list of the number and type of heated and unheated flakes is
provided in Table 6.
The presence or absence of a platform lip (slight ridge directly under the
platform) is usually considered as an indication of flake removal from a hard
hammer or soft hammer billet. Generally, lips are more abundant on diffuse
ventral surfaces than those with bulbs of percussion. However, the majority of
flakes, whether with bulbs or diffuse, have no platform lips. This was basically
true for the flakes from all of the shovel tests with the majority noted in shovel
tests 4-6. A complete list of those with lips from all of the shovel tests is
provided in Table 7.
The reason for termination of the flakes include feathering, hinge
fractures, step fractures, or unknown. The most common type is feathering (a
type of termination that ends in a thin gradual edge). Hinge fractures result in a
rounded edge, and step fractures result in an abrupt edge. The latter are often
difficult to differentiate from termination as a result of breakage. Even though this
is usually recognizable by someone with experience in flint knapping, it is
subjective at best. Usually, thicker flakes are easier to recognize as exhibiting
step fractures. The various types of termination observed in the sample from the
shovel tests are depicted in Table 8.

Debitage (surface collection)
A sample of flakes was collected from the surface in order to provide a
better understanding of the type and variations of chert present. Most of these
flakes were large primary flakes. Since the crew did not save primary flakes from
the shovel tests, these are the only specimens available for analysis. All of these
flakes were made from local gravels except for one piece that was made from
quartzite. The quartzite specimen is a split cobble and was probably used as a
hammerstone that broke during initial testing and/or reduction. Quartzite is a
very popular material that was preferred for such activities, and it is often found in
gravel deposits that contain chert gravels.
All of the sizes in this sample are either size grade 3 or 4, with two in size
grade 5. Three of the 17 flakes are proximal fragments, 2 are distal flakes, and
the remainder is complete flakes. Of the 17 flakes, 6 are interior types, and the
rest are secondary types. All of the platforms are plain except for one that is
crushed. Bulbs are present on all but one, and burning is present on only two
flakes. Only those having no evidence of burning were selected. Many of the
flakes on the surface exhibited varying degrees of burning; therefore, there was
some bias in those selected. No lips were noted on any of these flakes, and the
reason for termination was mainly due to feathering. Six exhibited step fractures,
and the reason for termination is not known for two of the flakes.
All of the flakes found on the surface are typical of generalized quarry
testing and initial flaking. This statement is supported by the abundance of large,
primary (thick) flakes and secondary flakes with strong bulbs of percussion. All
of these specimens were collected from the surface at the top of a ridge in an
area that had been disturbed by construction for an existing pipeline. Flakes and
cobbles in this area were very abundant and observed for a considerable
distance along the pipeline easement. A few cobbles were collected in order to
sample the types and variation of gravels present. Most of those selected were
no larger than a âsoftball,â but larger specimens were noted. Many had been
tested by the removal of one or two flakes, a good indication of typical quarry
use. All of the cobbles are stream worn, and they are probably Uvalde gravels
(Banks 1990:56-57). The cobbles were abundant on the top of the ridge. Since
they increased in number on the slopes (especially to the east), this may be the
result of erosion.

Discussion
Site 41DW284 is a quarry site that consists of a deposit of Uvalde gravels.
Since this gravel type was first described (Byrd 1971:110), there has been
controversy concerning Uvalde gravels as a valid type. The problem surrounds
the idea that all upland gravel deposits in Central Texas and South Texas are
Uvalde gravels (Hill 1891:368). Byrd (1971) assigned at least eight different
names to these gravels, but other scholars did not generally accept them. Since
that time, many researchers have concluded that many of these gravels occur on
landforms composed of deposits of different ages, and that the gravels on these
deposits cannot be related (Nordt 1983). Uvalde gravels are generally
considered to occur south of San Antonio, but their exact range has not been
well documented. Thus, it is probable that the gravels at site 41DW284 are
probably Uvalde gravels since they occur in a similar zone as those south of San
Antonio. Based on an archaeological project at the site of the proposed Cuero 1
Reservoir, Fox et al. (1974:200), states that upland gravels were the main lithic
source for the region. Unfortunately, no specific name has been assigned to
these gravels. The gravels at 41DW284 are present on top of the ridge and on
the east and west slopes. The gravels on the slopes are more exposed than
those on top of the ridge, and it is believed that this is due to erosion. The
majority of tested cobbles and flakes were noted on the ridge top, but this may be
due to the fact that the existing pipeline had disturbed the surface.
The debitage (especially that on the surface) is typical of what would be
found associated with a quarry. Usually, quarries are areas where raw materials
were collected and taken to a âquarry campâ where they were reduced in size to
make them easier to transport before taking them to a base camp where they
were made into formal tools (Holmes 1897, 1919; Dickens and Dockall 1993:6465; Shafer 1993:49-50). Dickens (1993) created a linear reduction model that
illustrates the various activities associated with procurement, quarry camps, and
base camps (Figure 7). Usually the quarry camp is located in the immediate
area but not at the actual quarry site. Reasons for this may be a fear of other
groups that may pose a threat or the lack of a source of water or other needs to
sustain a camp in the area. The majority of flakes were found in shovel tests 4-6
(n=226), the area where the quarry camp is believed to have been located. The
flakes in these three tests account for 85.6% of the total number of flakes found
in the shovel tests. The distribution of flakes by number per shovel test is
depicted in Table 9.

Occasionally, quarry camps were located directly next to the primary
quarry, and this appears to be the case for site 41DW284. The debitage analysis
found that many of the smaller pieces had been pressure flaked, and many of the
platforms exhibited more careful flake removals. Such flakes are not typical of
those removed during the early stage of reduction. A tributary of Sandies Creek
is 76 meters from the eastern edge of the site near shovel tests 4-6. These are
the tests where the small flakes were found. Therefore, it is likely that a camp
was in this area. In addition to the small flakes, some of the bifaces were thinned
beyond the early stage. A possible explanation is that normal activities
associated with survival (i.e., food preparation) were carried out. Their presence
at this site contributed to the overall use of the site regardless if they were
created at the site or brought to the area from another location.
Conclusions
It is concluded that site 41DW284 is a quarry where cobbles were tested
for their potential for making stone tools. In addition, there is evidence that
suggests a camp was located on the east slope of the site next to the quarry.
The number of artifacts collected and flakes observed on the surface and in the
shovel tests indicate that the area was used for a considerable period of time.
