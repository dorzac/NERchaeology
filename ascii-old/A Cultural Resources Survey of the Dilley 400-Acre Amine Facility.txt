Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations to conduct a field survey of the 400-acre Dilley Amine
Facility in northwestern LaSalle County, to be developed by Mockingbird Midstream Gas
Services, L.L.C. (Mockingbird). The project was entirely privately funded, and the property is
privately owned; therefore, no Texas Antiquities Permit was required. No artifacts were collected
during this survey.
A 100-percent pedestrian survey with systematic shovel testing within the 400 acres was
conducted by four archaeologists on 6 and 7 February, 2011, resulting in the discovery of three
prehistoric archaeological sites and one historic archaeological site, along with four prehistoric
isolated finds, and a single isolated historic find. Site 41LS149 is a prehistoric open campsite
assessed as being a heavily disturbed, generally surficial lithic scatter of little significance.
Site 41LS150 is another prehistoric open campsite that contained areas of heavily eroded surficial
artifact scatters, but with one discrete area where cultural material is deeply buried and well
stratified. In this case, Tierras Antiguas recommended that the potentially significant portion of
41LS150 be avoided, and Chesapeake Midstream subsequently agreed to avoid the significant
portion of the site by placing a chain link fence around it and designating it as ‘off limits’ for
construction. Site 41LS151 is a heavily eroded, surficial lithic procurement site, and is considered
to be non-significant.
The only historic site discovered (41LS152) lies along the southern boundary of the 400-acre
facility, and extends outside of the proposed development. The portion of 41LS152 that lies
within the 400-acre Amine Facility is considered of little significance, and Tierras Antiguas
recommended that development of the Amine Facility would have no negative impact on this
portion of the site. Finally, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that if any additional,
undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during development, such finds should be
examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.

Introduction
Flatrock Engineering and
Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio,
Texas contracted with Tierras Antiguas
Archaeological Investigations to conduct
a cultural resources background review
and field survey of the 400-acre Dilley
Amine Facility in northwestern La Salle
County, to be developed by
Mockingbird Midstream, and
hereinafter referred to as the Project
Area (PA) (Figures 1-3). Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations
(TAAI) conducted the pedestrian survey,
and excavated 169 shovel tests on
February 6 and 7, 2011.

Modern Environmental Setting Figure 1. Location of La Salle County and the
Project Area in Texas.

Climate and Vegetation
La Salle county is located
in south-central Texas
near its southern border
with Mexico (see Figure
1). Its current political
boundary encompasses
1,517 square miles. The
generally flat to rolling
terrain ranges in
elevation from about
600-800 feet above mean
sea level. Clayey and
loamy soils support the
growth of small,
predominately mesquite
trees, and thorny scrub Figure 2. Dilley Amine Facility on large topographic map.
brush, with assorted cacti and grassy understory.
With its semi-arid environment, the county is generally frost-free from mid-February through
early December, allowing for a 288-day growing season. The average annual rainfall is about 22
1

inches, with most rainfall
occurring in May and September.
These peaks are the result of
thunderstorms bearing moist air
from the Gulf of Mexico to the
east, and the Pacific Ocean much
farther to the west. La Salle
County is known as part of the
Winter Garden Region for the
vegetables grown there (Leffler
1996; Gabriel et al. 1985).
However, rainfall amounts vary
significantly from year to year,
and the high evapotranspiration
effects in the area effectively
offset any beneficial surplus of
annual rainfall. This is another
reason irrigation systems are so Figure 3. Dilley Amine Facility shown on Woodward (1974)
necessary, and commonly found USGS 7.5' topographic map.
in use today throughout the area.
Summers are indeed hot and dry, with temperatures consistently hovering above 1000F, although
humidity is generally low compared to environments closer to the Gulf Coast. Overall, the
county’s climate can be classified as subtropical steppe.
Hydrology
The Nueces River and the Rio Grande are the major southeasterly trending rivers draining the
South Texas region. A subtle divide through the northeastern portion of the county causes
numerous intermittent creeks to flow north into the Nueces River, and numerous others of the
same type to drain southward into the Rio Grande. Many drainages intermittently flow into both
rivers during infrequent seasonal periods of abundant rainfall. Although there are many springs
in La Salle County, very few are active due primarily to the dip of the substrate shales which carry
these subterranean seeps to the south and east. As a result, some of these active seeps/springs can
be found on the Mexican side of the national border. Ancient springs that may have existed in the
area at one time have likely succumbed to overgrazing and irrigation pumping during modern
times (Brune 1981).

Flora and Fauna
The project area lies within the South Texas Plain/Brush Country vegetation area as defined by
Gould (1975), and the regional flora of South Texas has been classified as being part of the
Tamaulipan biotic province extending out from northeast Mexico (Figures 4 and 5). This is the
only part of Texas where some vegetation exhibits growth throughout the year (Blair 1950; Map

2

2011a). Thorny brush is the dominant
vegetation today, but this is a relatively
recent occurrence, with a mix of woody
and grassland species providing a
savanna environment during prehistoric
times (Archer 1995; Black 1989; Hester
1980; Inglis 1964). The original
vegetation was an open grassland mixed
with brushy chaparral. Oaks, pecan, and
ash were common along perennial
streams. Due in part to overgrazing and
the exclusion of fire, the invasion of
woody species has changed the
vegetation into “Texas brush country”
dominated by mesquite, acacia, spiny
hackberry, brazil, whitebrush, lotebrush,
and others (Diamond et al. 1987:203221). On sandy soils, the brush includes
mesquite with mixed grasses. In contrast,
clay soils support mesquite (Proposis
juliflora), various species of Acacia, and
mimosa, granjeno or desert hackberry
(Celtis pallida), lignum vitae (Porliera Figure 4. Physiographic regions of Texas
angustifolia), cenizo (Leucophyllum http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/pics/txphysio.jpg)
texanum), white brush (Aloysia texana),
prickly pear (Opuntia lindheeimeri),
tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis), and
species of Condalia and Castela (Blair
1950).
The South Texas Plains/Brush Country
exhibits some of the greatest mammalian
species diversity in the state. Sixty-one
species of mammals, 36 snakes, 19
lizards, and several species of turtles,
salamanders, and frogs are present in the
region (Blair 1950). Approximately 50
species of fish have been identified in
the lower Rio Grande (Lee et al. 1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of south Texas is as varied as the landscape, and the South Texas
Paleoclimatic record contains significant gaps primarily due to the scarcity of deep, finely
stratified, and well-dated deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995:51). To date, the best record of
paleoenvironmental reconstruction in South Texas has been accomplished by Robinson (1982)
from analysis of phytoliths from three archaeological sites in Live Oak County. Overall, the data
there along with data from other sites in Texas suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or lateglacial period, marked a transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew
warmer and drier, and more seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years
ago.
Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago was
much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area
that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The greater changes have been induced by
human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along the river and streams for
construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps, springs, and streams in the area,
they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter intervals than exist at the present
time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Chronology
The project area lies within the South Texas Archaeological region as defined by Hester (1980,
1995, 2004; Figure 6). Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is problematic, due to the
compressed nature of the archaeological record and the scarcity of stratified sites excavated within
the region. The largest and most informational cultural resources survey in South Texas was that
conducted prior to development of the Choke Canyon Reservoir in Atascosa, Live Oak, and
McMullen counties (e.g. Hall et al. 1986). Nevertheless, Hester (1995:433) acknowledges the
paucity of information that exists for south Texas and as such offers only a “general framework”
for prehistoric periods particular to the region (Figure 5). All dates are given as approximate years
before present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.

Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1999). The

4

Paleoindian period began toward
the close of the Pleistocene.
Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include
Clovis and Folsom projectile
points. The wide distribution of
Clovis-type points across most
of North America and even into
Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the
people who made them. Other
artifacts associated with the
Clovis culture include bifaces
and prismatic blades, engraved
stones, bone and ivory points,
stone bolas, ochre, and shaft
straighteners. During the late
Paleoindian interval, the first
stemmed lanceolate points, such
as Angostura, Golondrina, St.
Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among
a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian
adaptation has been considered
to be one of small bands of
nomadic, big-game hunters
following herds of Late
Pleistocene fauna, including
mammoth, mastodons, bison,
camel, and horse, across North
America (Black 1989). More
recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of
plants and animals used for
subsistence by these early
Americans, such as turtles and
tortoises, alligators, mice,
badgers, and raccoons, although
they undoubtedly hunted the
large animals as well (Collins
1995:381). Known Clovis sites
include killsites, quarries, Figure 6. South Texas Archaeological region cultural
caches, open campsites, ritual chronology.
5

sites, and burials (Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts
are fairly common in south Texas; however, no camp sites or killsites have been found south of
a large workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar County (Hester 1995:434–435). Most
Paleoindian finds in south Texas have consisted of surface lithic scatters on upland terraces and
ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters
were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes
in the subsistence base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural
period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of south Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic huntergatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was
necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources such as deer, fish,
and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked rock
cooking features, and more specialized tools. Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups
were small and highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly
distributed and that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including most
of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low during
the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with “few
constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization of a
wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as
well as rodents, rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population,
based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). On the
South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear
continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. Weir (1976)
believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at
least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of
gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned
rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). The common
presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer processing took
place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
6

Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a movement toward less
mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas
Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between ca. 2550 and 2750
B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P, Some
researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while
others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30). Subsistence
is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence
base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries indicates that Late
Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial.
Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make
pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “pre-ceramic” until 1,000 years
later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic
points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner and Hester (1993) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period during
the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is represented by
diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap the Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this marked a transition
period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and bison, and a
reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw 1985; Peter
1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not disappear and sites
were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted.
Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).

7

Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a nonstandard
manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the ones that best
suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core reduction and the
manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology is a continent-wide
phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally
sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live
near each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans were
8

rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then,
is generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

La Salle County Prehistory and History
Indian artifacts found in La Salle County indicate that the area has been occupied for about 11,000
years. Plentiful food sources such as wild game, fruits, seeds, and roots made the land hospitable.
Early technology included tools from wood and stone, woven basketry, sewed rabbitskin robes,
and a very effective weapon was the atlatl, a throwing stick that greatly increased the deadliness
of their spears (Leffler 1996). Perhaps as early as 1,300 years ago, they learned to make pottery
and to hunt with bows and arrows. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the
Coahuiltecan Indians native to La Salle County were squeezed out by other Indian who were
migrating into the area and by the Spanish, who were moving up from the south. Many of the
Coahuiltecans were taken to San Juan Bautista in Coahuila. Apaches and Comanches moved in
to take their place (Leffler 1996).
“No permanent Spanish settlement seems to have been established in [La Salle County].
Beginning in the late 1600s, however, Spaniards passed through the area on the Old San Antonio
Road, a camino real, to and from other Spanish settlements in Texas. After the Mexican War of
Independence the Mexican government used land grants to encourage its citizens to settle in
Texas. Perhaps as many as seven grants were made between 1832 and 1834 that included territory
now in La Salle County. None of the recipients seems to have made use of the land, however. By
1836, when Texas became independent from Mexico, the area remained populated almost solely
by Indians (Leffler 1996).
Between the Texas Revolution and the Mexican War (1836–46), most of La Salle County lay in
the disputed area between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River, and it became a haven for
9

desperate characters until about 1865. New settlers who lived in jacals or dugouts were frequently
being harrassed by hostile Indians and outlaws. Due in part tobeing pursued by the Texas Rangers,
and being decimated by disease, the Indians were forced to leave La Salle County by 1877. By
1880, cattle ranching was firmly established, and although sheep ranching was also an important
part of the economy at the time, by 1900 extended droughts and an increase in predators combined
to make sheep ranching a tough and dwindling business (Leffler 1996).
As with the rest of the nation, during the Great Depression many of the county’s farmers were
forced to cut back their once-lucrative vegetable production during the depression, and fell back
on raising poultry, hogs, and dairy cattle (Leffler 1996). The discovery of large oil and gas fields
in the county in the 1950s certainly bolstered La Salle County’s economy, and although large
ranches lay claim to most of the land in the county, the production of oil and gas are very much
a progressively increasing part of the county’s development (Leffler 1996).

Results of A Cultural Resources Background Review
The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the immediate
area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the PA
3) A search of various websites that offer old maps of the PA
4) A literature review of both published and unpublished reports and manuscripts that describe
the types of archaeological sites that have been documented, and thus provide insight as to the
types of sites that may be expected either in the PA, or immediately adjacent to it
5) A review of a local soils map in order to evaluate the potential for intact and buried cultural
materials either within or immediately adjacent to the PA.

Site Types to be Expected within the 400-Acre Dilley Amine Facility
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in La Salle County are prehistoric open campsites
ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period (see Figure 5). Some of
these represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have
camped for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large
10

groups of people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning
to these same campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found
at these large campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks
representing multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that
results from making them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal
remains from terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and
snail shells. Open campsites occur in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine
environment that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands
away from flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, cacti offered a different
food source that could be exploited such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads
and tunas, and agave hearts. In addition, at various times, bison were known to graze on the
northern South Texas Plains, and were highly sought after for use as food, hides, and bone tools
(Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that can be expectedwithin
the 400-acre Dilley Amine Facility. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and
broken tools that were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their
old ones. The general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found
at open campsites suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period
of time ( However, small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles
to make them more knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the
natural outcroppings or surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite
cobbles. Examples of chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one
or two flakes removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from
experience the quality of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool
production, so they ‘tested’ the cobble to judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality was
judged to be inferior, then the cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles
found on these sites are of poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool
products are carried away from these sites, what remains are those tools broken during the
manufacturing process, and the thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and angular
debris. Also unique to lithic scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’.
These are simply cobbles flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’
11

that can be used to further reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it.
The unbroken quarry blanks are usually not found on these sites because they have been carried
off, presumably to areas of south Texas where raw material is not readily available. The snapped
or broken quarry blanks are of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found
on any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops
that were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried
today, and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and the dynamics
of landscape evolution through time. Most lithic scatters in the La Salle County area have been
documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries and Procurement Sites
Prehistoric quarries and procurement also can range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic
periods, but differ from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose
gravels, but at times they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or
quartzites were not yet freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’.
These types of sites are rare in south Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally
do not present themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to
pick up gravels from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped
stone remains likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites,
as well as parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be
expected. Although a handful of prehistoric quarries or procurement sites have been recorded in
south Texas, they are rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
The documentation of burned rock middens is rare in La Salle County. Burned rock middens
result from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much like modern-day
roasting pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the larger rocks that
serve as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective as a thermal
source, they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable, another is
dug near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched out’ firecracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as almost indiscernible unless excavated (For
a full discussion of the formation of burned rock middens and their documented presence in
Texas, see Leach and Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in south
Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites in both
upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams, but the largest prehistoric cemetery
found is 41LK28, in Live Oak County (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Historic Sites
As discussed above in the Cultural Chronology portion of this report, although Spanish ranchers
12

had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th century, and Spanish entradas
began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no record of any sort of permanent
structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992), the area was generally not considered
safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil War in 1865, and white settlers then began
establishing smaller ranches and farmlands (Leffler and Long 2010; Leffler 2010).
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of
south Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types
most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation
remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial
or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects.
Archaeological Atlas Site Results
There are only 99 archaeological sites recorded within La Salle County, ranging in age from the
Paleoindian through the Historic periods. Of the 99 sites, 54 are prehistoric open campsites, and
45 are prehistoric lithic scatters. Historic components on these same prehistoric sites include
historic windmills and areas scattered glass and ceramic sherds, or in some cases there are large
trash dumps. One unique historic site is Fort Ewell (41LS19), an adobe structure located on the
old Laredo to San Antonio Road, and that served the U.S. Army from 1852-1854. The only State
Archaeological Landmark (SAL) recorded in La Salle County is the County Courthouse in
Cotulla. A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archaeological sites
(Atlas 2011) indicated that there were no documented cultural resources surveys or archaeological
sites within one mile of the Dilley Amine Facility.

Historic Maps and Aerial Photographs
Ms. Judy Vader conducted a research for historic aerial photographs of the PA. Her review
indicated that in general, the area had apparently been historically used as ranch land pasture. The
earliest aerial photographs discovered were taken in 1952, 1959, and then in 1973 (Figures 7-9),
with little development detected.
However, a structure is shown on a 1974, 7.5' Woodward USGS topographic map, and located
just a few meters south of the PA (see Figure 3). Further research indicated that the structure did
not appear on the next earliest available topographic map, produced in 1942 (Map 2011). Thus,
the structure and any related outbuildings were apparently constructed sometime between 1942
and 1974. As such, portions of the locale could then possibly be considered an historic
archaeological site. In sum, the historical research indicated a distinct possibility that historic
artifacts and/or structures could be encountered while surveying the southern portion of the PA.

Soils Maps
A review of county soils maps and
publications both online and in hard copy
format indicated that the Dilley Amine Facility
was to be developed on five different soil
classifications that offered varying depths,
sedimentation, and deposition rates. As such,
they likewise implied the potential for the
preservation of intact cultural resources to
exist. However, it should be noted that soils
maps are simply one indicator of the potential
for buried and intact archaeological deposits to
exist, are merely one component, and should
be considered within that perspective. Figure
10 shows these soil areas, and Table 1 lists the
soils that are to be impacted by development
of the Amine Facility (Gabriel et al. 1994;
Web Soil Survey 2011).
Figure 9. 1973 aerial photo of the PA.

Figure 10. Soils map.
Approximately 80 percent of the PA is covered with deep Duval loamy fine sand (DsC) that
commonly occurs on gently sloping foot slopes of hills and ridges in La Salle County. Duval fine
sandy loam (DvB) covers about 12 percent of the PA. These deep, loamy soils are found over
sandstone bedrock on broad, smooth plains and the foot slopes of hills and ridges. Perhaps 3
percent of the Facility is covered with Poteet very fine sandy loam (Pt). This loamy soil is very
deep, and is common along narrow drainageways adjacent to the uplands. Dilley fine sandy loam
(DLC) comprises maybe 2 percent of the PA. Dilley fine sandy loam soils are shallow, found on
summit and shoulder slopes of hills and ridges on the plains, and overlie sandstone bedrock. The
remaining less than 1 percent in the extreme southeastern corner of the PA is Tiocano clay (Tc).
Tiocano clay is deep, and forms along depressions and playas on nearly level plains.

Field Survey Goals and Methodology
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South
Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)
locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;
2)
quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,
3)
place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Four archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the entire 400 acres, with
systematic shovel testing in a 100-meter grid, in addition to areas that offered at least a moderate
potential for buried and intact cultural resources to exist. A total of 169 shovel tests were
excavated (Figure 11). Surface visibility ranged from 90 to 100 percent, and rodent and mammal
backdirt piles were thoroughly examined. Shovel tests were dug in 20-cm levels, and all
sediments were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. The results of shovel testing were fully
documented on Shovel Test forms, are on file at the Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations office in Martindale, Texas, and may be made available upon request.
All shovel test locations were documented with a hand-held GPS. In accordance with a general
“no collection” policy, cultural material of a redundant nature, both prehistoric and historic,
observed either on the surface or within shovel tests were not to be collected. Instead, they were
to be fully documented via sketches, field photographs, and copious notes. Following that they
were to be returned to the surface if surface finds, or to the top 10 cm of the shovel tests.

16

Exceptions were diagnostic artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be considered as
significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian
transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and
that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist. In this
case, no artifacts of any type or kind were collected during this project.
Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences within the ROW were to be
documented as archaeological sites. In addition, any potentially historic buildings 45 years or
older that were located adjacent to the compressor facility were to be documented with
photographs and included in this report of investigations.

Results of the Field Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
During the survey it became readily apparent that approximately 80 percent of the project’s
surface area was either disturbed or deflated by natural processes. Sparse to dense vegetation
throughout much of the 400 acres consisted of small mesquite trees, shrubs, mesquite brush, and
native grasses. In addition, the northern quarter has been cleared and cultivated, and numerous
two-track, cleared roads crisscross the PA.
Archaeological Sites and Isolated Finds Discovered
Four previously undocumented prehistoric archaeological sites were found withing the 400-acre
Dilley Amine Facility boundary (Figure 12). Sites 41LS149 and 41LS150 are prehistoric open
campsites, with unknown periods of occupation. Site 41LS151 is a prehistoric lithic procurement
site and scatter, also of an unknown age. Site 41LS152 is a historic site with outbuildings,
fencing, and a well related to mid-20th century farming and ranching. In addition, one historic,
and four prehistoric isolated finds were discovered within the 400-acre PA. They consist of a
projectile point, and flakes. Each is described in the following section.

41LS149
Description
41LS149 (Figures 13 and 14) is a
prehistoric open campsite of an
unknown age, consisting of a surface
scatter of fire-cracked rocks, stone tools,
lithic debitage, mussel shells, and snails.
It is situated on a heavily eroded upland
sideslope, ranging in elevation from
570-590 feet above mean sea level
(amsl). Surface visibility in February
2011 was excellent amidst sparse
grasses and assorted cacti.
Figure 13. 41LS149; facing north.
Soils on the site consist of
Duval loamy fine sand
(Ds C ), shallow soi l s
commonly found on 0-5
percent slopes in the uplands
of La Salle County (Gabriel
et al. 1994).

Levels of Effort and Results
An inspection of the surface,
along with shovel test results
suggests that the site is
spread across approximately
100,00 square meters (400
meters [n-s] x 250 meters [ew]).
Artifacts discovered on the
surface included fire-cracked
ro ck s , n o n - d i a gnos t i c
bifaces, core fragments,
flakes, and a hammerstone
(see Figure 15). Mussel and
snail shells suggest that
mussels and snails were
likely one ingredient of the
foodstuffs eaten at the site.
Figure 14. 41LS149 site map.

19

Fine-grained cherts made
up approximately 95
percent of the material,
with the remaining
approximately 5 percent
consisting of fine and
coarse-grained quartzites.
Bifaces were observed
that exhibited both
middle and late stages of
reduction. Flake
classifications included
exterior core reduction,
interior, and bifacial
thinning, suggesting a
continuum of lithic
reduction acti vities
occurred at the site. The Figure 15. Examples of artifacts on the surface of 41LS149: (a)

cracked rocks on the
surface were predominantly chert. The only artifact discovered in the multiple shovel tests dug
on and around the site was a chert bifacial manufacturing flake from Shovel Test K-6 (see Figure
13), between 20-40 centimeters below the surface (cmbs). Shovel Test K-6 was located in a
heavily eroded area of the site, and the sediments in that area are in secondary context.
Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
41LS149 appears to be a large open campsite on a heavily eroded slope. Evidence of stone tool
manufacturing was evident, from core reduction through final stage bifaces, and multiple hearth
features are probable. However, in February 2011, we estimate that less than 2 percent of the site
remains intact. As such, its research value is considered minimal, with no potential for deeply
buried and well-stratified archaeological deposits to exist. As such, Tierras Antiguas assesses the
site as non-significant.

41LS150
Description
41LS150 (Figure 16) is a prehistoric open campsite of an unknown age, consisting of fire-cracked
rocks, stone tools, lithic debitage, mussel shells, and snails on the surface, but also recovered in
stratified contexts below the surface in a discrete portion of the site. The site is situated
predominantly on an upland sideslope, and eroding into shallow and ephemeral terraces of the
upper reaches of Sage Creek. It is now covered with small mesquite trees, assorted cacti, and
sparse grasses. The site’s locale is near an apex between the upper reaches of Sage Creek, and
the upper reaches of Cibolo Creek, and at a divide between the Frio and Nueces rivers basins that
divide La Salle County.

The surface ranges in elevation
from in elevation from 540-575
feet above mean sea level (amsl),
and surface visibility in February
2011 was excellent amidst
secondary mesquite, sparse
grasses and assorted cacti. Soils
on the site consist of three types:
(1) Duval loamy fine sand (DsC),
shallow soils commonly found on
0-5 percent slopes in the uplands
of La Salle County; (2) Duval
fine sandy loam (DvB), deep
loamy soils on convex uplands;

The western portion of the site is
heavily disturbed, and artifacts
along the extreme western slope
and gullies have been washed
downslope from the main, upper
portion of the site (see Figures
16 and 17). However the upper,
portion of the site exhibits
relatively deep and stable soils
with sparse mesquite and
assorted cacti (Figure 18).

along with shovel test results
suggests that the site is spread across approximately 137,500 square meters (500 meters [n-s] x
275 meters [e-w]). Artifacts discovered on the surface included fire-cracked rocks, non-diagnostic
bifaces, core fragments, and flakes. Mussel and snail shells suggest that mussels and snails were
likely one ingredient of the foodstuffs eaten at the site.
Fine-grained cherts made up approximately 95 percent of the material, with the remaining
approximately 5 percent consisting of fine and coarse-grained quartzites. Bifaces were observed
that exhibited both middle and late stages of reduction. Flake classifications included exterior core
reduction, interior, and bifacial thinning, suggesting a continuum of lithic reduction activities
occurred at the site. The scattered burned and fire-cracked rocks on the surface were both chert
and sandstone. Cultural material was prevalent in all animal backdirt piles on the upper portion
of the site. Artifacts were recovered from apparent stratified sediments in four shovel tests (STs);
the results are shown in Table 2.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
41LS150 appears to be a large open campsite situated on a low east-west ridge, and above a
possibly prehistoric water source and exposed gravels in Sage Creek to the northwest. Firecracked rocks from multiple hearths are present, as is evidence of stone tool manufacturing, from
core reduction through final stage bifaces.
Numerous artifacts have washed downslope to the northwest, and are now in secondary contexts.
However, the upper portion exhibits stratifies sediments, soils, and cultural material. Although
the research value is considered minimal on most of the site, and no adverse impact will occur
with the development of the Amine Facility, we assess the upper portion of the site as potentially
significant, and recommended avoidance and protection of that area. Accordingly, Tierras
Antiguas subsequently met with Chesapeake Midstream-contracted surveyors on the site, and the
area recommended for avoidance and protection (in addition to a 10-meter buffer zone) was shot
in with sub-meter surveying equipment. Chesapeake Midstream has agreed to construct a chain
link fence around the potentially significant portion of the site as shown in Figure 16.

41LS151
Description
41LS151 (Figures 19 and 20) is a
lithic procurement site of an
unknown age, consisting of a
surface scatter of chert flakes and
angular debris. It is situated on a
heavily eroded upland sideslope,
ranging in elevation from 570585 feet above mean sea level
(amsl). Surface visibility in
February 2011 was excellent
amidst sparse grasses and
assorted cacti. Soils on the site
consist of Duval loamy fine sand

locale is near an apex between
the upper reaches of Sage Creek, and the upper reaches of Cibolo Creek, and at a divide between
the Frio and Nueces rivers basins that divide La Salle County.
23

Levels of Effort and Results
No cultural material was found in
any of the shovel tests placed on
and around the site. The surface
distribution of artifacts cover an
area roughly 31,250 square
meters (250 meters [n-s] x 125
meters [e-w]). Artifacts observed
on the surface included small
cores, core fragments, primary
and secondary chert flakes
(Figure 20), amidst a moderate,
dispersed density of fine-grained
chert gravels (some with coarsegrained inclusions) spread across
the slope.
Summary, Conclusions, and
Recommendations
41LS151 appears to be a lithic
procurement site where chert
gravels were exposed on a
heavily eroded slope.
Technologically, the
predominance of cores, core
fragments, and exterior flakes
suggest this site was exploited
for its chert gravels, and initial to
middle stage bifaces were
manufactured. We assess the site
as being able to contribute to the
prehistory of Texas only for its
location on the landscape as a
procurement site. However, no
diagnostics were observed, and is
heavily disturbed and deflated.
As such, its research value is
considered minimal, and Tierras
Antiguas assesses the site as nonsignificant.

in proximity to the house and wellhead.
Otherwise, secondary growth mesquites
have taken over once cleared ranch
pasture. Surface visibility in February
2011 was excellent amidst sparse grasses
and assorted cacti. Soils on the site
consist of Duval loamy fine sand (DsC),
shallow soils commonly found on 0-5
percent slopes in the uplands of La Salle
County (Gabriel et al. 1994). The site’s
locale is near an apex between the upper
reaches of Sage Creek, and the upper
reaches of Cibolo Creek, and at a divide
between the Frio and Nueces rivers
basins that divide La Salle County.
Levels of Effort and Results
A systematic pedestrian surface survey
was conducted in conjunction with a
gridded shovel testing pattern. No
subsurface cultural material was
discovered, however remains of the
farmstead/ranching operation are spread
across an estimated 36,166 square
meters (8.9 acres). The house is located Figure 23. House chimney and wooden pier remains;

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
41LS152 is an historic farmstead where both farming and ranching activities occurred. Glass,
bricks, and appliances suggest an occupation no earlier than about 1950, through perhaps the
1970s. Notably, the house site does not appear on a1942 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Map.
There is no evidence that the house was burned, and the lumber was likely removed for use
elsewhere. Although interesting for its location on the landscape and the history of 20th century
farming and ranching, its cultural resources research value is considered minimal, and Tierras
Antiguas assesses the site as non-significant.

Isolated Finds (IFs)

Isolated Find 1
Isolated Find 1 is a core reduction flake found
on heavily eroded clay hardpan in the western
portion of the PA (see Figure 12). It is made
from fine-grained, grayish brown, non-heat
treated chert (Figure 28).

Figure 28. Isolated Find 1.
Isolated Finds 2 and 3
Isolated Finds 2 and 3 consist of a crude
unifacial chert sidescraper, and a core
reduction flake. Both were found on heavily
eroded clay hardpan in the western portion of
the PA (see Figure 12). Raw material in both
specimens is fine-grained, non-heat treated
gray chert. The core reduction flake exhibits a
moderate amount of patina, while the
sidescraper is heavily patinated (Figure 29).
Figure 29. Isolated Finds 2 and 3: core
reduction flake and sidescraper.
Isolated Find 4
Isolated Find 4 is a broken dart point found on
heavily an eroded clay hardpan, two-track
surface in the northwestern portion of the PA
(see Figure 12). It is made from gray, finegrained chert, and appears to have been
subjected to heat treatment. As shown in
Figure 30, its surface is heavily patinated. Its
distal tip has been broken post-depositionally.
Although it may appear so in Figure 28, both Figure 30. Isolated Find 4: Darl-like dart point.
ears are in their original shape, and have not
been damaged. Its flaking pattern and overall morphology suggest this specimen is a variant of
Darl (or possibly Edgewood), a Transitional Archaic dart point, manufactured circa 1,000-1,250
years (Collins 1995; Hester 1995; Turner and Hester 1999).

27

Isolated Find 5
Isolated Find 5 is an iron-piped wellhead
located in an overgrown field in the
northeastern portion of the PA (see Figure 12).
Sandstone slabs and chunks were scattered
around it; otherwise no historic artifacts were
observed in association. Secondary growth
mesquite trees now closely surround the
wellhead location (Figure 31). Its estimated
period of use is circa 1950s through possibly
1990s.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A full pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing in a systematic grid pattern within the proposed
400-acre Dilley-Amine Facility resulted in the discovery of two prehistoric open campsites, one
prehistoric lithic procurement scatter, and an historic farming/ranching activity with a house site,
well, windmill, and cattle pens. In addition, one historic isolated find, and four prehistoric isolated
finds were documented.
Site 41LS149 is a prehistoric open campsite assessed as being a heavily disturbed, generally
surficial lithic scatters of little significance. Site 41LS150 is another prehistoric open campsite
that contained areas of heavily eroded surficial artifact scatters, but with one discrete area where
cultural material is deeply buried and well stratified. In this case, Tierras Antiguas recommended
that the potentially significant portion of 41LS150 be avoided, and Chesapeake Midstream
subsequently agreed to avoid the significant portion of the site by placing a chain link fence
around it and designating it as ‘off limits’ for construction. Site 41LS151 is a heavily eroded,
surficial lithic procurement site, and is considered to be non-significant.
The only historic site discovered (41LS152) lies along and within the southern boundary of the
400-acre facility, but also extends outside of the proposed development. The portion of 41LS152
that lies within the 400-acre Amine Facility is considered of little significance, and Tierras
Antiguas recommended that development of the Amine Facility would have no negative impact
on this portion of the site.
Finally, Tierras Antiguas further recommends that if any additional, undiscovered cultural
resources are encountered during development, such finds should be examined and evaluated by
Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.
