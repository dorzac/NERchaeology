A Section 106 Cultural Resources Survey of the
3,200-Foot Carowest Riparian Restoration Project,
Comal and Guadalupe Counties, Texas

March 2012

Abstract
Pape-Dawson Engineers of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of 3,200 linear feet of shoreline along Lake
Dunlap on the Guadalupe River in the city of New Braunfels, Comal and Guadalupe counties,
Texas. The project was privately funded, and the property is privately owned. Therefore, no
Texas Antiquities Permit was required. However, Pape-Dawson Engineers is seeking a Clean
Water Act permit through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which required the completion of
a Section 106 cultural resources survey.
The project (known as the Carowest Project) seeks to control erosion along the shore of Lake
Dunlap via restoring the shoreline with natural vegetation and with the addition of fill.
Restoration of the shore will include excavating areas for log placement. Dead trees will be
stacked and then covered with dirt to create a more stable shoreline. Live plantings will be added
to further aid stabilization. Excavation will be limited to 6 feet deep and is not expected to
exceed 15 feet from the shoreline.
Tierras Antiguas conducted a thorough pedestrian survey with auger testing on March 3, 2012,
resulting in the discovery of no prehistoric or historic cultural materials. Therefore, Tierras
Antiguas recommends that the project should be allowed to proceed as currently designed. The
project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered as eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State Archeological
Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should be allowed to proceed without further
archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined and evaluated
by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical
Commission.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.

Introduction and Background
Pape-Dawson Engineers of San
Antonio, Texas is the lead
agency for a riparian restoration
project involving 3,200 linear
feet of shoreline along Lake
Dunlap on the Guadalupe River
in the city of New Braunfels,
Comal and Guadalupe counties,
Texas. At the request of PapeDawson, Tierras Archaeological
Investigations (TAAI)
conducted a cultural resources
survey of the Project Area (PA)
on March 3, 2012.
Repeated flooding and river
erosion in the area of New
Braunfels is a matter of record.
Newspaper and personal
accounts indicate that severe
flooding occurred at least twice Figure 1. Location of the Project Area in Comal and
in the 1860s and '70s, causing Guadalupe counties.
damage to the mills in New
Braunfels (Penshorn
1950:72-73). When Thomas
Taylor measured the fall rate on
the Comal River in 1903, he
noted dams were washed out
and deposited in the river
(Taylor 1904:35).
The existing vertical retaining
walls along the shore of Lake
Dunlap were failing because of
wave erosion from boats, and
erosion during storm events.
The purpose of the project is to
re-establish a stable shoreline
and provide natural habitat. The
project (known as the Carowest
Project) seeks to control
erosion along the shore of Lake

Restoration of the shore will include excavating areas for log placement. Dead trees will be
stacked and then covered with dirt to create a more stable shoreline. Live plantings will be added
to further aid stabilization. Excavation will be limited to 6 feet deep and is not expected to
exceed 15 feet from the shoreline. This method of stabilization and restoration is known as a Toe
Wood and Root Wad process, and is illustrated in Figure 3.

Nature has periodically wreaked havoc
over the recent past, with some of the
worst disasters occurring in 1972, 1998
and 2010. During these events, heavy
flood waters both scoured and silted
over various portions of the landscape.
As shown in Figure 4, the PA lies
within the 100-year modern floodplain.

Project Setting
Geology and Soils
As shown in Figure 5, the underlying
geological formation is mapped as
Quaternary fluviatile terrace deposits
(Qt). These are late Pleistocene in age,
and made up of gravel, sand, silt, and
clay. Lithic materials include limestone,
dolomite and chert. Morphologically,
one could expect to encounter preserved
point bars, oxbows, and abandoned Figure 4. PA shown on modern floodplain map.
channel features (Barnes 1983; Stoeser et al. 2005).
As shown in Figure 6, there are two different soil types that will be impacted by the project.
Approximately 95 percent of the Project Area is covered with Oakalla (Ok) soils. Approximately
5 percent of the Project Area is covered with Seawillow clay loam (SeB). These are both deep,
well-drained, and nearly level loamy soils on floodplains and adjacent gentle slopes, and form
in calcareous loamy alluvium of Holocene age, derived from mixed sources (Batte 1984; Web
Soil Survey 2012). Typical profiles of the Oakalla and Seawillow soils are as follows:
Oakalla soils, 0-2 percent slopes, frequently flooded (Ok)
0-15 cm: Grayish brown and very dark grayish brown silty clay loam; moderate fine angular
and subangular blocky structure; firm to very hard; calcareous and moderately alkaline; clear
smooth lower boundary

79-107 cm: Brown to dark brown silty
clay loam; moderate fine subangular

calcium carbonate films and threads;
40-45 percent calcium carbonates;

107-158 cm: Yellowish brown to dark

Seawillow clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (SeB)
0-27 cm: Grayish brown clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm to very
hard; 40-50 percent calcium carbonates; moderately alkaline; diffuse lower boundary
27-65 cm: Very pale brown clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm to very

65-150 cm: Very pale brown clay loam; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; firm to very
hard; 70 percent calcium carbonates (lime); moderately alkaline and limy throughout; diffuse
lower boundary
In sum, because these soils are typically very deep and are of Late Pleistocene and Holocene
age, they have the potential for encapsulating intact, well-stratified prehistoric cultural
components to great depths. However, considering that the Project Area has been the subject of
numerous dynamic flooding events, stream revetment and re-routing episodes that have occurred

4

during modern development along the
Guadalupe River in historic times, the
normal deposition sequences are not
likely to retain their original integrity,
and the typical soil columns as
described above should be used only as
reference points for geomorphological
and archaeological investigations.

Cultural Context and
Chronology
Introduction
The Project Area is located within the
Central Texas archaeological region
(Figure 7), and as such, prehistoric
cultural affinities most common to the
Central Texas hill country cultures are
often manifested in archaeological sites
along the upper Guadalupe River basin.
The most basic chronology of the Figure 6. Soils to be dissected by the Carowest
Central Texas regions can be divided Project.
into either: (1) prehistoric cultural
groups with no specific tribal affiliation, or; (2) historically documented groups with a
designated tribal or band name. Before Spanish soldiers and Catholic missionaries arrived in
Texas, the cultural activities of the groups of prehistoric Native Americans who inhabited the
region can only be surmised from what we can glean from the archaeological records at
undisturbed, and well-documented sites. Historic cultural groups are those observed firsthand
by the Spanish soldiers and priests beginning in the late 1500s. The Spanish then began
recording their encounters by writing the names, numbers, and living conditions of the many
groups of Native Americans who lived in the region. However, there is a significant transition
era between the least archaeologically known prehistoric cultural groups, and the historic Native
Americans that the Spanish documented; the transition era occurs in the 1500s when Spanish
explorers and treasure seekers ventured through Texas.
The Prehistoric Chronology
Based on research in Texas over the past 70+ years, beginning with professionals from the
University of Texas at Austin, archaeologists have been able to segregate the prehistoric period
in Central Texas into the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods (Figure 8). Although
other archaeologists have made significant foundational contributions to our current
understanding of how past cultures changed through time (e.g., Story 1985; Prewitt 1981), the
most current and widely recognized chronology for Central Texas is that offered by Michael
5

Collins (1995; 2004).

Paleoindian Period
(11,500-8,800 years
ago)
With minor differences
observed in the
archaeological record
across the wide expanse
of Central Texas, this
period spans the past
years estimated at
between ca. 11,500 and
8,800 years ago (Collins
1995:381–383; 2004).
Diagnostic artifacts
include a unique, fluted,
finely flaked, and bladeshaped spear or dart
point called “Clovis”,
other s tone tools

and unique prismatic Figure 7. Map of Central Texas Archaeological Region (adapted

systematically knocked
off from river cobbles. Archaeologists have documented Clovis-age sites in Central and South
Texas such as killsites, quarries, stone tool caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials
(Collins 1995:381–383; 2004). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly
common in Central and South Texas; however, no campsites or killsites have been found south
of Bexar County (Hester 1995:434–435).
During this 2,700-year Paleoindian period around the Project Area, the Native Americans we
term as the Paleoindian culture were likely one of small bands of nomadic, big-game hunters
following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and
horse that are now extinct in North America (Black 1989). Nevertheless, when big game was
not available, we have archaeological evidence that the Paleoindian peoples supplemented their
diet by eating turtles, tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons (Collins 1995:381; 2004).

Archaic Period (8,000-1,200 years ago)
Primarily, by studying the differences in the stone tools, the diversities in campsites or other
types of sites, the locations of the sites, as well as many other measurable and analytical
observations such as ethnobotanical and faunal remains found at Central Texas archaeological
sites, archaeologists have been able to dissect about 6,000 years of our past into what we
commonly term the “Archaic”. Based on these same aforementioned affinities, the Archaic has
further been defined in terms of the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic, and the Late Archaic.
Early Archaic (ca. 8,800-6,000 years ago)
The region was most probably occupied by small groups who moved almost constantly during
the Early Archaic period. Archaeologists have observed a distinctive change in projectile point
styles that are unique to this period; they include Early Corner Notched and Early Basal Notched
dart points. Although they were still very much hunters and gatherers, the large animals such as
mammoths that their Paleoindian ancestors had hunted were by this time extinct. To survive,
they capitalized on exploiting the other abundant food resources that Central Texas had to offer
—such as deer, fish, rodents, prickly pear tunas, and various plant bulbs and tubers.
Archaeologists point to the increased numbers of ground stone, firecracked limestone used in
cooking ovens larger in size than normal campfires, and specialized stone processing tools as
evidence that Native Americans refocused their pursuit of foodstuffs (Weir 1976; McKinney
1981; Story 1985; Collins 1995; Hester 1995).
Middle Archaic (ca. 6,000-4,000 years ago?)
When this period actually began and ended is always debatable among archaeologists. Some
(e.g., Collins 1995; 2004) see a significant pattern in the archaeological record between 6,000
and 4,000 years ago, but others (e.g., Hester 1995) don’t think the same changes were prevalent
until much later in South Texas - about between 4,500 and 2,400 years ago. Nevertheless, the
climate began changing in Central Texas beginning around 6,000 years ago, and a continuum
of dry climate known as the Altithermal, is believed by some archaeologists to have caused the
Native Americans to gather in larger groups. They gathered in large groups to exploit plant foods
that were more dependable than larger game animals such as bison (Sollberger and Hester
1972:338; Weir 1976:125, 128; Story 1985:40). Archaeologists have found more sites that date
to this period, and in Summer seasons the groups apparently took advantage of the numerous
prickly pear tunas and pads that thrived in the environs of South-Central Texas, as well as deer
and rabbit (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15; Collins 1995:38; 20043).
Later, they apparently congregated along the many creeks and rivers in the area to gather the
abundant and nutritional nuts ripening in the Fall (Black 1989). On the Edwards Plateau, they
may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large cooking ovens to steam the tanic
acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large cooking ovens were apparently
used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used within just a few years or over
several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus seems to be that they were used
to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin
et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds of accumulated firecracked rocks
are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological community, but are sometimes referred
8

to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
Late Archaic (4,000-1,200 years ago?)
As with the Middle Archaic period, differences in the traits of Native Americans inhabiting
Central Texas during the Late Archaic period may have occurred over several hundred years.
Whether it was a matter of cultural adaptation or an adaption to the environment is questionable.
In either case, the uniqueness seen in archaeological sites of the two regions imply that change
may have been slower in South Texas than in Central Texas.
Collins (1995; 2004) dates the final interval of the Archaic in Central Texas to approximately
4,000–1,200 years ago. The large cooking ovens which after repeated uses coalesced into burned
rock middens, intensified during the Late Archaic (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). Some
researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while
others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30). Although
the Native Americans of Central Texas still sought the abundant acorns, prickly pear, and
riverine plant foods such as nuts, the slightly cooler and moister climate allowed them to pursue
other food goods. Even though by about 1,500 years ago the gregarious, large herds of bison
no longer predominated the now-dwindling grasslands of Central Texas (Dillehay 1974), the
Native Americans still hunted and/or gathered deer and smaller animals such as rabbits, rodents,
fish, and turtles (Black 1989:30).
Although farther south, near Brownsville and Rockport, the Native Americans inhabiting those
areas began making pottery about 1,800 years ago, those groups farther to the north, around the
Guadalupe River area, either elected not to make pottery vessels, lacked the skills, or because
of their generally highly nomadic lifestyle, simply elected not to use the easily breakable vessels
until 1,000± years later (Story 1985:45–47). In addition to the uniqueness of Central Texas’
hunter-gatherers not adapting to the use of pottery, archaeologists have also observed a
noticeable change in the styles/types of killing dart points used during the Late Archaic. Dart
points were manufactured to be used with the atlatyl, a spear-like shaft with a dart point attached
to it, and thrown or launched from over the shoulder. It would not be until perhaps 1,200 years
ago that the bow-and-arrow was adapted for use for hunting in the region. Late Archaic dart
points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points, and the most common dart points
that are found within the area are what archaeologists call Ensor and Frio types (Turner and
Hester 1999:114,122).
As with most spectrums of scientific research, there is ongoing speculation amongst professional
archaeologists as to when, and what traits mark a transition between the Late Archaic, huntergatherer practices of Central Texans and the Late Prehistoric peoples who presumably began to
settle down into territorial groups claiming a part of the landscape as their own.
Transitional Archaic (2,300 - 1,300 years ago?)
A clear and abrupt transition of Native Americans adapting or developing the traits that
archaeologists define as being inclusive to the Late Archaic period, separate from the Late
Prehistoric period, around the Project Area is simply not distinct in the many sites that
archaeologists have been able to excavate and analyze. In effect, some of the same
9

characteristics that archaeologists see in Late Archaic artifacts and earlier Late Prehistoric
assemblages left behind are nearly identical - or at least transitional in technology and style.
Therefore, some archaeologists prefer to deem this transitional period as the “Terminal, or
Transitional Archaic”, spanning from approximately 1,200 to perhaps as long ago as 2,300 years
ago - depending on where in Central Texas the groups who left behind the now-present
archaeological sites were living (Weir 1976; Hester 1995). Nevertheless, the increased number
of burned rock midden sites that archaeologists have documented in Central Texas, and that date
to this time period, suggest that people returned time and again to the same sites to once again
take advantage of cooking and eating the abundant plants available during this time (e.g.,
Mauldin et al. 2003).
Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1,250-300 Years Ago)
Although artifacts commonly associated with earlier Late Archaic occupations are also found
on some Late Prehistoric-in-age archaeological sites, archaeologists have documented a distinct
change in projectile point styles that Native Americans began manufacturing about 1,250 years
ago. These stone points suggest that Native Americans in the Central Texas region surrounding
the PA adapted the bow-and-arrow as a weapon rather than the shoulder-thrown atlatyl with a
dart point attached. As such, the stone points devised for killing became much smaller and
streamlined. In layman terminology, the smaller, sleeker shafts arrow shafts carried an
“arrowhead”, instead of a dart point. Archaeologists have found Edwards and Scallorn arrow
points dating to the earliest 600+ years of the period (e.g., Goode 1991:71). Concurrently,
excavations by professional archaeologists have provided evidence that Native Americans began
using crude clay pottery vessels made from local clays, as well as perhaps trading vessels from
the South, Southeast Coastal, and Northeast Texas regions. As with any successful venture, the
making of pottery was refined so that vessels were used more, and the technique of firing
became perhaps an art (e.g., Story 1985:45-47; Black 1989:32; Hester 1995; Nickels 2000).
Archaeologists probably know more about the Native Americans who lived in Texas during this
time than any other time in prehistory (Hester 1995). They continued to build large cooking
ovens, or burned rock middens in which they roasted tubers, nuts, and some game animals (see
for example, Mauldin et al. 2003). During this same period, the inhabitants may have increased
their dependence upon bison (Steele and Assad- Hunter 1986:468). Huebner (1991) suggests
that the sudden return of bison to Central Texas resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains
north of Texas, and increased grassiness in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north
Central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of
the Edwards Plateau (Huebner 1991:354–355).
One theory is that perhaps there were not as many people occupying Central Texas and the area
during the Late Prehistoric period (Black 1989:32). We do know that they began occupying the
limestone overhangs and rockshelters created by the many creeks and rivers cutting into the
Balcones Escarpment limestone cliffs. Examples of rockshelters occupied by Native Americans
along the escarpment include Scorpion Cave beside the Medina River in Medina County
(Highley et al. 1978), Classen Rockshelter along Cibolo Creek in northern Bexar County (Fox
and Fox 1967), and Timmeron Rockshelter in Hays County (Harris 1985).

10

Historic Period
Primarily beginning slightly over 350 years ago, European explorers, entrepreneurs, Catholic
missionaries, and government officials encroached into what is today Central Texas in everincreasing numbers. This transitional end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic
period in both Central Texas is characterized by a continuum of written accounts of European
contact with the numerous indigenous, Native American groups encountered in the region. In
Central Texas, we can be ever grateful to the meticulous writings of the Spanish priests and
government officials for their recording of the names, numbers, and lifeways of the indigenous
groups. Dr. Thomas Hester (1995) is most often credited with recognizing this transitional
period between the Late Prehistoric and the Historic, and labels this largely unknown period as
the “Protohistoric.”
Traveling northward from present-day central Mexico in the 1500s and 1600s, the Spanish
encountered numerous small groups of Coahuiltecans (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell
1981; Hester 1989; John 1975; Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). In later years, intrusive groups
such as the Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche took over the lands roamed by the
Coahuiltecans (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989; Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993;
Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
For example, around A.D. 1700, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed northward
by continual Spanish expansion. But by about 1750, the Apache, adapting to a more Southern
Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting, entered what is today’s Texas from the northwest. Their
incursion was especially rapid because they had acquired horses from the Spaniards (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27). As if the indigenous groups were not effectively dispersed and
disrupted by the Apaches, the remnants of native American cohesion that previously existed in
Central Texas were even further disrupted by the nomadic, bison-hunting Comanche from the
High Plains of Texas (Campbell 1991:111).
Thus ensued over a century of turmoil for those numerous, but splintered Native American
groups who had established a semi-permanent foothold in Central Texas before the arrival of
the Apache and Comanche. They must have been heavily traumatized and significantly
demoralized over the constant conflicts resulting in death, and the mysterious diseases caused
by the forced continual mixing and remixing among ethnicities from around the regions and the
world (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Supposedly, there were dozens if
not hundreds of language dialects that were spoken by the earlier inhabitants, but nearly all have
been lost (e.g. Johnson 1994; Johnson and Campbell 1992).
Amidst the turmoil, the Spanish Catholic missions became a refuge for many of the otherwise
dispersed bands and tribes within Texas. By the early 1700s, several missions had been
established, and reestablished within the Nacogdoches and San Antonio areas (Campbell and
Campbell 1985; Chipman 1992; de la Teja 1995; Habig 1968a, 1968b; Hard et al. 1995). Those
that entered the missions did so usually voluntarily, seeking refuge from more powerful, warring
bands or tribes. Others did so because they were starved for food that the protective missions
could offer in seasons of natural destitution. Regardless, the Spanish government saw the
Catholic religious zeal as a means of peaceful conquest in an otherwise untenable, unsettled, and
11

hostile environment. At the same time, each and every Native American who relied upon support
from the Spanish missions became less of a threat to eventual Spanish domination of the region,
and infiltration by France or other countries (Campbell 1975:2; 1991:346–347).
Although a treaty with the Apaches in 1749 brought peace for a while, Apaches continued to
range over the area between San Antonio and Laredo until the early 1800s, pushed southward
by the invading Comanche who had moved into the Hill Country of Central Texas (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27; de la Teja 1995:100). In 1785, a peace treaty was agreed to in Santa Fe,
New Mexico between the Spanish Crown and the Comanches. Although the ceremony of this
treaty took place hundreds of miles to the west, its signing signaled the opening of a period of
peaceful coexistence during which Comanches brought hides, meat, and tallow to San Antonio
to trade for goods and services not available elsewhere, such as blacksmithing and gun repair
(Fehrenbach 1983:221-224; Poyo and Hinojosa 1991:125-126).
In 1821, after a hard-fought rebellion, Mexico gained its national sovereignty from Spain;
including the vast expanse that was to become the Republic of Texas. After only 15 years, the
combined Tejano and Euro-American compatriots rebelled against Mexican rule, and defeated
the Mexican army to declare an independent Republic of Texas in 1836. By the 1840s, the city
of San Antonio was well-established as the most progressive and most populated city in the
newly formed Republic.
Weary of warfare with the Comanche, a few Apache were beginning to seek asylum in the
missions (McGraw and Hindes 1987:367; West 1904:50).
The newly formed government of Texas gave land grants that were large, consisting of around
5,000 acres for each property, and Spanish cattle ranching became prevalent south and southeast
of San Antonio (Jackson 1986), however the vast expanse west of San Antonio was not settled
until the late 1800s.
Upon winning its independence from Mexico in 1836, a struggling young Republic of Texas
continued the empresario (colonization) system as a means of bringing new families to settle and
develop the land. Earlier grants of huge tracts of land to empresarios such as Stephen F. Austin
Texas, Green DeWitt, Haden Edwards, Sterling Robertson, John McMullen, and others proved
successful in establishing communities in south and east Texas. Around 1840 settlers from
Germany and Alsace-Lorraine, and from other regions of the United States began to flood into
San Antonio and New Braunfels. Many of the Germans moved into the Hill Country to the
north, settling into communities such as Boerne, and raised sheep or cattle (Freeman 1994:5-9).
Under President Sam Houston’s second term in 1842, Henry Fisher, Burchard Miller, and Joseph
Baker petitioned the Republic of Texas for authorization to establish 1,000 families in an area
consisting of over 3 million acres of land between the Colorado and Llano Rivers. Permission
was granted to Fisher and Miller to begin recruiting 600 immigrant families who would be given
640 acres per family, provided they build a cabin and farm 15 acres of fenced land. However,
settlement in the area did not come easy. The objective of luring 600 families (later increased
to 6,000 by the Republic of Texas) could not be accomplished for two principal reasons: (1)
portions of the tract encompassed the hunting grounds of the Comanches who were not about
to relinquish their domain without a fight, and (2) the area was well west of the main San
12

Antonio – Mexico trade routes (Biesele 2012:76-110).
Following a chain of events that led to the Fisher-Miller Grant being acquired by the
Adelsverein (the Society for the Protection of German Immigrants in Texas), John O.
Muesebach as Commissioner-General of the organization sent a survey party to the San Saba
River area near Menard to investigate the possibilities of mineral wealth and tillable farmland
available within the western portion of the Grant. Well aware that he would be encroaching upon
Comanche territory, he met with a group of Comanche chiefs for three days in March 1847 and
negotiated a treaty of peaceful coexistence with them (King 1967:111-118). Speaking through
an interpreter, Muesebach’s treaty proposal to the Comanche chiefs (from Tiling 1913:100) was
as follows:
1. “My countrymen have the permission to go and travel where they please, and no harm
must be done to them, but you must protect them everywhere. On the other hand, your
people can come to our wigwams and cities without fear and can go wherever they
please and shall be protected.”
2. “You the chiefs, and your people will assist us and report to us, when bad men and
redfaces of other tribes steal our horses or intend other felonies, and we shall do the
same, when you are attacked.”
3. I am going to send men with the thing that steals the land (compasses), as the red men
call it, and will survey the whole country of the San Saba as far as the Concho and other
waters, so that we may know the boundaries where we can go and till the soil. And if you
are willing after consultation with your warriors, to make this treaty, then I will give you
and your squaws many presents, that we call dollars, and give you as many as one

The following May the chiefs finalized the agreement by coming into Fredericksburg to sign the
treaty and collect the money promised them (King 1967:118). Thus, German immigration into
the lands west of San Antonio and Austin began in the 1830s and is fairly well documented. By
the 1840s new routes and trails were being established through the largely unsettled area, due
in part to the desire to reach the gold fields of California. “German immigrants established
Sisterdale in 1847, Tusculum (Boerne) in 1849. Currey’s Creek in 1850, and Comfort in 1854"
(Smryl 1996:1062).
In 1845, Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels purchased 1,245 acres in the Veramindi grant, and
established what would become the City of New Braunfels. Comal County was then cut out of
Bexar County in 1846, and Blanco and Kendall counties were subsequently cut out of Comal
County in 1858.

Site Types That Could be Expected Along the Project Area
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Comal and Guadalupe counties are prehistoric open
campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period (see Figure
8). Some of these represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans
may have camped for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas
representing large groups of people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with
ancestral groups returning to these same campsites over a period of several thousands of years.
Cultural remains to be found at these large campsites include among other items, an abundance
of firecracked rocks representing multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the
lithic debris that results from making them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and
seeds, faunal remains from terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds,
and mussel and snail shells. Open campsites occur in all types of environments, whether that be
in a plush riverine environment that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and animal
foodstuffs, or in the uplands away from flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses,
shrubs, and cacti offered a different food source that could be exploited such as various grass
seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads and tunas, and agave hearts. In addition, at various
times, bison were known to graze on the northern South Texas Plains, and were highly sought
after for use as food, hides, and bone tools (Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of Central Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients
that can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a
well-preserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most
frequently occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in
upland settings where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients
that archaeologists look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic
preservation in the form of charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation,
temporally diagnostic stone tools or ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that could be expected
along the Guadalupe River. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken
tools that were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old
ones. The general absence of firecracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at
open campsites suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period
of time ( However, small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles
to make them more knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the
natural outcroppings or surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite
cobbles. Examples of chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with
one or two flakes removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from
experience the quality of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool
production, so they ‘tested’ the cobble to judge whether it was usable or not. If the quality was
judged to be inferior, then the cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested
14

cobbles found on these sites are of poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished
stone tool products are carried away from these sites, what remains are those tools broken during
the manufacturing process, and the thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and
angular debris. Also unique to lithic scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry
blanks’. These are simply cobbles flaked on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable
‘blank’ that can be used to further reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken
off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks are usually not found on these sites because they have been
carried off, presumably to areas of south Texas where raw material is not readily available. The
snapped or broken quarry blanks are of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found
on any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops
that were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried
today, and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and the dynamics
of landscape evolution through time. Most lithic scatters in Comal and Guadalupe counties have
been documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also can range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but
differ from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at
times they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were
not yet freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types
of sites are rare in South Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally do not
present themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in Central Texas, it is much easier to pick up
gravels from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped stone
remains likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as
well as parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected.
Because of the many limestone formations with chert inclusive gravels prehistoric quarries or
procurement sites in Central Texas are not infrequent.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
Burned rock middens result from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed
much like modern-day roasting pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses,
as the larger rocks that serve as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less
effective as a thermal source, they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit
becomes unusable, another is dug near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple
pits and the ‘pitched out’ firecracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as
indiscernible. (For a full discussion of the formation of burned rock middens and their
documented presence in Texas, see Leach and Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al.
2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in
Central Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open
campsites in both upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams, within rock shelter
overhangs, and within limestone sinkholes.
15

Historic Sites
As discussed above in the Cultural Chronology section above, Spanish entradas with
government officials and Catholic priests began recording their encounters with local Native
American groups as early as the late 1500s. Spanish crossings of the Comal River and their visits
to the Comal Springs from perhaps as early as 1691, and through 1758 when the Spanish
mission established near there was abandoned have been documented. The earliest Spanish
expeditions likely followed pre-established Indian trails used for centuries, and for the most part
they used Indian guides. These trails and routes used by the early Spanish visitors turned into
a network of Caminos Reales, or royal roads (Foster 1995). However, there are no known
documents that would suggest a permanent Spanish presence in the Project Area.

Archeological Atlas Site Results
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archeological sites (Atlas 2012)
indicated that the PA had not been subjected to a formal cultural resources survey. However, as
shown in Figure 9, there have been five archaeological surveys conducted within one kilometer.
In 1981, the Environmental Protection Agency conducted a survey in advance of the
construction of a sewer lift station (labeled in Figure 9 as “EPA 1981"). In 1986 and 1991,
surveys along IH-35 and FM 46 were conducted by the Federal Highway Administration
(labeled in Figure 9 as “FWHA 1986" and “FHWA 1991").
In 2006, Archaeologists from Halff Associates, Inc. conducted cultural resource investigations
for the City of New Braunfels for the proposed modifications to the South Tributary of the
Guadalupe River in Comal and Guadalupe counties. The proposed project consisted of widening
and deepening approximately 2.6 miles of existing channel extending from just west of the
Guadalupe River upstream to FM 1044 at Lou Ann Drive, the construction of a culvert where
Lou Ann Drive crosses the channel, and the construction of a 35-acre detention pond south of
County Line Road and east of FM 1044.
The fifth nearby survey was undertaken in October of 2010 by archeologists from Hicks &
Company of a 2.10-acre tract of the New Braunfels Utilities’ proposed Rio Lift Station
Relocation project located in the City of New Braunfels (labeled in Figure 9 as “CoNB Hicks
& Co. 2010"). The proposed project involved the construction of a new lift station with an
associated electrical building and odor control facilities outside of the current FEMA floodplain,
along with demolition of the old Rio Lift Station structure, construction of a drop shaft located
north of the Guadalupe River, construction of a gravity sewer from the proposed new location
south of the Guadalupe River, and open-trench construction of two parallel force mains from the
proposed lift station to the existing North Kuehler Wastewater Treatment Plant.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing and backhoe trenching.
The topics addressed were site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The
prehistoric theoretical framework is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility,
subsistence, and social systems for the Central Texas region. The historic framework is
structured around the settlement along the Guadalupe River as documented in the earliest written
accounts by Spanish priests and government representatives, through Mexican and Republic of
Texas sovereignty, and into the Texas Statehood period.
The goals of the project were to:
1)
locate and record cultural locations and sites in the Project Area using a
systematic survey methodology;
2)
quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,
3)
place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Pre-field Preparation
Before the official survey
began, the Principal
Investigator reviewed design
plans for restoration (see Figure
4), and then inspected the
project area with Pape-Dawson
environmentalists to better
understand the topography,
surface visibility, and site
potential. In addition, he met
with Mr. Bobby Sheehan, the
ranch manager, to discuss the
survey strategy and methods
within the PA.
The Survey
In accordance with Texas Figure 10. Filled in area along the existing remnants of the
Historical Commission (THC) retaining wall; facing north.
and Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic, 100-percent pedestrian
survey along the 3,200-foot linear shoreline was conducted. Old retaining walls were still extant
along only approximately 1,000 feet of the shoreline (Figure 10). Otherwise, the remaining
approximately 2,200 feet of the shoreline had been wasted by recent flooding (Figures 11 and
12).
18

Surface visibility ranged from
20 to 100 percent along the
shoreline, and a total of 11
auger tests were placed every
100 meters along the shoreline
(Figures 13 and 14). The results
of auger testing were fully
documented on a standard auger
test form. The auger tests were
excavated in 20-centimeter
(cm) levels, and all sediments
were screened through 1/4-inch
wire mesh.
The shoreline and cutbanks
were examined for potentially
intact cultural deposits and Figure 11. Wasted shoreline along the southern portion of the
features, and the cutbanks were PA; facing north.
photographed.
In accordance with a general
“no collection” policy, cultural
material of a redundant nature,
both prehistoric and historic,
observed either on the surface
or within auger tests or
cutbanks were not to be
collected. Instead, they were to
be fully documented via
sketches, field photographs, and
copious notes, and their
locations recorded with a handheld GPS. Following that, they
were to be returned to the
surface if surface finds, or to the Figure 12. Tree stump was on shoreline before 2010 flood;

facing east.
Exceptions were diagnostic artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be considered as
significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian
transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and
that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator/Project Archaeologist in the field.
Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences within the PA were to be
documented as archaeological sites. In addition, any potentially historic buildings 45 years or
older that were located adjacent to the PA were to be documented with photographs and
included in this report of investigations.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Auger Testing
It should be noted here
that March 3, 2012
proved to be an
opportune time to
c o n d u c t
a n
archaeological survey
because the level of
Lake Dunlap was 45
centimeters (cm) below
normal, as the
Guadalupe Blanco River
Authority (GBRA) had
recently lowered the
lake level, controlled by
dams on the Guadalupe
River. Figure 15 shows
the normal water level
on Cypress trees across
from the PA.
Figure 15. Normal water level on Cypress trees across form the PA;
facing east.
Surface visibility ranged from <5 percent to 100 percent along the surface. However, as stated
above, approximately 2/3 of the shoreline had been heavily eroded, exposing adjacent cutbanks
in those areas for examination (see for examples, Figures 16-21).

No evidence of prehistoric or historic cultural material was observed either on or below the
surface during the survey. However, modern flood debris was occasionally encountered in the
auger tests, and observed within the cutbanks (see for example, Figure 21). The results of auger
testing are presented in Appendix A. No standing structures 45 years and older were observed
along the PA.

23

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A 100% pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility within the Project
Area was conducted, along with the excavation of 11 auger tests. No evidence of either
prehistoric or historic cultural resources were observed. Therefore, we recommend that the
Carowest riparian restoration project be allowed to proceed as currently designed. The project
should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered as eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State Archeological
Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should be allowed to proceed without further
archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined and evaluated
by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas Historical
Commission.
