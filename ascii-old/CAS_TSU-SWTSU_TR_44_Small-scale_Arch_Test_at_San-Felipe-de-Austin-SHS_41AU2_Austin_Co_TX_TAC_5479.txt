Abstract
On January 26, 2010, archaeologists from the Center for Archaeological Studies, Texas State
University-San Marcos (CAS) conducted shovel test and limited small-scale test unit excavations at the
San Felipe de Austin State Historic Site (41AU2). The Texas Historical Commission (THC) Historic
Sites Division, which manages the site, is planning to renovate an existing structure into a temporary
visitors center and to install a small number (n=5) of informational signs displaying important details
about the history of the site. CAS excavated shovel tests in each of the proposed interpretive sign
locations in addition to thirteen small-scale test units around the perimeter of the J.J. Josey Store, the
location of the temporary visitors center.
Excavation of the small-scale test units around the J.J. Josey Store revealed deposits suggesting that
a structure or structures may have once been located in this area. Proposed improvements to the J.J.
Josey Store will not impact these deposits.

State Historic Site (Figure 1). The site is under the
jurisdiction of the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) Historic Sites Division, which is planning
to install five new interpretive signs presenting
information to visitors. An existing structure,

installing new piers beneath the structure; these
piers will extend minimally beneath the ground
surface. Additionally, a new restroom will be
added to the rear of the building. Depth of impact
in this area is estimated to be approximately 1

designation as a State Archeological Landmark
(SAL) (13 TAC 26.8) to determine whether the
proposed undertaking will affect archaeological
historic properties (36 CFR 800.16(1)) or SALs
(13 TAC 26.12).
All work was performed under an Antiquities
Permit Number 5479 from the THC, and complied
with all minimum standards and guidelines that
have been proposed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists and adopted by THC.

San Felipe de Austin State Historic Site is
recorded as Archaeological Site 41AU2, and in
1983 was designated as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL) (Howard 1996). The status of
this site as a SAL, in addition to the fact that
it is under the auspices of the THC, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, means that
proposed developments will need to be preceded
by archaeological work designed to identify and
characterize cultural deposits that will potentially
be affected. Such work is required under the
Texas Antiquities Code.

Work was conducted on January 26, 2010 and
consisted of the excavation of five shovel test units
in the location of the proposed interpretive signs.
Thirteen small-scale (30 x 30 cm) test units were
also excavated around the perimeter of the J.J.
Josey Store in advance of proposed modifications
to this structure.

Environmental Setting

The project is subject to the provisions of the
Texas Antiquities Code, now subsumed in Title
13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code.
This legislation defines the necessary conditions
for the recognition and preservation of State
Archeological Landmarks and requires that
any political subdivision of the State of Texas,
defined as a local government entity created and
operating under the laws of this state, including
a city, county, school district, or special district
created under the Texas Constitution, Article III,
52 (b)(1) or (2), or Article XVI, 59 in 13 TAC
26.5 of the code, must identify potential SALs
through survey of public lands prior to actions
that could potentially damage those SALs. The
codesâ provisions are administered by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) Archeology
Division. The proposed investigations will
evaluate any resources for eligibility and

San Felipe de Austin State Historic Site
(41AU2) is located in eastern Austin County,
immediately adjacent to the Brazos River and a
short distance north of the town of San Felipe
within the Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes
physiographic region of Texas (Figure 2). This
area is part of the Southern Lower Plains and is
characterized by gently rolling terrain and major
drainages, which include the Brazos River. State
Highway 1458 bisects 41AU2, and the historic site
park is located on the northwest side of Highway
1458 immediately before it crosses the Brazos
River.
Soils within the site area are largely alluvial
and colluvial in derivation; these have been
mapped by Greenwade (1984). Soils within the
historic site boundaries include Okalared very fine
2

sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (OkA), Silawa
loamy fine sand, 5 to 8 percent slopes (SID),
and Tabor fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes
(National Cooperative Survey 2009). Okalared
fine sandy loam is deep and nearly level, and has
the potential to contain archaeological materials
at considerable depth below the modern ground
surface. This soil typically has a surface layer
of brown very fine sandy loam approximately 8
inches (20.32 cm) thick, followed by a little over
60 inches (152.4 cm) of brown and light brown
silty loam interbedded with sandy loam and
loamy fine sand. This soil is well drained, and
occurs immediately along the Brazos River in
many places. Silawa loamy fine sand is also deep,
but more gently sloping than Okalared soils. It
predominates on ancient stream terraces, and is

limited to areas between 5 and 50 acres in size.
Silawa soil has a surface layer about 10 inches
(25.4 cm) in thickness characterized by dark
brown loamy fine sand. Immediately below this
are subsurface deposits of dark red sandy clay
loam (to 8 inches, or 20.32 cm) and yellowish red
sandy clay loam (to 36 inches, or 91.44 cm). This
soil is also well drained. Tabor fine sandy loam
is a deep, gently sloping soil found on upland
ridges. Areas range in size from 10 to as much
as ~100 acres in size. Tabor has a surface layer
about 9 inches (22.86 cm) thick of fine sandy
loam, followed by 6 inches (15.24 cm) of pale
brown fine sandy loam. These layers overlie
a subsurface that extends as deep as 69 inches
(175.26 cm) and consists of yellowish brown,
light gray, and light brownish gray clay. With

the strong clay subsurface, this soil drains only
moderately well compared with the two other soil
types in the project area.

While few habitation sites dating to the
Paleoindian period are known within the region,
Paleoindian lanceolate points, such as Clovis,
Scottsbluff, Plainview, Angostura, Meserve,
and San Patrice have been recorded in surficial
or disturbed context on the upper Texas coast
(Hester 1980; Patterson 1980; Wheat 1953).
During the Paleoindian period the coastline of
the Gulf of Mexico extended 30-40 km seaward
of its present location due to lower sea levels.
Sites dating to this period may now lie offshore
or within deeply buried terraces (Aten and Good
1984; Hester 1980). The end of the Paleoindian
period is characterized by a shift toward a more
broad-based subsistence strategy that may have
been precipitated by the extinction of megafauna
(Aten 1983; Willey and Phillips 1958).

Cultural Background
San Felipe de Austin State Historic Site
(41AU2) is where, in 1824, Stephen F. Austin
brought 297 families to help colonize Texas
under contract with the Government of Mexico.
This town was the political and economic capital
of the Texas colony for the next 12 years, before
Texas won its independence from Mexico at the
Battle of San Jacinto in 1836. In addition to the
historic remains relating to the siteâs period as an
early town site, previous investigations at 41AU2
have recorded prehistoric remains. The project
area falls within the southeast Texas cultural area
(Howard et al. 1991), a region known for its rich
and diverse prehistoric archaeological resources.
The following section is divided into a summary
of the prehistoric cultural background of the
project area and a historic cultural background
of the site.

Archaic
The Archaic period is characterized by
sea level rise and climate fluctuations between
7000 BC and AD 100 (Aten 1983). The period
is generally subdivided into the early, middle,
and late periods (Story 1985). While several
projectile point sequences have been proposed
for the Archaic period in southeast Texas (Ensor
et al. 1990; Patterson 1985, 1995; Story 1990),
the time span for particular point types remains
poorly understood.

Prehistoric Cultural Background
The prehistoric cultural sequence of southeast
Texas is divided into three broad periods:
Paleoindian, Archaic, and Ceramic (Howard and
Ringstaff 1999). The Paleoindian period dates
from 10,000 to 7000 BC (Aten 1983:141, 144152), the Archaic from 7000 BC to AD 100 (Aten
1983:153; Story 1985:37) and the Ceramic from
AD 100 to AD 1500 (arrival of Europeans in the
region) (Aten 1983).

A few Early Archic (7000 BC to 3000 BC)
sites are recorded within the region (Aten 1983;
Story 1985) and are located inland from the coast.
Dart point types often associated with the Early
Archaic in the area include Wells, Bell, and Baird
(Patterson 1995; Story 1985). Bell and Baird
points are nonlocal (Fields 1988:203) and may
be indicative of interaction with Central Texas
cultures (Howard and Ringstaff 1999).

4

By the Middle Archaic (3000 to 1000 BC) sea
levels reached their current extent. Occupation
continued at inland locations indicated by dart
points such as Gary, Kent, Bulverde, Pedernales,
Lange, and Williams (Patterson 1985). Pedernales
points are also nonlocal and may be indicative of
continued interaction with Central Texas cultures
(Turner and Hester 1993; Fields 1988:203).
This time-span is also characterized by the
establishment of cemeteries along major streams
suggesting the onset of territorialism (Howard
and Ringstaff 1999, Story 1985:44-47).

the use of plain sandy paste ceramics (Howard
and Ringstaff 1999). The project area lies near
the western extent of the Mossy Grove tradition
(Story 1990:257). Ceramic types from the earlier
part of this time period include Goose Creek
Plain, Incised, Red-Filmed, Tchefuncte Plain and
OâNeal Plain (Howard and Ringstaff 1999).
Populations continued to increase during
the Ceramic period and territories became more
pronounced with the establishment of at least
one cemetery per territory (Aten 1983; Howard
and Ringstaff 1999). By AD 600 arrow points
appear and by AD 1000 grog-tempered ceramics
are present (Aten 1983), however dart points
and sandy paste ceramics continue to be used
(Patterson 1995). Arrow point types include
Perdiz, Alba, Catahoula, Cliffton, and Scallorn
(Ensor et al. 1990:8). Grog-tempered ceramics
from the later part of this time period include
Baytown Plain and San Jacinto Incised (Aten
1983:239-242).

The Late Archaic (1000 BC to AD 100) is
characterized by significant population expansion
(Aten 1983; Patterson 1979) and the continued
use of large cemeteries (Howard and Ringstaff
1999). Dart points commonly associated with
this time period in the region include Gary, Kent,
Yarbrough, Ensor, Palmillas, and Ponchartrain
(Patterson 1985:255; 1995:251). Ponchartrain
dart points, a non-local point, are suggestive
of interaction with western Louisiana cultures
(Fields 1988:203; Turner and Hester 1993). Exotic
burial goods, including chert from central Texas,
marine shell from the Gulf Coast, and ground
stone artifacts from Arkansas, are also indicative
of far extending interaction networks (Hall
1981:289-309).

Historic
The Historic period begins in the area with
the arrival of Europeans in the sixteenth century.
By the seventeenth century, the French explorer,
La Salle, encountered the Coco (possibly related
to the Karankawa) occupying an area between the
Brazos and Lavaca Rivers (Campbell 1996:184185) in the general area of the project location.
The late appearance of Rockport ceramics in the
area, suggest that the Coco were recent arrivals
(Patterson 1995:249).

Ceramic
By AD 100 ceramics appear in the Galveston
Bay area (Aten 1983:287) and can be found in
the inner coastal plain by AD 400 (Ensor and
Carlson 1991:215). While rare at inner coastal
sites, ceramics are found in abundance at
coastal sites in the region dating to the Ceramic
period (AD 100 to AD 1500). The Mossy Grove
tradition is a heuristic concept put forth by Story
(1990b:256-258) that is used to describe a number
of ethnically distinct groups in the southeast
Texas region that are characterized by egalitarian
social organization, hunter-gather subsistence and

By the early eighteenth century, the Tonkawa
had extended their range to the inner coastal plain
between the Trinity and Brazos Rivers, formerly
Karankawa territory, in response to pressure from
other directions (Aten 1983:32). A previously
recorded historic Indian site, the Shanklin Site
(41WH8) is located approximately 30 miles to the
south-southwest of the project location. Artifacts
5

collected from the surface of this site included
Fresno, Guerrero, Cuney and Bulbar-stemmed
arrow points, a glass scraper, a 1738 Spanish
coin and Rockport ceramics with loop handles
(Hudgins 1986). The Tonkawa were forcibly
removed from the area in 1855 and settled on
several reservations far upstream on the Brazos
River. By 1859 they had been removed from
Texas all together and settled on reservations in
Oklahoma (Swanton 1952:329).

(Barker 1924; Moore 1929). Austin eventually
gained permission from Emperor AgustÃ­n de
Iturbide under the Imperial Colonization Law
of January 1823, which allowed Roman Catholic
immigrants to settle in Mexico. The law defined
land allocations in terms of leagues or sitios
(4,428 acres) and labors (177 acres). The law was
annulled by the emperorâs abdication in March
1823, but the new provisional government gave
Austin permission to settle 300 families on the
grant by special decree in April 1823.
In December 1823, the location for the town
site of San Felipe de Austin, named after the
Mexican governorâs patron saint and Stephen
F. Austin, was selected on a high prairie bluff
overlooking the Brazos River (Jackson 1996:840;
Moore 1929). The location had been previously
used as a river crossing on the lower Atascosito
Road, a Spanish trail between Goliad and the
Trinity River (Kemp 1996:274). The town
site was laid out on the Mexican grid system
with five public areas consisting of Commerce
Square, Constitution Square, Military Square,
the cemetery, and the house of charity (Jackson
1996:840). Ownership of town lots was based
on the ability to construct a house or cabin on
a single lot or groups of two to three lots within
a year of purchase (Barker 1918). The current
project area encompasses three town lots (Lots
13, 14, and 15), Commerce Street, and a portion
of Commerce Square (Figure 3). Lots 13, 14, and
15 were purchased by Stephen F. Austin prior
to 1831 and then conveyed to Anthony Butler in
April 1833 (Bradfield 1967; Bradfield and Henson
1970). The San Felipe de Austin town hall was
located on Lot 54, lying to the southwest and
adjacent to Lot 13 (Bradfield 1967:4-5; Bradfield
and Henson 1970; Smithwick 1900:41). The
ayuntamiento (municipal government) met at
the town hall as well as the Conventions of 1832
and 1833, and the Consultation of 1835 which
provided the foundation of the Texas Revolution.

Historic Cultural Background
The colonization of the lower Brazos River
region was first initiated by Moses Austin,
father of Stephen F. Austin (Gracy 1996:293).
In December of 1820, the Governor of Spanish
Texas, Antonio MarÃ­a MartÃ­nez granted the
elder Austin an empresario to settle 300 Roman
Catholic families from Spanish Louisiana in the
province of Texas (Gracey 1996:293). The area
designated for colonization extended from the
Gulf of Mexico, to the San Antonio-Nacogdoches
Road, to the Lavaca River, and to the San Jacinto
River (Jackson 1996:840). Unfortunately, Moses
Austin contracted pneumonia and died within
two months of receiving the empresario, leaving
the organization and settlement of the colony to
his son, Stephen F. Austin (Gracy 1996:293).
Stephen began recruiting colonists and by
1821 immigrants from Louisiana, Alabama,
Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri, Mississippi,
and other southern states began to enter the area
(Barker 1925:149-154). However the new colonists
could not gain titles to their land as Mexico had
gained independence from Spain in 1821 and the
provisional government did not recognize Austinâs
land grant. Austin traveled to Mexico City to
rectify the situation, leaving the colonists on their
own to face food shortages and encounters with
local Indians, leading many to depart the area
6

Town lots 13, 14, 15, 52, 53,
and 54 were initially owned by
Stephen F. Austin, and it was
some where upon this block
that his first home in Texas was
erected (Bradfield 1967:4). The
house had been built by 1824
and was described by Smithwick
(1900:56) as âa double log cabin
with a wide passage through the
center a porch with dirt floor on
the front with windows opening
upon it and chimney at each
end of the building.â A replica
of the dog-trot cabin currently
stands within the project area
(Figure 4, and Barker 1924). In
1829, Austin moved away from
the town site, taking residence
in the countryside and leased his
first home to James Whiteside,
who converted the residence
into a hotel (King 1981:52). The
Whiteside Hotel was a one-anda-half story, two room log cabin
that contained a central passage
(Smithwick
1900:41).
The
structure was used as a tavern,
an inn, and for public sales

60 volunteers from San Felipe de
Austin join Houstonâs troops on
March 19, 1836. Houstonâs troops
reached San Felipe de Austin on
March 26 and then continued
northward along the Brazos River
eventually establishing a camp
across the river from Groceâs
Plantation (Kindall 1989). Most
of the residence of San Felipe
de Austin had departed with the
volunteers on March 19 and by
the time Houston arrived at San
Felipe de Austin on March 26,
most of the town was deserted.
Houston left a rear guard at San
Felipe containing approximately
100 men commanded by
Moseley Baker, who had orders to burn the town
if Mexican troops were sighted. The burning was
ordered to keep the Mexican troops from settingup camp at San Felipe and seizing the colonistsâ
goods (King 1981:78-83). On March 31, 1836,
Bakerâs scouts Erastus Smith and John York
spotted Mexican cavalry approaching and the
town was immediately put to torch (Kuykendall
1903:41).

immigration restrictions put forth by the Mexican
government in 1830. The Convention of 1833, also
held in San Felipe de Austin, drafted a constitution
that made Texas a separate state from Coahuila
and asked for the repeal of the tariffs and laws
that deterred immigration. The Consultation of
1835 held in San Felipe considered the direction
Texans should take towards the dictatorship of
Santa Anna and provided for the establishment
of an army under the direction of General Sam
Houston. The town served as the capital of the
new Texas provisional government until March
1836 when the Consultation of 1836 convened up
the Brazos River at the town of Washington. San
Felipe de Austin was at its peak at this time with
a population of over 600 individuals and was only
second to San Antonio in commerce (Haskew
1969:30; Jackson 1996:840).

Mexican troops eventually entered San
Felipe de Austin on the morning of April 6, 1836,
surprising James M. Bell, William Simpson, and
Isaac L. Hill, who had been posted as guards
the previous evening (Kuykendall 1903:42-43).
While Bell and Hill were able to escape across the
Brazos River, Simpson was captured and taken to
Santa Anna. The Mexican army was forced to setup camp 400 to 600 yards southwest of the ferry
crossing at San Felipe due to the destruction of
San Felipe. The Texas rear guard then opened fire
on Santa Annaâs troops from the opposite bank
of the Brazos, behind a redoubt that had been
established. The Mexican troops dug a trench
on the south bank and installed two six-pound

Early in 1836, General Santa Anna of Mexico
amassed military troops and entered into Texas
in order to crush insurgent forces. After hearing
of the defeat of the Texas forces at the Alamo and
then at Goliad, General Sam Houston ordered
a withdrawal of forces towards the east in what
became known as the Runaway Scrape. A group of

cannons and returned fire (CastaÃ±eda 1928:73,
109). During the skirmish, the Texans lost one
man, John Bricker, a resident of San Felipe. A
memorial marker now stands within the project
area commemorating his death. Unable to cross
the Brazos at this location, Santa Anna marched
his troops 25 miles downstream and forded the
river at Fort Bend (CastaÃ±eda 1928:173).   

San Felipe de Austin that included the original
Commerce Square and surrounding land. The
San Felipe Memorial Park was evetually develped
into the San Felipe de Austin State Historic Site.
In 1940 the Corporation, the San Felipe Park
Association, and various individuals donated
additional tracts of land located along the Brazos
River to the State of Texas to be developed into
the Stephen F. Austin State Park (Howard and
Ringstaff 1999). Park development was assisted
by the National Park Service and included the
construction of picnic grounds and an 18-hole
golf course. This park is currently owned and
managed by Texas Parks and Wildlife. Four acres
of land next to the San Felipe de Austin State
Historic Site were ceded to the State Department
of Highways and Public Transportation in 1970
for the construction of Farm-to-Market Road 1458
(Howard and Ringstaff 1999). The San Felipe de
Austin State Historic Site was managed by the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department until the
property was transferred to the Texas Historical
Commission in 2008. The site is currently
under the management of the Texas Historical
Commission Historic Sites Division.

The Texas Revolution drew to an end with
the decisive victory at the Battle of San Jacinto on
April 21, 1836. Within six months a few families
had returned to San Felipe de Austin, but most of
the original citizens chose not to rebuild on the
original town site, and instead located their home
sites scattered across the prairie away from the
bluff along the Brazos River (Fox and Whitsett
1987:11). The town was eventually incorporated
and made the Austin County seat in 1837, but lost
that designation in 1846 when the county seat
was moved to Bellville. Following this loss, San
Felipe continued to decline. A traveler noted in
1854 that San Felipe contained only two stores
and six dwellings that were rapidly deteriorating
(Olmstead 1857:360). By 1900 the population of
San Felipe consisted of 241 individuals and had
fallen to 206 by 1910 (Howard and Ringstaff
1999). The ferry that was used to cross the Brazos
River for over 120 years was finally shut-down in
the 1940s. In 1972 a bridge was constructed near
the old ferry crossing along a section of FM 1458
that passes next to the project area (Howard and
Ringstaff 1999). Since the mid-1900s, the majority
of construction in San Felipe has occurred along
FM 1458, south of the original town site (Howard
and Ringstaff 1999).

There are currently eight structures and
monuments located within the boundaries of
San Felipe de Austin State Historic Site. A well,
believed to be the only surviving structure from
the original town site, is located in the eastern
portion of the project area (see Figure 3). The well
was constructed with hand-made bricks most
likely between 1824 (Hoff 1938:13) and 1830 by
James Whiteside, Jonathan Peyton, and Joseph
White, and was completed by John Jones in 1832
(Barker 1928:829). It was encased in concrete in
1929 (Moore 1929:159). An obelisk and stone
park marker, located at the entrance of the project
area, commemorating Stephen F. Austin as the
Father of Texas was installed in 1928 by the school
children of Austin County under the leadership of
school superintendent W.S. Smith (see Figure 3).

Historic Site
San Felipe Memorial Park was created in
1928 with land dedicated by the Corporation of

A bronze statue of Stephen F. Austin was erected
and unveiled on November 3, 1938 on Father of
Texas Day. A stone monument to John Bricker
was also installed in 1938, memorializing the only
death of a Texan during the skirmish between
Mexican and Texan forces at San Felipe in 1836
(Hoff 1938:13). The monument was replaced
in 1955 with a new monument erected by his
kinsmen. A series of four replicas of Stephen F.
Austinâs first log cabin have been erected within
the project area. The first was constructed in
1935 and the last in 1976 (Howard and Ringstaff
1999). A granite Texas Centennial historical
marker is located south of the replica cabin. The
marker was erected in 1936 and commemorates
the San Felipe de Austin Town Hall which held
the first and second Conventions of Texas in 1832
and 1833, and the Consultation of 1835. The J.J.
Josey General Store was moved onto the property
in 1970, having been relocated at least three times
since its original construction. The store was
built by John Crutcher on either Lots 15, 52, 53,
and/or 54 in 1847 (Haskew 1969:130). The 150year-old building was developed into a museum
by the Stephen F. Austin Park Association and
at one time housed a model of the original town
site as well as several nineteenth-century items
(Howard and Ringstaff 1999).

printed sherd, and one cut nail. This collection
is now curated at the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department headquarters in Austin (Howard and
Ringstaff 1999).
Investigations were conducted in 1969 in
advance of the construction of FM 1458. Harald
P. (Hall) Jenson Jr. and Ronald Ralph of the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department investigated and
recorded the portion of the original San Felipe de
Austin town site that fell within the boundaries
of the State Historic Site as 41AU2 (Jensen and
Ralph 1969). Jensen and Ralph collected artifacts
from the surface of three locations, two of which
are now covered by the embankment for FM 1458.
The third location, Area C, was next to the Stephen
F. Austin monument. Artifacts collected from this
location included many small fragments of clear
and olive glass (some burnt), stoneware, white
earthenware, hand-painted earthenware, annular
ware, edgeware, and transfer printed ware. This
collection is also currently curated at Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department headquarters in Austin
(Howard and Ringstaff 1999).
Plans to move the J.J. Josey Store onto the
siteâs property in 1970 resulted in investigations
conducted by J. David Ing of the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department. An area that had been
leveled by heavy equipment for the location of
the store was surveyed. Machine excavations
had uncovered blue transfer printed ware sherds,
glass bottle fragments, other glass fragments,
cut nails, brick rubble, and charcoal. Four small
shovel test units were excavated to estimate the
depth of the historic deposits and to explore for
possible brick wall lines. Brick fragments mixed
with charcoal and light gray sand were noted up
to a depth of 1 ft (30 cm). A fifth unit measuring
2.5 ft (76 cm) by 3 ft (91 cm) was excavated 102
ft (31 m) west of the 1824 well. At 1 ft (30 cm)
below surface, a patterned cluster of mortared
hand-made bricks was encountered, representing

Previous Investigations
The first archaeological investigations
conducted on the property of the San Felipe
de Austin State Historic Site were conducted
by J. Dan Scurlock of the office of the State
Archeologist in 1966. Investigations consisted of
the collection of surface artifacts located near the
replica cabin. The majority of artifacts collected
were ceramic, consisting of three blue edgeware
sherds, two annular ware sherds, one handpainted monochrome sherd, one brown transfer

State Historic Site. Investigations at the San
Felipe State Historic Site consisted of intensive
pedestrian survey and shovel test excavations.
A total of 2,522 artifacts were recovered from
22 shovel test units representing occupations
extending from 1823 to 1836 with traces of
prehistoric and later historic occupation.
Distribution of the artifacts suggests that several
activity areas and structures are buried within
the boundaries of the historic site (Howard et al.
1999).

The demolition of the third replica cabin
in 1972 resulted in machine disturbance of
up to a depth of 3 ft. A total of twelve ceramic
sherds were collected by George Kegley of the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department from the
disturbed areas around the cabin site (Kegley
1972). The sherds were included in analysis of
material collected from investigations conducted
of the site in 1995 by Texas Parks and Wildlife
Departments (Howard and Ringstaff 1999).
In 1985, Texas Parks and Wildlife personnel
J. David Ing, Art Black, and Robert Rayburn
conducted a surface examination of the historic
siteâs fence line and gopher mounds. Artifacts
noted included nineteenth-century ceramics,
glass, and nails. A posthole excavation in the
southwest corner of the property uncovered
bricks that may have been part of a historic wall
(Ing 1985).

Methods
Plans by the THC to enhance San Felipe de
Austin State Historic Site include transforming
an existing building, the-pier-and-beam J.J. Josey
Store, into a visitors center and installing five
(5) new interpretive signs across the site. The
J.J. Josey Store structure was built in 1847 but
has been moved several times from its original
location. It was moved to its present location in
1970.

In September 1986 and January 1987,
investigations of the historic site were conducted
by Daniel Fox and Hayden Whitsett of the Texas
Water Development Board. The survey was
guided by possible locations of the original town
site noted in research conducted by Margaret
Henson and Ganey Bradfield (Bradfield and
Henson 1970). Site 41AU2 was rerecorded and
expanded to include 148 acres of the original
town site. Their investigations asserted that site
41AU2 merited listing on the National Register of
Historic Places; the Texas Historical Commission
concurred on May 15, 1987 (Fox and Whitsett
1987).

Archaeologist from CAS excavated a total of
five (5) shovel tests, one in each of the locations
where the interpretive signs will be installed.
These locations were marked by THC staff
prior to the field work. Each of these shovel
tests measured no more than 30 cm in diameter,
and extended no deeper than 50 cm beneath the
surface.
In addition, CAS excavated thirteen (13)
small-scale test units around the perimeter of
the J.J. Josey Store. A new restroom facility will
be added to the rear of the building and new
piers will be installed beneath the structure, in
locations that are not accessible for shovel testing.
Therefore, the perimeter area was subject to test
unit investigations. The small-scale test units

Wildlife Department archeology survey team
conducted investigations of both the Stephen F.
Austin State Park and the San Felipe de Austin

were square, measuring 30 cm across, and were
excavated in 10 cm arbitrary levels. The test units
were spaced approximately 5 to 6 m apart around
the perimeter of the building. Units were placed
approximately 1.5 m away from the exterior of
the J.J. Josey Store building in order to avoid soils
impacted by the buildings drip-line.

J.J. Josey Store Perimeter
A total of 13 small-scale test units and
one shovel test unit were excavated around the
perimeter of the J.J. Josey Store (Figure 5). Test
Units were placed approximately five to six
meters apart around the perimeter of the building.
Ideally, units were to be placed approximately 1.5
m away from the structure in order to avoid soils
impacted by the buildingâs drip-line; however,
the discovery of a previously unknown phone
line in Test Unit 8 resulted in the placement of
test units along the western side of the building
to within 0.5 m of the structure (Figure 6). All

Observations of soils, landforms, unit and
shovel test locations, and recovered cultural
material were recorded on standardized field
forms. Digital photographs were also taken of
field work.   All excavated soils were screened
through Â¼ inch mesh and artifacts recovered
were recorded by provenience. All artifacts
recovered were collected and kept for analysis
and curation. A preliminary,
descriptive analysis on these
artifacts is provided below
under Recovered Materials. A
GPS device, utilizing a UTM
coordinate system, was used to
mark the locations of all units
and shovel tests.
Artifacts
will be temporarily housed at
the Center for Archaeological
Studies, Texas State UniversitySan Marcos but will be prepared
for permanent curation at the
Texas Historical Commission
Historic Sites Division curational
facility. A site revisit form was
filed at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL)
upon completion of the field
work.

A previously unknown phone
line was encountered during the
excavation of Test Unit 8 (see
Figure 6). The phone line was
encountered at approximately 20
cmbs, in the middle of the test
unit and extended in a north to
south direction, parallel to the J.J.
Josey Store. Due to its location
in the middle of the test unit, it
was decided that the unit would
be closed and a second unit,
Test Unit 9, would be excavated
approximately 0.5 m from the
J.J. Josey Store.

Figure 6. Phone line in Test Unit 8.

A
second
previously
unknown phone line was then
encountered in Test Unit 9 at approximately 40
cmbs (Figure 8). This phone line also extended
in a north to south direction, parallel to the J.J.
Josey Store. As the phone line was encountered
in the western wall of Test Unit 9, excavations
continued, cutting around the phone line to a depth
of 95 cmbs. A third phone line was encountered
at approximately 30 cmbs during excavations of

test units were square, measuring 30 cm across,
and were excavated in 10 cm arbitrary levels to a
depth of no more than one meter. A single shovel
test unit, Shovel Test 14, was also excavated on
the northern side of the structure in association
with a proposed interpretive sign.
A buried water pipe line was encountered
in the southwest corner of Test Unit 6 at
approximately 18 cmbs (Figure 7). The pipe was
previously identified by ground
penetrating radar (GPR) survey
prior to the current investigation
and its eventual discovery was
anticipated (Bryan McAuley
personal communication 2010).
The pipe was approximately 5
cm in diameter and extended in a
northwest to southeast direction.
It was inferred from its direction
that the pipe extended underneath
the J.J. Josey Store. Excavations
in Test Unit 6 continued, cutting
around the exposed pipe, to a
depth of 90 cmbs.

70.7 gram of mortar and 770.7
grams of brick fragments were
collected from excavation units
around the J.J. Josey Store. These
materials and those recovered
from the shovel test excavations
are briefly described below under
Recovered Materials.
An examination of the
amounts of
architectural
and household artifacts was
conducted with the prospect of
identifying possible locations of
structures and activity areas. In
general, high concentrations of
architectural remains would be
indicative of structural remains,
while high concentration of household artifacts
would suggest the location of domestic activities.
Architectural artifacts considered include brick,
nails, flat (window) glass, mortar, and clay daub.
While historical accounts of the construction of
structures that were once located at San Felipe
de Austin do not describe any wattle and daub
structures, clay was used to chink the spaces
between logs in the construction of hand-hewn
log cabins prior to the civil war in Texas (Jones
2005). Household artifacts representing food
preparation, consumption, storage and/or discard
include ceramic sherds, shaped glass, and bone
fragments. Unidentifiable metal artifacts as well as
charcoal samples, plastic, and the wood fragment
were not included as they could be representative
of both household and architectural activity.

Figure 8. Photo of Unit 9 with exposed phone line.

Test Unit 12. This phone line extended in a west
to east direction, perpendicular to the J.J. Josey
Store, along the southern wall of the test unit. As
such, excavations continued, cutting around the
exposed phone line to a depth of 85 cmbs.
All units (small-scale test units and shovel
test units) excavated in the storeâs perimeter
contained cultural remains (Appendix A and B).
The majority of artifacts were recovered from
between 20 and 70 cmbs. Soils were composed
of sandy loam and remained somewhat consistent
through each level of excavation, becoming
progressively wetter below 40 to 60 cmbs. Most
units were terminated between 90 and 100 cmbs
due to the presence of dense clays; however two
units (Units 9 and 10) were terminated at 95 cmbs
and 90 cmbs respectively upon encountering the
water table.

The highest concentration of brick fragments
were recovered from Test Unit 10, Shovel Test 14,
and Test Unit 3, while the highest concentration
of window glass and metal nails was recovered
from Test Units 12 and 13 (Table 1). While a high
concentration of architectural materials in this
area would most likely represents a structure or

structures that once stood upon Lots 13 and 14, the
amount of architectural artifacts recovered from
the above listed Test Units were not of sufficient
amount to support this contention. Historical
documentation (Bradfield 1967; Bradfield and
Henson 1970) however, indicates that Stephen
F. Austinâs first home followed by the Whiteside
Hotel and then the Jones Hotel were once located
on these lots.

interpretive signs that will present information
about the San Felipe de Austin State Historic Site
to visitors. Prior to excavations, the locations of
the proposed signs were marked on the ground by
THC personnel. A single shovel test unit was then
excavated in each of these locations. Shovel test
units measured a minimum of 30 cm in diameter
and were excavated to a depth of 50 cm below
surface level.

The greatest amount of household artifacts
was also located in Test Units 12 and 13
correlating with the highest concentration of
window glass and nails (Table 2). While this
might suggests that the structures once located in
this area housed domestic activities, Test Unit 12
is considered to be disturbed due to the location
of phone line along its southern wall. It is also
impossible to discern from the small amounts of
collected artifacts if structures housing domestic
activities once stood in this location.

Twenty-one ceramic sherds, 6 shards of
glass, 12 metal pieces, one piece of bone, and
339.6 grams of brick fragments were recovered
from shovel test units. Collected material remains
are briefly discussed below under Recovered
Materials. Only three shovel test units, Shovel
Test 14, 15, and 16 contained cultural materials
(Appendix B). No materials were encountered or
collected from Shovel Test 17 and 18. Artifacts
were recovered from all levels and soils consisting
of sandy loam remained consistent throughout
excavations.

Interpretive Sign Shovel Tests

An examination of architectural and
household artifact amounts was also conducted on
the recovered materials from shovel tests (Tables
3 and 4). Shovel Test 15 contained the greatest

earthenware, pearlware, stoneware, majolica,
and unknown. The majority of recovered
ceramic sherds (n=21) consisted of undecorated
white earthenwares (Figure 10: d, e, f). White
earthenwares are characterized by white to offwhite colored, thin, hard, compact paste with
a clear lead glaze. Blue tints were often added
to the glaze to produce a similar appearance
to pearlwares. Vessel forms include bowls,
cups, plates, platters, and teapots. This ceramic
classification was manufactured after 1830
(Miller 1991).

displays brown colored banding, it can be dated
to prior to 1840.
One rim sherd of a pearlware, edged variety
was recovered from Test Unit 3 (Figure 10: b).
This ceramic type was produced in England
between 1785 and 1840. The recovered rim sherd
type is described by Miller (1987) as scalloped
rim, impressed âbudâ design, produced between
1813 and 1834. Shell edge decorations were
common on creamwares, pearlwares, and other
white earthenwares between the late eighteenth
and mid-nineteenth centuries (Noel Hume 1969).

One sherd of banded annular ware (Figure
10: a) was recovered from Shovel Test 15. This
ceramic type can be roughly dated to between
1785 and 1840 and was produced in both
the United States and England. This banded
pattern, known as âannular decorationâ can be
found on creamwares between 1785 and 1815,
on pearlwares between 1790 and 1820, and on
whitewares between 1830 and 1900. After 1840,
annular ware becomes only available in a blue
band variety (Noel Hume 1969). As this sherd

A total of five sherds displaying transfer print
decorations were collected from Shovel Tests 15
and 16 during investigations. Three sherds are
pearlware, transfer printed, brown (Figure 10: c),
and two sherds are white earthenware, transfer
printed, red. Line engraved transfer printed
wares that display heavier cruder designs and a
minimum of shading can be dated to between
1780 and 1807. By 1807 stippling was introduced
in which many small dots were used to produce
more precise designs that displayed shading and
dimensionality. Motifs prior
to 1815 were predominately
Chinese-inspired and between
1815 and 1830 landscape and
historical themes increased in
popularity. Romantic themes
became predominate after 1830.
Blue was used between 1784
and 1840, while brown was
introduced after 1809. Navy blue
was also used between 1818 and
1830. Red, green, and purple
colors were not introduced until
1829. The dates of these colors
can also be applied to white
earthenware transfer printed
ceramics. Based on these date
ranges, the three brown color

aquamarine, solarized, and clear). All of the
shaped glass, with the exception of one bottle
neck, were unidentifiable as to vessel shape/
function. The single fragment of a bottle neck was
composed of solarized glass; however, it lacks
additional attributes that could narrow down
its manufacturing date. Generally speaking,
solarized, or purple glass, can be dated to between
1880 and 1915. During this time manganese was
added to glass mixtures in order to produce a
colorless, clear glass. Exposure of manganese
glass to the sun over time resulted in the glass
acquiring a purple hue (Munsey 1970:55).

A single Albany slipped stoneware sherd
was collected from Test Unit 2. Stonewares
were most often utilitarian wares such as jugs,
crocks, churns, pitchers, inkwells, and oil lamps.
This ceramic class was manufactured in North
America by the beginning of the eighteenth
century and still continues to be made under
limited production (Greer 1981). Albany slip is
a hard, chocolate brown glaze that is produced
from natural clays. The vessel is dipped into a
watery slurry mix during the manufacturing
process. The glaze is applied to either the interior
or exterior only or to both. The collected sherd
displays an exterior glaze. While the original
clay used in the manufacturing of Albany slipped
stonewares was extracted from a location near
Albany, New York, it became widely produced
by 1825, but was less common by 1910 (Zimler
1987).

Metal
Collected
metal artifacts were further
classified as nail, screw, coil, flat, or unknown.
Identifiable nails were further divided into square,
and wire. Square nails can be further type classified
into hand-wrought and machine-cut. A total of 44
square nails (75 % of the identifiable nails) were
collected during investigations. It was impossible
to fully determine whether the collected square
nails were machine-made or hand-wrought due to
advance stages of decomposition. Hand-wrought
nails were generally in use throughout the
sixteenth, seventeenth, and most of the eighteenth
century, but were still utilized in the nineteenth
century (Noel Hume 1969:252-254). Handwrought nails were common in the United States
until the 1880s, when square-cut machine-made
nails, which were introduced in 1830, became
more popular (Nelson 1968). By the 1850s, roundwire nails were being manufactured in New York
(Noel Hume 1969:252-254); however, they did not
become popular until the 1890s. Based on these
date ranges, the collected square nails can be
roughly dated to between 1600 and 1880, while
the wire nails are of more recent manufacture
and can be dated from the 1850s to the present.

Two small majolica sherds were collected
from Test Unit 13 and Shovel Test 14. Majolica is
a tin-glazed earthenware that was manufactured
in New Spain from the sixteenth to nineteenth
century. Colors used in manufacture include
cobalt blue, antimony yellow, iron red, copper
green and manganese purple. The two small
sherds collected contain cobalt blue coloring.
The most common shape of majolica pottery was
a display dish. The collect sherds are too small
to determine actual vessel shape or majolica
type classification, but can be roughly dated to
between 1790 and 1830.

Glass
Collected glass shards were divided into
flat (window glass) and shaped (vessel glass).
Shaped glass was then further divided into
color categories (i.e. amber, brown, olive, green,

river-worn debitage pieces. The
majority of the lithics were
collected from Test Unit 3. The
river-worn appearance of the
collected lithics indicates that
they do not represent an intact
prehistoric deposit, but have most
likely been deposited during a
flooding event in the prehistoric
past.

13). Pillar dollars were minted in Mexico City
between 1732 and 1771, when they were replaced
by a milled bust variety. The pillar dollar
was enormously popular and was circulated
throughout the world, serving as legal tender in the
United Sates until 1857. These coins were never
minted in Spain, instead only manufactured at
Spanish colonial mints in the New World. Mexico
City milled pillar coins are distinguishable by a
mintmark of an M with a small O above (New
World Treasures 2009). The recovered section
displays an M with a small O above it indicating

that this coin was minted in Mexico City. The
American dollar was based on the Spanish pillar
dollar and some of the slang expressions that refer
to the 8 reales still survive. As an example, the 8
reales was often cut into 8 âbitsâ, as the collected
piece demonstrates, to make change. Each bit
was worth 12.5 cents. Though somewhat less
familiar now, the expression â2 bitsâ still refers
to a quarter dollar.

Summary and
Recommendations

Archaeological deposits associated with the
occupation of San Felipe de Austin between 1823
and 1836 were noted and recovered from the
small-scale test unit investigations around the J.J.
Josey Store. While artifacts were recovered down
to a depth of 90 cmbs, the majority of recovered
artifacts were concentrated between 50 and 60
cmbs. The greatest amount of both architectural
and household artifacts were collected from the
western side of the J.J. Josey Store. No features
were encountered or identified during test unit
excavations. Impacts from the modifications to the
western side of the J.J. Josey Store are anticipated
to be minimal and include the replacement of
support piers with shallow surface impacts. The
installation of restroom facilities on the rear or
southern side of the J.J. Josey Store is anticipated
to be of greater impact, approximately 1 m (3 ft
below surface). While cultural materials were
recovered from the small-scale test units, the
presence of a waterline, phone line and the low
volume of collected artifacts indicate that there
exists a low potential for intact, significant cultural
remains in this area. As such, CAS recommends
that the proposed modifications should proceed,
while monitored by a professional archaeologist
in order to document additional encountered
cultural remains. As such, CAS requests cultural
resource clearance for this project.

CAS archaeologists excavated a total of 13
small-scale test units and 5 shovel test units in
advance of proposed improvements at the San
Felipe de Austin State Historic Site. Small-scale
test units were excavated around the J.J. Josey
Store, proposed to be modified into a temporary
visitors center, while shovel test units were
excavated in locations of proposed interpretive
sign locations. Three of the shovel test units
were positive for cultural remains (ST 14, 15, and
16). Artifacts collected from these shovel test
units included brick fragments, ceramic sherds,
metal, bone and glass. The amounts collected
were insufficient to support the contention that
structures and/or domestic activities were once
located in these locations. No features were
encountered or identified by shovel test unit
excavations. CAS concludes that no significant  
historic cultural resources will be impacted by the
installation of the proposed interpretive signs. As
such, CAS does not recommend any additional
investigations in association with the installation
of the interpretive signs.
