ABSTRACT
The cities of Fort Worth and Burleson are proposing to construct an
extension of Abner Lee Drive from south of Spinks Airport to N. Burleson
Boulevard along the Tarrant and Johnson county line in Burleson, Texas.
The project route is approximately 2600 feet long and will consist of a
100-foot wide right-of-way. An archaeological survey was conducted to
determine if any cultural resources were present, and if so, how they might
be impacted by construction. No prehistoric or historic sites were
encountered during the survey, despite the excavation of eight shovel tests.
Based upon the absence of cultural materials and the existing
modifications and previous disturbances within the study area, ARC
recommends that further cultural resource investigations of the Abner Lee
Drive Extension route are unwarranted. However, if cultural materials are
encountered during construction, work in the area should halt immediately
and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should
be contacted to assess the significance of the discovery before work
proceeds.

INTRODUCTION
The cities of Fort Worth and Burleson are proposing to construct an extension of Abner
Lee Drive from south of Spinks Airport to N. Burleson Boulevard along the Tarrant and
Johnson county line in Burleson, Texas (Figure 1). The project route is approximately
2600 feet long and will consist of a 100-foot wide right-of-way. The cities have
contracted with Freese & Nichols, Inc. (FNI) for the engineering and environmental
permitting. FNI has contracted AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct the intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed route. The Texas Historical
Commission (THC) has already reviewed two letters sent from FNI about the project and
have stated that only this portion of the project needs survey. The deepest anticipated
impacts for the project are 1 to 2 feet deep. The route crosses North Creek an intermittent
tributary of Village Creek.
The purpose of the archaeological survey was to determine if cultural materials older than
50 years are present, and, if so, make recommendations about their significance and how
they will be impacted by construction. The cultural resource investigation was conducted
during January of 2011 and was required because the cities of Fort Worth and Burleson
are political entities of the State of Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5867 was
issued for the survey. Since North Creek contains Waters of the United States, it falls
within the jurisdiction of the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE). Relevant federal legislation includes the National Historic Preservation Policy
Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Act of 1969 (PL-90190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93291), the Clean Water Act, as amended PL-92-500 and the Rivers and Harbors Act of
1899. The Archeology Division of the THC not only will review this report as the State
Agency, but also as the Section 106 review agency.
This report is written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the
Archeology Division of the THC, and developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists
(n.d.). The following report presents a brief description of the natural setting of the
project area, followed by a discussion of the cultural history of North Central Texas. A
chapter on the research design and methodology employed in the investigation is then
followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes with
recommendations followed by the references cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The proposed route is situated on the border between Tarrant and Johnson counties in
North Central Texas. This portion of the counties consists of rolling terrain with
undulating hills. The route crosses two geological formations, the first being the
Holocene-aged alluvium which has accumulated in the Village Creek floodplain (Bureau
of Economic Geology 1972). However, this alluvium only underlies a small portion of
the eastern terminus, which is an already paved part of Abner Lee Drive, just south of
Spinks Airport. Lower Cretaceous-aged Grayson Marl and Main Street Limestone, which
is composed of fine-grained clay and marl and weathers into gentle slopes; underlie the
majority of the route.
Soils within the project area are Frio silty clay, occasionally flooded, Ponder clay loam
and Sanger clay (Ressel 1981: Sheet 63; Coburn 1985: Sheet 4). Ponder clay loam and
Sanger clay are upland soils found on slopes. Ponder clay loam has no described Chorizon, but Sanger clay is described as being 70 to 80 inches below the surface. Frio
silty clay is floodplain sediment that has a described C-horizon around 60 inches below
the surface.
This study area is located near the ecotone between the Fort Worth Prairie and Eastern
Cross Timbers physiographic provinces (Dyksterhuis 1946: Figure 1). The Fort Worth
Prairie is dominated by medium tall dense grassland composed primarily of Little
Bluestem and Texas needle grass. Medium tall grasses interspersed with broadleaf
deciduous trees, primarily blackjack and post oak, which are scattered singly or in
extensive groves characterize the Cross Timbers. The woodlands provide natural cover
for fauna, and plant resources. Tributaries such as Village Creek drain the sandy loams in
the Eastern Cross Timbers and flow north into the West Fork of the Trinity River.
Streams in the Fort Worth Prairie drain into the upper tributaries of the Clear Fork of the
Trinity River (Dyksterhuis 1946: Figure 1). North Creek, which the route crosses, show
as having been channelized on the 1981 photorevised USGS 7.5’ Burleson quad (Figure
2).

Modern fauna are varied and abundant with at least 49 species of mammals, 39 species of
snakes, 17 species of reptiles and other species (Blair 1950:101–102). Common forms of
fauna include deer, raccoon, opossum, rabbit, lizards and turtles. Armadillos have
invaded the area within the past 50 years. Various authors, including Lynott (1979),
believed that the prairie was inhabited by now extinct bison and antelope.
Fields of Uvalde Gravel (Byrd 1971) have been recorded in upland settings between the
valleys of the Elm Fork and West Fork on upland divides (Menzer and Slaughter
1971:217). Mapped locations of previously recorded beds of Ogallala gravels are on
upland divides to the north, south and east of the study area (McGregor 1995:Figure 4).
These gravels are likely an eastward extension of Ogallala gravels (Banks 1990:56) and
similar gravel fields may be present in the study area, although not shown by McGregor.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Over the past several decades, cultural resources investigations in North Central Texas
have varied due to the locations and types of projects being carried out. The following
culture history is derived from the monograph Lower Elm Fork Prehistory by Daniel J.
Prikryl (1990). Prikryl's framework includes the six prehistoric periods, to which the
historic Native American and European periods have been added.
Using Prikryl’s time framework, the following paragraphs present a brief description of
the culture history of the region.
Historic European
Historic Native American

Middle Archaic
Early Archaic

ca. 11,000 B.C. to 6,000 B.C.

Prehistoric occupation within North Central Texas dates is identified in the
archaeological record by distinctive spear points such as Clovis, Dalton and Plainview.
These types of artifacts have been recovered from deeply buried floodplain deposits
along the Upper Elm Fork of the Trinity River in North Central Texas (Crook and Harris
1957; Ferring 2001). Daniel Prikryl reported that in the Lower Elm Fork area most of the
Paleoindian sites are located on the terraces above the floodplain (1990:19).
During the Early Archaic, the general drying continued, and sites are found on stream
terraces. There is a hint of population increase, and Lynott (1981:103) suggests that there
was increased emphasis on the use of bottomland food resources. Prikryl (1990:71)
cannot confirm Lynott's suggestion, and in fact, he reports fewer bottomland sites than
during the previous period. Middle Archaic sites are predominantly found on the first
terrace above stream floodplains. As earlier, sites tend to be along the Elm Fork rather
than along the smaller tributaries. It appears that population density continued to be low.
Late Archaic sites increase in number over the previous period, and sites are located both
along the rivers and along tributaries. There appears to be a strong shift in site location to
the tributary streams and a pronounced population explosion. Local Ogallala quartzite is
being used prominently at this time, and some authors take this observation as evidence
of increased territorial restrictions (Prikryl 1990).
During the Late Prehistoric I period, the bow and arrow and pottery appear in artifact
assemblages. Houses and probable evidence of agriculture first appear during this period,
although none are known in the immediate area. Site locations mirror those of the Late
Archaic, and quartzite continued as the common material used for chipped stone

projectiles and tools. The West Fork Paleosol is dated to this period, and drying
continued into the subsequent period (Peter and McGregor 1988; Ferring 1990).
The Late Prehistoric II is highlighted by the prominence of buffalo in archaeological sites
and the appearance of tools normally expected to occur at sites on the High Plains of
West Texas. It also appears that sites are once again located on sandy terraces above the
floodplains (Peter and McGregor 1988).
Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, according to some historical
documents, the aboriginal inhabitants of North Central Texas continued to play a role in
the history of that region. Very little archaeological evidence, however, of historic Native
American occupation has been found in the area. This is a pattern seen throughout much
of Texas, and one, which has been suggested, is due to the inability of the Native
Americans to adapt to the changing climate (Skinner 1988). The 1830s and 1840s were
decades of Anglo expansion into North Central Texas. Garrett (1972:24), a wellrespected Fort Worth historian, has stated that "Indian hostilities almost depopulated
North Texas [of Anglo settlers] after 1839. It dwindled to less than half. According to
tradition, many Indians of several tribes roamed the region until well into the 1860s.
The earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around
1840, and Lonesome Dove, settled in 1845. Lonesome Dove, located near present-day
Grapevine, was the first permanent settlement in Tarrant County (Garrett 1972:55). The
county itself was organized in 1850, but it was not until 1860 that Fort Worth was
officially named the county seat, that designation having been transferred from Birdville
(Webb 1952:708). Settlers, however, had been steadily arriving in the county during
those 20 years. Many came through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants, although
only 160 families and single pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett 1972:57).
Settlement began in Johnson County under the auspices of Robertson’s Colony. In 1840,
the northern half of the county included the Peter’s Colony while the southern half was in
the Mercer Colony. The initial settlement of the county began in the mid-1840s. The
western half of Johnson County was taken to form Hood County and Cleburne was
chosen as the county seat. Later in 1881, a portion of Ellis County was added to Johnson
County, forming the county we know today.
The Civil War took its toll on Tarrant County's population, as most of the able-bodied
men left to fight for the Confederacy. Fort Worth's renaissance was motivated by growth
of the cattle industry and the arrival of the railroad. By 1870, it is estimated that 300,000
head of cattle had been driven through Fort Worth. By the end of the nineteenth century,
Fort Worth had shed its "six-shooter" culture for a more refined cow town culture which
was beginning to use its past to advantage. Oil was the next great influence on the city of
Fort Worth. The city became the gateway to the West Texas oil fields (Knight 1990:192)
and both fed the population and served as an impetus for post-World War II industrial
development. Once again, Fort Worth became a focal point for an industry as it had for so
many decades. Fort Worth’s post-war prosperity also nurtured smaller surrounding
communities such as Forest Hill, Everman, Kennedale and Burleson, the populations of
which continue to grow as commuters settle in these small towns.

Burleson was established in 1881 when the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad
purchased the land and established a depot. In 1882, the post office was located in a
saloon. After the establishment of the post office, businesses and churches were
constructed. In 1893, the Presbyterian run Alta Vista College became Red Oak Academy.
For the first 50 years, Burleson was a stable community built around agriculture and
livestock. Electricity came to Burleson in 1913 and gas in 1921. In 1960, Burleson
became of suburb of Fort Worth and, as a result, began to rely more on industry and less
on agriculture (Maxwell 2011:1-2).
Previous Investigations
Numerous archaeological studies have been conducted around the proposed route. These
studies have generally focused on the prehistory of the Village Creek Watershed and the
West Fork of the Trinity River. During these investigations a number of archaeological
sites, both prehistoric and historic have been recorded. Studies along the West Fork of the
Trinity River have uncovered buried, stratified sites on the north and south side of the
river up to 4 meters deep (Peter 1987; Ferring 1994; Shaunessy, Jurney and Yedlowski
1994; Largent, Hunt and Peter 1994; Ferring and Byers 1996; Skinner, Caran and Trask
1999). Interestingly, multiple studies incorporating backhoe testing at the confluence of
Village Creek before it flows into the West Fork of the Trinity River and further south
have not uncovered buried cultural deposits (Andrews and Caran 1990a and b; Ferring
1988; Prikryl 1995).
During several of these investigations, sites were found in three topographic settings,
prehistoric and historic sites have been recorded on terraces and in the uplands away from
Village Creek, while historic resources such as cemeteries have been recorded near the
floodplain edge. The earliest investigations along Village Creek began with avocational
archeologist R.E. Forrester Jr., who recorded site 41TR150 on a terrace overlooking the
confluence of Village and Deer Creek (TASA 2011). The site was in a plowed sandy
field and consisted of an extensive Middle to Late Archaic lithic scatter. Employing a
survey method of “casual strolling,” Forrester located 13 dart points, 1 arrow point and 3
lithic tools between the years of 1935 and 1945. Despite its dearth of recorded sites, this
setting is still an area of very high archaeological potential. Its elevation out of the
Village Creek floodplain would have made it an ideal point for access to aquatic
resources prehistorically. Additionally, the frequently flooded floodplain, along with
erosion of the quickly draining terraces deposits above has accumulated a great deal of
well-stratified sediment deposition, increasing the potential for finding buried
archaeological resources.
The University of Texas at Arlington undertook a series of excavations on three
prehistoric sites (the Village Creek sites) between 1993 and 1999 on the upland rides and
bluffs to the east of Village Creek. The Village Creek Sites consist of 41TR134 (the Riley
site), 41TR136 (the Fountain site) and 41TR152 (the Killian site) (Maxwell 2002:4). Of
the three sites, the most extensive investigations were conducted at the Fountain site,
which is a multi-component site west of Kennedale on an upland bluff overlooking

Village Creek. The site contains well-stratified cultural deposits from the Late Archaic,
Late Prehistoric I and II, and the Historic periods (Hanson and Kvernes 1997:Figure 5).
Artifacts recovered at the Fountain site include a Gary point, numerous unidentifiable
dart points, non-diagnostic lithic tools and lithic debitage in the Late Archaic component.
From the Late Prehistoric component, diagnostic arrow points (including Alba, Bonham,
Clifton, Rockwell, Scallorn, Harrell and Perdiz points), non-diagnostic arrow points, nondiagnostic lithic tools, lithic debitage and 27 pottery sherds. Faunal remains were
recovered throughout the cultural deposit. Large mammals accounted for approximately
80 percent of the faunal remains recovered at the site, and of those the majority was
attributed to white-tail deer. Ephemeral archaeobotanical botanical remains recovered in
the Late Prehistoric site indicate possible exploitation of acorns from the region’s
surrounding blackjack and post oak forests.
Though the Late Archaic component was more extensive, artifact assemblages at the
Riley site (which sits immediately south of the Fountain site) were similar to those
recovered at the Fountain site (Hanson and Kvernes 1996). Given the abundance of
lithics, particularly projectile points, recovered at the Riley and Fountain sites, as well as
the large mammal bones, Hanson and Kvernes concluded that the two sites were most
likely specialized hunting/extraction camps that were occupied on a seasonal or perennial
basis (1996:12).
The Killian site, located approximately 1.6 miles upstream from the Riley and Fountain
sites, is likewise a multi-component site; however it contained far fewer artifacts
(Maxwell 2002:44). Primarily chert lithic debitage was recovered, as well as some
utilized flakes and a quartzite dart point (TASA 2011). Though the Killian site is situated
in a similar topographic setting as the Riley and Fountain sites, it sits almost one mile
from Village Creek on a less dramatic rise above the floodplain. Given its meager artifact
density and slightly differing setting, it is possible that the Killian site is a lithic
procurement/production site and not a seasonal hunting/extraction campsite similar to the
two Village Creek sites downstream to the north.
Tentative evidence for Historic Native American occupation also exists in the uplands
east of Village Creek. In a 1995 survey report for the Village Creek Pipeline Interceptor
pipeline, Prikryl spoke with local informants that reported a Native American burial in on
a bluff east of Village Creek (Prikryl 1995:1). However, this was not confirmed during
the survey. On the west side of the creek, Prikryl also noted reports from avocational
archeologist that had recorded a historic burial in the sand and gravel pits west of the
creek. Despite shovel testing and backhoe trenching in high probability areas, no
archaeological sites were identified during the investigation.
Cultural resource investigations less than 3 miles of the proposed route are discussed in
detail below. In 2004, AR Consultants, Inc. surveyed 265 acres the southwest for the
Wakefield Development site (Todd, Trask, Skinner and Wheeler 2004). One historic site
was recorded during the survey. Site 41JN50 consists of historic house complex, barns
and silos. Further research into the silo, allowed the researchers to discover that it came
from a do-it-yourself wooden silo kit, dated to the early to mid 20th century, and was

similar to ones built in North Central United States (Skinner and van Oeveren 2007). The
silo was octagonal in shape and had collapsed. Additionally, a concrete and rock-lined
bell-shaped silo was identified and the site was once a dairy. The site is situated on an
upland ridge overlooking an intermittent tributary of Village Creek. Due to the poor
integrity of the site and structures, it was not eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places(NRHP) (Todd et al. 2004).
Just south of the study area, ARC conducted a linear study for the Burleson Bicycle
Trails (Todd 2005). The 2.8-mile bike trail paralleled Village Creek for a part of the route
and was adjacent to the Burleson Cemetery. No cultural resources were identified during
the study. Approximately two miles south of the route, Prewitt & Associates, Inc.
surveyed the 3.9km route for Hidden Creek Parkway (McWilliams 2005). One site was
recorded, 41JN49, which consisted of a historic farmstead with a well on an upland ridge
above Quil Miller Creek, a perennial tributary of Village Creek. The site was not eligible
for inclusion on the NRHP. Additionally, ARC surveyed a 2.6-mile long route for a
sewer line approximately one mile south of the study area (Todd 2006). The route
paralleled Village Creek for most of the route and no archeological sites were identified.
In 2008, ARC conducted a small study of a half a mile long pipeline along Quil Miller
Creek and no cultural resources were identified in the survey (Craver 2008).
A records review also notes only six historic resources are recorded within a 3-mile
radius of the route, one of which is the previously discussed 41JN49. Approximately one
mile to the northeast is the Tye Memorial Cemetery, half a mile to the east is the Hudson
Family Plot and one mile south is the Burleson Cemetery (TASA 2011). The Hudson
Family Plot is a small, rural family cemetery that dates between the 1860s and 1900. The
Tye Memorial Cemetery dates between 1860s and 1970s and the Burleson Cemetery was
opened in 1909 and is still in operation today. According to TASA (2011), three quarters
of a mile to the southeast is site 41JN62, a historic home site recorded by PBS&J on an
upland ridge above Village Creek. The site dates to the early 20th century and was not
eligible for the NRHP. Two miles north of the route, Blanton & Associates, Inc. recorded
a portion of the electric rail system berm as 41TR238. The small portion of the berm will
be destroyed by the project and it was determined not to be eligible for the NRHP. A
review of historic maps of Tarrant County, including the 1893 Sam’s Street map of
Tarrant County and the 1920 Tarrant County Soils map indicate the presence of
structures along Village Creek and historic roads, but none in the immediate vicinity of
the study area. The 1958 Johnson County Highway map shows no structures in the study
area.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Previous investigations within the Village Creek Watershed have recorded a variety of
historic and prehistoric cultural resources. Results from these findings combined with a
review of the environmental setting of the route provide data for assessing the
archaeological potential of the route. Village Creek is on an ecotone between the Fort
Worth Prairie and Eastern Cross Timbers. Ecotone environments are settings that provide
a diversity of natural resources. Given the close proximity of the North Creek’s
confluence with Village Creek, the area had potential for archaeology.
Although previous investigations show that the majority of sites recorded in the area are
concentrated along Village Creek, prehistoric sites are known to exist in an
environmental setting similar to that of the proposed route. Upland sites are usually
recorded near or around freshwater drainages or on knolls above these drainages. The
presence of both elements in and near the study area indicates that there is potential to
find prehistoric archaeological sites. Due to the size of the water drainage, sites are
expected to be temporary hunting camps and would consist of artifact or lithic scatters.
Historic site potential is high within the Village Creek Watershed, as the remnants of
historic settlements and 19th century cemeteries are present. In the Fort Worth Prairie,
historic sites are located within the uplands several hundred feet of historic transportation
routes. In the Eastern Cross Timbers, historic homesteads and farmsteads can be found on
high points of the landscape, away from transportation routes. Archival research of
historic maps and cemetery records demonstrates that the region surrounding the project
area was occupied since the 1870s. Evidence for historic sites along North Creek might
include trash concentrations, while the remains of foundations or outbuildings associated
with farmsteads may be present in the area overlooking the creek or near transportation
routes; however none have been plotted on any of the historic maps reviewed.
Overall, despite the potential for prehistoric and historic sites within the study area, this
should be tempered with the fact that extensive land modification the study area has
occurred in the 20th century in the form of reinforcement of the banks to minimize
erosion, farming, ranching, and the installation of utilities. In addition, avocational
archeologists have been collecting in the area since the 1940s. These factors do not affect
the potential for finding sites in the area, but they may have been impacted both historic
and prehistoric cultural resources.
Methodology
The surveyor walked parallel transects spaced 20 meters apart and made notes about the
ground exposure, surface artifacts, soil types and disturbed areas where subsoil was
exposed. Photographs were taken along the route using Fuji FinePix J38 12.2 mega pixel

digital camera. Shovel tests were excavated on average every 100 meters, which is
recommended by the THC (n.d.). Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter and the clay
soils were inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine if
cultural materials were present. Shovel tests were described on the basis of texture and
color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to identify the specific soil colors in each
test. The shovel tests were determined with a handheld Garmin Colorado 400t GPS unit.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into two sections with the description of the study area followed
by the survey results. Shovel tests are described briefly within the text, but are described
in detail in Table 1. Conclusions end the chapter.
Study Area
The route’s western terminus begins at the end of a short street near a concrete plant and
other industrial businesses. The route continues east through an abandoned field, that at
one time had been cleared of vegetation and presumably was farmed. The majority of the
route west of North Creek consists of knee- to waist-high prairie grasses, although some
young invasive scrub brush, like mesquites and junipers are beginning to invade (Figure
3). As the route continues east, it is bisected by a natural gas pipeline and a distribution
line and two large transmission lines before reaching the channelized creek (Figures 4
and 5). Within the ROW for these utilities, is the only place gravels were noted on the
surface. All of the gravels were imported limestone gravels used for construction. The
route then reaches North Creek, which now is 5 to 8 meters wide and 1 to 2 meters deep
and carrying approximately 50 to 75 cm of water, which is presumably runoff from the
surrounding area (Figure 6). The creek was lined with a few older hackberries and oaks
and an abundance of green briar and the channel contained very tall cattails. The east
bank of the creek had a larger area of invasive scrub brush before reaching an artificial
slope that was built up by Spinks Airport and is a well maintained part of the flight path
(Figure 4 and 7).

Survey Results
Survey began at the western end and proceeded east towards Spinks Airport. Eight shovel
tests were excavated along the route, all of which were negative for cultural materials
(Figure 8). Shovel tests (ST) 1 through 3 were located in the small abandoned field west
of the utility corridor. The three shovel tests had consistent soil horizons, with black and
very dark gray clays and sandy clays on top of grayish brown clay with CaCO3 nodules.
ST4 was excavated between the gas pipeline and transmission line and the other two
transmission lines and was consistent with the first three, with the exception of limestone
gravels being on the surface. ST5 was excavated approximately 10 meters from the west
bank. This shovel test encountered 8 horizons, the top 6 of which were disturbed and fill,
presumably from the channelization of the creek. The bottom 2 horizons were stable
clays; the bottom clay was similar to the bottom horizons of the first four shovel tests.
ST6 was excavated on the east bank of North Creek approximately 5 meters and
contained a very similar profile to ST5 demonstrating disturbance and fill material. ST7
was excavated in the sparsely wooded area and contained stable sediments similar to the
first four. ST8 was excavated at the top of the artificial slope and contained 65 cm of
mottled clay with gravels demonstrating that it is fill material.

Conclusions
No prehistoric or historic cultural resources were encountered during the survey. The
research design stated that study area could possibly contain ephemeral remains of
temporary hunting or camping sites located near North Creek. However, if the area was
used for hunting or gathering activities, no evidence was found. No evidence of
prehistoric occupation was found anywhere on the surface in the study area or buried in
the sediments. The lack of buried prehistoric site deposits is attributed to the upland
setting. If prehistoric scatters once existed within the project area, it is conceivable that
erosion processes and/or historic disturbances have destroyed them.
Finally, the absence of historic artifact scatters or other historic cultural resources is
attributed to two factors. The study corridor is situated a low area along North Creek, and
would have not been ideal location for a structure due to its propensity to hold water
during flooding events. In addition, the urbanization and development of the area
adjacent to the route would have most likely removed trash scatters or cultural material
associated with farming in the area.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the negative results of the survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that
further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted and that the Cities of Fort Worth
and Burleson should be allowed to proceed with the project. However, if cultural
materials are encountered during construction, work in the area should halt immediately
and the Archeology Division of the THC should be contacted to assess the significance of
the discovery before work proceeds. Work should not continue until discussions have
been concluded.
