ADDITIONAL ARCHEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE PROPOSED
GABRIEL SUBSTATION SITE, WILLIAMSON COUNTY, TEXAS
A 2 mile long, 100 ft. wide transmission corridor
connecting the Gabriel substation to two existing power
lines in Williamson County was surveyed for cultural resources
by sta
members of the Texas Archeological Survey, The
University of Texas at Austin for the Lower Colorado River
Authority (Fig. 1). Segments of this corridor were
surveyed on July 23, August 7 and December 10, 1980 as
access to the land was acquired. In 1979, the Gabriel
substation site was surveyed by TAS (Kleinschmidt 1979)
and three prehistoric sites were recorded. No sites
were located during the survey of the transmission corridor.
The Gabriel to Georgetown transmission line corridor
runs northwest from the Gabriel substation for 2600 ft.
to an intersection with an existing BEPCI transmission
line. The corridor traverses terrain with elevations of
700-710 ft. MSL and at two points crosses the Pecan Branch
tributary which flows east and southeast to the San Gabriel
River. In this section of the corridor, ground cover
consists of grasses, weeds and prickly pear with interspersed
shrubs of live oak, mesquite and cedar. The cultivated fields
were planted in milo. Soils were calcareous calys with
noticeable shrink swell cracks.
The Gabriel to TPL split extends southeast from the
substation for 1.5 miles to connect with rul existing TP&L
transmission line. The corridor traverses terrain with
elevations ranging from 680-700 ft. MSL and crosses the
Pecan Branch tributary at one point. This segment of the
corridor lies within the San Gabriel River basin. Here
vegetation includes grasses and weeds north of FM2606 and
deeply plowed fields planted in milo south of the road.
The survey was carried out by means of serpentine
transects along the right-of-way. Ground visibility ranged
from poor to moderate in areas covered with grass and weeds
to excellent in plowed and cultivated fields .

Numerous concentrations of complete and battered cobbles
of Georgetown chert were dispersed along both corridors.
Flakes found in association with these cobbles were the
result of plowing fractures and were not artifacts. Isolated
finds of cultural material were recorded at three localities
(Fig. 1). The
rst is an isolated chert projectile point
of the Bulverde type (5,000-2,600 B.P.), the second consists
of a few primary and secondary chert flakes, and the third
is a bifacially worked, roughly elliptical core tool and a
ake. No additional cultural
bifacially modified secondary
material was found in association with these isolated finds.
No archeological sites were located in the transmission
corridor. No historic structures or features were noted
in the survey area. Land use practices are such that if
prehistoric deposits were present, they are probably now
highly disturbed. The construction of a transmission line
through this corridor poses no threat to identified cultural
resources. However, in the event buried prehistoric deposits
are brought to light during the construction of this line,
the Texas Historical Commission should be notified immediately.
