ABSTRACT
On behalf of SAWS, Raba-Kistner Consultants, Inc. (R-K) performed an intensive cultural
resources survey for the proposed installation of 24-inch water main along Cross Mountain Trail
in northwestern Bexar County, Texas. The intensive survey was conducted to ensure
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas. Work was performed under Antiquities Permit
No. 5599.
Results of the historic and archival background study that a total of eight sites have been
recorded within a one mile radius of the project site. There appeared to be at least a moderate
probability of cultural resources being present within the project site based on the number of
sites previously recorded within the area.
The intensive survey of the Area of Potential Effect (APE) entailed visual inspection of the
ground surface coupled with shovel testing. Previous construction impacts and land use
modifications have severely compromised both surface and subsurface integrity of soil deposits
throughout most of the project area. A total of ten shovel tests were excavated and four profile
cuts were scraped and examined for cultural materials. One of the shovel tests produced a
lithic (chert) core and another crude lithic core was observed on the ground surface at the
easternmost half of the proposed water main route. No additional cultural materials, artifacts, or
features were identified on the surface, in the cleaned profile cuts, or in the nine remaining
shovel tests.
Given the extent of disturbances within the APE and the paucity of cultural materials identified
during the survey, it is highly unlikely that the proposed construction of the water main will
encounter or impact intact and significant archeological deposits, if any, in this disturbed setting.
No additional archeological work is recommended and the recommendations state that the
proposed project may proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION

The San Antonio Water System (SAWS) contracted with Raba-Kistner Consultants, Inc. (R-K)
to perform an intensive cultural resources survey for the proposed construction of 24-inch water
main along Cross Mountain Trail in northwestern Bexar County, Texas. Due to the moderate to
high probability of encountering cultural materials, R-K recommended a linear survey of the
proposed alignment to ensure compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas. The purpose of the
investigation was to determine if any archeological sites are located within the APE, and if sites
are present, determine their potential eligibility for designation as State Archeological Landmarks
(SALs) or for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The project limits begin at Scenic Loop Road and extend along Cross Mountain Trail for 6,100
feet to the east. Figure 1 provides a map of the project area plotted on the Van Raub, Texas
(2998-313), 7.5 minute United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle.
Figure 2 provides a map of the project area plotted on the 2009 aerial photo.
The proposed construction impacts are limited to the north side of the existing 60 foot right-of-way
(ROW) of Cross Mountain Trail. No new ROW will be required for the project. Since the survey
area is within the existing public ROW, no right-of-entry was necessary. The ROW is owned by
Bexar County.
The archeological area of potential effects (APE) subject to survey was defined as 6,100 linear
feet along the north side of Cross Mountain Trail. The estimate of project depth was based on
typical construction practices, while project length and width was based on information available
at the time of the permit application. An estimate of depth of the project ranges from six to 11
feet. The width of the survey corridor is limited to the width of the north side of the existing 60-foot
right-of-way (ROW) measured approximately 30 feet from the centerline to the edge of the
northern ROW line.
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival background review, an 100 percent
pedestrian survey of the project area supplemented with shovel testing, and a report suitable for
review by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) in accordance with the THCâs Rules of Practice
and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologistsâ (CTA)
Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Pollyanna Held, Principal Investigator
and Bruce Darnell, Archaeologist, performed the intensive survey on April 29, 2010 under
Antiquities Permit No. 5599.
The results of the background study determined that while no previously recorded sites are
located within the APE, a total of eight sites have been recorded within a one-mile radius of the
project area (THC 2010). The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects. When assessed in regard to overall
acreage, a total of 19 shovel tests would have been required for the 1.2 mile long survey. Due to
the disturbed nature of much of the project APE, in addition to the generally good ground surface
visibility (>30%), 19 shovel tests were not necessary. Instead, R-K archaeologists placed a total
of 10 shovel tests and cleaned and observed four profile cuts within the APE.
The survey resulted in the discovery of two cultural materials - Shovel Test 8 produced a lithic
(chert) core and a crude lithic core was observed on the ground surface within APE. The lithic
cores are interpreted as isolated finds based on the paucity of lithic debitage and other artifacts
within the vicinity of the positive shovel test and surface find. Moreover, no additional cultural
materials, artifacts, or features were identified in any of remaining shovel tests, profile cuts, or on

the ground surface. Based on the paucity of observed and recovered cultural materials, it is
unlikely that any significant cultural resources will be impacted by the proposed water main
project. R-K recommends that proposed construction proceed as planned. No additional work is
recommended.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

A.

Project Area Setting

The project limits begin at Scenic Loop Road and extend along Cross Mountain Trail for 6,100
feet (1.2 miles) to the east in northwestern Bexar County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2).
B.

Flora and Fauna

Flora
The project area is located in the Edwards Plateau Vegetation Area, which is predominantly
rangeland (Gould 1975). The rough rocky areas typically support a tall or mid-grass understory
and a brush overstory complex made up of live oak (Quercus virginiana), shin oak (Quercus
havardi), ash juniper (Juniperous ashi), and mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). According to the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Departmentâs map of The Vegetation Types of Texas, the project area is
within the Live Oak â Ashe Juniper Woods (27), which supports those plants listed above, as well
as, cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), evergreen sumac (Rhus sempervirens), saw greenbriar (Smilax
bona-nox), poison oak (Rhus toxicodendron), twistleaf yucca (Yucca rupicola), and various
grasses.
Fauna
The project area is located within the Balconian Biotic Provinces of Texas (Blair 1950). The
Balconian Province only exists in central Texas and is contained within the Edwards Plateau
geographic province (Neck 1986). Some of the common mammals within the area include ninebanded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), eastern
cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus flordanusi), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), opossum
(Didelphis virginianus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), and white footed mouse (Peromycus leucopus).
Blair (1950) lists at least 75 species of reptiles and amphibians found within the Balconian Biotic
Province. Also, the bird species composition in the project area is fairly diverse with numerous
breeding, migrant, and wintering species present (Smith and Beuchner 1947).
C.

Geology and Soils

Geology
According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas, San Antonio Sheet (1983), the project area falls within
the Edwards Limestone (Ked) formation. The Ked consists of fine to coarse-grained clay soils with
abundant chert and fossils. The thickness of the Edwards formation ranges from 300 to 500 feet
(Brown et al 1983).

Soils
According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey and the Soil
Survey of Bexar County, Texas (1991), the soils mapped for the project corridor include Brackett
gravelly clay loam (BrE) and Krum clay (Kr). Approximately 70 percent of the APE consists of
Brackett gravelly clay loam soils found west of the Cross Mountain Trail and Up Mountain Trail
intersection, except where a tributary to Leon Creek crosses the APE, while the remaining 30
percent of the APE generally consists of Krum clay soils, found east of this intersection.
Brackett gravelly clay loam soils, 12 to 20 percent slopes, are well-drained, grayish-brown soils
found on ridges and plateaus. A typical profile is grayish-brown gravelly clay loam from zero to four
inches followed by light brownish-gray gravelly clay loam from four to twelve inches, followed by
limestone bedrock from 12 to 30 inches (Taylor et al 1991).
Krum clay soils, zero to five percent slopes, are well-drained, very dark gray to gray-brown soils
found on stream terraces on river valleys. The parent material consists of alluvium derived from
limestone. A typical profile consists of very dark grayish-brown clay from zero to 62 inches thick
(Taylor et al 1991).
IV.

METHODS

A.

Archival Research Methods

Background research included accessing the THCâs online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas)
as well as a review of survey reports, site files, and maps on file at the THC and Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) (THC 2010). These resources were examined in
order to identify previously recorded sites and past investigations within the vicinity of the project
area. The aerial photo, USGS 7.5 minute quad map, geologic map, and USDA soil survey maps
were also examined prior to the field investigation. These supplemented the background
research and helped provide information on topography, soils, vegetation, geology, the local
environment, and levels of development in and around the project area.
B.

Field Methods

The intensive survey of the APE included a pedestrian survey of the projectâs APE that entailed
visual inspection of the ground surface for cultural resources supplemented with shovel testing.
All survey activities conducted within the projectâs APE were documented and complied with THC
and Council of Texas Archeologistsâ (CTA) survey standards unless documented field conditions
warranted otherwise.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards require a minimum of 16 shovel tests
per mile for linear projects. When assessed in regard to overall acreage, a total of 19 shovel tests
would have been required for the 1.2 mile long survey. Due to the disturbed nature of much of the
project APE, in addition to the generally good visibility (>30 percent) of the project APE, ten
shovel tests and cleaning and examination of four profile cut-backs for cultural materials were
deemed sufficient to meet the minimum survey standards. Excavated soils were screened
through Â¼-inch wire-mesh screens. Shovel tests were excavated until pre-Holocene deposits
were reached. Upon completion, shovel tests were backfilled.
Field notes were maintained and included information pertaining to terrain, vegetation, soils, land
forms, shovel tests, and cultural material observed. Standardized shovel test forms were

completed for every shovel test. These forms will include location data, depth, soil type, and
notations on artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo log were completed as
appropriate. The locations of all trenches, shovel tests, and profile cuts were recorded via
handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) units utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator
(UTM) coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) map datum. Newly
discovered prehistoric and historic archeological sites were defined in compliance with THC/CTA
survey standards and policies including requirements for assessing historical sites and
cemeteries.
This survey set out to employ a non-collection policy for cultural materials. Non-diagnostic
artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass) were described, sketched, and/or photodocumented in the field and replaced in the same location in which they were found. In the event
that diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, marked historic materials) were identified
in the field, they were to be collected and placed in plastic bags labeled with relevant provenience
information. Non-diagnostic artifacts were photo-documented in the field. Since no diagnostic
artifacts were encountered in the survey, the proposed collection policy was not implemented.
V.

RESULTS

A.

Results of Archival Research

The results of the background records review indicated that while no archeological sites have been
recorded within the APE, the APE has not been previously surveyed for cultural resources (THC
2010). A total of eight archeological sites (41BX81, 41BX82, 41BX86, 41BX88, 41BX89,
41BX1761, 41BX962, and 41BX1590) and one cemetery have been recorded within a one mile
radius of the project area (THC 2010).
A cluster of sites (41BX81, 41BX82, 41BX86, 41BX88, and 41BX89), recorded in 1971 during the
Leon Creek Survey, are located approximately one mile northeast of the project area. All of the
sites consist of prehistoric open campsites situated on terraces above Leon Creek or above
tributaries to Leon Creek. Archeological testing was recommended for sites 41BX86 and 41BX82
(THC 2010).
Site 41BX1761 is a historic, hand-laid stacked stone wall structure located less than a quarter of a
mile south of the project area. The wall runs east-west and measure a little over a meter in height,
500 meters in length, and dates to the mid-nineteenth century. The historic wall structure
possesses integrity and may possess research potential (THC 2010).
Site 41BX962, located less than one half mile east of the APE consists of a burned rock midden
from the Archaic Period. Bone tempered pottery sherds were observed at the site. The site is not
considered potentially eligible for listing as a SAL or for listing on the NRHP (THC 2010).
Site 41BX1590 is located one mile east of the project area. The site consists of a historic
homestead from the 1940âs and 1950âs. No structures remain at the site. The site is not considered
significant and no additional work is recommended (THC 2010).
The Funari cemetery (BX-CO67) is located one half mile south of the project area (THC 2010). The
cemetery will not be adversely impacted by the proposed project. No sites, including any listed in
the NRHP or designated as SALs, occur within or adjacent to the boundaries of the project area
(THC 2010). Based on the number of previously recorded sites, tributaries to Leon Creek, and

natural springs within the vicinity of the project area, there existed a moderate probability that
potential cultural materials may exist within the proposed alignment.
B.

Survey Results

Ground surface visibility throughout the project area was excellent - >95 percent visibility was
observed throughout most of the APE although some portions had poor visibility (<30 percent).
The field survey revealed that large sections of the APE had been disturbed by previous roadway
construction and adjacent development. Other disturbances observed within the APE include a
man-made drainage ditch that parallels roadway and construction of a gas line easement at the
southern length of the APE. Views of the project area are included as Appendix A.
A total of ten shovel tests were excavated within the APE. Four profile cuts were shovel scraped
and examined for cultural materials and the entire APE was visually inspected for cultural materials
on the ground surface. The majority of the soils within the APE consisted of shallow, very rocky,
dark-brown silty clay soils. Shovel Test 8 produced a lithic core. The core appears to have been
washed down into the APE from a possible site situated on an upland located on private property
outside of the APE. In addition to the positive shovel test, a crudely worked, possible lithic core was
observed on the ground surface at the bend in road toward the eastern half of the APE. Shovel
Test 10 was excavated within the vicinity of the surface find but failed to produce cultural materials.
No additional cultural materials were observed on the ground surface, in the four profiles of the
roadway cut-backs, or in the remaining shovel tests. Figure 3 shows a map of shovel test
locations as well as the location of the profile cuts and the location of the isolated find. Shovel
test data is included as Appendix B.

SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS

On behalf of SAWS, R-K performed an intensive cultural resources survey for the proposed
installation of 24-inch water main along Cross Mountain Trail in northwestern Bexar County,
Texas. The intensive survey was conducted to ensure compliance with the Antiquities Code of
Texas. Work was performed under Antiquities Permit No. 5599.
The results of the background records review indicated that while no archeological sites have been
recorded within the APE, the APE has not been previously surveyed for cultural resources (THC
2010). A total of eight archeological sites and one cemetery have been recorded within a one mile
radius of the APE. No sites, including any listed in the NRHP or designated as SALs, occur within
or adjacent to the boundaries of the APE (THC 2010). Based on the number of previously
recorded sites, tributaries to Leon Creek, and natural springs within the vicinity of the project area,
there existed a moderate to high probability that potential cultural materials may exist within the
proposed alignment.
The intensive survey of the APE entailed visual inspection of the ground surface coupled with
shovel testing. Previous construction impacts and land-use modifications have severely affected
or destroyed both surface and subsurface integrity of soil deposits throughout most of the APE.
A total of ten shovel tests and four profile cuts were excavated within the APE. One of the shovel
tests, Shovel Test 8, produced a lithic (chert) core and another crude lithic core was observed on
the ground surface at a bend in the road toward the easternmost half of the APE. These lithic
cores are considered isolated finds and likely represent runoff from a nearby site located north and
outside of the APE in the adjacent uplands that washed the artifacts into the APE.

Archeological Report

Other than the lithic core identified in Shovel Test 8 and the crude, lithic core, found on the
surface, no additional cultural materials, artifacts, or features were identified on the surface, in the
scraped profile cuts, or in any of the nine remaining shovel tests. Given the extent of
disturbances within the APE and the lack of cultural materials identified in the shovel tests, it is
highly unlikely that the proposed construction of the water main will encounter or impact intact and
significant archeological deposits, if any, in this disturbed setting.
No significant archeological or historic sites [36 CFR 800.16.(l)] or SALs (13 TAC Â§26.12) will be
affected by this project. Upon receiving concurrence from the THC, R-K recommends that SAWS
may proceed with construction activities as planned. Should the project area change, further work
may be required.
In the unlikely event that cultural materials are encountered during construction, all work should
cease at the location of the findings, and an Archaeologist at the THC-Archeology Division should
be contacted. In such a case, work will not commence until authorized by the required agencies.
