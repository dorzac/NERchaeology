ABSTRACT
A Phase I cultural resources survey of a 178,367 acre (278 square miles)
tract of land within the Bienville National Forest in central Smith County,
Mississippi was conducted by Dixie Environmental Services Co. (DESCO) under
the direction of Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA). The project
commenced on January 4, 2006 and ended on July 21, 2006 when the drilling
was completed. Archaeologists were in the field the entire time. Fifteen
archaeologists participated in the field survey, and one archaeologist performed
the laboratory analysis. The project area was wooded, and ground surface
visibility was poor except in eroded or disturbed areas.
The project area was examined by shovel testing as well as an inspection
of areas where the ground surface was exposed due to natural factors such as
erosion and human intervention (i.e., logging roads). Shovel tests were
excavated in pre-determined locations (source points and access roads)
identified by surveyors working in advance of the archaeologists.
The current study identified and recorded 50 prehistoric and historic sites
(22-Sm-1242 – 22-Sm-1247 and 22-Sm-1249 – 22-Sm-1292 during the initial
field survey. Two additional prehistoric sites (22-Sm-1293 and 22-Sm-1294)
were located and recorded during the monitoring phase. Of the 52 sites, only
three (22-Sm-1242, 22-Sm-1282, and 22-Sm-1283) are pure historic. One site
(22-Sm-1242) dates to the 19th and 20th centuries, while the others date mainly to
the 20th century. No Paleoindian sites were found. Six prehistoric sites are
Archaic or contain Archaic components, and 30 sites are Woodland or contain
Woodland components. Four of the Woodland sites have Gulf Formational
(Early Woodland) components. No pure Mississippian sites were identified;
however, Mississippian components are present at three Woodland sites. Sites
believed to contain research potential are listed in the report as ”potentially
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and on the
site cards at the Mississippi Department of Archives and History (MDAH) they
are listed as “unknown.” Those sites with little or no research potential are
referred to as “not eligible for listing in the NRHP” and “ineligible” on the site
cards at MDAH. In all, there are 19 sites designated as potentially eligible. No
sites were definitely listed as eligible for listing in the NRHP. The prehistoric sites
are described in this report as seasonal residential base camps, temporary
special use camps, and short term base camps. In addition, seven isolated finds
were documented.
All artifacts have been turned over to the United States Forest Service
(USFS) regional office in Forest, Mississippi until arrangements for permanent
curation can be made. Copies of the report are housed at MDAH, USFS, and
BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
Jurassic Operating proposes to conduct a seismic survey in the Bienville
National Forest in central Mississippi. This survey is referred to in this report as
the Smith County 3-D Seismic Survey. DESCO of Magnolia, Texas has been
retained by Jurassic Operating to provide an evaluation of the archaeological
resources within the project area. In order to accomplish this task, DESCO
subcontracted with BVRA to direct an archaeological survey of the entire project
area and produce a report that will satisfy the USFS, Bienville Ranger District,
and the SHPO for the State of Mississippi.
The Smith County 3-D Seismic Survey was conducted in an area that
overlaps 278 square miles (178,367 acres). The project area is located in the
southwestern part of the Bienville National Forest. It contains portions of the Old
Strong River Ranger District and the Caney Creek Wildlife Management Area.
The Bienville National Forest is located approximately halfway between Jackson
and Meridian, Mississippi on Interstate Highway 20 in central Mississippi. The
general location of the project area in relation to Smith County and the State of
Mississippi is depicted in Figure 1. The area examined by BVRA is depicted in
Figure 2.
The purpose of the proposed seismic survey was to provide a highresolution image of the subsurface geological features that will allow the client to
effectively evaluate the hydrocarbon reserves underlying the project area. The
seismic survey requires the use of motion sensing devices (receivers), which
would be deployed at regular intervals. The spacing between receiver lines is
1320 feet. The survey design will also incorporate a Pentolite energy source,
which will be placed at regular intervals in a block pattern.
The charge depth and configuration proposed consists of 140-foot holes
drilled at intervals of 220 feet along each source line. Each source location
(source point) will be loaded with a 5.5-pound charge of Pentolite, and the hole
will be plugged with bentonite (natural clay) to prevent the co-mingling of surface
water and ground water. The parameters of the 3-D Seismic Survey are as
follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Highland Drill Rigs or Articulating Tractor Drills will be used
The holes will be four inches in diameter
The energy charge will consist of 5.5 pounds of Pentolite
The depth of the drill holes will be 140 feet
The interval between source points will be 220 feet
The interval between receiver lines will be 1320 feet

This archaeological survey is required by Federal law under Section106 and
Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended, and in
accordance with the Standards and Guidelines established in 36 CFR Part 66,
Recovery of Scientific, Prehistoric, Historic, and Archaeological Data: Methods,
Standards and Reporting Requirements (Federal Register, Volume 42, Number
19 – Friday, January 18, 1977). An Archeological Resource Protection Act
(ARPA) permit was issued to William E. Moore of BVRA by the Heritage Program
Office of the Bienville National Forest in Forest, Mississippi. A Research Design
(Appendix I) was submitted to the SHPO and USFS and approved by these
agencies prior to the initiation of the field survey.
In addition to the archaeological survey, a Proposed, Endangered,
Threatened, and Sensitive Species survey was conducted by DESCO between
September 19th and November 16th 2005 to determine the presence or absence
of listed species and document their occurrence. This survey was completed in
order to fulfill requirements of the Endangered Species Act. The results of this
survey were included in a document entitled Biological Survey Report, Bienville
National Forest, prepared by DESCO (2005) and submitted to the USFS and the
United States Wildlife Service in December of 2005. Both agencies concurred
with the findings by DESCO that the seismic survey as proposed by Jurassic
Operating will not likely affect any proposed, endangered, threatened, or
sensitive species.
Edward P. Baxter, BA, RPA was the Project Archaeologist and conducted
the field survey. Rita D. Fields, M.A., R.P.A. co-authored the report and
analyzed most of the artifacts. Roger G. Moore, Ph.D., R.P.A., assisted with the
analysis of the historic artifacts.
This report is in two volumes. Volume I contains the description of the
field survey and results, while Volume II contains all appendices including the
location of all archaeological sites and isolated finds on topographic maps.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Introduction
The Smith County 3-D Seismic Survey area is located in Smith County
within the confines of the Bienville National Forest. The Bienville National Forest
consists of 178,367 acres and is located in central Mississippi. In addition to
Smith County, the Bienville National Forest falls within Scott, Newton, and Jasper
counties, Mississippi. The Bienville National Forest is one of six national forests
located in the state of Mississippi and provides recreational as well as wildlife
and timber management plans. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate a section of the forest
during the winter and spring.
Physiographic Setting
The project area is located in the Central/Southern Pine Hills region with a
narrow projection of the Jackson Prairie region located in the Strong River
bottom. This lies within the Coastal Plain Province. The Pine Hills region is
bounded on the north by the Jackson Prairie physiographic unit and on the south
by the Coastal Pine Meadows of the Mississippi Gulf Coast. In general, the Pine
Hills region is characterized by moderately high rolling upland ridges separated
by V-shaped ravines containing intermittent drains or springs and/or permanent
streams and creeks. Elevation varies throughout the Pine Hills. Moderate to
high hilltops are not uncommon with most of the area averaging between 300 to
500 feet above mean sea level (Cross and Wales 1974).
Two major rivers, the Strong River and the Leaf River, flow south through
or near the project area. The Leaf River, located in central Smith County, lies just
to the east of the project area and flows south where it joins the Chickasawhay
River to form the Pascagoula River system. The Strong River is located in the
extreme northwestern corner of the project area and flows southwestwardly to
the Pearl River that empties into the Gulf of Mexico. The project area is also
drained by numerous intermittent streams and perennial creeks including
Oakohay Creek, Old Field Creek, Jump Creek, Harrison Branch, Grand Sir
Branch, and Roberts Creek.
Geologic Setting
The Tertiary and Quaternary deposits exposed within the project area and
the immediate vicinity consists of surface and near surface loose sands, gravels,
and clay deposits. These sedimentary deposits date to the Oligocene, Miocene,
Pliocene, and Pleistocene epochs. Geologic units include the Forest Hill/Red
Bluff Formation (Vicksburg Group) and the Catahoula and Citronelle formations
(Walker and Coleman 1987).

The Forest Hill-Red Bluff Formation consists of extremely fossilerferous,
silty, dark gray clay. The Catahoula Formation is composed primarily of fine to
medium grained sands and gravels of various forms. Deleon (1981:12) notes
that small chert gravels as well as quartz pebbles are found in locally abundant
clusters on the surface. Ferruginous or silicified sandstone deposits are also
found within this formation. The Citronelle Formation consists of oxidized, nonmarine deposits. These include, but are not restricted to, silty sand deposits,
clayey sandy gravels, and sandy gravels with varying sand grain particle sizes
(Saucier 1994).
Lithic Resources
A wide diversity of raw material was used in the manufacture of stone
tools during prehistoric times and has been found at sites in the region. Identified
materials recovered from the surrounding area include Citronelle gravel chert,
Fort Payne chert, Catahoula quartzite, Kosciusko quartzite, Tallahatta quartzite,
quartz, sandstone, and chalcedony.
Citronelle Gravel Chert
This is a fine-to-coarse grained, rough-textured, cryptocrystalline material.
The morphological characteristics of Citronelle gravel chert vary according to
parent material types. Citronelle gravel chert was procured in the form of pebbles
and cobbles deposited during the Pliocene or Pleistocene epochs. Citronelle
gravels are part of the Citronelle Formation running through south Mississippi.
Source areas include streambeds or gravel bars and remnant ridge top deposits.
Citronelle gravels also include minor amounts of chalcedony, agate, jasper,
sandstone, quartz, and quartzite (Stallings 1989). Citronelle gravels range in
color from dark brown and gray/light gray, to very pale brown and tan/yellow and
may include multiple colors resulting in bands, speckles, or mottles (Stallings
1989; Keith 1998). Because of the coarse-grained nature of Citronelle gravel
chert, thermal alteration was often employed to enhance flaking qualities.
Thermally altered chert often resulted in a dark red to light pinkish-red color and
exhibit a glossy internal texture when flaked (Collins 1984).
Fort Payne Chert
Fort Payne chert is a fine-grained chert that occurs as layers and within
layers of carbonates in the Fort Payne Formation in northern Alabama, southern
Tennessee, and the very northeastern corner of Mississippi. It is also found in
blocks and nodules. Fort Payne chert is generally black or bluish-gray, but it also
occurs as bluish-white or white nodules. Some beds may be fossiliferous and
contain the remnants of microorganisms. Therefore, the quality of this material
ranges from poor to excellent, depending on the location of source materials.
There are no local sources for Fort Payne chert in the project area

Catahoula Quartzite
Catahoula quartzite, similar to Tallahatta quartzite, is classified as silica
cemented sandstone. The materials located in the project area are likely to date
to the Miocene age Upper Catahoula Formation. The matrix which makes up the
quartzite often includes medium to coarse grained quartz and tiny black chert
sands intermixed and cemented together forming a fine conchoidal fracture
property. Colors range from light gray to orange and have a white outer rind of
sand grit and quartz pea gravel.
Kosciusko Quartzite
Kosciusko quartzite is fine-grained cemented sandstone that is found in
laminated bands running in an arc through the Kosciusko Formation located to
the north and northwest of the project area. Kosciusko quartzite is also present
in sandy clays and cemented by silica. Additionally, it is similar to Tallahatta
quartzite in that it weathers over a period of time suggesting that artifacts made
from this material or rather old and may date to the Archaic period.
Tallahatta Quartzite
Tallahatta quartzite is a sedimentary quartzite consisting of fine to medium
sand grains cemented together by opal and chalcedony (Heinrich 1988). It was
named for the Tallahatta formation of the Tallahatta Hills of southwest Alabama.
The formation is of ancient marine origin. Although it extends across much of
south Alabama, it is mainly exposed in Choctaw and Clarke counties of western
Alabama. Classification of this material as quartzite is based on the observation
that fracture planes run through constituent grains of sand rather than around
them, at least for some samples. Tallahatta quartzite has a grainy, sandy texture
and varies in morphological characteristics, primarily in the degree of silica
present in each specimen (Heinrich 1988; Lehmann 1989). Varieties include well
cemented material which was heavily utilized during the Middle to Late Archaic
periods and others that, due to their physical constitution, are friable and more
susceptible to the affects of weathering (Heinrich 1988). Colors range from
medium gray and white to almost translucent with a speckled, pepper-like
appearance throughout the material. The salt-and-pepper appearance results
from inclusions of feldspar and glauconite (O’Hear and Lehmann 1983; Heinrich
1988; Lehmann 1989).
The Tallahatta Formation, from which knappable material was procured,
occurs in an arc running south from the southwestern portion of Tennessee
through central Mississippi down into southwestern Alabama and extending
eastward into southwestern Georgia (Lehmann 1989; O’Hear and Lehmann
1983). Eocene marine sediments of silicious claystone and mudstone form the
depositional layers are overlain by glauconitic and ferruginous sands and clays
(O’Hear and Lehmann 1983; Keith 1998; O’Hear 1990).

8

Quartz
Quartz is a fine-grained material formed in thin veins of metamorphic rock
formations of the Alabama Piedmont. Quartz may also be found in the Lime Hills
of southwestern Alabama as large cobbles in stream beds (Jeter and Futato
1990). In the project area, smaller pebbles are found in the Citronelle Formation.
Quartz is primarily thought of as a product of metamorphism of quartzite material.
The morphological characteristics include unpredictable fracturing, varying sizes,
and variations in hue. Colors range from a milky white opaque to a clear, almost
translucent quartz. Some varieties have pink veins traversing through small
fractures in the material, thus giving the quartz an overall pinkish hue (Prinz et al.
1977).
Sandstone
Two types of sandstone were included in this study: silicified or
ferruginous sandstone and a white to silvery-gray unnamed sandstone. Silicified
sandstone is a fine-grained to coarse-grained material cemented by iron oxide.
Colors range from black to deep purple, likely resulting from the iron oxide silica
cementation. The composition of silicified sandstone includes sand, which
contains 15% polycrystalline quartz and some chert materials.
It is
characteristically a hard, nearly quartzitic material exhibiting fair conchoidal
fracture properties, thus producing usable chipped stone artifacts (Heinrich
1988). Knappable silicified sandstone occurs throughout southeast Mississippi
and southwestern Alabama as inclusions within non-ferruginous or low-quality
deposits and gravel bars (Lumpkin 1994; Reams 1995; Keith 1998; Fields et al.
2005). Local ferruginous sandstone occurs in variable quality and texture. The
Regional Specialist has noted outcrops of silicified sandstone in the southeastern
portion of the Chickasawhay Ranger District. These outcrops include high quality
as well as low quality material.
Subsumed under this general category is a white to silvery-gray
sandstone material of apparent local sources. Grace Keith (1997) and Scot Keith
(1998) classified this material as an orthoquartzite, which is a clastic,
sedimentary material composed mostly of quartz and lacking the fine-grained
texture characteristic of silicified sandstone (Brown et al. 1996). Archaeologists
at the Chickasawhay Ranger District previously classified this material as
Kosciusko quartzite (Reams 1996a). Further examination by a geologist reveals
that it is not a quartzitic material. Instead, he describes it as a coarse-grained,
non-ferruginous sandstone (Douglas Haywick, personal communication 2001).

Chalcedony
Chalcedony is a translucent to opaque, generally waxy-appearing
cryptocrystalline quartz. It is characterized by microscopic fibrous crystal bands.
Colors include milky pale white, pale blue, brown, and black. It is often found as
a component of other material types, and occurs as an aqueous deposit within
rock cavities. Chalcedony can be found within the Citronelle Formation deposits
extending throughout southeast and southwest Mississippi. Like other material
of the Citronelle Formation, chalcedony is found in the form of pebbles and
cobbles of varying sizes and shapes (Brown et al. 1996).

Flora and Fauna
Heterogeneous pine-oak forests exist near major and minor water sources
such as ravines and bottomlands. These mixed pine-hardwood forests consist of
several varieties of oaks, sweetgum, magnolia, and cypress (Cross and Wales
1974; DeLeon 1981). Nut producing hardwoods such as pecan (Carya
illinoisensis), and other hickories (Carya spp.) along with several varieties of oaks
(Quercus spp.), are more prevalent in the floodplains and stream bottoms and
would have provided hunter-gatherers with a storable, high calorie food source.
Additionally, fruit-producing understory including mulberry (Morus rubra),
muscadine (Vitus rotundifolia), and mayhaws (Crataegus opaca, C. rufula) were
potentially included in the diet of prehistoric hunter-gatherers (Jackson 1995).
In addition to fruit and nut producing plant species, edible seed producing
plants such as sunflower (Helianthus annuus), sumpweed/marsh elder (Iva
annua), pigweed (Amaranthus sp.), maygrass, and goosefoot (Chenopodium)
used by hunter/gatherers in some parts of eastern North America, showed
evidence of domestication by 200 B.C. (Smith 1992; Gremillion 1998). In the
mid-continent region, a cultivated variety of chenopod occurs in a number of
archaeological contexts as early as 1500 B.C. including dry, Kentucky rock
shelters such as Cloudsplitter and Newt Kash (Gremillion 1998). At present, no
evidence of horticulture or plant domestication for the Pine Hills is available.
A variety of animal resources, mainly from an upland forest setting,
provided potential meat sources for prehistoric hunter-gatherers inhabiting this
area. The archaeological record of the Pine Hills provides little evidence for
prehistoric animal exploitation.
Faunal remains, which offer information
regarding subsistence organization, generally do not survive due to the highly
acidic soil. However, the presence of numerous varieties of acorn producing oak
and scrub oaks would have provided a rich habitat for white-tailed deer
(Odocoileus virginianus), squirrel (Sciurus sp.), and wild turkey (Meleagris
gallopavo). Other resident mammal species likely exploited by prehistoric
hunters include raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), as wel
as cottontail and swamp rabbits (syvilagus) (Hudson 1976; Jackson 1995).
Fish species available for consumption would have included several
species of catfish (Ictaluridae spp.), gar (Lepissteidae spp.), suckers
(Catostomidae spp.), bass (Lacepedae spp.), and bowfins (Amiidae spp.) (Cross
and Wales 1974). Stream and creek surveys conducted by the wildlife biologist
on the Chickasawhay Ranger District produced bluegill (Gulosus macrochirus),
several species of sunfish (Lepomis spp.), shiners (Notropis spp.), and pirate
perch (Aphredoderus sayanus) as the most common for small streams and
creeks in this region (Carol Brown, personal communication 2001).

Paleo-Environmental Background
Beginning in the Late Pleistocene, dramatic changes emerged across
much of the southeastern landscape. The Wisconsin Laurentide ice sheet
reached its peak at roughly 18,000 years Before Present (B.P.), bringing with it
as much as a 90-meter drop in sea level. This dramatic drop in sea level caused
some areas to fall between 100 and 130 meters below the present day level
(Smith 1986). After 17,000 B.P., ice sheets covering much of the lower
southeastern portion of North America began receding, causing a gradual
change in post-glacial climate and temperature. Climate conditions became drier
and cooler during the Early Holocene. This transition in climate and temperature
brought a change in vegetation across much of the Southeast, which
subsequently affected hunters and gatherers.
The Late Pleistocene boreal forests, dominated by spruce and pine, gave
way to an early Holocene temperate deciduous forest consisting of high
percentages of oak and hickory combined with the more fire resistant southern
pine species (Delcourt and Delcourt 1981; Smith 1986; Steponaitis 1986;
Anderson et al. 1996). As a result, a more homogenous, mesic oak-hickory
forest gradually replaced the patchy glacial, boreal forest of the Southeast by
10,000 B.P. (Anderson et al. 1996). Additionally, the decrease in ice sheet level
and mass allowed arctic air to filter into parts of the Southeast, bringing about
modern westerly-dominated air circulation patterns between 12,500 B.P. and
11,000 B.P. (Smith 1986:3).
The period of the Early Holocene between 10,000 B.P. and 8000 B.P.
shows a climate shift in the Gulf Coastal Plains from arid to humid. This is
followed by the Middle Holocene period, and is characterized as a time of
transition and stabilization. Braided streams gave way to meandering, stable
river systems, increasing the density and variety of aquatic wildlife in most parts
of the Southeast (Schuldenrein 1996). Middle Holocene summer thunderstorms
with frequent lightening-set forest fires replaced the warm dry summers of the
Early Holocene. Subsequently, the increase in forest fires instigated a shift away
from hardwood-dominated forests towards the more fire-tolerant pine species
(Smith 1986). This period of climatic change is also referred to as the Altithermal
or Hypsithermal period, and in recent years, has been the subject of considerable
debate regarding the cultural adaptations of prehistoric hunter-gatherers
(Brookes and Reams 1996).
At the beginning of the late Holocene (5000 B.P.), a fire-dominated
Longleaf pine forest reached from the Atlantic Coastal Plain to portions of
eastern Texas (Smith 1986). By 4500 B.P., sea levels approached to within two
meters of present day stands. Smith (1986:5) concludes that modern climatic
vegetation conditions were in place over much of the greater Southeast.

14

CULTURE SEQUENCE
Prehistoric occupation in the Southeast is divided into the following major
stages by archaeologists: Paleoindian, Archaic, Gulf Formational, Woodland,
Mississippian, and Protohistoric. Table 1 presents one of several schemes of
chronological divisions of southeastern prehistory.* The following discussion is a
review of chronological stages and cultural periods relevant to the research area.
Although general cultural trends are discussed, specific emphasis is given to
settlement adaptations and the organization of technology for each.
Paleoindian Stage
The Paleoindian stage represents the initial settlement and habitation of
prehistoric human populations across much of the North American continent. In
general, initial colonization of the Southeast is believed to have occurred
sometime between 12,500 B.P. and 10,000 B.P., corresponding with the first
appearance and occurrence of lanceolate fluted Clovis points (Anderson 1996).
Several theories and models have been developed to explain the initial
movement and spread of Paleoindian populations and adaptive strategies (Martin
1973; Claggett and Cable 1982; Meltzer and Smith 1986; Kelly and Todd 1988;
Anderson 1990). Anderson (1996:36) suggests initial southeastern Paleoindian
settlement concentrated along major river valleys including the Ohio,
Cumberland, and Tennessee. Populations are believed to have settled into
these “staging areas” due to the usefulness of major waterway transportation
routes as well as the ecologically rich resource areas the river valleys provided.
Furthermore, Anderson (1996:34-39) proposed that population growth resulted
from the reduction in hunter-gatherer mobility, thus leading to branching out in
subsequent periods.
Regional environmental landscape differences are suggested as one
variable that affected early prehistoric adaptations (Cable 1996:113). In areas
dominated by a patchy, glacial landscape and forest structure, most
archaeologists generally agree that early Paleoindian groups utilized a logistically
organized adaptation (after Binford 1980) and constructed a tool kit of finely
crafted, reliable artifacts (Smith 1986; Anderson and Hanson 1988; Anderson et
al. 1996; Cable 1996).
As part of a logistical adaptation, the patchy
environmental structure would have favored a central base located in close
proximity to one or more critical resources with small logistical task groups
radiating out to procure other needed resources not found within the immediate
vicinity of the residential base (after Binford 1980).

Table 1. Regional Culture Historical Framework

16

Paleoindian occupation in southeast and central Mississippi is primarily
found in the Loess Hills portion and appears to represent minimal distribution
across the state. According to McGahey (1996:381), most of what is known
about Paleoindian occupation in southeast and central Mississippi is based on
the distribution of surface collections and scattered archaeological investigations.
By the middle of the Paleoindian Stage, smaller bands of hunter-gatherers
moved away from initial areas of settlement and ventured into unexplored
environmental areas forming distinct and diverse sub-regional population groups
(Anderson 1996:37). Environmental variability is posited as one variable that
affected the emergence of sub-regional cultural traditions (Anderson et al.
1996:6). Additionally, climatic and environmental changes resulted in the
widespread extinction of over thirty-five species of mega-fauna, including
mammoth, mastodon, bison, and the giant ground sloth. With the depletion of
the mega-faunal subsistence base, a shift to a heavier reliance on smaller game
as well as floral resources may have occurred (Steponaitis 1986:369-370). As a
result, middle Paleoindian populations faced multiple adaptive challenges,
including environmental as well as subsistence base changes.
During the middle part of the Paleoindian Stage, a gradual increase in
prehistoric occupation occurred. The majority of recorded sites containing Middle
Paleoindian components are associated with major streams or creeks in the
Loess Hills of southern Mississippi.
The Late Paleoindian Period is generally viewed as a continuation toward
a more generalized forager based system focusing on a broad range of
subsistence resources (Steponaitis 1986; Anderson et al. 1996). According to
Smith (1986:9-10), Late Paleoindian groups may have favored a more focal
subsistence pattern focusing on a narrow range of riverine species rather than a
broad, general range of species despite an abundance and diversity in available
resources. Despite this suggestion, Smith (1986:10) is quick to point out the
limitations, due in part to the relatively limited evidence such as faunal remains
and plant processing implements found on late Paleoindian sites. The continual
expansion and population growth in parts of the Southeast is evident by an
increase in the number of sites dating to the late Paleoindian Period.
The Paleoindian occupation in the project area is primarily represented by
sites containing low frequencies of lithic debitage and low stone tool diversity,
suggesting a limited or task specific site orientation (e.g., Deleon 1978; Keith
1998). Larger floodplain sites may potentially represent seasonal or residential
base camps. Upland sites may, therefore, represent small, single task-specific
forays and extraction camps tied to larger residential base camps located on the
floodplain.

17

Archaic Stage
At the close of the Paleoindian Stage, essentially coinciding with the
termination of the Pleistocene and onset of the Holocene Epoch, a continued
adaptation to environmental conditions affected prehistoric hunter-gatherers
across much of the Southeast. The beginning of the period, circa 10,000 B.P., is
traditionally interpreted as a continuation of Pleistocene adaptations, which
includes continued high residential mobility, generalized foraging patterns, and
similar technological organization (Bense 1994; Smith 1986).
Settlement and mobility adaptation for the Early Archaic Period in the
Southeast have been extensively studied and linked to ecological changes
following the emergence of homogeneous, hardwood forest structures (Cable
1982, 1996). A mixture of both forager and collector settlement adaptations is
inferred for Early Archaic Period populations (Anderson and Hanson 1988).
Moreover, settlement adaptations and subsistence structures are tied to the
establishment of territories defined by major drainage systems, at least along the
Atlantic Slope (Anderson and Hanson 1988).
In the project area, relatively few intact Early Archaic Period deposits have
been excavated, precluding the formulation of settlement and mobility patterns.
South of the project area on the Chickasawhay Ranger District, Keith (1998:148)
interpreted the Early Archaic Period component at the Sandhill site (22-Wa-676)
as representing a foraging residential camp.
Keith (1998) based his
interpretation on the diversity of raw material types, which included Coastal Plain
agate and chert and Tallahatta quartzite. This high diversity indicated site
occupants maintained a high degree of mobility (Keith 1998). In southwest
Alabama, Campbell et al. (1988) identified eight sites containing Early Archaic
Period components, producing Greenbriar, Big Sandy, Kirk, Lost Lake, and
Palmer projectile points. Similarly, the sites are interpreted as representing
foraging residential camps (Campbell et al. 1988:10-37).
Jackson and Scott (1992) interpreted the G.W.O. site (22-Jo-568), located
on the floodplain of Bogue Homa Creek, as a forager residence. The recovery of
several utilized sandstone artifacts, which may have served as plant processing
implements, led Jackson and Scott (1992:73) to suggest the site was possibly
utilized over an extended period of time or reused frequently enough to stash
heavy “site furniture.” More recently, the Oo-Oo-Lation site (22-Gn-668) was
tested by the University of Southern Mississippi in 2001 for the Mississippi
Department of Transportation (Jackson and Fields 2000a, 2000b). It produced
two Hardaway Side Notched projectile points manufactured from Tallahatta
quartzite. These specimens exhibited considerable erosion and weathering.
Complete projectile points in combination with the full range of broken formal and
expedient tools suggest an extended use of the site such as a residential base
camp for mobile foragers.

18

The termination of the Early Archaic Period and beginning of the Middle
Archaic Period coincided with the Middle Holocene climatic episode known as
the Altithermal or Hypsithermal. Hypsithermal climate was both drier and warmer
(Smith 1986:6; Schuldenrein 1996). Additionally, the Middle Holocene was a
period of riverine stabilization as a result of sea level rise. Major rivers shifted to
meandering systems and are associated with the appearance of oxbow lakes
and backwater swamps (Smith 1986:22). As a result, altered riverine habitats
provided areas of increased aquatic resources.
With an increase in, and addition of, aquatic species providing predictable
subsistence resources, a shift in settlement adaptations from relatively mobile
year-round movement toward a somewhat semi-permanent system is inferred for
some parts of the Southeast (Smith 1986:24). During low-water seasons
(summer-fall), semi-permanent residential base camp occupation is thought to
have occurred. As rainy season weather produced rising water levels and soggy,
undesirable conditions, groups may have been forced to relocate to drier, upland
settings where winter and early spring residential base camps were established
(Smith 1986). Residential base camps of this type were potentially supported by
a collector-based system (after Binford 1980), in which logistical forays extracted
surrounding resources.
Support for a Middle Holocene settlement shift comes in an apparent
increase in thick, spatially concentrated shell and mound midden sites (Rafferty
et al. 1980; Bense 1994:82; Claussen 1996; Sassaman 1996). Evidence of
prepared clay floors and debris accumulation around outer edges of dwellings,
indicates sweeping out of debris and also substantiates an increase in site
renewal and reuse (e.g. Lewis and Lewis 1961; Rafferty et al. 1980; Ensor and
Studer 1983). Earlier period sites exhibit a spatial spreading of intra-site
activities with no accumulation of midden debris, possibly indicating a relatively
low site return rate.
Only limited evidence is available for Middle Archaic Period occupation in
the project area. The following sites are not in the project area. They are
mentioned here because they provide comparative data for the kinds of sites that
may be present. A single Middle Archaic Period point represents evidence of at
least minimum use of the Burkett’s Creek site (22-Fo-748) (Jackson 1995).
However, due to the lack of associated artifacts, site function for this brief
occupation is speculative at best. The Sand Hill site (22-Wa-676) represents a
moderate Middle Archaic Period occupation. The Middle Archaic Period
component, which contained evidence of cooking/heating activities in the form of
sandstone/baked clay concentrations, was interpreted as the residence of mobile
foragers (Keith 1998:51).

19

Excavation at Tanya’s Knoll (22-Wa-642), in the Chickasawhay Ranger
District, DeSoto National Forest, produced a Middle Archaic Period component
dominated by non-local Tallahatta quartzite, Coastal Plain agate, and chert, as
well as local silicified sandstone (Reams 1996b; Jackson and Fields 2000b;
Fields 2001b). Fields (2001b) interpreted the Middle Archaic Period occupation
as representing a residential base camp for mobile foragers. Interpretation was
based on the presence of biface manufacture and maintenance coupled with
some core reduction, suggesting a wide range of functional needs. Stone tools
recovered included projectile points broken during re-sharpening activities,
completing multi-functional tasks, or further thinning that occurred during the later
stages of manufacture. Exhausted stone tools and hafting elements are also
present, indicating discard and replacement. Such a broad range of tool needs
and activities are characteristic of residential base camps (Fields 2001b:118).
Similarly, the Oo-Oo-Lation site (22-Gn-668), produced Middle Archaic Period
artifacts and a lithic debitage assemblage consistent with activities characteristic
of residential base camps. Furthermore, the identification of several burned clay
or sandstone concentrations interpreted as hearths, one of which produced a
date of 7010+ 40 B.P. (calibrated 5990 B.C. to 6790 B.C.), supports the inference
for extended use by prehistoric hunter-gatherers (Jackson and Fields 2000a,
2000b; Fields 2001a, 2001b).
Reams (Reams and Carr 2001) conducted limited excavations at several
sites containing Middle Archaic Period components in the DeSoto Ranger
District. One of these (22-Pe-668) contained a large collection of Crane points, a
wide-based, broad-bladed Middle Archaic Period point manufactured from local
as well as non-local material. In southwest Alabama, eight Middle Archaic Period
sites were recorded during the Mobile Bay Pipeline Project (Campbell et al.
1988). Of the eight, only one was actually located within the Pine Hills. The
remainder of sites was located nearer to Tallahatta quartzite outcrops,
presumably for the exploitation and quarrying activities associated with that raw
material. According to Campbell et al. (1988:10-40), these sites appear to
represent only limited use, and they probably functioned as short term seasonal
or station camps with residential base camps located elsewhere.
Shifts in technological innovations and social and cultural complexity has
been observed throughout the Southeast for the Middle Archaic Period (Brookes
2000). During the environmental upheavals that occurred as a result of the
Hypsithermal and stress related to population growth, prehistoric populations
probably believed it necessary to form inter-societal trade networks. The Benton
Interaction Sphere, recorded for northeastern Mississippi, is believed to have
originated as a means of reducing potential stress and forming inter-societal ties
among kin groups (Johnson and Brookes 1989). During this time period, ground
and polished stone items such as polished effigies, grooved axes, oversized
bifaces, zoomorphic beads, bannerstones, and gorgets appear to have
ceremonial and/or ritually ornamental value (Connaway 1977, 1981; Bense
1994:75-78; Sassaman 1996; Brookes 2000).

20

At present, there is no evidence to support an inference of inter-societal
trade and interaction in southern Mississippi. However, the recovery of two
bannerstone fragments, one recovered from the Kittrell site (22-Jo-788) and the
other from excavations at the G. W. O. site (22-Jo-568) (Jackson and Scott
1992), support the possibility of long distance trade in the project area.
Shortly after 6000 B.P., modern climatic conditions were established,
bringing cooler and moister weather conditions and a southeastern landscape
covered by modern vegetation (Bense 1994:85). Sea levels stabilized between
5000 B.P. and 3000 B.P., creating modern barrier islands and coastal
ecosystems (Bense 1994:85).
The Late Archaic Period represents a period of increased cultural
innovations and developments across much of the Southeast. These
developments and innovations are marked by what Steponaitis (1986:373) terms
“four salient trends.” They include the adoption and domestication of several
indigenous plant species; the first use of ceramic containers; a continued
intensification of long-distance exchange; and evidence of an increase in
sedentism supported by the accumulation of thick midden deposits, dwellings,
storage facilities, and burials (Steponaitis (1986:373).
In addition to these four trends, large-scale earthworks and mound
construction, formerly attributed to the Woodland tradition, have been reliably
dated to the Late Archaic Period and, in some instances, as early as the late
Middle Archaic Period (Russo 1994; Saunders et al. 1997). At present, no
mounds dating to the Archaic Period have been recorded in the project area. The
following sites are not in the project area. They are mentioned here because
they provide comparative data for the kinds of sites that may be present. Recent
investigations at the Deathly Silent Mound (22-Fo-826), a small conical mound
located in the DeSoto Ranger District, produced no ceramics in the mound fill or
sub-mound surface area, thus providing the possibility of a pre-ceramic origin
(Robert Reams, personal communication 2001).
Settlement-subsistence patterns for the Southeast during the Late Archaic
Period are generally perceived as reflecting increasing sedentism and population
growth. Long-term, dry-season residential base camp occupations tethered to
stream and creek environments are inferred due to the abundance of aquatic
resources as well as floodplain animal and cultigen species. Inter-riverine upland
habitations, in the form of small, short-term base camp occupations, were
perhaps utilized seasonally as a supplement to a continual trend toward
sedentism (Smith 1986:31-32).

21

The apparent population growth in the project area is represented by a
steady increase in the number of sites containing Late Archaic Period
components. Newell Wright (1982, 1984) excavated August Bluff (22-Pe-543), a
single Late Archaic Period component site located on a bluff overlooking the Leaf
River in Perry County. The site produced several hearths and a lithic technology
that used Citronelle gravel, presumably collected from gravel bar sources on the
Leaf River. Identified projectile point types include Pontchartrain, Kent, and Gary.
In another study, McMakin (1995) analyzed the lithic technological organization
from the Jeff Parker site (22-Fo-608) located in Forrest County. McMakin (1995)
interpreted the site as representing a residential site. Interpretations were based
on a diverse assemblage structure consisting of formal tools, fired clay hearths,
numerous other chipped stone tools, and debitage representing the full range of
reduction sequences characteristic of residential sites.
Similarly, Keith (1998) interpreted the Late Archaic Period occupation at
the Sandhill site (22-Wa-676) as a residential base camp for logistically
organized collectors. Like the Jeff Parker site (22-Fo-608), the Late Archaic
Period component contained a diverse assemblage structure, including lithic
debitage reflective of all manufacturing stages, burned clay features, expedient
flake tools, and formal stone tools, discarded as a result of their exhausted and
fragmented condition. Keith (1998:151) noted what appeared to be baked clay
daub, suggesting the presence of house structures and extended occupations, at
least on a seasonal basis.
The Late Archaic Period component at 22-Pr-533 in Pearl River County is
interpreted as representing the remains of a special purpose extractive camp for
logistically organized collectors (Brown et al. 1997:433). Inferences were based
on low assemblage diversity; the recovery of large amounts of small expedient
flake tools, fired clay features, and the presence of at least two pits. Additionally,
the recovery of faunal remains, including deer and turtle as well as rabbit protein
extracted from a clay cooking ball, indicates the procurement and consumption of
wild animals (Brown et al. 1997:437).
Gulf Formational Stage
The initial introduction and manufacture of ceramic containers in the
Southeast marks the inception of what archaeologists call the Gulf Formational
Stage. Walthall and Jenkins (1976) first defined the Gulf Formational Stage as a
way of differentiating areas of initial and subsequent ceramic production in the
southeast and northeast portions of the United States. For the most part, the
Gulf Formational Stage incorporates the terminal Late Archaic Period and the
initial Early Woodland Period and includes the geographical area extending from
the Coastal Plain of South Carolina through Louisiana (Walthall 1980).

22

The earliest evidence of ceramic manufacture is found along the eastern
Atlantic Seaboard and includes parts of Georgia and South Carolina, as well as
the northeastern part of Florida (Sassaman 1993a). Prior to the manufacture of
ceramic containers, prehistoric people utilized various types of stone material,
including steatite and soapstone, for use as containers or cooking slabs.
Between 4500 B.P. and 2500 B.P., the first ceramic vessels were manufactured
using organic fiber as a tempering agent (Sassaman 1993b:16). However, the
technique of ceramic manufacture did not arrive in the Pine Hills area until after
3200 B.P.
The Middle Gulf Formational Period marks the initial spread of ceramic
making technologies into parts of Mississippi, Tennessee, and Alabama. In
Mississippi and Alabama, the earliest form of ceramic technology is represented
by fiber-tempered Wheeler Series pottery.
Plain, undecorated wares
characterize early Wheeler ceramics in the Pine Hills area and are primarily
found in the eastern portion of the area (Keith 1997; Jackson et al. 2002).
Settlement adaptations for the Middle Gulf Formational Period follow the
already established patterns of the Late Archaic Period: Spring and summer
residential base camps were located on creek or river floodplains. During the fall
and winter, wet-season camps shifted to the uplands (Walthall 1980; Brown et al.
1996). The presence of numerous terminal Late Archaic/Early Woodland Period
sites in the Chickasawhay Ranger District support the inference for small, upland
camp occupation. For the most part, these sites are located on minor creek
tributaries, which only flow continuously during wet, rainy seasons of fall and
winter. The lack of aquatic resources and the relatively small size of these sites
lead one to believe that habitation was by small, kin-based family groups.
However, the lack of excavated, tested, and analyzed sites means this
interpretation is tentative.
A number of Middle Gulf Formational Period sites found in the Pine Hills
area are represented by the presence of Wheeler Plain ceramics. In the
Chickasawhay Ranger District, Wheeler series ceramics were recovered from
22-Wa-676 (Sandhill site) and 22-Wa-678 located nearby (Keith 1998). Further
south in the DeSoto Ranger District, Wheeler ceramics are recorded for a
number of sites (Jackson et al. 2002). Along the Mobile Bay pipeline, Campbell
et al. (1988) recorded twelve sites containing Middle Gulf Formational Period
components. Most sites are recorded as limited, short-term camps and are
situated near Tallahatta quartzite outcrops. Campbell et al. (1988) suggest the
sites were not occupied on a seasonal basis based on the low assemblage
structure. However, the co-occurrence of projectile points and ceramics
suggests at least some were inhabited for more extended periods of time
(Campbell et al. 1988:10-43).

23

The Middle Gulf Formational Period is also characterized by the
emergence and escalation of the Poverty Point culture of the Lower Mississippi
Valley. The Poverty Point culture is characterized by extensive inter-societal and
intra-societal trade networks, lapidary and microlith industries, and the use of
distinct clay cooking balls referred to as Poverty Point objects (Smith 1986:3233). Several sites along the Gulf Coast participated in and are associated with
the Poverty Point Interaction Sphere, including the Claiborne site (22-Ha-501),
the Cedarland site (22-Ha-506), and Applestreet (22-Ja-530) (Blitz and Mann
2000). No sites associated with the Poverty Point culture have been recorded in
the Pine Hills. However, the Robinson site (22-Fo-580) and Burkett’s Creek (22Fo-748) produced steatite vessel fragments, a trade item characteristic of the
Poverty Point culture (Jackson 1995). These two sites are located in Forrest
County, Mississippi.
At the close of the Middle Gulf Formational Period, sand-tempered and
grog-tempered wares gradually spread and replaced fiber-tempered ceramics,
becoming more prevalent in the archaeological assemblages of the Pine Hills.
Three different series of ceramic wares generally characterize Late Gulf
Formational assemblages in the Pine Hills. Types manufactured locally during
this period include those associated with Alexander, Tchefuncte, and Bayou La
Batre series and exhibit a variety of decoration techniques, vessel shapes, paste,
and temper characteristics (Keith 1997; Jackson et al. 2002: 17).
In the Pine Hills area, Late Gulf Formational Period data are represented
by only limited excavations and appear to represent variable settlement
adaptations and site complexity. Excavations at the Sandhill site (22-Wa-676)
produced both Alexander Punctated and Bayou La Batre Plain ceramics;
however, Tchefuncte series sherds were not recovered (Keith 1998:54).
Additional Late Gulf Formational Period data come from surveys and
excavations along the Archusa Creek drainage in Clarke County (Marshall 1982).
Salvage work at 22-Ck-526 revealed an extensive Late Gulf Formational Period
occupation. Mechanical site stripping exposed more than 40 features, including
storage pits and fire hearths containing burned clay fragments and sandstone
clasts (Marshall 1982).
Late Gulf Formational Period occupations are
represented at Burkett’s Creek (22-Fo-748) by the recovery of several
Pontchartrain points and a single Flint Creek point, as well as two new varieties
of Tchefuncte Plain ceramics, identified by the presence or absence of sand in
the paste (Jackson 1995). Jackson (1995:74) interpreted Burkett’s Creek as
possibly representing a short term, repeatedly used foraging camp. Similarly,
Dunn’s (1999:85) analysis of lithics from Swamp Child (22-Fo-666), an upland
ridge site overlooking the Black Creek drainage, envisioned the Late Gulf
Formational Period occupation as representing one of short-term, varying reoccupational episodes by residentially mobile foragers.

24

Woodland Stage
As previously noted, the discussion of the Gulf Formational Stage included
both the terminal Late Archaic and Early Woodland cultural periods. Therefore,
the Early Woodland Period cultural sequence will not be discussed in the
Woodland Stage. In general, the Middle Woodland Period represents a time of
continued and increasing social interaction. Increasing societal interactions
resulted in intensive and exotic trade networks, burial mound construction, and a
general shared ideology that is reflected in ceramic design and decoration. The
culmination and emergence of extensive trade networks and shared ideologies
has generally been associated with what archaeologists term the Hopewellian
Interaction Sphere or Hopewell Ceremonial Complex (Bense 1994). The
Hopewell emergence is characterized by exotic trade items, which include
galena, mica cutouts, non-local lithic material, elaborate mortuary patterns, and
copper artifacts such as copper covered pan pipes (Bense 1994:140).
Southeast and central Mississippi is cradled on the edge of three distinct,
yet somewhat related, Hopewellian/Middle Woodland Period culture areas.
These are the Marksville culture located to the west in the Lower Mississippi
Valley, the Porter Middle Woodland Period in the Mobile Bay region, and the
Miller culture represented north along the Tombigbee River Area (Walthall 1980;
Jenkins and Kraus 1986; Blitz and Mann 2000; Jackson et al. 2002). Similar
ideologies and suggested influences are apparent in recovered ceramic
assemblages in the Pine Hills. Ceramics classified as Marksville incised,
characterized by wide curvilinear designs, are among the most common
decorated types and have been found at a number of sites located in the
Chickasawhay Ranger District.
Bone-tempered Turkey Paw Plain and Turkey Paw Cord Marked sherds,
similar to Mulberry Creek Cord Marked variety Tallahalla, have also been
recorded for sites in the Pine Hills area (Brown et al. 1996; Jackson et al. 1999).
Other recorded ceramic types include sand-tempered Baldwin Plain, Saltillo
Fabric Impressed, and Furr’s Cord Marked, indicating a Miller II association
(Keith 1997, Jackson et al. 2002).
As previously discussed, earthen mound construction began as early as
the terminal Middle Archaic Period and continued into subsequent periods.
Mound construction intensified during Middle Woodland Period times as
elaborate mortuary processing and burial facilities. At present, Middle Woodland
Period mound construction in this area is limited to only a few examples and
includes no mounds within the immediate vicinity of this research project.
Excavated Middle Woodland Period mounds in the area include the McRae
Mound (22-Ck-533) in Clarke County, Mississippi (Blitz 1985) and the
McQuorquodale Mound (1CK25) in Clarke County, Alabama (Wimberly and
Tourtelot 1941).

25

Analysis and comparison of the McRae Mound (22-Ck-533) construction
and associated artifact assemblages suggests this mound functioned as a
mortuary platform facility, possibly similar to Ohio/Hopewell facilities (Blitz
1985:30).
Likewise, McQuorquodale Mound was interpreted as representing part of
the Hopewellian manifestation due in part to the presence of a copper ear spool,
a copper bead, mica sheets, and galena (Wimberly and Tourtelot 1941).
Middle Woodland Period settlement adaptations continue to appear
variable with a possible mixture of both forager and collector adaptive strategies.
However, increasing populations and evidence of long-term site occupations
indicate a heavier reliance on collector strategies. At 22-Pr-533, Brown et al.
(1996:433-434) interpreted the Middle Woodland Period occupation as
representing a special purpose fall-winter extraction camp, possibly part of a
logistical subsistence structure. Numerous ferruginous sandstone and ironstone
concentrations represented potential hearth features.
The technological
organization included expedient flake tools and projectile points, similar to Late
Archaic Periods specimens recovered from earlier occupations, and a relatively
higher diversity in artifacts and features, suggesting longer occupational
episodes (Brown et al. 1996).
Middle Woodland Period occupations at the Sandhill site (22-Wa-676)
revealed an artifact assemblage inferred as representing a seasonal residential
base camp for logistically organized collectors (Keith 1998). Lithic technology for
the Middle Woodland Period occupation reflects an increasing reliance on locally
available gravel chert and higher frequencies of lithic debitage. The data suggest
increasing sedentism and reduced mobility, a trend observed during previous
periods, beginning in the Late Archaic (Keith 1998:155-156).
There have been at least eight limited excavations by Robert Reams
(personal communications 2001) conducted at Middle Woodland Period sites in
Perry County. Most of these are noted as being quite extensive and may
represent collector-based systems. In the Chickasawhay Ranger District, Middle
Woodland Period components represent the highest majority of recorded site
types. Based on the number of recorded Middle Woodland Period components
in the Pine Hills, prehistoric populations may have peaked in occupation during
this period (Jackson et al. 2002).

26

The five century span encompassing the time period between 1500 B.P.
and 1000 B.P. is known as “one of the most intriguing and important periods of
Southeastern prehistory” (Smith 1986:50). During the first three centuries of the
Late Woodland Period, the exotic and long distance trade regime that marked the
high point in cultural interaction during the Middle Woodland Period slowly
declined. This period is often referred to as the “Late Woodland decline” and
includes a more intra-regional and territorial focus rather than widespread interregional associations (Smith 1986; Nassaney and Cobb 1991; Johannessen
1993).
For the most part, cultural affiliation in the project area is attributed to the
Lower Mississippi Valley Baytown culture, which extends eastward from westcentral Mississippi to west-central and northwestern Alabama (Jenkins 1981;
Jenkins and Krause 1986). Baytown ceramics are characterized by small,
crushed pieces of pottery called grog that were used as a tempering agent.
Grog-tempered and sand-tempered wares recovered in the Pine Hills and include
mostly plain wares.
In the Chickasawhay Ranger District, Mulberry Creek Marked variety.
Tallahalla represents the bulk of recovered decorated ceramic types. Mulberry
Creek Cord Marked is generally taken as a chronological marker indicating an
early Late Woodland occupation and is often found in association with Collins
points manufactured from local Citronelle gravel (Reams 1995; Keith 1998;
Jackson et al. 1999; Jackson et al. 2002). At Tanya’s Knoll (22-Wa-642),
charred food residue scraped from Mulberry Creek Cord Marked variety
Tallahalla sherds produced a radiocarbon date of 1120± 50 B.P., placing this
ceramic type and associated artifacts firmly in the Late Woodland Period (Fields
2001b:99).
Ceramic assemblages from coastal areas of Mississippi also include a
minority of Weeden Island ceramics, possibly indicating influence and contact
from eastern populations (Jackson et al. 2002). Influence from the Tombigbee
drainage comes in the form of Miller III ceramics, which is characterized by
higher frequencies of grog tempering rather than sand. Common Miller III types
include, Mulberry Creek Cord Marked and Withers Fabric Marked (Jenkins and
Krause 1986).
Settlement and subsistence systems are believed to have remained
relatively intact from the previous period. Subsistence strategies followed the
traditional pattern of hunting, gathering, and possible supplemental gardening.
Settlements characterized as small, extended family households, were dispersed
across much of the landscape. In the Southeast, mobility patterns generally
consisted of residential base camps with increasing evidence of sedentism,
including substantial house structures and storage facilities. Base camps were
supplied and supplemented by logistical, special-purpose outings, possibly on a
seasonal basis (Steponaitis 1986:384).

27

Late Woodland Period components in the project area have mostly been
interpreted as either residential collector base camps or short-term, special
purpose sites for logistical collectors. Dunn (1999) interpreted Swamp Child (22Fo-666) as representing a short-term residential site for mobile foragers or a
possible special purpose site for logistically organized task groups. Dunn’s
research indicated that, during the Late Woodland Period occupation of the
Swamp Child site, occupants relied more heavily on an expedient core
technology, based on the high percentage of early stage flakes and shatter
dominated by local Citronelle gravel.
Moreover, evidence of rearmament, manufacture, and maintenance is
apparent in the presence of broken projectile point fragments and stems as well
as biface thinning and notching flakes. This possibly reflects a short-term
hunting site utilized by logistical task groups (Dunn 1999), which supports Keith’s
(1998) proposal that a logistically organized procurement strategy played a role
in the Pine Hills settlement adaptations during the Woodland Stage. Similarly, the
Late Woodland Period occupation at Tanya’s Knoll (22-Wa-642) in Wayne
County was interpreted as a special purpose hunting camp for logistically
organized hunter-gatherers (Fields 2001b).
The lithic assemblage was
dominated by expedient core reduction and a low diversity in formal stone tools,
most of which were likely used for the same purpose, illustrating the special
purpose nature of the site.
Phase II testing of The Chief Cato site (22-Fo-1023) in Forrest County has
provided documentation of the nature and type of lithic organization employed at
limited-use sites or short-term hunting stands located in an upland locale
(Jackson and Wright 2000). This site was excavated in 1999 by the University of
Southern Mississippi under contract with the Mississippi Department of
Transportation. Based on the limited number of diagnostics, the site was
occupied from the Late Archaic Period through the Late Woodland Period. Local
Citronelle gravel dominated the lithic assemblage. The site’s lithic remains were
characterized by a heavy emphasis on core reduction as reflected by a high
percentage of early stage flakes and shatter. One interesting observation
Jackson and Wright (2000) noted was the absence of cores, which indicates that
cores and unfinished bifaces were brought to the site. There, they were further
reduced, and then transported elsewhere.
This is to be expected at a limited use, short-term location such as the
Chief Cato site. The narrow range of activities reflected by the lithic assemblage
perhaps indicates the site was utilized by organized task groups as part of a
logistically organized system (Jackson and Wright 2000).

28

Mississippian Stage
After 1300 B.P., prehistoric groups in the Pine Hills area experienced
considerable shifts in cultural variations and innovations. Populations continued
to rise throughout various regions. Powerful politically active and religiously
motivated elite arose across much of the Southeast producing social and political
inequality within and between classes. Multi-mound centers were constructed
along major river valleys and basins and served as the central locus for powerful
religious political centers (Nassaney and Cobb 1991).
Major political centers are centered along major river floodplains,
presumably to accommodate the increased reliance on garden cultivation, which
also appeared during this time (Kelly 1990; Johannessen 1993:66; Smith 1986:
50-51). No mound centers are recorded for this area of southern Mississippi;
however, a number of large centers potentially served to influence populations in
the Pine HIlls. They include Bottle Creek in the Mobile River Delta (Brown and
Fuller 1993), Moundville on the Black Warrior River (Knight and Steponaitis
1998), and a number of smaller centers on the Mississippi Gulf Coast (Blitz and
Mann 2000).
At present, the Mississippian occupation of the Pine Hills is not well
defined. Mississippian sites in this area are predominantly recorded at the
survey level as a consequence of Section 106 activities; therefore, inferences
concerning settlement and site function are not available (Jackson 2001). The
majority of Mississippian sites are recognized on the basis of shell-tempered or
mixed grog-tempered and shell-tempered ceramics. Shell-tempered ceramics
are predominantly Mississippian Plain but also include decorated types such as
Moundville Incised, Pensacola Incised, Leland Incised, and shell-tempered, cordmarked varieties. Lithic diagnostics include Bayogoula Fishtailed and triangular
type Madison or Hamilton points (Jackson 2001).
Mississippian sites in the Pine Hills appear to represent limited occupation
camps or small farmsteads. Four Mississippian sites have been recorded along
terraces adjacent to the Leaf River near Hattiesburg. Only one of these, the
Sims site (22-Fo-582), has been excavated. The 2001 University of Southern
Mississippi field season conducted limited test excavations and revealed several
post mold stains and a dense midden accumulation below the plow zone.
Excavation revealed the post molds formed a roughly oval shaped pattern, about
three meters in width. This represents the first well-documented structure in the
Pine Hills (Jackson 2001). Future study is needed to determine the extent of
population and use of the Pine Hills during the Mississippian Stage.

29

Protohistoric Stage
Occupants of the Protohistoric Stage in southeast Mississippi are not well
documented archaeologically or ethnohistorically. However, Choctaw occupation
in central Mississippi is somewhat better defined and documented (Galloway
1996). By the time of the first European contact, major Indian groups (Mobile,
Biloxi, and Pascagoula) lived along the Mississippi Gulf Coast and the Lower
Mississippi Valley, which was inhabited by the Natchez. West of the Tombigbee
Watershed, ancestors or groups related to the historic Choctaw are believed to
have inhabited areas of the Pine Hills.
Historic Choctaw occupation is well documented north of the Pine Hills
along the headwaters of the Chickasawhay River, at least after the later half of
the 17th century. The Choctaw is the Protohistoric group that most likely
inhabited the current project area.
The exact origin of the Choctaw is unclear. Galloway (1996:342-343)
suggests that the Native American tribe known as Choctaw formed during
upheavals of the Protohistoric Stage. Additionally, archaeological evidence
suggests that the Choctaw settled in an area previously unpopulated by other
groups (Galloway 1996).
It is possible, as has been suggested by other researchers (Galloway
1996; Jackson 2001), that European disease and violence may have played a
role in the formation of the Choctaw. During the Mississippian Stage, the
archaeological record suggests that Native Americans shifted away from the
uplands and interior Pine Hills. Instead, large Chiefdoms arose along major
rivers including the Pearl, Black Warrior, Mobile, and Mississippi as well as along
the Mississippi Gulf Coast. After European contact, these groups were subject to
disease and war, possibly causing an amalgamation to occur across portions of
the Southeast. According to Galloway (1996), the first mention of the Choctaw
was near the end of the seventeenth century. At that time, they were residing in
a previously uninhabited area. Regardless of their origin, the Choctaw banded
together and proved to be a Native American tribe worth being allied with.
The first Choctaw and European contact occurred in 1699 with the
establishment of Louisiana by early French explorers. The Choctaw and French
forged a strong alliance resulting in almost seven decades of cooperation. The
alliance forged with the French provided additional protection against the
neighboring Chickasaw and Creek tribes that had a tendency to take slaves for
trade (Carleton 2002).

30

After the French lost possession of the Louisiana Territory east of the
Mississippi River to the English in 1763, the Choctaw were forced to redefine
their alliances. A short thirteen years later, the Choctaw would once again have
to deal with a new neighbor, the newly established United States of America
(Carleton 2002).
Historic Stage
Early Colonial Period
Beginning with Robert de la Salle, who first claimed the entire Mississippi
Valley in 1682, the French were the first occupiers of what was to become the
territory and state of Mississippi. In an effort to solidify their claim, the French
made plans to establish a new colony near the mouth of the Mississippi River.
The expedition lead by French war hero Pierre LeMoyne Sieur d’Iberville
settled in what is now Biloxi in 1699 and established what the French called the
Louisiana Colony. Eight years later; however, the mission was abandoned and
subsequently moved up the Mississippi River near present day Natchez (James
1968).
In 1716, the first French fort and trading post was established on the bluffs
overlooking the Mississippi River. The fort was named Fort Rosalie des Natchez.
At that time, the area was occupied by the Natchez Indians and included an area
some 25 fathoms long and 15 fathoms broad and enclosed by heavy palisade
fortifications. Six years later, Fort Rosalie was designated as the headquarters of
the newly organized Natchez District. For six years, the French traders and
missionaries were on shaky ground with the nearby Natchez Indians.
In 1723, the Natchez engaged in a four-day war with the French over the
death of a Natchez tribesman at the hands of a French trader. The Natchez
responded with attacks on French settlers as a means of satisfying their revenge.
The war ended with the French and Natchez agreeing to a peace settlement
proposed by the Natchez. However, peace ended shortly thereafter when Jean
Baptiste Bienville arrived in Natchez with 700 men and ordered an attack on the
nearby Natchez village. The attack ended in the death of an elder Natchez chief
(Wells 1994).
In 1729, the French commandant Sieur de Chepart demanded that the
Natchez evacuate one of their main villages that contained a sacred religious
mound in order to make room for new French farmsteads. At this point, the
Natchez conspired with the nearby Yazoo and Chickasaw bands to remove the
French presence from their lands. On November 28, 1729, the Natchez entered
Fort Rosalie under the auspices of borrowing guns to hunt, a practice that was
commonplace.

31

The Natchez took the settlers and soldiers by surprise and killed between
229 and 285 Frenchmen. Additionally, the Natchez took as many as 450 women
and slaves to be sold as reward to the British. Nearly a month later, the Yazoo
joined the Natchez in ridding their lands of French settlers and massacred
soldiers and settlers at Fort St. Peter (James 1968; Wells 1994).
The uprisings only increased the amount of French retribution. As
retaliation, the French allied themselves with the Choctaw Indians of central
Mississippi and attacked the Natchez a month later pursuing them into the
swamp lands of Mississippi. For two years, the French tried repeatedly to
capture the remaining Natchez tribesmen but where unsuccessful. Although a
handful of Natchez managed to escape, several hundred (including the Great
Sun or Natchez chief) were captured and sent to the island of Santo Domingo as
slaves. The last remaining Natchez dispersed and were absorbed into
surrounding tribes so that by 1743, Bienville reported that the Natchez nation
was totally destroyed (James 1968).
Although the Native American threat in Natchez had been removed by the
destruction of the Natchez Indians, the settlement was no longer the diamond the
French government had envisioned. Despite pleadings by Bienville for more
immigration and stronger fortification, the Natchez District ceased to function as
an administrative division and was relatively abandoned by 1751 (James 1968).
Toward the later part of the 18th century, the Seven Years’ War between
England and France was nearing an end. It was in 1762 that France, with great
reluctance, ceded the Louisiana territory west of the Mississippi and the Isle de
Orleans to the Spanish. The next year at the Paris Conference of 1763, the
French transferred the area east of the Mississippi to the British ending the
French control in Mississippi (Howell 1973; James 1968).
When Britain first took over what was to become Mississippi, their
northern boundary of claim was set at 31º. The British established their newly
won area as British West Florida in October of 1763. The same proclamation
created the provinces of East Florida, Quebec, and included the prohibition of
white settlement into the area north of the 31st parallel, which at this time was still
under Native American occupation. The British understood that expansion to the
north, if it was to occur, would be most beneficial along the Mississippi River.
The British saw the Choctaw and Chickasaw as more easily persuaded than the
more hostile Creek Indians located north of Pensacola, then the capital of British
West Florida (James 1968).

32

The original establishment of the 31st parallel as the northern boundary of
British West Florida did not include the Natchez area, a likely trade hub for the
English and their Spanish neighbors to the west across the Mississippi River. In
1764, Governor George Johnstone of West Florida requested the Board of Trade
issue a supplementary commission that would authorize the extension of British
West Florida northward to 32º 28´ which would include Natchez. Johnstone later
negotiated a treaty with the Choctaw so that this new line would be recognized
as the official boundary (James 1968).
As a result of English rule, colonial growth in the Mississippi region was
encouraged with benefits offered to potential settlers. These benefits included
free land grants, enough rations for the colonist to survive until they were able to
be self sufficient, and transportation to the colony. Although these actions did
encourage some growth within the area, even the larger towns in British West
Florida were, as Kynerd (1973:154) describes them, “little more than small
frontier villages.” By 1768, difficulties getting supplies, settlers, and defensive
soldiers to the isolated Fort Panmure (formally Fort Rosalie) got the best of
British West Florida, and General Thomas Gage ordered the fort to be closed
along with several others along the overland trail (James 1968). Despite this
closure, some additional growth occurred in the area by way of large land grants
and increased advertisement.
The British rule of the Mississippi area came to an abrupt end in 1779.
The Spanish had joined forces with the French in their war against Britain. This
war caused a great amount of alarm in British West Florida, and the British
(fearing an attack was inevitable) began to prepare. The British efforts were not
enough to overcome the large Spanish force, and the British were defeated in
Baton Rouge. On September 21, 1779, the British surrendered British West
Florida to Spanish control (Kynerd 1973).
Although the Spanish controlled the Natchez district, they did not make up
the majority of the population. Most of the settlers were former Americans who
migrated into the district following the American Revolution. The Spanish
government offered these settlers land grants as well as other economic
freedoms not allowed in the United States. The Spanish government also
required loyalty oaths to be sworn of all the new settlers in the district for fear of a
plot to overthrow the Spanish rule.
A 1784 census reported that 1619 people were residing within the
Natchez district. In eight years, the population had increased to 4346. The lure of
tobacco as a cash crop played a large part in this population boom, as did the
Spanish offer of additional land grants for settlers who owned slaves. Spanish
control of New Orleans as a successful market and distribution center also
played a role in attracting a large number of colonists to Natchez.

33

With the signing of the treaty of San Lorenzo on October 27, 1795, the
entirety of Spanish colonial lands above the 31st parallel came under the control
of the United States. The transition was accelerated by an attempted uprising of
American settlers within the Natchez District, which pressured the Spanish to
finally evacuate the area on March 30, 1798 (Holmes 1973). Shortly thereafter,
the area would be formally organized into the Mississippi Territory.
Territorial Period
During the early Colonial Period of Mississippi, the flags of three different
nations flew over the area. France, Spain, and Great Britain each ruled the area
that would become first the territory then the state of Mississippi. After the United
States gained full control of the Natchez District, a treaty was signed between the
United States government and the local Native American population in order to
secure the safety of the American settlers within the area and any future settlers
that may arrive in the Mississippi Territory.
The Treaty of Fort Adams, signed on December 17, 1801, marks the
second land treaty signed by the Choctaw with the United States Government.
This treaty also marked the beginning of Choctaw removal in the Mississippi
Territory. The Fort Adams treaty ceded 2,641,920 acres of land, in exchange for
$2,000.00 and blacksmith tools to the United States Government. In addition to
the ceded lands, the Choctaw also agreed to allow the construction of the
Natchez Trace through their territory providing a route for future expansion into
the territory (Guice 1985; Ferguson 1985).
With the formation of the Mississippi territory and several land cession
treaties, the great migration flood began. By 1810, the Mississippi Territory
reportedly contained some 15,000 white inhabitants and roughly 13,000 slaves.
Although migration into the Mississippi territory was steady prior to the War of
1812, post-war migration, beginning in 1815, saw a dramatic influx of immigrants
into the area. This period is referred to as the “Great Migration.” The population
in what would become the state of Mississippi doubled between the years 1810
and 1820. Additionally, that part of the Mississippi Territory that would become
Alabama increased also, more than sixteen fold (Guice and Clark 1989).
By 1810, three primary areas of settlement were noted for the Mississippi
Territory. These included the Lower Mississippi Valley, the lower Tombigbee
River, and the elbow of the Tennessee River. Because the areas were spread
apart by distance, there was great difficulty for early territorial governors in their
early efforts at organization. The occupants within each area felt the strain of
isolation thus creating feelings of insecurity and neglect. The vast size and
settlement distribution of the Mississippi Territory (containing both present day
Mississippi and Alabama) created its own deterrent to the possibility of future
statehood.

34

Between 1811 and 1816, the territorial legislature and Congress went
back and forth with the idea of statehood. Not until 1817, was the issue finally
resolved. In early 1817, President James Madison signed an act passed by
Congress that enabled the residents of the western part of the territory to write a
constitution in anticipation of impending statehood. Two days later, the counties
located in the eastern part of the territory were reorganized into the Alabama
Territory (Guice and Clark 1989).
Voters in the Mississippi Territory chose forty-eight delegates to write the
state’s constitution, which was adopted on August 17, 1817. The voters did not
approve the document. Instead, it was sent directly to President James Madison
for approval. In September of that year the voters elected their first Governor
(David Holmes) and their first Lieutenant Governor (Duncan Stewart). Mississippi
officially became the 20th state when President Monroe signed a resolution of
admission on December 10, 1817 (Haynes 1973).
Early Statehood
Since the Natchez District and the newly organized state were flourishing
with incoming immigrants and new trade, the United States Government believed
that they needed to expand their land holdings in Mississippi. The Treaty of
Doaks Stand in 1820 was a land treaty by which the United States sought to
obtain land from the Choctaw in Mississippi in exchange for land in Oklahoma.
The Choctaws were initially suspicious of the land offer, considering that the land
might not be as valuable as the land they occupied in Mississippi.
The treaty commissioners, Andrew Jackson and Thomas Hinds, soon
allayed their fears, and the Choctaws signed the Treaty of Doaks Stand on
September 20th, 1820, which ceded six million acres of land predominantly
located within the Mississippi Delta to the United States (American State Papers
n.d. 241). The effect of the treaty was a land rush of Euro-Americans into the
newly acquired fertile delta area. There still remained a relatively large portion of
land in northwestern and east central Mississippi still inhabited by the Choctaw.
In an effort to rid the state of Mississippi of all Choctaw Indians, a treaty was
formulated and taken to the Dancing Rabbit council of the Choctaw Nation.
Although many chiefs were not willing to sign over lands and move to Oklahoma,
the commissioners secretly held meetings with some of the chiefs promising
generous land grants and life annuity. The tactics worked, and the Treaty of
Dancing Rabbit Creek was signed by the Choctaw on September 27, 1830. This
treaty proclaimed that the Choctaw Nation ceded the remainder of the country
they owned and possessed east of the Mississippi river and remove themselves
as quickly as possible to Indian lands west of the Mississippi (Guice and Clark
1989).

35

These treaties made available vast areas of fertile delta lands, and cotton
became Mississippi’s staple crop after statehood. The introduction of a Mexican
variety of cotton with larger bolls in 1820 revolutionized the cotton industry in the
South. Corn was also an important crop in antebellum Mississippi that is often
overlooked. It was the most important food crop grown in the state and was used
to feed people and livestock (Scarborough 1973).
In the decades before the Civil War, Mississippi experienced its most
prosperous years. Most farmers owned their own land, and many owned slaves.
The success of the market in Mississippi and the South grew until its climax in
the year 1836 in which more than one million acres of cotton were planted in the
state. This was followed by the Panic of 1837, a depression that lasted two
years. The depression forced the South to diversify its crops and also led to
many new innovations in farming methods. Mississippi began to recover from the
Panic of 1837 in the mid-1840s. During the 1850s, the prices of land and slaves
rose sharply, reflecting the success of the Southern economy. By 1860, the total
value of Mississippi’s slave property was estimated to be $350,000,000
(Scarborough 1973).
The introduction of railroads as a fast way to exchange and deliver goods
served to make or break small towns that before had relied on river traffic for
survival. The first railroad to begin construction in Mississippi was the West
Feliciana Railroad Company line between Woodville, Mississippi and St.
Francisville, Louisiana in 1831 (Fortune 1973). The line began service in the
summer of 1836 (Gonzales 1973). Other railroads were still being built when the
Panic of 1837 hit all construction was halted (Fortune 1973).
A total of twenty-three charters had been granted to railroad companies
between 1831 and 1839, but only 83 miles of track had been completed by 1840
due to the panic. In 1840, a track between Jackson and Vicksburg was
completed, a distance of forty-seven miles (Gonzales 1973).
The Civil War and Reconstruction
The Civil War was the beginning of a string of social, political, and
economic changes for Mississippi. The War itself was fought on many different
fronts and involved people at every social level. The Civil War has come to
symbolize America’s first realization that human beings are just that, and
capitalistic economic reasons are not strong enough to hold people in slavery.

36

While the North was economically dependent on industry, the South relied
on agriculture to maintain the elite portion of the population. When the economics
were threatened by legislation, the South reacted violently declaring that issues
such as slavery and other economic concerns should be handled at the state
level. Following this debate, the southern states of the United States succeeded
in declaring themselves as an independent nation, and this prompted a battle to
maintain the Union.
The control of the Mississippi River brought the Civil War to Mississippi.
The Mississippi River served as a major waterway highway for the South as well
as the North. The closing of the waterway by Confederate troops to Union
merchant traffic was enough to threaten the economic survival of the North.
Lincoln saw the situation as detrimental to the survival of the Union’s supply
traffic. He therefore identified Vicksburg as the key to victory in re-opening the
Mississippi River and breaking the backbone of the Confederacy.
The City of Vicksburg was heavily guarded and fortified on the bluffs
overlooking the Mississippi River. After a few attempts at invading and defeating
the city of Vicksburg from the river and the north, General Ulysses S. Grant
changed his strategy. He decided that trying to invade Vicksburg from the North
would be fruitless because of the mobility of the Confederate army in transferring
troops from Jackson to any point of conflict using rail lines. He also determined
that invading Vicksburg directly from the river would be suicide for his troops.
These dilemmas left him with one option, to move south of Vicksburg and isolate
the city.
On the night of April 30th, 1863 and early morning of May 1, 1863, Grant
moved his men into Mississippi at Bruinsburg. He then marched northeast toward
Jackson to cut the railroad network at its hub. On May 1st the Battle of Port
Gibson was fought with a Union victory, and on May 12th the Battle of Raymond
was fought leaving the path open for the capture of Jackson.
Under the orders of General J. C. Pemberton, Brigadier General John
Gregg brought a brigade of about 4000 men to face the Union army that was
quickly advancing on Jackson. These two armies met a few miles from the town
of Raymond on May 12, 1863. Gregg was under the assumption that the
advancing Union troops were a small group of marauders, but soon found out
that they were the main attacking body of the advancing army (Winschel 1999;
Foote 1963).

37

The Confederate army held up well, but soon found that they were vastly
outnumbered and decided that a retreat was in order. The final toll of Gregg’s
mistake was 514 casualties, compared to the Union army’s 442. The Battle of
Raymond separated Gregg from Pemberton preventing reinforcement and also
turned Grant’s attention to the city of Jackson (Foote 1963:33). To ensure
reinforcements did not hinder his approach to Vicksburg, Grant destroyed
Jackson and reduced the capital city to chimneys.
Once Jackson was captured and burned, no hope was left for the city of
Vicksburg. With no supplies or reinforcements available it was only a matter of
Grant applying military pressure and waiting. Vicksburg’s defeat on July 4th 1863
sounded the re-opening of the Mississippi River to the Union Army and the death
of the Confederacy (Winschel 1999).
The fact that the Civil War had been fought mainly in the South left
physical and fiscal destruction in Mississippi at the war’s end. It is estimated that
one fourth of the white males fifteen years old and older died during the war
(Harris 1967). Most of Mississippi’s major cities and economic centers had been
completely destroyed. The railroads connecting the cities to each other had
been torn up, and what the hands of the Union army had not touched had mostly
wasted away in the four years of abandonment during the war by the
Confederate men.
As the means of production within the agrarian labor system had
completely collapsed with the freeing of the slaves, economic destitution was at
hand in Mississippi. The lack of able-bodied men due to injuries during the war to
help with restoring economic stability led to a selling of large plantations and an
influx of northern speculators, usually Union veterans who (while serving in
Mississippi) noticed that large amounts of money could be made in agriculture.
Speculators could also rent a percentage of crops, which brought in enough
capital so that southern planters could plant an economically viable sized crop.
However, the most common way to overcome the agricultural capital/labor
problem was with the “share” system. In the sharecropping system the plantation
owner would supply the laborer, usually a freedman, the land, and all the
supplies necessary to plant. In return, the laborer would be responsible for
growing and cultivating the crop and (in the end) a payment of an agreed upon
percentage (usually one-half, of the crop) would go to both the laborer and the
plantation owner (Garner 1901).

38

The system of sharecropping became a way to replace plantation farming.
Willis (2000) offers several reasons that the sharecropping system was attractive
to desolate landowners. First, it removed the landowners from direct supervision
of the workers. Secondly, it split the financial risk of planting between landlords
and laborers. Willis also reports that sharecropping was a system attractive to
freedmen after Reconstruction. The risk associated with producing a good crop
was low, especially in the Delta region. Despite the common belief that
sharecroppers were constantly indebted to their landowners, Willis (2000) and
Ownby (1999) claim that most sharecroppers managed to avoid debt. Willis says
that sharecropping did not become synonymous with “inescapable poverty” until
after 1900. Problems arose with sharecropping in the late 1860s when cotton
prices began to fall. Each year a larger crop was needed for the landlord to break
even, and the tenants were sometimes blamed and penalized for a bad crop
(Willis 2000).
Several railroads were completed just prior to the beginning of the Civil
War. However, most railroad lines incurred severe damage during the years of
the war. During Reconstruction, the federal government offered materials and
equipment for railroad construction to the southern railroad companies on credit
at high prices. All Mississippi railroads except the Southern Railroad Company
took advantage of this offer. The government rebuilt the Southern railroad track
between Jackson and Vicksburg as a means of moving troops and equipment.
The railroads that were able to recover after the war include the New Orleans,
Jackson, and Great Northern Railroad, the Mississippi Central Railroad, the
Mississippi and Tennessee Railroad, the Southern Railroad, and the Mobile and
Ohio Railroad (Harris 1967).
With economic stability, slowly returning political stability and a desired
restoration of Mississippi’s “former position in the Union” (House Reports, 39th
Congress, 1st Session n.d.) came to the forefront. President Johnson’s home rule
policy of reconstruction and his desire not to alter the “fundamental political
structure of the state” (Harris 1967:228) eased many Mississippian’s minds about
reincorporating into the United States. The largest political issue facing
Mississippi was the change to the political structure brought on by the Thirteenth
and Fourteenth amendments. Believing there was room for argument, Mississippi
subsequently rejected these amendments, thus ending Johnson’s soft policies
and began the harsh congressional imposition of these amendments by military
force. After this time, Mississippi was left to its own devises to make a recovery
which was slow in coming and not fully realized until the end of World War II
(Harris 1967).

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF PROJECT AREA
The Lumber Industry in Southeast and Central Mississippi
The tending and utilization of pine and hardwood forests is not a new
endeavor. Since the first European explorers set foot along the coast and
ventured into the piney woods uplands, timber has played an important role in
the economic system of Mississippi. Early French explorers harvested Longleaf
pine and various oaks in order to construct ship masts, yards, spars and the early
forts and structures that went along with colonization (Napier 1985). Although
lumbering was a necessity during the early Colonial Period, it wasn’t until after
the Civil War that the timber industry became an economic boom for southeast
and central Mississippi.
Southeast and central Mississippi were perched on the edge of the timber
landslide of the late 1800s. As early as 1850, state geologists recognized the
importance of the Longleaf pine (Napier 1985). After the Civil War and during the
infancy of reconstruction, the South was so strongly hit that it was doubtful that
the economy could rebound. The answer was lumber. Because so much of the
South had been destroyed, including homes, business, railroads, and even whole
towns and cities, there arose a need for lumber and southeast and central
Mississippi were ready and able to answer the call.
As a necessity, timbering became a major livelihood in southeast and
central Mississippi in the late 1800s and during the early part of the 20th century.
Because railways were seriously damaged during the Civil War, alternate means
of transportation were needed to transport the timber in the early period of
lumbering. Major water routes became the staple with virgin Longleaf pine trees
felled and then floated down the Pearl, Leaf, Chickasawhay, and Pascagoula
rivers to lumber mills along the Gulf Coast (Napier 1985). Logs were bound
together and floated as mini barges. Loggers that accompanied the log barges
down river to the mill destination used pirogues. In the early 1990s, a wooden
pirogue raft was excavated by the University of Southern Mississippi from the
Leaf River just outside of Hattiesburg. It is likely the pirogue may have been
used during the early logging industry in southeast Mississippi.
As the lumber industry expanded, so did the mills. Lumber mills sprang
up throughout southeast Mississippi along major rivers and, with the coming of
rail, easy transportation made the lumber industry a gold mine. Additionally, the
arrival of the railway system coincided with the replacement of the double bladed
axe with that of the crosscut saw. The introduction of railroads and the crosscut
saw made possible the large-scale market of virgin Longleaf pine.

40

In 1883, the first railroad was completed through the area. The New
Orleans & Northeastern extended from New Orleans to Meridian and marked the
beginning of major commercialization of lumber in the area (Hoffman 1998). As
railroad lines spread across southeast and central Mississippi, sawmill towns and
communities were founded and flourished along major railways. By 1890, 22
Longleaf pine mills were in operation along the New Orleans & Northeastern,
including mills in Hattiesburg, Purvis, and Lumberton.
Soon, other railroads were constructed in the area. At first, they included
the Gulf & Ship Island that ran from Gulfport to Hattiesburg. Later, they extended
farther north. By late 1900, nearly 35 Longleaf pine mills were in operation along
the Gulf & Ship Island. In 1904, two more railroads were constructed, the Mobile,
Jackson & Kansas City and the Mississippi Central. These two lines entered
Hattiesburg from the east and west and created a hub from which the lumber
industry flourished. As a result, Hattiesburg rapidly expanded from a tiny mill
settlement in 1884 to a major city by 1905 (Hoffman 1998).
Mills were supplied by the major railroad lines that stretched into vast
acres of virgin Longleaf pine. Longleaf pine trees were felled and skidded by
oxen drawn teams to the main line. As timber surrounding the main line was cut,
new temporary spurs or lateral roads were constructed to the main line. These
spurs were often called “dummy lines” because of their temporary use and the
fact they went nowhere (Hoffman 1998:viii). These logging lines were operated
by the small, Shay steam locomotives and became the driving force for the
logging industry in southeast and central Mississippi. Small logging camps were
often set up in the middle of large tracts of Longleaf pine. There, the logging
crews lived their day-to-day life. Although during this period in history, jobs were
separated by segregation, both African-American and Anglo-Americans were
able to earn a living working in the woods. Large Longleaf pine trees were felled
and loaded onto the eight-wheeled Lindsey wagons drawn by teams of oxen. At
these temporary camps, earthen embankments were constructed adjacent to the
rail line for log loading creating a series of loading ramps paralleling the rail line
(Hoffman 1998). Once an area was cleared, the crew moved on to a new parcel
of land and the process began again.
The lumber industry flourished for nearly five decades. By 1920, however,
only the larger mills were left in operation mainly as a result of business panics
and the slump that accompanied World War I. The diminishing forests also
played a role in the demise of the smaller mills. As the mills faded into history, so
too did the small towns that sprang up around the mills. Many simply became
ghost towns while others retained their name as a community within their county.

41

Evidence of forest and lumber activities can be found throughout the
project area. The area is riddled with skidder trails and deep plowed fire lines
between compartments and stands. Additionally, early logging dummy lines, rail
spurs, and loading berms as well as abandoned logging camps are likely to be
found scattered throughout the Bienville National Forest.
Historical Overview of the United States Forest Service
The USFS in general is considered the steward of over 200 million acres
of public lands nation wide. It is responsible for the management of natural as
well as cultural resources within its jurisdiction. These resources include public
recreation, timber management, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat and
restoration, and the focus of this investigation - cultural resources.
Overwhelmingly, the natural resource most utilized and managed by the
USFS is timber. The USFS is charged with prescribing the type of timber harvest,
treatment of timber stands to improve growth, timber harvest sales and
preparation, and re-establishing new forest growth after harvest has been
completed. By tending to the growing forest, the USFS not only caters to the
growth of new and old trees, but it also enhances and encourages other natural
resources to grow and flourish in their natural environment. These resources
include several threatened and endangered wildlife and plant species.
The history of the USFS began in 1876 when Congress appointed Dr.
Franklin B. Hough as the first forestry agent for the United States Federal
Government. He was assigned to the Department of Agriculture and was
presented with the task of compiling a statistical inquiry on the present conditions
of forests located in the United States. The result of Hough’s study, Report on
Forestry (1878-1884) by West (1992) presented a call for the management of
Federal timber lands, the creation of Federal Forest experiment stations and
reserves, the implementation of tree planting, and public education on forest
conservation, thus paving the way for the Forest Reserve Act of 1891.
On March 3, 1891, President Benjamin Harrison signed the Forest
Reserve Act. This act was the accumulation of nearly two decades of debate by
Congress on public land policy and timber management practices (West 1992).
Fourteen years later on February 1, 1905, Congress formally transferred
the administration of the Federal forest reserves from the Department of the
Interior’s General Land Office to that of the Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of
Forestry. A month later on March 3, the Bureau of Forestry became the USFS.
Two years later, all Federal forest reserve lands formally were renamed National
Forests (West 1992).

42

After the formation of the USFS, forest reserves across the country were
set aside for the purpose of establishing National Forests. While the West was
one of the last frontiers to be populated and still maintained, a vast amount of
lands that could be set aside from the public domain and most of the forest lands
within Mississippi were already within the hands of private individuals. The
upside is that much of the lands had already been farmed out or were barren
cutovers after the great timber rush of the late 19th century and early 20th century
and could be purchased from the landowner for little to nothing because of high
tax debts. These lands were ideal for the reestablishment of longleaf timber and
conservation efforts (Fickle 2001).
In 1924, the Clarke-McNary Act was passed as a way for the United
States Government to purchase land for the conservation of natural resources.
At that time, Mississippi Senator Pat Harrison, Chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, facilitated the security of 50 million dollars to be used for the
purchase of private lands within the state of Mississippi. The lands were to be
used to set up the National Forest system in Mississippi. Among those
established with the initial land purchasing are the Homochitto, Bienville, De
Soto, Holly Springs, and Delta National Forests (Fickle 2001).
The Bienville National Forest is one of six National Forests that make up
the National Forests of Mississippi. It was established in 1934 in an effort to reestablish forests over extensive cutover areas in central Mississippi. At first, it
was divided into two ranger districts, Strong River and Bienville. This National
Forest was named in honor of the 18th century French-Canadian colonist and
soldier Jean Baptiste Bienville the founder of Mobile, New Orleans, and the
previously discussed French fort City of Natchez (Fickle 2001).
Smith County Historical Review
Established on December 23, 1833, Smith County is located in the southcentral part Mississippi. Smith County was named for Major David Smith, a
Revolutionary War soldier from Hinds County. It was created from the last of the
Choctaw Cession lands taken over under the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creak on
September 27, 1830. In addition to Smith County, seventeen additional counties
were created from Choctaw lands (Brieger 1980; Murray 2000).
At the time of formation, the county seat was located at Fairfield, a small
settlement just south of Raleigh, the present day county seat. In 1835, Raleigh
(formally known as Indian Springs) was formed and later incorporated in 1838.
That year the county seat was moved from Fairfield to Raleigh.

43

Legend has it that Raleigh was named in honor of Sir Walter Raleigh, an
English Military and Naval Commander (Brieger 1980); however, descendants of
E. N. Pittman, an early settler of Smith County, claim that he was selected to
name the new town at which point Pittman suggested Raleigh after Raleigh,
North Carolina from which he had moved. Like many early towns and settlements
in the Southeast, the courthouse burned a number of times, permanently
removing valuable historical documentation. The current courthouse is the fourth
erected in Raleigh and was built in 1912 (Brieger 1980).
In addition to Raleigh, a number of small crossroad settlements and
communities are located within or adjacent to the project area. Crossroad
settlements and communities within or adjacent to the project area are
summarized in the following synopsis.
Burns
Burns is a small crossroad settlement located nine miles northwest of
Raleigh. The actual establishment of Burns dates to 1809 when Matthew Burns,
a settler from North Carolina, purchased a home site from M. S. Roberts. Robert
Burns, a relative of Matthew Burns, joined him later and established the first store
and served as postmaster. The early settlers applied for a post office that was
formally opened in 1865. At the same time two churches were organized, the old
Sharon Baptist Church and the Lutheran Church (Brieger 1980:643).
Daniel
Daniel, a small settlement located just south of Burns, was established in
1860. The settlement was named after James Daniel who owned and operated a
cotton gin. With the operation of the cotton gin, Daniel grew to a population of
approximately 200 in 1875; however, the local school was annexed to the White
Oak community in 1916, and Daniel became only a name (Brieger 1980:644).
Lemon
Lemon was a fairly sizeable community in 1890. It was located four miles
east of Burns and was founded by Tom Hegwood, Wesley Hegwood, and John
Glaze. Together, the three men built the first store (operated by Tom Hegwood)
and the first gin and gristmill (operated by Wesley Hegwood and John Glaze). In
1902, Wesket Hegwood and John Glaze also built a sawmill for the budding
lumber industry. A single church called Goodwater was constructed in 1866.
That same year, the first school was taught under the direction of A. J. Stennett.
In 1939, the post office was abolished for Rural Free Delivery from Forest. At
that time, the community consisted of one store, a gristmill, a Masonic hall, a
church, and a school (Brieger 1980:646).

44

Lingle
Lingle was founded in 1898 as a post office on the Raleigh-Forest Road.
A. R. Lingle served as the first postmaster with the office serving as the
exchange point between Forest and Raleigh. The post office was closed in 1938
(Brieger 1980:646).
Lorena
Lorena, located twelve miles southwest of Forest, was founded and
named in 1888. Lorena was named after the postmaster’s sister, Lorena
Moulder. Lorena was nothing more than a small farming settlement. Of interest
was the well of D. W. Moulder. It was reported that the well was curbed with
tiling with a shelter constructed over it and a cement horse-trough beside it
(Brieger 1980:646).
Polkville
Polkville, located ten miles south of Morton, was first settled by four
different families. They include the Dulmore, Bradshaw, Craft, and Baugh
families. The settlement was founded around 1834. In 1846, a Methodist church
was constructed near the original settlers homes (Brieger 1980:649).
Shongelo
Shongelo, named for the Shongelo Creek and located four miles north of
Raleigh, was organized in 1865. Between 1865 and 1909, the population rose to
nearly 200 and included two gristmills, two cotton gins, a sawmill, general store,
and post office. Like many early logging towns, Shongelo ceased to exist after
the lumbering industry receded in 1919 (Brieger 1980:649).
Traxler
Traxler was officially founded in 1897 when J .R. Traxler secured a post
office for the settlement. Although Traxler was officially founded in 1897, the
area was inhabited as far back as 1821 when Dick Womack built the first house
in the area. J R. Traxler later purchased the same property and constructed a
new home and built a general store at the location (Brieger 1980:651).

45

Trenton
Trenton, first established in 1841 and located five miles northwest of
Burns, was founded as one of the first settlements in Smith County. First settlers
included the Limbaugh, Little, Thomas, Summers, Kinard, Switenburg, Howie,
and Broadfoot families. Many of these first settlers came from South Carolina
and were originally Dutch immigrants. As a result, Trenton was first known as
“Dutch Colony.” The settlement consisted of a mercantile store, a post office
(first used in 1870), and a private school. The school was in use until 1945 when
the community was consolidated and the students sent to Burns (Brieger
1980:651).
White Oak
No date or information is given for this small cross road community.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
There are 250 previously recorded prehistoric and historic sites in the
current project area. Of this number, 225 have official site numbers issued by
the office of the SHPO (Appendix II), while the remaining 25 are identified by field
numbers assigned by the USFS (Appendix III). Since this study is only
concerned with sites on lands belonging to the USFS and some sites have been
recorded on private property, the actual number of sites within the boundaries of
the project area is greater. The sample in the project area consists of 198
prehistoric sites and 49 historic sites. Some of these sites contain prehistoric and
historic components. There are no data for the age of sites 22-Sm-509, 96-243BV-15H, and BV-276-1.
Most of the previous work in the Bienville National Forest has been
conducted by USFS archaeologists. These surveys are usually conducted prior
to timber sales, construction projects for recreational projects, and natural
disasters such as the recent Hurricane Katrina. The background check identified
33 surveys within the current project area dating from 1989 through 2003. No
reports for the years 1990, 1999, 2001, and 2002 were found during the
background check. A listing of reports on file at MDAH appears in Appendix IV to
this report. This listing is in chronological order by author and notes sites in the
project area recorded or revisited during these investigations. USFS personnel
performed twenty-five of these projects, while the remaining eight were carried
out by private contract archaeological firms. Private contractors work in the
forest mainly in relation to oil and gas activities such as well pads. Large-scale
projects such as the current seismic survey are rare.
There are 37 previously recorded sites in the current project area with
state numbers that are planned for avoidance during the current seismic survey
(Appendix V). According to the site cards on file at MDAH, the eligibility of 36 of
these sites is unknown in terms of listing in the NRHP. One site (22-Sm-1130) is
described on the site card as eligible for listing in the NRHP. The eligibility of one
site identified by a USFS field number (96-243-BV-16H) is also unknown (see
Appendix III). The USFS uses different terminology when describing site
eligibility. According to this agency, there are three classes of sites. These are
Class I (eligible), Class II (potentially eligible), and Class III (ineligible).
Descriptions of these sites are presented in the following section (Sites Selected
for Avoidance). A listing of those sites with state numbers in the project area with
report references (MDAH, USFS, and private contractors) is presented in
Appendix VI. A listing of those sites with USFS numbers in the project area with
report references is presented in Appendix VII.

47

The data used to compile this section came from site cards on file at
MDAH and reports on file at MDAH and the USFS, Bienville Ranger District, plus
personal communication with David Abbott, Pam Edwards, Rita D. Fields, and
Terry L. McClung. These data were entered into an Excel Worksheet and sorted
by eight pre-determined categories: age of site, elevation of site, landform, depth,
percent of disturbance, presence or absence of prehistoric ceramics, presence or
absence of stone tools (e.g., projectile points, bifaces, unifaces, and utilized
flakes), and sites with debitage only (no formal tools or ceramics present). Many
of the site cards are lacking critical information. In these instances, the reports (if
available) were checked for the missing data. Sometimes important site data
were simply not available. It was not always clear from the site cards and reports
if shovel testing was conducted. Prehistoric sites within the forest with diagnostic
artifacts date to the Paleoindian Stage (n=1), Archaic Stage (n=8), Woodland
Stage (n=97), and Mississippian Stage (n=1). No sites were identified as dating
to the Protohistoric or Historic Indian periods. Sites lacking datable artifacts are
classified as Unknown Prehistoric. They number 116. There are no data for two
sites.
Prehistoric sites in the Bienville National Forest are located on a variety of
landforms. These are knolls on terraces (n=21), the first terrace above a stream
(n=33), the second terrace above a stream (n=17), the third terrace above a
stream (n=4), the fourth terrace above a stream (n=3), the fifth terrace above a
stream (n=1), upland ridges (n=161), ridges (n=3), floodplains (n=3), and bluffs
(n=2). There are three site cards for which no landform data are present. No
sites are present in the project area on the other landforms listed on the site card
(e.g., estuary, natural levee, backswamp, bluff shelter, chenier, or dune).
Although the site card does not list any terrace except the first as a landform
choice, some archaeologists have listed sites on second, third, fourth, and fifth
terraces (see above).
The vast majority of the 250 sites in the project area are restricted to the
surface or artifacts found in shallow soils. Surface sites account for 88 of the
total, and sites described as being restricted to 30 cm or less number 145. Five
sites were found to be between 30 and 50 cm. The deepest sites in the project
area are 22-Sm-573 at 70 cm and 22-Sm-712 at 60 cm. The exact depth for 12
sites is not given on the site cards.
The elevation of the sites varies from 300 feet above mean sea level to
600 feet above mean sea level. The majority of sites are between 351 and 450
feet above mean sea level. One site is described as being between 300 and 350
feet, 78 sites are described as being between 351 and 400 feet, 125 sites are
described as being between 401 and 450 feet, 42 sites are described as being
between 451 and 500 feet, 3 sites are described as being between 501 and 550
feet, and 3 sites are described as being between 551 and 600 feet.

Site disturbance consists of logging and related activities within the forest,
construction projects by the USFS, and the result of natural disasters such as
Hurricane Katrina. The amount of disturbance present has been grouped into
light (0%-30%), medium (35%-70%) and heavy (75%-100%). According to the
data on the site cards, there are 63 sites (25%) classified as being lightly
disturbed, 51 sites (20%) classified as being medium disturbed, and 132 (53%)
sites classified as being heavily disturbed. At the extreme ends of this scale, 44
sites have disturbance of 10% or less, and 29 sites have disturbance of 100%.
Disturbance is not known for four sites. Appendix VIII depicts the disturbance for
the site sample in 5% increments.
The major artifact types found at the prehistoric sites include ceramics and
stone tools. Ceramics are present at 82 sites, and stone tools are present at 67
sites. At 90 sites, only debitage was found. Prehistoric sites in the project area
consist of seasonal residential base camps, temporary special use camps, shortterm base camps, and isolated finds of single artifacts. No earthen mounds have
been reported.
There are 30 historic sites in the project area. Eighteen of these were
recorded as a historic component of a prehistoric site, and the remaining 12 are
solely historic. The vast majority of these date to the early to middle part of the
20th century. Most of these sites are farmsteads or isolated features such as
dipping vats or stock tanks. Numerous cemeteries are present in the area;
however, not one of these has received a MDAH site number.

49

METHODS
The majority of the methods followed during this Phase I archaeological
survey were designed after consultation with the USFS, Bienville Ranger District,
a review of the Guidelines for Archaeological Investigations and Reports in
Mississippi prepared by Douglas C. Sims of MDAH, and input from the Project
Archaeologist. The following narrative discusses the pre-field methods, field
methods, avoidance plans and monitoring activities, and curation.
Pre-Field Methods
Prior to commencement of the archaeological investigation, the Principal
Investigator, Project Archaeologist, and Regional Specialist performed several
tasks. These included preparing a Research Design that justified the legitimacy
of the proposed fieldwork and the techniques to be employed. This document
also specifies the size of the area to be examined and the reason for the survey.
This document was compiled with assistance from DESCO and Terry L. McClung
at the USFS. It was submitted with vitae for the Principal Investigator, Project
Archaeologist, and Assistant Project Archaeologist for approval by the USFS and
MDAH. Approval and/or comment from the SHPO are required for all projects of
500 acres or more.
The Principal Investigator traveled to Jackson, Mississippi and conducted
background research at MDAH. The Regional Specialist and an assistant aided
him in this task. The main purpose of this task was to identify the presence of
significant archaeological sites (prehistoric and historic) within the current project
area. In order to better understand the nature of the cultural resources present,
data for all sites within the project area were collected. Sites within the
boundaries of the Bienville National Forest under private ownership were not
included in the database. The site data used in this survey were obtained from a
thorough review of site cards, archaeological reports, and relevant topographic
quadrangles on file at the office of the SHPO and USFS, Bienville Ranger
District.
In addition, the Principal Investigator and Project Archaeologist
discussed the project with personnel from these agencies as well as other
archaeologists with knowledge of the area.
The data obtained from the above-mentioned sources were used to
compile lists and a database that was used to predict the kinds of sites that are
present in the project area and to present an overview of past work. The
database contained several criteria that were used to discuss the overall
archaeological potential of the project area such as the number of prehistoric and
historic sites, specific age data (i.e., Paleoindian, Archaic, Woodland, etc.), the
landforms on which the prehistoric sites are located, degree of disturbance for all
sites, and kinds of artifacts present. These data were entered on an Excel
Worksheet and sorted.

50

The Project Archaeologist prepared for the survey by attending a meeting
in Forest, Mississippi with representatives of Jurassic Operations, DESCO, and
the USFS. He also created a Field Procedure Manual and special forms to be
used in the field.
Field Methods
The overall goal of this archaeological investigation was to locate and
evaluate archaeological sites within the project area so that avoidance measures
could be implemented during the proposed seismic activities. The following
methods were taken from a Research Design for this project submitted to the
USFS and SHPO prior to the commencement of the field survey as well as a
revised Research Design adopted during the survey. The revised document is
included in this report as Appendix I.
The archaeological investigators consisted of teams of archaeologists led
by assistants to the Project Archaeologist under his supervision. These teams
performed several tasks that include (1) marking previously recorded sites for
avoidance by the drillers, (2) excavating shovel tests at each source point and
along drill access routes, and (3) recording all archaeological sites found during
this study.
The boundaries of each previously recorded site considered to be
potentially eligible for listing in the NRHP was marked with yellow and black
striped flagging tape tied to trees and bushes along the site’s boundary. A 50meter (164 foot) buffer was established around each site, and this buffer was
plotted on the project area maps. No source points or drill access routes were
placed on sites or within this buffer zone unless approved by the USFS
Archaeologist. The team of archaeologists charged with the task of marking
previously recorded sites also took color and black-and-white photographs of the
site area and noted any changes in site condition since the site was last visited.
In order to accurately mark these sites, the crew identified the center of each site
using a handheld GPS and by comparing the topographic features in the field to
those plotted on the topographic map.
Once the center of the site was established, the boundaries were marked
as per information provided by the original site card. In many cases the USFS
had marked the site’s boundary by applying green and white paint on trees.
Teams of archaeologists excavating shovel tests at all source point
locations and approximately every 30 meters along all access routes performed
the field survey. Shovel tests were also placed in obvious high probability areas
along the access routes. Eroded and otherwise disturbed areas were carefully
examined for exposed cultural materials.

51

Surface examinations were also made for historic features in all survey
areas. Each archaeologist had field maps that depicted the positions of all
previously recorded sites and the areas that have been previously surveyed.
Previously surveyed areas, disturbed areas such as logging roads or
slopes greater than 15 degrees, and locations of previously recorded sites that
have been determined to be not significant were not shovel tested. Instead, they
were discussed in the field notes. Three shovel tests were excavated at all
source points within 150 meters (193 feet) of streams and rivers. These shovel
tests were located at the source point location and at two radials ranging from 10
to 15 meters from the source point depending on terrain and objects such as
fallen trees. Only one shovel test was excavated at source points greater than
150 meters from streams and rivers. The shovel tests were dug manually, and
all excavated fill was passed through quarter-inch hardware cloth. Each test was
approximately 30 cm x 30 cm in size and excavated to the sterile clay subsoil
when possible. At sites in shallow soils (i.e., 50 cm or less), shovel tests were
not excavated by level. Only arbitrary 10 cm levels were excavated at those
sites containing deep soils. A shovel test log was maintained on which all
relevant data were recorded such as test number, stake number, depth of test,
initials of excavator, and a brief description of artifacts recovered. Shovel test
logs for tests excavated at sites and isolated finds are included in Volume II,
while the off-site shovel test logs are included in Volume III. All artifacts found in
each test were collected for analysis in the laboratory. The investigators used
specially created shovel test logs to record their data.
The stake number identified shovel tests at source points, and any offset
to this location was recorded. Access route shovel tests were plotted on the field
maps, and access along cut and staked receiver lines were located by their
relative position to survey stakes. Shovel tests along access routes with no
stakes or cut lines were positioned by use of handheld GPS tracks and
waypoints as needed.
Access routes were investigated by excavating shovel tests approximately
every 30 meters (98 feet) along all new routes. Efforts were made to deviate
from the 30 meter interval in order to test high probability areas (i.e., highest
point on a knoll or levee or ridge crest) when these areas were found to be within
the path of the access route. Areas outside the boundaries of the Bienville
National Forest were not surveyed.
Teams of at least two archaeologists investigated the source points and
access routes. At times, the teams worked on different parts of the flagged
route. In these cases, radio contact was maintained in order to facilitate
movements of the teams from one work area to the next work area.

52

When an archaeological site was found, its position was noted using a
handheld GPS, and its location was noted on the proper topographic map. The
discovery shovel test was given the designation of Shovel Test 1, and the area
was marked with yellow and black flagging tied to trees. The site was given a
temporary field number consisting of the archaeologist’s initials followed by a
number indicating the total number of sites the archaeologist had found on the
survey to that date. The first site recorded by Troy O. Martin, for example, was
given the temporary number TM-01.
A site delineation team consisting of an Assistant Project Archaeologist
and archaeological technicians, usually four to six people, delineated the site.
Information obtained during delineation included site size, soils, depth of artifacts,
and location of the site on the landform. Artifacts were collected from all positive
shovel tests for analysis. The survey crew and the site recording crew kept Field
notes. These notes were used to write the site descriptions that appear later in
this report. During the delineation process, shovel testing along four cardinal
directions were dug as specified in the project research design until two
consecutive sterile tests were excavated in all directions depending on the nature
of the landform. Sometimes, for example, shovel tests could not be excavated in
one direction due to a steep slope. The shovel tests were excavated at fivemeter intervals for small sites. At sites greater than 40 meters in at least one
direction, the interval was increased to 10 meters between tests. The large sites
were tested along their long axis by lines of perpendicular tests to determine site
width. A site map was prepared that depicted the location of all shovel tests
(positive and negative), topographic contours, and reference points (e.g., roads,
trails), if present. The location of the approximate center of each site was located
with a hand-held GPS. These locations were later plotted on 7.5’ USGS
quadrangle maps. All sites were marked with yellow and black striped flagging
tape. Sites were photo-documented with Fujichrome 35 mm slide film and blackand-white print film.
Source points and access areas within the newly recorded site boundaries
or buffer areas were either relocated outside the boundaries or special
permission was obtained from the Bienville National Forest Archaeologist for
seismic activities to proceed with special instructions or monitoring. All source
points and access routes moved outside the site areas were shovel tested as
stated above.
At the end of each field day, archaeologists turned in all of the day’s data
forms, artifacts, and maps to the Assistant Project Archaeologist in charge of site
recording who checked them for completeness and passed them on to the
Project Archaeologist. This information was then submitted to the Principal
Investigator for inclusion in the report. The Project Archaeologist assisted in the
recording activities when possible and prepared all data for transmittal to the
Principal Investigator and Regional Specialist.

53

Avoidance Plan Methods
The survey area was divided into five areas, each containing
approximately 20 percent of the project area. As each area was finished, an
Avoidance Plan was developed consisting of statements about what previously
recorded sites and cemeteries were marked in the area for avoidance, how many
newly discovered sites were in the area, and the avoidance plans for these sites.
A map was produced indicating source points, access routes shovel tested,
previously surveyed areas, previously recorded sites, newly recorded sites, and
all site buffers. A 50-meter (164 foot) buffer was placed on all new and
previously recorded significant sites.
In some cases seismic activities were recommended to proceed within
site buffer areas, and sometimes they were allowed in site areas. These
recommendations depended on disturbance present. If a site was in a previously
disturbed area such as an access route it was recommended that seismic activity
be allowed to be conducted in the area. Seismic activity was also recommended
for source points within the footprint of old roads, trams, or skidder roads as well
as those off the site landform but within the site buffer. In many cases the
presence of an archaeological monitor was recommended during seismic
activities in these areas.
An Avoidance Plan and map were submitted for each area to the Bienville
National Forest Archaeologist for approval. All sites were treated as having an
“unknown significance” and were thereby protected during the drilling phase.
This allowed drilling to proceed prior to report submittal.
All drilling was conducted with an archaeological monitor in the project
area to shovel test source point and access route moves, record any sites found
during these proceedings and to monitor drilling activities within site boundaries
or buffer areas.
Post-Field Methods
Once the fieldwork was completed, site significance was determined and
included on the MDAH site cards and in this report. All sites were evaluated in
terms of their potential for listing in the NRHP. These evaluations were based on
a list of criteria for site significance prepared by the USFS (Appendix IX). Sites
were determined to be either eligible, potentially eligible, or ineligible. No sites
were deemed eligible since this requires further investigations past the phase I
survey stage.
State of Mississippi site cards were filled out for each site and submitted to
MDAH. Once official state site numbers were assigned, these numbers were
added to all documents pertaining to these sites. Potentially eligible sites are
listed as unknown on the MDAH site cards.

54

All field notes, data forms, field site maps, photo-documentation, and
artifacts were prepared for curation by the Regional Specialist as per the
Guidelines for Archaeological Investigations and Reports in Mississippi and
submitted to the USFS.
Laboratory Methods
All artifacts recovered as a result of the Phase I survey were washed,
cataloged, and placed in analytical categories for proper analysis and
documentation. Artifacts were placed in new bags with site provenience clearly
labeled on the exterior of each bag. Acid free curation tags containing site
provenience were also inserted in all bags containing artifacts. All artifacts were
physically labeled with archival quality pens and covered with a layer of polyvinyl
acetate (PVA) marking varnish for permanent curation. The permanent site
number and corresponding catalog number assigned in the laboratory was
written on all artifacts large enough to do so. If size prohibited the writing of the
complete provenience information, the catalog number took preference. Upon
completion of the analysis, artifacts were re-bagged according to site and intrasite provenience and submitted to the USFS for permanent curation.
Prehistoric Artifact Analysis
The lithic analysis for this project included the sorting and identification of
all chipped stone artifacts and debitage. Lithic artifacts were sorted into seven
techno-functional classes. In addition, completed projectile points and bifaces
were measured for length, width, and overall thickness. The six classes include
(1) projectile point/knife, (2) bifaces lacking haft elements, (3) flake tools and
drills, (4) ground stone tools, (5) cores, and (6) debitage. Techno-functional
categories used during analysis are briefly discussed below.
Projectile Point/Knife: A projectile point or knife is a bifacially worked
stone tool consisting of two acute marginal edges, sharpened and forming a
sharp pointed tip at the extreme distal end. The proximal end of the tool has a
haft element for attachment to a shaft or handle. When possible, projectile points
were typed and placed into temporally diagnostic categories. Projectile points
are often taken as an indicator of chronology and provide occupational history of
a given site. Bifaces with haft elements are referred to by some archaeologists
as “hafted bifaces.”
Bifaces Lacking Haft Elements: This class of bifaces was sorted and
classified into four basic categories. They are Biface I, Biface II, Biface III, and
unidentifiable biface fragment. Biface categories are defined based on a
reduction sequence method developed as part of this project’s lithic analysis.
The method was developed partially on Johnson’s (1989) biface production
trajectory and is discussed at length in the Lithic Analysis section below. Bifaces
lacking haft elements are referred to by some archaeologists as “non-hafted
bifaces.”

55

Flake Tools and Drills: This is a broad category that includes unifacially
and bifacially worked flake scrapers, side scrapers, gravers, blades, and drills.
Flake tools are usually manufactured on large flakes, but they may also consist
of smaller micro-flakes with minimum to total retouch around the marginal edges.
Such tools may have been hafted to wooden shafts to be used in the processing
of vegetable matter such as tubers (H. Edwin Jackson, personal communication).
A uniface is defined as a tool flaked only on one side as a result of soft hammer
percussion retouch. Unifaces are often manufactured for the purpose of
producing knives, scrapers, and gravers. A drill is defined as a tool that has a
long, narrow bifacially worked blade or tip that is often used to cut, puncture,
abrade, and be capable of fast rotations. Flake tools are often associated with
expedient technologies; however, in the case of unifacially worked scrapers and
drills they were usually part of a lithic tool kit and were probably carried around
for future use. Such tools are referred to by some archaeologists as “curated
artifacts.”
Ground Stone Tools: Ground stone tools include artifacts that are
culturally modified by abrading, pecking, or grinding. Included in this category
are grinding stones and nutting stones, hammerstones, bannerstones, anvils,
and cobble celts. Both grinding stones and nutting stones may be considered to
be “site furniture” (Binford 1983). A nutting stone may or may not have polishing
but may contain one or more pitted depressions on the working surface. These
depressions were used to crack nuts. Due to repeated use, it is reasonable to
state that a fairly large or dense stone was used for such tasks. Anvils are
described as stones containing at least one shallow, slightly battered concavity
used in the manufacture and reduction of lithic material. Anvil stones may also
contain edge battering, and they may exhibit occasional breakage through one or
more pits from repeated use. Such stone tools were possibly used in the bipolar
lithic reduction process.
Cores: Cores, often referred to as “reduced stone,” are artifacts that were
not used as formal or expedient tools. Instead, they represent some form or
aspect of the tool making process. This category includes amorphous cores and
blade cores. An amorphous core is a cobble or piece of raw material from which
flakes have been removed in a random, non-patterned manner for the production
of flake tools or initial biface trimming. Similarly, a blade core is defined as a
cobble or piece of raw material that has been modified with a striking platform for
the production of blade flakes that may have been used as expedient knives or
flake tools.

56

Debitage: One avenue by which archaeologists can postulate adaptive
changes is through the analysis of lithic debitage. This analysis provides an
analytical tool from which variability within and between prehistoric sites is
accessed. This variability is often seen as a reflection of prehistoric settlement,
mobility, and adaptive strategies. According to Shott (1994), the analysis of lithic
debitage provides as much or more information than the formal and informal
chipped stone tools recovered from a site.
Generally, lithic debitage analysis employs the recordation and analysis of
various attributes or combinations of attributes to provide information regarding
the reduction stage or methods of stone tool production employed by prehistoric
site occupants (Ahler 1989; Carr 1995; Magne 1985; Sullivan and Rosen 1985).
The primary goal of lithic debitage analysis is to determine the lithic organization
and technology of the site’s occupants and compare the results to other site
assemblages in an effort to understand the mobility, site function, and settlement
adaptations of prehistoric peoples who occupied southeast Mississippi.
The lithic debitage analysis that was followed here is an abbreviated
procedure based on debitage analyses conducted in southeast Mississippi and
surrounding areas (e.g., Fields et al. 2005; Bradbury and Carr 1995) and
originally set forth by Magne (1985). The original methodology includes a distinct
set of attributes that, when recorded and compared, reveal patterns that may be
useful in determining site function. As a result of small artifact sample sizes, only
reduction stages, raw material type, and utilization were recorded for each piece
of a debitage. Lithic debitage from each site were coded individually for the
attributes listed below.
Types of raw material present at the various sites in the project area
include Citronelle gravel, Tallahatta quartzite, silicified sandstone, Catahoula
quartzite, Kosciesko quartzite, and Fort Payne chert. The use of a comparative
collection in possession of the Regional Specialist was utilized in the raw material
identification.
The platform facet number provides reduction stage information that
indicates the number of previous removals from the platform surface. A higher
number indicates a late stage reduction, while a smaller number generally
indicates fewer prior removals and an earlier stage in the manufacturing process
(Bradbury and Carr 1995).
Dorsal scars provide information relating to the number of previous
removals and additional information regarding reduction stages. Low numbers of
dorsal scars may indicate earlier stages of reduction as opposed to higher
numbers, which are generally thought to represent later stages of production
(Bradbury and Carr 1995).

57

All flakes were examined under a 3.5 x Opti-Visor for evidence of microflake removals and altered edges. Utilized flakes include those struck from
amorphous or blade cores and are typically associated with an expedient
technology. Retouched flakes exhibit purposeful flake scars presumably to
increase use life or modify the edge angle and shape.
Flakes were also described according to the reduction stage present.
Categories include early, middle, and late, biface thinning flakes; angular shatter,
and eroded or indiscernible specimens. The early reduction stage is generally
associated with core reduction and the initial stages in biface manufacture.
Flakes removed during the middle reduction stage represent trimming and
shaping of bifacial tools. Flakes removed during the late reduction stage were
produced during the latter half of tool manufacture or maintenance. Biface
thinning flakes are considered part of the late stage manufacturing process and
may be combined with late stage reduction. Angular shatter includes small
particles of raw material that exhibit a lack of flake characteristics and are
interpreted as byproducts of core reduction. Assignment of a reduction stage to
a significant percentage of Tallahatta quartzite and siliceous sandstone proved
difficult due to the friable and eroded condition of the flakes; therefore these
flakes were coded as “eroded” and removed from the study (Jackson and Fields
2001a, 2001b).
Reduction stages provide a type or approximate stage from which
inferences can be made regarding lithic reduction activities. Although the
reduction stage should be viewed as a continuum rather than discrete stages, the
assignment of stages assists in the interpretation of on site activities related to
stone tool manufacture and maintenance (Shott 1994; Carr 1994).
Reduction stages were assigned based on the previously discussed
attributes, platform facet number and dorsal scar count. In the case of complete
and proximal flakes, early stage reduction was assigned if 0-1 facets were
present. Two platform facets were assigned a middle stage, and three or more
were assigned to a late stage of reduction. For medial and distal flakes,
assignment was based on the number of dorsal scars present. Early stage
contained 0-1 dorsal scars. Two dorsal scars were coded as middle stage
reduction, and three or more were assigned to late stage. Lipped platforms were
taken to represent biface thinning flakes (Bradbury and Carr 1995).
Sandstone Analysis
All sandstone recovered during the course of the survey was sorted by
provenience. Additionally, each piece of sandstone was individually examined
for any obvious signs of modification. Modification is generally seen as abrasion,
pitting, and/or smoothing of one or more surfaces.

58

Burned Clay (Daub) Analysis
All burned clay (daub) was sorted by provenience. Each piece was
analyzed for signs of impressions, intentional tempering, and hand molding. If
specimens were identified as containing one or more of the above attributes, they
were removed and labeled separately from the remaining bulk assemblage.
Ceramic Analysis
The ceramic analysis for this project included a single analysis program
applied to the total ceramic assemblage. In all, four variables were recorded
during the analysis. The analysis was applied to the total ceramic assemblage
with each site analyzed separately. Variables recorded as part of the analysis
include (1) portion, (2) temper, (3) decoration technique, and (4) ceramic type
and variety. Each variable is discussed briefly below.
Portion: Portion refers to that part of the vessel from which a sherd
originated. Vessel portions included body, rim, basal, and indeterminate
(sherdlets). Sherdlets represent those sherds that were eroded or fragmented
and are one centimeter or smaller in size. Generally, these specimens offer no
substantial value to the overall ceramic assemblage.
Temper: Temper, or the paste additive used during firing to control
shrinkage and/or plasticity altering (Keith 1997), was recorded for all discernable
sherds. Sherds were examined under a Walter Professional Stereo Microscope.
Temper is used as a chronological marker and also as a way to compare
ceramics from across the area. Temper types include grog (crushed sherds),
sand, shell and grog, bone and grog, and sand and grog.
Decorative Techniques: Decorative Techniques and attributes refer to
the type of decoration exhibited on completed surfaces of each sherd. In some
cases, sherds were too eroded or crumbled to confidently assign a decorative
technique.
Therefore, sherdlets and eroded specimens were coded as
“indiscernable.” Decorative techniques coded for include undecorated (plain),
cord-marked, incised, stamped, and punctuated.
Ceramic Type and Variety: When possible, sherds were assigned a
known historic type, and variety. This was based on the examination of a
combination of attributes including exterior vessel decoration and temper type
and density.

59

Historic Artifact Analysis
Historic artifacts were identified using standard historic sources for the
southeast (e.g., Orser [1983]; Brown [1982], and Edwards and Wells [1993]). In
addition to standard sources, local resources as well as a historic comparative
collection housed at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg were
utilized.
Following the assignment of catalog numbers, artifacts were sorted into
functional artifact groups by site. For this analysis, a functional typology utilized
by Orser (1988) was applied to all artifacts recovered. Orser’s typology, similar
to South’s (1977) categories, was developed specifically to deal with
assemblages dating from the middle of the 19th century through early 20th
century. Orser’s basic categories utilized for this analysis are presented below in
Table 2.
Historic ceramics were divided into the following categories: earthenware,
ironstone, and semi-vitreous wares. Semi-vitreous wares include porcelains,
yellow ware, coarse earthenwares, and stonewares. Vessel forms were
identified when possible. When present, decoration and color are discussed
along with the size category of each sherd recovered. The diameter of plates,
bowls, and jars were determined by use of a “bull’s-eye” diagram of concentric
circles of varying diameters measured in centimeters. Categories were achieved
by centering the sherd on the diagram and reading the lowest numbered circle
within which it is completely contained. Dates were assigned based on ceramic
ware types and/or decorative techniques.
Glass artifacts were divided into container glass or window glass. Color,
when available, was recorded for container sherds. Color and embossing was
used as a dating technique for class containers. When possible, container
shape, manufacturing technique, and decoration were recorded for each sherd.
Nails were divided into three types according to method of manufacture.
These types (from oldest to most recent) are wrought nails, cut nails, and wire
nails. Wrought nails were forged by hand and were used until replaced by the
invention of new machinery that allowed sheet metal to be cut into nails. Cut
nails did not immediately replace wrought nails. The most recent (and current)
method of nail manufacture is the wire nail, which can be distinguished by its
circular cross-section. The machine used to make wire nails became popular in
the early 20th century. It should be stated that cut nails were often in use after
the introduction of wire nails; therefore, there presence is not always an indicator
of an earlier date without accompanying artifacts from the same time period. A
pennyweight chart was used to determine the length of complete specimens.
Comments on the condition of individual specimens include such types as
“clenched” or “bent.”

Faunal Specimens
All faunal materials (n=3) were analyzed by Dr. H. Edwin Jackson, Ph.D.
at the University of Southern Mississippi utilizing a zoo-archaeological
comparative collection housed at the University of Southern Mississippi. Faunal
materials were typed to specimen element and species when possible.
Specimens were analyzed for use wear such as butchering that would indicate
functional use or post-depositional processes, and no evidence of butchering or
use wear was found.
Site Descriptions
Those sites found in the project area were classified according to age and
function. Three classes of sites were identified – seasonal residential base
camps, short term base camps, and temporary special use camps. The criteria
used to assign a site to one of these categories are presented below.
Seasonal Residential Base Camps: These sites contain debitage
represented by all stages of manufacture using local materials. The assemblage
should also contain a slightly higher percentage of late stage flakes, but the
various manufacturing stages (as represented in the assemblage) can be evenly
distributed. These sites usually contain a wide variety of tool types such as
cores, exhausted tools, expedient flake tools, and informal tools such as
scrapers, spokeshaves, drills, and multi-functional bifaces. Lithic activities
include the manufacture of new tools, maintenance of existing tools, rehafting,
and processing of plants and animals. Features should be present and will
include earth ovens, hearths, refuse pits, and activity areas for lithic manufacture
and maintenance. Woodland Stage sites should produce ceramic sherds
representing cooking and processing tasks. Non-local raw materials will be
mostly late stage debitage or exhausted stone tools. These sites are extremely
visible in the archaeological record, and artifact density is very high.
Short Term Base Camps: These sites should contain all stages of biface
manufacture using local materials. There should also be a higher percentage of
late stage flakes due to “gearing up” activities and tool maintenance. Early stage
flakes will be present but will not exceed late stage flakes in numbers of
specimens. Also, there should be low numbers of flakes representing middle
stages of reduction. Early stage debitage would have been produced during the
manufacture of expedient flake tools. Tool diversity will be very low, as the camp
is mostly task specific in nature. Woodland Stage sites may contain ceramics.
Features include hearths and activity areas. These sites produce moderate
artifact densities and are fairly visible in the archaeological record, and artifact
density is moderate.

62

Temporary Special Use Camps: These sites include hunting and
foraging camps, areas where raw materials were procured, sites where animals
were killed and/or butchered, and localities where plants were processed.
Debitage should include mostly late stage debris and task specific tools unless at
an area where raw materials were procured. Features are minimally represented
and should not produce ceramics at Woodland sites. The visibility, as well as
artifact density, of these sites in the archaeological record is very low.

LITHIC ANALYSIS
Introduction
In all, 2755 lithic specimens were found during the Smith County 3-D
seismic survey. The following artifact discussions of temporally diagnostic types
are presented in chronological order from Archaic through the Woodland stages.
The following discussions do not include the two sites discovered during the
monitoring phase.
Projectile Points/Knives
Twenty-four lithic tools were classified as projectile points or knives.
Within this group, 13 formal types were recognized. One specimen could not be
confidently placed within a known type, and it was listed as an unidentified
projectile point. Projectile point types recovered during the survey are consistent
with other projectile points recovered in the surrounding area and date from the
Middle Archaic to the Early Mississippian periods. The majority of the projectile
points recovered date to the Late Gulf Formational (Early Woodland) and Middle
and Late Woodland periods. Below is a discussion of all projectile point types
recovered during the course of the seismic survey. The discussion includes
location data (i.e., site, grid coordinates, and catalog number), raw material used
in manufacture, metric and morphological attributes, breakage patterns (when
available), and inferred age. The data are presented from earliest to latest.
Specific data for these points are presented in Table 3.
White Springs
One projectile point (Figure 5a) was identified as belonging to the White
Springs type as defined by McGahey (2000:99). This Middle Archaic Period point
was found at site 22-Sm-1269. It is made from Fort Payne chert and measures
64.9 mm (length) x 41.8 mm (width) x 10.3 mm (thickness). This specimen has
the characteristic White Springs base. It is very well made with large random
flake scars across both faces. Micro-flaking is evident along both lateral edges of
the blade.
White Springs projectile points are generally considered to be a part of a
morphological continuum cluster that also includes point types Morrow Mountain
and Sykes. McGahey (2000:99) cites Bense (1994:298) and (Alexander
1980:126) as placing Sykes points and White Springs points within the same
time frame and cluster. McGahey (2000:99) notes the primary difference
between the two types is the hafting element. A White Springs base is generally
extremely short, well thinned, and almost non-existent. The Sykes base
(although being short) is not thinned or extremely short and more closely
resembles the base of a bifacially beveled Benton point (McGahey 2000:99).

Figure 5. Middle to Late Archaic Period Projectile Points
Opossum Bayou
One projectile point was identified as belonging to the Opossum Bayou
type (Figure 5b) as defined by McGahey (2000:132). This Middle to Late Archaic
period point was found at site 22-Sm-1256 in Test Unit 3. It is made from
Citronelle gravel and measures 45.1 mm (length) x 28.0 mm (width) x 12.8 mm
(thickness). One blade edge is slightly excurvate, and the other is straight. The
excurvate edge is likely the result of resharpening on one side creating the
asymmetrical look. Cortex is visible on one dorsal surface of the stem. One
lateral blade edge has not been completely thinned as a result of hinge fracturing
during manufacture. Although the blade edge has not been completely
straightened and thinned, the specimen appears to have been used, at least on
the excurvate blade edge. The tip has been thinned by pressure flaking, is crude
in manufacture, and is side-notched with a straight stem.

67

Opossum Bayou points are generally quite thick and chunky according to
McGahey (2000:132). Furthermore, McGahey suggests they are closely related
to the Denton point. Most specimens are side-notched, but some may be cornernotched. Blade edges are straight to excurvate. Stems are expanded with a
convex base that may be thinned. Dates given for the Opossum Bayou place the
point type during the later part of the Middle Archaic Period through the early
Late Archaic Period (McGahey 2000:133).
McIntire
Three projectile points were identified as belonging to the McIntire type
(Figure 5c-e) as defined by McGahey (2000:138) and Cambron and Hulse
(1975:86). These Middle to Late Archaic period points were recovered from sites
22-Sm-1246, 22-Sm-1252, and 22-Sm-1271. They are all manufactured from
Citronelle gravels. The metric measurements fall within the range presented by
McGahey (2000). The specimens have straight to slightly excurvate blade edges.
Two specimens (Figure 5c,e) represent complete projectile points. Stems are
straight to slightly contracting with a straight base that has been thinned.
Specimen 176 (Figure 5d) is missing the distal tip as a result of a lateral snap.
Specimen 66 (Figure 5c) was recovered from a burned clay concentration and
exhibits a reddened hue on the dorsal face that was laying flat. It is unsure at this
point whether the burned clay concentration is of cultural or non-cultural origin.
McIntire points are medium sized with straight to excurvate blade edges
and straight to slightly contracting stems. Stem bases are straight and thinned.
This type is bracketed within a Middle to Late Archaic time frame by Cambron
and Hulse (1975). McGahey (2000:39) suggests an early Late Archaic Period
affiliation. One McIntire recorded south of the project area at 22-Gn-685 was
recovered from a large pile of tested sandstone slabs, blocky fragments, and
exhausted core fragments. A radiocarbon sample taken from the feature returned
an Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) date of 3260+40 B.P. (calibrated 1620
B.C. to 1430 B.C.) (Beta-189842, calibrated at 2 sigma with the Pretoria
Calibration Procedure program [Talma and Vogel 1993]).
Based on these findings, the McIntire point usage appears to range in age
beginning in the late Middle Archaic Period, possibly climaxing during the Late
Archaic Period, and diminishing toward the middle Gulf Formational Period, at
least in southeast Mississippi (Fields et. al. 2005).

68

Kent
One projectile point was identified as belonging to the Kent type (Figure
6a) as defined by McGahey (2000:163). This Late Archaic Period point was
recovered from site 22-Sm-1281. It is made from Citronelle gravel and measures
36.5 mm (length) x 19.8 mm (width) x 10.6 mm (thickness). The specimen has
straight blade edges with one slightly incurving edge as a result of excessive resharpening. The stem is straight sided with a straight base containing dorsal
cortex. Kent points are small to medium size points similar to the Pontchartrain
type. Blade edges are straight and the stem is square or straight sided with a
straight basal edge.
Mud Creek
One projectile point was identified as belonging to the Mud Creek type
(Figure 6b) as defined by McGahey (2000:171) and Cambron and Hulse
(1985:94). This Late Archaic to Late Gulf Formational period point was found at
site 22-Sm-1266. It is maufactured from Citronelle gravel and measures 33.5
mm (length – incomplete measurement) x 27.8 mm (width) x 10.5 mm
(thickness). The specimen is missing its upper blade as a result of an impact
fracture during utilization. The partial blade edge is straight and alternate
beveled. The specimen has a straight stem with a straight basal edge that has
been thinned.
Mud Creek points are defined as being small to medium sized projectile
points with a triangular blade outline. Stems are straight sided and have a
straight basal edge. Mud Creek points are dated to the Late Archaic period and
Gulf Formational Stage in Mississippi (McGahey 2000: 171).
Little Bear Creek
One projectile point was identified as belonging to the Little Bear Creek
type (Figure 6c) as defined by McGahey (2000:152) and Cambron and Hulse
(1975:85). This Late Archaic to Late Woodland period point was recovered from
site 22-Sm-1257. It is manufactured from Citronelle gravel and measures 31.4
mm (length – incomplete measurement) x 20.3 mm (width) x 5.4 mm (thickness).
The specimen is broken and consists of a partial blade and hafting element. The
specimen has fine pressure flaking along both blade edges. The blade was
broken as a result of a lateral snap, possibly as a result of maintenance activities
or utilization. The stem is long and narrow and has a thinned basal edge.

69

Figure 6. Late Archaic and Early Woodland Period Projectile Points

Little Bear Creek points range in size from small to large. This point type
typically has a straight stem and a basal edge that is unfinished in some
specimens. The blade edges are excurvate. Cambron and Hulse (1975:85)
estimate an introduction of the type during the Late Archaic Period with a climax
during the Late Woodland Period. One radiocarbon date is associated with a
Little Bear Creek in southeast Mississippi. The specimen was recovered
adjacent to a clay line pit feature at 22-Gn-687 in Greene County. A radiocarbon
sample taken from the feature returned an AMS date of 2750+40 B.P. (calibrated
920 B.C. to 800 B.C.) (Beta-179318, Calibrated at 2 sigma with the Pretoria
Calibration Procedure program [Talma and Vogel 1993]). The returned AMS date
indicates a Late Gulf Formational association for Little Bear Creek points in
southeast Mississippi (Fields et. al. 2005).

70

Ledbetter
One projectile point was identified as belonging to the Ledbetter type
(Figure 6d) as defined by McGahey (2000:141). This Late Gulf Formational
(Early Woodland) Period point was recovered from site 22-Sm-1263. It is made
from Citronelle gravel and measures 54.3 mm (length) x 24.5 mm (width) x 10.7
mm (thickness). The blade edges are asymmetrical with one straight and the
other incurvate. One shoulder is slightly higher than the other. The blade edges
have been sharpened extensively, possibly leading to the asymmetrical shape of
the blade. The stem is contracting with a straight, thinned basal edge.
Ledbetter projectile points are medium to large with a characteristically
asymmetrical appearance as a result of blade edges differing, one recurve and
the other convex. Stems are generally contracting with straight bases. McGahey
(2000:141) places the Ledbetter in a Late Archaic chronology.
Flint Creek/Pontchartrain
Three projectile points were identified as belonging to the Flint Creek or
Pontchartrain type (Figure 6e-g) as defined by McGahey (2000:165). These Late
Gulf Formational (Early Woodland) Period points were recovered from sites 22Sm-1263, 22-Sm-1273, and 22-Sm-1287.
They are manufactured from
Citronelle gravel. The specimen found at 22-Sm-1273 (Figure 6f) is defined in
this report as Flint Creek, while the others more closely resemble the
Pontchartrain type.
McGahey (2000:165) lumps Flint Creek and Pontchartrain points into one
category based on similarities exhibited by the two point types. He describes the
Flint Creek type as having slightly expanding stems compared to Pontchartrain
points that have straight to slightly contracting stems. Blade edges on the Flint
Creek type are generally well serrated and exhibit fine pressure flaking.
Specimen 533 (Figure 6f) is defined here as a Flint Creek point missing
the distal tip as a result of a lateral snap. The remaining blade edges are finely
serrated and are straight. The stem is partially broken but appears to be straight
with the basal edge snapped. The remaining specimens are defined here as
Pontchartrain points. Both are manufactured from large Citronelle gravel flakes.
The specimen from 22-Sm-1287 (Figure 6g) has asymmetrical blade edges, one
excurvate edge, and one straight edge. Both blade edges are finely serrated. The
stem shows evidence of the flake bulb of percussion and maintains dorsal cortex
on the basal edge. The specimen recovered from 22-Sm-1263 has straight,
serrated blade edges with slightly barbed shoulders. The stem is straight and
maintains dorsal cortex on the basal edge and one dorsal side.

71

Tombigbee Stemmed
Four projectile points were identified as belonging to the Tombigbee
Stemmed type (Figure 7a-d) as defined by McGahey (2000:196). These Middle
Woodland Period points were recovered from sites 22-Sm-1257, 22-Sm-1270,
and 22-Sm-1274. Three specimens are manufactured from Citronelle gravel,
and one is manufactured from Tallahatta quartzite (Figure 7c). The Citronelle
gravel specimens are very similar in the method of manufacture. They have
straight blade edges that are slightly asymmetrical. One shoulder on each
specimen is slightly higher than the other. Two specimens (Figure 7b, d) are
rather crude in manufacture with large random flake scars across the faces. The
stems are slightly contracting. The specimen manufactured from Tallahatta
quartzite does not exhibit heavy erosion so characteristic with this raw material.
Blade edges are straight and one shoulder is missing. The stem is straight with a
rounded, thinned basal edge. Tombigbee Stemmed is generally a broad point
type category similar to the “catch all” Gary type. It is defined as a relatively
small dart point with straight to slightly excurvate blade edges and a straight to
contracting stem. In some specimens, the cortex may still be visible along the
basal edge.

Figure 7. Middle to Late Woodland Period Projectile Points

72

Edwards Stemmed
Two projectile points were identified as belonging to the Edwards
Stemmed type (Figure 7f-g) as defined by McGahey (2000:194) and Williams
and Brain (1983:225-229). These Middle to Late Woodland period points were
recovered from sites 22-Sm-1244 and 22-SM-1264. Specimen Number 8 (Figure
7g) is manufactured from Tallahatta quartzite, and Specimen Number 427
(Figure 7f) is manufactured from Citronelle grave chertl.
The Tallahatta quartzite specimen is not eroded, indicating it’s younger
age compared to older more eroded Archaic specimens. The blade edges are
straight, and the extreme distal tip is missing. The stem is small and straight with
a snapped basal edge. The Citronelle gravel chert specimen is missing the upper
blade portion as a result of a lateral snap. The stem is straight with a straight
basal edge.
The Edwards Stemmed type is very similar to the previously discussed
Tombigbee Stemmed point. The only difference is the shape of the stem; with
Edwards having straight or squared stems and straight basal edges. Overall, the
point types are a small to medium dart point with straight to slightly excurvate
blade edges.
Gary variety Mabon
One projectile point was identified as belonging to the Gary type variety
Mabon (Figure 7e) as defined by McGahey (2000:192) and Williams and Brain
(1983:233). This Middle to Late Woodland period point was recovered from site
22-Sm-1257. It is manufactured from Talahatta quartzite and measures 31.6 mm
(length) x 14.0 mm (width) x 7.4 mm (thickness). This specimen is similar to
examples presented by McGahey (2000:193). It has a straight triangular blade,
weak shoulders, and a round based contracting stem. The specimen is fairly well
made with pressure flaking apparent along both blade edges. Additionally, the
specimen is not severely eroded.
The Gary variety Maybon type was formally defined by Williams and Brain
(1983:233) based on 15 specimens recovered from the Lake George site in
Yazoo County, Mississippi. This type is, on average, smaller than the Gary
variety. Gary type that is assigned to the Late Archaic/Late Gulf Formational
period. Gary variety Maybon points are generally small to medium sized dart
points. The blade is straight to slightly incurving, possibly as a result of
sharpening activities. Stems for most specimens are tapered and round or
pointed.

73

Collins Side Notched
Collins Side Notched points are small true arrow points that represent one
of the most abundant point types in southeast and central Mississippi. Collins
points are divided into three varieties; Collins, Claiborne, and Clifton (Williams
and Brain 1983:223). The Collins variety is long straight bladed with broad corner
notches and some retouch along the blade edges and stem. The Claiborne
variety is manufactured on a single flake and has some retouch. Clifton points
are smaller and exhibit narrow notches and fine retouch (Williams and Brain
1983:223).
Three projectile points were identified as belonging to the Collins Side
Notched or Collins Stemmed type (Figure 8a-c) as defined by McGahey
(2000:199) and Williams and Brain (1983:223). These Late Woodland to Early
Mississippian period points were recovered from sites 22-Sm-1246, 22-Sm-264,
and 22-Sm-1265. All specimens are manufactured from Citronelle gravel chert.
Of the three varieties discussed above, one (Figure 8a) is classified as variety
Collins, one (Figure 8b) as is classified as variety Clifton, and one (Figure 8c) is
classified as variety Claiborne. The variety Collins is a long, narrow straight
bladed arrow point with broad corner notches. The specimen has been resharpened and is missing the extreme tip. The variety Clifton arrow point is
smaller than the other two arrow points and has shallow, narrow corner notches
and retouch along the extreme distal tip. The variety Claiborne specimen is
manufactured on a flake but is very well made and exhibits fine retouch over
much of its surface.
In southeast Mississippi, Collins points are frequently found co-occurring
with Mulberry Creek Cord Marked variety Tallahalla sherds. Such is the case
during this study where at all three sites a Collins arrow point was recovered.
Mulberry Creek Cord Marked variety Tallahalla sherds were also recovered.
Mulberry Creek Cord Marked sherds have been firmly dated to the Late
Woodland Period in southeast Mississippi (Fields 2001a).
Bayogoula Fishtailed
Bayogoula Fishtailed points are small true arrow points with an ovate
blade shape and an expanded corner notched stem. The bases are generally
concave giving the stem the appearance of a fishtail. McGahey (2000:204) notes
that some specimens are also finely serrated.

74

Figure 8. Late Woodland to Early Mississippian Period Projectile Points
One projectile point (Figure 8d) was definitely identified as belonging to
the Bayogoula Fishtailed type as defined by McGahey (2000:204) and Williams
and Brain (1983:222). This Terminal Late Woodland to Early Mississippian
period point was recovered from site 22-Sm-1256 and is manufactured from
Citronelle gravel chert. This specimen is complete, has fine pressure flaking
along the blade edges, and very shallow notches at the base
One projectile point (Figure 8e) is provisionally identified as belonging to
the Bayougoula Fishtailed type. It was recovered from site 22-Sm-1270 and is
manufactured from Fort Payne chert. It is complete, has fine pressure flaking
along the blade edges, has been extensively re-sharpened, and has pronounced
notches at the base. This specimen probably dates to sometime during the
Terminal Late Woodland period or Early Mississippian period. Fort Payne Chert
is a raw material that occurs in the extreme northeastern corner of Mississippi
suggesting that Native Americans occupying site 22-Sm-1270 participated in a
far reaching settlement pattern or more likely participated in raw material trade
with Native Americans in that part of the state.

75

Unidentified Projectile Points
One specimen in the assemblage could not be confidently classified to a
specific type (Figure 9). It was recovered from site 22-Sm-1246 in Shovel Test
84. The specimen is manufactured from Citronelle gravel chert and has been
damaged by an impact causing the blade to snap. it measures 23.9 mm (length –
incomplete measurement) x 18.7 mm (width) x 5.9 mm (thickness). The
remaining portion of the blade has been extensively re-sharpened, almost down
to the stem. The stem is contracting with a straight, thinned basal edge.
Although the age of this point is not known, it probably dates from sometime
between the Archaic Stage and the Woodland Stage based on the shape of the
stem

Figure 9. Unidentified Projectile Point

Unidentified Projectile Point/Knife Tips
Five projectile point/knife tips were recovered during the Smith County 3-D
Seismic Survey (Table 4). Stone tool tips were classified as projectile point or
knife tips based on the presence or absence of edge straightening, fine pressure
flaking, and/or deliberate retouch along one or both marginal edges of the blade.
Broken blade fragments often enter the archaeological record as a consequence
of usage, maintenance, or manufacturing activities. During maintenance, the
possibility of breakage occurs during re-sharpening. Manufacturing breaks or
failures occur most often during thinning processes such as early and late stages
of bifacial tool thinning. Because projectile points and knives have multifunctional uses, tools may be broken during a number of use related activities
including scraping, cutting, perforating, or actual use as a projectile in which case
broken tool fragments may return to a base camp lodged in the carcass of
animals where they would be subsequently discarded during butchering
activities. Specimen 202 is manufactured from Tallahatta quartzite, and the
remaining four specimens are manufactured from Citronell gravel chert.

76

Table 4. Unidentified Projectile Point/Knife Tips

Breakage patterns were identified for each specimen. Breakage patterns
include longitudinal reverse fractures (n=3) and lateral snaps (n=2). Specimens
were sorted into inferred tool size categories based on the morphological
characteristics of the fragments.
Four specimens fell within the small dart
category and likely represent blade tips from small darts such as Tombigbee
Stemmed, Edward Stemmed, or Gary variety Maybon. The remaining specimen
likely represents a fragment from a medium/large dart point.
Unidentified Projectile Point/Knife Stems
Thirteen stems or hafting element fragments were recovered from various
sites throughout the project area (Table 5). Stems are likely to enter the
archaeological record through rehafting maintenance activities. Stem snaps
occur most often during tool utilization (Johnson 1989). Specimens were
analyzed and sorted into morphological categories based on hafting area types
presented by Cambron and Hulse (1975). Categories included stemmed base
types straight (n=11) and expanded (n=2).
Additionally, basal edge
nomenclature was also assigned. Basal edge types included rounded (n=1),
incurvate (n=1), and straight edges (n=11). Specimen 398, recovered from 22Sm1263, is a small expanded, incurvate stem that may have originated from a
Bayogoula Fishtailed or other Mississippi type arrow point. All but one is
manufactured from Citronelle gravel. One specimen is made from silicified
sandstone.

77

Table 5. Unidentified Projectile Point/Knife Stems

Unidentified Projectile Point/Knife Fragments
Six fragments originating from projectile points or knives were unable to
be sorted into identifiable categories such as stems or tips. These fragments
were counted and raw material recorded. Five specimens were manufactured
from Citronelle gravel chert The remaining specimen was manufactured from
Tallahatta quartzite. Citronelle gravel chert fragments overwhelmingly resulted
from heat damage such as pot lids, and expansion fractures. One eroded
specimen was made from Tallahatta quartzite.
78

Bifaces Lacking Haft Elements
This category consists of worked stone tools with clear bifacial flaking on
both faces. These tools have no haft element and may be recovered in various
states of completion. Bifacially worked stone tools were classified based on
criteria established by Johnson’s (1989) biface production trajectory model.
Johnson’s model establishes steps that are used in assigning completion stages
based on the biface edge rather than the degree of thinning or the hafting
element.
A blank is a Biface I whose lateral edges have not been fully worked but
may be transferred from site to site in an incomplete state for future reductive
activities. A Biface II is defined as a biface that has lateral edges completely
worked but not straightened and retains some cortex on one or both dorsal faces.
A Biface III is defined as a biface that has lateral edges completely worked but
not straightened by percussion flaking but has complete cortex removal from
both faces. A Biface III may be considered finished if the marginal edges have
been further straightened as a result of retouch by soft-percussion flaking.
Thirteen bifacially worked tools and/or tool fragments were recovered
during the course of this project. Of the 13 bifacial tools, four were classified as
Biface I blanks. Three specimens (22-Sm-1256, 22-Sm-1264, and 2-Sm-1270)
were manufactured from Citronelle gravel, while the remaining specimen (22-Sm1262) was manufactured from Tallahatta quartzite . Biface I blanks represent the
initial stages of stone tool manufacture. Lateral edges are partially worked. In
most cases, there is a significant amount of cortex remaining on the specimen.
Biface I blanks in general do not exhibit evidence of utilization. Evidence and
reasons for discard may be apparent in the presence of excessive hinge
fractures along a lateral edge where the biface could not be thinned due to
possible faults in the material.
Eight specimens were classified as Biface II. Five were manufactured
from Citronelle gravel chert (22-Sm-1256, 22-Sm-1262, and 22-Sm-1274) and
three from Tallahatta quartzite (22-Sm-1256 and 22-Sm-1261). These specimens
have lateral edges completely worked but not straightened. Additionally, there
was no utilization present on the specimens.
The final category of biface is the Biface III category. Bifaces falling within
this category have lateral edges worked and straightened. Because these tools
are near to completion, utilization may be present along lateral edges or tips.
Specimens also exhibit small pressure flaking from resharpening activities. Only
one specimen was classified as a Biface III (22-Sm-1261).

79

Triface
A single lithic fragment containing what appear to be three sides was
provisionally classified as a triface. The specimen may simply be the results of
core rejuvenation or biface manufacture. It was recovered from site 22-Sm-1259.
Scrapers
Scrapers were recognized as either end scrapers or side scrapers. As the
name implies, end scrapers are generally a unifacial tool manufactured on the
end of medium to large flakes opposite the bulb of percussion, but they may also
be manufactured from a split cobble or core. Two end scrapers were recovered
during the Smith County 3-D seismic survey. One specimen is manufactured
from an oversized flake (22-Sm-1264), while the other is manufactured at the end
of a split cobble (22-Sm-1262). Five specimens (22-Sm-1256, 22-Sm-1262, 22Sm-1279, and 22-Sm-1292) were classified as side scrapers. Side scrapers are
similar to end scrapers with the exception that utilization occurs on one or both
lateral edges. Giliberti (1995:103) suggests side scrapers are normally hand-held
but may be hafted. Not one of the five specimens appears to have been hafted.
Spokeshaves
Three spokeshaves (22-Sm-1256 and 22-Sm1270) were also recovered
during the Smith County 3-D seismic survey. Spokeshaves are flake tools with
one or more concave edges used in the smoothing of cylindrical objects such as
arrow and spear shafts and bone or wood handles. The specimens are
manufactured from local Citronelle gravels with an edge angle average between
60 degrees and 70 degrees. Gilliberti (1985:108) noted similar measurements
for specimens recovered at the Beaumont Gravel Pit site in Perry County,
Mississippi.
Drills
The final tool to be discussed in this category is the drill or perforator
(Figure 10a-f). A drill is defined as a tool that has a long, narrow, bifacially
worked blade-tip that is often used to cut, puncture, abrade, and be capable of
fast rotations. Seven drills or perforators (22-Sm-1256, 22-Sm-1262, 22-Sm1263, 22-Sm-1264, 22-Sm-1268, and 22-Sm-1292) were recovered during the
Smith County 3-D seismic survey. All are manufactured from Citronelle gravel
chert. Two of the seven specimens are classified as drills (Figure 10a-b), and
one (22-Sm-1264) is classified as a micro-drill. This micro-drill is very small and
almost needle like. Microscopic examination revealed the specimen to be very
abraded and worn presumably as a result of rapid rotations. Two specimens
(Figure 10e-f) are drill fragments.

80

Tested and Split Cobbles
Seven specimens were classified as tested or split cobbles. Of the seven,
one was classified as a tested cobble (22-Sm-1256) and has not been altered by
splitting and contains only flake removals. The remaining six specimens (22-Sm1252, 22-Sm-1256, 22-Sm-1257, 22-Sm-1264, and 22-Sm-1268) have been split
in an attempt to thin the cobble for biface manufacture. All the cobbles are
manufactured from Citronelle gravel chert.

Ground stone tools that are included in this discussion include all
hammerstones and/or grinding stones. Five hammerstones (22-Sm-1257, 22Sm-1263, 22-SM-1270, and 22-SM1278) and one grinding stone (22-Sm-1264)
were recovered during the course of the survey. Three hammerstones are
manufacture from Citronelle gravel chert cobbles. The remaining two specimens
are manufactured from sandstone and quartz, respectively. Hammerstones are
generally associated with stone tool manufacture and maintenance. They may
also be considered a multi-functional tool. Other functions include grinding
vegetable matter, seeds, or grains, and utilization during nut mast harvesting.
Cores
Cores are the parent material from which lithic tools are manufactured.
Percentages of different raw materials cores and core fragments are likely to vary
based on the distance from known quarries. In the project area, the primary raw
material is the local Citronelle gravel chert that can be found in upland settings
and gravel deposits in streams and creeks. Nine cores or core fragments (22Sm-1256, 22-Sm-1260, 22-Sm-1262, 22-Sm-1264, 22-SM-1270, and 22-SM1274) were recovered during the course of this survey. All specimens were
classified as locally available Citronelle gravels.
Debitage
In most Pine Hills excavations, lithic debitage resulting from stone tool
manufacture and maintenance constitutes the majority of artifacts recovered.
Not surprisingly, lithic debitage made up the majority of artifacts recovered during
the Smith County 3-D seismic survey. The total sample was subjected to a data
recording system previously identified in the Laboratory Methods section above.
In order to infer ideas regarding cultural adaptations and organizational
aspects of prehistoric people, many archaeologists employ an organization of
technology approach (Shott 1986; Nelson 1991). The organization of technology
is defined as the relationship between technology, (particularly stone tool
manufacture), use and discard, and the mechanism by which hunter-gatherers
react to changes in their physical environment (Binford 1977, 1978; Nelson
1991).

82

Recently, one avenue archaeologists have focused their attention on, in
respect to organizational aspects of adaptation, is the analysis of lithic debitage.
Lithic debitage analysis provides a tool for assessing variability within and
between prehistoric sites and also provides a view of organizational aspects
related to prehistoric tool manufacture. Variability within assemblages is
assumed to reflect the way lithic technology articulates with particular prehistoric
settlement, mobility, and adaptive strategies. According to Shott (1994), the
analysis of lithic debitage provides as much, or more, information than the formal
and informal chipped stone tools recovered from most archaeological sites.
According to Carr (1995), there are several advantages to using lithic
debitage analysis. First, flake tools are generally not kept by the knapper.
Rather, they are the basis of an expedient technology, thus being discarded at
the place of manufacture and use. Second, and most importantly, stone tool
manufacture is a reductive activity that produces flakes representative of the
general steps of production. Third, because a single knapping episode may
produce very high frequencies of flakes, statistical analysis may be used to infer
patterns of significance. As a result, analysis of lithic debitage can provide
evidence of reduction stage activities at a particular site (Carr 1995).
In lithic debitage analysis, various attributes or combinations of attributes
are recorded and analyzed to ascertain reduction stages or methods of stone tool
production (Magne 1985; Sullivan and Rosen 1985; Ahler 1989; Carr 1995). In
past lithic analysis studies, the primary focus was on the amount of dorsal cortex
retention. Flakes were classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on the
percentage of cortex coverage on the dorsal surface. The approach is often
referred to as the Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary (PST) method. Because
stone tool manufacture is seen as a reductive activity, it was generally believed
that the amount of dorsal cortex was a firm indicator of the production trajectory.
With this in mind, the absence of dorsal cortex would represent later stages in
the production sequence and greater amounts of cortex resulting from earlier
stages of manufacture.
In recent years however, disenchantment with the PST approach has
increased. The disenchantment has encouraged many archaeologists to conduct
lithic reduction experiments, which focuses on a combination of attributes rather
than one individual attribute (Magne 1985; Bradbury and Carr 1995). The
recordation of a combination of attributes is often referred to as a “multiple lines
of evidence” approach, and it has proven to be quite successful in a number of
experiments and lithic analysis studies. It is this approach with which this
analysis was based.

83

In all, 2648 pieces of lithic debitage were recovered during the course of
this survey. The survey was divided into five different study areas (Appendix X).
Study Area 2 produced the bulk of lithic debitage with a total of 1574 pieces,
followed by Study Area 1 (n=387), Study Area 3 (n=372), Study Area 5 (n=286),
and Study Area 4 (n=29).
The 3-D seismic survey was divided into five separated study areas
located in the southwestern corner of the Bienville National Forest. These areas
were numbered from east to west and labeled one through five. As a result, this
provided an opportunity to compare changes that may be present in the
archaeological assemblages from each study area. Study Area 1 was located in
the westernmost portion of the upland saddle between Oakohay Creek and the
Leaf River to the east. Study Area 2 lies within the flood plain and adjacent
uplands of Oakohay Creek and its major tributaries. Study areas 3 and 4 consist
of a vast upland saddle area between Oakohay Creek and Strong River.
Although this area contained numerous creeks and small streams, there were
major creeks present. Study Area 5 consists of the flood plain and adjacent
uplands of Strong River. The lithic debitage analysis was organized by these five
study areas and analyzed as such.
A number of different raw materials were identified during the debitage
analysis.
Not surprisingly, local Citronelle chert gravels dominated the
assemblage contributing 89% (n=2364) to the total assemblage. Other raw
materials identified include quasi-local Tallahatta quartzite at 9% (n=247),
silicified sandstone at 1% (n=15), and Catahoula quartzite at <1% n=1), and nonlocal Kosciusko quartzite at <1% (n=1) and Fort Payne chert at <1% (n=6).
In looking at each study area separately, noticeable differences were
observed for each area’s debitage assemblage. As previously noted above,
Study Area 1 produced 387 pieces of lithic debitage. Of the 387 pieces, 360 or
93% of the sample consisted of local Citronelle gravel. The remaining 7% is
minimally represented by Tallahatta quartzite (n=26) and silicified sandstone
(n=1).
Thirteen archaeological sites and one isolated find contributed to the
debitage assemblage for Study Area 1 (Table 6). Site 22-Sm-1246 produced
42% (n=162) of the total debitage sample for Study Area 1. Other sites producing
a moderate amount of debitage include sites 22-Sm-1247 and 22-Sm-1255, both
of which contributed 17% to the total sample from Study Area 1. The remaining
11 sites produced an average of 11 pieces of debitage.

84

Table 6. Raw Material by Archaeological Site in Study Area 1

The small sample sizes for each of the sites encumbers inferences related
to site function based on inferred reduction stage debitage assignment. However,
when raw data per site is examined, it appears that the majority of archaeological
sites recorded for Study Area 1 represent small, ephemeral or temporary special
purpose camps such as overnight hunting stands or foraging and procurement
camps. Reduction stage assignment, for the most part, falls within the late stage
reduction category with very little early or middle stage debitage. An exception is
site 22-Sm-1246.

85

Reduction stages assigned to the debitage assemblage from 22-Sm-1246
suggest the site may have functioned as a seasonal residential base camp for
mobile hunter-gatherers. Forty percent (n=58) of the debitage was recorded as
late stage reduction followed by early stage at 32% (n=47), middle stage at 25%,
(n=36), and shatter at 3% (n=5). Based on the inferred reduction stage
assignments, the lithic assemblage for 22-Sm-246 appears to represent biface
manufacture and maintenance with some core or initial stage reduction. This
would be the case at a residential base camp where tools would be first
manufactured then subsequently maintained. Additionally, early stage flakes
would be produced during core reduction for usable flake tools.
Thirteen archaeological sites contributed to the debitage assemblage for
Study Area 2 (Table 7). Of the 1574 pieces, 1380 (88% of the sample) consisted
of local Citronelle gravel chert. The remaining 12% is represented by Tallahatta
quartzite (n=180), silicified sandstone (n=11), Catahoula quartzite (n=1),
Kosciusko quartzite (n=1), and Fort Payne chert (n=1).
Archaeological site 22-Sm-1256 produced the majority of the debitage
with 26% (n=421). In addition to artifacts recovered from shovel tests, the
assemblage at this site includes artifacts recovered from three 50 x 50 cm test
pits, contributing to the higher percentage of artifacts. Other sites producing a
moderate to high percentage of artifacts include 22-Sm-261 (n=139), 22-Sm-270
(n=231), 22-Sm-262 (n=123), 22-Sm-1264 (n=285), and 22-Sm-263 (n=216).
Raw data for Study Area 2 produced differing results for site function when
compared to Study Area 1. Inferred reduction stages for each site’s flake
assemblage produced sites classified as temporary special use camps, shortterm base camps, and seasonal residential base camps. Temporary special use
camps include 22-Sm-1257, 22-Sm-1258, 22-Sm-1259, 22-Sm-1260, 22-Sm1271, and 22-Sm-1272. For the most part, these six sites produced very little
debitage, and reduction stages were mostly later stages in the manufacturing
continuums suggesting very little manufacture, only re-sharpening and
maintenance activities. The reduction stage for other sites in Study Area 2 is
presented in Table 8 below.
Only one site was classified as a short term base camp. Site 22-Sm-1265
produced mostly early stage debitage suggesting core manufacture for usable
flake tools or initial biface manufacture. The remaining six sites (22-Sm-1256, 22Sm-1261, 22-Sm-1262, 22-Sm-1263, 22-Sm-1264, and 122-Sm-1270 appear to
represent seasonal residential base camps for mobile hunter-gatherers. Artifact
density was considered high with all stages of manufacture represented in the
debitage assemblages.

86

Table 7. Raw Material by Archaeological Site in Study Area 2

Thirteen archaeological sites and two isolated finds contributed to the
debitage assemblage at Study Area 3 (Table 9). Of the 371 pieces, 360 (97% of
the sample) consisted of local Citronelle gravel chert. The remaining 3% is
represented as Tallahatta quartzite (n=9), and silicified sandstone (n=1).
Site 22-Sm-1278 produced the majority of debitage with 26% (n=98)
followed closely by 22-Sm-1274 at 22% (n=80) and 22-Sm-1279 at 19% (n=74).
The remaining 12 sites produced low-density assemblages and based on
inferred reduction stages. They appear to represent temporary special use
camps similar to the ones described for study areas 1 and 2. Reduction stages
were represented by mostly late stage manufacturing debris. Sites 22-Sm-1259,
22-Sm-1274, and 22-Sm-1279 appear to represent longer-term occupations,
possibly seasonal residential base camps. All stages of biface manufacture and
maintenance, based on debitage analysis, are represented in the assemblages
at sites 22-Sm-1274, 22-Sm-1278, and 22-Sm-1279 in Study Area 3 (Table 10).

87

Table 8. Reduction Stage by Archaeological Site in Study Area 2

Two archaeological sites (22-Sm-1288 and 22-Sm-1289) and four isolated
finds (4-7) contributed to the debitage assemblage of Study Area 4 (Table 11).
This area produced the least amount of artifacts recovered during the course of
the survey. Of the 29 pieces recovered, 28 (99% of the sample) consisted of
local Citronelle gravel chert. A single Tallahatta quartzite flake recovered from
Isolated Find 5 represents the remaining 1%.
Archaeological sites recorded in Study Area 4 represent small, ephemeral
or special purpose sites. Artifact density and diversity are very low. Very little
can be inferred due to the paucity of artifactual debris recovered.
Seven archaeological sites contributed to the debitage assemblage of
Study Area 5 (Table 12). Of the 284 pieces, 248 (87% of the sample) consisted
of local Citronelle gravel chert. The remaining 13% is represented by Tallahatta
quartzite (n=31), silicified sandstone (n=2), and Fort Payne chert (n=5).
Archaeological site 22-Sm-1268 produced the majority of lithic debitage with 37%
of the total sample. Only site 22-Sm-1292 produced a moderate debitage
density (25%). Inferred reduction stages for each site’s flake assemblage
produced sites classified as temporary special use camps, short term base
camps, and seasonal residential base camps. Temporary special use camps
include 22-Sm-1266, 22-SM-1267, 22-Sm-1290, and 22-Sm-1291. These four
sites produced very little debitage and reduction stages were mostly later stages
in the manufacturing continuums suggesting very little manufacture, only resharpening

Only one site was classified as a short-term base camp. Site 22-Sm-1269
produced mostly late stage materials, very little middle stage materials, and a
minority of early stage flakes. The remaining two sites (22-Sm-1268 and 22-Sm1292) appear to represent seasonal residential base camps for mobile huntergatherers. Artifact density was considered moderate to high with all stages of
manufacture represented in the debitage assemblages (Table 13).

CERAMIC ANALYSIS
Introduction
In all, 257 sherds were recovered from the Bienville National Forest during
the Smith County 3-D Seismic Survey. The majority of the sherds (63%) were
recovered from Study Area 2 (n=161) followed by Study Area 5 with 18% (n=47),
Study Area 1 with 13%, and Study Area 3 with 6% (n=16). Study Area 4 did not
produce ceramics. The overall ceramic assemblage is composed of grogtempered sherds (66%), sand-tempered sherds (21%), shell-tempered sherds
(10%), and sherds with bone and grog temper (3%) that ranges in inferred age
from 200 B.C. to A.D. 1100.
Forty-five sherds (18%) demonstrate some form of visible exterior
decoration that could be assigned to a known chronological period, thus
providing a foundation for developing a chronology for site occupations. Exterior
decoration includes pinching or punctation, stamping, incision, and cord marking.
Individual cultural historical types are presented within an overall
chronological framework by period. Within each culture period, ceramic types
are presented in inferred chronological order from earliest to latest. The
discussions will include technological and morphological variables recorded as
part of the data recording process.
Late Gulf Formational Period Decorated Ceramics
Alexander Series
Sand-tempered Alexander series ceramics were recovered during the
course of survey investigations on the Bienville National Forest. They include
Alexander Punctated variety Unspecified (Figure 11).
Three sand-tempered sherds exhibit exterior decoration in the form of
fingernail pinches or punctations. The assemblage consists of two body sherds
and one rim sherd. The decorative technique consists of parallel rows of pinched
or punctated impressions applied by the thumb and index finger. Each parallel
row runs up and down the vessel wall. The vessel rim consists of a straight,
rounded lip and conforms to a vertical beaker vessel form. Small rim size
precludes orifice diameter and vessel size.
Alexander series ceramics are generally considered a product of the
Tennessee and Tombigbee valleys. However, Alexander ceramics (both incised
and punctuate) have been identified in southeast and central Mississippi for a

92

number of years. Only recently they are being more carefully examined on a
local scale (Hodge 2004). In northeast Mississippi, Alexander ceramics date as
early as 800 B.C.

Figure 11. Alexander Punctated Sherds Variety Unspecified
Research conducted by Lehmnann (1990) and Dye and Galm (1986) have
produced an Alexander sequence based on a decorative motif with incising
developing first, followed by pinching and punctating (Hodge 2004). Radiocarbon
analysis from the Sanders site (an Alexander assemblage dominated by incised
vessels) returned dates that ranged between 850 B.C. and 800 B.C. (Lehmann
1990). On the contrary, Dye and Galm’s (1986) Alexander assemblages from the
Sakti, Chaha, and Aralia sites, with pinching and punctating outnumbering
incising, produced radiocarbon dates ranging between 550 B.C. and 400 B.C.
Woodland Stage Ceramics
Marksville Series
Two grog-tempered sherds were classified as Marksville Stamped variety
Unspecified (Figure 12a-b), and four sherds were classified as Marksville Incised
variety Unspecified (Figure 12c-f). The total Marksville assemblage consists of
six body sherds and a single incised rim. For Marksville Incised, decoration
consisted of at least one wide-line incision on the exterior surface of the sherd.
Marksville stamped sherds consisted of at least one wide curvilinear line zoning
areas rocker stamped with a scalloped shell edge.

93

Figure 12. Woodland Stage Ceramics
Marksville series ceramics (including both incised and stamped) are the
second most dominant decorated ceramic identified in southeast and central
Mississippi (Jackson et al. 2002). The overall distribution includes most of
southeast Mississippi with greater representation as one moves south toward the
Gulf Coast. Marksville ceramics generally range in age from between 200 B.C.
during the earlier part of the Woodland Stage to A.D. 600.

94

Alligator Incised
A single grog-tempered sherd was provisionally identified as Alligator
Incised (Figure 13) variety Unspecified. It was identified as a dense grogtempered body sherd. Decoration is consistent with that which is identified by
Phillips (1970:39) and Jenkins (1981) and consists of overlapping incised lines
similar to variety Oxbow. The lines are very disorganized and applied rather
poorly.

Figure 13. Alligator Incised Sherd Variety Unspecified
Phillips (1970) classified Alligator Incised as dating to the Baytown period.
Jenkins (1981) identified Alligator Incised ceramics during the Gainesville Lake
survey and identified them as wet paste incisions over much of the body of the
vessel. Based on his findings, the sherd identified here appears similar to the
ones Jenkins (1981) found during the Gainesville Lake Survey.
Mullberry Creek Cord Marked
Twenty-two grog-tempered sherds were classified as Mulberry Creek Cord
Marked variety Unspecified. The total assemblage consists of 22 body sherds.
The paste is hard and compact unlike the Turkey Paw Cord Marked sherd
discussed below. Additionally, the specimens exhibited a slightly sandy texture.
Ceramic assignment for Mulberry Creek Cord Marked followed sorting criteria
presented by Jenkins (1981). One specimen (a) is illustrated in Figure 14.

95

Figure 14. Middle to Late Woodland Period Sherds
Cord marking as a decorative technique is the most dominate form of
exterior decoration identified for south and central Mississippi. Cord marking is a
Middle to Late Woodland Period manifestation that became the dominant “super
decoration” during the latter half of the Late Woodland Period of Mississippi
prehistory.
Mulberry Creek Cord Marked variety Tallahalla was first defined by
Atkinson and Blakeman (1975) and Atkinson and Elliott (1979) to describe a local
grog-tempered, cord-marked ceramic found predominantly within the confines of
southeast Mississippi. The variety is defined based on the presence of
distinctively thin vessel walls and cord impressions spaced more than a
millimeter apart. Six sherds classified as Mulberry Creek Cord Marked variety
Tallahalla were recovered during the Smith County 3-D seismic survey. All are
body sherds.
The decoration for variety Tallahalla consists of an exterior surface
roughened with a cord wrapped paddle or stick. Cord impressions average a
width of .5 or smaller to 1 mm and presumably cover the entire vessel from base
to rim. Two examples (c-d) are depicted in Figure 14.

96

Turkey Paw Cord Marked
Two specimens were identified as bone-tempered, cord-marked sherds,
specifically Turkey Paw Cord Marked variety Unspecified. Both specimens were
identified as body sherds. One specimen (b) is illustrated in Figure 14. The
decoration for Turkey Paw Cord Marked consists of an exterior surface
roughened with a cord wrapped paddle or stick. Cord impressions average a
width of .5 mm and typically cover the entire vessel from base to rim.
Bone-tempered ceramics were formally defined by Jenkins (1981) during
excavations in the Gainesville Lake area in Sumter, Greene, and Pickens
counties, Alabama. At that time, bone-tempered ceramics were provisionally
classified as Turkey Paw Cord Marked, Turkey Paw Fabric Impressed, and
Turkey Paw Plain because of the small sample recovered. Since that time, bonetempered ceramics have been consistently recovered at southeast Mississippi
archaeological sites. Turkey Paw ceramics not only contain bone and grog but
also have variable amounts of sand and hematite within the paste. Turkey Paw
Cord Marked sherds generally fall within late Middle Woodland to early Late
Woodland time frame circa A.D. 300 to A.D. 800.
Salitillo Fabric Impressed
One sand-tempered, fabric-impressed sherd was provisionally identified
as Saltillo Fabric Impressed (Figure 15a). The specimen was classified as a
body sherd and consists of very faint fabric impressions. Saltillo Fabric
Impressed was first defined by Jennings (1941) as an accompanying ceramic
type to sand tempered Furr’s Cord Marked and Baldwin Plain. Saltillo Fabric
Impressed is generally identified as dating to the Miller I to II periods, which are
equivalent to the Marksville Middle Woodland Period circa 100 B.C. to A.D. 700.
Furr’s Cord Marked
One sand-tempered, cord-marked body sherd was identified as Furr’s
Cord Marked (Figure 15b). The specimen is similar to others recovered in the
immediate area. Furr’s Cord Marked ceramics had a very long use life. Some
archaeologists believe they are very similar to and contemporaneous to Mulberry
Creek Cord Marked ceramics. Furr’s Cord Marked ceramics first appeared
during the early part of the Middle Woodland Period as a minority type, but by the
early Late Woodland period it became the dominant decorated ceramic type
within the Miller culture area along the Tombigbee drainage. By the latter half of
the Late Woodland Period; however, grog as a tempering agent dominated most
assemblages in the area.

97

Figure 15. (a) Saltillo Fabric Impressed and (b) Furr’s Cord Marked Sherds
Unidentified Grog-Tempered Incised
Two grog-tempered specimens were recorded as having a single fine line
incision on the exterior of the vessel wall. Because of the lack of other identifiable
decorative features, the specimens were unable to be sorted into a known type
and/or variety. On example is illustrated in Figure 16.

Figure 16. Unidentified Grog-Tempered Incised Sherd

98

Middle to Late Woodland Period Ceramics
Turkey Paw Plain
Five undecorated sherds tempered with minimal amounts of bone were
recovered during the Smith County 3-D seismic survey. They were classified as
Turkey Paw Plain variety Unspecified. The assemblage includes all body sherds.
The paste is very unconsolidated causing much erosion and pitting on the
exterior surface, similar to the bone-tempered cord-marked types.
Baytown Plain
Undecorated grog-tempered varieties include Baytown Plain variety
Unspecified. In all, 133 Baytown Plain sherds were recovered during the course
of the Smith County 3-D Seismic Survey. The assemblage includes 130 body
sherds, 2 rim sherds, and 1 podal support.
The term Baytown Plain is a broad classification that includes all Middle
and Late Woodland period clay/grog-tempered ceramics (Phillips 1970).
Classification is a broad category based on regional aspects as well. The
unspecified sherds exhibit a combination of coarse and finely crushed grog. A
few specimens also contain hematite either as an intentional or unintentional
tempering additive. The total assemble exhibits a fine sandy paste. Although
mostly fine, exhibiting a finer sandy paste, small, finely crushed grog is evident
although in less than three percent frequency.
Baldwin Plain
Plain sand-tempered ceramics are difficult to confidently place within a
type and/or variety. Sand used as a tempering agent is a common occurrence in
southeast Mississippi, southwest Alabama, and parts of the Tombigbee region.
San-tempered specimens recovered in Greene County were assigned a
type/variety based on Jenkins (1981) sorting criteria. Forty-nine sand-tempered
sherds were classified as Baldwin Plain variety Unspecified. The paste consists
of very fine grain sand particles that are 1 mm or smaller in diameter.
Chronological periods for sand-tempered ceramics range from the Gulf
Formational to the Late Woodland periods. The difficulty in assigning a culture
period was addressed by Jenkins (1981), which led him to combine both O’Neal
Plain (a Gulf Formational Stage type) with Baldwin Plain (a later Woodland type).
Additional complications arise when considering plain sand-tempered ceramics
from the coastal plain area of Mobile, Alabama. There, thick, coarse plain sandtempered sherds are classified as Bayou La Batre, a Gulf Formational Stage type
(Wimberly 1960). In Mississippi, Baldwin Plain variety Unspecified is assigned to
the Miller ceramic sequence beginning with the Miller I period (circa 100 B.C.)
and ending sometime around the close of the Miller II Phase (circa A.D. 600).

99

Mississippian Stage Ceramics
Unidentified Shell-Tempered Incised
A single example of decorated shell-tempered ceramics was identified
during the course of this survey (Figure 17). This specimen consists of fine line
curvilinear incisions on a compact shell tempered paste. The specimen lacks the
characteristic visible shell as well as the cells left behind by its leaching.
Classification is defined by vesicular evidence rather than the actual presence of
shell.
Mississippi Plain
Twenty-five shell-tempered sherds were recovered during the course of
this survey. All specimens were classified as body sherds. Because of the
presence of shell in the paste, the specimens likely represent a terminal Late
Woodland or early Mississippian time frame (circa A.D. 1100 to A.D, 1200).

HISTORIC ARTIFACTS
Introduction
In all, 183 artifacts collected during this survey date to the historic period.
Historic artifacts were collected from six sites; they include 22-Sm-1242, 22-SM1262, 22-Sm-1263, 22-Sm-1281, 22-Sm-1282, and 22-Sm-1283. One hundred
fifty-one artifacts could be sorted into Orser’s functional typology. The remaining
32 specimens were listed as unidentifiable or fragmented and removed from the
study. Historic artifacts recovered include 47 fragments of glass, 46 cut nails, 6
wire nails, 17 brick fragments, 29 ceramic sherds, 32 pieces of unidentified metal
and nail fragments, 1 piece of slate, 1 marble, 3 faunal specimens, and 2 pieces
of coal. The coal may represent the remains of a burned structure. No additional
discussion of the coal follows.
Overwhelmingly, site 22-Sm-1242 produced the majority of historic
materials. This site produced 61% (n=113) of the total historic assemblage
followed by 22Sm-1282 at 27% (n=49), 22-Sm-1283 at 8% (n=14), 22-Sm-1263
at 2% (n=4), 22-Sm-1281 at 2% (n=3), and 22-Sm-1262 at 1% (n=1). Only three
of the six sites were identified as pure, single component historic sites (22-Sm1242, 22-Sm-1282, and 22-Sm-1283). The remaining three sites (22-Sm-1262,
22-Sm-1263, and 22-Sm-1281) were considered isolated historic occurrences
and intruded into better-represented prehistoric component sites. These three
sites provide only minimal representation of the historic period for the area and
contribute more to the prehistoric period. Although site 22-Sm-1283 was
recorded as a single component historic site, based on the artifacts recovered
from shovel tests, it does not conform to a long-term occupation and does not
appear to represent a domestic home site. Considering the long history of
logging in the region during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the three
sparse historic intrusions and site 22-Sm-1283 likely represent the remnants of
ephemeral logging camps and are not considered as historic homesteads. The
two remaining historic component sites are interpreted to be home sites that
were inhabited sometime between the 19th and 20th centuries. These two sites
are presented below as separate analyses.
Site 22-Sm-1242
In comparing the functional categories, household/structural artifacts
dominate the assemblage at site 22-Sm-1242 with 71 specimens (63%) followed
by food related items at 30% (n=34), and personal possessions at 1% (n=1).
Structural/household artifacts include 50 specimens identified as nails, 17
window glass fragments, and four machine-made brick fragments. All
household/structural artifacts fall within the subcategory of architecture and likely
represent the remains of household structures. The functional category of food
related items consists of stone ware at 4% (n=5), earthenware at 13% (n=15),
broken glass fragments at 11% (n=12,), faunal specimens at 2% (n=2).

101

The stoneware fragments fall within the subcategory of food storage while
the earthenware and glass fragments fall within the food service category. The
faunal specimens were classified in the subcategory of remains. The personal
item recovered included a single slate fragment.
One of the best methods employed by archaeologists in determining the
chronological sequence of a site is through the analysis of historic ceramic.
Ceramics from 22-Sm-1242 resemble other assemblages dating from the late
19th century to the early 20th century. Ceramics from this site were sorted into
refined earthen ware and stone ware.
Fifteen white ware sherds were recovered from shovel tests. Twelve were
identified as undecorated. The remaining three specimens consist of one sherd
of blue transfer print (Figure 18a), a piece of fine line polychrome (under glaze)
(Figure 18b), and a sherd of banded annular ware (Figure 18-c). All three
artifacts date to sometime between 1830 and 1900.

Stoneware
Stoneware is one of the most common ceramics recovered from historic
archaeological sites because of its utilitarian nature. Utilitarian stoneware was
available in many different shapes, sizes, and glaze types. Five stoneware
vessel fragments were recovered from 22-Sm-1242. Four sherds were identified
as Albany glaze interior and gray salt-glaze exterior. The remaining sherd was
identified as Bristol brown glaze on the interior and exterior. Dates for the
stoneware sherds range from 1850 to 1900 or later.
Glass
Window glass thickness has been used to date archaeological sites. In
general, window glass is thought to have increased in thickness over time.
Thickness was measured on the 17 fragments recovered from 22-Sm-1242. All
specimens measured 2 mm in thickness providing a date range of 1893 to 1901
with a mean date of 1889 (based on Orser 1988).
Twelve artifacts were classified as container glass, and 17 specimens
were identified as flat window glass fragments. The majority of container glass
(n=10) was unable to be identified as to vessel form or function. One fragment is
clear, six are aqua in color, and the remaining three specimens are amethyst.
The six aqua colored specimens may have originated from canning jars.
Metal
Nails are very common at 19th century and 20th century sites. They also
are the most reliable and accurate tools for dating the undocumented buildings of
the 19th and early 20th centuries. The presence of nails may be the only clear
indicator of the existence of a structure since many wooden buildings rested on
piers that were often moved when the structure was razed. Nails have been
manufactured in three basic forms over the years: hand wrought (forged),
machine cut, and wire (drawn) nails.
Metal objects recovered from site 22-Sm-1242 include 30 complete nails
and 20 nail fragments. Three metal objects could not be identified because of
deterioration. The nail assemblage (including both complete and fragments)
includes 49 machine cut nails and a single wire or drawn nail. No hand wrought
nails were identified. Machine cut nails were initially produced in the late 19th
century. By 1830, machine cut nails were produced with machine stamped
heads, and other improvements were made so that these nails were no longer
brittle and, therefore, could be clinched without breaking (Young and Wright
2000). Wire nails began to appear in constructions circa 1890.

103

Because of the inexpensiveness of wire nails, they quickly replaced cut
nails. By 1913, wire nails represented 90% of all nails in use (Young and Wright
2000). All of the cut nails recovered at this site were machine headed indicating a
date range of 1797-1896. The single wire nail dates from 1890 to the present.
Brick
As brick-making methods changed through time, so did the quality of the
bricks being produced. Four specimens were identified as machine made brick.
While a precise dating of the bricks recovered from 22-Sm-1242 is not possible
(because the bricks are machine made), it is probable that the date of these
items is consistent with those of the other architectural materials.
Miscellaneous Personal Items
A single piece of slate was recovered from 22-Sm-1242. Slate is
considered a part of educational history. During the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, slate was a common item in schools and homes of school children. It
was used as an object to write on and was also used as a writing utensil. Slate
pencils were sharpened on one end and carved into a wedge shape on the other.
The pencil was then inserted into a carved piece of wood (Amy Young, personal
communication). No slate pencils were recovered.
Two faunal specimens were also recovered from 22-Sm-1242. The larger
specimen was confidently identified as the femur of a six to eight-month-old fawn
(H. Edwin Jackson, personal communication). The smaller specimen likely
represents the remains of a deer. Because of the fragmentary nature of the
specimen, this could not be confirmed.
22-Sm-1282
In comparing the functional categories, household/structural items
dominate the assemblage with 34 artifacts (69%) followed by food related items
at 29% (n=14,), and personal items at 2% (n=1). Structural/household artifacts
include 14 specimens identified as nails, 1 window glass fragment, 6 pieces of
unidentified metal, and 13 brick fragments (9 handmade and 4 machine made)
All household/structural artifacts fall within the subcategory of architecture and
likely represent the remains of household structures. The functional category of
food related items consists of earthenware at 36% (n=5), porcelain (n=7), broken
glass fragments at 50% (n=7), and one faunal specimen (7%). The stoneware
fragments fall within the subcategory of food storage while the earthenware and
glass fragments fall within the food service category. The faunal specimens were
classified in the subcategory of remains. The personal item recovered included a
single marble fragment.

104

Earthenware and Stoneware
Five whiteware sherds were recovered from shovel tests at 22-Sm-1282
Three of the whiteware sherds were identified as undecorated. The remaining
two specimens were identified as banded annular ware (Figure 18d) and blue
shell edge ware (Figure 18e). Both date to sometime between 1830-1900.
Glass
Seven artifacts were classified as clear container glass. Because the
specimens were small fragments, it was not possible to identify them as to vessel
form or function. Thickness was measured on the single window glass fragment
recovered from 22-Sm-1282. It measured 2 mm in thickness providing a date
range of 1893 to 1901 with a mean date of 1889 (based on Orser 1988).
Metal
Metal objects recovered from 22-Sm-1282 consisted of complete nails and
nail fragments. Deterioration made it impossible to identify six metal objects. The
nail assemblage (including both complete and fragments) includes 14 machine
cut nails. All the cut nails recovered from 22-Sm-1282 were machine headed
indicating a date range of 1797-1896.
Brick
Thirteen brick fragments were recovered from 22-Sm-1282. Four
specimens were identified as machine made brick, while nine were classified as
made by hand
Miscellaneous Personal Items
A single handmade marble fragment was the only personal item found at
22-Sm-1282. It exhibits a swirl design characteristic of early marbles imported
into or manufactured in the United States. Handmade glass marbles were first
commercially made and manufactured in Germany in 1846. As a result, marbles
were originally imported into the United States from Germany; however, this
practice was interrupted by World War I (1917-1918). Following the war, marbles
were again imported from Germany until circa 1901 when the first marble-making
machine was introduced in the United States (Randal 1971).
Faunal
A single faunal specimen was recovered from site 22-Sm-1282. This
specimen was identified by H. Edwin Jackson (personal communication) as a
fragmentary small mammal long bone. Because of the fragmentary nature of the
specimen, a taxonomic classification was not possible.

105

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Three objectives guided the archaeological investigations during the
course of this project. There were (1) to locate and identify cultural resources
(prehistoric and historic) within the project area, (2) to assess sites in terms of
their potential for listing in the NRHP, and (3) to provide recommendations for all
sites recorded as a result of this survey. The Phase I survey accomplished each
of these goals and provided a basis for evaluating the eligibility of the sites for
listing in the NRHP.
Archival Research
The archival research revealed that numerous cultural resource surveys
have been conducted in the project area. These studies were primarily
conducted by USFS personnel in areas prior to timber sales, construction
projects for recreational projects, and natural disasters such as the recent
Hurricane Katrina. Private contractors work in the forest mainly in relation to oil
and gas activities such as well pads. This task identified 252 previously recorded
archaeological sites in the project area: 200 prehistoric and 49 historic. There
are no data for three sites. The majority of these sites are ineligible for listing in
the NRHP. Those whose eligibility is unknown were identified in the field so the
drillers can avoid them. See Previous Investigations above for more information
regarding past work in the project area.
Field Survey
The field survey encountered thick woods containing mixed hardwoods
and pines as well as various species of under story. Hurricane Katrina had
recently disturbed the area, and a number of trees and limbs were on the ground
as a result. This portion of the forest contains deeply incised streams and steep
hills with elevations ranging from 310 to 570 feet above mean sea level (above
mean sea level) (based on site data). Also, there are a number of natural seep
springs that feed the various creeks.
This survey located and recorded 50 new archaeological sites (Table 14).
Of this number, three (22-Sm-1242, 22-Sm-1282, and 22-Sm-1283) are historic.
Several prehistoric sites have minor historic components, and one flake was
found at historic site 22-Sm-1242. In seven areas, single flakes were found, and
these localities were designated as isolated finds. Two sites (22-Sm-1252 and
22-Sm-1271) are Archaic, and Archaic components are present at four Woodland
sites (22-Sm-1246, 22-Sm-1263, 22-Sm-1268, and 22-Sm-1269). Twenty-nine
sites are purely Woodland or multi-component with Woodland as one of the
components (Table 16). Four sites (22-Sm-1257, 22-Sm-1261, 22-Sm-73, and
22-Sm-74 are described as Gulf Formational (Early Woodland).

Most of the Woodland sites (n=28) date to the Middle Woodland Period or
have a Middle Woodland Period component. Eight date to the Late Woodland
Period or have a Late Woodland Period component. Mississippian Stage
components are present at three sites (22-Sm-1256, 22-Sm-1264, and 22-Sm1270). The Woodland sites are listed in Table 15.
Fifteen sites lack temporally diagnostic artifacts. These sites are classified
as Unknown Prehistoric. Most of these sites only contain debitage and are not
eligible for listing in the NRHP. Two sites, however, yielded large numbers of
flakes in a single shovel tests. They (22-Sm-1254 and 22-Sm-1289) are viewed
as possible special activity areas that may be eligible for listing in the NRHP.
Thirty-one sites are viewed as ineligible for listing in the NRHP, and the eligibility
of 19 sites is unknown. This project shovel tested several thousand source
points. A map depicting the areas surveyed, positive and negative shovel test
data, and shovel test logs for tests excavated at archaeological sites is found in a
compact disk (CD) at the back of this report.
Monitoring of Drilling Operations
Archaeological monitoring during drilling oversaw the relocation of 85
source points. The majority of these were moved to disturbed areas such as fire
lanes or roads and trails, previously surveyed areas, or private land. Fourteen of
the new source point locations were shovel tested. As a result, two previously
unrecorded sites were found (22-Sm-1293 and 22-Sm-1294). These areas as
well as any resulting access testing were added to the “Areas Surveyed Project
Map.” The data cited above does not include these sites that were found after
the artifact analysis was completed. They are, however, discussed below with
the 50 sites found during the survey.
Summary
Isolated finds consisted of single artifacts found in an area where at least
eight shovel tests were excavated. These areas generally consisted of eroded
surfaces and severe post-occupational disturbances in the form of forestry
related activities or modern construction within the proposed project area.
Ineligible sites consisted of small, shallow sites found in a subsurface
context that does not maintain site integrity. The stratigraphy of these sites
reveals soil characteristics for highly disturbed areas. Similar to isolated finds,
these sites appear to suffer from extreme post-occupational disturbances such
as erosional damage as a result of water runoff, forestry and construction
pushpiling, and natural storm damage. Based on these findings, these sites are
not likely to reveal important information, either for the prehistoric or historic
period that would increase the knowledge of the archaeological database for the
area. No further work is recommended for isolated finds or sites deemed
ineligible for listing in the NRHP.

As mentioned above, 19 sites were identified as potentially eligible for
listing in the NRHP. Disturbance levels for these sites were recorded as
moderate to minimal. Moreover, shovel testing revealed that they maintain
stratigraphic integrity in areas and produced moderate to high percentages of
artifacts. The prehistoric sites appear to represent temporary special use camps
and seasonal residential base camps for mobile hunters and gatherers. Only
one historic site was deemed potentially eligible for listing in the NRHP. This site
represents a late 18th century and early 19th century home site. Because these
sites may reveal important information about the state and respective regions in
which they are located, they are recommended as potentially eligible for listing in
the NRHP. They should be protected until their eligibility can be determined
through testing.
Site Descriptions
Fifty archaeological sites (prehistoric and historic) were found as a result
of this survey. Two additional sites were found during the drilling operations.
The following section presents a description of each site including type, age,
size, geographical location, percent and type of vegetation, soil types and
depths, percentage and type of disturbance, distance to nearest water, USFS
Compartment number, name of relevant topographic map, UTM coordinates,
number of shovel tests (positive and negative), elevation, temporary field
number, and artifacts recovered. In addition, a statement regarding the potential
of each site for listing in the NRHP is presented as well as the potential effect on
each site by the USFS. Each site discussion is followed by a map that depicts
the positive and negative shovel tests, features (if present), and landmarks such
as roads and creeks (if present). Each map was drawn to scale and has a north
arrow. Appendix XI consists of shovel test logs for each site and isolated find.
Appendix XII consists of site locations depicted on the USGS 7.5’ topographic
quadrangles. These maps are not for public disclosure.

111

22-Sm-1242
This site consists of 19th and 20th century artifacts found during shovel
testing. It is located on a knoll on an upland ridge at an elevation of 459 feet
above mean sea level overlooking Indian Charlie Branch 380 meters to the north.
An unnamed tributary of Oakohay Creek is 340 meters to the south, and
Oakohay Creek is 1.57 km to the west.
This site is located in Compartment 247 and is depicted on the 7.5’ USGS
topographic quadrangle Raleigh, Mississippi. This site is located in Section 26,
Township 3 North, and Range 7 East. The UTM coordinates are Zone 16 S,
258520 Easting, and 3550983 Northing (North American Datum 1927). The site
map with shovel test locations appears below (Figure 19).
At the time of this survey, the ground cover was 90% and consisted of
mixed hardwoods and pine forest on a knoll on an east west running upland
ridge. The soil in the area has been identified as Sweatman fine sandy loam
(SwD). The house has been demolished, there is an old road in the area, and
the area has been logged. Therefore, disturbance is estimated at 90%.
Fifty-one shovel tests were excavated at the site, and 22 were positive.
Artifacts recovered include one prehistoric gravel flake, cut nails, white ware, a
sherd with a transfer print design, window glass, bottle glass, bricks, and
container glass (some amethyst). A representative soil profile (Shovel Test 5) is
presented below:
Stratum 1 (0-15 cm) sandy loam (10YR 4/1)
Stratum 2 (15-30 cm) sandy loam (10YR 8/3)
Stratum 3 (30+ cm) sandy clay (5YR 4/6)
The size of this site is estimated at 4666 square meters, and it is
classified as a late 19th century and early 20th century habitation site with a
possible prehistoric component of unknown age and function. The old RaleighBurns-Trenton-Lorena public road bounds the site on the south. Two circular
depressions are present, and these may be cisterns. In May 1989, the USFS
reconstructed the top of a circular brick cistern on the site and erected a sign
advising avoidance (Hayman 1989). No shovel testing was conducted by the
USFS in 1989 (personal communication from Terry McClung to William E. Moore
on January 19, 2006). This site is potentially eligible for listing in the NRHP
because of a prior recommendation by Forest Archeologist Samuel O. Brookes
(Price 1989). This site will be avoided; therefore, it will not be affected. The
temporary number assigned in the field was TM-01.

112

113

22-Sm-1243
This site consists of three gravel flakes and one grog-tempered Marksville
Incised sherd found during shovel testing. It is located on the southern toe of the
first terrace at an elevation of 414 feet above mean sea level overlooking Grand
Sir Branch (a tributary of Oakohay Creek) 30 meters to the south and Indian
Charlie Branch 610 meters to the north. Oakohay Creek is 1570 meters to the
west. Site 22-Sm-1243 is located in Compartment 247 and is depicted on the
7.5’ USGS topographic quadrangle Raleigh, Mississippi. It is located in Section
26, Township 3 North, and Range 7 East.
The UTM coordinates are Zone 16 South 259230 Easting, and 3550618
Northing (North American Datum 1927). The site map with shovel test locations
appears below (Figure 20).
At the time of this survey, the ground cover was 90% and consisted of
mixed hardwoods. The soil in the area has been identified as Smithdale fine
sandy loam (SdD). Disturbance in the area is estimated at 25% due to forestry
activities. Nineteen shovel tests were excavated at the site, and three were
positive. A representative soil profile (Shovel Test 8) is presented below:
Stratum 1 (0-10 cm) sandy loam (10YR 4/1)
Stratum 2 (10-35 cm) sandy loam (10YR 7/3)
Stratum 3 (35-40 cm) sandy clay (10YR 6/6)
The size of this site is estimated at 100 square meters, and it is classified
as Middle Woodland Period site based on the Marksville Incised sherd. This site
may have functioned as a temporary special use camp. This site is not eligible
for listing in the NRHP because of the paucity of artifacts. This site will be
avoided; therefore, it will not be affected. The temporary number assigned in the
field was MG-02.

22-Sm-1244
This site consists of 11 gravel flakes and one Edwards Stemmed arrow
point/knife made of Tallahatta quartzite) found during shovel testing. It is located
on an upland ridge at an elevation of 515 feet above mean sea level overlooking
Cantwell Branch 100 meters to the north and an unnamed tributary of Cantwell
Branch 420 meters to the south. This site is located in Compartment 247 and is
depicted on the 7.5’ USGS topographic quadrangle Raleigh, Mississippi. Site 22Sm-1244 is located in Section 24, Township 3 North, and Range 7 East. The
UTM coordinates are Zone 16 S, 260402 Easting, and 3552105 Northing (North
American Datum 1927). The site map with shovel test locations appears below
(Figure 21).
At the time of this survey, the ground cover was 90% and consisted of
mixed hardwoods and pine forest. The soil in the area has been identified as
Smithdale fine sandy loam (SdD). Disturbance in the area is estimated at 80%
due to forestry activities and erosion. Ten shovel tests were excavated at the
site, and four were positive. A representative soil profile (Shovel Test 9) is
presented below:
Stratum 1 (0-5 cm) sandy loam (10YR 4/2)
Stratum 2 (5-35 cm) sandy loam (10YR 5/6)
Stratum 3 (35+ cm) sandy clay (2.5YR 5/6)
The size of this site is estimated at 1261 square meters, and it is classified
as Middle to Late Woodland Period site based on the presence of the Edwards
stemmed arrow point. This site may have functioned as a temporary special use
camp. It is not eligible for listing in the NRHP because of the paucity of artifacts
and amount of disturbance (80%). This site will be avoided; therefore, it will not
be affected. The temporary number assigned in the field was DP-02.

22-Sm-1245
This site consists of eight gravel chert lakes found during shovel testing. It
is located on an upland ridge at an elevation of 458 feet above mean sea level
overlooking Cantwell Branch 150 meters to the northeast and an unnamed
tributary of Cantwell Branch 100 meters to the southwest. This site is located in
Compartment 247 and is depicted on the 7.5’ USGS topographic quadrangle
Raleigh, Mississippi. Site 22-Sm-1245 is located in Section 23, Township 3
North, and Range 7 East. The UTM coordinates are Zone 16 S 259664 Easting,
and 3552122 Northing (North American Datum 1927). The site map with shovel
test locations appears below (Figure 22).
At the time of this survey, the ground cover was 90% and consisted of a
sparse mature pine forest with a dense under story on a northwest-running ridge.
The soil in the area has been identified as Smithdale fine sandy loam (SdD).
Disturbance in the area is estimated at 80% due to forestry activities
Twenty-one shovel tests were excavated at the site, and four were
positive. The depth of soils overlying the clay subsoil is 30 cm. A representative
soil profile (Shovel Test 5) is presented below:
Stratum 1 (0-5 cm) sandy loam (10YR 3/3)
Stratum 2 (5-30 cm) sandy loam (10YR 7/3)
Stratum 3 (30+ cm) sandy loam (5YR 5/8)
The size of this site is estimated at 75 square meters. It is classified as an
unknown prehistoric site based on a lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts. Its
age and function are unknown. This site is not eligible for listing in the NRHP
because of the paucity of artifacts and amount of disturbance (80%). This site will
be avoided; therefore, it will not be affected. The temporary number assigned in
the field was DP-01.

22-Sm-1246
This site consists of stone tools, ceramics, and debitage found during
shovel testing (Table 16). The site is located on an upland ridge at an elevation
of 524 feet above mean sea level overlooking Nelse Creek 300 meters to the
east. This site is located in Compartment 241 and is depicted on the 7.5’ USGS
topographic quadrangle Raleigh, Mississippi. Site 22-Sm-1246 is located in
Section 31, Township 3 North, and Range 8 East. The UTM coordinates are
Zone 16 S, 262540 Easting and 3548644 Northing (North American Datum
1927). The site map with shovel test locations appears below (Figure 23).
Table 16. Artifacts from 22-Sm-1246

At the time of this survey, the ground cover was 90% and consisted of
mixed hardwoods and a mature pine forest. The soil in the area has been

tributaries of Roberts Creek 50 meters to the north and 50 meters south at an
elevation of 390 feet above mean sea level. The confluence of these tributaries is
100 meters to the east. This site is located in Compartment 276 and is depicted
on the 7.5’ USGS topographic quadrangle Raleigh, Mississippi. It is located in
Section 32, Township 3 North, and Range 7 East. The UTM coordinates are
Zone 16 South, 254385 Easting, and 3549906 Northing (North American Datum
1927). The site map with shovel test locations appears below (Figure 38).
At the time of this survey, the ground cover was 90% and consisted of a
plantation of mature pines and forest of mixed hardwoods. The soil in the area
has been identified as Savannah fine sandy loam (SaB). Disturbance in the area
is estimated at 30% due to forestry activities and erosion. Ninety-eight shovel
tests were excavated at the site, and 45 were positive. A representative soil
profile of the lower portion of the site (Shovel Test 52) is presented below:
Stratum 1 (0-10 cm) sandy loam (10YR 3/3)

The size of this site is estimated at 10,647 square meters. It is classified
as Middle Woodland Period site due to the various ceramics present. There are
not enough temporally diagnostic artifacts to date the historic component. It may
have functioned as a seasonal residential base camp. This site is potentially
eligible for listing in the NRHP because of the large number of artifacts and
relatively little amount of disturbance. This site will be avoided; therefore, it will
not be affected. Two temporary numbers were assigned to this site in the field.
They are KU-03 and KU-04.

The size of this site is estimated at 11,911 square meters. The prehistoric
component is classified as Late Archaic based on the spear points and Middle
Woodland based on the presence of plain grog-tempered sherds. It may have
functioned as a seasonal residential base camp. The historic component is
classified as a 20th century farmstead. This prehistoric component is potentially
eligible for listing in the NRHP because of the presence of a Lower Mississippi
Valley sherd (Alligator Incised) and two Turkey Paw sherds (a type not commonly
found in the area), and the possibility of activity areas. Robert Bryan (1996)
evaluated several dipping vats in the forest and determined that dipping vat 1
(Figure 39) was not eligible for listing in the NRHP because of its poor condition.
He referred to this vat in his report as 96-243-BV-15H, and he determined that
dipping vat 2 (Figure 39) was potentially eligible for listing in the NRHP because
of its “good state of preservation.” This site will be avoided; therefore, it will not
be affected. The temporary number assigned in the field was MG-04.

This site consists of five flakes found during shovel testing. It is located on
an upland ridge at an elevation of 390 feet above mean sea level overlooking an
unnamed tributary of Coon Creek approximately 76 meters to the south. This site
is located in Compartment 280 and is depicted on the 7.5’ USGS topographic
quadrangle White Oak, Mississippi. It is located in Section 26, Township 3 North,
and Range 6 East. The UTM coordinates are Zone 16 South, 249760 Easting,
and 3550245 Northing (North American Datum 1927). The site map with shovel
test locations appears below (Figure 52).
At the time of this survey, the ground cover was 90% and consisted of a
forest of mixed hardwoods and mature pine. The soil in the area has been
identified as Smithdale fine sandy loam (SdD). Disturbance in the area is
estimated at 30% due to forestry activities and erosion. Twelve shovel tests were
excavated at the site, and three were positive. A representative soil profile
(Shovel Test 6) is presented below:
Stratum 1 (0-7 cm) sandy loam (10YR 4/3)
Stratum 2 (7-50 cm) sandy loam (10YR 5/8)
Stratum 3 (50-55+) sandy clay (5YR 5/8)
The size of this site is estimated at 131 square meters. It is classified as
an unknown prehistoric site due to an absence of temporally diagnostic artifacts.
Its age and function are also unknown. This site is not eligible for listing in the
National of Historic Places because of a paucity of artifacts. This site will be
avoided; therefore, it will not be affected. The temporary number assigned in the
field was JN-04.
Comments:
Although only five flakes were found at this site, which occupies the western
edge of a narrow ridge, additional artifacts have been found along the rest of the
ridge. The extreme eastern end of this ridge has been designated as 22-Sm569, and the Forest Service has identified two additional areas in the middle of
this ridge as sites BNF 1 and BNF 2. BVRA believes that additional shovel tests
may reveal the entire ridge to be the same site. Newly recorded site JH-01
(BVRA 06-33) is located approximately 175 meters south-southwest on the next
ridge across the unnamed tributary to the south.

Comments:
This historic farmstead is situated within a forest of mature pines and mixed
hardwoods on a southwest bearing upland ridge top knoll facing what is probably
an old county road 50 meters to the east. The historic site is indicated by the
presence of overgrown privet and daffodils on the knoll. Additionally, there are
several architectural features present. These include a stone-lined well on the
south slope of the knoll, a largely intact fireplace hearth on the knoll summit, the
remains of a brick structure approximately half-way up the south of the knoll, and
a circular depression with associated sandstone and brick rubble (2 meters in
diameter) located 25 meters northeast of the house remains about half-way down
the north facing slope.

A single grave marker inscribed “Charlie Gordon/December 19, 1875/Age 44
yrs.” Is located approximately 200 meters north of the house site. The site of
Boykin Church (destroyed by fire) is 2500 feet (762 meters) northeast of the site.
A historical marker at this site states:
“Boykin Methodist Church, built ca. 1827-30, was constructed by members of the
Robert and John Boykin families. At one time, Lauchlin McLaurin, father of Gov.
Anselm McLaurin worshiped here. The congregation was active until about
1928. The adjacent cemetery also served the now extinct Boykin Church
Community.”
It is possible that Charlie Gordon was once one of the now extinct Boykin Church
community mentioned on the historical marker. If the house site at 22-Sm-1282
belonged to the Charlie Gordon family, this site may be eligible for listing in the
NRHP under Criterion D of Section 106.
