“Eighty Years of Paleoindian Research on the Southern Plains; What Do We know and
Where are We Heading?: A View from the Clovis Site.”
PAS November 16 Guest Speaker George Crawford
Abstract
In significant ways, research into the First Americans has come full-circle from
a broad search to understand changing climate, biodiversity, and human interactions at the end of the last glacial maximum, through a period of processual
excavations, and back to a big picture of landscape archaeology. A real understanding of prehistory comes, not from collecting spear points and animal
bones, but from understanding as much as possible about the landscape,
weather, plants, and animals that make up the sphere of human interaction.
The Clovis site is perhaps best known as the place where humans were proven
to have killed and butchered mammoths and other Pleistocene megafauna on a
marshy plain, but it is much more than a typical kill-site. The Clovis site is situated in a unique geologic/geographic position of eolian aggradation and extreme stability, preserving pollen, diatoms, osteological, and stratigraphic data as well as the more
usual array of artifacts and features associated with large multi-component sites. After all this time,
we are just beginning to grasp it’s full potential.
George Crawford is the current Director of the Blackwater Draw National Historic Landmark, (a.k.a. the
Clovis type site). Crawford has long had interests in pre-industrial subsistence strategies, tool kits, and
craftsmanship. His early academic research was almost exclusive to Atlantic Europe and North Africa,
but for practical reasons changed focus to the prehistory of North America, ultimately becoming interested in the earliest cultures of the Americas. His current work focuses on the interactions of the Southern High Plains and the American Southwest as well as our evolving knowledge of the effects of climate
change on hunter-gatherers.
Professional work: Received both B.A. and M.A. from University of Missouri and has worked professionally as an archaeologist for the past 24 years. He served briefly as Project Archaeologist and Cartographer for a contract archaeology firm in Oxford, England while finishing graduate school and soon thereafter joined the staff of the Office of the State Archaeologist of Iowa. He worked at the Center for Archaeological Research at Missouri State University and was involved in several large excavations including very early Paleoindian research. Later, he took a position at the Clovis site working on field projects in New Mexico and Texas while serving as Adjunct Faculty at Eastern New Mexico University. During this time he created the first comprehensive map of the Clovis site and surrounding landscape, and
developed a master plan for future management of the National Landmark. When the position ended,
Crawford worked for several years on Federal and State archaeological contracts in California, Arizona,
Utah, New Mexico, Texas, Illinois, Missouri, and North Dakota involving large cultural resource surveys
and extensive excavations of sites ranging in age from Paleoindian through contact period Plains Vil-

Armstrong County Museum – A Lot in a Little Town
By Donna Otto

The Armstrong County Museum complex includes the Museum, Art Gallery, the historic Gem Theatre and the Goodnight Historical Center. The main museum complex in located in Claude, Texas, at 121
Trice Street and they are open 12 to 4 Tuesday through Saturday or by appointment. The Goodnight Historical
Center is located approximately 12 miles east of Claude on US Hwy 287 at 4901 County Rd. 25, Goodnight,
Texas, and operated from 10 to 5 Tuesday through Saturday or by appointment.
Museum exhibits include sections with artifacts on the early days of Claude, Texas, from its earliest pictures of buildings to displays of a General Store, Doctor’s Office, typical bedroom and dining room settings,
and a Blacksmith Shop. They include exhibits of the prehistoric occupation, early Spanish exploration and
Native American tribes of the area. Pioneer Families have contributed displays of early settlers and trace the
history of the early families, giving insight into the daily life and history of Texas and Armstrong County.
A section of the museum is identified as Goodnight Hall and includes a history of the JA Ranch. There is
also the Hall of Honor identifying men and women of Armstrong County who have served our country in uniform.
Across the street from the Museum is located the Lake Center School – 1916-1920 schoolhouse with period
furnishings. You will also find here a Line Shack and Windmill.
Part of the Armstrong County Museum includes the Art Gallery where local and regional artist shows are
held. The current show exhibits Armstrong County resident photographers’ display of work they entered in
the Fair. The Gem Theatre (1915) has live entertainment through the year with upcoming events including the
Marshall Ford Swing Band (Nov. 2) and a presentation of The Best Christmas Pageant Ever (Dec. 7). These
events are reasonably priced and a real pleasure to attend.
Their latest addition to the Museum Complex is The Charles Goodnight Historical Center and J. Evetts Haley Visitor and Education Center. This center has cutting edge exhibits explaining the historical importance of
The Charles and Mary Ann Dyer Goodnight House (1887), Goodnight’s ranch and cattle enterprise, and Mary
Ann Goodnight’s southern herd of bison. The center includes video interviews about the Goodnights and the
Ranch. The refurbished Goodnight home includes period furnishings, pictures, quilts, clothing and other decorative items. Interpretations include samples of original wallpapers and pictures of original furnishings. Next
door to the Historical Center are bison – descendants of the original Goodnight herd.
This small town has packed a lot of punch in their presentation of the history of Armstrong County and its
pioneers. It is a pleasurable visit only a short distance from Amarillo. For an excellent presentation of what to
expect and the dates and times of upcoming events, please visit their wonderful website:
