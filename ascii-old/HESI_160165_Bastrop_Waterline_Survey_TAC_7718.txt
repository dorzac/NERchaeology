Bastrop Waterline Project in Bastrop County, Texas

ABSTRACT

On 25 October 2016, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted cultural
resources investigations along a proposed waterline right-of-way (ROW) located on the south
side of Bastrop in Bastrop County, Texas (Project Area). The City of Bastrop is proposing the
construction of approximately 1.1 miles (1.8 kilometers [km]) of new water pipeline in order to
provide an additional potable water feed to areas of Bastrop on the west side of the Colorado
River. The proposed water line would be installed within existing utility easements bordering the
north side of the State Highway (SH) 71 frontage road. As the undertaking would be located on
public property, it would fall under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In
addition, the proposed water line would be installed via a horizontal direction drill (HDD)
beneath the Colorado River. As the Colorado River is a Section 10 waterway at this location,
the HDD beneath the river channel would require the utilization of a Nationwide Permit (NWP)
issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). As NWPs are federal permits, the portion
of the undertaking under the purview of the USACE would also fall under the regulations of
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. At the
request of the City of Bastrop, Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations within the
Project Area in compliance with the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the
investigations was to determine if any significant archeological deposits are located within the
Project Area and, if any exist, to determine if the project would have the potential to have any
adverse effects on sites eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or
sites listed on or considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The cultural resources investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) permit no. 7818.
As the Project Area extends along the northern edge of the SH 71 frontage road, the
cultural resources investigations resulted in the observation that the vast majority of the Project
Area has been previously impacted by roadway and infrastructure construction, utility
installation, and various other forms of modern development. Because of this, the field
assessment failed to find any location retaining the potential for intact cultural deposits within
the portion of the proposed ROW that would utilize open-cut trenches for construction.
Additionally, backhoe trenching and shovel testing efforts within the HDD bore entry/exit
locations on opposing sides of the Colorado River produced entirely negative results for
subsurface cultural deposits.

Abstract

Based on the results of the cultural resources investigations, it is Horizon’s opinion that
the construction of the proposed water line would pose no adverse effects to significant cultural
resources that are eligible for formal designation as SALs or that are listed on or considered
eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that the undertaking be allowed
to proceed relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT, the USACE, and Section 106 of the NHPA.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance within the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location
of the discovery should cease immediately, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should
be notified of the discovery.

Bastrop Waterline Project in Bastrop County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of cultural resources investigations conducted along a
proposed water pipeline right-of-way (ROW) located on the south side of Bastrop in Bastrop
County, Texas (Project Area) (Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The City of Bastrop is proposing the
construction of approximately 1.1 miles (1.8 kilometers [km]) of new water line in order to
provide an additional potable water feed to areas of Bastrop on the west side of the Colorado
River. The proposed water line would be installed within existing utility easements bordering the
north side of the State Highway (SH) 71 frontage road. As the undertaking would be located on
public property, it would fall under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In
addition, the proposed waterline would be installed via a horizontal direction drill (HDD) beneath
the Colorado River. As the Colorado River is a Section 10 waterway at this location, the HDD
beneath the river channel would require the utilization of a Nationwide Permit (NWP) issued by
the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). As NWPs are federal permits, the portion of the
undertaking under the purview of the USACE would also fall under the regulations of Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. At the request of
the City of Bastrop, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural
resources investigations within the Project Area in compliance with the ACT and Section 106 of
the NHPA. The purpose of the investigations was to determine if any significant archeological
deposits are located within the Project Area and, if any exist, to determine if the project would
have the potential to have any adverse effects on sites eligible for formal designation as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or sites listed on or considered eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The cultural resources investigations were conducted
under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit no. 7818.
The undertaking consists of the installation of a 16.0-inch- (40.6-centimeter- [cm])
diameter water pipeline across the Colorado River. The water line ROW totals approximately
1.1 miles (1.8 km) in length and approximately 10.0 feet (3.0 meters [m]) in width (1.3 acres). It
would be installed within existing, heavily disturbed utility easements (many of which are capped
with concrete or asphalt) along the north side of the SH 71 frontage road. Roughly half-way
along the route, an HDD would be utilized for installation below the channel of the Colorado
River. Due to the heavily disturbed nature of the majority of the proposed ROW, the HDD bore
entry/exit boxes were the only locations along the route that were deemed to have any potential
for containing intact cultural deposits.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, general
reconnaissance assessment of the length of the proposed ROW, backhoe trenching and shovel
testing efforts within the proposed HDD bore entry/exit boxes, and the production of a report
suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the
Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27,
and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management
Reports. Russell K. Brownlow (Horizon’s Cultural Resources Director) served as the project’s
Principal Investigator. He and Jared Wiersema (Horizon staff archeologist) conducted the field
investigations.
Horizon conducted the assessment of the Project Area on 25 October 2016. Because
the Project Area consists predominantly of an existing, heavily disturbed utility easement that is
covered in large part by concrete or asphalt, only a general reconnaissance assessment (visual
inspection and photo-documentation) was conducted along the vast majority of the Project Area
in order to document the existing disturbances and lack of potential for any intact cultural
deposits. The areas retaining the only potential for buried cultural deposits are the HDD bore
entry/exit locations on opposing sides of the Colorado River. As such, the cultural resources
investigations focused on these 2 HDD areas. The HDD bore entry on the west bank of the
Colorado River is situated on a cleared, lower terrace where deep alluvial deposits are present.
To assess this location, the field crew excavated 2 backhoe trenches within the proposed HDD
bore entry box. The eastern HDD bore exit is located on an artificially cut slope on the edge of
a private residence’s lawn. Because this location consists of (1) an extreme slope that
precluded the placement of a backhoe; (2) the edge of a manicured lawn; and (3) a utility
easement containing several existing utility lines that could be damaged by mechanical
excavation, the field crew visually inspected the cut slope of the landform for cultural materials
and excavated 1 shovel test within the existing utility easement.
As the Project Area extends along the northern edge of the SH 71 frontage road, the
cultural resources investigations resulted in the observation that the vast majority of the Project
Area has been previously impacted by roadway and infrastructure construction, utility
installation, and various other forms of modern development. Because of this, the field
assessment failed to find any location retaining the potential for intact cultural deposits within
the portion of the proposed ROW that would utilize open-cut trenches for construction.
Additionally, backhoe trenching and shovel testing efforts within the HDD bore entry/exit
locations on opposing sides of the Colorado River produced entirely negative results for
subsurface cultural deposits.
Based on the results of the cultural resources investigations, it is Horizon’s opinion that
the construction of the proposed waterline would pose no adverse effects to significant cultural
resources that are eligible for formal designation as SALs or that are listed on or considered
eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that the undertaking be allowed
to proceed relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT, the USACE, and Section 106 of the NHPA.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area is located on the south side of Bastrop, Texas, extending along the
north side of the SH 71 frontage road. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS)
Bastrop, Texas, 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1-1). The project consists of a
16.0-inch (40.6-cm) diameter water line that would be installed within an existing utility
easement measuring approximately 1.1 miles (1.8 km) in length and approximately 10.0 feet
(3.0 m) in width (1.3 acres).
The western end initiates at an existing water line on the east side of Eskew Street
(Figure 2-1). From there, the water line extends eastward within existing, heavily disturbed
utility easements (many of which are capped with concrete or asphalt) along the north side of
the SH 71 frontage road (Figures 2-2 to 2-4). Roughly half-way along the route, the water line
approaches the Colorado River, where an HDD would be utilized for installation below the river
channel. The western HDD bore entry is situated on a flat, cleared lower terrace that appears to
have been heavily modified in the past for bridge construction (Figures 2-5 and 2-6). A large
spoil pile is present at this location, and a portion of it was recently removed, coincidentally
allowing access to the proposed HDD box (see Figures 2-5 and 2-6). The eastern HDD bore
exit is located on an artificially cut slope on the edge of a private residence’s lawn on the high
terrace of the river (Figures 2-7 and 2-8). From the HDD bore exit, the water line continues
eastward within existing, heavily disturbed utility easements, terminating at another existing
water line just east of Toliver Street in front of a Popeye’s restaurant (Figures 2-9 to 2-12).
As can be seen in Figures 2-1 to 2-12, the entire length of the Project Area, aside from
the HDD bore box on the west side of the Colorado River, is situated within existing, previously
disturbed roadway, utility, and drainage easements that retain little to no potential for containing
intact cultural deposits.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is situated on generally flat terraces on opposing sides of the Colorado
River on the south side of the City of Bastrop. The western portion lies on the lower terrace
within a bend in the river, while the eastern portion is on the high terrace above the river.

Elevations within the Project Area range between approximately 320.0 and 390.0 feet
(97.6 and 118.9 m) above mean sea level. Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the
Colorado River Basin. The majority of the Project Area drains directly into the Colorado River
via overland sheet flow. The eastern end is drained by a channelized stretch of Gills Branch
that flows southwesterly and joins the Colorado River just a short distance south of the Project
Area.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to 5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Bastrop County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate
is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas
manifest regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east
to west and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast
(Larkin and Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to
subtropical subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 32.0 inches (81.3 cm) and
temperature averages 67°Fahrenheit (F) (19°Celsius [C]) annually, ranging from 96°F (36°C) in
August (the warmest month) to 59°F (15°C) in January (the coldest month). During this time,
however, drier periods lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 12.0 to
25.0 inches (30.5 to 63.5 cm), were followed by abnormally wet years with 45.0 to 50.0 inches
(114.3 to 127.0 cm) of rainfall.

14

Cultural Resources Investigations along a Proposed
Bastrop Waterline Project in Bastrop County, Texas

Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall.
Two extreme examples are the excess of 36.0 inches (91.4 cm) of rain that fell within an 18hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 22.0-inch (55.9-cm)
deluge that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935. Lower rainfall amounts
are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so frequently that
there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from west to east
often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture is derived
from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into
the region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian
provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943).
Some species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The
boundary, characterized as “approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian
provinces passes through western Williamson County, northwest of the APE. Rainfall in the
Texan province is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified as a C2 (moist
subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.
Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica),
and hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this
soil type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas
include the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies. Some characteristic associations of the
Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a mixed stand of loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda) and blackjack and post oak in Bastrop County, as well as a series of peat
and bog marshes distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At
least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert
pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens),
white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern
cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis

mephitis), ground squirrel (Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana),
hispid pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), blacktailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), 9-banded armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), and jaguar (Felis onca). Both species of Terrapene known from the
Austroriparian province—eastern box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle (T. ornata)—
occur in the Texan.
Sixteen species of lizards, including 7 grassland and 9 forest species, are also found,
including green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates),
common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale), and glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis)
(grassland species), as well as collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Texas spiny lizard
(Sceloporus olivaceous), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Great Plains skink
(Eumeces obsoletus) (forest species). Only 5 species of urodele fauna are known from this
area, including small-mouthed salamander (Ambystoma texanum), tiger salamander
(Ambystoma tigrinum), and eastern lesser siren (Siren intermedia), and the Texan province acts
as a barrier to urodele distribution between the endemic Balconian province fauna to the west
and the Austroriparian fauna to the east.
Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely distributed
species, including eastern spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern
chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea),
North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and narrowmouthed toad (Microhyla carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross from the
Texan into the Austroriparian province include Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia), Strecker’s
chorus frog (Pseudacris streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea). Other reptile
and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include 6-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis
sexlineata), rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos), rough
green snake (Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), western diamondback
rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris crepitans), diamondback water
snake (Nerodia rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis).
Common bird species include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), killdeer (Charadrius
vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos).
Although small herds of bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and
early historic periods, these species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:1314).

Cultural Resources Investigations along a Proposed
Bastrop Waterline Project in Bastrop County, Texas

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The APE is located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological Region.
The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of North
America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through
time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the
Buttermilk Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis
culture may have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al.
2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point
styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late
PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture
shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of
groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most
markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the
Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In
addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute
evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially
accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas occurred in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay;
however, de Vaca did not approach the Colorado River basin or the Bastrop region. It was not
until 1691, when Domingo Terán de los Ríos led an expedition along the route that became
known as the Camino Real, that exploration of this region began.
In the late 17th century, natives from northern Mexico and southern Texas began
migrating into Central Texas to escape forced occupation and labor in the Spanish mines and
missions and on Spanish ranches. At approximately the same time, horses stolen from the
Spanish had become an integral part of the Apache way of life. These mounted, nomadic bison
hunters of the High Plains enjoyed a tremendous advantage over their pedestrian enemies.
They terrorized native groups to the east and southeast of their High Plains homeland, forcing
many to flee, some into Central Texas (Newcomb 1993:2). Thus, the first Europeans into the
region encountered native groups fragmented by the growth of the Spanish missions, the raids
of the Apache, and the diseases that swept before the physical presence of Europeans. Their
accounts, therefore, do not provide direct analogues to prehistoric cultural patterns, but rather
represent a time of drastic cultural change (Collins 1995). A few indigenous cultural patterns
may have prevailed through time. Large, diffuse encampments composed of peoples with
mixed ethnic affiliations and small, band-sized residential camps date to this particular period in
Central Texas (Collins 1995:386). The smaller sites may represent indigenous groups.
Historical documents dating from the 1730s to 1800 make reference to remnants of
native groups living in the missions, primarily in Bexar County (Collins 1995). Toward the end of
this timeframe, the Comanche began to move into Northwestern Texas from the high plains.
Records of their presence in Central Texas at this time tend to be highly biased since they were
provided mostly from the hostile perspective of Anglo settlers (Collins 1995).
During the early part of the 19th century, the Native American presence in Central Texas
was composed of small numbers of mission Indians, “far flung nomadic native groups (primarily
the Comanche)” (Collins 1995:387), with EuroAmerican settlers becoming increasingly
common. The Comanche presence began fading in the mid- to late 19th century. Their final
expulsion heralded the end of Native American presence in Central Texas.
In 1804, a Spanish fort was built on the Old San Antonio Road Colorado River crossing.
The self-proclaimed Baron of Bastrop, a German immigrant who had been given permission by
the Mexican government to settle near this crossing, established the settlement of Bastrop in
1823. Further attempts to settle the area failed until a new settlement was established by
Stephen F. Austin in 1827. Many well known Texas pioneers first settled in the Bastrop area.
One of these early settlers, James Burleson, owned a parcel of land that would become a
portion of Buescher State Park. The population of the Bastrop settlement at the time of the
Texas Revolution was around 400 individuals.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

The railroad came to Bastrop in the early 1870s and helped establish logging as the
major local economic activity. Iron, coal, and manufacturing became important industries by the
late 19th century. By 1900, the population of Bastrop County had increased to 26,845, up from
around 7,000 at the start of the Civil War.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

DATABASE REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of 12 previously recorded archeological sites,
2 cemeteries, 1 address-restricted NRHP district, and 126 historic properties listed on the NRHP
within an approximately 1.0-mile radius of the proposed HDD span across the Colorado River
(THC 2016), while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer
indicated the presence of the majority of the same NRHP properties within the review perimeter
(NPS 2016). These documented cultural resources and their distances from the Colorado River
HDD span are summarized in Table 4-1, while their locations relative to the Project Area are
presented in Figure 4-1. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys
have been conducted within the boundaries of the current Project Area.
As can be seen in Figure 4-1, no documented archeological sites or cemeteries are
located in immediate proximity to the Project Area. The only documented cultural resource
mapped in proximity to the Project Area on the Atlas database is the Alf Jung House. This
residential structure is a historic property listed on the NRHP. The address listed within its
NRHP description is 508 Pecan Street, which places it 1 block north of the Project Area at the
southwest corner of Pecan and Emile streets. A review of Google Earth confirms the presence
of the historic structure at the southwest corner of Pecan and Emile streets. It also reveals the
presence of a modern butane/propane business at the mapped location of the Alf Jung House
on the Atlas database (Figure 4-2). As the map symbol for this NRHP property is at the wrong
location on the Atlas database, there are no documented cultural resources in immediate
proximity to the current Project Area.

4.2

MAP REVIEW

A review of historic aerial imagery containing the Project Area found that the available
imagery dates only as far back as 1995. This imagery showed little change along the route of
the Project Area aside from the widening of SH 71 across the Colorado River, as well as the
construction of the associated turnaround lanes on the west side of the river.

While the aerial imagery was available for only the past few decades, USGS topographic
quadrangles were available for the years between 1885 and 1986. These maps depict the area
prior to the construction of SH 71. No structures are visible along the route on the western side
of the river, while developed city blocks are present on the east side of the river around the turn
of the 20th century. SH 71 and the urbanization along its route first appear on the 1982
topographic quadrangle map.

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

The Project Area extends along the northern edge of the modern alignment of SH 71
frontage road. This area has experienced considerable impacts in the past from roadway
construction, bridge construction, and utility installation. With this in mind, it was Horizon’s
opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed a relatively low potential for any deeply buried
and intact cultural deposits that could be eligible for formal designation as SALs or for inclusion
in the NRHP within the Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew conducted the cultural resources
investigations within the Project Area on 25 October 2016. Because the Project Area consists
predominantly of an existing, heavily disturbed utility easement that is covered in large part by
concrete or asphalt, only a general reconnaissance assessment was conducted along the vast
majority of the Project Area in order to document the existing disturbances and lack of potential
for any intact cultural deposits. This general reconnaissance assessment entailed a visual
inspection of the project alignment coupled with photo-documentation of the disturbances.
The areas retaining the only potential for buried cultural deposits within the Project Area
were the HDD bore entry/exit locations on opposing sides of the Colorado River. As such, the
main focus of the field efforts was the assessment of these 2 HDD areas. The HDD bore entry
on the west bank of the Colorado River is situated on a cleared, lower terrace where deep
alluvial deposits are present (see Figures 1-1, 1-2, 2-5, and 2-6). To assess this location, the
field crew excavated 2 backhoe trenches in the immediate vicinity of the proposed HDD bore
entry box. A large stockpile of spoil utilized for nearby roadwork covered the majority of the
area at this location. Fortunately, a large portion of this stockpile had been cleared prior to the
field efforts, which allowed access to the immediate fringes of the proposed HDD bore entry box
(Figure 5-1). The excavated trenches measured approximately 4.0 m (13.1 feet) in length and
0.6 m (2.0 feet) wide (i.e., the bucket width). They were each initially excavated to a depth of
approximately 1.2 m (4.0 feet) in order to allow safe access for field personnel to document the
upper extent of the trench profiles. This included cleaning and analyzing the southern profile of
each trench, followed by the sketching and photographing of each profile. Subsequent to the
documentation of the upper profile, the trenches were then excavated to depths of 2.8 m
(9.2 feet) to prospect for cultural deposits within the deeper reaches of the location. The field
crew did not enter any trench after it was excavated deeper than 1.2 m (4.0 feet) in compliance
with standard safety regulations. During the trench excavation, all excavated spoil was
monitored for cultural materials, and samples of the excavated spoil were be screened through
6.0-millimeter (mm) (0.25-inch) hardware mesh.
The eastern HDD bore exit is located on an artificially cut slope on the edge of a private
residence’s lawn (see Figures 1-1, 1-2, 2-7, and 2-8). Because this location consists of (1) an
extreme slope that precluded the placement of a backhoe; (2) the edge of a manicured lawn;
and (3) a utility easement containing several existing utility lines that could be damaged by

mechanical excavation, the field crew primarily relied on the visual inspection of the cut slope of
the landform to prospect for cultural materials. They also excavated 1 shovel test at the base of
the slope at the HDD location to prospect for cultural materials (see Figure 5-1). All excavated
soil was screened through 6.0-mm (0.25-inch) hardware mesh or was trowel-sorted if dense
clay soils prohibit successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests, and
cultural materials observed (if any). Standardized shovel test and backhoe trench forms were
completed for every shovel test/backhoe trenches. These forms included location data, depth,
soil type, and notations on any artifacts encountered. If any new archeological sites were
recorded, standard site forms were to be completed and filed at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent housing. Similarly, if any previously recorded
archeological sites were assessed, updated site forms were to be completed and filed at TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility or
for return to the appropriate landowner. Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and
assessed in the field and placed back where they were found. Digital photographs with a photo
log were completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via
handheld global positioning system (GPS) units utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator
(UTM) coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Backhoe trench
and shovel test locations have been presented in Figure 5-1. Backhoe trench and shovel test
results are discussed in the following chapter.

6.0 RESULTS

As anticipated, Horizon’s cultural resources assessment of the Project Area found that it
extends along the northern edge of the SH 71 frontage road where prior highway and
infrastructure construction, utility installation, and various other forms of modern development
have left little to no potential for intact cultural deposits. Because of this, the field assessment
failed to find any location retaining the potential for intact cultural deposits within the portion of
the proposed ROW that would utilize open-cut trenches for construction. Additionally, backhoe
trenching and shovel testing efforts within the HDD bore entry/exit locations on opposing sides
of the Colorado River produced entirely negative results for subsurface cultural deposits. The
results of the backhoe trenching and shovel testing efforts are provided below.

6.1

BACKHOE TRENCHING

Two backhoe trenches (BHT-1 and BHT-2) were excavated in the immediate vicinity of
the proposed HDD bore entry on the west bank of the Colorado River where deep alluvial soils
are present (Figures 6-1 and 6-2; see also Figure 5-1). As previously noted, a large stockpile of
spoil utilized for nearby roadwork covered the majority of the area at this location.
Coincidentally, a large portion of this stockpile had been cleared prior to the field efforts, which
allowed access to the immediate fringes of the proposed HDD bore entry box (see Figure 5-1).
The excavated trenches measured approximately 4.0 m (13.1 feet) in length and 0.6 m
(2.0 feet) wide (i.e., the bucket width).
Both excavated trenches produced negative results for prehistoric or historic-era cultural
deposits. Because of their location on the upper extent of the terrace where modern bridge
construction has occurred, both trenches revealed modern fill deposits within roughly the upper
1.0 m (3.0 feet) of the trench profiles. These fill materials were overlying a relatively recent
buried surface that still retained intact vegetation on its upper edge. Below the fill materials,
homogenous sand and sandy loam continued down to the excavated base of the trenches at
roughly 2.8 m (9.2 feet) below surface. The main difference between the 2 trenches was a layer
of gravel and asphalt within BHT-2 at a depth of 1.2 to 1.3 m (3.9 to 4.3 feet) below surface,
suggesting that artificial fill is present even below the buried surface retaining the vegetation.
The southern trench profile of BHT-1 is described in Table 6-1, while a photograph is presented
in Figure 6-3. The southern trench profile for BHT-2 is described in Table 6-2, and the
photograph is presented in Figure 6-4.

SHOVEL TESTING

The eastern HDD bore exit is located on an artificially cut slope on the edge of a private
residence’s lawn (see Figures 2-7 and 2-8). Because this location consists of (1) an extreme
slope that precluded the placement of a backhoe; (2) the edge of a manicured lawn; and (3) a
utility easement containing several existing utility lines that could be damaged by mechanical
excavation, the field crew visually inspected of the cut slope of the landform for cultural
materials. They also excavated 1 shovel test at the base of the slope at the HDD location to
prospect for cultural materials (see Figure 5-1).
The visual inspection of the cut slope revealed no evidence of any buried cultural
materials at this location. Additionally, the excavated shovel test revealed dense clay loam soils
within the existing, heavily disturbed utility easement that contained only modern trash. The
shovel test profile is presented in Table 6-3.
In all, the backhoe trenching and shovel testing efforts produced negative results within
the HDD bore boxes on opposing sides of the Colorado River. Based on these negative results,
as well as the lack of potential for any intact cultural deposits along the length of the proposed
waterline ROW, it is Horizon’s opinion that the undertaking would pose no adverse effects to
any cultural resources that are eligible for formal designation as SALs or that are listed on or
considered eligible for listing on the NRHP.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

On 25 October 2016, Horizon conducted cultural resources investigations along a
proposed water line ROW located on the south side of Bastrop in Bastrop County, Texas. The
City of Bastrop is proposing the construction of approximately 1.1 miles (1.8 km) of new
waterline in order to provide an additional potable water feed to areas of Bastrop on the west
side of the Colorado River. The proposed waterline would be installed within existing utility
easements bordering the north side of the SH 71 frontage road. As the undertaking would be
located on public property, it would fall under the regulations of the ACT. In addition, the
proposed waterline would be installed via a HDD beneath the Colorado River. As the Colorado
River is a Section 10 waterway at this location, the HDD beneath the river channel would
require the utilization of a NWP issued by the USACE. As NWPs are federal permits, the
portion of the undertaking under the purview of the USACE would also fall under the regulations
of Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended. At the request of the City of Bastrop,
Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations within the Project Area in compliance
with the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the investigations was to determine
if any significant archeological deposits are located within the Project Area and, if any exist, to
determine if the project would have the potential to have any adverse effects on sites eligible for
formal designation as SALs or sites listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. The
cultural resources investigations were conducted under TAC permit no. 7818.
Because the Project Area consists predominantly of an existing, heavily disturbed utility
easement that is covered in large part by concrete or asphalt, only a general reconnaissance
assessment (visual inspection and photo-documentation) was conducted along the vast majority
of the Project Area in order to document the existing disturbances and lack of potential for any
intact cultural deposits. The areas retaining the only potential for buried cultural deposits are
the HDD bore entry/exit locations on opposing sides of the Colorado River. As such, the
cultural resources investigations focused on these 2 HDD areas. The HDD bore entry on the
west bank of the Colorado River is situated on a cleared, lower terrace where deep alluvial
deposits are present. To assess this location, the field crew excavated 2 backhoe trenches
within the proposed HDD bore entry box. The eastern HDD bore exit is located on an artificially
cut slope on the edge of a private residence’s lawn. Because this location consists of (1) an
extreme slope that precludes the placement of a backhoe; (2) the edge of a manicured lawn;

HJN 160165 AR

43

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

and (3) a utility easement containing several existing utility lines that could be damaged by
mechanical excavation, the field crew visually inspected the cut slope of the landform for cultural
materials and excavated 1 shovel test within the existing utility easement.
As the Project Area extends along the northern edge of the SH 71 frontage road, the
cultural resources investigations resulted in the observation that the vast majority of the Project
Area has been previously impacted by roadway and infrastructure construction, utility
installation, and various other forms of modern development. Because of this, the field
assessment failed to find any location retaining the potential for intact cultural deposits within
the portion proposed ROW that will utilize open-cut trenches for construction. Additionally,
backhoe trenching and shovel testing efforts within the HDD bore entry/exit locations on
opposing sides of the Colorado River also produced entirely negative results for subsurface
cultural deposits.

7.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the cultural resources investigations, it is Horizon’s opinion that
the construction of the proposed waterline will pose no adverse effects to significant cultural
resources that are eligible for formal designation as SALs or that are listed on or considered
eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that the undertaking be allowed
to proceed relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT, the USACE, and Section 106 of the NHPA.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance within the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location
of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
