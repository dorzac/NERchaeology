ABSTRACT

In early January of 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey of approximately 35 acres of the
proposed Fate City Park which is located in the uplands of north central
Rockwall County, Texas. The northern boundary is W. C. Boren Road, SH
66 the eastern boundary and an intermittent tributary to Parker Creek
forms the western and southern boundaries. Besides the normal park
facilities, two ponds, a dry and a wet one, will be constructed within the
park. The intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the Blackland
Prairie uplands was done for Planning Concepts which is doing the
environmental permitting for the City of Fate. No cultural materials were
exposed on the surface or in the clays that underlie this Blackland area as
discovered in 18 shovel tests.
Based upon the absence of archaeological sites, AR Consultants requests
that the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission concur
with our recommendation that construction of the proposed park proceed
without the need for further cultural resources investigation. If buried
deposits are encountered during construction, work should immediately
cease in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be notified.

INTRODUCTION

In early January of 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of the proposed Fate City Park which contains approximately 35
acres. The proposed semi-rectangular park tract is located approximately 3,088 feet north
of the center of the City of Fate and west of and adjacent to SH 66 and south of W. C.
Boren Road (Figure 1). Besides the normal park facilities, two ponds, a dry and a wet
one, will be constructed within the park. This survey was conducted for Planning
Concepts which is doing the environmental assessment for the City of Fate. The City is
receiving funding from the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife for construction of
the park.
The purpose of the investigation was to determine if cultural resources are present in the
proposed park site and to make recommendations about their archaeological significance
and how they might be impacted by development. In addition, the purpose of this survey
was to place the discovered cultural resources in a regional context. Antiquities permit
number 4735 was issued to AR Consultants, Inc. to do this survey since the City of Fate
is a political entity of the State of Texas and the Antiquities Code of Texas applies to this
investigation. Since the proposed park site is located within the 100 year floodplain of an
intermittent tributary to Parker Creek, possible relevant federal legislation may include
Section 404 Permit for the Clean Waters Act, the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93291), Executive Order Number 11593, “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural
Environment”, and Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties
(36CFR800), Appendix C.
This report has been written in accordance with the report guidelines prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (ND) and accepted by the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission. The following report presents a brief description of the
natural and cultural environment of the study area. This is followed by a description of
the research design and methodology. The results of the investigation follow and
constitute the body of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations that arise
from the study. A list of references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Rockwall County is located in the Blackland Prairie of North Central Texas. The county
has three distinct topographic divisions: the valley of the East Fork of the Trinity River, a
small area of gently undulating to steeply sloping terraces west of that valley and a
rolling upland east of the valley which make up 80 percent of the county and where the
study area is located. The rolling uplands are treeless today although there were extensive
timberlands along the East Fork of the Trinity River. Almost all of the county streams
drain into the East Fork except for the northeastern part of the county which flows into
the Sabine Creek (Hart 2004:1). The City of Fate is in northeastern Rockwall County on
the divide between the East Fork of the Trinity River and the Sabine River.
The bedrock geology of the study area consists of the Upper Cretaceous-aged Marlbrook
Marl (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988). The Marlbrook Marl is equivalent in age to
the Upper Taylor Marl and contains calcareous clays which weather light gray in color.
Soils derived from the weathering of the marl in the study area belong to the Houston
Black-Heiden Soil Association which consists of nearly level to strongly sloping upland
prairie clays (Pringle 1977:General Soils Map). Two soil are found within the study area,
the Heiden clay with 3 to 5 percent slopes and the Houston Black with 1 to 3 percent
slopes (Pringle 1977:Sheet 4).
As previously mentioned, the study area is located in the Blackland Prairie vegetative
area of Texas. Kuchler (1966) classifies the prairie as being dominated by AndropogonSipa grasses. Various other grasses also are present. The prairie environment is one of
low biotic diversity. The prairie savannah zone of the Texan biotic zone (Blair
1950:Figure 1) contains 47 species of mammals, 41 reptiles, and 35 amphibians.
Paleoenvironmental change is not well documented, but it is summarized by Prikryl
(1993:192-193). Prior to 12,000 B.C., the climate of North Central Texas was cooler and
moister than at present. Between 12,000 and 8,000 B.C., the climate became warmer and
this continued to the present, but with brief mesic periods. It is suggested that the
presence of high grass pollen and low arboreal pollen between 5550 and1050 B.C. show
a drying with a return of arboreal pollen after 1050 B.C. The later change is similar to
today’s environment. High grass pollen also occurs at approximately A.D. 450 and from
A.D. 1550 to 1650, and this also indicates drier periods. The presence of paleosols
between A.D. 1 and 1000 suggest an increase in moisture during this period with a return
to drier conditions after A.D. 1000.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Introduction
The prairie lands of North Central Texas have been occupied for many thousands of years
and the history of the prehistoric peoples who have left behind evidence of their
occupation is known to many of the residents who inhabit the area today. At the same
time, a thorough understanding of these people and their use of the land during this
lengthy occupation is lacking due to the vastness of the area, the ephemeral evidence of
some of this occupation, and the limited and scattered studies that have been carried out.
Virtually no major cultural resources studies have been conducted in the uplands of
Rockwall County and the following discussion draws on information presented by Smith
(1969), Peter and McGregor (1988), Prikryl (1990, 1993), and other sources. The
Prehistoric period has been divided into three major periods: Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and
Late Prehistoric. Times presented below are derived from radiocarbon dating of deposits
at sites elsewhere in the north central Texas.

4000 to 1500 B.C.
6000 to 4000 B.C.
10,000 to 6,000 B.C.

Culture History
The Paleo-Indian culture (10,000 to 6,000 B.C.) had been described as relying on an
economy of hunting and gathering, with primary emphasis being on the hunting and
processing of megafauna (mammoth and bison). The Lewisville site (Crook and Harris
1957) and the Aubrey site (Ferring 2001) and good examples of sites dated to this period.
Both campsites were deeply buried, and thus preserved, in the floodplain sediments of the
Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Surface artifacts dating to this period have been reported
from the Rockwall County area (Meltzer and Bever 1995:Table 2), but no Paleoindian
sites have been investigated. There is no evidence of Paleo-Indian occupation in the area
of the proposed project although projectile points such as Clovis, Folsom, Meserve,
Plainview, San Patrice, Scottsbluff, and Eden have been found on the surface of sites
throughout the region.
The Archaic culture period follows the Paleo-Indian and lasts from 6,000 B.C. to possibly
as late as A.D. 600. Hunting and gathering continued to be the means by which the
people supported their groups. This adaptation was more diversified than that of the
earlier period, and there is limited evidence that the population increased in size during

the course of this period of time. Archaic sites are more common, although there is little
evidence of Early Archaic occupation in the area. The Middle Archaic period has been
termed the La Harpe Aspect in East Texas (Johnson 1962:269), while the term Trinity
Aspect (Crook and Harris 1952) has been used in the Trinity River Basin. Prikryl (1990:
73) has questioned the value of the Trinity Aspect and prefers the use of the time period
terminology since there seem to be questions about the primary contexts of the
assemblages from the sites used to define the Aspect.
Based upon information derived from the Limerick Site (Duffield 1961:101), Late
Archaic peoples continued a hunting and gathering lifestyle. Apparently sites were
located at the intersection of creeks and the Sabine River.
A transition to the Late Prehistoric/Caddoan period is signaled by the presence of a crude
form of generally plain brown pottery known as Williams Plain that occurs at sites where
dart points dominate the assemblages. This pottery type was found at the Gossett
Bottoms, Lacy, and Wild Bull sites at Cedar Creek Lake (Story 1965). However, no
Willams Plain sherds were discovered at the Limerick site (Duffield 1961). Very little is
known about this transition period.
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric is signaled by the appearance of ceramics and
arrow points in the first millennium A.D. The Late Prehistoric I period (ca. A.D. 6001200) is also signaled by the appearance of houses and corn horticulture. Locally made
pottery appears to be copies of Caddoan Alto and Sanders phase types. Evidence for corn
horticulture was noted at the Cobb-Pool site at Lake Joe Pool (Peter and McGregor
1988). Late Prehistoric II dates from A.D. 1200-1600 and is characterized by the
appearance of a Plains Village-like artifact assemblage. Harahey knives, thumbnail
scrapers, and flake drills are frequently found with triangular-shaped and Perdiz
arrowpoints. In some cases, these artifacts have been found with bison kills and in other
cases bison scapulas had been used to make hoe blades. Nocona Plain, a shell-tempered
pottery, occurs during this prehistoric period and is believed to be locally made.
The Protohistoric period of North Central Texas begins with the appearance of the
Spanish about A.D. 1541. At about this same time, immigrant Native American groups
moved into the same area and either displaced the prehistoric inhabitants or moved into
areas that had previously been abandoned. The beginning of this period was marked by
the limited and sporadic contact between European explorers and the native residents.
The introduction and adoption of the horse, and ultimately firearms.
A wide variety of historic Indian groups inhabited this part of Texas. There are very few
sites attributed to historic Indians in this region (Skinner 1988), but sites are known in
surrounding areas where historic Wichita sites are reported from near Waco, Mexia,
Emory, and Spanish Fort.
The historic period (Fox 1983) overlaps with the Protohistoric but is best known in the
area for the period from the Civil War to the present. During this period, the indigenous
population was eliminated and removed from the area. The invading Europeans focused

on farming and ranching. The Anglo-American history of the Upper Trinity River Basin
has been divided into the Frontier, Initial Cash Crop, Tenant Farming, and Agribusiness
periods by Richner and Lee (1976:125-133). The Frontier period lasted from about 1820
to 1850 and was followed by the Initial Cash Crop period that lasted until 1870. Tenant
Farming began at 1870 and continued to about 1940. Agribusiness began after the Great
Depression and continues to this date.
The City’s name “Fate” derives from the nickname that Lafayette Brown’s wife called
him. He was one of the early settlers in the area. By the late-1880s, Fate was a thriving
community when the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad built a line through the area.
Interestingly, Fate was not the name of the community that the railroad went through, but
it was called Barnes City. However, in order not to seek a new post office, the residents
changed the name to Fate. Fate’s first bank was opened in 1907 and the first highway
reached the town after World War I. Fate’s economy has always been focused on
agriculture, but with the advent of better roads and automobiles, most of the trade went to
larger cities like Dallas. The community’s businesses and population moved to Dallas
which caused Fate’s economy and population to decline. This trend began to turn around
in the early 1970s and this trend continues today (Hart 2008:1).
Previous Investigations
The major archaeological survey in Rockwall County was conducted at Lake Ray
Hubbard [formerly Forney Reservoir] by the Dallas Archeological Society (Harris and
Suhm 1963). Thirty-three archaeological sites were recorded. This survey described 20
sites already known to the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS) membership (Hannah
1941; Hannah and Harris 1948; Harris 1948, 1960), and located 13 previously unrecorded
sites. Only limited excavations were subsequently conducted at the Lower Rockwall site
(Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968) and the Upper Rockwall site (Ross 1966), but along with
the previous DAS excavations, they did provide evidence of the way of life practiced by
the prehistoric peoples who occupied this part of the East Fork valley.
AR Consultants (Skinner 1999) conducted an archaeological survey of three park sites
which totaled approximately 30 acres for the City of Heath. No cultural materials older
than 50 years were seen on the ground surface or uncovered in 3 shovel tests. AR
Consultants, Inc. (Todd 2004) surveyed approximately 15,000 feet of sewer pipeline
route adjacent to Sabine Creek for Royse City but failed to discover any archaeological
sites on the ground surface or in 48 shovel tests.
Two major pipeline routes have been placed in Rockwall County. The East Fork Water
Reuse pipeline runs from south to north across Rockwall County and is west of the study
area (Todd and Skinner 2005). The Lake Tawakoni Water Supply pipeline terminates in
southeastern Rockwall County (Todd 2006).

No residences within the study area are plotted on the 1923 Soils Map for Rockwall
County (Bureau of Soils 1923) or on the General Highway Map for Dallas and Rockwall
Counties (Texas State Highway Department 1936). Also, no archaeological sites are
listed within or adjacent to the study area on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2008).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The Research Design was created so that the information derived from the archaeological
survey of the proposed park site might provide significant information of the prehistory
and history of not only Rockwall County but the State of Texas.
Based on previous surveys in the Blackland, it was anticipated that no prehistoric sites
would be encountered due to the absence of perennial water and low biotic diversity.
Historic sites might be encountered because the proposed park site is close to a
transportation route.
Methodology
In order to implement the above research design, the survey area was systematically
investigated by walking north-south oriented transects spaced 30 meters apart. Although
the study area is in an upland setting, one shovel test per two acres was excavated as
recommended by the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002). Due to the degrading
environment from farming and erosion over the last 100 years, shovel tests were
excavated to approximately 30 centimeters below the ground surface. The clay matrices
were not screened but were broken manually and visually inspected for cultural materials
as were the pit walls. Notes on the soils, vegetation, topography and other relevant
information were made and photographs were taken.
Deep testing was not done due to the upland setting and lack of a floodplain where in situ
cultural materials might have been buried.

RESULTS
The results section is divided into three parts. In the first part, the survey area is described
and the survey is discussed in the second part. The general information derived from the
shovel tests is used in the survey discussion. For individual shovel test information,
please see Table 1. Shovel test locations are shown on Figure 7. Conclusions derived
from the survey end the chapter.
The survey area
The proposed park site’s terrain slopes gently to the south. Trees consist of eastern red
cedar, hackberry, bois d’arc, honey locust and elm. Understory vegetation includes saw
greenbriar, hog brush, rabbit grass, bermuda grass, broomweed and other grass and bush
species. Ground visibility ranged from less than 10 percent in the undisturbed
unimproved pasture (Figure 2) to 90 percent along the channelized portion of the firstorder tributary to Parker Creek (Figure 3). Eye-height visibility ranged from good to
excellent. The tributary is approximately 4 meters wide and 2 meters deep. The substrate
consists of clay that contains limestone gravel and cobbles. Water was flowing from the
previous night’s rain and was less than 0.25 m deep (Figure 4). No buried cultural
deposits were seen in the sloping bank walls and no knappable lithic materials were seen
in the drainage’s channel.

Disturbances were abundant in the study area. Three two-track dirt roads are present
within the study area which allowed for excellent ground visibility. A channelized
drainage (Figure 5) bisects the study area and runs from north to south to the tributary of
Parker Creek. The drainage cut is approximately 15 m wide and 3 m deep. At least 17 m
of land has been cleared on both sides of the channelized drainage. A corridor adjacent to
the north bank of the tributary has been cleared (Figure 6) and ground visibility was at
least 85 percent. Fire hydrants and sewer mains are present south of and adjacent to W.
C. Boren Road.

the tributary of Parker Creek. View is to the south.

The survey
As previously stated, north-south transects were walked and 18 shovel tests were
excavated (Figure 7). Shovel tests were excavated in undisturbed areas where the ground
visibility was less than 40 percent. All of the shovel tests uncovered culturally sterile
black clay from the surface to 38 cm which was the deepest shovel test. No cultural
materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface.

Conclusions
As expected, no prehistoric sites were discovered within the park site. Previous surveys
were confirmed by this finding and we attribute this to the absence of perennial water and
low biotic diversity in the Blackland Prairie. No historic sites were found and this may be
that the historic inhabitants of the area preferred to farm the land instead of living upon it.
As previously mentioned, no residences were shown on maps of the study area from 1923
to 1963.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based upon the lack of cultural materials within the 35 acre Fate City Park Site or in 18
shovel tests, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource
investigations are unwarranted.
If, however, cultural materials are discovered during construction of the park facilities
and two ponds, work should stop in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission should be notified.
