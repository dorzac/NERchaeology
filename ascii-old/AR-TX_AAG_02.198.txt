ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of approximately 4.28 miles (25.94 acres) of Brazos
River Authority (BRA) Replacement Pipeline Segments associated with the City of
Abilene’s Possum Kingdom Raw Water Roughing Facility, located east and northeast of
Breckenridge, Stephens County Texas was conducted by American Archaeology Group
LLC in December 2014. The project was conducted under the auspices of Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 7095 and section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(potential Corps of Engineers permitting). The proposed depth of impacts are 10 feet below
the ground surface, and the existing right-of-way is 50 feet. AAG focused its efforts on the
existing right-of-way but also conducted a pedestrian survey of an additional 30 feet of
ground surface on the north/west sides of the right-of-way in an effort to identify any
noticeable cultural resources that might be affected by light vehicular traffic during access
for the project, although construction and traffic are limited to the right-of-way.
Approximately 60% of the ground surface of the project area had been disturbed by prior
earth moving activities. Other surface disturbances included pipeline construction, rightof-way maintenance, erosion, livestock, two-track road, oilfield pipelines and stock tank
construction.
Three archaeological sites were identified during the course of this survey. Site
41SE331 was recorded as a small prehistoric lithic scatter (10 x 10 meters) on a slope on
the west side of Bee Branch. The site was located within the existing pipeline right-of-way
which has been severely impacted by prior pipeline construction, erosion, and right-of-way
maintenance. This site is located on the south side of an unnamed tributary to Bee Branch
and the topography elevation is 1,112 feet (amsl). Subsurface tests confirmed that no
subsurface cultural deposits were present. The site was identified on the basis of five
tertiary flakes located on the surface. These flakes represent what is remaining of this site
or they may have eroded down into the pipeline corridor from a higher elevation. No intact
features or subsurface cultural deposits were encountered, therefore, this portion of the site
within the pipeline right-of-way is not considered eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nor worthy of designation as a State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL). Any future investigations or proposed impacts in the vicinity of this site
outside of the right-of-way, should examine the area for any extensions of this site.
Site 41SE332 was recorded as a small pole barn with a tin roof that has collapsed
and was located just outside of the existing pipeline corridor. The site appears to be an
early-mid 20th century ranching feature. Since the site is located outside of the right-ofway, AAG did not assess significance since no work was authorized outside of the rightof-way. Any future proposed impacts in the vicinity of the site should address this site and
determine if any subsurface cultural deposits are present.
Site 41SE333 was recorded as a burned rock scatter with lithic debitage. The site
was located during access to the second pipeline segment. The burned rock and several
tertiary flakes were observed on the surface on the south side of the two-track ranch road.
The majority of the site is located outside of existing Brazos River Authority pipeline rightof-way, and only a few burned rock fragments and two flakes were observed within the
ii

project right-of-way. The entire area has been subjected to prior pipeline construction,
right-of-way maintenance, ranch road construction, erosion and livestock grazing. The site
appears to be approximately 40 meters x 15 meters just outside the pipeline right-of-way
except for a few burned rocks appearing within the corridor but was probably larger prior
to the noted impacts. This site is located approximately 1,308 feet northeast of Little Cedar
Creek along a toe slope. The topographic elevation of this site is 1,140 feet (amsl).
Subsurface tests were excavated on the north side of the ranch road inside the rightof-way, and no subsurface cultural deposits were identified. No features, important artifact
assemblages, features, or any subsurface cultural deposits were identified; therefore, this
portion of the site is not considered eligible for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) nor worthy of designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).
If future proposed impacts will take place south of the ranch road, and expand the right-ofway, these surficial deposits are recommended to be tested to determine if any intact
subsurface cultural deposits exist or if any other relevant information can be recovered with
regards to the age of this site and any other information that will contribute to the prehistory
of the region.
American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) recommends that construction within
the project area be allowed to proceed as planned. Monitoring during construction by a
professional archaeologist is not considered necessary. No artifacts were collected,
therefore, no artifacts were curated and project records are curated at AAG.

INTRODUCTION
American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) is assisting the City of Abilene with the
permitting process required to proceed with construction of four (4) replacement sections of
existing pipeline to distribute raw water from the Possum Kingdom (PK) Lake to the proposed
new Raw Water Roughing Facility (RWRF), located east and northeast of Breckenridge,
Stephens County, Texas (Figure 1). Due to ongoing drought conditions an additional source
of raw water for the City of Abilene is needed. The planned project will consist of
improvements to implement Possum Kingdom Lake as a raw water supply under the City of
Abilene’s Second Stage Short-term Drought Strategy. This portion of the project is called the
Brazos River Authority (BRA) Replacement Pipeline Segments. In December 2014, AAG
conducted an archaeological survey and testing in the project area, which covered
approximately 4.28 miles (25.94 acres) of pipeline replacement in four sections, north of
Highway 180 (Figures 2a, 2b). This report describes the implementation and results of the
investigation. Funding for the project was provided by the City of Abilene.
The investigation was designed to detect prehistoric and/or historic cultural
resources that could potentially be impacted by the proposed waterline replacements.
Fieldwork was authorized by the Texas Historical Commission (Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 7095) and comprised systematic surface survey at 5 meter intervals and subsurface
testing was completed through backhoe trenching and shovel testing. At the time fieldwork
was undertaken, approximately 60% of the project area had been subjected to various
impacts in the past including pipeline construction, right-of-way maintenance, erosion,
livestock, two-track road, oilfield pipelines and stock tank construction. The proposed
depth of impacts are 10 feet below the ground surface, and the existing right-of-way is 50
feet. AAG focused its efforts on the existing right-of-way but also conducted a pedestrian
survey of an additional 30 feet of ground surface on the north/west sides of the right-ofway in an effort to identify any noticeable cultural resources that might be affected by light
vehicular traffic during access for the project, although construction and traffic are limited
to the right-of-way.
The project area is depicted on the 7.5’ U.S.G.S. topographic quadrangles Grand
Lake and Ivan South (Figures 2a,2b). The U.T.M. coordinates for the approximate center
of the tract are Zone 14 Northing 3628497 and Easting 524683. Appendix I contains the
Research Design and Scope of Work. This project involves plans to replace existing
pipeline segments with new reinforced pipe to handle increased pressure in four segments
of pipeline. The first segment is the northern-most and it is 1,988 feet (.37 miles) in length
and the topographic range in elevation is 1,130 to 1,150 feet above mean sea level (amsl).
The second segment is 4,500 feet (.85 miles) in length and the topographic range in
elevation is 1,095 to 1,125 feet (amsl). The third segment is 12,353 feet (2.34 miles) in
length and the topographic range in elevation is 1,130 to 1,210 feet (amsl). The fourth
segment is 3,800 feet (.72 miles) in length and the topographic elevation is approximately
1,185 feet.

1

The nearest water sources are Mulberry Creek (first segment-northern-most), Bee
Branch (second segment), the third segment flows near Little Cedar Creek and Cedar
Creek, and the fourth (southern-most) segment is near Cedar Creek. The topographic
elevation range of the project area is 1,095 to 1,185 feet in elevation (amsl).
Previous archaeological surveys in Stephens County have identified significant
prehistoric and historic sites. Enprotec/Hibbs & Todd Inc. contracted with American
Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G.) on behalf of the City of Abilene to perform an
archaeological survey under the auspices of the Texas Antiquities Code pursuant to
Antiquities Permit Number 7095, and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act.

ENVIROMENTAL SETTING
Natural Setting
This section was previously prepared by AAG (Griggs et al. 2007:4). The project
area is located in the Cross Timbers and Prairies ecological region of Texas (Gould 1975).
This region covers 67,340 square kilometers (26,000 square miles) in the north central
portion of the state (Figure 3). Potential vegetation is alternating bands of wooded habitat
scattered throughout prairie dominated by one-three foot tall grasses (TPWD 2007a).
Historic anthropogenic disturbances have significantly altered native plant communities.
Common trees present today, particularly in the vicinity of Stephens County, include
pecan, mesquite, hackberry and elm. Grasses include broom weed, wild rye and milkweed.
The topography is broken with hilly plateaus. Average annual rainfall levels in the Cross
Timbers region grade higher from east to west. In Stephens County the average annual
rainfall is 67.1 centimeters (26.4 inches). Average temperatures range from a low of 31°
F in January to a high of 98° F in July (Leffler 2007).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Cultural Sequence
This section was previously prepared by AAG (Griggs et al. 2007:8-11). The land
that is now Texas has been occupied by human populations for more than 11,000 years. A
chronological framework developed by archaeologists for the interpretation of Texas
history comprises five general temporal periods whose boundaries correspond to
significant cultural and social developments (Nunley 1989:37-46). These periods and their
approximate dates are as follows: 1) Paleoindian (11,500- 8500 before present [hereafter
B.P.]); 2) Archaic (8500-1200 B.P.); 3) Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800-1450); 4) Protohistoric
(A.D. 1450-1650); and 5) Historic (A.D. 1650-1940s).
The Paleoindian period begins during the last Glacial and continues into the early
Holocene. The earliest confirmed Paleoindian populations in Texas were small, highly
mobile bands of hunters armed with distinctive fluted “Clovis” projectile points who
pursued large, late Pleistocene mammals, most notably mammoths (Surovell 2000; Turner
and Hester 1985; Waguespack and Surovell 2003). Later Paleoindian populations
developed new forms of projectile points and refined their hunting strategies in response
to environmental factors such as the extinction of the mammoth and other megamammals;
yet despite these adaptations, they maintained life ways more like those of their
predecessors than those of later Archaic populations.
The complete demise of the Pleistocene big-game animals and climate change
accompanying the onset of the Holocene are linked to shifts in stone tool technology,
subsistence pursuits and settlement patterns that define the Archaic period. The
Paleoindian-Archaic transition, like those between succeeding periods, occurred gradually.
As the Pleistocene megamammals began to vanish, indigenous populations focused on
smaller game and increased their reliance on local plant foods. With changes in subsistence
came new and more diverse stone toolkits and an increase in tools made of wood and other
organic materials. Additionally, settlements became more stable, and there is evidence for
progressively sophisticated cultural practices, such as systematic burial of the dead
(Bousman et al. 2002). Although the Archaic hunting and gathering lifeway remained
relatively stable for thousands of years, archaeologists are able to define four sub periods
(or eras) – Early, Middle, Late and Transitional – based on a dated sequence of diagnostic
projectile points (Turner and Hester 1985:47-49).
The Late Prehistoric period is marked in some areas of Texas, including the north
central region, by the introduction of domesticated plant foods such as corn and beans.
Technological innovations such as pottery and the bow and arrow were widely adopted
(Nunley 1989:44; Turner and Hester 1985:82).
The Protohistoric period is associated with an incipient European presence in the
region. Protohistoric indigenous populations were the first described in early ethnohistoric
accounts. Often, these accounts reflected only indirect contact. Items of European

8

manufacture are occasionally found in Protohistoric sites, though in most cases these items
were not acquired directly but through so called down-the-line trading (Nunley 1989:45).
The Historic period is characterized by a firm historical record and increasing direct
contact between indigenous and European explorers and settlers. Horses introduced by the
Spanish and European material culture led to profound changes in indigenous cultures.
Eventually, Old World diseases, resettlement and warfare claimed up to 95% of Texas
Indians (Klos 2007). The latter part of the Historic period encompasses the AngloEuropean settlement of Texas.
Local Archaeological and Historical Context
In Stephens County 320 archaeological sites are registered with Texas Historical
Commission. The vast majority of these are located in the north central and northeastern
part of the county along the Clear Fork of the Brazos River and on Hubbard Creek
downstream from the Hubbard Creek Reservoir (RCRI 2014). The distribution of these
sites reflects both a predilection on the part of prehistoric populations for riparian
settlements, which provided access to fresh water and game animals, and a recent surge in
archaeological surveys along river ways targeted for reservoir projects.
Sites dating to all periods of the cultural chronology outlined in the section above,
with the exception of the Protohistoric, are represented in site records for Stephens County
(RCRI 2014). It is possible that some of the registered Late Prehistoric sites were occupied
in the Protohistoric period, but this is difficult to demonstrate since most material remains
from the Protohistoric are indistinguishable from those of the Late Prehistoric. Paleoindian
sites are truly rare in the county; only one has been registered (site 41SE78). Most
prehistoric sites have been assigned to the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods on the basis
of temporally diagnostic artifacts, primarily arrow points. Two sites from these periods
(41SE2 and 41SE3) contain rock art, which is uncommon in north central Texas (Figure 4;
Jackson 1938: 292-295). Around 15% of sites in the county contain historic components
that range from simple surface scatters of historic debris, such as glass and metal, to oilfield
camps and buildings. The County Courthouse, located in Breckenridge, has been
designated as a State Archaeological Landmark (RCRI 2014).

1938:plates CCXIV, CCXV).
The best documented period of prehistory in north central Texas is the Late
Prehistoric. During this period a large block of north central Texas, including much of
Stephens County, was occupied by interrelated populations whose shared cultural traits,
(e.g., artifact types and adaptive strategies) are referred to by archaeologists as the
Henrietta Focus. The Harrell site, located only a few miles north of Stephens County at
the confluence of the Brazos River and Clear Fork, is the “type site,” or ideal example, of
the Henrietta Focus (Krieger 1946:137). Current estimates place the chronological range
of the focus between A.D. 1200-1600 (Lynott 2007). Inhabitants of the Harrell site and
other Henrietta Focus sites were maize agriculturalists and hunters. Bison was the
preferred game, but deer, antelope and other small mammals, as well as turtles, turkey,
ducks and fish also contributed to the subsistence base. The material culture of the
Henrietta Focus is uniquely represented by a shell tempered pottery, Nocona Plain. Other
artifacts associated with the focus, though not exclusive to it, are small, triangular Harrell
and Washita arrow points (Figure 5), diamond-shaped and leaf-shaped bifaces, manos,
metates, bison scapula hoes, deer ulna flakers and disc beads made of perforated mussel or
Olivella shell (Krieger 1946:137-141; Lynott 2007). These artifacts, as well as a farming
and hunting subsistence base, link the Henrietta Focus to a broader cultural tradition, the
Plains Villager Horizon, which extends across the river valleys of the Southern Plains.
Trade relations with groups to the west are indicated at Henrietta Focus sites by the

10

occurrence of stone tools made of agatized dolomite from the Alibates Flint Quarry in the
Texas Panhandle and Puebloan pottery from the New Mexico area (Krieger 1946:111-112,
119).

During the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, north central Texas witnessed
the arrival of the Comanche, Kiowa and Tonkawa Indians. These groups are believed to
have migrated from the Great Basin and High Plains regions after acquiring Spanish horses.
All three were nomadic and depended on the buffalo for their subsistence (Mayhall 2007;
Lipscomb 2007; Carlisle 2007).
In the late 1850s, Anglo settlers began moving into north central Texas, and in 1858
the Texas legislature established what is now known as Stephens County (the original name
of Buchanan County was changed to Stephens in 1861 in honor of the vice president of the
Confederate States of America). Though early settlers were constantly harassed by raiding
parties of Comanche and Kiowa Indians until the early 1870s, the population of the county
grew steadily, reaching 4,725 by 1880 (Leffler 2007).
The first waves of Anglo settlers in Stephens County were primarily cattle ranchers.
By the late nineteenth century, however, cotton and corn farming provided a significant
contribution to the local economy. Cotton production fell precipitously following a boll
weevil infestation in the first decade of the twentieth century, but that bad fortune was
eventually eclipsed by an oil boom that began in 1916 with a strike at a well near Caddo.
Additional fields were soon discovered, and by 1922 Stephens County accounted for 15
percent of all the oil produced in the United States. The boom lured thousands of new
residents to the county, as well as eighty-nine oil companies and two railroads. Although
production slowed by the mid-1920s, oil remains a significant industry in the county. Other
key industries in Stephens County today are recreation, livestock agriculture and
manufacturing. Manufactured products include mobile homes, furniture, aircraft parts,
petrochemical and oilfield equipment (Leffler 2007; Hunt 2007).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Shelton (2009) conducted an archaeological survey for the Stephens Regional
Special Utility District (RSUD) Waterline Improvements immediately west of the current
project area next to Gunsolus (Gonzales) Creek. One prehistoric lithic procurement site
was recorded (41SE307). The site was determined to be ineligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places.
Griggs et al. (2007) surveyed approximately 2.98 acres for proposed improvements
at the Anniversary Park, located on the west side of Lake Hubbard Creek in Stephens
County, Texas in March 2007. The planned project consisted of improvements at a boat
ramp location within Anniversary Park, south of Highway 180. Approximately 90% of the
project area has been subjected to various impacts in the past including cutting and filling,
parking lot construction, and boat ramp construction. No archaeological sites were
encountered

12

PROJECT METHODOLOGY
The project was divided into three phases – archival research, field survey, and
report preparation. The archival research consisted of a check for records of registered
sites in the online “Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,” which is maintained by the Texas
Historical Commission, as well as a review of other literature for publications concerning
previous work in the county.
The field investigation was conducted in December 2014. The field investigation
involved a pedestrian surface survey supported with backhoe trenching and shovel testing
(Figures 2a, 2b; Appendix II-III). The survey was conducted systematically along the
entire 4.28 miles of pipeline replacement in four segment areas, with members of the
survey team inspecting the ground surface along linear transects spaced at 5 meter
intervals. Approximately 60% of the ground surface of the project area had been disturbed
by prior earth moving activities. Other surface disturbances included pipeline construction,
right-of-way maintenance, erosion, livestock, two-track road, oilfield pipelines and stock
tank construction. The proposed depth of impacts are 10 feet below the ground surface,
and the existing right-of-way is 50 feet. AAG focused its efforts on the existing right-ofway but also conducted a pedestrian survey of an additional 30 feet of ground surface on
the north/west sides of the right-of-way in an effort to identify any noticeable cultural
resources that might be affected by light vehicular traffic during access for the project,
although construction and traffic are limited to the right-of-way.
Visibility of some portions of the ground surface was obscured by patches of short
grasses, but otherwise, there was good visibility of greater than 60% due to erosion, or two
track road exposures. There were 5 backhoe trenches (BHTs) excavated to test for
subsurface deposits of cultural remains and they ranged from the shallowest at 100
centimeters to the deepest at 155 centimeters in depth with the average test depth of 132
centimeters (Appendix II). Additionally, 61 shovel tests were placed along the project
alignment to provide additional near surface testing (Appendix III). They ranged from the
shallowest at 5 centimeters to the deepest at 50 centimeters and the average depth was
24.80 centimeters. Samples of soil from each BHT were screened through ¼” hardware
cloth.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
A review of the archaeological literature for Stephens County revealed no
previously recorded sites within the project area. There were three sites worth referencing
which include 41SE5, 41SE301 and 41SE32. The first is an exposed bedrock mortar
(prehistoric) with five “eye-shaped” mortar holes. This site is located on a peninsula
extending into Hubbard Creek Reservoir northwest of the project area. Site 41SE301 lies
to the west of the project area, just north of Hwy 180. It is the ruin of an historic homestead.
Several sherds of glass and historic earthenware were recovered during a surface collection
at the site, and a cistern was documented. Site 41SE32, located west of 41SE301, is
described as a prehistoric campsite with a Late Prehistoric component. Several chipped
stone tools and a Scallorn arrow point were recovered during a surface survey. No
additional field research was recommended at any of the three sites by the archaeologists
who documented them.
Field Survey
The field investigation conducted for this project covered approximately 4.28 miles
of pipeline replacement in four sections, north of Highway 180 (Figures 2a, 2b) along the
existing Brazos River Authority Pipeline near Breckenridge, Stephens County. Roughly
60% of the project area had been heavily disturbed by prior earth moving activities, and
erosion, thus exposing a lot of bedrock and caliche deposits at or near the surface in many
areas (Figures 6 and 7). Three archaeological sites were identified during the survey:

Figure 7. Northern view of second segment. Note the stony soils and erosion.

Figure 8. View of site 41SE331 in the existing pipeline right-of-way.

Site 41SE331 (Appendix IV) was recorded as a small prehistoric lithic scatter (10
x 10 meters) on a slope on the west side of Bee Branch (Figure 8). The site was located
within the existing pipeline right-of-way which has been severely impacted by prior
pipeline construction, erosion, and right-of-way maintenance. This site is located on the
south side of an unnamed tributary to Bee Branch and the topography elevation is 1,112
feet (amsl). Subsurface tests confirmed that no subsurface cultural deposits were present.
The site was identified on the basis of five tertiary flakes located on the surface. These
flakes represent what is remaining of this site or they may have eroded down into the
pipeline corridor from a higher elevation. No intact features or subsurface cultural deposits
were encountered, therefore, this portion of the site within the pipeline right-of-way is not
considered eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nor
worthy of designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). Any future investigations
or proposed impacts in the vicinity of this site outside of the right-of-way, should examine
the area for any extensions of this site.
Site 41SE332 (Appendix IV) was recorded as a small pole barn with a tin roof that
has collapsed and was located just outside of the existing pipeline corridor (Figure 9). The
site appears to be an early-mid 20th century ranching feature. Since the site is located
outside of the right-of-way, AAG did not assess significance since no work was authorized
outside of the right-of-way. Any future proposed impacts in the vicinity of the site should
address this site and determine if any subsurface cultural deposits are present.
Site 41SE333 (Appendix IV) was recorded as a burned rock scatter with lithic
debitage (Figure 10). The site was located during access to the second pipeline segment.
The burned rock and several tertiary flakes were observed on the surface on the south side
of the two-track ranch road. The majority of the site is located outside of existing Brazos
River Authority pipeline right-of-way, and only a few burned rock fragments and two
flakes were observed within the project right-of-way. The entire area has been subjected to
prior pipeline construction, right-of-way maintenance, ranch road construction, erosion and
livestock grazing. The site appears to be approximately 40 meters x 15 meters just outside
the pipeline right-of-way except for a few burned rocks appearing within the corridor but
was probably larger prior to the noted impacts. This site is located approximately 1,308
feet northeast of Little Cedar Creek along a toe slope. The topographic elevation of this
site is 1,140 feet (amsl).
Subsurface tests were excavated on the north side of the ranch road inside the rightof-way, and no subsurface cultural deposits were identified. No features, important artifact
assemblages, features, or any subsurface cultural deposits were identified; therefore, this
portion of the site is not considered eligible for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) nor worthy of designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).
If future proposed impacts will take place south of the ranch road, and expand the right-ofway, these surficial deposits are recommended to be tested to determine if any intact
subsurface cultural deposits exist or if any other relevant information can be recovered with
regards to the age of this site and any other information that will contribute to the prehistory
of the region.

RECOMMENDATIONS
American Archaeology Group LLC recommends that construction within the
project area be allowed to proceed as planned. No artifacts were collected, therefore, no
curation was necessary. Monitoring during construction by a professional archaeologist is
not considered necessary. However, should any cultural materials be exposed in any area
not discussed in this report, all work in the immediate area must cease until the situation
can be evaluated by American Archaeology Group LLC in consultation with the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission and Enprotec/Hibbs & Todd, Inc.

APPENDIX I: RESEARCH DESIGN AND SCOPE OF WORK
Records Check
Prior to entering the field, American Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G.) will contact
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, the state
repository for site records on Texas, to determine if previously recorded sites are present
in the project area. This task may be conducted by a personal visit to TARL or by telephone.
The library at A.A.G. is very extensive, especially regarding reports for the project
area region, and much of the archival work can be accomplished in-house. Since A.A.G.
has conducted work in the area, much of the background work has already been
accomplished.
Permit Application
No fieldwork will commence until a permit from the Archeology Division (AD) of
the Texas Historical Commission has been issued. An application for an antiquities permit
will be submitted to AD-THC as soon as A.A.G. receives Notice To Proceed. Normally,
A.A.G. discusses the project with AD personnel before beginning any fieldwork. This is
done to ensure that both parties are in agreement as to the level of work required for this
project.
Survey Methods
The entire project area will be 100% intensively surveyed utilizing the pedestrian
survey method supported by shovel testing and/or augering and examination of eroded and
disturbed areas where cultural materials may be visible on the surface. Herbert G. Uecker
will act as the Principal Investigator. Shovel testing, augering, and backhoe trenching will
meet and exceed the Minimum Survey Standards For Texas established by the THC.
In areas of poor visibility, and environmental settings that have potential for buried
cultural materials, shovel testing will be required and tests will be concentrated in areas of
high site probability and randomly across the project area. All excavated fill from shovel
tests will be screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests will be manually
excavated to sterile clay or bedrock when possible.
The survey crew will be equipped with shovel test forms, notebooks, camera,
compass, and a project area map for accurate plotting of shovel tests, backhoe trenches,
and archaeological sites. In addition to shovel testing as a means of identifying buried sites,
select areas in alluvial settings or areas with some appreciable soil depth will be subjected
to backhoe trenching. All sites identified in the project area will be mapped in the field and
plotted on a topographic map. Site locations will also be determined through the use of a
Global Positioning System (GPS). Each site will be recorded using the official State of

22

Texas Archeological Site Form. In no case will the survey crew work outside of the project
area as depicted on the project area map provided by the client.
Only diagnostic artifacts will be collected from the surface. All artifacts recovered
through shovel testing will be collected. These specimens will be bagged and recorded on
a field sack log. They will be analyzed and prepared for eventual curation at TARL, unless
a petition to discard is prepared and accepted.
The draft report will be submitted to AD-THC for review. Once the report has been
approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), copies will be delivered to
AD-THC and the client. A.A.G. will maintain copies of the notes, photographs, site forms,
and any other records produced from the project deemed to be a work product.
