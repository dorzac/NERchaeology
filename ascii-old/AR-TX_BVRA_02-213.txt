ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a proposed 66 acre tract in central Brown
County, Texas was performed on March 3-4, 2009 by Brazos Valley Research
Associates (BVRA) for the City of Brownwood under Antiquities Permit 5180.
The area was found to be very disturbed through channelization of the creek and
agricultural practices such as terracing. The predominant soil in the project area
is firm clay with some gravel. The area was investigated through a pedestrian
survey and shovel testing. Shovel tests were shallow due to clay at the surface.
Although a previously recorded prehistoric site (41BR89) was recorded just to the
north of the project area, no evidence of prehistoric activity was found in the
current project area. One historic site (41BR559) was recorded. This site
consists of cement foundations and roads associated with Camp Bowie, a World
War II training facility. The foundations were for warehouses, a fuel depot, and
buildings associated with the military motor pool. This site is not eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State
Archeological Landmark. Therefore, protection is not recommended. No artifacts
were collected. Copies of the final report are on file at the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), City of
Brownwood, and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Brownwood plans to construct a municipal park on a 66 acre
tract in the city limits of Brownwood, Texas (Figure 1). The project area is
bounded on the north by Milam Drive and Camp Bowie City Park, on the south
by Farm-to-Market Road 45, on the east by Dickman Drive, and on the west by
Farm-to-Market Road 2376, also know as Albert Sidney Johnson Drive. The
purpose of this project is to provide recreation to the citizens of Brownwood. This
project is being funded by the City of Brownwood. At the time of this survey, the
Brownwood Industrial Foundation owned the project area. Ownership will be
transferred to the City at a later date. Planned improvements include baseball
fields, a nature preserve, parking lots, recreation center, playground, picnic area,
walkways, and aquatic center. Most of the improvements will be restricted to the
surface with little or no subsurface disturbance. The exception to this is the
proposed aquatic center. In one area, the swimming pool will extend to twelve
feet below the new ground surface once the area has been covered with four to
six feet of fill. In order to construct the baseball fields at the southern end of the
project area, the concrete foundations and roads associated with Camp Bowie
will be removed and recycled for other construction projects. This task will be
carried out by the National Guard.
This project was required in accordance with the State Antiquities Code
since the proposed project includes ground disturbance to clear land for
construction. Because volunteers from the Texas Military Forces will be using
equipment as part of the proposed park construction, there is also a requirement
to conduct Section 106 review to ensure compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act. In order to comply with the state and federal regulations, the
City of Brownwood retained BVRA of Bryan, Texas to conduct this investigation.
In addition to the cultural resources survey, the City of Brownwood retained SKG
Engineering of San Angelo to conduct a Phase I Environmental Assessment.
Their report not only describes the environment of the project area, but it also
includes a discussion of the features associated with Camp Bowie (SKG 2008).
The project area is depicted on the USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle
Brownwood (Figure 2).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Brown County is an area of rolling hills and varied soils that drains to the
Colorado River that forms the southern boundary of the county. According to
Clower (1980:1), the pattern of soils in Brown County is complex. He states that
four major geologic formations have influenced the nature of the soils. In Brown
County and adjacent Mills County, three major land resource areas converge. In
the eastern part of the area are the soils of the Grand Prairie; in the western part
of the area are soils of the Texas North Central Prairies, and in the northern part
of the area are soils of the West Cross Timbers. The soils of the Grand Prairie
and Texas North Central Prairies formed mainly under grass vegetation and are
dominantly dark colored and loamy and clayey. The soils of the West Cross
Timbers formed under post oak savannah and are dominantly light colored and
sandy and loamy.
According to the most recent soil survey for Brown and Mills counties,
there are three soil types present in the project area.* These soils are
superimposed on the project area map in Figure 3. They are Frio silty clay loam,
0 to 1 percent slopes, occasionally flooded (31), Nukrum-Urban land complex, 1
to 4 percent slopes (54), and Speck-Urban land complex, 1 to 3 percent slopes
(70). The 31 soil is found on flood plains, and the parent material consists of
loamy and clayey alluvium. This soil type is well drained, and the depth to the
water table is more than 80 inches. Occasional flooding is known to occur, and
the available water capacity is high at about 10.2 inches. A typical profile for this
soil type is silty clay loam at 0 to 7 inches, silty clay at 7 to 34 inches, and silty
clay at 34 to 80 inches. The 54 soil is found on fluvial terraces. This soil type is
well drained, and the depth to the water table is more than 80 inches. Flooding
does not occur with these soil types, and the available water capacity is high at
about 10.7 inches. A typical profile for this soil type is silty clay loam at 0 to 40
inches, silty clay at 40 to 56 inches, and silty clay at 56 to 80 inches. The 70 soil
is found on ridges, and the parent material is clayey alluvium over residium
weathered from limestone. This soil type is well drained, and the depth to the
water table is more than 80 inches. Flooding does not occur with these soil
types, and the available water capacity is very low at about 2.3 inches. A typical
profile for this soil type is clay loam at 0 to 7 inches, clay at 7 to 15 inches, and
bedrock at 15 to 40 inches. The elevation at the project area ranges from
approximately 1397 feet to 1380 feet with a general slope to the west-northwest
(based on geodetic north) towards South Willis Creek. This tract is outside the
500-year floodplain and is generally flat. According to Blair (1950), the project
area is located within the Balconian Biotic Province.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Brown County is located in the North Central Texas Cultural-Geographical
Region of Texas as defined by Biesaart et al. (1985) in a planning document
published by the Texas Historical Commission. There were 2678 recorded sites
in the region in 1985, and Brown County was ninth in the region that consists of
39 counties. Of the 95 recorded sites in Brown County in 1985, 2 are PaleoIndian, 1 is Late Archaic, 32 are General Archaic, and 2 are Late Prehistoric.
Disturbance to sites in the county is listed by Biesaart et al. (1985:184) as
erosion (n=95), construction (n=6), dispersed (n=25), vandalized (n=2), and
destroyed (n=1). Investigation at sites in the county in 1985 consisted of
excavated sites (n=1), sites tested by hand (n=3), sites tested by machine (n=2),
and surface collected sites (n=65). At the time of this survey, there were 558
recorded prehistoric and historic sites in the county, and the only six sites listed
in the in the National Register of Historic Places are in the city limits of
Brownwood. Only one site has been documented as a State Archeological
Landmark. This is the Brown County Jail, also in the city limits of Brownwood.
The earliest professional activity in Brown County occurred in 1919 when
Professor J. E. Pearce of The University of Texas at Austin trenched two burned
rock middens at the Pittman Farm site (41BR3) on Willis Creek, a tributary of
Pecan Bayou (Campbell 1952). No artifacts were found in either trench, and
Pearce concluded that the middens represent debris discarded from a central
hearth area. Other early work in the county was conducted by Cyrus N. Ray in
the 1930s. Ray (1933) examined a burial that was being destroyed by road
construction. In 1960, a guide to the literature of Texas archeology was
published by Thomas N. Campbell (1960) in the Bulletin of the Texas
Archeological Society. In this volume, only seven references to Brown County
were included. The first series of modern era professional investigations in the
county were carried out by archaeologists from Texas A&M University. Most of
these projects were in areas along Pecan Bayou (Shafer 1975; Shafer et al.
1975a, 1975b; 1976). These studies found a variety of sites that include lithic
scatters, burned rock middens, lithic quarries or procurement areas, rock
shelters, and habitation sites. Based on this work, they concluded that
prehistoric occupation was concentrated along the major streams, and the upper
reaches of tributaries were utilized on an occasional or intermittent basis. Many
of the archaeological sites in Brown County were recorded in the 1970s by locals
along Turkey Creek and Red River and scattered about the landscape in the
northern part of Brown County. The kinds of sites identified were mainly lithic
scatters and burned rock middens.

6

In 1979 and 1980, two field schools were sponsored by the Texas
Archeological Society on the Eubank Ranch on Pecan Bayou and some of its
tributaries under the direction of Gerald Humphreys. The kinds of prehistoric
sites found include ring middens, mound middens, a rock shelter, campsite, lithic
scatter, and burial site. Historic sites include houses, a mill, and a wagon road.
At this time there is no final report documenting the results of the two field
schools. Information can be found in articles and manuscripts by Humphreys
(1979, 1980), Teak and Eck (1979), and Hoffrichter and Davis (1981).
The nearest survey to the project area occurred in 1977 when work was
performed by George B. Kegley and Arthur Black (1978) when they examined a
tract adjacent to the current project area for the proposed Cordell and Camp
Bowie City Park sites. The area examined is immediately to the north of the
current project area along South Willis Creek. The site form only mentions one
artifact, a Perdiz arrow point found on the surface of a tributary of the creek (the
topographic map does not show a tributary in this area). However, a site number
(41BR89) was assigned, and the site is described as a lithic scatter or camp
located on a stream terrace that is two acres in size. The site was badly
disturbed and eroded at the time of their visit in 1977,
Especially relevant to this project, is a number of studies that have been
conducted at Camp Bowie. These investigations have identified and tested
prehistoric sites and historic sites associated with the World War II training camp.
They are discussed below.
In 2001, an archaeological survey of three land parcels (200 acres) and
testing of four archaeological sites at Camp Bowie was conducted by The
University of Texas at San Antonio, Center for Archaeological Research
(Greaves 2002). In Parcel 1, one previously unrecorded site (41BR522) was
identified as a small burned rock midden. One Late Prehistoric projectile point
fragment was recovered during shovel testing at site 41BR511. Excluding the
shovel tests dug at 41BR522, only three shovel tests within Parcel 1 contained
subsurface lithics, and these specimens were regarded as isolated finds. Thirtythree shovel tests were dug at Parcel 2, and they were negative. Forty-three
shovel tests were dug at Parcel 3. One shovel test yielded two heat-fractured
lithics that were identified as cultural in origin. Site 41BR522 was recommended
for additional testing to determine its eligibility for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark.
Previously recorded sites 41BR248, 41BR467, 41BR469, and 41BR471 were
visited and assessed. One site (41BR248) could not be relocated, as no surface
or subsurface artifacts were observed at the plotted site location. Four shovel
tests were excavated at 41BR467, a low-density lithic scatter, and no artifacts
were recovered. Four bifaces and two cores were collected from the surface,
however. Six shovel tests at 41BR469, a low density lithic scatter, produced a
single lithic, and there were no indications of subsurface deposits.

7

One shovel test was excavated at 41BR471, a small but relatively dense
lithic scatter. This test produced a single lithic, and there were no indications of
any subsurface deposits. One Late Prehistoric projectile point was collected
from the surface. Two additional sites (41BR392 and 41BR523) were shovel
tested. Site 41BR392 is a burned rock midden, and a Middle Archaic Bulverde
point was collected from the surface. Site 41BR523 is a World War II era live
grenade court. Shovel testing at this site was not considered necessary.
In 2001, an archaeological survey of 90 acres at Camp Bowie was
performed by The University of Texas at San Antonio, Center for Archaeological
Research (Mauldin and Broehm 2001). This study was carried out in a plowed
field, and 104 shovel tests were systematically placed within the tract. This study
identified and recorded three new prehistoric sites (41BR499, 41BR500, and
41BR501). An arrow point fragment was collected from the surface of 41BR499,
dating it to the Late Prehistoric period. Late Archaic dart points and a complete
mano were collected from site 41BR500, and an arrow point was collected from
site 41BR501. Based on the results of the pedestrian survey and the overall
condition of the sites, the researchers believe that sites 41BR499 and 41BR501
lack data of sufficient quality or quantity to qualify them for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark.
Site 41BR500, however, apparently contained intact subsurface deposits at the
edge of the plowed field. This site is considered to be potentially eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places and designation as a State
Archeological Landmark. Further work in the undisturbed portion of this site was
recommended.
In 1999 and 2001, archaeologists from the Center for Archaeological
Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio (Mauldin et al. 2003)
conducted National Register eligibility testing at 18 prehistoric sites within Camp
Bowie. These sites are 41BR65, 41BR87, 41BR228, 41BR246, 41BR250,
41BR253, 41BR261, 41BR276, 41BR415, 41BR420, 41BR433, 41BR441,
41BR473, 41BR474, 41BR478, 41BR480, 41BR492, and 41BR493. Sixteen of
the eighteen sites tested contained burned rock middens. Two sites (41BR262
and 41BR276) lacked burned rock middens, but they were tested based on the
presence of diagnostic projectile points and the potential for buried features.
Twelve of the sites tested were considered to be eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places and warrant designation as a State Archeological
Landmark. The remaining sites were found to lack clear evidence of significant
data, or they have data of questionable integrity. Some of these sites are listed
on the site form as quarry sites or workshops.

In 2001, archaeologists from the Center for Archaeological Research at
The University of Texas at San Antonio (Leffler 2002) conducted archaeological
investigations at seven historic sites (41BR227, 41BR266, 41BR270, 41BR290,
41BR299, 41BR438, and 41BR477) dating to the 19th and 20th centuries. These
sites represent sandstone walls, check dams built to control erosion, the remains
of a farmstead, bridges, and a bunker dating to the World War II era. In addition,
archival research was conducted. These sites had been previously recorded
during a site inventory of Camp Bowie conducted for the Adjutant General’s
Department of the Texas Army National Guard, Environmental Division, in the
1990s.
In 2003, archaeologists from the Center for Archaeological Research at
The University of Texas at San Antonio (Weston et al. 2003) conducted testing at
four prehistoric sites on Camp Bowie (41BR392, 41BR471, 41BR500, and
41BR522). Based on this testing project, sites 41BR471 and 41BR500 are not
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places and do not warrant
status as a State Archeological Landmark as they possess data of questionable
integrity. Sites 41BR392 and 41BR522 were found to have data with good
integrity (i.e., charcoal and ethno-botanical material), and they are considered to
be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places but not as a State
Archeological Landmark.
In 2006, SWCA Environmental Consultants conducted an oral history
project and historical archaeological investigations of seven sites at Camp Bowie
(41BR65, 41BR266, 41BR270, 41BR290, 41BR299, 41BR438, and 41BR477)
(Bonine and Steely 2006b). These sites are associated with the former training
activities at Camp Bowie up to and including its role in training soldiers during
World War II. The seven sites are classified as farming or ranching sites, soil
conservation structures built by the Civilian Conservation Corps, and a World
War II era military facility. The oral history project was designed to provide
sufficient historic context for the field investigation of the archaeological sites and
supply additional information on the history of Camp Bowie lands prior to World
War II. Its primary goal was to compile historic information on pre-Army history
and the War Years (circa 1880s to 1940s) of Camp Bowie through interviews
with former residents of the camp, archive this information for future generations,
and make it available in various formats to historical researchers and the general
public. As a result of this project, four of the seven sites were considered for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places. These are 41BR299 (a World
War II munitions bunker), 41BR270 and 41BR477 (check dams built by the
Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s), and 41BR438 (a historic farmstead).

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Archeological Site Atlas and the site records
at TARL were checked for previously recorded sites and past surveys in the
project area and vicinity. Archaeological reports relevant to the project area were
reviewed in order to ascertain the kinds of prehistoric sites known to occur in the
region and to become familiar with the history of Camp Bowie. The entire project
area was investigated by a 100% Pedestrian Survey along with shovel tests and
probes. Shovel tests were conducted randomly across the site and adjacent to
the cement foundations associated with Camp Bowie. All dirt excavated during
shovel testing was passed through ¼ inch hardware cloth, and information
regarding depth and soil conditions appears on a shovel test log (Appendix I). In
all, thirty-seven shovel tests were excavated (Figure 4). These tests were
shallow due to the presence of firm clay at the surface. Four exposed backhoe
trenches were present at the time of this survey. These trenches were
excavated by previous researchers searching for toxic soils. The profile of each
trench was examined and photographed (Figure 5). The historic concrete
features were measured, described, and photographed. No prehistoric artifacts
were observed or collected.

SITE DESCRIPTION
Site 41BR559 (Appendix II) consists of two major groupings of cement
foundations; two individual foundations or slabs; and a network of roads and
drives that date to the occupation of Camp Bowie, a World War II Training facility.
Camp Bowie was established as an infantry and artillery-training center for the
Texas Army National Guard, 36th Infantry Division. The emergence of this
military camp had a dramatic effect on the local economy as the population of the
county more than doubled as more than 10,000 construction workers helped
maintain the camp, and more than 30,000 soldiers trained there. Camp Bowie at
120,000 acres was the largest such facility in Texas, and it contained more than
8000 new buildings. In-depth research regarding the role of Camp Bowie as it
related to the area has been performed by Bonine and Steely (2006a, 2006b)
and SKG Engineering (2008). The interested reader is referred to these reports
for more information regarding Camp Bowie. The site area is depicted in a
drafted map (Figure 6) and on an aerial photograph taken in 2007 by Stewart
Geo Technologies (2007) (Figure 7). Some of the information that appears
below was taken from a Phase I Environmental Assessment prepared by SKG
Engineering (2008) for this project with the permission of the authors. In all, this
site contains the remnants of 15 structures labeled 1-15 on the site map (Figure
6). The paved road configuration suggests that either another five foundations
were present at one time or that the road was designed for buildings that were
never constructed. The amount of rip rap fill (comprised of old foundation
fragments) along the creek and gullies suggest that the buildings were
demolished, and the foundations were recycled as rip rap.
At the southern end of the project area is a large area of cement that was
numbered in the field as Feature 1. This feature consists of a six-inch thick
concrete pad adjacent to the street, a large foundation slab on which four fuel
storage tanks had been placed, and a building foundation. The slab was
elevated about two feet above the paved area. There were four channels formed
in the slab for pipes to drain the four fuel storage tanks through the use of gravity.
Marks on the concrete slab suggest that the fuel tanks had a diameter of fourteen
feet. Just south of the fuel storage slab are the remains of a large building
foundation that is part of the concrete paved area. This building is believed to be
part of the fuel depot. The feature was constructed and used by the Army when
Camp Bowie was active. There is an intrusive steel pipe framed structure on a
portion of the concrete paved area. This is a remnant of the later post-camp
agriculture venture. The location of the Camp Bowie feature is depicted the site
map for site 41BR559 (Figure 6) and an aerial photograph (Figure 7). A scale
drawing of this foundation is depicted below in Figure 8. Additional photographs
are on the compact disc at the back of this report as Appendix III (digital
photographs 5125-5131). No historic photographs of the structures in the project
area were available at the time of this survey.

In the south-central portion of the project area is a group of six large
rectangular foundations that supported wooden superstructures. These features
were numbered in the field as 2-7. According to a “Deed Without Warranty” filed
in Volume 509, Page 49 of the Brown County Deed Records, these features
functioned as warehouses. This instrument is dated 1963, and it transferred
ownership of this property from the United States Government to James Harlow.
According to the deed, there were “six structures located along the north right-of­
way for Farm-to-Market Road 45.” The deed describes them as warehouses
designated by building numbers 2435, 2436, 2437, 2438, 2439, and 2440, but we
were not able to match the features with these building numbers. The size of
each building is stated as 11,026 square feet. The warehouse features are
illustrated in Figure 9. These foundations consisted of foundation remains only
with the exception of Feature 5 that has remains of the truss system (Figure 9a,
9b, and 9c). Some of the foundations showed evidence of burning. Each
foundation has fourteen circular cement supports that were used to provide
support anchors for the truss structure (Figure 8; Figure 9d and 9e). The outer
and inner walls of the building were attached to a low seven-inch thick concrete
wall with spaces left open for pedestrian doors and garage or vehicle doors.
There are a series of inner walls along the long axis of each building. These
walls are along the northern elevation of some buildings and along the southern
elevation of other buildings (Figure 7). This pattern was designed to take
advantage of having a central paved system of driveways service two opposing
buildings (Figure 6). Feature 6 has a ramp that was apparently used as a truck
dock. This feature and the ramp are depicted in a photograph on the compact
disc at the back of this report as Appendix III (digital photographs 5163 and
5164). The location of these features is depicted on the Brownwood topographic
quadrangle (Figure 2), the site map for site 41BR559 (Figure 6), and an aerial
photograph (Figure 7). A scale drawing of a composite of the various foundations
is depicted below in Figure 10. These features are depicted in photographs on
the compact disc at the back of this report as Appendix III (digital photographs
5135-5153; 5158-5187; and 5190).
Just to the northwest of the warehouse buildings are two small cement
foundations listed as features 8 and 9. The types of structures these features
supported are unknown. The location of these features is depicted on the site
map for site 41BR559 (Figure 6) and an aerial photograph (Figure 7). These
features are depicted in photographs on the compact disc at the back of this
report as Appendix III (digital photographs 5152 and 5153).

Just to the west of these features is a single foundation (Feature 10) that
is part of the foundation group that represents vehicle maintenance structures.
This feature is identical to features 11-15 on the eastern side of the site, except
the foundation plan is a mirror image of the other plans. The feature type is
described below. The location of this feature is depicted on the site map for
41BR559 (Figure 6) and an aerial photograph (Figure 7). This feature is depicted
in photographs on the compact disc at the back of the report as Appendix III
(digital photographs 5154-5157).
Along the eastern boundary of the project area are five cement
foundations that are believed to have been associated with military motor pool
activities. These features (11-15) are concrete foundations that have pits formed
in them that suggest that they were likely used to access the underside of
vehicles for changing oil and general repairs (Figure 11). These foundations are
all the same in size and appearance. They have seven-inch concrete outside
wall forms that indicate the location of walls as well as pedestrian and vehicle or
garage doorways. The two pedestrian doors are located on the east and west
ends of the foundations, while the four garage openings are located along the
north and south walls providing a drive through both in and out of two work
areas. One area was over the mechanic’s pit, and the other was over a flat
section of the foundation slab. The mechanic’s pits have a set of concrete steps
on the north end that lead into the pit, a rebar steel rung ladder set into the south
end of the pit, five recessed areas for lights along the sides (two on the east and
three on the west), a large square bay built into the east wall that was probably
used for tool and supply storage, and a central sump in the center of the bottom
that was probably used to drain vehicle fluids (Figure 11a-f). The foundation was
poured over a concrete footing (Figure 11f). There were six small square
concrete support bases for vertical beams that supported the roof (Figure 11h).
The locations of these features are depicted on the topographic quadrangle
(Figure 2), the site map for site 41BR559 (Figure 6), and an aerial photograph
(Figure 7). A scale drawing of this foundation is depicted below in Figure 12.
Additional photographs are on the compact disc at the back of this report as
Appendix III (digital photographs 1465-1521).

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check revealed that a professional archaeologist had not
examined the project area, and no prehistoric archaeological sites are known to
be present. Previous surveys have documented prehistoric sites dating to the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods of Texas prehistory in the general area.
The majority of these sites are burned rock middens and lithic scatters. At the
time of this survey, the area was found to have been disturbed through
agricultural practices, as evidenced by terracing, and remnants of these terraces
were observed in the field and on an aerial photograph (Figure 7). The
vegetation near the creek consisted of thick stands of post oak and mesquite,
while the remainder of the site contained scattered mesquite and oak and
numerous clumps of prickly pear cactus.
No evidence of prehistoric occupation of the project area was found
through the pedestrian survey and shovel testing. BVRA believes the absence of
sites in the project area is due to an absence of sandy soils. The presence of
clay at or near the surface was probably not considered to be a preferred setting
for a campsite. There were no gravels on the surface that could have been used
to make stone tools. Therefore, the area would not have functioned as a lithic
procurement site. Just to the north of the current project area, an isolated find
consisting of an arrow point was recorded as an archaeological site (41BR89)
covering two acres. However, the report documenting the recording of this site
was not available at the time of this study, so any other information about the site
is not known. The portion of the project area along the creek just to the south of
41BR89 was thoroughly shovel tested, and the creek banks were examined.
An examination of the four backhoe trench profiles indicated that massive
soil disturbances had taken place. The top layer in all cases consisted of a
disturbed mixture of clay and caliche overlying dense clay and, in some cases,
limestone bedrock. Near the foundations, there was a subsurface caliche layer
beneath the mixed disturbed upper layer suggesting a caliche pad was placed
around the foundations during construction of Camp Bowie. The differences in
the published soil survey soil descriptions and the soil profiles and shovel tests
observations are probably due to a massive amount of surface disturbance and
erosion.
The only remains of military activity are the cement foundations, streets,
and driveways in the southern end of the project area. These remains have been
assigned the official trinomial 41BR559.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No prehistoric archaeological sites were found during this survey. Historic
site 41BR559 is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or
for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. It is, therefore, recommended
that construction be allowed to proceed as planned without further consultation with
the THC. Should construction plans change to include a larger area, the THC must
be notified in case additional survey by a professional archaeologist is warranted.
Also, if prehistoric cultural materials are unearthed during construction, all work in
the area of the find must stop until the THC can evaluate the situation. This study
conformed to the Minimum Survey Standards as defined by the Archaeology
Division of the THC.
