ABSTRACT
An archeological survey within the Turkey Creek Unit of the Big Thicket
National Preserve in Hardin and Tyler counties, Texas was conducted by Brazos
Valley Research Associates (BVRA); Edward P. Baxter, Consulting Archeologist;
and a team of archeologists assembled by and contracted through Dixie
Environmental Services Co., LP (DESCO). The project commenced on August
18, 2006 and ended on November 12, 2006 when the final archeological site was
delineated, and the remaining source points were moved.
That portion of the Big Thicket National Preserve where this study took
place consists of 9756 acres. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is 1040 acres.
Within the APE, shovel testing was conducted at source points identified by
surveyors working in advance of the archeologists and high probability areas
identified prior to the field survey based on an examination of the topographic
maps. Areas surveyed include the source lines and all reroutes.
The current study recorded 15 new archeological sites. Eight are in Hardin
County (41HN43 - 41HN50), and seven are in Tyler County (41TL79 – 41TL85).
Thirteen sites are prehistoric, and two sites (41HN28 and 41HN48) have both a
prehistoric and historic component. Two previously recorded sites (41HN16 and
41HN28) were accidentally shovel tested because they were not correctly plotted
at TARL. This testing led to the addition of a prehistoric component at site
41HN28 and an increase in site size at 41HN16. Six previously recorded sites
(41HN14, 41HN16, 41HN17, 41HN25, 41HN28, and 41TL59) were visited, and a
site revisit form was completed for each of these sites. Three of the previously
recorded sites (41HN14, 41HN16, and 41HN28) are prehistoric, and three sites
(41HN17. 41HN25, and 41TL59) are historic.
Most of the prehistoric sites in the project area are located in shallow soils
and contain a low density of artifacts, often with no diagnostics present. Also, no
evidence of intact features was observed at any of the prehistoric sites. Archaic
dart points were found at three sites (41HN43, 41TL79, and 41TL85), and four of
the newly recorded sites (41HN44, 41HN48, 41HN49, and 41TL82) produced
pottery. One sherd was reported by the original recorders at 41HN16. These
diagnostics are evidence that prehistoric groups inhabited the project area during
the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods of Texas prehistory. The survey crew
noted an absence of gravels in the nearby streams, and few non-cultural lithics
(shatter) were recovered during shovel testing. The projectile points were all
made from silicified wood, which is found locally, and the debitage consists of
other local materials such as chert, opal, and opalized wood.

ii

Twelve sites are viewed as possessing unknown eligibility for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. These sites are 41HN14, 41HN16,
41HN17, 41HN25, 41HN44, 41HN45, 41HN48, 41HN49, 41TL59, 41TL79,
41TL82, and 41TL85. Nine sites have been determined to be ineligible for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places. No further work is necessary at
41HN28, 41HN43, 41HN46, 41HN47, 41HN50, 41TL80, 41TL81, 41TL83, and
41TL84.
There are no known historic cemeteries or communities within the project
area. All artifacts will be placed in permanent curation at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) on the campus of The University of Texas at
Austin.

INTRODUCTION
In accordance with National Park Service regulations for non-federal oil
and gas rights, Seismic Assistants, Ltd. submitted a Plan of Operations (permit
application) to the National Park Service to conduct a three-dimensional (3-D)
seismic survey within the Turkey Creek Unit, Big Sandy Creek Corridor, and
Village Creek Corridor; all located in the Big Thicket National Preserve, as well
as other lands managed by the National Park Service. The proposed survey will
cover approximately 15.24 square miles (9756 acres) of park service lands in
Hardin and Tyler counties, Texas (Figure 1). The project area is depicted on four
USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangles. They are Hicksbaugh (3094-421), Kountze
North (3094-134), Village Mills (3094-133), and Warren (3094-422). The project
area superimposed on these maps appears as Appendix I to this report.
The permittee for this project is Seismic Assistants, Ltd. of Houston,
Texas, and the contact person for this firm is John Sadler. A cultural resource
survey was performed in order to fulfill the requirements of the National Historic
Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 460), Section 106, for the issuance of a special use
permit by the National Park Service. As part of this study, the National Park
Service issued Archeological Resource Protection Act (ARPA) permit 06BITH2 to
William E. Moore of BVRA. This report was prepared for submission to the
National Park Service and the Texas Historical Commission.
The purpose of the seismic survey is to provide a high-resolution image of
the subsurface geological features that will allow the client to effectively evaluate
hydrocarbon reserves (if any) underlying the 380 square-mile project area. The
client plans to use a dynamite energy source with a charge size of 5.5 pounds.
The depth of the charges will be 120 feet below the existing land surface. All
shot holes will be approximately four inches in diameter. The distance between
each shot hole and receiver line will be 220 feet, and the distance between shot
lines and receiver lines will be 1760 feet. Following detonation, each hole will be
plugged with betonite (natural clay) in accordance with Texas Railroad
Commission Rule 100 for the prevention of co-mingling of surface and ground
water. The equipment to be used in the majority of the project area will consist of
Highland Drill rigs and standard seismic operating equipment. In the Big Thicket
National Preserve, an Articulating Tractor Drill will be use to minimize impact to
the terrain. One hole will be drilled at each source point location. Drilling is
scheduled to begin in late 2006 to early 2007,

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
The project area is located in Hardin and Tyler counties in Southeast
Texas. The following information was taken from the soil survey for Hardin
County (United States Department of Agriculture 2005), the Soil Survey of the
Big Thicket Preserve (Deshotels 1978), and an overview of the area by DESCO
(2006). The project area is located within the Lower Coastal Plain geographic
area of Southeast Texas. The land surface is gently rolling with a vast network of
creeks, rivers, floodplains, and wetlands. The annual rainfall in the area
averages 50 inches. Figures 2 and 3 depict the varied terrain in the project area.
Vegetation
At the time of this survey, the only general vegetation studies conducted
specific to the Turkey Creek Unit were performed by G. E. Watson in 1974 and
1978. Harcombe and Marks (1979) predicted 11 vegetation community types
present in this unit. These are Upland Pine Forest, Wetland Pine Forest,
Sandhill Pine Forest, Upper Slope Pine Oak Forest, Mid Slope Oak Pine Forest,
Lower Slope Hardwood Pine Forest, Flatland Hardwood Forest, Floodplain
Hardwood Pine Forest, Floodplain Hardwood Forest, Swamp Cypress-Tupelo
Forest, and Wetland Baygall Thicket. The website www.natureserve.org lists 89
potential vegetation alliances that occur in Southeast Texas and the Big Thicket
National Preserve as classified by the International Classification of Ecological
Communities. DESCO conducted a vegetation assessment of the Turkey Creek
Unit in the spring and summer of 2006 in order to map and characterize
vegetation present within the Turkey Creek Unit prior to the Knight Phase IV 3-D
seismic survey. The interested reader is referred to this document for in-depth
information regarding the vegetation of the project area.
Geology
The majority of the project area within the Big Thicket National Preserve is
comprised of the Lissie Formation, which dates to the Pleistocene Epoch. The
upper and lower parts of this formation are composed of clay, silt, sand, and very
minor siliceous gravel of granule and small pebble size; however, the gravel in
the lower part is slightly coarser than in the upper part. The Lissie Formation is
fairly flat and featureless except for numerous rounded shallow depressions and
pimple mounds. Thickness of this formation is approximately 200 feet.

The portions of the Turkey Creek Unit and Village Creek Corridor Unit
along Turkey Creek, Hickory Creek, and Village Creek are comprised mainly of
undivided fluviatile terrace deposits interspersed with small outcrops of alluvium
along the creek corridors. Undivided fluviatile terraces date to the Pleistocene
Epoch, and these deposits are generally composed of gravel, sand, and silt in
deposits along valley walls and may include some terraces cut in older rock.
Alluvium is also present in the area and dates to the Holocene Epoch. It consists
of clay, silt, and sand with organic matter locally abundant. It includes point bar,
natural levee, stream channel, and back swamp deposits.
The remaining portion of the project area is comprised of the Willis
Formation, which dates to the Pleistocene Epoch. It is composed of clay, silt,
sand, and siliceous gravel of granule to pebble size including some silicified
wood. The materials are non-calcareous, mostly deeply weathered and lateritic,
indurated by clay and cemented by iron oxide locally. Iron oxide concretions are
less abundant in this formation, and the amount of weathering decreases
eastward in a landward belt of outcrop. Thickness of this formation is
approximately 100 feet.
Within the Big Thicket National Preserve there are stream channels,
floodplains and slopes associated with drainages and a few uplands bordering
the slopes. Slopes typically range between 0 percent and 8 percent with general
surface flow to the south. Numerous soils have been identified in the project
area. The interested reader is referred to the environmental assessment by
DESCO (2006) for an in-depth discussion of soil types.
Drainages
The dominant surface water features within the preserve portion of the
project area include Hickory Creek, Turkey Creek, and Village Creek. These
watersheds exhibit features common to major drainages in the area such as
sloughs, swamps, and backwater ponds. Other creeks in the area include Big
Cypress Creek, Hunters Creek, Theuvenins Creek, and Touching Creek. Drakes
Branch and several smaller unnamed tributaries are also present. The nearest
river is the Neches River, which is located to the east.

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
General
According to a published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Hardin and Tyler
counties are situated within the Southeast Texas Archeological Study Region.
Biesaart et al. (1985:96) place these counties in the Southeast Texas culturalgeographical region in a statistical overview published by the Texas Historical
Commission. This is an area well documented in terms of numbers of sites when
compared to other regions in Texas. When the statistical overview was
published in 1985, a total of 1630 sites (8.06 percent of the state) were recorded
in the entire region. Only four of the thirteen regions reported more sites or had a
higher percentage statewide. In terms of county statistics; however, Hardin
County was last in the region in 1985 with only nine recorded prehistoric sites
(Biesaart et al. 1985:143), and Tyler County was tied for 18th place with twenty
recorded sites (Biesaart et al. 1985:88). In 1985, known sites in Hardin County
dated to the Late Archaic (n=1) and Late Prehistoric (n=7). No information was
available for the ninth site. In Tyler County, three sites were listed as General
Archaic, and 17 sites were listed as Late Prehistoric. Disturbance in the area was
common. Sites are described as being affected by erosion, construction, and
vandalism. No sites in either county have been excavated, although several have
been tested by hand and surface collected. The statistical overview does not
mention site numbers; therefore, the above data provide only a general picture of
the condition of sites in Hardin County in 1985. According to the planning
document for the Eastern Planning Region of Texas by the Texas Historical
Commission (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:11), site density in 1993 was 0.001 to
0.1 sites per square mile for both counties. The authors list the following threats
to archeological resources in the county as reservoir construction, oil and gas
production, and the timber industry. Known immigrant Indian villages in the
county belong to the Coushatta and Taensa tribes (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:172). The interested reader is advised to consult Chapter 2.6 of the
planning document (Effects of European Contact on Native and Immigrant
Indians) for more information concerning historic Indians in the area.
Based on previous work in the general area, prehistoric sites are most
likely found on sandy ridges and knolls adjacent to streams, sloughs, and springs
that contained water in the prehistoric past. Prehistoric sites may also be found
in the floodplains of streams as low rises or mounds. Isolated finds or small
concentrations of prehistoric artifacts may be found throughout the area.
Although rock art is scarce in East Texas, one recorded example is the Gibson
Petroglyph site (41TN12) located on a sandstone overhang in Trinity County. In
a midden beneath the overhang, Archaic and Late Prehistoric artifacts, as well as
glass trade beads, were recovered by local collectors. Although surface finds of
Paleo-Indian points have been reported in the area, no known sites of this period
have been found in Hardin or Tyler counties.

6

The majority of prehistoric sites are Archaic and Late Prehistoric in age.
The most common features are hearths and fire pits. Burials are less common
but are present at some sites. Proto-Historic and Historic Indian sites are also
rare.
Historic sites are not always tied to water and may be present anywhere
on the landscape. In the project area, for example, there are rural houses and
outbuildings associated with farming. In many cases, the water for these sites
was obtained through wells. Small unmarked family cemeteries are also present,
as are the larger dedicated cemeteries associated with local communities and
towns.
No sites in the current project area are listed in the National Register of
Historic Places, and no sites have been designated as a State Archeological
Landmark.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
General
The first person to enter the project area and record archeological sites
was Gus E. Arnold, a researcher at The University of Texas at Austin working for
the Works Progress Administration (WPA) (Guy 1988). He traveled throughout
East Texas in the 1940s and documented sites. Some were tested. Arnold took
some notes and recorded his findings on early site forms in addition to making
collections and taking photographs. His site plottings were not always precise;
therefore, later researchers have not confirmed the location of many of his sites.
TARL personnel, based on the best available information regarding the location
of these sites, later assigned official state trinomials. Not one of the sites
recorded by Arnold is located within the current project area.
The surveys discussed below recorded few sites when compared to the
larger reservoir studies in the area. Major studies include Dam “B” Reservoir
(Stephenson 1949); Steinhagen Lake in Jasper and Tyler counties (Perttula et al.
1998), Rockland Reservoir along the Neches River in Angelina, Polk, Tyler, and
Trinity counties (never constructed) (Jelks 1954), and McGee Bend in Angelina,
Jasper, Nacogdoches, Sabine, and San Augustine counties (Stephenson 1948;
Tunnell 1961; Jelks 1965). Data from these surveys and those in the project
area were used to identify high probability areas to be avoided by drilling.
Investigations in the Project Area
The first professional survey in the project area was an archeological
study of the prehistoric resources in the Big Thicket National Preserve. This
study was conducted by Texas A&M University (TAMU) in 1974 and 1975 under
the supervision of Harry J. Shafer (Shafer et al. 1975). Edward P. Baxter was
the field archeologist. Although this survey visited parts of all units in the Big
Thicket National Preserve, only a portion of the southern half of the Turkey Creek
Unit was surveyed by TAMU due to wet weather and lack of permission by
certain landowners. It should be stated here that this survey was carried out
using survey standards of the day, with no shovel testing being performed.
TAMU archeologists recorded three sites in Hardin County and one site in Tyler
County. Not one of the sites is in the current project area.

8

A second investigation by TAMU was a historical survey of all units within
the Big Thicket National Preserve by researchers from the TAMU Research
Foundation (Treat and Dethloff 1978). Their report does not state the year that
they conducted their fieldwork. They recorded seven historic sites, and three of
these are in the current project area. In Hardin County, they recorded a 20th
century cabin (41HN25) that probably dates to the 1930s or 1940s and a historic
hunting camp (41HN28) that was in use in the 1930s. Neither site was
considered significant and worthy of additional work. In Tyler County, they
recorded 41TL59, an early Texas homestead. It was recommended that this
house be protected.
In 1986, Sheldon Kindall of the Houston Archeological Society (HAS)
undertook a summer project designed to document and record prehistoric sites
that had been visited by local artifact collector Andy Kyle between 1946 and
1986. Although Kyle did not write a formal report of his activities, he kept notes
that allowed his collection to be correlated by site. His vast collection of projectile
points was documented by HAS member Leland W. Patterson (1986) who
published his findings in the Journal of the Houston Archeological Society.
Kindall visited seven sites in the project area. Kyle’s collection is on display at
the Sam Houston Regional Library and Research Center in Liberty, Texas. One
of the sites recorded by Kyle (41HN14) is located within the current project area.
This is a prehistoric site that is described on the site form as an unknown
prehistoric campsite that needs to be revisited.
Heartfield, Price & Greene, Inc. (1988) conducted an archeological survey
of a well pad and access road in the Turkey Creek Unit in 1988 and recorded site
41HN16. This prehistoric site yielded a Perdiz arrow point base and flakes from
two shovel tests. The site is located on a sandy knoll overlooking Village Creek
and a nearby stagnant slough that may be a relict channel of the creek. It was
considered to be ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
because of the low density of cultural materials in the 300 x 350 foot well pad
tract. This site is discussed in the Big Thicket inventory by Moore Archeological
Consulting (Dureka and Moore 2003) as not significant. The report by Heartfield,
Price & Greene, Inc. states that the core of the site may be elsewhere.
TxDOT archeologists examined a section of United States Highway 69 in
Hardin County in 1996 within the project area. No sites were found, and no
report is on file at TARL. This information was taken from the Texas Historic
Sites Atlas.

9

Moore Archeological Consulting conducted an archeological survey of
proposed construction areas within the Turkey Creek Unit in 1997 (Jackson and
Moore 1997). This survey identified an early to middle 20th century cabin
(41HN17) that was being used by the forest service as visitor center. The
researchers state that this site reflects patterns of homesteading during the early
to middle 20th century in Southeast Texas, especially the adaptation and survival
of low-income families during the Great Depression. They believe the cabin has
research potential and may be eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places or designation as a State Archeological Landmark.
Moore Archeological Consulting performed a cultural resource inventory
culminating in a Geographical Information System (GIS) project database for the
entire Big Thicket National Preserve (Dureka and Moore 2003). Report extracts
for 63 cultural resource surveys were compiled and assembled into an ArcView
database.
Archeologists from Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas, Inc.
(Campbell 2001) examined 23 high probability areas (525 acres) along United
States Highway 69 in Hardin and Tyler counties. Previously recorded sites
41HN14 and 41TL14 were visited and evaluated. Site 41HN14 was not formally
assessed since it was not within the highway right-of-way and will not be affected
by the proposed construction. Site 41TL14 is a mound located on a small rise in
the floodplain of Big Turkey Creek. Numerous sloughs were observed near the
site. An Archaic Evans dart point was collected through shovel testing. This site
is described on the site form as Middle Archaic or Caddoan. This survey also
recorded a possible sawmill as 41TL73. Campbell recommended future work at
sites 41TL14 and 41TL73. Not one of the sites recorded or revisited during this
project are within the current seismic project area.

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF THE BIG THICKET
There are numerous sources that document the history of the Big Thicket
and vicinity. The following overview was taken from the Handbook of Texas
Online which cited the following sources: Tales from the Big Thicket by Francis
E. Abernathy, editor (1966); The Big Thicket: A Challenge of Conservation, by
Pete Addison Gunter (1971); The Big Thicket: An Ecological Reevaluation, by
Pete Addison Gunter (1983); Big Thicket Legacy, by Campbell Loughmiller and
Lynn Loughmiller (1977); and The Big Thicket of Texas: America’s Ecological
Wonder, by Howard Peacock (1984). Other sources used by the authors of this
report include Imperial Texas: An Interpretive Essay in Cultural Geography, by D.
W. Meinig (1969) and Indians of the Upper Texas Coast, by Lawrence E. Aten
(1983)
The Big Thicket of Southeast Texas is difficult to define geographically.
Early explorers referred to a very large area as the Big Thicket. By their
definition, it included all wooded lands south of the Old San Antonio Road (OSR),
east of the Brazos River, north of the coastal prairie and the La Bahia Road, and
lands west of the Sabine River. Following settlement of the area by early
pioneers, the area known as the Big Thicket became more tightly defined.
However, it has never been absolutely delineated, even to this day. One of the
ways it has been defined by scientists is by soil types and vegetation. Early
families in the area refer to the Big Thicket as a much smaller area, and they
gave call it the bear hunters’ thicket. The traditional bear hunters’ thicket is about
40 miles long and 20 miles wide at its widest part. It consists of flat land, gray
clay and sand, and is part of the Pine Island Bayou drainage system. The
northern boundaries began in the southern parts of Polk and Taylor counties,
where the creeks flow out of the red dirt hills, and ended in the south below Sour
Lake where the dense woods thin out in stands of pine and in the rice farms of
the coastal prairie. Before logging reduced the size of the forests, the eastern
and western boundaries were easier to define. The eastern boundary, east of
Cypress Creek, is higher in elevation, and the soil is sandy. At one time, there
used to be great climax stands of yellow pine five and six feet in diameter. The
western boundary was marked by large open pine stands along the spoil banks
of the Trinity River and by Batson Prairie on the southwest. Before the lumber
and oil industries intruded into the area, the heart of the thicket was
characterized by dense vegetation and by large numbers of deer, bear, panthers,
and wolves, as well as the common varieties of mammals, birds, reptiles, and
amphibians. The Big Thicket is possibly the most biologically diverse area in the
world. Plant life includes cactus, ferns, beech trees, orchids, camellias, azaleas,
and four carnivorous plants. These plants co-exist with the pines, oaks, and
gums common to the rest of East Texas. It is noted for the many species of birds
(around 350) that either live in the area or visit annually. The large numbers of
plants and animals are supported by a long growing season (around 246 days)
and abundant rainfall.

11

Indian Groups
Three Indian bands are historically associated with the early history of the
Big Thicket: the Atakapa, Caddo, and Alabama-Coushatta. At first, only the
Atakapa and Caddo visited the Big Thicket with any regularity. Other tribes from
Oklahoma, Colorado, and Kansas are reported to have made periodic hunting
trips into the area for bear meat, skins, and tallow. At the area now referred to as
Sour Lake, the Tonkawa, Lipan Apaches, and Wichita met in peace at a
medicinal spring. Mainly, the thicket was home to the Caddos who occupied the
hills to the north and the Atakapa who bounded the Big Thicket on the Gulf Coast
and Trinity River bottoms. At the end of the eighteenth century, the Alabamas
and Coushattas began to settle on the northern and western fringes of the Big
Thicket.
Anglo Settlers
The first non-Indian to lay a personal claim to the area was Lorenzo de
Zavala whose 1829 Mexican land grant included the Big Thicket. No Mexicans
came, however, and the first settlers to move into the Big Thicket area were
Anglo-Americans who began moving into Southeast Texas in the 1830s. The
first settlers stopped on the eastern edge of the Big Thicket. The early economy
was based on survival from the land, similar to their Indian neighbors. The core
of the population of the Big Thicket is still white, Anglo-Saxon, and Protestant.
Few blacks live in the area today. Since the area with its dense woods did not
lend itself to plantation farming, few (if any) slaves and field hands ever lived
there. There are a few Cajuns on the southwestern edge in the Batson Prairie
area, and a few Slavonians left over from the days of tie cutting and stave
making in the thicket. Also, some “foreigners” stayed behind following their work
in the sawmills or during the oil boom.
Economy of the Big Thicket
The economic history of the thicket is much the same as that of the rest of
East Texas. Until the 1880s, the inhabitants were scattered throughout the
thicket and lived on subsistence farms. They let their hogs and cattle range
rather freely, and they hunted small game as well as deer and bear. In the
1880s, the lumber industry created a new and vibrant economy in the area. As a
result, virgin pine trees were cut and more land was opened for farming and
grazing. Although the original boom slowed after 1887, the lumber business
remained the only important industry in Hardin County until after 1900. Some of
the local communities that were tied to the lumber industry were Hicksbaugh (the
closest settlement to the project area), Hyatt, Lumberton, Olive, Village Mills, and
Warren. There are no communities within the current project area. Today, one of
the reminders of this industry is a series of now abandoned trams that served as
the principal means of moving lumber from the forest to the main railroad line
which transported the timber to the sawmill. They also served as a basic system
of transportation for the front camp workers.

12

The front camp workers usually had families living in the primary mill
towns, and they utilized this network of trams as their major source of getting
from one place to another. Trams were extended throughout the forests as the
logging fronts advanced to new areas of virgin timber. These trams often created
an intricate network of cleared routes that would eventually become the basis for
a fully developed rural transportation system of Farm-to-Market roads. Trams
were numerous throughout East Texas. It was not uncommon for loggers to only
have to haul cut timber about one-quarter mile by mule or horse to reach the
nearest tram. Trams were also very crudely constructed. Often crossties from
Sweet gum and other available trees were used with spiking occasionally
employed. The tram roads, because of their temporary nature, were not tied
together as well as roads that were expected to last more than a year or two.
Instead of ties being spaced a foot apart, they may have been spaced two or
three feet apart and with very crude ties, perhaps only flat on one side. The
object was to create a tram that would allow the locomotive to transport the logs
with the least work and cost. Although horses, mules, and oxen were used to
pull wagons on some of the early East Texas trams, the steam locomotive
quickly replaced this mode of transportation and became the most efficient way
to move timber. One of the locomotives used in the area was the Shay
locomotive, which was invented by Ephraim Shay from Michigan in the 1870s.
His invention was so effective that in 1878 he was able to reduce his selling price
on lumber from $3.50 per thousand board feet to $1.25 per thousand board feet.
Trams were not always elevated and, as a result, evidence of their existence did
not survive in every case. If the weather was dry and the ground was not
swampy, trams may have been built as a level road in places. Elevation was
desirable when a stable and dry route was needed or in order to avoid a steep
grade. In low areas the added dirt was called a “fill.” Sometimes trams had to cut
through a hill. Most trams in East Texas had many cuts and fills. The Kirby
Lumber Company was the primary landowner and operator in East Texas, which
included the Big Thicket. The above information was taken from several online
sites and a conversation with Jonathan K. Gerland of The History Center in
Diboll, Texas.
In 1901, oil was discovered, and the Sour Lake oilfield brought outsiders
to the area seeking work. This new means of income helped revitalize
communities such as Village Mills. The lumber industry at Village Mills suffered
greatly when the Kirby Lumber Company closed the mill in the early 1930s. The
discovery of nearby deposits of oil and natural gas in 1945 brought new jobs to
those displaced by the end of the lumber boom.

13

Following the boom of these new industries, life returned to its normal,
rural pace and remained that way through the 1930s. World War II created a
change that was never overcome. Many of the locals left to serve in the military
or work in the shipyards, and many of them never returned. Following the war,
the area changed with the creation of paved roads and power lines. The bulk of
the population is now located in Kountze, Honey Island, Sour Lake, Saratoga,
and Batson.
Railroads
One of the by-products of the lumber boom was the arrival of the railroad
to East Texas and the Big Thicket. The nearest railroad to the project area was
the Texas and New Orleans Railroad Company. This railroad was first chartered
in 1856 as the Sabine and Galveston Bay Railroad Company for the purpose of
constructing a railroad from Madison, Texas (now Orange) in Orange County to
Galveston Bay. In 1859, the name was changed to the Texas and New Orleans
Railroad Company. Other railroads that operated in the area were The Sabine
and East Texas railroad, the Texas and North-Eastern Railway, the Gulf,
Colorado, the Beaumont, Sour Lake and Western Railroad, and the Santa Fe,
the East Texas and Gulf Railway.
The Sabine and East Texas railroad arrived in 1881. It entered Hardin
County at its southeastern corner then extended through the north-central
section before crossing the county line after passing through Village Mills. In
1900, the Texas and North-Eastern Railway was chartered. By June of that year,
the company was operating five miles of track from Village Mills to Wick. By
June 1901, the Railroad Commissioner had determined that it was merely a
logging road for the Village Mills Company and dropped the railroad from its list
of common carriers. The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe, a component of the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe system, crossed northern Hardin County from
west to east in 1901 and 1902. The Beaumont, Sour Lake and Western Railroad
passed through southern Hardin County between 1904 and 1908. The East
Texas and Gulf Railway was established on August 1, 1917 to serve the interests
of the Loderick Lumber Company in Hicksbaugh and Hyatt. In October of that
year, this railroad completed 3.9 miles between Hyatt where it connected with the
Texas and New Orleans to Hicksbaugh. It also operated over the logging tract of
the Loderick Lumber Company from Hicksbaugh to Wurtsbaugh, while the
lumber company also ran log trains over the tracks of the East Texas and Gulf
Railway. The mill at Hicksbaugh closed in 1928, and the railroad was
abandoned in 1934.

Creation of the Big Thicket National Preserve
Formal efforts to save the Big Thicket from the devastation of the lumber
and oil industries began with the founding of the East Texas Big Thicket
Association by R. E. Jackson in 1927. It was the intent of the association to
preserve 400,000 acres as a national forest. One result of this movement was a
biological survey of the Big Thicket in 1936 by H. B. Parks and V. L. Cory of the
Texas Agricultural Experiment Station. The conservation movement suffered a
setback due to World War II because of the need for pine lumber and
hardwoods. In the early 1960s, there was an attempt to make the area into a
state park. This movement was led by Lance Rosier was, a long time thicket
guide and naturalist, and the mayor of Liberty, Dempsie Henly. Together, they
founded the Big Thicket Association on October 4, 1964. In 1974, Charles
Wilson and Bob Eckhardt sponsored a bill to set aside 84,550 acres as the Big
Thicket National Preserve. It was passed by Congress and signed by President
Gerald Ford.
The preserve today consists of twelve protected units in Harding, Jasper,
Liberty, Polk, and Tyler counties. Some of these units are in the heart of the old
bear hunter’s thicket. Not mentioned in the accounts documented by the
Handbook of Texas Online is the effort made by Geraldine Watson and Maxine
Johnston to save certain sections of the thicket at an early date (Watson
2003:184-194; personal communication from Jonathan K. Gerland on November
13, 2006 to William E. Moore).

METHODS
Pre-Field Methods
Prior to entering the field, the Project Archeologist visited TARL on the
campus of The University of Texas at Austin. At TARL, all relevant topographic
maps were checked for the presence of previously recorded prehistoric and
historic sites and areas surveyed. In addition, a search of the Texas Historic
Sites Atlas was performed, and relevant archeological reports in the area were
reviewed. During the course of the survey the Principal Investigator contacted
the Maps GIS Room at the Sterling C. Evans Library, the Cushing Memorial
Library and Archives at Texas A&M University, the Sam Houston Regional
Library and Research Center in Liberty, Texas, and The History Center in Diboll,
Texas. When possible, aerial photographs were checked for the presence of
logging roads and trams.
Field Methods
The overall goal of this study was to locate and evaluate archeological
sites within the project area so that avoidance measures could be implemented
during the proposed seismic activities. The field methods followed during this
project were based on previous archeological surveys and results within the
preserve and incorporated shovel testing along the source point locations as
specified below. Receiver lines were not surveyed as no adverse impacts to
archeological sites were anticipated in these areas.
Following establishment of the 3-D seismic corridors and locations of
proposed source points, the field crews conducted a 100 percent pedestrian
survey covering 15 meters (50 feet) on either side of each access route
centerline. The total survey width was 30 meters (100 feet). Archeologists
visually inspected all eroded and disturbed areas for surface artifacts associated
with archeological sites and/or features.
At or near each proposed source point location, field crews excavated one
to three shovel tests to determine if buried cultural materials were present in the
Area of Potential Effect (APE). High probability areas were tested with three
shovel tests; one at the proposed source point and two at 10-meter radials in
different directions. When cultural materials were recovered at these proposed
source point locations, crews delineated the site boundaries by excavating
additional shovel tests in all four cardinal directions and/or along landforms at
intervals of 10 meters (30-feet). Site boundaries were determined when two
consecutive, negative shovel tests were excavated in each of the four directions.
Archeological site boundaries were marked so these areas can be avoided
during later drilling operations.

16

Holocene deposits were shovel tested by hand in 10-centimeter levels to a
depth of one meter or until Pleistocene clay or standing water was reached. The
excavated soil was passed through quarter-inch hardware cloth. All shovel tests
were backfilled to original ground level following excavation.
BVRA shovel test forms were completed for each test and included the
following information: (1) seismic grid coordinates, (2) depth of each shovel test,
(3) depth of cultural materials, (4) kinds of artifacts recovered, and (5) type of soil
present. Munsell color chart readings were taken where appropriate. All artifacts
found in shovel tests were collected for analysis in the laboratory. A list of those
artifacts removed from the preserve was submitted to the National Park Service
(NPS). Later, an accession number for each specimen in the inventory was
Once analyzed and inventoried, no artifacts will be discarded, and all specimens
were cataloged per the conditions of the ARPA permit. Other notable specimens
encountered were described in the field notes and left in place assigned by the
NPS.
When an archeological site was found and its boundaries determined, it
was assigned a field number. All sites were documented through field notes,
shovel test logs (Appendix II), sketch maps, and digital photography. The
location of the approximate center of each site, along with the location of any
isolated diagnostic surface artifacts within the 3-D seismic corridor, were
calculated using a hand-held GPS unit (using the NPS required NAD 83 datum),
and the location of each site was plotted on the appropriate USGS 7.5’
topographic quadrangle.
The boundaries of all newly recorded sites and all previously recorded
sites were marked with red-and-white flagging tape. The only exception was site
41HN17. This historic site is a standing structure that was renovated for use as a
visitor center by the park service. The decision was made not to flag this site
because it would be a visual distraction to the area.
All shovel tests yielding cultural materials were considered positive. In the
laboratory, however, some lithics were determined to be non-cultural and are
described in this report as shatter. Although shatter is not recognized as a tool
type or debitage, the material was probably brought to the area by the prehistoric
groups who occupied the sites where it was found. Therefore, the shovel tests
that contained this material are labeled as positive in this report.
Completed forms for each archeological site were submitted to TARL
where, after receiving the necessary documentation, state trinomial site numbers
were assigned.

17

Laboratory Analyses and Database Entries
Standard procedures for analyzing artifacts were followed. All artifacts
were examined by a professional with an expertise in lithic and ceramic
technology.
Per the ARPA permit conditions, all artifacts recovered will be cataloged in
the NPS service wide curatorial data base (ANCS+) and all archeological sites
will be entered into the NPS service wide archeological database (ASMIS). The
NPS will provide the necessary software and/or access to these data bases.
Report Preparation and Submission
Following completion of all fieldwork, three copies of the draft report were
submitted to the NPS for review; one was submitted to the Big Thicket National
Preserve, one was submitted to the regional office Archeology Program, and one
was submitted to the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Following review by
these agencies, all comments were addressed in the final report, and the
requisite number of final report copies were delivered to all concerned parties.
The Principal Investigator is the first author of the report and was responsible for
preparing a report that will satisfy the NPS and the THC.
Curation
All artifacts and records generated by this project were submitted to TARL
for permanent curation.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
Prehistoric Sites
The survey of the Turkey Creek Unit in the Big Thicket National Preserve
located and recorded fifteen prehistoric sites and recovered artifacts from two
previously recorded sites. All of the artifacts were recovered through shovel
testing. The artifacts recovered from these sites include 3 Archaic projectile
points, 1 complete biface, 2 biface fragments, 7 pottery sherds, and 163 pieces
of debitage.
Each artifact was analyzed by coding for those individual and discreet
attributes common to each artifact type. The various components of the
projectile points (i.e., stem, blade, haft element, and overall size) were measured
and examined for specific technological traits. In addition, condition, material
type, and any presence of use modifications were recorded. Once the various
components were recorded, the projectile point type and age were established.
Similar analytical methods were employed for the bifaces with the addition of
establishing the reduction stage and/or a possible reason for abandonment.
Attributes of the projectile points and bifaces are presented in Appendix III.
Debitage is usually the most common artifact type recovered from
prehistoric sites. For this reason, and the fact that these materials can offer a
great deal of information on the activities conducted at a site, the flake debris is
closely analyzed. Each individual flake within the debitage assemblage was
coded for size, condition, type, presence/absence of heat, and material type. In
order to establish size, each flake was passed through a series of nested sieve
screens that range from 2 inches (size grade 1) to ¼ inch (size grade 7) with
those falling through the ¼ inch screen assigned a size grade 8. For general
purposes, the size of each flake reflects the stage of reduction; that is, large
flakes with some cortex are considered to represent initial or early stage
reduction, while smaller flakes without cortex are thought to represent late stage
reduction debris (Ahler 1975; Behm 1983:11-14; Newcomer 1971:88-90; Stahle
and Dunn 1982:85-94. Attributes of the flakes are presented in Appendix IV.
It must be understood, however, that flakes often break and that large
numbers of small flakes are also produced throughout the manufacturing
sequence as a result of edge straightening, platform creation, and other minor
manipulations necessary for successful flake removal. In addition, small flakes
are produced during maintenance (re-sharpening) tasks, use-related activities,
and the manufacture of small task specific tools, such as perforators, scrapers,
and a variety of cutting-type tools.

19

One other factor that explains the presence of small flakes is the size of
the tool produced. For example, arrow point manufacture during the Late
Prehistoric period, required smaller blanks or preforms than the larger dart points
common to earlier periods. Flakes produced from such blanks for arrow points
are smaller than comparable flakes produced during dart point manufacture.
However, many larger tools with large flake removals were also produced within
arrow point lithic assemblages; thus, any definitive reliance based strictly on flake
size for the separation of arrow point and dart point assemblages is not
recommended.
The other attributes, such as type of flake, raw material type, presence of
heating, and degree of heating of each flake all add to a better understanding of
those technological strategies and activities mentioned above. For example,
flake type (i.e., presence/absence of cortex) and hard or soft hammer removal
indicators help represent the reduction and removal sequences present. Material
typing is informative in understanding the presence or possible locations of
specific procurement areas that, in turn, can present a better picture of regional
prehistoric movements. The presence of heat (thermal alteration) can be a factor
of the manufacturing process, where some materials that resist flaking can be
altered to a form that is easier to flake (Dickens 1995). However, like most all
attributes studied, other factors may result in visual similarities. For example,
natural grass fires or the presence of hearths and earth ovens may also result in
heat alteration of materials that are not related to tool reduction and manufacture.
The pottery sherds were analyzed for the type of temper (materials added
to strengthen the clay) used and the treatment (smoothing, decorations, or slip)
present on the sherds’ surfaces. Type of temper is often used in determining age.
For example, sand and gritty clays are usually considered to be an early
attribute, while grog (fired ground pottery fragments or clay), shell, and bone
were used by later groups (Aten 1983:206-221; Shafer et al. 1975:18- 22; Rice
1987). Style (vessel form and surface treatment) is another means of placing
ceramics within specific time periods (Shafer et al. 1975:18); however, the sherds
recovered during this survey provide no indication of vessel form. Therefore this
factor cannot be used. The following is a description of artifacts recovered from
each site.

20

41HN16
Thirty-seven flakes and one pottery sherd were recovered from this site.
The flakes are small and include size grades 6 (n=2), 7 (n=17), and 8 (n=18).
They were found between levels 1 and 10. Twenty-one are complete, four are
proximal halves, and the rest are distal fragments. Seven are secondary flakes,
and the remainder is interior flakes. Some of the secondary flakes contain cortex
only on their platform edges. Twenty-two are made of unheated chert, 8 of
heated chert, 3 are quartzite, 2 are heated quartzite, and 2 are silicified wood. All
heating appears to be from natural grass fires and not as a result of purposeful
heating. The pottery sherd is a small plain fragment having a sandy paste
temper with a moderately coarse texture. It is firm and appears well fired. The
exterior surface is eroded but the other surface is smooth and appears
burnished. The Munsell color is 5YR 5/6 (yellowish-red) on the exterior and 5YR
4/1 (dark gray) on the interior.
41HN28
Seven flakes were recovered from this site. They range in size from size
grade 5 (n=1), 6 (n=1), 7 (n=3), and 8 (n=2). All are complete, and all but one
are interior flakes, with the exception being a secondary flake. Four are made of
unheated chert, 2 are heated chert, and 1 is of silicified wood. All heated flakes
appear to have been burned as a result of natural causes. A single flake was
found in every level between levels 1 and 10 with the exception of levels 2 and 9.
41HN43
A single interior flake and a projectile point were recovered from this site.
The flake is a size grade 7, is complete, and made from opal. This material is
milky white with a waxy-like surface and usually is very easy to flake if found in a
large enough form. It was probably produced by either soft hammer percussion
or pressure flaking
The projectile point is classified as a Woden (Figure 4), a little known dart
point type that occurs in the central portion of East Texas. This type is
associated with the Early Archaic. It was recovered from Level 8. This specimen
is characterized as being a crude or rough point with straight, convex, or
sometimes recurved blade edges that are sometimes asymmetrical. The
shoulders are rounded or squared, has a stem that is rectangular or slightly
contracting, and a base that is often not worked or covered with cortex (Turner
and Hester 1993:196).

21

Figure 4. Woden Projectile Point from 41HN43
This specimen has both of the tips of its shoulders and the extreme distal
tip missing. The tip damage is the result of impact, and the damaged shoulders
may have been a result of the same event. It is typical of the type and is made
from quartzite. Its measurements are 29.9 mm (with damage) long, 18.8 mm
wide, and 10.1 mm thick. It has been subjected to heat as evidenced by the red
color change present on all surfaces. This obviously occurred some time after
manufacture, probably after abandonment.
41HN44
Sixteen flakes, 1 projectile point tip, and 1 incised pottery sherd were
recovered from this site. The flake sizes include size grades 5 (n=1), 6 (n=4), 7
(n=8), and 8 (n=3). All are interior flake types, 7 are complete, 3 are the proximal
portions, and the remainder is distal fragments. Seven are made of unheated
chert, 5 are made of heated chert, 2 are made of quartzite, and 2 are made of
silicified wood. The flakes were found between levels 1 and 5 with the majority
(n=8) found in Level 1.
The biface fragment is the extreme distal tip and was found in Level 3. Its
shape suggests it may be the tip of a projectile point, and this observation is
further supported by the type of fracture that is consistent with impact type
fracture. It is made of unheated chert measuring 11.9 mm long, 10.2 mm wide,
and 4.8 mm thick.

22

The pottery sherd (Figure 5) is a small decorated sherd found in Level 2. It
has a sandy paste temper, a moderately coarse texture, but appears firm and
well fired. The exterior surface contains five incised parallel lines that were
etched onto the unfired surface one at a time, as indicated by the waviness of the
individual lines. The Munsell color of the exterior surface is 7.5YR 5/4 (brown)
and the interior is 7.5 YR 4/3 (brown).

Figure 5. Incised Pottery Sherd from site 41HN44.

41HN45
Ten flakes were found at this site. All are small and include size grades 6
(n=1), 7(4), and 8 (n=5) that were found between levels 1 and 9. Seven are
complete, two are proximal halves, and the remainder is a distal fragment. Six
are made from unheated chert, 2 are made from heated chert, 1 is made from
quartzite, and 1 is made from opalized silicified wood. The small size of these
specimens suggests that their removal was by either light percussion or pressure
flaking.
41HN46
Two flakes were found at this site. Both are size grade 7 and were found
in Level 2. They are complete interior flakes. One is made from unheated
quartzite, and the other is made from heated quartzite. Their small size suggests
their removal by light percussion or pressure flaking.

23

41HN47
Three flakes were recovered from this site, all from Level 1. All are size
grade 7, 2 are complete, and 1 is a distal fragment. Flake types include one
primary, one secondary, and one interior type. Two are of unheated chert, and
one is heated chert. The small sizes suggest removal by light percussion or
pressure flaking.
41HN48
Twenty-seven flakes, 1 biface fragment, 1 prehistoric sherd, and 1 historc
sherd were recovered from this site. The flake sizes include size grade 6 (n=3),
7 (n=14), and 8 (n=10) and were found between levels 1 and 9. Sixteen are
complete, four are proximal halves, and the rest are distal fragments. All are the
interior flake type with 13 made of unheated chert, 8 of heated chert, and 6 of
silicified wood. The small sizes suggest removal by light percussion or pressure
flaking.
The biface is the proximal end of either a narrow biface or the stem of a
projectile point that was found in Level 9. It measures 20.8 mm long, 14.6 mm
wide, and 7.7 mm thick. It is made of silicified wood. Some of the original
surface of the raw material remains suggesting it may not be from a finished tool.
However, the surface of silicified wood does not contain cortex, nor does the
surface weather to a point that inhibits flaking, therefore the presence of some of
the original surface may not indicate whether or not the piece was finished.
The pottery sherds are both small. One was found in Level 6, and the
other was found in Level 9. The specimen from Level 6 is plain, has a sandy
paste temper, a coarse "layered" texture, appears poorly fired and "crumbly," and
has an eroded surface. The Munsell color is 10YR 6/8 (brownish-yellow) for the
exterior and 10YR 3/6 (dark yellowish-brown) for the interior side. The other
sherd is also plain with a sandy paste temper, a coarse texture, is firm and
appears well fired. Its Munsell color is 5YR 4/3 (reddish-brown) for both
surfaces. The interior surface contains some light "brush" marks applied prior to
firing. These probably indicate interior treatment and preparation of the surface
before final firing.
41HN49
Two flakes and one pottery sherd were recovered from this site. Both
flakes are size grade 8 and found in levels 5 and 8. They are complete, interior
flakes, with one made of unheated chert and the other of opal. Their small size
suggests removal by light percussion or pressure flakes. The pottery sherd is
plain, has a temper that resembles grog, a coarse texture, but is firm and
appears to be well fired. It's Munsell color is 5YR 4/3 (reddish-brown) for the
exterior and 7.5YR 4/3 (brown) for the interior.

24

41HN50
Three flakes were found at this site. These include two that are size grade
7 and one that is size grade 8. They were found in levels 1, 3, and 8. All are
complete and are the interior flakes. Two are made from unheated chert, and
one is made from heated chert. Their small size suggests they were removed by
light percussion or pressure flaking.
41TL79
Four flakes and one projectile point were recovered. Sizes of the flakes
range from size grade 5 (< 3/4 inch and > 1/2 inch) to size grade 8 (< 1/4 inch),
which comprises 50 percent of the total. The largest (size grade 5) was a hard
hammer flake (removed by a hard hammerstone), while the remaining flakes
were removed by light percussion or pressure flaking. All are interior flakes with
no cortex present. Two are complete, two are fragmented, and all are made of
unheated chert. They were recovered from levels 3 (20-30 cm) to 9 (80-90 cm).
The projectile point is a dart point identified as a Kent type recovered from
Level 5 (40-50 cm). It is almost complete with only the extreme basal edge
missing. Kent points often contain unmodified bases, but the broken basal edge
on this specimen probably occurred while hafted (mounted in a handle or shaft).
These points are characterized by having asymmetrical triangular blades and
weak shoulders. Often they are parallel sided and have contracting stems with
convex to straight basal edges that are sometimes not chipped or covered with
cortex. Kent points date from the Middle Archaic to the Late or Transitional
Archaic, circa 2000 B.C.- A.D.500 (Suhm and Jelks 1962:199-200; Turner and
Hester 1993:136).
This specimen (Figure 6) is typical of the type, being crudely flaked on
both the blade and stem portions. It has a long triangular blade and a parallelsided stem. It is made of silicified wood and is 53.8 mm long (with base
damage), 24.3 mm wide, and 18.1 mm thick.

41TL80
Three flakes were recovered from this site. They are small (size grades 7
(n=1) and 8 (n=2), and all are interior types. Two are complete, 1 is fragmented,
2 are made of unheated chert, and 1 is of silicified wood, also unheated. They
were all made by either light percussion or pressure flaking. One was found in
each of the following levels - 5, 7, and 9.
41TL81
Two flakes were recovered from this site. They are small (size grades 6
and 7). One is broken, and the other is complete. Both are interior types made
of unheated chert. They were produced either by light percussion (using little
force) or soft hammer and were recovered in levels 1 (0-10 cm) and 2 (10-20
cm).
41TL82
Fourteen flakes and two pottery sherds were recovered from this site. The
flakes are all small, size grades 6 (n=1), 7 (n=5), and 8 (n=7). Nine are complete,
and all but one are interior flakes. The single exception is a secondary flake
having cortex on the platform edge. Six flakes are of unheated chert, 5 have
been heated, 1 is quartzite, and 2 are heated quartzite. None of this heating
appears purposeful. All appear to have been made by either light percussion or
pressure flaking. They were found primarily between levels 1 and 5 with a single
flake from Level 9. Most were found in levels 2-4.

26

Both sherds are plain, have a sandy paste temper, a texture that is fine,
firm, and appears to be well fired. Their surfaces (both interior and exterior) are
smooth with a Munsell color of 7.5YR 3/1 (very dark brown) for the exterior and
7.5YR 3/ 4 (very dark brown) for their interior. Both were found in the same
shovel test at Level 5.
41TL83
Two flakes were recovered from this site. Both small are small (size
grades 7 and 8) both are complete, and both are and interior types. One is made
of unheated chert, and the other is heated quartzite. They were produced by
either light percussion or pressure flaking and were recovered in levels 1 and 7.
41TL84
Six flakes were recovered from this site. They are all small, being equally
divided between size grades 7 and 8. Three are complete. Two are proximal
halves, and one is a distal fragment. Flake types include one primary and five
interior types, and all are made of unheated chert. Their small size and platform
types suggest their removal by either light percussion or pressure flaking. They
were all found between levels 1 and 7.
41TL85
Twenty-one 21 flakes, 1 Ellis projectile point, and 1 complete biface were
recovered from this site. Flake sizes range from 5 (n=4), 6 (n=2), 7 (n=7), and 8
(n=8). All are interior flakes. Eleven are complete, four are proximal halves, and
the rest are distal fragments. Materials include 17 made of unheated chert, 2 of
heated chert, and 2 of silicified wood. The small size and platform types indicate
that they were removed either by light percussion or pressure flaking. They were
found between levels 1 and 8.
The projectile point is classified as an Ellis type (Figure 7). This dart point
type is described as a crudely flaked point having a short, thick body with
prominent well barbed shoulders, a stem that is slightly expanding, and a basal
edge that is straight to slightly convex (Suhm and Jelks 1962:187-188; Turner
and Hester 1993:113). They date from the Middle Archaic to the Transitional
Archaic (1000 B.C.-500-1000 A.D.).

Figure 7. Ellis Projectile Point from 41TL85
This specimen varies from typical Ellis points in that the stem expands
only very slightly. Other than that it is typical of the type. One shoulder and a
portion of the adjoining lateral edge are missing. It is small and measures 34.8
mm long, 20.8 mm wide (with damage), and 5.8 mm thick. It is made of silicified
wood. Interestingly, portions of one surface are heavily smoothed. This
smoothing may be from extensive handling or "bag wear,” but it is most likely that
it was present before the point was made.
The biface is a complete specimen found in Level 7 (Figure 8). It is made
of chert and measures 50.1 mm long, 19.4 mm wide, and 12.0 mm thick. Flaking
is a crude percussion type with remnants of cortex remaining on both surfaces.
Its color is red, but this appears to be the natural color and not a result of heating.
It is an interesting specimen in that it is almost bi-pointed and is strongly twisted
that begins approximately mid-length. This suggests that it was intended for a
tool other than a projectile point. The edges, however, are still sharp and show
no wear. Its crude shape and presence of cortex indicate that it probably was
never finished or used.

Discussion
The paucity of artifacts and artifact types recovered from the seventeen
sites indicates that these sites are probably short-term occupation sites, probably
occupied seasonally. The debitage comprises mostly small interior flakes with no
intensive tool manufacture indicated at any of the sites (i.e. large reduction
flakes, failed bifaces). Some flakes were noted as having cortex on the platform
edges. One explanation for this is that they are a result of the reduction of
globular cores (Davis and Tomka 1987:143). However, a more likely answer is
that the utilization of small chert cobbles requires a careful and conserved
reduction strategy. Tool sizes are always dependant upon raw material size (i.e.,
the smaller the piece of raw material the smaller the tool).
When reducing small cobbles, length is often a more important factor than
width; thus, initial cortex removal and flaking were often initiated from the long
axis, often leaving cortex on the lateral edges of the blank. Thus, flakes were not
removed consistently from the lateral edges until later in the reduction stage.
Flakes removed at this time would often retain cortex (Dickens 1993:133-134).
The fragmented bifaces recovered appear to be parts of finished tools
rather than tools broken during manufacture. The one complete specimen
(Figure 6), although rough and "twisted," may have been finished and intended
for use in a specific task. However, it should be stressed that lithic material
resources are few in that region, and any suitable lithic material (including broken
tools) would be regarded as important and considered valuable. Thus, some
used up tools and tool fragments may have been saved to be used in other tasks
as needed.
The size of the debitage is small. These small flakes are typical of re­
juvenation type flaking such as re-sharpening or repairing of dulled or damaged
projectile points, knives, scrapers, and other tools. The projectile points
recovered are all damaged and may have been discarded in favor of complete
ones as part of the re-juvenation process. The dates established for two of the
projectile points (Ellis and Kent) center between the Middle to Transitional
Archaic (2000 B.C. - A.D. 700). The Kent point (along with Gary points) typifies
the Middle to Late Archaic and possibly the Transitional Archaic of East Texas.
That is, they are typical points within lithic assemblages for that time period
(Turner and Hester 1993:60, 67).
The Woden point has been assigned an Early Archaic date; however, little
information is available on this point type, and it's validity as a type may be in
question. Considering the context of the sites tested, an Early Archaic date may
be incorrect. The other factor surrounding this point is that it may have been
incorrectly identified. This is possible as small Elam and Gary points are similar,
and this specimen has suffered some damage, which could alter it enough to be
appear as a different type.

29

Ceramics first appeared during the late Transitional Archaic with the Early
Ceramic period being firmly established by A.D. 400 (Turner and Hester
1993:60). The few pottery sherds encountered are not surprising as ceramics
are easily broken and often litter most any site where they were present. At
longer occupation sites, pottery sherds are often encountered in the hundreds.
Thus, these observations and findings indicate that the sites surveyed in the
project were occupied during the Middle to Transitional Archaic only for short
periods of time as a base during procurement activities, for shelter during
regional movements, or for re-tooling and/ or re-furbishing of existing tools and
equipment.
Of course, these findings are all based on shovel testing and may not
reflect the true nature of some sites. The artifact densities of some sites (i.e.,
41HN16, 41HN44, 41HN48, 41TL82, 41TL85) indicate that occupational debris
may be more concentrated than the recoveries showed. This, however, is true
for any such testing dependant on shovel tests and is not unique to this survey.
Historic Artifacts
Three historic sherds were observed on the surface of site 41HN28. Two
are decorated and appear to be hand-painted. They were joined to fit as one.
According to Roger G. Moore (based on a digital photograph of the sherd), it
dates to sometime between 1890 and 1950. The single undecorated sherd is
whiteware and dates to the 20th century.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Three objectives guided the archeological investigations during the course
of this project. They were (1) to locate and identify cultural resources (prehistoric
and historic) within the project area, (2) to assess sites in terms of their potential
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, and (3) to provide avoidance
measures for all sites recorded as a result of this survey
Archival Research
The archival research revealed that six archeological surveys and two
other studies regarding past work in the project area have been conducted by
professional archeologists. This task identified six previously recorded sites in
the project area (41HN14, 41HN16, 41HN17, 41HN25, 41HN28, and 41TL59).
Two of these sites (41HN14 and 41HN16) are prehistoric, three are historic
(41HN17, 41HN25, and 41TL59), and one (41HN28) contains prehistoric and
historic components. See the Archeological Background section above for more
information regarding past work in the project area.
Field Survey
The field survey encountered thick woods containing mixed hardwoods
and pines as well as various species of understory. This portion of the forest
contains deeply incised streams and steep hills with elevations ranging from 125
feet to 140 feet above mean sea level. Also, there are a number of seep springs
that feed the various creeks.
This survey located and recorded fifteen new prehistoric archeological
sites. Only eight prehistoric sites were able to be dated based on the presence
of diagnostic artifacts. The age of those sites with no diagnostic artifacts are
referred to in this report as “Unknown Prehistoric.” Three sites date to the
Archaic period based on the presence of dart points, and five sites date to the
Late Prehistoric period based on the presence of ceramics. The following
section presents a description of each site including type, age, geographical
location, distance to nearest water, name of relevant topographic map, number of
shovel tests (positive and negative), elevation, soil type, percent of ground cover
and disturbance, artifacts recovered, and temporary field number. In addition, a
statement regarding the potential of each site for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places is presented as well as the potential effect on each by the
seismic survey. Each site discussion is followed by a site map that depicts the
positive and negative shovel tests, features (if present), and landmarks such as
roads and creeks. Each map was drawn to scale from the topographic
quadrangle and has a north arrow. The six previously recorded sites were visited
and flagged for avoidance. Shovel testing revealed a prehistoric component at
site 41HN28, a previously recorded historic site.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
41HN14
This previously recorded prehistoric site is in Hardin County. Andy Kyle
collected points from this site sometime between 1946 and 1986. Most of his
collection is on display at the Sam Houston Regional Library and Research
Center in Liberty, Texas. The Kyle collection was cataloged and assessed by
Houston Archeological Society members Sheldon M. Kindall and Leland W.
Patterson during a summer project in 1986. Very little is known about this site,
as the article by Kindall and Patterson (1986) does not give site numbers. As a
result, the artifact types described in their article cannot be correlated with
41HN14. It is described on the site form as a prehistoric Indian campsite.
According to Kindall, all of the Andy Kyle sites need to be investigated. This site
was visited during this survey and flagged for avoidance. This site is on the
Village Mills topographic quadrangle. This site has unknown eligibility for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places pending further work. No site map
was prepared because shovel testing was not conducted.

33

41HN16
This previously recorded prehistoric site is in Hardin County and consists
of 37 flakes and 1 sherd found during shovel testing. It is located on the high
ground near the confluence of Hickory Creek and Village Creek at an elevation of
66 feet above mean sea level. Village Creek is the nearest water source and is
158 meters to the south. The map with shovel test locations appears below
(Figure 9). At the time of this survey, the ground cover was 90 percent and
consisted of a pine forest and mixed hardwoods. The soil in the area has been
identified as Belrose-Caneyhead complex, 0 to 1 percent slopes, and disturbance
was estimated to be between 10 and 20 percent. Thirty-one shovel tests were
excavated at the site, and 20 were positive. The size of this site is estimated at
3500 square meters, and it is classified as an unknown prehistoric site dating to
the Late Prehistoric period of Texas prehistory. It is believed to possess research
potential because of the large number of artifacts (including one diagnostic
sherd) when compared to the other sites found during this survey. Also, these
artifacts were found at most levels to a depth of 90 cm. This site will be avoided;
therefore, it will not be affected. An abandoned oil well pad lies to the northeast
adjacent to the site. The temporary number assigned in the field is WK-05. This
site is depicted on the Kountze North topographic quadrangle. This site has
unknown eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places pending
further work.
Comments:
When Heartfield, Price & Greene, Inc. (HPG) recorded site 41HN16 in 1988, their
project area was limited to the proposed well pad site. The area they surveyed
was destroyed when the well was constructed. This area is adjacent to our
subsurface findings. They did not survey outside the proposed well pad, but they
noted in their report that the site may extend in the direction of the creek. Our
survey indicated they had incorrectly plotted the well site. Shovel testing by HPG
archeologists recovered one Perdiz arrow point and two flakes.

41HN17
This previously recorded historic site is in Hardin County. It was recorded
as a farmstead by Treat and Dethloff (1978) in 1974 and revisited by Moore
Archeological Consulting in 1997. At the time of the second visit, the site
consisted of a single residential cabin. An intensive surface inspection was
conducted in parallel and random transects around the area of the cabin, and the
site was mapped using a compass and tape along with pacing. Ten shovel tests
at intervals of 20 meters were dug in the area around the cabin. They
documented their work with maps, drawings, photographs, a daily journal, and
shovel test records. This site, referred to as the Staley cabin, is on a landform
100 feet above mean sea level at the intersection of the top and side slope of a
ridge. The soil at this site is identified on the site form as Kirbyville fine sandy
loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes. The nearest natural water is Village Creek 950
meters to the north and northeast. The major drainage in the vicinity is the
Neches River. This site was revisited by BVRA and found to be in the same
condition. The cabin was still standing, and its interior had been modified for use
by the park service as a visitor center. Historic documents indicate this site dates
to the early to middle 20th century. According to the site form, “this site reflects
patterns of early to middle 20th century homesteading in Southeast Texas,
especially the adaptation and survival of low-income families during the Great
Depression.” Additional research was recommended if future impacts threaten
this site. No shovel tests were excavated at 41HN17 by BVRA, and no site map
was made. It is on the Kountze North topographic quadrangle. This site has
unknown eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places pending
further work.

36

41HN25
This previously recorded historic site is in Hardin County. It was recorded
by Treat and Dethloff (1978) as a historic cabin in 1974. The name of the owner
is not stated on the site form. The nearest natural water is a small unnamed
tributary of Turkey Creek. At the time of their visit it sat on the edge of an upland
flat overlooking the east bank of Turkey Creek about 55 feet below the cabin.
The site is adjacent to a small drainage that appeared to the researchers to come
from a sizable swamp or pond down slope from Turkey Creek. Treat and
Dethloff described the cabin as dating to the 1930s or 1940s. The roof had a tin
roof, clapboard or tongue-and-groove siding, and sat on wooden piers. No
chimney was present. Its condition was considered to be excellent in 1974.
There was a problem in transposing the plotting of this site from the 15’ Warren
topographic quadrangle to the 7.5’ Hicksbaugh topographic quadrangle by Moore
Archeological Consulting when they conducted their inventory of the Big Thicket
in 1974 and 1975. They state that it is unlikely that the site lies on the steep
slope, so they plotted it on the top of the slope. They were also not sure if the
cabin was on the north side or south side of the small drainage. They
recommended a revisit for mapping and photography. This site was visited
during the current survey. We found a historic site in the described location, but
no cab in or other standing structures were present. A cabin was observed in the
vicinity, but outside the boundaries of the Big Thicket National Preserve.
Therefore, we speculated that this may be the cabin in question (41HN25), and
we assumed it was moved prior to the acquisition of the land by the Big Thicket
National Preserve. No shovel testing was conducted, and no map was made.
The site area was flagged for avoidance by seismic operations. This site is on
the Hicksbaugh topographic quadrangle. This site has unknown eligibility for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places pending further work.

37

41HN28
This previously recorded multi-component site is in Hardin County. A
prehistoric component, consisting of seven flakes was found during shovel
testing by BVRA during a revisit to this site. It is located on a raised landform at
an elevation of 65 feet above mean sea level overlooking Village Creek 87
meters to the southwest. Figures 10 and 11 depict the location of all shovel tests
at the site. At the time of this survey, the ground cover was 90 percent and
consisted of a pine forest with mixed hardwoods. The soil in the area has been
identified as Votaw fine sand, 0 to 1 percent slopes, and disturbance was
estimated to be 20 percent. Eighteen shovel tests were excavated within the
prehistoric and historic components at the site, and seven were positive. The
size of this site (both components) is estimated at 5000 square meters. The
prehistoric component is classified as an unknown prehistoric site, and the
historic is classified as a probable hunting camp. Historic artifacts were observed
on the surface, but they were not collected. During the visit by BVRA, the cabin
was found to be collapsed. This site will be avoided; therefore, it will not be
affected. The temporary number assigned in the field is KU-06. This site is
depicted on the Kountze North topographic quadrangle. The prehistoric
component contains few artifacts, and the historic component was found to be in
poor condition. This site is not eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places.
Comments:
This site was originally recorded by Treat and Dethloff (1978) in 1974 as a
historic hunting camp, and it was assigned the trinomial 41HN28. The original
recorders did not conduct shovel tests; therefore, the prehistoric component was
not detected. This location of this site was incorrectly plotted on the TARL maps,
which led to its being shovel tested at a proposed source point location. The
plotted location was revisited, and no sign of a collapsed hunting camp was
observed. The original historic descriptions match what was found at the new
location. The low number of artifacts recovered from this site indicates that the
prehistoric component probably functioned as a short-term occupation site that
was occupied seasonally. The debitage recovered by Treat and Dethloff
consisted of two small interior flakes with no intensive tool manufacture indicated.
The age of the prehistoric component is unknown based on an absence of
diagnostic artifacts. The age of the historic component dates to the 20th century.
Historic features include a collapsed hunting cabin, fence posts, a wire fence, a
trash dump, and a section of an old road depression. Artifacts observed on the
surface but not collected include tin cans, stove pipe sections, 1 copper cooking
pot with a strap handle, 1960s metal beer cans, green glass, bricks, metal
buckets, fuse box, three historic sherds, and scattered tin. Two of the historic
sherds were joined into one sherd. This sherd may be hand-painted, but it dates
to sometime between 1890 and 1950. The single undecorated sherd is
whiteware and dates to the 20th century.

This prehistoric site is in Hardin County and consists of 1 flake and 1
Woden dart point made of silicified wood, found during shovel testing. It is
located on a the eastern end of an east-west trending landform at an elevation of
80 feet above mean sea level overlooking Village Creek 734 meters to the
northeast. The map with shovel test locations appears below (Figure 12). At the
time of this survey, the ground cover was 90 percent and consisted of a pine
forest with mixed hardwoods. The soil in the area has been identified as Otanya
fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, and disturbance was estimated to be
between 10 and 20 percent. Eleven shovel tests were excavated at the site, and
two were positive. The size of this site is estimated at 300 square meters, and it
is classified as an unknown prehistoric site dating to the Archaic period of Texas
prehistory. This site is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places because of a paucity of artifacts and no features observed. This site will
be avoided; therefore, it will not be affected. The temporary number assigned in
the field is CS-03. This site is depicted on the Kountze North topographic
quadrangle.
Comments:
The low number of artifacts recovered from this site indicates that it probably
functioned as a short-term occupation site that was occupied seasonally. The
presence of the Woden dart point is an indicator of an Archaic occupation.

41HN44
This prehistoric site is in Hardin County and consists of 16 flakes, 1 biface
tip, and 1 sherd found during shovel testing. It is located on a small raised
landform at an elevation of 66 feet above mean sea level overlooking Village
Creek 147 meters to the south. The map with shovel test locations appears
below (Figure 13). At the time of this survey, the ground cover was 90 percent
and consisted of a pine forest with mixed hardwoods. The soil in the area has
been identified as Votaw fine sand, 0 to 1 percent slopes, and disturbance was
estimated to be between 10 and 20 percent. Twelve shovel tests were
excavated at the site, and four were positive. The size of this site is estimated at
600 square meters, and it is classified as an unknown prehistoric site dating to
the Late Prehistoric period. It is believed to possess research potential because
of the large number of artifacts (including one diagnostic sherd and one biface)
when compared to the other sites found during this survey. Also, these artifacts
were found at most levels to a depth of between 90 and 100 cm. In addition, the
site appears to be between 80 and 90 percent intact. This site will be avoided;
therefore, it will not be affected. The temporary number assigned in the field is
KU-05. This site is depicted on the Kountze North topographic quadrangle. This
site has unknown eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
pending further work.
Comments:
The debitage consists of small, interior flakes with no evidence of extensive tool
manufacture. No features were observed that would be an indication of a more
permanent occupation. The exterior of the sherd is decorated with five parallel
incised lines that were etched onto the unfired surface. It has a sandy paste
temper and a moderately coarse temper. It appears to have been well fired. An
abandoned channel of Village Creek lies just south of the site. Two old logging
roads were observed to the east and west of the site.

This prehistoric site is in Hardin County and consists of 10 flakes found
during shovel testing. It is located on a gradual slope at an elevation of 66 feet
above mean sea level overlooking Village Creek 438 meters to the north. The
map with shovel test locations appears below (Figure 14). At the time of this
survey, the ground cover was 90 percent and consisted of a pine forest with
mixed hardwoods. The soil in the area has been identified as Belrose loamy very
fine sand, 1 to 3 percent slopes, and disturbance was estimated to be between
10 and 20 percent. Seventeen shovel tests were excavated at the site, and eight
were positive. The size of this site is estimated at 1600 square meters, and it is
classified as an unknown prehistoric site. This site will be avoided; therefore, it
will not be affected. The temporary number assigned in the field is PB-01. This
site is depicted on the Kountze North topographic quadrangle. This site has
unknown eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places pending
further work.
Comments:
The low number of artifacts recovered from this site indicates that the prehistoric
component probably functioned as a short-term occupation site that was

This prehistoric site is in Hardin County and consists of two flakes found in
a single shovel test. It is located on a broad flat area at an elevation of 66 feet
above mean sea level overlooking Village Creek 477 meters to the south. The
map with shovel test locations appears below (Figure 15). At the time of this
survey, the ground cover was 90 percent and consisted of a pine forest with
mixed hardwoods. The soil in the area has been identified as Votaw fine sand, 0
to 1 percent slopes, and disturbance was estimated to be between 10 and 20
percent. Nine shovel tests were excavated at the site, and one was positive.
The size of this site is limited to the single positive shovel test, and it is classified
as an unknown prehistoric site, possibly a single knapping event. This site is not
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places because of a paucity
of artifacts and no features observed. This site will be avoided; therefore, it will
not be affected. The temporary number assigned in the field is PB-02. This site
is depicted on the Kountze North topographic quadrangle.

This multi-component site is in Hardin County. The prehistoric component
consists of 27 flakes and 1 biface fragment found during shovel testing. The
historic component consists of a collapsed small structure that is now a pile of
rubble. Artifacts observed include sections of tin stove pipe, cypress planks,
roofing tin, composition asphalt shingles, metal eaves trim, tar paper, and
window glass. One ceramic whiteware sherd and one wire nail were found
during shovel testing. This site is located on a the high bank above the creek at
an elevation of 64 feet above mean sea level overlooking Village Creek 30
meters to the north. The map with shovel test locations appears below (Figure
17). At the time of this survey, the ground cover was 90 percent and consisted of
a pine forest and mixed hardwoods. The soil in the area has been identified as
Lulus-Bleakwood complex, 0 to 1 percent slopes, frequently flooded, and
disturbance of the prehistoric component was estimated to be between 10 and
20 percent. Twenty shovel tests were excavated at the site, and 14 were
positive. The size of this site is estimated at 8000 square meters. The
prehistoric component is classified as an unknown prehistoric site dating to the
Late Prehistoric period of Texas prehistory, and the historic component is
classified as a probable hunting camp dating to the 20th century. Also, these
artifacts were found at most levels to a depth of 100 cm. The historic component
is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places because of its
disturbed condition and recent age. This site will be avoided; therefore, it will not
be affected. The temporary number assigned in the field is WK-04. This site is
depicted on the Kountze North topographic quadrangle. The prehistoric
component has unknown eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places because of the large number of artifacts recovered (including one
diagnostic sherd) when compared to the other sites found during this survey.
Also, these artifacts were found at most levels to a depth of 100 cm.
Comments:
The historic component is believed to represent a fenced recreational or hunting
camp within the former Sternenberg Preserve. If this site had been occupied on
a more permanent basis more domestic artifacts should be present. At one time
there was a series of steps that led from the structure to the river. These steps
were made from cypress planks nailed to creosoted ties with modern wire nails.
These steps were destroyed by the National Park Service for safety reasons.

This prehistoric site is in Hardin County and consists of 2 flakes and 1
sherd found during shovel testing. It is located on an east-west trending ridge at
an elevation of 71 feet above mean sea level overlooking Village Creek 277
meters to the northeast. The map with shovel test locations appears below
(Figure 18). At the time of this survey, the ground cover was 90 percent and
consisted of a pine forest and mixed hardwoods. The soil in the area has been
identified as Belrose loamy very fine sand, 1 to 3 percent slopes, and disturbance
was estimated to be 50 percent due to logging activities. Thirty-one shovel tests
were excavated at the site, and eight were positive. The size of this site is
estimated at 3500 square meters. This site is classified as an unknown
prehistoric site dating to the Late Prehistoric period of Texas prehistory. This site
will be avoided; therefore, it will not be affected. The temporary number
assigned in the field is WK-06. This site is depicted on the Village Mills
topographic quadrangle. This site has unknown eligibility for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places pending further work.
Comments:
The low number of artifacts recovered from this site indicates that the prehistoric
component probably functioned as a short-term occupation site that was
occupied seasonally. The debitage consists of two small interior flakes with no
intensive tool manufacture indicated. The age of this site is unknown based on
an absence of diagnostic artifacts

This previously recorded historic site is in Tyler County. It was originally
recorded as a historic house by Treat and Dethloff (1978) in 1974. The nearest
natural water is Turkey Creek. According to the site form, it sits atop a “west­
thrusting lobe” nearly 100 feet above the Turkey Creek floodplain. Treat and
Dethloff describe it as being made of board and batten construction from heartof-pine lumber. The front of the roof was covered with wood shingles. It was the
traditional “L” shape with a dog trot. A chimney made of mud daub was present
in 1974, and it was in good condition. No cut nails were observed in the
structure. The house sat on wedge-shaped cypress piers. According to local
informants, this house was about 100 years old in 1974. At the time of the visit
by Treat and Dethloff, it was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. King. The original owners
of the house were the Richardsons.
It was viewed by Treat and Dethloff as a classic example of a pioneer
dwelling, and they state that it should be restored. This site was visited during the
current survey, and no sign of the cabin or a collapsed cabin was found
Scattered historic habitation debris, however, was found at and near the mapped
location of this site. There is an early house across the road, which may be the
relocated Richardson house. No shovel tests were excavated, and no map was
made. The site area was flagged for avoidance by seismic operations. This site
is on the Hicksbaugh topographic quadrangle. This site has unknown eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places pending further work.

Summary
During the current survey, archaeologists identified the presence of
prehistoric and historic sites. Based on diagnostic artifacts (projectile points and
pottery), the prehistoric sites date to the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods of
Texas prehistory. Most of the sites, however, lacked diagnostic artifacts and
could not be assigned to a specific time period. In general, artifacts at the
prehistoric sites in good context were few in number. A few sites, however,
contained greater numbers, and it is those sites that have been recommended as
possessing unknown eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places. All of the prehistoric sites were found on landforms containing sandy
soils in close proximity to a stream. No artifacts at the prehistoric sites were
observed on the surface – all sites were found through shovel testing. The sites
ranged in depth from 10 centimeters to 100 centimeters. No features such as
hearths were observed; therefore, it cannot be stated in this report that any of the
prehistoric sites were camps where food was prepared and consumed.
The historic sites consist of standing structures and the areas where such
structures once stood. These sites date to the 20th century and represent the
former location of farmsteads and hunting or recreational camps. Although
lumbering was a major industry in the Big Thicket during the timber boom, no
evidence of trams was found. The major railroad lines that transported lumber to
the sawmills were located outside the current project area; therefore, no
evidence of these lines was observed. As stated above, trams were often short
in length and temporary in nature. Therefore, it is possible that some were
constructed in the project area, but they left behind no evidence such as cuts and
fills. At least, this was not observed by the survey crew. Numerous old road
depressions were observed, some of which could have been old tram lines that
were recycled as later logging or domestic roads. Past logging ground
disturbance was observed on the surface and in shovel tests. The first 30 cm
(or more) was soil that had been churned or disturbed, and the surface in many
places was very rough. This was viewed as an indication of log skidding areas.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The following measures will be incorporated into the project design for the
protection of cultural resources. At any time that operations result in ground
disturbance exceeding two inches below the surface in areas of high probability
for discovery of archeological resources, operations will be re-routed or will
cease until a qualified archeologist is onsite to monitor the ground-disturbing
activities. As defined by the National Park Service, areas of high probability for
discovery of archeological resources include (1) elevated ridge tops (2) flat
benches overlooking the lower upland flats (3) all sand mounds (pimple mounds,
especially those of three or more feet in relief within areas of seasonal
inundation, (4) all high ground adjacent to major drainage flood zones (typically
40 or more feet above mean sea level), and (5) slopes and ridges in close
proximity (100 meters) to permanent water sources. Seismic Assistants Ltd. will
immediately bring to the attention of the Superintendent any cultural or scientific
resource encountered that might be altered or destroyed by the operation and
will leave such discovery intact until told to proceed by the Superintendent. The
Superintendent will evaluate the discoveries, and will determine within 10
working days what action will be taken with respect to such discoveries. GPS
measurements in NAD 83 datum of any newly discovered sites will be recorded
and provided to the National Park Service in the daily compliance report
Since the seismic survey will avoid all known archeological sites within the
current project area, no recommendations regarding further work are needed. If,
however, evidence of an archeological site is encountered during monitoring of
the drilling the find will be reported, evaluated, and avoided.
