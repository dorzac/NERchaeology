MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This report documents the removal of individuals buried within Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery
(41GV171) to avoid potential impact to the remains during implementation of remediation
activities at the Malone Service Company Superfund Site (Site) in Texas City, TX. An oil recovery
and waste processing facility had operated at the Site for more than 30 years, ending in the mid­
1990s. The facility had stored, processed, and disposed of industrial solid wastes and hazardous
wastes. In July 2012, a group of companies known as the Malone Cooperating Parties (MCP)
entered into a Consent Decree with the U.S. Government, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, and the State of Texas to implement a remedial design and remedial action at the Site. It
was determined that if the remains in the cemetery were not relocated, there was the potential that
remediation activities could impact the cemetery. Archival research, review of historic maps and
aerial photographs, and reconnaissance survey revealed the extent of potential remains at the
cemetery, and, given the location of the cemetery and the scope of the planned remediation
activities, it was deemed impractical for the environmental remediation contractors to work around
the cemetery. (41GV171). The MCP consulted with EPA, Campbell family descendants, the
Galveston County Historical Commission, and the Texas Historical Commission and developed a
plan to relocate the remains to a perpetual care cemetery in accordance with Texas state law and
associated rules and procedures.
In accordance with Texas Health and Safety Code §711.004, the landowner Land Navigator, Ltd.,
on behalf of the MCP, petitioned the Galveston County Judicial District Court for removal of the
dedication of the cemetery and the transfer of the human remains to the perpetual care cemetery
operated by Forest Park East Funeral Home and Cemetery (FPE), 21620 Gulf Freeway, Webster,
TX 77598. On February 11, 2014, Land Navigator was granted a Summary Judgment allowing
Land Navigator to disinter and relocate the remains to FPE.
Versar, Inc. (formerly Geo-Marine, Inc.), on behalf of the MCP, provided all archeological and
human osteological expertise for the disinterment and analysis of the human remains. Disinterment
permits from the State Registrar of the Vital Statistics Unit of the Department of State Health
Services, as required by Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 22 (Texas Historical
Commission, Cemeteries), were obtained for each burial.
The disinterment excavations at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery revealed 34 burials from which 35
individuals were excavated. No graves were marked by headstones. It is the professional judgment
of Versar that, of the 35 individual sets of remains identified, 11 were determined to be adults (5
male and 3 female; 3 of indeterminate sex), and 24 were determined to be children. The majority
of children at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery (n=18) are under 5 years of age and six are premature
infants aged 30–40 weeks.
Burials could not be associated conclusively with any individuals identified by the descendants;
however, the combination of bioarcheological analysis, coffin hardware analysis, census data, and
descendant identifications resulted in a list of individuals that may have been interred in certain
graves. Some of the interments include James and Mary Campbell, Charlie Meyers, Benjamin
Ninnie Dick, Phoebe Rutlage, and Shelby McNeil, Jr. Children were difficult to identify; however,
there is good potential the graves of Frank Campbell, Mary Jane Campbell, Charles Munson, and
Grace Dick were identified. Data are conclusive that the children Levi and Joseph (Joe) Parr were
both interred together in Burial 6, the concrete crypt with brick covering. Grace Dick was the last
individual interred at the cemetery in 1904.

INTRODUCTION
This report documents the removal of individuals buried in Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery
(41GV171) to avoid potential impact to the remains during implementation of remediation
activities at the Malone Service Company Superfund Site (Site) in Texas City, Texas. An oil
recovery and waste processing facility had operated at the Site for more than 30 years, ending in
the mid-1990s. The facility was used to store, process, and dispose of industrial solid wastes and
hazardous wastes. In July 2012, a group of companies known as the Malone Cooperating Parties
(MCP) entered into a Consent Decree with the U.S. Government, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, and the State of Texas to implement a remedial design and remedial action at
the Site. It was determined that if the remains in the cemetery were not relocated, there was the
potential that remediation activities could impact the cemetery. Archival research, review of
historic maps and aerial photographs, and reconnaissance survey revealed the extent of potential
remains at the cemetery, and, given the location of the cemetery and the scope of the planned
remediation activities, it was deemed impractical for the environmental remediation contractors to
work around the cemetery. The MCP consulted with EPA, Campbell family descendants, the
Galveston County Historical Commission, and the Texas Historical Commission and developed a
plan to relocate the remains to a perpetual care cemetery in accordance with Texas state law and
associated rules and procedures.
In accordance with Texas Health and Safety Code §711.004, the landowner Land Navigator, Ltd.,
on behalf of the MCP, petitioned the Galveston County Judicial District Court for removal of the
dedication of the cemetery and the transfer of the human remains to the perpetual care cemetery
operated by Forest Park East Funeral Home and Cemetery (FPE), 21620 Gulf Freeway, Webster,
Texas 77598. On February 11, 2014, the court granted a motion for Summary Judgment
authorizing Land Navigator to disinter and relocate to FPE any human remains found in and around
the cemetery area.
Versar, Inc. (formerly Geo-Marine, Inc.), provided all archeological and human osteological
expertise for the disinterment and analysis of the human remains. All activities were directed by
Versar, Inc., staff members: Mr. Duane E. Peter, Principal Investigator; Dr. Michelle Wurtz,
Project Coordinator; Dr. Catrina Whitley, Senior Bioarcheologist; and Mrs. Lindsey Skelton, Ms.
Natasha Nelson, and Mr. Brett Lang, Osteologists. The subsurface of the cemetery area was
examined to a depth of 6 feet to determine the presence of any burials (Figure 1). In addition, the
subsurface of an area to the north of the fenced cemetery was examined to a depth of 6 feet to
determine whether folklore concerning the burial of Confederate soldiers in that location was
accurate; no burials were found there. Excavated human remains and artifactual materials were
removed, analyzed on site, and photographed. All human remains and associated artifacts will be
reinterred at FPE.
Disinterment permits were obtained for each burial from the State Registrar of the Vital Statistics
Unit of the Department of State Health Services as required by Texas Administrative Code, Title
13, Chapter 22 (Texas Historical Commission, Cemeteries) (Appendix B). The archeological team
maintained a detailed record of all human remains and associated funerary objects removed. This
documentation will be maintained by the caretaker of the FPE cemetery and the Galveston County
Historical Commission. Exposure of the graves was initiated on April 7, 2014, and all
disinterments and on-site analyses were completed by May 15, 2014.

The disinterment excavations at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery revealed 34 burials from which 35
individuals were excavated. The disinterment process was a joint effort of individuals from Project
Navigator Ltd., Versar, Inc., and ENTACT, Inc. Equally important was the presence of Campbell
family members who visited and brought valuable information to the project. The authors
gratefully acknowledge the contributions of Mrs. Renee Hillman, Mr. Don Dick, Mr. Charlie
Gordy, Mrs. Shirley Phillips, Ms. Amy Phillips, Mr. James Phillips and Ms. Barbara Kirsten.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND

Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery is located in Texas City, Texas (Figures 2 and 3). The cemetery is
situated near Virginia Point, the nearest mainland feature to Galveston Island. The Site overlooks
Swan Lake to the north. The cemetery is on a low ridge between Swan Lake and Galveston Bay
to the east.

GEOLOGY
The Texas Bureau of Economic Geology has mapped Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery in the
Pleistocene-age Beaumont formation, with a stippled overlay that indicates that the area is
“[d]ominantly clay and mud of low permeability, high water-holding capacity, high
compressibility, high to very high shrink-swell potential, poor drainage, level to depressed relief,
low shear strength, and high plasticity; geological units include interdistributary muds, abandoned
channel-fill muds, and overbank fluvial muds” (Geological Atlas of Texas 1982:np). The
Beaumont formation formed primarily on stream channels, point bars, natural levees, and
backswamps, and to a lesser degree in coastal marshes and mud-flat deposits. The surface of the
Beaumont formation is characterized by abandoned stream channels, pimple mounds on meander
belt ridges, and low, relatively smooth areas that formed in backswamps (Bureau of Economic
Geology 2011). Efforts to date the Beaumont Formation have shown that it is at least 35,000 years
old (Tinsley 2010:9–10).
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), has mapped three soil map
units within the Malone Superfund Site: Ijam clay, 0 to 2 percent slopes; Ijam-Urban land complex;
and Narta fine sandy loam (Crenwelge et al. 1988). Ijam clay, 0 to 2 percent slopes, occupies only
a very small part of the project area in the southwestern corner and seems to correspond with a
landfill area. It is a nearly level to gently sloping, clayey soil that forms in dredged materials and
is therefore somewhat higher in elevation than the surrounding marshlands. The representative soil
profile begins with dark grayish brown clay approximately 25 centimeters (cm; 10 inches [in])
thick. The underlying C horizon consists of dark gray clay from 25 to 89 cm (10–35 in) below
surface, gray clay with a few sand strata from 89 to 142 cm (35–56 in) below surface, and bluish
gray sand with a few strata of sandy clay loam and oyster fragments from 142 to 155 cm (56–61
in) below surface. The SCS designated the bluish gray sand as a buried (2C) deposit (Crenwelge
et al. 1988:21, 85–86).
Ijam-Urban land complex coincides with the heavily developed portion of the project area. The
complex is composed of 40 to 60 percent Ijam soil with Urban land occupying the remainder. The
Ijam portion of the map unit exhibits a profile similar to that described above. The Urban portion
of the map unit consists of areas too heavily altered or obscured by construction to determine the
soil origin (Crenwelge 1988:22).

5

Narta fine sandy loam, the dominant soil within the project area, is a nearly level and poorly drained
upland soil that borders the coastal marsh. The solum for Narta series soils varies from 100 to 152
cm (30–60 in) thick. The typical soil profile begins with a dark gray fine sandy loam A horizon
about 23 cm (9 in) thick. The underlying B horizon is very dark gray clay from 23 to 36 cm (9–14
in), gray clay from 36 to 97 cm (14–38 in), and light gray clay from 97 to 152 cm (38–60 in) below
surface. Mottling in the B horizon is brown or yellow in color and varies from nonexistent to
common in frequency (Crenwelge et al. 1988:40, 91).

ENVIRONMENT
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) has mapped the project area as Urban land
(McMahon et al. 1984); however, adjoining areas in a similar environmental context are mapped
in the Marsh/Barrier Island ecotone. TPWD further subdivided this ecotone into four subtypes—
Maidencane-Alligator Weed (fresh) Marsh; Marshay Cordgrass-Olneyi Three-Square-Leafy
Three-Square (brackish) Marsh; Smooth Cordgrass-Marsh Saltgrass-Sea Ox-eye (saline) Marsh;
and Seaoats-Seacoast Bluestem Grassland—but the level of mapping does not distinguish among
these subtypes. More recent ecological mapping was undertaken by the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA 2004) that placed the project area in the North Humid Gulf Coastal Plain ecotone.
The original vegetation was primarily grasslands containing little bluestem, yellow Indiangrass,
brownseed paspalum, gulf muhly, and switchgrass. Occasional small areas of oaks, called oak
mottes, were present. However, Chinese tallow trees and Chinese privet now occupy large portions
of the ecotone. Riparian forests contain water oak, pecan, southern live oak, American elm, cedar
elm, and sugar hackberry. Canebrakes were sometimes found along creeks and rivers. Historically,
bison, pronghorn, and whitetail deer were present within the North Humid Gulf Coastal Plain,
although in smaller numbers than in the adjacent prairies to the north and west, and red wolf was
present in the riparian forests. Even today, birds and waterfowl are still relatively abundant
(Griffith et al. 2007). Fish and shellfish would also have been plentiful near the project area.

SECTION 3
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

HISTORY OF JAMES CAMPBELL
By most accounts, James Campbell, after whom the cemetery is named, was born in 1791 (although
Mary Campbell’s memoirs place his birth at 1786) in Derry, Ireland, and moved to the United
States shortly thereafter (Block 1991). After settling in Baltimore, he reportedly enlisted in the
U.S. Navy and served aboard the USS Constitution as a sail maker during the War of 1812 (Block
1991). Campbell took part in several important battles, including serving as a gunner during the
Battle of Lake Erie. After his naval enlistment ended, reports indicated Campbell joined a Spanish
ship, the Coujalado, and was one of four sailors who survived an attack by Captain Rapp, a
notorious English privateer (Tumlinson 1969). After being put ashore at Galveston Island,
Campbell sailed to New Orleans where he met and joined buccaneer Jean Lafitte. Lafitte and his
older brother were well-known for their privateering operations in New Orleans and Galveston,
then called Campeche, or Campeachy (Handbook of Texas 2008a). During a later privateering
operation in 1816, Campbell stopped at Crow’s Ferry, at the mouth of the Sabine River near what
is now Orange, Texas, and courted and married Mary Sabinal Crow (Block 1991). The two were
married in a bonding ceremony conducted by the local Karankawa Indians. After a failed attempt
to settle down and farm the land, James moved his wife to Galveston Island and again began
working for Lafitte. Campbell soon rose in rank, and by 1818 he became commander of his first
ship, the Concord (Block 1991). Campbell proved adept at capturing Spanish ships and was also
instrumental in managing Lafitte’s legal and financial operations. He remained one of Lafitte’s
most trusted lieutenants until 1821.
The year 1821 marked the end of the buccaneering days on Galveston Island. The president of the
United States sent orders for the pirates to leave the island, and by April of that year, Galveston
Island was abandoned (Block 1991). Although Lafitte urged James and Mary Campbell to
accompany him, the two instead sailed to New Orleans for supplies and then returned to Texas.
They relocated several times before settling at Galveston Bay near Swan Lake, on Campbell’s
Bayou in 1838 (Block 1991). James Campbell farmed and raised livestock at the site until his death
in May of 1856. Although no records of his interment exist, according to various newspaper articles
and family histories, he is buried, along with his wife, who died in 1884, at Campbell’s Bayou
Cemetery (Texas City Ancestry Searchers 1978, 1986).

History of Campbell’s Bayou and Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery
Located several miles south of what is now Texas City, Texas, Campbell’s Bayou was established
in the late 1830s when privateer and buccaneer James Campbell and his wife permanently relocated
to the area. With the help of local Karankawa Indians, the Campbells began to farm the land and
create a sustainable community. Goods could be traded between the mainland and Galveston, or
to passing ships, and these opportunities soon attracted other settlers (Hamilton 2010). This influx
of people eventually led to the departure of the Karankawa Indians.

9

Campbell’s Bayou gained significance at that time for reasons other than James Campbell’s
influence. Men from the settlement joined the Confederate Army during the Civil War, and the
bayou became home to 5,000 soldiers who camped there while waiting to attack Union forces in
Galveston (Warren 2010). Railroads infiltrated the area, and in 1859 the Houston and Henderson
Railroad Company built a wooden trestle connecting Galveston Island with the mainland. Other
bridges followed, but all were destroyed by an unnamed hurricane in 1910. The causeway that
exists today was completed in 1912 (Hamilton 2010). Many of those remaining in Campbell’s
Bayou moved inland when the 1900 hurricane hit Galveston. The hurricane destroyed much of the
community, including the Campbell homestead (Darst 1990; Warren 2010). A second hurricane in
1915 destroyed all remnants of the settlement (Warren 2010). Located adjacent to the Campbell
home site, Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery site 41GV171 and archeological sites 41GV113–41GB116
are the only surviving features of the settlement today.
The lack of existing headstones and conflicting sources makes it difficult to determine the exact
date of the first interment at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery. One source claims that the first burial
at the site was a young girl who died on the Campbell’s land, shortly after the Campbells settled in
the Swan Lake area in 1838. Several other documents posit that the death of the girl occurred
during the early 1860s, at the height of the Civil War and at least five years after the death of James
Campbell (Hauch et al. 2007). Though such an incident may have occurred, it is unlikely this
incident was the beginning of Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery. With the family residing at Virginia
Point from the 1830s, and since two of the Campbell’s children and James Campbell died before
the 1860s, such a scenario is implausible. The first interments at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery
should range between 1838 and James Campbell’s death in 1856 (Anonymous 1856; Hauch et al.
2007). At least 30 other individuals were reportedly buried on this plot of land (Texas City
Ancestry Searchers 1978, 1986). According to a newspaper article published in the Texas City Sun
(Gilletine 1990), these burials include Campbell and Parr family members as well as 12 unnamed
Confederate Civil War soldiers. However, no official burial records associated with the
Confederate soldiers could be located to corroborate the article. Potential names and burial
locations of those buried at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery are shown on Figure 4 (Hamilton n.d.).
The last known burial at the cemetery occurred in 1904 (Ancestry.com 2007). Hurricanes in 1900
and 1915 destroyed almost all traces of the original cemetery. Descendants re-created the surface
of the cemetery by placing temporary markers at potential grave locations.
Archival research conducted at the Galveston County Clerk’s office revealed that the Campbell
tract was originally conveyed to Samuel Bundick in 1832 by the Government of Mexico in a
Mexican Land Grant (Galveston County Clerk [GCC], Galveston, Texas, 1832:Deed Book [DB]
unknown). It is presumed that James Campbell took ownership of the property in the late 1830s;
however, no deed record of this transaction exists. After James Campbell’s death, the property was
passed to his wife, Mary, in 1858. Mary Campbell held the property until 1879, when the land was
deeded to her two grandchildren, Rebecca Campbell and Charles Campbell (GCC 1879:DB
unknown:65–67). Rebecca Campbell married J. H. Atkins during the late 1800s, and the Atkins
sold the land to E. L. Dick in 1897 (GCC 1897:DB 149:179). At some point, E. L. Dick sold the
property to Walter and Mabel Wetzel who sold the land to Paul and Ruby Malone in 1964 (GCC
n.d.:DB 821:15; GCC 1965:DB 1729:551–552). The Malone Company ceased operations in 1997
when its operating permits were revoked. The Malone Company subsequently entered Chapter 7
bankruptcy in 1998. The property was auctioned by the Federal Bankruptcy Court in 1999 and was
awarded to Southeast Texas Environmental. The site was subsequently acquired by Regor
Corporation in 2001. In 2009, the property was acquired by Land Navigator, Ltd. (N.A. 2009).

Prior to the disinterment, Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery (site 41GV171) was 70 feet wide and 70
feet long, and was surrounded by chain link fencing (Gillentine 1990) (Figures 5 and 6). The
primary entrance was constructed in the 1960s and consists of a double chain link gate under a
galvanized decorative sign supported by two brick columns. The arched sign displays the name of
the cemetery along with three symmetrically placed five-pointed flowers and a vine. Other design
features included numerous temporary replacement headstones consisting of concrete blocks,
concrete slabs, and unmortared brick. These headstones have not been marked and are often topped
with small ceramic, metal, and stone trinkets. Many of the blocks had been placed on top of other
larger blocks, and a concrete cross, lying flat at ground level, denotes this cemetery as a Christian
burial ground. All of the temporary markers appeared to be facing east; however, the locations of
the modern headstones had no correlation with the locations of the actual burials at the site (Figures
7–9). The current headstones are modern and likely were placed there relatively recently by a
descendant or descendants. Only one remnant of the historic material of the cemetery remained;
the base of a headstone located at the southeast side of the site. The base consisted of a broken
marble marker set in concrete, and the marker was broken off at the top of the base (Figure 10).
The marble section of the marker was missing from the cemetery site.

METHODOLOGY

DISINTERMENT PERMITS
Relocation of the graves at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery was regulated by Chapter 711 (Sections
711.004, 711.010 and 711.011) of the Texas Health and Safety Code. The process required
identification of the next of kin and their written consent to move the cemetery. Next of kin can
include the decedent’s surviving spouse, adult children, parents, siblings, or an adult person in the
next degree of kinship in the order named by law to inherit the estate of the decedent. Once
permission was obtained from the descendants who could be located, a petition was filed with the
district court for an order to remove the cemetery dedication and to relocate the remains. The Texas
Historic Commission and Galveston County Historical Commission were notified of the petition
filing. After the Court approved the petition, Disinterment Permits were obtained from Texas Vital
Statistics.
The lack of headstones or surficial indications of who is buried in the cemetery precluded the ability
to obtain individual specific burial disinterment permits. Instead, general disinterment permits
were given with the decedent’s name listed as “Unknown Burial #1,” with subsequent permits
occurring to “Unknown Burial #34” (Appendix A). These numbers correlate with the burial
numbers on the excavation and osteology forms. Burial numbers were assigned as the remains
were encountered and reflect the progress of the scraping (Figure 11). These burial numbers also
correlate with the Disinterment Permits as the number on the permit was assigned to each burial as
it was discovered. Some numbers do not follow the scraping pattern because of several false stains.
These numbers were reassigned to avoid confusion with the Disinterment Permits and prevent a
permit being issued for a grave that did not exist.

GRAVE SEARCH
In August 2013, ground-penetrating radar and an electromagnetic induction meter were used to
locate potential anomalies that possibly represented burials. Ten anomalies were identified within
the concrete boundary of the defined cemetery (Hunt et al. 2013). No anomalies were identified
outside the defined cemetery boundary. Previous disturbances can affect the ability of GPR to
detect these anomalies. The use of GPR to identify graves can be fraught with difficulties and
accuracy may be hindered due to soil conditions, thus making identification of burial shafts
difficult. Ground-truth excavations typically performed to calibrate GPR anomalies could not be
performed at the time of the survey. The geophysical interpretation therefore relied on the GPR
and EM survey data alone to outline potential graves in the area and ground-truth excavations had
to be deferred until the various regulatory approvals could be obtained for the grave excavation.
The GPR survey was augmented with historical aerial photo and topographic map analysis that
evaluated terrain, vegetation and soil patterns, fences, structures, excavations and industrial activity
in the cemetery area. This work established the cemetery had been present from the 1930s with no
obvious signs of other burials in the area.

17

Since the cemetery had to be moved, the search for graves at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery used
mechanical stripping to visually identify the grave shafts and ground-truth the anomalies.
Mechanical stripping involves the use of excavators and heavy equipment to remove vegetation
and soil in a controlled manner to expose grave shafts. Visual inspection is the most certain method
for locating graves. Given the size of the area (4,900 square feet) needing to be scraped (see Figure
11), mechanical excavation was necessary.
From April 7 to May 15 2014, grave identification and excavation were conducted at Campbell’s
Bayou Cemetery. Concrete slabs resembling sidewalks bounded the cemetery at the entrance on
the east side. A concrete slab associated with the Malone facility but detached from the cemetery
was present south of the cemetery boundary. A fence surrounded the cemetery which was anchored
within a concrete curbing or footing. Brick gate posts and a small metal swing gate marked the
entrance. Numerous grave decorations had been previously placed on the graves but were not
specifically related to the locations of buried remains. These decorations included glass bottles,
ceramic ginger beer bottles, figurines, and vases. Families had also placed small concrete stones
to mark suspected locations of graves (see Figures 7–9). These recent grave items were collected,
catalogued, and subsequently returned to the original location of the cemetery at the Site.
Success of mechanical scraping is dependent upon the skill level of the backhoe operator. Scraping
smooth, even cuts of sediment requires the excavator to make continuous adjustments. The
operators using the equipment were highly skilled and able to make the necessary cuts and remove
extremely small amounts of sediment when necessary.
In preparation for the excavation of the cemetery, heavy mechanical equipment (backhoe
excavator) was used to remove the trees and fencing and to prepare the surrounding area for
stockpiled soil. Following preparation of the area, workers began soil removal. Workers removed
the sediments from the cemetery surface in thin horizontal scrapes using a 4-foot-wide, smoothedged blade on the excavator.
When scraping was initiated, field crew members were unsure whether grave shafts would be
visible before encountering remains. Historic graves vary in depth because grave shaft size, water
table level, bedrock, hard soil, season, etc., can affect the depth of each grave. Scraping proceeded
cautiously throughout the project to ensure no burials were destroyed. Investigations began in the
northeast corner of the cemetery removing sediments within an area of approximately 30 feet by
15 feet. Scraping continued in this area until the water table was encountered at about 4.5 feet.
Excavations moved to the southwest and the first two burials were encountered. These grave shafts
were evident at the boundary between the very dark gray clay and the brown loam clay, at
approximately 3.5 feet. Mr. Duane Peter initially directed the scraping activities, moving in a
clockwise direction exposing Burials 1 and 2 first, moving southwest to expose Burials 3, 4, 5, and
10 (see Figure 11). He then directed the crew to scrape the southwestern half of the cemetery, to
the edge of Burial 16, exposing the southwestern edge of the burial container. Dr. Whitley
continued directing scraping activities for the course of the excavations with the backhoe situated
along the northeastern concrete border, parallel to the grave shafts (Figure 12). Unlike those
exposed during Mr. Peter’s monitoring, most of the remaining graves were shallow. Burials 30,
31, 9, and 27 were closely stacked together. Burial 9 was first encountered and had to be excavated
before the concrete vault (Burial 6) could be removed. Burials 30 and 31 were encountered after
two passes with the bucket. Once identified, an attempt to remove the concrete vault by scraping
away the sediments northwest of the crypt resulted in the exposure of Burial 27. No burials were
located under Burial 6. At Burial 22, a large square of disturbed sediment consistent with a grave
18

shaft was thought to be a mass grave. Random bricks and intermittent pieces of metal were found
in the fill. Continued scraping resulted in the tapering off of the potential grave shaft; however, a
metallic coffin with a viewing window was encountered when the backhoe clipped the lid. A total
of 34 burial shafts was located and were concentrated in the northeastern half of the bounded
cemetery (see Figure 11).

12. Backhoe excavations along northeastern concrete border

Figure 12. Backhoe excavations along northeastern concrete border.

Removal of the overburden continued until the outline of each coffin/casket was visible once the
grave shaft was identified. The grave shaft outline stayed consistent from discovery to the wood
outline of the burial container or arch. Stripping the sediments to the exposure of the container lid
or arch was necessary to assist in removing extra overburden. This resulted in a significant
reduction in excavation time. Burial 14 was the only burial impacted by scraping. Burial 14 was
an extremely shallow burial with poor wood preservation and the coffin/casket outline was not
visible. The left portion of the skull, clavicle, humerus, and the casket handle were impacted. All
remains and the casket handle were recovered and collected for reinterment.
Scraping and examination of the subsurface extended outside the boundary of the cemetery
concrete curbing to ensure all remains were removed. The curbing was placed in the late 1960s
when no headstones were present. Scraping extended outside the concrete curbing on all sides until
encountering subsurface mixed, gley soils (a subsurface layer of clay found beneath waterlogged
soils). The west and northwest portion of the cemetery at and beyond the concrete curbing
contained trash debris (Figure 13) that consisted of large modern metal debris, bricks, fiberglass,
steel rod in brick, a steel plate, copper electrical wire, a 6-x-6-inch creosote beam, automobile brake
pads, firebrick, concrete fragments, and cable wire. Scraping outside the southwest and southeast
curbing occurred until mixed soils were encountered. This soil was a mixed gley and also contained
scrap metal. Each boundary of the cemetery was scraped until mixed gley soils were encountered.
The mixed soils indicated the deposits were disturbed and likely outside the boundary of any
burials.
21

13. Modern inclusions marking edges of the disturbed areas

Figure 13. Modern inclusions marking edges of the disturbed areas.

Within the undisturbed cemetery boundary, sediments were scraped into the light yellowish brown
clayey, silty sand with gravels. Ground saturation, occurring between 4.2 and 4.8 feet, began in
this level. Several graves were excavated into this level, and as a result, the entire site was scraped
to a depth of 6 feet which was below the base of the deepest-known coffin.

EXCAVATION METHODS
Versar, Inc. personnel excavated the 34 unmarked graves from Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery.
Documentation of the excavations included photographs, daily logs, field notes, plan maps, burial
excavation forms, and burial analysis forms. Because the work was being performed within an
area potentially impacted by waste from the Malone Superfund Site, MCP representatives were
present to monitor work and ensure no uncontrolled waste materials were encountered in the
excavations and to oversee general site safety. Versar personnel were informed of the site
conditions and received safety training including use of appropriate personal protective equipment
22

prior to performing excavations. Safety meetings were conducted daily for all operating staff.
Hazards regularly identified include: work around heavy equipment, hot conditions, repetitive
motion activities, potential for cuts, punctures and splinters from metal, glass and wood and general
site safety issues relating to ongoing activity at the Site. In addition, safety representatives regularly
evaluated the excavation for sidewall and bottom stability.
Grave shafts were mapped and measured before excavation. Excavation of the overburden to the
arch or coffin/casket lid proceeded by careful hand troweling and/or the use of shovels noting any
items of significance within the fill above the lid or arch. The lid or arch and any hardware was
mapped and then removed. Documentation of subsequent layers of outer boxes and lids followed
the same protocol. Wood preservation was excellent in a majority of the burials, and once the lid
or arch was exposed, use of wooden tools and hand excavation was performed to recover remains
and artifacts.
Samples of arch wood, coffin/casket wood, and outer box wood were collected for species
identification analysis. Wood samples were packed in paper since they were not completely dry
by the end of the project. Each sample was labeled with the burial number and sample location,
such as lid, arch, base, wall, outer box. These samples were sent to Macrobotanical Analysis for
identification of the wood.
Burial excavation forms followed artifact collection protocols set by Tiné and Boyd (2003) and
Sprague (2005) (Appendix B). Coffin/casket hardware, nails, tacks, screws, and personal items
were collected by area (A, B, C, D, E) so that items not found in situ could be assigned to a portion
of the grave shaft:
 Area A defines the area from the cranium to the shoulders.
 Areas B and C are from the shoulders to the midline of the waist; Area B as the right side of
the body and Area C as the left.
 Areas D and E are from the midline of the waist to the feet; D as the right left and E as the left
leg.
Using the midline of the waist can result in several personal items being assigned to the legs even
though they may be from the wrists, so an effort was made to locate such items near the wrists and
waist in situ for mapping.
Burials below or at the water table had sticky clay that could not be penetrated with wooden tools.
These graves were excavated by hand with the archeologist using latex gloves. Clay does not stick
to the latex gloves and gives the archeologist tactile dexterity to remove the clay without damaging
the often friable bones. Remains were not rinsed for in situ photographs, and thus in some
instances, pictures of the skeletal elements were less than desirable because of the clinging clay.
In situ photography of personal items and casket/coffin hardware proved difficult in many instances
because of the sediment texture. Remains not under water were excavated with wooden hand tools
and natural-hair brushes.
Once in situ documentation was completed, artifacts were collected by area and/or by specific
location. Human remains were pedestaled when excavated as much as possible. This involves
excavating the surrounding area leaving the remains intact on a base higher than the surrounding
area. Direct contact with the coffin base hindered pedestaling in many instances. The skeletal
elements were undercut with wooden tools for removal. Human remains were wrapped in paper
by skeletal element and placed in a labeled cardboard box with the personal items and hardware
and stored on site. Once reaching the lab, they were washed and dried for analysis.
23

Many of the graves extended below the modern water table and filled with water when excavated.
Any portion of a burial below approximately 4.2 feet was in the modern water table. One burial
was excavated with standing water present; visibility was almost nonexistent and many bones,
teeth, and personal artifacts floated and moved to other areas. Water depth within the casket was
approximately 6 inches deep (Figure 14). Once it was apparent this would continue to be an issue,
a generator and a wet/dry vacuum were installed at the site. Excavation using the wet/dry vacuum
was successful without damaging skeletal elements. The wet/dry vacuum kept the remains visible
and could be used to remove sediment from around the bones without necessarily affecting in situ
recoding of hardware, personal items, and remains. When excavating by wet/dry vacuum, each
area was excavated separately and screened with ⅛- and 1⁄32-inch mesh by area to ensure integrity
in artifact collection.

14. Example of depth of water filling burials

Figure 14. Example of depth of water filling burials.

Two drainage areas were excavated with the backhoe to assist runoff away from the burials; the
areas also served as wash stations when remains needed to be screened during excavation. Large
barrels were provided for washing remains in the laboratory. All remains, hardware, and personal
items were washed and laid out to dry. Rust removal was only moderately attempted because of
potential damage to the hardware and personal items. Sediments near bone or that could contain
the remains of an infant or child were screened with 1⁄32-inch mesh. All other sediments from within
the coffin/casket were screened using ⅛-inch mesh. Photographs of coffin hardware, personal
items, and human remains with distinct pathology or other notable changes were taken at the
conclusion of analysis before transfer to the new casket. Once all analysis and photography were
complete, the human remains, hardware, and personal items were placed in the new casket and
24

secured with a permanent number tag that corresponds to the burial numbers in this report. Infant
remains and small children’s remains were placed in a smaller casket inside the larger casket due
to the size of the permanent caskets. Coffin/casket hardware analysis occurred through
photography provided to the specialist.
Burials and the extent of the scraped area were mapped by surveyor Mr. Joseph Baggett. Multiple
points and depth were taken on each burial that did not have to be removed before Mr. Baggett was
available. Outer box and arch outlines, when present, and coffin/casket outline depths were taken
for each burial, noting the shape of the outline. The niche between the arch and the coffin/casket
was also mapped when it could be discerned in arch burials. In many instances, the walls of the
niche had collapsed and the coffin/casket and arch wood had warped and sunk. Multiple depth
measurements to the base of the coffin/casket were also collected for each grave.

ANALYSIS OF THE SKELETAL REMAINS
The analysis of the skeletal remains occurred in an outdoor lab at the site while excavations
continued and moved to an on-site field laboratory once excavations were completed. Analytical
protocols followed Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994). Strict standards were implemented to ensure
measurements and nonmetric observations were recorded by the same individual. Skeletal remains
were laid in anatomical position. The crew collected data such as presence/absence of the skeletal
elements, completed the skeleton recording forms, and dental recording forms. All metric data,
nonmetric data, sex estimation, age estimation, scoring entheseal/musculoskeletal stress marker
changes, and pathological conditions were scored by Dr. Whitley.

CURATION OF MATERIALS
All artifacts collected were associated with graves and will be reinterred with the associated
remains. All field and laboratory records and maps were prepared for curation, including the
placement of these items in archivally stable containers. Field notes, burial forms, photographs,
and other data gathered during these investigations will be curated at the Galveston County
Historical Museum.

REINTERMENT OF REMAINS
All remains and funerary objects will be reinterred inside Forest Park East Cemetery. The remains
of each disinterred burial and its associated artifacts were placed in a specially made, individual,
solid pine box for reburial. The reinterment of the remains will be conducted under the supervision
of the attending mortician. An appropriate stone marker will be placed to commemorate the
deceased.

RESULTS

BURIAL AND MORTUARY DESCRIPTIONS
This section provides a description of the excavation, mortuary characteristics, and osteological
analysis results. A description of the excavation of each grave is provided, including crew
observations not covered in the mortuary characteristics forms. Mortuary characteristics include
burial shaft and coffin shape, size, and depth, presence or absence of a viewing window, paint, shell
in the fill, hardware, personal artifacts, and burial position. Osteological analysis includes
condition of the remains, age, sex, stature, dental inventory, dental pathology, pathology, and
entheseal changes.

PATHOLOGY
Human remains are the most direct evidence of the disease experience of past populations, though
only chronic disorders are visible on the skeleton. The immune status of the host, the virulence of
the parasites, the sensitivity of the population affected, malnutrition experienced by the population,
and ecological considerations all significantly influence the rates of infectious disease (Roberts and
Manchester 1995:129).
Infectious disease markers on the human skeleton can be divided into nonspecific and specific
infections. The skeleton is only able to respond to infection in a limited number of ways, with
many leaving changes that are indistinguishable from one another. For example, bony infections
from staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci, and typhoid bacillus bacteria all produce the same
indistinctive lesions (Roberts and Manchester 1995:126). However, periostitis, osteitis, and
osteomyelitis are three categories of nonspecific infections that leave identifiable changes to the
skeleton even though the specific cause of the infection cannot be identified. A handful of
infectious agents do leave distinctive patterns characterizing the disease itself and include diseases
such as tuberculosis, treponematosis, leprosy, brucellosis. Tuberculosis, treponematosis, and
leprosy are found in almost all populations world-wide and are the most archeologically visible.
Poor medical care, or the lack of, resulted in bacteria and viruses accounting for the majority of
deaths in the past, killing younger individuals at much higher rates than today. Infants and children
were highly susceptible due because of their vulnerability to respiratory and gastrointestinal tract
infections, which leave markers such as cribra orbitalia, periostitis, rickets, and scurvy. Even
without treatment, some infections cleared in a short amount of time, whereas others, such as
cholera, scarlet fever, lockjaw/tetanus, meningitis, typhoid, appendicitis, influenza, measles,
bronchitis, and pneumonia, could kill quickly (Roberts and Manchester 1995:125). Sickness
causing a relatively quick death that does not have an opportunity to affect bone, or simply does
not affect bone in the progression of the disease, will not leave changes. Therefore, it must be
remembered that inflammatory bone responses are the manifestations of long-term infections and
may not always be the direct cause of death.

27

The pathological descriptions listed in the burial descriptions below include processes outside of
infection identifying the presence of metabolic and endocrine, neoplastic, trauma, joint disease, and
infectious diseases. The bone alterations found in the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery population have
indications of trauma, such as fractures and vertebral fusion, evidence of bone infection, such as
woven or sclerotic bone, rheumatoid arthritis, trepanation, osteoarthritis, and Schmorl’s nodes.
COFFINS AND CASKETS
Exhumations at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery revealed a mixture of burial container shapes.
“Coffins” date to early interment traditions. Hexagonal-shaped coffins, the most common shape,
were generally six-sided with narrow heads, wide shoulders, and narrow feet. Coffins, however,
also were manufactured in several other shapes. A second type of coffin shape found at Campbell’s
Bayou Cemetery was the tapered box that has a wide head tapering to narrow feet. The third coffin
shape identified at the cemetery was an oval-ended or elliptical burial container. During the late
nineteenth century, though, these coffin shapes gave way to rectangular-shaped burial containers
termed “caskets.” Although coffins continued to be used as late as the 1920s (Bybee 2002),
preferences for caskets increased by the 1870s, and caskets were regularly found in coffin hardware
catalogs by the 1880s. Rectangular caskets were available as early as 1830, though they were not
in common use until after 1858 (Bybee 2002). The majority of the burial containers at Campbell’s
Bayou Cemetery are the later-dating “casket.”
DESCRIPTIONS OF BURIALS 1–34
The following discussions present descriptive information for each of the 34 burials. The burials
were of individuals ranging from preterm fetuses to infants and children, subadults, and adults
ranging in age from 25–60+ years (Table 1). The discussions present details about burial depth,
orientation, and body position; an inventory of artifacts; an osteological inventory; demographic
and pathological information; a dental inventory; and pathology data for dental, anomaly, and
modification noted on the remains. Burial numbers are those previously assigned by Versar, Inc.,
during discovery investigations. Burial depth refers to the depth from the ground surface to the
bottom of the burial container, as determined through GPS. In the following discussions, skeletal
preservation is defined as follows:
 Excellent: skeleton complete and fully intact
 Good: skeleton more than 75 percent complete, with most bones, particularly long bone
shafts, intact
 Fair: skeleton 25–75 percent complete and/or fragmented or deteriorated
 Poor: less than 25 percent of skeleton present and/or highly fragmented or deteriorated
Burial 1
Burial 1 is the grave of a 50–60-year-old male buried in an oval coffin. Transition analysis gives
an age-at-death range of 35–90, with the maximum likelihood at 66.8 years.
Burial 1 was the first burial discovered during scraping. During scraping, the grave shaft was first
apparent at 45.7 cm (1.5 feet) below surface. The backhoe continued to scrape the sediments until
the outlines of the coffin could be identified at 112.8 cm (3.7 feet) below surface. The Burial 1

shaft was originally excavated to or below the ground water level. Likely, the burial was submerged
in ground water on a continuous basis because the remains were well preserved and the cortex and
spongy bone dense and intact. These remains had a “china-like” quality and were a metallic gray
in color.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; grave shaft 196 cm SW/NE, 101 cm wide; depth,
112.8 cm (3.7 feet) to coffin outline and 146.3 cm (4.8 feet) to base of grave.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: No
Wood Arch: Yes. The wood arch consisted of three planks covering the torso and shoulder area.
Each plank was 28 cm wide and 65 cm long.
Outer Box: No
Coffin Description: Oval coffin made of wood; 169 cm SW/NE and 19 cm at the ends
Painted: No
Viewing Window: No
Hardware: No coffin hardware
Mortuary Artifacts: Square cut nails
Wood preservation: Good
Personal Items: A single white Prosser button was found near the left elbow. The button is 1 cm
(16 lines) in diameter and has four holes.
Burial Position/Taphonomy: The body was deposited on its back in an extended position. The
arms were semi-flexed with the right and left arms folded at the elbow and hands at the hips.
Skeletal Preservation: Excellent
Sex: Male
Age-at-Death: 50–60 years; transition analysis gives the maximum likelihood at 66.8 years.
Stature: 171.8 cm (5' 7.7")
Dental Inventory: Edentulous
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: Maxillary bone has resorbed to the nasal spine leaving
nothing but a flat palate. On the mandible, the bone has resorbed to the mandibular foramen.
Pathology: Pathological changes are consistent with an older adult. Damage to the left superior
and inferior facets of cervical vertebrae 5 and 6 and thoracic vertebrae 1 and 2, accompanied by the
fusion of cervical 3 and 4, suggest trauma to the neck. The inferior superior left facets have
31

eburnation across the surface with macroporosity and sharp lipping. At the superior facets, the
bone has resorbed leaving an indentation, or buttress, into which the inferior facets of the superior
vertebrae fit. In addition to the osteoarthritis, Schmorl’s nodes occur on the superior portion of the
bodies of vertebrae lumbar 1 and thoracic 9, 10, 11, and 12.
Entheseal Changes: Osteoarthritis is present on the vertebral column, wrists, and ankles.
Osteophytes are present on greater than two-thirds of the body of cervical 2, 3, 4, and 6 and are
present on the anterior body of thoracic vertebrae 5 through 12. These osteophytes curve
superiorly. Cervical 3 and 4 are fused at the body and the inferior and superior facets. Osteophytes
are present on the lateral portions of the body. Robusticity is present on the majority of the
musculoskeletal stress markers. Osteophytes are present on the right anterior body of thoracic
vertebra 11, extending 5.7 millimeters (mm) and curving superiorly. Lumbar vertebra 5 also has a
large osteophyte extending 9.9 mm on the right body and 5.8 mm on the left body. Articulations
on all long bones and carpals have slight eburnation with a sharp lip.

Burial 2
Burial 2 contains the remains of a male of older age who is edentulous.
Burial 2 was discovered during scraping at the same time as Burial 1 and is the easternmost grave.
The grave shaft was first apparent at the silty clay horizon approximately 45.7 cm (1.5 feet) below
surface. The backhoe scraped the sediments until the outlines of the coffin could be identified at
103.6 cm (3.4 feet) below surface. Burial 2 shaft was originally excavated to the ground water
level but not as deeply as Burial 1 shaft. No ground water seeped into the excavation. The remains
were friable and in poor condition. Their condition may be a result of being just above the water
table and probably subjected to cycles of inundation. Wood preservation in this grave was poor
except along the base of the grave.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Pinch-toe tapered grave shaft; 204 cm SW/NE and 88 cm wide. The
top of the coffin was 103.6 cm (3.4 feet) from the surface and 128 cm (4.2 feet) at the greatest
depth.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: No
Wood Arch: No
Outer Box: No
Coffin Description: Tapered/Pinch-toe; 175 cm SW/NE; 69 cm at headboard; 39 cm at footboard
Painted: No
Viewing Window: No
Hardware: No
Mortuary Artifacts: Square cut nails
Wood preservation: Good
32

Personal Items: Numerous buttons were found with these remains. Five four-hole bone buttons,
15 mm (24 lines), were in the burial. They were located at the midshaft of the right humerus, one
at the pelvis, one on each wrist, and one from an unknown location. In total, three Prosser buttons
were found: one at the neck, the pelvis, and the left knee. Those at the pelvis and knee are 12.5 mm
(20 lines) four-hole dish type plain buttons with no design, and the Prosser button at the neck is
12 mm (18 lines). A single metal button with a corroded shank was found in area E of the grave.
The button design is consistent with a cloth-covered button. Shank shape and size are
unidentifiable.
Burial Position/Taphonomy: This is a single burial with the body deposited on its back in an
extended position. The legs were extended and the arms folded at the elbow with hands placed
over the hips; right hand on left hip and left hand on the right hip.
Skeletal Preservation: Fair
Sex: Male
Age-at-Death: Older Adult
Stature: 173 cm (5' 8") based on body length in grave
Dental Inventory: Edentulous
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: The individual lost all teeth, with complete resorption
of all tooth sockets. Maxillary resorption is almost to the nasal spine, and mandibular resorption is
to the mandibular foramen with a sharp margin retained at the location of the incisors.
Pathology: Bones are friable and very fragmented, precluding the observation of the extent of
pathological changes. Of those that are observable, the left acetabulum has lipping, porosity, and
the development of sclerotic bone on the lateral edge. On the sternal facet of the right clavicle, a
sclerotic area of bone, measuring 9.6 mm medial-lateral and 8.3 mm anterior-posterior, is present.
The sternal facet also extends on the anterior edge.
Entheseal Changes: Exostoses are present on the posterior superior surfaces of the left and right
olecranon process. The right is more developed than the left, with the left having minimal
development of exostoses. Exostoses extend 8.7 mm on the olecranon process on the right. This
is also termed an olecranon spur. Capasso et al. (1999) defines this entheseal change as a
“woodcutters lesion,” and it is consistent with occupations such as woodcutting, blacksmithing,
and baseball playing. These activities involve stress on the triceps brachii insertion during flexion
and extension with maximum stress when the arm is horizontal, flexed elbow, and working at full
force (Capasso et al. 1999:78). General hypertrophy of the right and left humerus suggests general
habitual stress on this bone that could have been extreme.

33

Burial 3
Burial 3 contains the remains of an infant 0–3 months of age.
Burial 3 was discovered the same day as Burial 1 during scraping. The grave shaft was evident at
the silty clay horizon approximately 45.7 cm (1.5 feet) below surface. Scraping occurred until the
outlines of the casket could be identified at 97.5 cm (3.2 feet) below surface. No ground water
seeped into the excavation. The viewing window had slumped to the southwest side of the grave,
and the remains at the head of the grave were in good condition. Remains were only found under
the viewing window. Adipocere was also present and in thick strips under the viewing window. A
large tangle of rootlets had collected under the viewing window. It is possible the casket was
painted red, but this could not be confirmed. Blotches of red under the viewing window that are
consistent with the color of red paint in other caskets in the cemetery suggest the presence of paint.
Sediments around the grave appeared intact with no disturbance; however, the east wall of the
casket appeared to be sheared and removed. Casket wood could be removed in large strips, and
some removed as complete planks.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 98 cm SW/NE and 88 cm wide; top of the coffin was
97.5 cm (3.2 feet) from the surface and 143.3 cm (4.7 feet) at the greatest depth.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: Directly on the outer box lid were mussel shells with a 25 percent–40
percent concentration. Large amounts of pea-sized gravels were within the burial itself. This may
be due to the burial having been excavated into the sand clay sediments that had gravel inclusions.
Wood Arch: No
Outer Box: Rectangular; 98 cm SW/NE and 46 cm in width. The outer box was irregular due to
collapse and warping of the wood, most evident near the viewing window. The viewing window
had slumped west of its original position with the western edge of the glass slumping inferiorly.
The lid of the outer box and the casket were in contact and could be separated based on the casket
hardware and a small amount of sediment between the two in certain areas.
Casket Description: Rectangular; 76 cm SW/NE; 26 cm in width; large amounts of pea-sized
gravels encountered within the casket
Painted: Possible but inconclusive, red
Viewing Window: Ovoid; 27 cm long axis; 14.5 cm at head and 17 cm at the base
Hardware: Yes
Mortuary Artifacts: Square cut nails
Wood Preservation: Excellent
Personal Items: No personal artifacts recovered
Burial Position/Taphonomy: This is a single burial that was semi-articulated and disturbed.

34

Skeletal Preservation: Good
Sex: Unknown
Age-at-Death: 0–3 months
Stature: N/A
Dental Inventory: All teeth present are deciduous. Maxillary right molar 1 (M1), and both incisors
1 (I1) are present. Mandibular teeth include the right M2, and I1. Left mandibular teeth include
I1, I2, canine (C), and M1 and M2. Development was not complete with complete crown formation
and partial formation of the crown on the lateral incisors and molars 1 and 2. Only the tip of the
canine had developed. Development for the molars and canines was scored as a 4 or 5.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: No pathological conditions observed on the dentition
Pathology: No pathological changes observed on the skeletal remains
Entheseal Changes: N/A

Burial 4
Burial 4 was devoid of preserved skeletal remains. Casket length suggests an individual less than
3–4 years of age.
Burial 4 is located south of Burials 1 and 2. This burial was one of the easternmost graves at the
site. It is likely the lid warped until it touched the base of the casket, making it difficult to identify
the lid from the base. The southwest corner of the casket was missing. Dark gray matrix filled the
irregularly shaped grave shaft. The casket outline was distinct and dug into the clay layer. Moist
sediments with an organic fill and rootlets were within the grave fill, and a distinct shell layer lay
directly on the lid.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Irregular rectangular; 122 cm SW/NE and 59 cm wide.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: Distinct shell layer of moderate concentration directly on the casket
lid
Wood Arch: No
Outer Box: No
Casket Description: Rectangular; 96 cm SW/NE; 32 cm at the head and shoulders and 28 cm at
the feet. Though the grave shaft was irregular, the casket had little warping except the hard-to­
identify lid.
Painted: No
Viewing Window: No

Burial 5
Burial 5 contains the remains of a possible male, 9–11 years age-at-death.
Burial 5 was exposed after excavation of Burials 4 and 3 because of stratigraphic placement. This
burial was deeper than the other two although neither Burials 3 nor 4 lay directly on top of Burial
5. Exposure later was necessary due to the width of the bucket that would have damaged both
burials. At the time of excavation, the crew noted the grave was larger than those encountered for
the small children, but not large enough to be a full-sized adult.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Semi-ovoid; 190 cm SW/NE and 73 cm wide. The top of the grave
shaft was 140.2 cm (4.6 feet) from the surface and 161.5 cm (5.3 feet) at the greatest depth.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: No
Wood Arch: Rectangular; 185 cm SW/NE and 38 cm at the head, 58 cm at shoulders and 35 cm at
the footboard.
Outer Box: No
Coffin Description: Hexagonal; 182 cm SW/NE; 18 cm at the headboard, 40 cm at the shoulders
and 17 cm at the footboard. Unlike most of the other burials in Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, only
5 cm of sediment had to be removed between the exposed outline of the coffin lid and the exposure
36

of the entire lid. The lid was very thin and lay directly on the remains, adhering to the bones.
Sections of the coffin walls were missing, and those present were poorly preserved. Sediments
within and around the burial were moist but not sticky.
Painted: White paint is present on large sections of the wood.
Viewing Window: No
Hardware: Ornamental tacks and lining tacks
Mortuary Artifacts: Square cut nails and miscellaneous wire nails
Wood Preservation: Fair
Personal Items: Buckle fragments were found in the pelvic area. Five buttons were found at the
waist and two additional buttons were found in the screen. All are plain, white dish Prosser buttons:
three are 16 mm (26 line) and four are 10 mm (16 lines).
Burial Position/Taphonomy: The remains are in excellent condition. This interment contained one
individual lying on its back. The remains were semi-articulated and in an extended position. Both
humeri were tightly positioned against the side of the body. The right and left arms were folded at
the elbow, and the hands placed at the lower chest approximately and lumbar 1.
Skeletal Preservation: Excellent
Sex: Possible male; greater sciatic notch was distinctly shaped as a level 5. However, sexing
methods of juvenile remains have lower success rates than in adults because of prepubescent
development of sexual characteristics.
Age-at-Death: 9–11 years
Stature: Unknown
Dental Inventory: No deciduous dentition remained. Mandibular right and left third molars are
the only dentition missing.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: Cavities were present on most teeth. Mandibular left
and right first molars and the right second incisor had cavities that destroyed the crown and
extended into the root. Interproximal caries were most prevalent and, if present, were on the mesial
and distal sides of the tooth. The following teeth had interproximal caries maxillary right premolar
one (PM1), C, and I1 and I2; left maxillary I1 and I2, and PM1 and PM2; mandibular right PM1
and PM2, C, and maxillary left I1, I2, C, and M2. Occlusal caries are on the molars with one
lingual carie on the mandibular buccal surface of PM1. In addition, hypoplasia is extensive,
affecting almost every tooth. Most likely a result of systemic metabolic stress, recurrent insults are
present at the ages of approximately 1, 2, 2 years 7 months, 3 years 6 months, 4 years 8 months, 5
years 2 months, and 5 years 7 months.

37

Pathology: No gross observable pathological changes were evident on the skeletal remains. The
bone was in excellent condition with the cortex and spongy bone well preserved and intact;
excluding the vertebrae and ribs.
Entheseal Changes: No

Burial 6
Burial 6 contains the remains of two individuals aged 0–1/term month and 12–15 months.
Burial 6 was discovered by accident when the backhoe struck the concrete crypt lid during scraping.
No grave shaft was visible, and there was no indication a grave would be in that location. At a
depth of 88.4 cm (2.9 feet), the grave was still within the topsoil/silt stratigraphic layers. The two
infants were placed in the same concrete vault with an ovoid lid and hexagonal area in the center
for a coffin. The vault was surrounded by handmade bricks around the edge of the lower half of
the concrete crypt. The concrete lid rested upon the lower portion of the crypt and the bricks. Upon
opening the crypt, no coffin was visible. Rots and sediment filled the base. The southwest base of
the crypt was broken and roots protruded through the organic sediment. Fragments of bricks and
rocks also lay in the base. Removal of the sediments filling the lowest few centimeters of the crypt
resulted in the collection of several fragments of bricks and recovery of some skeletal remains. The
dirt that was able to be gathered, including some from the area slumped under the southwest area
(head), was screened and many more remains were found. At the time of final scraping to ensure
no additional remains were present, a small area that was under the crypt appeared. Sediments
from the circular area were collected and screened. Additional remains were in these sediments;
likely, the roots in the concrete crypt were associated and had disturbed the remains, pulling them
deeper into the ground.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: None observable
Items of Note in Grave Fill: None
Wood Arch: No
Outer Box: Yes; concrete crypt. The lid is 120 cm in length SW/NE, headboard 34 cm, shoulders
60 cm, footboard 34 cm. The shape of the space for the coffin is hexagonal and 90 cm in length,
20 cm at the headboard, 34 cm at the shoulders, and 20 cm at the footboard.
Coffin Description: Unobservable
Painted: Unknown
Viewing Window: No
Hardware: No
Mortuary Artifacts: Cut nails and brick
Wood Preservation: Poor

Burial 7
Burial 7 contains the remains of a female 60+ years of age-at-death
Burial 7 is in the line of graves defining the southernmost edge of the cemetery. The grave shaft is
oriented southwest to northeast. The casket outer box and lid warped with steep sides angling 45–
60 degrees. A large section of the casket lay relatively level, due to the presence of the viewing
glass. The oval viewing window is large and extends from the face to mid-torso. A wood lid
covered the viewing window. The outer box and casket lid warped 35 cm in depth from the wood
outline exposed during scraping. The outer box was defined by the presence of casket nails and
screws and the presence of casket hardware.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 182.8 cm SW/NE and 88.9 cm wide. Depth to the
visible coffin outline is 112.8 cm (3.7 feet) and the base of the grave is 155.4 cm (5.1 feet).
Items of Note in Grave Fill: None
Wood Arch: No
Outer Box: Rectangular; 182.8 cm SW/NE and 88.9 cm wide
Casket Description: Rectangular; 170.1 cm SW/NE and 60.9 cm at the headboard, 58.4 cm at the
shoulders, and 50.8 cm at the footboard
Casket Painted: Yes: painted red
Viewing Window: Ovoid; 60 cm in length, 22 cm upper width, 29 cm middle, and 27 cm lower
area. The glass is 2.3 mm thick, though glass thickness varies with other fragments, with those
closest to the edge of the glass measuring 1.8 cm. When viewed on its edge, the glass has a green
tint rather than the clear glass seen when lying flat. The glass has slight hazing but no opalescent
sheen.
Hardware: Yes
Mortuary Artifacts: Nails and screws
Wood Preservation: Excellent
Personal Items: A hard rubber comb was found at the occipital protuberance. The texture and
color mimics bone. The seven tines are rubbed smooth and do not retain the rough bone-like
texture. Two of the tines are broken. The comb is 7 cm by 8 cm. A similar “Rubber Back Comb”
is in the Sears, Roebuck and Co. 1897 catalogue (pg. 839); each comb sold for $0.07. Six two-hole
shell buttons of the same size were in situ in a line down the center of the body under the viewing
window. Although most buttons fragmented after being removed, two survived and measure 12.7
mm (20 lines). A small shell four-hole button measuring 9 mm (14 lines) and a dish-shaped Prosser
16-mm (26 lines) button were found in area B. One button found during screening is a white, dish
shaped Prosser, 10 mm (16 lines).

40

Burial Position/Taphonomy: Interment is a single burial with articulated and extended skeletal
remains. The cranium–pelvis orientation is SW/NE, with the head in the southwest. The head is
turned to the left and is not tipped or tilted. The arms are fully extended to the sides of the body
with the hands at the thighs.
Skeletal Preservation: Poor; remains that survived were those in direct contact with the viewing
window
Sex: Female
Age-at-Death: 60+
Stature: Unknown
Dental Inventory: N/A; all mandibular bone was missing. No teeth were found during screening.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: N/A
Pathology: Evidence of healed trepanation is present on the right parietal. The removed area of
bone is 60 mm superior to inferior in orientation and 55 mm anterior-posterior. The parietal damage
is consistent with the method of scraping since the edge is beveled and the bone pinches to a sharp
ridge. The bone is fully healed and there is no evidence of woven or sclerotic bone. The thin bone
closest to the center of the removed bone is 1.7 mm thick whereas the undamaged bone is 6.4 mm
thick.
Entheseal Changes: N/A

Burial 8
Burial 8 contains the remains of a probable male aged 25–35 years-at-death.
Burial 8 is west of Burial 7 in the southernmost row of graves in the cemetery. The grave was dug
well into the water table and excavations were difficult due to the constant filling of the grave.
Large ditches to drain water from the excavation area helped, but only with burials not dug as
deeply. The water table begins around 137.2 cm (4.5 feet). Bones were recovered as best they
could but most were found through screening. The crew removed approximately 55 cm of sediment
from the exposed edges of the coffin to the top of the warped outer box. Upon removal of the soil,
the outline of a hexagonal coffin became visible; the coffin lid had collapsed toward the midline of
the grave with the wood molded around the remains. Mapping was difficult since the base of the
grave shaft was filled with 10–20 cm of water. In order to facilitate mapping and removal, bones
were staked with colored skewers. Crania and feet were taken out as a unit and screened to find
remains.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 220 cm SW/NE and 90 cm wide. Depth to coffin outline
134.1 cm (4.4 feet), and base 173.7 cm (5.7 feet).
Items of Note in Grave Fill: No

41

Wood Arch: No
Outer Box: Rectangular; 202 cm length, 69 cm headboard, 78 cm shoulders, 70 cm footboard
Coffin Description: Hexagonal; 184 cm SW/NE, 50 cm at headboard, 74 cm at shoulders, and
44 cm at footboard.
Coffin Painted: Yes, red
Viewing Window: No
Hardware: Yes
Mortuary Artifacts: 22 wire cut nails
Wood Preservation: Excellent
Personal Items: Two 12.5-mm (20 lines) four-hole dish-type Prosser buttons were found: one in
Area A and one in Area C. Areas A, B, and D have metal buttons that are 15 mm (24 lines). The
button in Area B is a two-piece domed metal button with a shank that is punched through the back,
shank missing. The button in Area A is a one-piece flat disc metal button, and the last in Area D
is a one-piece domed flat disc metal button.
Burial Position/Taphonomy: This burial is a single interment with the individual placed on its
back. The body was articulated and lay in an extended position. Cranium–pelvic orientation is
SW/NE with the cranium in the SW. Arms and hands were extended at the side.
Skeletal Preservation: Excellent
Sex: Probable male
Age-at-Death: 25–31 years
Stature: 168.5 cm ± 3.3 cm (5' 6.3")
Dental Inventory: Teeth are in good condition with maxillary left I2 and M3 missing. Mandibular
right M3, PM2, I2, and I1 and left I1 and PM 2 are missing. Each is missing with no associated
alveolar bone.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: Small caries are present on several teeth with the
majority as interproximal caries. These caries are on the right maxillary M1 mesial, I2 mesial and
distal, I1 distal, and left I1 distal. An occlusal carie is on the mandibular right M1. Dental calculus
occurs in minor, moderate, and heavy depositions. Minor calculus is on the maxillary right PM1
and left M1; and mandibular left M3, M1, PM1, and right PM1 and M2. Moderate deposits are on
the lingual side of the left C, and heavy deposits are on the lingual and labial sides of the left I2 and
right C. Enamel pits on the buccal groove and deep fissures are present on all observable molars.
These were also found in Burial 5.

42

Dental modifications associated with artifact use or production are present with this individual.
Tooth wear occurs in a pattern suggesting use of the mouth to hold objects. Significant polish wear
is present and several teeth have chips from use. Lingual wear is present on the maxillary canines,
and incisors. The left I1 and canine have polish extending across the occlusal plane with a chip on
the distal occlusal surface of I1. Right maxillary incisors and the canine have lingual wear and
polishing with chips on the mesial and distal sides of the canine. Right PM1 has polishing and a
wear facet on the lingual mesial side of the tip with a chip occurring at the most distal point of the
wear facet. On the mandible, left M1 and M3 have heavy wear on the buccal cusps. Occlusal
grooves and polished facets are on the mesial and distal sides of the mandibular left PM1. Both
facets angle toward the lips. The canine wear facet angles from distal to the occlusal plane. Polish
is across the entire labial surface of the right I2. The right canine has a polished facet 3.0 mm from
the tip of the occlusal surface and also has a wear groove on the distal edge. PM1 right has a
polished wear facet on the labial mesial tip. The angle, direction of facet wear, tooth chip location,
and teeth involved suggest this is occupational wear associated with using the mouth to hold
objects, and angle of pull of the item in the mouth is lower left to upper right.
Pathology: A distal foot phalange that had been broken had completely healed. Eburnation and
lipping s present on most of the articular surfaces. Left mandibular condyle exhibits eburnation
and pinpoint porosity with osteophytes on the mesial side. The corresponding temporo-mandibular
fossa had lipping, narrowing of the medial aspect of the fossa and eburnation. The dens and dens
facet of cervicals 1 and 2 have sharp lipping of the facet circumference with eburnation on the dens
facet of the atlas. Sharp lipping, eburnation and porosity is present across the distal epiphyses of
the femora. The femoral head, too, has lipping on greater than two-thirds with barely discernible
eburnation. The right patella has eburnation and lipping on greater than two-thirds of the bone.
The first proximal phalange of the foot has eburnation with pinpoint porosity and sharp lipping.
All tarsals, metatarsals, calcaneus, and talus have eburnation greater than two-thirds of the surface,
with coalesced porosity and a ridge of sharp lipping. This affects all facets.
Entheseal Changes: Neither medial clavicle has fused. The flake is present and fusing on the right
clavicle; however, the left flake is present and partially fused but also has a large resorptive lesion
in the center of the flake. Bilateral hypertrophy of the costal tuberosity and robusticity of the lateral
end of the clavicle. Robusticity is consistent with carrying heavy loads in both hands with arms
extended at the sides (Capasso et al. 1999:50). Costal syndesmosis, or hypertrophy of the costal
tubercle, is associated with general stress of the pectoral girdle when the shoulders are bent forward
moving heavy loads in a bent position. These lesions have been found in agricultural societies in
those responsible for ploughing, those carrying heavy weights from the shoulders like stone-house
building materials, and hunting. They were also found in individuals from the Mary Rose crew.
Their rigorous duties included tasks such as repairing canvas masts, use of long bows, and moving
cannons (Capasso et al. 1999:52). Musculoskeletal stress markers are moderate to heavy on the
clavicle and humerus with minimal changes on the femora.

Burial 9
Burial 9 remains had decayed and there was no evidence of skeletal remains. Casket length
suggests an individual under 3–4 years of age.
Burial 9 is southwest of the concrete crypt. Walls of the casket had collapsed first at the footboard,
with the side walls second. The resulting shape was unique because it had the appearance of an
ichthus or fish. The lid had sunk 17 cm in the center and adhered onto the base of the casket.
43

Numerous shells and shell fragments were in the fill directly above the casket lid and filling the
space between the collapsed walls and lid. Shell, particularly nonlocal clamshell, concentration
was approximately 25 percent. No personal artifacts were encountered. Casket and grave shaft
lengths are good correlates for the upper age limit of an individual (Condon et al. 1998; Whitley
2013; Whitley and Skinner 2012). This individual is unlikely to have a height greater than the
casket or grave shaft length. Therefore, the length of the casket at 96 cm indicates the burial was
that of a child under 3 years of age.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 126 cm SW/NE, 20 cm in width. Burial depth was
100.6 cm (3.3 feet) to the casket outline and 115.8 cm (3.8 feet) to the base of the casket.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: Clamshell concentration at 25 percent directly on the casket lid and
within the collapsed lid and walls of the casket.
Wood Arch: No
Outer Box: No

Burial 10
Burial 10 is a probable female. Age range could not be determined because of poor preservation
of the skeletal remains, and thus this individual could only be identified as an adult.
Burial 10 was one of the last burials excavated. The depth of the burial was very shallow, with
sticky clay. Small to medium gravels were in the grave fill, making it difficult to uncover the
remains without damaging them. Though the burial extended past the water table, water did not
fill the grave while excavating. The sidewalls of the grave shaft were undulating due to the collapse
of the casket on top of the remains.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular-rounded; 204 cm SW/NE, 42 cm in width. Burial depth
was 143.3 cm (4.7 feet) to the casket outline and 158.5 cm (5.2 feet) to the base of the casket.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: No
Wood Arch: Yes. The bench was rectangular and generally followed the outline of the grave shaft.
The arch measured 203 cm SW/NE, 49 cm at the headboard, 45 cm at the shoulders, and 50 cm at
the footboard. The wood is well preserved.
Outer Box: No
Casket Description: Rectangular-rounded; 203 cm SW/NE, 41 cm at the headboard, 32 cm at the
shoulders, and 32 cm at the footboard.
Casket Painted: No
Viewing Window: No
Hardware: Yes
Mortuary Artifacts: Wire nails
Wood Preservation: Fair
Personal Items: Two shell buttons of indeterminable size and one metal fastener.
Burial Position/Taphonomy: Preservation of the remains is poor and the burial is a single
interment. The remains were placed on the back in an extended position. Taphonomic processes
resulted in semi-articulation. Arms were semi-flexed at the elbow, with the hands over the pelvic
area.
Skeletal Preservation: Poor
Sex: Probable female
Age-at-Death: Adult
Stature: 153.1 cm ± 3.7 cm (5'.3")

45

Dental Inventory: Maxillary and mandibular incisors right and left I1 and I2, and the right C are
present.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: Severe attrition with exposure of secondary dentin on
all incisors and canines is present. Wear is extensive enough to leave only two-thirds of the root.
Maxillary right C and I2 have crown present. The right I2 is worn flat, leaving approximately oneeighth of the crown. The right C has angled wear, leaving about one-half of the distal portion of
the crown and wear to two-thirds of the root.
Pathology: Medial line of the right femoral linea aspera has sclerotic and woven bone with clocoa
consistent with acute osteomyelitis. The clocoa drains in a superior direction. The lesion is
62.3 mm superior-inferior and 11.9 mm medial-lateral. Active periostitis is present on the right
radial tuberosity.
Entheseal Changes: General humeral hypertrophy expressed as a level 2 is present on the right
humerus. The right radius and ulna have general hypertrophy as well, suggesting moderate to heavy
use of the arms. The femora have barely discernable entheseal changes. This suggests more use
of the arms than legs.

Burial 11
Burial 11 contains the remains of a juvenile approximately 6 years of age.
Burial 11 was located near Burials 6 and 9. The surveyor took depths to the top of the grave shaft.
Scraping of the area and complete removal of the burial area had to occur before the surveyor was
able to take a depth. The depth of the burial was similar to that of Burial 9. Coffin shape is a true
tapered coffin, though the footboard appears more consistent with a mummy coffin due to coffin
collapse. This burial has a viewing window, ovoid in shape and extending to the lower chest area.
The viewing window was covered by a lid and was clearly visible due to the wood grain.
Unfortunately, the window did not survive in one piece. The coffin slumped to the west with the
viewing window tilted to the base of the coffin. The skull was pushed against the east wall of the
coffin. Button alignment suggests the body shifted to the east side of the coffin. Both femora rolled
laterally losing articulation with the pelvis. Four coffin handles, five thumbscrews, and three
escutcheons were affixed to the coffin. The thumbscrews had “At Rest” inscribed and the
escutcheons had crosses. A nameplate at the waist read “Our Darling” and a gold plated “Papa’s
Pride” nameplate was affixed to the headboard of the coffin. Shell was concentrated directly on
the lid. The small- and medium-sized oyster shell comprised 40 percent of the sediment.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 150 cm SW/NE, 62 cm wide; depth 100.6 cm (3.3 feet)
to the top of the grave shaft and approximately 115.8 cm (3.8 feet) to the bottom of the coffin.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: Shell concentration of small oyster shells at 40 percent. The shell lay
only directly on the lid and was not in the grave fill.
Wood Arch: No
Outer Box: No

46

Coffin Description: Toe pincher; 111 cm SW/NE; 25 cm at the headboard, 28 cm at the shoulders,
and 6 cm at the footboard. Sidewalls have collapsed slightly and toe pincher shape is more visible
at base of coffin.
Coffin Painted: No
Viewing Window: Ovoid; long axis 38 cm, 20 cm in width at base, and 10 cm at top
Hardware: Yes
Mortuary Artifacts: “Papa’s Pride” gold-plated nameplate, measuring 3.5 cm long, affixed to the
headboard
Wood Preservation: Excellent
Personal Items: One shell button of unknown size was located at the feet, but it fragmented during
removal. Three Prosser buttons, 12 mm (18 lines), were aligned along the torso from the waist
angled toward the skull, and another was found at the pelvis. A 13-mm (20 lines) Prosser button
was at the right hip.
Burial Position/Taphonomy: The body was placed on the back as a single interment. The remains
were semi-articulated because the torso and skull had been shifted east, either due to movement
while burying or collapse of the coffin. The placement of the buttons in alignment suggests the
body was shifted east while the tissue was still intact and could pull the clothing with the remains.
The body was laid in an extended position with a cranium–pelvis orientation of southwest for the
head and northeast for the feet. The arms were extended but bent at the elbows with hands over
the opposite hip.
Skeletal Preservation: Fair to good condition
Sex: Unknown
Age-at-Death: 5–7 years, dentition indicate 5.8–6.2 years
Stature: N/A
Dental Inventory: Missing deciduous teeth were shed naturally. The teeth present include the
mandibular right and left dM2, dM1, C, and left I1. Mandibular deciduous dentition includes right
and left dM2, dM1, C, right I2. Permanent teeth include maxillary right and left M1, PM1, left
PM2, right and left C, I1, and I2. Mandibular permanent dentition present is the right and left M2,
M1, PM1, PM2, C, I2, and left I1. None of the permanent teeth is completely developed. Several
are still in the tooth crypt.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: Interproximal caries are present on the medial and
distal surfaces of the left maxillary M1. No caries have developed on the permanent teeth. Both
upper incisors have dental hypoplasia at 6.2 mm and 4 mm from the cemento-enamel junction. The
lower right canine has a hypoplasia at 2.8 mm. Incisor hypoplasia occurred at approximately 1.7
and 2.7 years. The lower canine hypoplasia occurred around 4.9 years. The hypoplasia indicates
multiple insults to the health of this individual numerous times before death around 6 years of age.

Pathology: No observed pathological changes.
Entheseal Changes: N/A

Burial 12
Burial 12 contains the remains of an infant aged 3–6 months.
Burial 12 was one of the last few burials to be found. The burial was in the farthest north row of
the cemetery near the gates. This burial was not excavated very deeply and was at the same level
as many of the other infant and juvenile graves. Many adults were excavated to a lower depth,
indicating differences in grave depth between adults and juveniles and infants. This burial has an
arch with a root throughout the grave shaft and some bioturbation. Upon encountering the lid of
the casket, it appeared to be a tapered coffin; however, the sides of the casket had collapsed creating
a false shape. Shell fragments and a whole shell were found in the grave shaft along with scattered
glass fragments. The burial had slumped to the west side, making it difficult to locate and excavate
the remains. Much of the skeletal elements adhered to the casket wood, and planks from the base
of the casket were removed while water screening. The remains had a dark metallic sheen, almost
opalescent.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 140 cm SW/NE, 75 cm wide; depth 97.5 cm (3.2 feet)
to the top of the grave shaft and approximately 121.9 cm (4.0 feet) to the bottom of the coffin.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: Shell and glass fragments were in the grave fill. During excavation,
five to six large clamshell fragments and one whole shell were found. The glass fragments, as well
as the shell, were found scattered near the top of the casket. These were near or on the grave arch.
Wood Arch: Rectangular/Rectangular-rounded; 140 cm SW/NE, 46 cm head, 46 cm shoulders, 30
cm foot.
Outer Box: No
Casket Description: Rectangular; 85 cm SW/NE; 16 cm at the headboard, 19 cm at the shoulders,
and 8 cm at the footboard. Collapsed sidewalls have slightly warped the casket.
Casket Painted: No
Viewing Window: No
Hardware: Yes
Mortuary Artifacts: 21 cut nails. Thin copper sheeting was observed in the burial near the upper
chest area. The sheeting was very thin and crumbled upon contact. It was impossible to discern
what it was, whether it was part of the coffin hardware or perhaps had a personal use. Defining its
placement within or on top of the casket could not be determined either.
Wood Preservation: Excellent

48

Personal Items: At the waist, a safety pin fragment was found at the sacrum indicating the infant
was buried in a diaper. Numerous buttons were found along the centerline suggesting the infant
was buried in a dress. Seven Prosser buttons were found in alignment from the neck to the waist
including one 10-mm (16 lines) button, four 9-mm (14 lines) buttons, and two 7-mm (12 lines)
buttons. Buttons were found on the right side of the body and it is unclear why there were numerous
buttons on the right side with no correspondence of numbers on the left. Prosser buttons in Area B
include three 9-mm (14 lines) and one 7-mm (12 lines) specimens. Two buttons were found during
screening: one 7 mm (12 lines) and one 9 mm (14 lines).
Burial Position/Taphonomy: The remains were in poor condition and difficult to identify because
they were adhering to the wood. Much of the wood was removed for flotation in the lab. The
button alignments provided clues as to how the body was deposited. This was a single interment
with the body laid on the back in an extended position. Some of the burial was disturbed. The
head-to-foot orientation was southwest to northeast.
Skeletal Preservation: Poor; very few bones were recovered.
Sex: Unknown
Age-at-Death: 3–6 months
Stature: N/A
Dental Inventory: Deciduous teeth include maxillary right and left M2, M1, C, I2, I1, and
mandibular right M2, right and left M1, and the right I2. None was fully developed and the tooth
length was used for aging. The pars basilaris also identified the age at 5–8 months.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: No
Pathology: No observed pathological changes.
Entheseal Changes: N/A

Burial 13
Burial 13 contains the remains of an adult that is probably a male.
Burial 13 was along the most southern row of burials in the cemetery. The backhoe scraped the
sediments to the outline of the coffin. No outer box or grave arch was present, and the depth from
the coffin outline to uncovering the full lid was only 7 cm. No coffin hardware was found with this
burial. A lead ovoid slug was in the skull cavity. Crania fragments exhibited no evidence of trauma
or bullet wounds. Postmortem breakage of the skull provides evidence the slug entered the cavity
during decomposition.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Hexagonal; 195 cm SW/NE, 60 cm wide; depth 112.8 cm (3.7 feet)
to the top of the grave shaft and approximately 128 cm (4.2 feet) to the bottom of the coffin.

49

Items of Note in Grave Fill: No
Wood Arch: No
Outer Box: No
Casket Description: Hexagonal; 180 cm SW/NE; 39 cm at the headboard, 50 cm at the shoulders,
and 25 cm at the footboard. Sidewalls had collapsed and extended over the left and right upper
arms at the elbows.
Casket Painted: No
Viewing Window: No
Hardware: No
Mortuary Artifacts: 43 cut nails of varying sizes
Wood Preservation: Good
Personal Items: One ovoid lead slug of unknown origin measuring 36.8 mm in length, 24 mm in
width at the widest point, and 4.0-4.1 mm in thickness lay in the skull. This lead slug weighed 28
grams. At the lower abdomen were two plain Prosser buttons, 14 mm (22 lines). One four-hole
sew-through iron button, 12 mm (18 lines) with a metal ring around the outer margin of the button,
was located in Area B on the center of the right ilium.
Burial Position/Taphonomy: The remains lay in an extended position as a single, articulated
interment. The cranium–pelvis orientation was SW/NE with the skull in the southwest. The head
was turned to the right. The arms were folded with the left hand on the left innominate and the
right hand at the waist.
Skeletal Preservation: Fair to Good
Sex: Probable male
Age-at-Death: Adult
Stature: N/A
Dental Inventory: The permanent dentition present consists of maxillary right and left I1, right C,
right PM1, left PM2, and right and left M1, M2, and M3. Mandibular teeth present include right
I2, right and left C, PM1, PM2, right M1, right and left M2, and M3.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: Moderate to heavy dental calculus is present on all
teeth. The dental calculus extends onto the root. Some calculus deposits extend half way up the
root. Postmortem damage to the enamel is evident on several molars. Small caries at the cemento­
enamel junction are on the mandibular right M1 and left M3, and maxillary right PM1.

50

Pathology: A healed lesion, probable sharp force trauma, is on the lateral side of the right tibia on
the acruate line. The healed lesion is 33.8 mm proximal-distal, 9.2 mm anterior-posterior, and
extends 5.1 mm from the bone.
Entheseal Changes: N/A

Burial 14
Burial 14 contains the remains of an adult male 55–60+ years of age. Transitional analysis indicates
a maximum likelihood of 76 years of age.
Burial 14 was west of Burial 13. The backhoe cut into this grave when scraping, and the left portion
of the skull and part of the left humerus were removed. The grave shaft was difficult to identify,
and only limited burial container wood was preserved. Small remnants of the container are present
on the west side, though it is faint. No container wood remained at the base or on the east half of
the container. Although the skull was crushed, the remaining skeletal elements were in good
condition, and thin copper plating, approximately 15 cm wide, ran across the chest from the left
distal humerus to the right shoulder. The copper plating is thin and crumbles when touched.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 220 cm SW/NE, 67 cm wide; depth 106.7 cm (3.5 feet)
to the top of the casket and approximately 121.9 cm (4.0 feet) to the bottom of the crushed casket.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: No
Wood Arch: No
Outer Box: No
Burial Container Description: Unable to determine; most of the container is unobservable.
Burial Container Painted: Unobservable
Viewing Window: No
Hardware: Yes
Mortuary Artifacts: 52 cut nails
Wood Preservation: Poor
Personal Items: Seven buttons of varying sizes and compositions were found across the grave.
Two Prosser buttons size 12 mm (18 lines) and one copper button 15 mm (24 lines) were located
at the right arm. Four additional buttons were found during screening. Two japanned bar buttons
are copper; one with a diamond-shaped pattern 15 mm (24 lines), and a second with no identifiable
design 15 mm (24 lines). Japanned buttons typically had black paint as the background to any
design. A third metal button of iron, the size of which could not be determined, and a hard rubber,
wedge shank button with an iron inlay design, size of 14 mm (22 lines), were also present.

51

Burial Position/Taphonomy: The burial is a single interment, articulated, and in an extended
position. The arms were semi-flexed with the hands crossed at the pelvic region.
Skeletal Preservation: Fair to Good
Sex: Probable male
Age-at-Death: 55–60+; transitional analysis suggests a maximum likelihood of 76 years
Stature: 176.8 cm ± 3.3 (5' 9.6")
Dental Inventory: Much of the facial bones, maxilla, and mandible were disturbed by the backhoe.
Only a few teeth were recovered, and it is not clear whether most were lost due to the scraping.
The teeth present are the right maxillary I1 and left M3.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: The right maxillary I1 has lingual grooving at the
cemento-enamel junction that extends on the crown and root. In the center of the groove is a
cemento-enamel junction carie. The lingual side of the tooth is also polished. Three vertical
grooves are on the labial side of the tooth extending almost to the cemento-enamel junction. Dental
calculus is present on I1 and M3, and M3 has a cemento-enamel junction carie on the buccal side
of the tooth.
Pathology: Schmorl’s nodes affect thoracic vertebrae 8, 9, and 10, and eburnation, porosity, and
lipping are present on the transverse process facet on ribs 8, 9, and 10. Three types of Schmorl’s
nodes are present. Thoracic 8 has inferior herniation of the nucleus pulposa with posterior crossing
of the annulus fibrosus. Thoracic 9 has inferior and superior herniation with postero-lateral
crossing of the annulus fibrosa. Thoracic 10 has superior herniation with posterior crossing and
inferior intraspongious herniation. Schmorl’s nodes occur with the vertebral column being
continuously flexed and bending laterally while lifting heavy objects. General stress, such as
farming, can result in these changes (Capasso et al. 1999:38).
Entheseal Changes: Eburnation and lipping greater than two-thirds of the circumference is present
on the head of the right and left femora, left and right semilunar notch with porosity, and the
surfaces of the distal tibiae, talus, and talar facet on the calcaneus. The left carpals have lipping on
all articular surfaces. The right and left femora exhibit an enlarged femoral head at the anteriorsuperior border convexity. Collapse of the calcaneus at the talar facet has led to the talus tilting
anteriorly and inferiorly into a cupped area of the calcaneus. The facet has depressed 2.3 mm. An
olecranon spur is present on the right olecranon process and extends 4.9 mm. The olecranon spur
is termed a woodcutters lesion by Capasso et al. (1999). This occurs when stress is placed on the
triceps brachii while the arm is being extended and flexed. Such changes have been found in
occupations such as woodcutting, quarrying, and blacksmithing.
The extension of the femoral head is consistent with an individual squatting or sitting cross-legged
(Capasso et al. 1999:103). It will occur with any activity requiring hyperdorsiflexion of the ankle
and hyperflexion of the knee and hip.

52

Burial 15
Burial 15 is the grave of a 4–7-month-old infant.
Burial 15 was one of the last burials excavated. The burial was shallow compared to most of the
other burials and was decorated with thumbscrews, tacks, copper sheeting, and a nameplate. The
nameplate reads “Our Darling.” Bioturbation and potential movement by the water table disturbed
the remains, resulting in the vertebrae found near the top of the skull and lower right area of the
burial. Fifteen to twenty mussel shell fragments and four whole mussel shells were encountered in
direct contact with the outer box. Shells were also found in the grave shaft above the burial between
the outer box and casket.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Oval; 95 cm SW/NE, 50 cm wide at the widest point; depth 109.7 cm
(3.6 feet) to the outer box outline and 131.1 cm (4.3 feet) of the base of the casket.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: Mussel shell fragments and whole mussel shell.
Wood Arch: No
Outer Box: Rectangular; 80 cm SW/NE, 35 cm headboard, 34 cm shoulders, and 34 cm footboard
Casket Description: Rectangular; 75 cm SW/NE, 20 cm headboard, 19 cm shoulders, 20 cm
footboard
Painted: No
Viewing Window: No
Hardware: Yes
Mortuary Artifacts: Wire nails, tacks, and copper sheeting. Thin copper sheets were at the chest
near the “Our Darling” nameplate.
Wood Preservation: Good
Personal Items: Three plain 1-mm (16 lines) Prosser buttons
Burial Position/Taphonomy: The remains were in fair to good condition. The infant was laid on
the back, though much of the remains were disarticulated or disturbed. The original position was
extended. The arms were disturbed and hand placement could not be identified.
Skeletal Preservation: Fair to Good
Sex: Unknown
Age-at-Death: 4–7 months
Stature: N/A

53

Dental Inventory: Little bone survived excavation due to friability. The teeth were in excellent
condition. No permanent teeth were located, though all but the right maxillary I1 and right
mandibular I2 were present. The left mandibular M1 and M2 were in the tooth crypt and thus no
measurements or other observations could be made.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: None observed
Pathology: None observed
Entheseal Changes: N/A

Burial 16
Burial 16 is the grave of an infant 32 weeks to term.
Burial 16 was found in the group of graves near the brick gate to the cemetery. The burial is at a
shallow depth, similar to the other infants at the cemetery. This burial was impacted by the
backhoe, with a small portion of the southwest end of the casket removed. The grave was dug into
sandy loam sediments. Differentiation between the arch, outer box and casket was the presence of
nails at the outer box. These nails were only found below the wood arch. The outer box and casket
could be differentiated due to the presence of the red paint on the casket, the presence of hardware,
and a small amount of sediment. The casket had collapsed and mounded over the remains.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 88 cm SW/NE to cut edge, 60 cm wide; depth 88.4 cm
(2.9 feet) to the outer box outline and 109.7 cm (3.6 feet) of the base of the casket.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: Mussel shell was in the fill directly on top of the arch. Nine large
complete clamshells and one fragment of a clamshell were placed directly on the arch lid. A small
fragment of orange pottery, similar to terracotta, was also placed on the bench. This pottery
matches the pottery fragments found in Burial 25.
Wood Arch: Rectangular; 88 cm to cut edge; 60 cm at headboard, shoulders, and footboard
Outer Box: Rectangular; 59 cm to cut edge, 29 cm at headboard, shoulders, and footboard
Casket Description: Rectangular; 59 cm to cut edge; width is indeterminate due to collapse of the
coffin lid.
Painted: Red
Viewing Window: No
Hardware: Yes
Mortuary Artifacts: Cut nails
Wood Preservation: Good

54

Personal Items: One safety pin 2.6 cm long and a straight pin 2.4 cm long.
Burial Position/Taphonomy: The remains were in fair to good condition. The long bones were
extremely friable; however, the vertebrae and metacarpals were in excellent condition. The body
was laid on the back in an extended position. Knees were semi-flexed with the arms tightly flexed.
Though the humeri, radii, and ulnae had fragmented to the point of being unidentifiable, the
metacarpals and phalanges of both hands were perfectly preserved, laying on the location of the
sternum indicating the hands were placed on the chest, and the arms were tightly flexed.
Skeletal Preservation: Poor to Good
Sex: Unknown
Age-at-Death: 32 weeks to term

Pathology: None observed
Entheseal Changes: N/A

Burial 17
Burial 17 is the grave of a child 4 ½ to 5 ½ years old.
Burial 17 contained a large casket thought to contain an adult based on its size. The grave was
located on the southernmost row of graves. Little sediment had to be removed to expose the lid of
the casket, suggesting no outer box was present. The casket was painted white. Due to the poor
condition of the remains, the bones and sediment had to be removed and screened. At some point,
the casket had filled with ground water because much of the remains were not articulated. The left
femur shifted toward the left side of the casket at an angle.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 140 cm SW/NE, 30 cm wide; depth 91 cm (3.0 feet) to
the casket outline and 109.7 cm (3.6 feet) of the base of the casket.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: None observed
Wood Arch: No
Outer Box: No
Casket Description: Rectangular; 134 cm to cut edge, 38 cm headboard, 36 cm shoulders, 32 cm
footboard.
Painted: White
55

Viewing Window: No
Hardware: Yes
Mortuary Artifacts: Cut nails
Wood Preservation: Good
Personal Items: Two plain Prosser buttons were present in the grave. A 12-mm (18 lines) button
was found during flotation from the skull area, and a second Prosser, 10 mm (16 lines), was at the
distal sternum.
Burial Position/Taphonomy: The remains were in poor condition, though it was evident the body
had been placed in an extended position on the back, with most of the remains articulated.
Skeletal Preservation: Poor to Fair
Sex: Unknown
Age-at-Death: 4 ½ to 5 ½ years
Stature: N/A
Dental Inventory: Deciduous and permanent dentition was present. Deciduous dentition includes
maxillary right and left M2, C, I2 and I2; and mandibular right and left M2, M1, and I1. Permanent
dentition exhibits no root development on any teeth, and the maxillary right and left M1, right I1,
and left PM1 are present; along with the mandibular right and left M1, and left PM1 and I1.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: One linear enamel hypoplasia was found at 4 mm from
the cemento-enamel junction. The age of insult for the hypoplasia is 2.7 years. Permanent
maxillary right I1 is shoveled, level 3.
Pathology: None observed
Entheseal Changes: N/A

Burial 18
Burial 18 is the grave of a child 3–5 years.
Burial 18 was one of the northernmost graves in the cemetery, next to the cemetery gates. The
casket was very large and adult-sized. The depth from the casket outline to exposing the arch was
40 cm, requiring a significant amount of sediment removal. Once removal of the overburden was
complete, groundwater inundated the grave shaft. Removal of the arch and casket lid did not
improve the situation. A wet/dry vacuum was used to remove the water and clay slurry to continue
exposure of the remains. The bottom of the burial was scraped to sterile to ensure no remains or
artifacts were present. The upper half of the burial, Areas A, B, and C, were sectioned into six
subareas. Each area was excavated separately, and the water and slurry screened independently,
56

with Areas A and B screened by the six subareas. Water infiltration due to the level of the water
table significantly disturbed the remains.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 170 cm SW/NE, 98 cm wide; depth 125 cm (4.0 feet)
to the arch outline and 173.7 cm (5.7 feet) to the base of the casket.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: None observed
Wood Arch: Rectangular; 148 cm SW/NE, 85 cm headboard, 90 cm shoulders, 72 cm footboard
Outer Box: No
Casket Description: Rectangular; 124 cm SW/NE, 40 cm headboard, 40 cm shoulders, 42 cm
footboard.
Painted: No
Viewing Window: No
Hardware: No
Mortuary Artifacts: Cut nails
Wood Preservation: Good
Personal Items: Numerous buttons were found in the burial. Subarea 5 produced the most, two
shell and five Prosser buttons. Subarea 6 had three buttons, two found during screening; two were
Prosser buttons and one was shell. Sizes in Subareas 5 and 6 were not collected. The three buttons
in Subarea 4 were two Prosser 15 mm (24 lines) and one two-hole shell that was fragmentary and
could not be measured. Another 15-mm (24 lines) Prosser button was in Subarea 3 and in Area A,
in the skull area. A single 10-mm (16 lines) button was found during screening.
Burial Position/Taphonomy: Water infiltrating the grave due to the water table levels shifted the
remains within the casket, displacing most remains to the southwest portion of the casket.
Skeletal Preservation: Fair to Good

Burial 19
Burial 19 is the grave of an adult, probably a male.
Burial 19 lay in the center of the cemetery. Wood preservation was excellent and the last plank of
the arch near the footboard was pulled out intact by the backhoe. The burial was deep and below
the water table. It was the deepest grave shaft in the cemetery. Water continually filled the grave,
requiring the use of a wet/dry vacuum to remove the water so the bones were visible. Given the
very sticky texture of the soil that created a situation in which small bones and any potential
personal items could not be left in situ, removal of as much of the water and sediment as possible
via wet-dry vacuum occurred. This proved to be an effective method for excavation; however,
water would quickly fill the grave and move smaller bones and teeth. The sediments and water
were removed per burial area: A, B, C, D, and E. Each area was screened separately. Due to the
thick, sticky clay and the fragmentary and friable condition of the skull, it was removed as a solid
mass and screened. Body length in the grave measured 171 cm. Most epiphyses of the long bones
are missing, precluding measurements.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 262 cm SW/NE, 125 cm wide; depth 122 cm (4.0 feet)
to the arch outline and 185.9 cm (6.1 feet) to the base of the casket.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: One glass bottle base was found in Area D, and one olive glass
fragment in Area A was near the top of the arch. The overburden contained a few (5–10) mussel
shell fragments, and fragments were also found close to the arch.
Wood Arch: Rectangular; 229 cm SW/NE, 89 cm headboard, 93 cm shoulders, 95 cm footboard.
Outer Box: No
Casket Description: Rectangular; 188 cm to cut edge, 55 cm headboard, 63 cm shoulders, 44 cm
footboard.

Burial Position/Taphonomy: Burial 19 is a single burial with the body placed on the back. Both
femora rolled laterally, with the femoral heads out of the sockets. The body was extended with the
arms flexed at the elbow, right hand at the waist, and left hand over the right hip. Cranial–foot
orientation was southwest to northeast, with the head in the southwest.
Skeletal Preservation: Fair to Good
Sex: Probable male
Age-at-Death: Adult
Stature: 171 cm (5' 7") based on body length in casket
Dental Inventory: Dentition includes maxillary left M3, right and left M2, M1, PM2, left P1, right
and left C, and left I1. Mandibular teeth present are right M3, right and left M2 and M1, right PM2
and PM1, and left I2.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: Most of the teeth present have moderate to heavy wear,
scoring 5 or higher. The molars exhibit moderate wear, scoring 2–5 per cusp. Interproximal caries
affect the mesial surface of the right maxillary C; distal mandibular left M1, and mesial M2.
Moderate levels of calculus are present on the molars and on the labial side of the first maxillary
incisor. Active periodontal disease affected the maxilla, though resorption was minor.
Pathology: Circumferential osteophytes are on the atlas facet. Eburnation is present without
porosity. Osteophytes on the left anterior body of lumbar 4, less than one-third, extend 8.3 mm.
Entheseal Changes: N/A

Burial 20
Burial 20 is the grave of a juvenile 7–9 years of age.
Burial 20 was dug below the current water table. Thirty centimeters of water flooded the grave
shaft. The remains are heavily disturbed within the casket. The left leg was completely
disarticulated with the femur across the chest, ribs shifted to the right side of the burial, and the
teeth scattered in areas A, B, and C. Few nails were observed in situ due to the mud and water.
The coffin wood was very well preserved.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 190 cm SW/NE, 78 cm wide; depth 131.1 cm (4.3 feet)
to the arch outline and 182.9 cm (6.0 feet) of the base of the casket.

Entheseal Changes: N/A

Burial 21
Burial 21 is the grave of a preterm infant 30 weeks to term, though no remains were preserved.
Age is based on casket length.
Burial 21 was east of Burials 13 and 14. Neither the wood nor the remains were well preserved,
and no remains were located, even during screening. The size of the grave shaft and the casket are
very small, and the lid of the casket did not survive. As with Burials 13 and 14, this grave was very
60

shallow with little overburden needing to be removed. The lack a lid was noted when a button was
encountered before casket wood. Two fragments of cloth were found at the footboard and were
photographed in the field.

Burial 22
Burial 22 is the grave of a male 45–55 years. Transitional analysis suggests a maximum likelihood
of 55.4 years.
Burial 22 was excavated from a grave shaft that was a large rectangle. The shaft was approximately
the bucket width of a backhoe, about 4 feet, and the initial assessment was that the area could be a
mass grave. Scraping only revealed the metal coffin. The discovery of the coffin occurred when
the backhoe clipped the lid at the headboard. The metal coffin was partially complete. The lower
half of the coffin was crushed toward the right side of the body, trapping the tibia and several tarsals
underneath the bent metal. Though the coffin was bent, it was able to be moved in one piece. It is
unknown if the viewing window broke during the initial damage to the coffin or when the backhoe
lifted the lid.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Irregular-rectangular; 212 cm SW/NE, 110 cm wide; Depth 79.2 cm
(2.6 feet) to the base of the grave shaft.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: Brick fragments, china bowl or teacup with pink decorations, and
white milk glass fragment similar to a vase.
Wood Arch: No
Outer Box: Unknown shape; the outer box was only observable on the east portion of the coffin
because of a thin wood outline and nails.
Coffin Description: Tapered; 184 cm SW/NE, 20 cm headboard, 54 cm shoulders, 20 cm
footboard. Coffin wall thickness measured at 9.3 mm.
Painted: No
Viewing Window: Ovoid, approximately 30 by 48 cm. The glass was 7.3 to 7.5 mm thick and had
a green tint.
Hardware: Metal coffin with viewing window. Twenty decorative lid fasteners closed the lid to
the base of the coffin. Six coffin handles adorned the coffin.
Mortuary Artifacts: Cut nails
Wood Preservation: Poor
Personal Items: One fragmented iron button was found during screening. Neither the style nor
markings could be identified.
Burial Position/Taphonomy: Semi-articulated and disturbed in an extended position. In situ
remains were extended, with the head at the southwest. Both arms were extended with the hands
at the thighs.
Skeletal Preservation: Fair to Good

62

Sex: Male
Age-at-Death: 45–55 years; transitional analysis 22–90 years with maximum likelihood of 55.4
years
Stature: 170.6 cm ± 4.1 cm (5' 7")
Dental Inventory: Preservation of the maxilla and mandible allowed observations of premortem
and postmortem loss. The following teeth were lost premortem, with the socket resorbing:
maxillary right and left M3, left M2, and M1, right I1 and left C, and right and left PM2 and PM1;
and mandibular left M1 and M2; right M3, M2, M1, left PM1, and right and left PM2, I2, and I1.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: Interproximal caries were most frequent. Access to
dental care is evident by the gold fillings in the left maxillary I1. Two caries, one mesial and one
distal, were filled; the mesial had a gold filling with the filling still present. Another type of metal,
possibly an amalgam, was in the right M1. Interproximal caries are in the mesial maxillary I2, right
mesial and distal I2, distal C; and mandibular distal C. A large occlusal carie resulted in destruction
of greater than one-third of the crown. Evidence of drilling or smoothing of the carie area was
absent on these teeth.
Pathology: Generalized physical stress is evident in the presence of Schmorl’s nodes on thoracic
vertebrae 9, 10, 11, and 12. Schmorl’s nodes are present on the superior and inferior body surfaces.
Thoracic 11 has an intra-canalar herniation with the herniation extending posterior. Herniation of
thoracic 10 extends postero-lateral. According to Capasso et al. (1999:38), this is the only type
capable of causing nerve root compression and pain.
Entheseal Changes: Pectoralis major and teres major have heavy musculoskeletal stress markers
at level 3.5. These lesions are resorptive. The brachioradialis origin, flexor pollicis longus origin,
brachialis insertion, and anconeus insertion have moderate (level 2 to 2.5) entheses.
Taphonomy: Rust from the metal coffin resulted in orange stains on the bone. Stains are spotty in
some areas, particularly on the innominates, creating a cheetah-like pattern.

Burial 23
Burial 23 contained no skeletal remains. Casket length suggests the individual was less than 13
months of age.
Burial 23 was in a row of infants. The grave shaft was irregular, and the initial outline of the casket
was very evident. As the overburden was removed, the casket wood outline ended after .5 cm. The
outline of the casket was identified by the placement of wire nails. The base of the grave was a
gravel clay base. Neither lid nor casket base was preserved. Age of the individual was based upon
the length of the casket.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Ovoid; 80 cm SW/NE, 39 cm wide; depth 91 cm (3 feet) to the casket
outline and 118.9 cm (3.9 feet) to the base of the grave

Burial 24
Burial 24 is the grave of a preterm infant 34–36 weeks to term.
Burial 24 was identified by a dark gray sediment that was not much larger than the arch. The arch
was painted white and warped 15 cm in depth from the original depth. Upon removal of the arch,
casket hardware, including tacks, nails, decorative covers, and “Our Darling” copper nameplate,
were exposed. The casket retained its shape except at the southwest corner. Small fragments of
fabric were recovered from the chest area, each less than .5 cm in diameter. The casket was painted
white, though wood near the sternum was painted brown. Copper fragments whose shape could
not be determined were near the footboard. Remains had completely decayed and no fragments
were recovered during screening.

Burial 25
Burial 25 is the grave of a male 25–30 years of age.
Burial 25 was located southwest of Burial 16. The wood arch warped until it contacted the casket
lid. The depth created from the warping required the use of a shovel to remove overburden.
Overburden removal took approximately 3 hours. Though the wood was in poor condition, the lid
65

had fused to the bottom of the casket and adhered to the skeletal elements. Once the lid was
separated from the base of the casket, the remains were easily exposed. Skeletal elements were
black metallic in color and had an opalescent sheen in the spongy bone; the origin of these changes
is unclear. The femora had rolled laterally, and the pubic symphyses were easily observed with the
left well preserved. Infield analysis of age occurred before any potential damage. Although the
remains appeared to be in good condition, the posterior side of the bone in contact with the wood
base had flattened and melded into the casket base. Thus, the posterior one-quarter of the skeletal
elements was flat. Clear and brown glass fragments were in the grave shaft fill, just above the arch,
along with a fragment of orange pottery similar to terra cotta. This pottery matches the piece found
in Burial 16. Both of these graves are next to each other.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 225 cm SW/NE, 95 cm wide. Depth approximately
91.4 cm (3 feet) to the casket outline and 167.6 cm (5.5 feet) to the base of the grave.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: Brown glass fragment, clear glass fragment, orange terra cotta-like
pottery. All close to the arch.
Wood Arch: Rectangular; 196 cm SW/NE, width very irregular.
Outer Box: No
Casket Description: Rectangular; unable to determine exact dimensions.
Painted: No
Viewing Window: No
Hardware: No
Mortuary Artifacts: 63 nails and screws
Wood Preservation: Fair
Personal Items: Personal items consisted of nine Prosser and bone buttons. One dish type 14-mm
(22 lines) Prosser button was found during screening. A 10-mm (16 lines) Prosser button was
located each at the neck and left wrist, and a 13-mm (20 lines) button was located on the right hip.
Two four-hole bone 16.5-mm (22 lines) buttons were on the right hip, and one was on the left. Two
four-hole bone buttons, 16.5 mm (26 lines), were in area B. The bone buttons had a divot at the
location of a fifth hole instead of a fully drilled hole.
Burial Position/Taphonomy: In situ single interment with very little movement of remains and
personal items. The articulated remains were extended with the arms semi-flexed and hands
crossed at the chest. Some of the remains in the chest area were disturbed, and the head of the left
humerus was at the right wrist, which was still in situ. The head was rotated to the left.
Skeletal Preservation: Fair to Good
Sex: Male

66

Age-at-Death: 25–30 years
Stature: Approximately 178 cm (5' 10")
Dental Inventory: Maxillary right M3, right and left OM1, right C, right and left I2 and I1.
Mandibular right M3, M2, M1, right and left PM2, right PM1, and right and left I2.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: Level 8 wear affected the right and left mandibular I2.
The maxillary I1 had wear that affected the medial portion of the tooth that was scooped, indicative
of artifact use or production.
Pathology: The right distal, third ulnar shaft has healed greenstick fractures. The distal first foot
phalange has woven bone and osteophytes extending on the inferior surface forming a bridge from
the proximal articular facet to the tip.
Entheseal Changes: Both femora have a mesa-like linea aspera, pilasterism. This may be the result
of activities of flexor stress during lifting from a squatting position (Capasso et al. 1999:118).
Developmental Defects: The second and third neural arch of the sacrum exhibit aplasia. The
second neural arch completely failed to develop, leaving a hole, and the three failed to develop,
though the bone fused.

Burial 26
Burial 26 is the grave of a probable female aged 40–55 years. Transitional analysis indicates a
maximum likelihood of 55.2 years.
Burial 26 is an arch burial excavated to beneath the current water table. Water continually filled
the casket, requiring removal using the wet/dry vacuum. Sterile soil was visible between the arch
and the casket lid, though the layer was thin. The femora are in anatomical position; however,
taphonomic processes resulted in the distal tibiae being upside down, with the tibial tuberosity
facing the base of the grave. Both the left and right bones of the feet were comingled in the left
portion of the grave. The thick clay sediments made it difficult to excavate the remains.
Although the presence of a buckle suggests this individual is male, the greater sciatic notch and
distal humeral epicondyle measurement are scored as probable female. The biepicondylar score is
1.6, cutoff 1.51, and the articular width score is 1.81, cutoff 1.51, which both clearly indicate
female.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 212 cm SW/NE, 82 cm wide. Depth, 118.9 cm (3.9
feet) to the arch outline and 182.9 cm (6 feet) to the base of the grave. Arch outline to top of warped
arch was 47 cm.
Items of Note in Grave Fill: Brown and blue glass bottle fragments. The blue glass was the base
of a wine bottle.
Wood Arch: Rectangular; 212 cm SW/NE, 81 cm headboard, 81 cm shoulders, 78 cm footboard.

missing and any observable bone was fully resorbed.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: N/A
Pathology: The left fourth metacarpal has a fully healed greenstick fracture on the palmar side.
Entheseal Changes: Eburnation and spicule formation are present on the atlas dens facet and on
the dens of the axis. The right talus, on the proximal edge of the inferior facet, has a large
osteophyte extending 10 mm.
Burial 27
Burial 27 is the grave of 3–5-month-old infant.
Burial 27 was found when scraping to remove the concrete crypt, Burial 6. No depth was taken
because the grave had to be removed before the surveyor arrived. The grave lid had collapsed on
the bone, and the bone was difficult to identify since it was stained the same color as the wood.
Bones were friable and crumbled when excavating.

Burial 28
Burial 28 is the grave of 3–5-year-old child.
Burial 28 was identified during the overburden removal retained due to the presence of Burials 27,
29, 30, and 31. The burial was excavated below the modern water table and water continually filled
the burial. A rainstorm exacerbated this situation. Due to the poor condition of the bone and poor
visibility, the remains were removed in bulk and water-screened.

Dental Inventory: Deciduous maxillary right M2 and M1 and left M2. Deciduous right and left
M2 and M1. Permanent teeth include developing maxillary right and left M2 and M1, left PM1,
and right C and I1. Mandibular partially developed teeth include mandibular right and left M1,
right M2, and left PM1 and I1.
Dental Pathology/Anomalies/Modification: A large occlusal carie is on the deciduous right
maxillary M2. Large caries destroyed half of the crown of the deciduous right and left mandibular
M2, and the complete crown M1, leaving root exposure. Linear horizontal pits on deciduous left
M2 buccal side are carious. Numerous linear enamel hypoplasia are evident on the teeth with
maxillary right I1 having three. Ages of insults are 1.3, 2.1, and 3.1 for I1; 3.5 and 3.8 years for
the right maxillary C; 5.0 for the left maxillary PM1; and 1.24 for the mandibular left I1. These
insults indicate a regular pattern of stress occurring around 1.3, 2, 3, 3.5, 4, and 5 years of age. The
many insults on the health of this young child may be correlated to the young age-at-death.

Burial 29
Burial 29 is the grave of a fetus aged 32–38 weeks.
Burial 29 was identified during the overburden removal retained due to the presence of Burials 27,
28, 30, and 31. The burial had to be excavated before the surveyor was able to take the depths, so
it was measured from the top of the concrete crypt, Burial 6. The footboard and headboard folded
toward the center and first appeared to be the base of the casket. Large amounts of oyster shell and
clamshell were on the arch. The arch warped east to west as it sank toward the casket. Due to the
preservation and sediment texture, the contents of the burial were removed in bulk and waterscreened to retrieve the bones of the infant.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 60 cm SW/NE, 35 cm wide. The depth to the top of the
coffin was approximately 106.7 cm (3.5 feet) and 112.8 cm (3.7 feet) to the base.

Burial 30
Burial 30 is the grave of an infant age 6 months to 1 year.
Burial 30 was identified during the overburden removal at Burial 9 while trying to remove the
concrete and brick crypt, Burial 6. This burial was almost directly under Burial 9 and may have
been impacted when the grave shaft for Burial 9 was dug. The burial had to be excavated before
the surveyor was able to take the depths. The coffin lid was heavily warped, with the wood in fair
to poor condition. Excavation revealed the coffin was larger than it appeared because the walls had
collapsed; the headboard was absent. Nails and screws were unusually large for this size of grave
shaft. The remains were heavily disturbed.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 98 cm SW/NE, 38 cm wide. The depth was not
determined due to the need to excavate the burial before the arrival of the surveyor. However, the
depth of the lid approximates the base of Burial 9.

Burial 31
Burial 31 contained no remains. Age estimation is based on casket length that indicated the
individual was no older than 10 months at death.
Burial 31 was in the cluster of child and infant graves surrounding the concrete crypt (Burial 6).
The burial had to be excavated before the surveyor was able to take the depths so it was measured
from the top of the concrete crypt, Burial 6. The casket was poorly preserved and may have been
impacted by Burial 6. Shell concentrations helped define the grave shaft outline. The grave was

Burial 32
Burial 32 contained the remains of an infant aged 35–40 weeks.
Burial 32 was a child-sized casket with a slightly tapered shape. The grave shaft was only slightly
larger than the size of the casket, extending approximately 5 cm on each side of the casket. Shell
was on the lid of the casket, and the lid had collapsed with only 0.5–3 cm between the base of the
casket and the lid. Skeletal elements were poorly preserved and easily fragmented. Due to the soil
texture, photographs could not be taken of the remains because they were not visible. Mapping
also proved difficult due to the high fragmentation of the remains.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 104 cm SW/NE, 41 cm wide. The depth to the top of

Burial 33
Burial 33 contained the remains of an infant aged 35–40 weeks.
Burial 33 lid had slumped approximately 10–15 cm from the edge of the casket outline encountered
during scraping. A shell layer, approximately 6–12 cm thick, was on top of the casket lid. The lid
and base of the casket were fused, but the wood was well preserved and the alternating grains of
the wood and wood planks were evident. A gravelly subsoil matrix was on the west side of the
casket, with the dark organic soil on the east suggesting the casket lay directly against the grave
shaft in the west. The casket was larger than needed for the size of the child. Though the remains
were in fair to good preservation, they were tightly fused to the wood. Femora were fused to the
wood and were measured in the field before removal. Similar to other remains in the cemetery,
these were black and had a shiny metallic subsistence adhering to them.
Burial Shaft Size and Depth: Rectangular; 128 cm SW/NE, 53 cm wide. The depth to the top of
the casket was 94.5 cm (3.1 feet) and 149.4 cm (4.9 feet) to the base.

fragments less than 2 inches long and 0.1 inches in diameter were found under the casket lid on the
remains. Similar fragments were found in an infant burial at the Roberts Cemetery in Bell County
(McWilliams and Whitley 2014). These fragments of wire are interpreted as floral wire. During
the Victorian-era it was customary to place flowers in the caskets surrounding the body and pinned
to the casket lid (McWilliams and Whitley 2014:45). These wires could also be interpreted as
rickrack: “Rickrack is a term adopted during fieldwork to describe a form of filigree trim that
occurred in a serpentine motif of copper wire mesh underlain by a finely woven fabric, indicating
a cloth-covered coffin” (Ubelaker and Jones 2003:10).

Burial 34
Burial 34 contained the remains of a 30-week fetus.
Burial 34 has a child-sized casket with a bench. Shell was present on the top of the bench. The
bench was thin and warped inward until touching the casket lid, and the casket lid collapsed onto
the base. Two to three centimeters of sediment lay between the bench and the casket lid. The
petrous length is 24.3 mm. Fetal measurements on length as reported in Schaefer (2009:22) range
from 19.1–25 mm. The length of Burial 34 does not fall outside the 30-week age estimate.

SECTION 6
BIOARCHEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

This chapter discusses the osteological analyses of 35 individuals from Campbell’s Bayou
Cemetery and compares the results with other cemetery populations from across the nation.
Osteological and mortuary summaries of each individual were presented in Chapter 5. Individuals
interred at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery resided in a small community listed as Virginia Point on
the 1860 census (1860 Census, M593 Roll 1294, census pages 434). However, the individuals
interred in Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery are not a representation of the population at Virginia Point
because burial at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery was limited to family members and a few members
of the community, based on records of known interments at the cemetery. Pathological
comparisons with the 1870 and 1880 mortality schedules for Galveston are used to understand how
health and mortality at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery vary with the community at large.
Comparisons with other historic cemetery populations also provide a larger historic context that
contribute to understanding life in the late nineteenth century.

Sex
Sex estimation was based on os coxae and cranial morphology outlined in Buikstra and Ubelaker
(1994). Metric sex estimations were also employed when possible and used as a substitute when
morphological characteristics were unavailable. New research indicates that postcranial elements
surpass using the skull for sex estimation and are preferred if the pelvis is missing or too
fragmentary for observation (Spradley and Jantz 2011). Metric analysis also provides an objective
rather than subjective method for estimating sex. Humeral biepicondylar width was often used
since this bone more often survived than others at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery; France’s regression
formulae are available in Bass (2005). As well, vertical diameter of the femoral head was compared
with diameter data in Bass (2005) to estimate sex.

Age
Multiple methods were used to estimate age-at-death since skeletal element preservation varied
widely at the site. Methods included auricular surface age-changes (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994),
pubic symphyseal changes (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994), epiphyseal closure, dental crown and
root development via measurements, length of the bars basilaris, pars lateralis (Schaefer et al.
2009), and coffin/casket and grave shaft length (Condon et al. 1998; Whitley 2012). Coffin/casket
and grave shaft length was only used with small caskets and in instances with no preserved human
remains or dentition.

Dentition
Dental data were collected according to standards in Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994). Visual
recording included presence, development, wear, caries, calculus deposits, and hypoplasia. Teeth
not fully developed were measured for use in aging the individuals. Caries development, location,
79

and extent were recorded for each tooth, and calculus deposits were coded by location and extent.
Hypoplasia (i.e., lines or pits visible in tooth enamel that developed during tooth formation) was
recorded according to the color, type, and distance from the cemento-enamel junction. Hypoplasia
age-at-insult was also calculated to determine the frequency and age at which stress occurred, using
regression formulae found in Goodman and Rose (1990). Different regression formulae are used
on each type of tooth and location. For example, a permanent maxillary first incisor has a different
formula from a mandibular first incisor. A 10X lens was used to identify hypoplasia.

Stature
Stature estimates were calculated from regression formula in Trotter and Glesser (1958). Femora
were preferred for estimating stature; Trotter and Glesser (1958:119–120) indicate the femor more
highly correlates with stature than upper limb bones. However, most bones were incomplete with
the epiphyses damaged or missing and long bone shafts fractured. To estimate stature, it was
necessary to take measurements of small sections of the bone based on landmarks termed segments.
These segment measurements can be used to reconstruct the skeletal element length or used directly
to estimate stature if multiple segments can be measured. Regression formulae for estimating
stature, based on individual elements or segments, can be found in Steele and Bramblett (1988).

Pathology
Pathological changes were scored for each skeletal element with observable changes. Observations
on the type of changes, such as woven bone, periostitis, osteophyte size and location, and
degenerative joint disease, were recorded in narrative form. Diagnostic interpretations were not
made at the time of observation. These are provided in the following narrative. Schmorl’s nodes
were scored according to presence/absence and location on the vertebral body. All pathological
changes were analyzed using a 10X microscope or lens. Infant and premature skeletons were
generally fragmentary, with epiphyses in a state of better preservation than the bone shaft. Their
condition prevented observation of pathological changes.

Entheseal Changes—Musculoskeletal Markers
Entheseal changes (changes to the bone caused by muscular activity of the tendons and ligaments),
known as musculoskeletal stress markers, were scored according to methods defined by Molnar
(2006) and Hawkey and Merbs (1995). Scores ranged from 0–3.5: no expression was recorded as
a 0 score, uneven pitting or furrowing as 1, well-defined change with pitting and rugged appearance
as 2, and extensive and clearly defined crest, ridge, irregular surface or any combination of these
as 3 (Molnar 2006). Half steps, 0.5, were used to give better clarity of the subtle changes. Insertion
and origin points for varying muscles in the axial skeleton, arms, legs, and hands were scored on a
form designed by Dr. Whitley.

DISCUSSION OF THE CAMPBELL’S BAYOU CEMETERY BURIALS
Thirty-five individuals were excavated from thirty-four graves at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery.
Eleven of the graves contained adults and twenty-four were children, infants, and fetuses.
Osteological interpretations for those in the cemetery are discussed below. An individual-by­
individual discussion is not provided, except in some areas where changes of the skeleton are
significant enough to warrant description.

Caries
Dental caries provide information regarding a population’s access to certain types of food and the
availability of dental care. Caries are a disease that results in demineralization of the tooth enamel
due to food particles and plaque and result in opaque spots or large cavities (Roberts and
Manchester 1995). Access to refined sugars, sucrose, fine flours, carbohydrates, and processed
sticky foods increased caries rates in the latter half of the nineteenth century.
Enamel defects, such as hypoplasia, have a known association with the prevalence of dental caries
due to the weakened enamel at these defects. Caries associated with enamel defects are termed
“circular caries” (Larsen 1997). Larsen (1997) discusses several case studies in which circular
caries are associated with an over-reliance on carbohydrates, poor water quality, consumption of
high starchy diets with weaning, excessive fluoride intake, and nutrient deficiencies.
Evidence of dental care accessible to the individuals buried at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery is
apparent by the presence of fillings. Dental work was quite expensive and usually only the wealthy
could afford this kind of care. Diseased teeth were more likely to be extracted than restored (Sutter
1995). With enough funds, tooth restoration was possible using gold, amalgam, tin, and other
metals. Gold fillings were the longest-lasting filling and were preferred, though it had to be
pounded into cavities. A tin, lead, and bismuth mixture was melted at 212 degrees Fahrenheit and
poured while still hot into the tooth. Amalgam fillings were the most popular because of their
hardness, longevity, and ability to be placed where it was difficult to insert gold (Glenner and
Willey 1998). These were a mixture of silver, tin, and mercury and would oxidize in the mouth.
Caries prevalence was only counted in children above 1 year of age due to the inconsistencies of
teeth present in the grave, in addition to the issue that most teeth would not have erupted and had
an opportunity to be exposed to dental disease resulting in caries. Fourteen individuals over 1 year
of age had teeth present for observation of dental caries. Nine of the 14 individuals had at least one
dental carie, with caries highest in Burial 5 (Table 2). Though nine of the 14 individuals had caries,
a calculation of carious teeth to observed teeth is necessary to clarify the carie rate. Of the observed
249 teeth, 53 had caries comprising 21 percent of the total tooth count (Burials 33 and 24 were not
included in the tooth count). The majority of the caries were interproximal caries. Two burials of
note due to the high prevalence of caries are Burials 5 and 22. Burial 5, a 9–11-year-old, had more
carious lesions than any other individual in the cemetery. Of the 30 observed teeth, 24 had
interproximal caries that were most prevalent on the incisors, canines, and premolars. The pulp is
exposed by the complete destruction of the crown into the root in the right and left mandibular first
molars. The right mandibular second incisor has lost a quarter of the crown to a carie and a second
carie is at the cemento-enamel junction. The second highest rate was in Burial 22. This individual
not only had a high rate of caries, with seven of 10 teeth affected, but was also the only individual

with dental work. The lingual lateral biting edge of the right maxillary first incisor had a gold
filling. This carie appeared to be filled by the method where a ball of gold is placed in the tooth
and hammered into place. On the lateral side of the tooth was a smoothed carie suggesting it had
been filled with gold though the filling was lost. The buccal portion of the maxillary right first
molar was missing, revealing an amalgam filling. Interproximal caries are on the maxillary right
and left second incisors, and right mandibular premolar lacked dental care. Gold fillings are very
rarely found in archeological excavations, with Little et al. (1992) reporting they found one gold
filling in 6,604 teeth.

Calculus
Dental calculus, or plaque, is a matrix that adheres to the teeth. It is composed of saliva, food
particles, proteins, and organisms and develops closest to the salivary glands (Roberts and
Manchester 1995). Recent research by Warriner (2012) found that pathogenic bacteria from the
nasal passages and bacteria from the upper respiratory tract and gut systems are detectable in the
calculus. Since these food particles and bacteria are trapped in the calculus, it can be used to garner
very specific information about diet, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, and DNA of the
individual.
Calculus deposits increase with a softer diet. Diets low in sugars and increased carbohydrate
consumption lead to calculus deposits whereas sugary diets and starchy foods encourage carie
development (Hillson 1996). Thus, the diet of molasses, salted bacon, corn bread, coffee, beans,
and sweet potatoes consumed by most Texans in the late nineteenth century should result in a lower
rate of calculus deposits.
82

As expected, calculus deposits were infrequent in Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery individuals. Four
of the 17 individuals with observable teeth had minor calculus deposits. Burial 13 had very heavy
calculus deposits with some crowns unobservable. The heavy deposits and few caries (3/23 teeth)
suggests this individual had a diet higher in carbohydrates than others buried in the cemetery.
Unfortunately, this individual could only be labeled as “adult,” precluding an assessment of the
years of accumulation. The presence of the thick deposits also suggests dental care was not
available to or not used by this individual.

Hypoplasia
Dental hypoplasias are indicators of stress that occur during development. These record a
chronological record of stress episodes, and the defects are areas of decreased enamel thickness
resulting in pits, linear or vertical lines, and furrows (Lewis 2007). Hypoplasia can occur on
deciduous teeth, indicating stress during fetal growth. More typically observed is hypoplasia in
permanent teeth. Permanent teeth develop between birth and 7 years of age, and the highest number
of lines peak from 3 to 4 years of age (Lewis 2007). Malnutrition and illness are the two categories
of stress, though the exact etiology is unknown (Roberts and Manchester 1995). Illness-associated
stress includes high fevers, such as ear infections, measles, typhoid, and cholera, and other
childhood diseases. Defects occurring between 2 and 4 years if age may be related to weaning as
the associated child loses the protective immunity provided during nursing. Significant to the
period at which Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery was in use, children were adjusting to contaminated
water supplies and the unfiltered water available to the inhabitants of Virginia Point. Additionally,
the quality of food may have been lowered for these children as a result of a reduction in protein
and other nutrients provided by the mother’s milk, resulting in malnutrition. Causes of
malnutrition, however, do not necessarily indicate a decrease in the quantity of calorie intake and
can occur due to the lack of specific vitamins (e.g., lack of B12, D, C, and niacin that result in
rickets, anemia, scurvy, and pellagra). Dysentery/bowel diseases can also prevent absorption of
these vitamins. The presence of hypoplasia in children and adults reflects the individual’s ability
to survive these insults; however, hypoplasia correlates to the deceased’s life expectancy (Lewis
2007).
Formulae in Goodman and Rose (1990) were used to calculate the age of insult. The hypoplasia
location was measured from the cemento-enamel junction to the hypoplasia, and age of insult was
calculated from this measurement. At Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, hypoplasia presence occurred
in children between 4 ½ to 11 years of age (see Table 2). No adults showed the insults. Hypoplasia
was recorded in Burials 5, 11, 17, 20, and 28. In each except Burial 17, multiple insults were
present, with Burial 5 having the highest number—a total of 25 insults—with hypoplasia affecting
18 of the 30 teeth present. In Burial 5, the first insult occurred at the age of 1.2 years and the last
at 5 years. Recurrent insults are present at the ages of approximately 1 year, 2 years, 2 years 7
months, 3 years 6 months, 4 years 8 months, 5 years 2 months, 5 years 7 months, indicating an
almost continuous onslaught of illness or malnutrition throughout this individual’s life until death
at approximately 9–11 years old. Burial 11 insults occurred at 1 year 8 months, 2 years 10 months,
and 4 years 3 months. This indicates regular intervals if sickness and malnutrition before death at
5–7 years of age. Burial 17 had only one insult at approximately 2 years 8 months, suggesting
issues with weaning. This individual died between 4 years 6 months and 5 years 6 months.
Multiple insults occurred in Burial 20 at the ages of 2 years, 2 years 10 months, 3 years 6 months,
4 years, and 4 years 6 months. The last individual with hypoplasia buried at Campbell’s Bayou
Cemetery is Burial 28. These insults occurred at approximate ages of 1 year 3 months, 2 years, 3
83

years, 3 years7 months, and 5 years. The numerous insults in Burials 5, 11, 20, and 28 suggest
continual stress of either malnutrition or illnesses. Hypoplasia at ages 1 and 2 suggest episodes of
illness since they may have still been nursing at this age, though illness is always potential.
Weaning is probably the cause for insults at approximately 3 years of age. Given the high rates of
infectious disease in the late nineteenth century, insults at 4 and 5 years most likely related to
illness.
The high rates of hypoplasia in the individuals between 3 and 11 years suggest these individuals
were able to survive numerous bouts of insults to their health. Those of a younger age not
displaying any hypoplasia or cribra orbitalia and other pathological indicators of disease and
malnutrition likely succumbed to a disease, such as cholera, ear infection, scarlet fever, or a host
of childhood diseases very quickly. Such insults evidenced by the hypoplasia indicate these
individuals may have had a rather robust immune system that was worn down through time,
resulting in frailty to the immune system and early death. Since none of these children had evidence
of trauma or malnutrition, they probably survived numerous ear infections, weanling diarrhea, high
fevers, cholera, small pox, dysentery, pneumonia, etc., before succumbing to the last onslaught of
disease. Adults with no hypoplasia and pathological changes to the skeletal elements consistent
with malnutrition and disease were also probably subjected to the same insults as those who died
as infants and juveniles. The absence does not necessarily indicate this individual was continuously
healthy throughout the lifetime.

Degenerative Joint Disease, Schmorl’s Nodes, and Entheseal Changes
Degenerative joint disease is one of the most recognizable pathologic changes on the skeleton.
These changes are chronic and develop due to aging and mechanical insults resulting in joint
destruction, formation, or a combination of both. Degenerative joint diseases are classified as
rheumatic diseases (Schumacher 1988) and are segmented into four categories: neuromechanical,
inflammatory, immune, and metabolic (Roberts and Manchester 1995). The most commonly
encountered class of neuromechanical rheumatic diseases encountered in the archeological record
is osteoarthritis. Criteria for identifying osteoarthritis include the presence of osteophytes, bone
spurs, and joint space narrowing. Obesity, occupational trauma to the joint, increasing age, and
lifestyle can all influence the presence and extent of this neuromechanical joint disease (Larsen
1997; Roberts and Manchester 1995; Schumacher 1988). The prevalence of osteoarthritis is known
to increase with age. Inflammatory, immune, and metabolic forms are less frequently reported in
the archeological literature. Of these, incidences of inflammatory arthritis, including rheumatoid
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, spondylarthropathies, and psoriatic arthritis, are more frequently
noted.
Neuromechanical changes at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery were present in most adults in at least
one category; shoulder, wrist, hip, knee, ankle, and vertebrae. Juveniles were not included in the
frequencies of degenerative joint disease since none exhibited signs of juvenile arthritis or other
degenerative diseases. Articular surfaces and epiphyses of the long bones were poorly preserved
at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery. Even though many of the elements were removed with little
damage, in many instances the epiphyses and elements with thick spongy bone were highly friable
and typically crumbled during excavation or during removal of the remains. As a result,
frequencies of degenerative joint disease within Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery are not calculated.

84

Schmorl’s nodes are intravertebral disc herniations of the nucleus pulposa and are expressed in
three males. Typically asymptomatic, these herniations can invade the intervertebral disc space
(Capasso et al. 1999; Hasegawa et al. 2004). Herniation with postero-lateral crossing is the only
type of Schmorl’s node that can cause compression of the nerve roots and pain (Capasso et al.
1999). Heavy labor associated with lateral bending and flexion of the vertebral column or trauma
is a factor argued to cause the development of the Schmorl’s nodes (Haswgawa et al. 2004).
The age-at-death for the population has two peaks; one in early childhood and another at 50 years
and older. Those 50 years and older comprise 19 percent (6 of 32) of the skeletal remains complete
enough for aging. As expected, degenerative changes in the form of osteoarthritis affected all
individuals. Vertebral osteoarthritis was the most common finding in all of the observable adult
remains. Only a few individuals with significant osteoarthritic changes, Schmorl’s nodes, and
entheseal changes will be discussed in depth because they have the most extensive changes.
Burial 1, a male aged 50–60 years, had degenerative changes consistent with an older individual at
the vertebral column, wrists, and ankles. The majority of the musculoskeletal stress markers were
robust, which is characteristic of an older individual or developed from heavy labor. Large
osteophytes on vertebrae thoracic 11 and lumbar 5, without presence of osteophytes on adjacent
vertebrae, suggest trauma led to the development of osteophytes. One osteophyte extended 9.9 mm
from the body of the vertebrae. In addition to the osteoarthritis, Schmorl’s nodes occur on the
superior portion of the bodies of vertebrae lumbar 1 and thoracic 9, 10, 11, and 12. Trauma to the
neck and the presence of Schmorl’s nodes, which are also caused by trauma, suggest this individual
was subjected to one or more accidents or traumatic events. Trauma to the cervical is consistent
with the Porter’s Neck of Levy that can manifest as compression fractures. Evidence of a
compression fracture is the fusion of cervical vertebrae 3 and 4, with compression greater on the
left transverse process, collapse of the left facets of cervicals 5 and 6, and macroporosity and sharp
lipping on the first thoracic vertebra. Porter's Neck of Levy occurs from twisting of the neck while
the head is immobilized or from compression of the vertebrae from force pressing down on the top
of the head (Capasso et al. 1999).
Burial 2 is a male, categorized as an older adult. The bones are friable, leaving little to analyze.
The left acetabulum has lipping, porosity, and the development of sclerotic bone on the lateral edge.
On the sternal facet of the right clavicle, a sclerotic area of bone, measuring 9.6 mm medial-lateral
and 8.3 mm anterior-posterior, is present. The sternal facet also extends on the anterior edge. Both
the right and left olecranons have changes consistent with “woodcutters” exostoses. These are
present on the posterior-superior surfaces of the left and right olecranon process. The right is more
developed than the left, with the left having minimal development of the exostoses. Woodcutting,
blacksmithing and baseball playing are associated with this entheseal extension. These activities
involve stress on the triceps brachii insertion during flexion and extension with maximum stress
when the arm is horizontal, flexed elbow, and working at full force (Capasso et al. 1999:78).
General hypertrophy of the right and left humerus suggests general habitual stress on this bone
could have been extreme. This male had changes consistent with someone chopping wood or doing
similar movements for an occupation or general tasks at home.
Burial 22 is the grave of a male aged 45–55 years of age and was buried in a cast iron coffin. The
lack of evidence of degenerative joint disease in the long bones, hip, and clavicles is due to the
fragmentary condition of the joints. However, other observations of vertebral trauma and
musculoskeletal stress markers on the long bones could be performed. In addition to the
osteoarthritis, Schmorl’s nodes occur on thoracic vertebrae 9, 10, 11, and 12, including an intra­
85

canalar herniation and a herniation extending postero-lateral. According to Capasso et al.
(1999:38), the postero-lateral herniation is the only type capable of causing nerve root compression
and pain. The presence of Schmorl’s nodes suggests this individual was subjected to trauma and/or
performed heavy labor at some point during his lifetime. Enthesopathies, useful to infer
musculoskeletal stress markers, of the pectoralis and teres major are scored at the highest
robusticity, which is indicted by resorptive lesions. In addition, the brachioradialis origin, flexor
pollicis longus origin insertion, and anconeus insertion are scored as moderate. Unfortunately, the
costo-clavicular ligament attachment was not available for observation. The changes associated
with the pectoralis major and Schmorl’s nodes are consistent with an individual who worked aboard
a ship as a sailor or fisherman who frequently rowed boats. These changes are seen on sailors of
the Mary Rose and an individual from the Roman period city of Iader (Novak et al. 2013). Thus,
the potential exists that this individual was a sailor, which would not be unexpected given the
history of Virginia Point and its inhabitants.
Burial 8 is the grave of a male aged 25–31. Systemic degenerative joint disease affects this
individual. Eburnation, minor to moderate circumferential lipping, and pinpoint and coalesced
porosity are present on most of the articular surfaces in varying combinations. In particular, these
changes are seen on the temporo-mandibular fossa, dens and dens facets, distal epiphysis of the
femora and femoral head, right patella, all tarsals, and proximal and medial metatarsals, in
particular the first proximal phalange, calcaneus, and talus. Neither medial clavicle has fused and
the left flake has a large resorptive indentation in the center. General humeral hypertrophy is
indicated by moderate to heavy entheseal changes; the pectoralis major could not be scored.
Hypertrophy of the costal tubercle, or costal syndesmosis, lateral robusticity are present on both
clavicles. These entheseal changes are consistent with carrying heavy loads in both hands while
the arm is extended and general stress on the pectoral girdle with the shoulders bent forward
(Capasso et al. 1999). These were also found in individuals from the Mary Rose crew whose
rigorous duties included tasks such as repairing canvas masts, use of long bows, and moving
cannons (Capasso et al. 1999:52).
Though the entheseal changes indicate heavy labor, the symmetrical, systemic osteoarthritis is
probably not caused by the same factors resulting in the musculoskeletal stress markers. These
systemic changes are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, differential diagnoses
such as psoriatic arthritis, gout, and osteoarthritis must be considered (Roberts and Manchester
2005). RA is a “chronic, systemic, inflammatory disorder characterized by the manner in which it
involves joints” (Schumacher 1988:83). The joints affected include those of the hands, wrists,
knee, shoulders, and elbows, though not the distal interphalangeal joints. The most commonly
involved are the hand, wrist, knee, and foot. The temporomandibular joint can also be involved
but is less common than other joints (Schumacher 1988). Resnick and Niwayama state that the
onset of the disease typically occurs between 25 and 55 years of age (see Ortner 2003). Occupation
based on the entheseal changes suggests this individual performed tasks, including but not limited
to, carrying heavy loads with both hands and suggests this individual may have performed duties
of a sailor. However, the symmetric joint changes and as well as the joints affected indicate he also
would have had rheumatoid arthritis and suffered from stiffness, fatigue, fever, and weight loss.
Degenerative joint disease in Burial 14, a male 55–60+ years, is similar to that found in Burial 8.
Bilateral eburnation and lipping is present on the femoral head, surfaces of the distal tibiae, talus,
and the talar facet on the calcaneus. Left carpals, left acetabulum, and the right semilunar notch
are affected without bilateral expression. Collapse of the calcaneus at the talar facet has led to the
talus tilting anteriorly and inferiorly into a cupped area of the calcaneus. The facet has depressed
86

2.34 mm. These changes are also consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. However, due to the age­
at-death of the individual, the differential diagnosis of osteoarthritis is age-related change. General
stress, such as farming, may be the cause for the Schmorl’s nodes on thoracic vertebrae 8, 9, and
10. Thoracic 8 and 10 have concomitant Schmorl’s nodes with thoracic 9, 8 with only an inferior
node, and 10 with a superior node. The presence of Schmorl’s nodes suggests this individual was
subjected to trauma and/or performed heavy labor at some point during his lifetime. Entheseal
changes of the pectoralis insertion of the humerus could not be observed, limiting occupational
assessments. This individual also has an olecranon spur extending 4.9 mm from the proximal
olecranon. Capasso et al. (1999) term this a woodcutters lesion because these changes have been
seen in individuals with such occupations as woodcutting, quarrying, and blacksmithing. Of
additional interest is the presence of the extension of the femoral head that indicates extensive
squatting or sitting cross-legged (Capasso et al. 1999). This individual, just as Burial 8, may have
suffered from rheumatoid arthritis. Though the changes are not yet severe, the age-at-death is not
outside the onset of the disease that may have occurred later in life. It is possible the woodcutters
lesion and Schmorl’s nodes occurred in early adulthood since progression of this disease leads to
malaise, fatigue, joint pain, and swelling with the pain and stiffness limiting movement
(Schumacher 1988). Thus, the changes in the femoral head indicative of squatting or sitting crosslegged could be associated with the malaise, fatigue, and joint pain. However, this could also be
related to occupational changes or simply a preference in sitting style.

Developmental Defects
Abnormalities developed during fetal growth are known as developmental defects. Typically, these
defects occur during the first eight weeks following conception (Barnes 1994). Genetic and
environmental factors influence the development of skeletal elements. Genetic factors influencing
developmental defects are considered malformations. Deformation alters the normally developing
skeletal element in-utero or postnatally (Barnes 1994). At times, both genetic or environmental
factors can cause the same malformation or deformation. For example, sacral neural arch defects
(spina bifida) can result from genetic predisposition or the lack of folic acid in the mother’s diet,
as opposed to rickets, which is strictly an environmental effect. Developmental defects are useful
for tracking biological affinities and access to certain dietary requirements—vitamin C. The
frequency of the same defects in closely related populations, or as in the case of Campbell’s Bayou
Cemetery, can elucidate possible kinship and residence patterns. Though developmental defects
were absent from the individuals buried at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, poor preservation of the
skeletal elements of fetuses and term infants hindered assessments (Barnes 1994). At Campbell’s
Bayou Cemetery, 20 percent of the graves were of fetuses (6 of 35) and a term infant (1/35). Barnes
(1994) notes that severe developmental defects comprise 20 percent of stillbirths and 20–40 percent
of spontaneous abortions, leaving the potential that some of the fetuses had developmental defects.
A sacral neural arch defect affecting the second sacral segment resulted in a cleft of this segment
in Burial 25 and incomplete development of the third and fourth neural arches. This individual
survived to 25–30 years of age-at-death. Individuals with sacral cleft defects may not have been
aware of their developmental defect since the fibrous and tough tissue would have protected the
cleft (Barnes 1994).

87

Trauma
Very little trauma was found in Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery individuals. Trauma consisted of
healed greenstick fractures and possible sharp force trauma. Sharp force trauma was evident in the
right tibia on the arcuate of the male in Burial 13. The wound was healed, although the hinged
bone was still visible because it did not reset properly and protruded 5.1 mm from the bone. Three
others have fully healed greenstick fractures. Burial 26 had a greenstick fracture of the fourth left
metacarpal, Burial 25 of the distal right ulna, and the distal foot phalange of Burial 8. Trauma to
the neck in Burial 8 resulted in fusion of cervical vertebrae 3 and 4, which is consistent with Porter’s
Neck of Levy (Capasso et al. 1999).

Infection
Evidence of chronic infectious, metabolic, endocrine, and neoplastic disease was lacking at
Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, except in one individual. Though there is no evidence of these
conditions on the bone for the remaining individuals, they may have suffered from one or more
these diseases that did not alter the skeleton either because the individual succumbed to the disease
before it could alter the bone or they succumbed to some other health insult before the disease could
alter the bone. In addition, some of these diseases, such as tuberculosis, only affect the bone in a
small percentage of cases.
Burial 10 has evidence of osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is an infectious disease affecting the
marrow cavity of the bone and often results in pyogentic bacteria entering the bone; the most
common causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus in 90 percent of the cases (Ortner 2003). In
adults, the inflammation of the bone is less extensive and the bone growth associated with the
condition is limited. In Burial 10, the medial line of the right femoral linea aspera has sclerotic and
woven bone with cloaca that drains in a superior direction. The presence of the cloacal opening
indicates the pus from the infection escaped through the skin surface. The individual with this
condition would have become seriously ill, with associated pain, fever, and immobility, and
surviving this condition was uncommon before the advent of antibiotics (Roberts and Manchester
2005).

Evidence of Medical Treatment
Trephination is a surgical procedure for removing a piece of the skull, exposing the dura of the
brain. There are four general methods for removing the piece of skull: scraping, grooving, boring
and cutting, and rectangular intersecting cuts to remove the bone fragment (Gross 1999).
Successful surgeries relied on the surgeon not hitting a major artery and avoiding puncture of the
dura (Roberts and Manchester 2005). Trephination went in and out of vogue during the nineteenth
century. In the early 1800s, trephination moved from the home to hospitals. The increased
mortality by the procedure being performed in hospitals resulted in the procedure becoming an
unfavorable practice. In the late 1800s, the introduction of anesthetics, antisepsis, and prophylaxis
of infection propelled trephination into becoming a modern procedure for head trauma (Gross
1999). In the nineteenth century, trephination was used to treat cases of epilepsy, head trauma, and
mental illness. A female over the age of 60 years-at-death (Burial 7) exhibits pathological changes
consistent with trephination. An opening 60 mm superior to inferior in orientation and 55 mm
anterior–posterior is located on the right parietal and is the only hole present. The bone is fully
88

healed and the spongy bone is no longer visible. The scraping method was probably used since the
wound has beveled edges. Healed bone at the edge of the wound is 1.7 mm thick whereas the
undamaged bone is 6.4 mm thick. The major arteries, such as the middle meningeal, were avoided.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
Historical demographic records can provide an immense amount of information regarding past
health and lifestyles. However, there are deficiencies inherent in the data because mortality
schedules only capture a snapshot of the causes and ages of death every decade and because of the
lack of understanding of the causes of many diseases, not to mention issues surrounding legibility
of the handwriting. Collection of such historic data also left out smaller areas or individuals based
upon the enumerator’s path. Though the cemetery is not a representation of the living population
in Virginia Point since not all who resided at Virginia Point were buried there, it does provide
important information on the lives of the first settlers of the Galveston area and how the relationship
between their physical and cultural environments influenced their overall health.
These comparisons will indicate if the diseases, age, and life stressors correlate with expectations
based on regional data summarized from census mortality schedules and excavated cemeteries.
Mortality schedules are from the Galveston 1850, 1870, and 1880 censuses and provide local
comparisons that would have also included Virginia Point inhabitants, even though there are only
48 people on the 1860 census roll. Comparisons on health, trauma, stature, etc., use comparative
data from excavated cemeteries. The cemeteries chosen for comparison are small family or
community cemeteries in rural areas dating to the late 1800s. An effort was made to include as
many cemeteries from Texas as possible because these individuals likely would have been exposed
to similar stressors because of immigrating to the Texas frontier.
 Sinclair Cemetery 41DT105 (1850–1880): This cemetery is a small, family cemetery in Delta
County, Texas. The residents belonged to a community called Granny’s Neck that was 3
miles south of Cooper, Texas, the county seat and largest town in the county. The burial
population consists of white farmers (Winchell et al. 1995). Number of burials: 16.
 Tucker Cemetery (1880–1942): Located near 41DT105, this cemetery is a small family
cemetery. It is northeast of 41DT105 in Delta County, Texas (Winchell et al. 1995). Number
of burials: 16.
 Reynolds Cemetery (1832-1900): This is a small, rural cemetery in Kanawha County, West
Virginia. The interments were of the founding Reynolds family and potentially other locals
interred after the Reynolds family moved from the location (Bybee 2002). Number of burials:
31.
 Morgan Chapel (1891–1937): These graves are from a historic cemetery in Bastrop County,
Texas (Taylor et al. 1986). Number of burials: 21.
 Brunson-Sisson Cemetery (1836–1892): This cemetery is a small, rural cemetery of pioneers
and farmers near Joliet, Illinois. The burial population consisted of three related Caucasian
families (Cobb 1999). Number of burials: 20.
 Pioneer Cemetery (1880-1921): These burials represent a small portion of Pioneer Cemetery
in Dallas, Texas. The individuals relocated were Caucasian (Cooper et al. 2000). Number of
burials: 15.
 Texas State Cemetery (1844–1951): A relocation project moved several white Confederate
soldiers due to renovation activities. These burials represent slightly later interments, most in
the early 1900s (Dockall and Baker 1996). Number of burials: 57.
89

 Cross Homestead (1820–1849): This cemetery contains Caucasian tenant farmers in
Springfield, Illinois (Larsen et al. 1995). Number of burials: 29.
 Choke Canyon (1860–1930): Located in southcentral Texas, these data represent the
combining of five small Caucasian cemeteries (Fox 1984). Number of burials: 34.
 Voegtly Cemetery (1833–1861): This cemetery is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the Voegtly
churchyard next to the Voegtly church. The first interments were Swiss-German settlers
(Ubelaker and Jones 2003). Number of burials: 744.
 Ware Cemetery (1858, 1909): This cemetery is in Rusk County, Texas. The cemetery
contained three Caucasian individuals: two adult males and one infant (Norment et al. 2014).
Number of burials: 3.
 Roberts Cemetery (1895–1930): This cemetery is in Troy, Texas, and only a few individuals
in the right-of-way for the highway were moved. These burials are slightly later interments
(McWilliams et al. 2014). Number of burials excavated: 3.

Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics (McDowell et al. 2008).

Stature Estimates
Stature could only be calculated for a few adults in Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery. Those available
can be compared to stature estimates from the comparative cemeteries. Stature estimates in the
reports, however, do not include minimum and maximum scores and investigators must thus rely
upon the average stature listed. This makes it difficult to discern the full range of heights and to
determine if any of the individuals from Campbell’s Bayou fall at the higher or lower end of the
stature scale. In addition, it masks any overlap in stature between males and females as represented
by smaller males and taller females.
Five of the six individuals whose stature could be calculated were male. Height ranges between
168.5 cm to 178.0 cm (5' 6" to 5' 10": Table 3). Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery male stature was
similar to comparative cemeteries whose averages fell between 173.3 cm and 177 cm. Though
many of these cemeteries are small, with five or fewer males for comparison, the Texas State
Cemetery average based on 47 individuals was also similar at 174.7 cm. Mr. Ware, from the Ware
Cemetery in East Texas, exemplifies the hidden stature variance as his height estimate was168.1
cm (5' 6") (Table 4). Stature could only be estimated for one female from Campbell’s Bayou
Cemetery; Burial 10 estimated at 153.1 cm (5' 0"). Though this falls well below the other cemetery
stature estimates for females, this individual’s height may simply represent the lower statures
hidden by the averages since no range was given.
Stature is a good reflection of the health of a population during childhood. Nutritional deprivation,
nutritional quality, and disease burden affect terminal height of an individual (Larsen 1997).
Genetics do play a role since terminal height is also dependent upon the genetic population under
analysis. Stature of the males at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery do not significantly vary from other
Caucasian cemeteries of a similar time period or Modern U.S. Stature Estimates (see Table 4). The
similar statures indicate the adult individuals at Campbell’s Bayou, were not likely to have
experienced greater nutritional deprivation or disease burdens.

Health

Dental Health
Comparative assessment of dental health reflects differences in health and diet among populations.
Teeth are usually well preserved even if bone is not, thus providing a more robust data set for
comparison of access to dental care, personal hygiene, diet and types of foods eaten, and health.
Comparison with Texas cemeteries used during the same period, the late 1800s, expands knowledge
on the experience of Texas settlers.
Dental hypoplasia, an indicator of childhood stress, is high in most of these cemeteries. However,
the small number of burials in each probably skew the percentage to reflect a greater percent of
individuals affected. Six of the 17 individuals with observable teeth at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery
have at least one dental hypoplasia, a rate of 35.3 percent (Table 5). Only the Texas State Cemetery
and the Brunson-Sisson Cemetery show fewer hypoplasia. Vogetly Cemetery hypoplasias are
reported as percentage of teeth affected, since reporting by person inflates the percentages of teeth

Reported for males only
+ Hypoplasia and caries rates are based on observable teeth with one or more caries/hypoplasia

affected and does not account for dental attrition or edentulous individuals. Of the teeth analyzed
at Vogetly, 18.2 percent have hypoplasia. Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, when comparing number
of teeth affected, exhibits a smaller amount of hypoplasia at 14.2 percent.
Hypoplasia present in individuals who succumbed to a young age-at-death is important in
understanding the intensity of stress episodes of that individual before death at an early age. Bouts
of stress during childhood contribute to weakening the immune system, making the individual more
susceptible to further health insults and an earlier death (Larsen 1997). At Campbell’s Bayou
Cemetery, hypoplasias were only evident in children from ages 3 to 11 years. Data are not available
at many of the cemeteries regarding rates in children. Regular reporting of the number of adults
and subadults with hypoplasia will be useful in determining whether other areas had children with
multiple health insults that may have affected their survival.
Dental caries in these populations indicate a similar diet of sticky carbohydrates consistent with
foods consumed by Texas pioneers. Caries rates for Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery are calculated
on the number of individuals with observable teeth. Of those, 64.3 percent had dental caries, some
having more carious teeth than others (see Table 5). Dental care and fillings are unknown for the
comparative cemeteries; however, the high rates of dental caries suggest dental care was minimal
and dental hygiene was probably poor in all of these areas. The only cemetery with low dental
caries rates was Choke Canyon. Differences in caries rates may be because the dates of the
interments extended until 1930. As time progressed from the late 1880s, diets expanded to include
a greater variety of foods and teeth cleaning methods and dental care improved. Thus, individuals
from Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery had rates consistent with comparable areas of Texas.
Degenerative joint disease (DJD) of the vertebrae and nonvertebral joints was prevalent in most of
the cemeteries. Given the general heavy labor required to thrive on the Texas frontier, high rates
of degenerative joint disease in these sites is not unexpected. Larsen (1997) notes that life for the
pioneers on the frontiers was physically demanding, and Texans, specifically noted, had an elevated
prevalence of osteoarthritis and indicators of physiologic stress. DJD frequency and severity is
also known to increase with the age of an individual. Individuals from Pioneer Cemetery are over
35 years of age. Only one adult is under 30 years at Brunson-Sisson and all individuals from Texas
State Cemetery are over 60 (Tiné 2000). At Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, DJD affects all adults
in at least one joint except one female, Burial 7. Given the trepanation, she was probably frail and
did not participate in heavy labor tasks. The amount of vertebral DJD at Campbell’s Bayou
Cemetery is greater than at many of the other Texas cemeteries and may have to do with differences
in the type of heavy labor performed in various areas, particularly given the reported ages at Texas
State Cemetery (see Table 5). Texas State Cemetery had lower rates of DJD in the vertebrae and
this lower percentage of vertebral DJD may be a result of the interments extending into the 1950s
that may reflect changes in occupation (i.e., less labor-intensive occupations) and may also be
dependent upon the small sample size at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery. Articular DJD at
Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery percentage was high (75 percent). Texas State Cemetery and
Brunson-Sisson cemeteries also had high percentages, 94.6 percent and 90 percent respectively. In
both cemeteries, appendicular DJD was more prevalent than vertebral DJD and Campbell’s Bayou
had similar rates. This suggests that vertebral DJD difference may reflect occupational differences
among the populations. Alternatively, the low percentage of appendicular DJD with high vertebral
DJD at Cross Homestead elucidates the differences in occupation changes associated with tenant
farming and living on a costal environment, several of whom may have been sailors.

Schmorl’s Nodes
Heavy, continuous working and general physical stress results in Schmorl’s nodes. Of the 35
individuals buried at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, only eight were adults (see Table 5). Of these,
37.5 percent (n=3) had Schmorl’s nodes and all were male. These three males were 45–50+ years
in age and would have performed tasks requiring heavy labor. One individual also had woodcutters
lesions, consistent with chopping wood or other activities with similar movements. Roberts
Cemetery and Texas State Cemetery have similar rates of Schmorl’s nodes. Vogetly Cemetery has
very few cases and percentages of vertebral DJD is also minimal at 7.6 percent. Their lower
percentage reflect differences in labor practices and lifestyles and, even though the cemetery dates
A.D. 1833–1861, may reflect lifestyles in Switzerland and Germany since the majority of
individuals in this population were immigrants.

Trauma
Individuals in Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery had very low percentages of trauma compared to other
cemeteries (see Table 5). Trauma at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery includes a broken distal toe,
sharp force trauma to a tibia, fused cervical vertebrae and osteoarthritis from trauma to the neck,
and a healed greenstick fracture of the ulna. Trepanation is not included in the trauma as it was
probably caused by a surgical procedure. Trauma at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery only affects 11.4
percent of the individuals interred in the cemetery. Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery’s rate is extremely
low since the next lowest comparative percentage is 25 percent at Tucker Cemetery and the highest
percentage at 77 percent at Choke Canyon. The low trauma rate may be associated with the high
percentage of juveniles in the interments at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery; which account for 27 or
the 35 individuals. Twenty of those individuals are under 5 years of age.

Demographics
Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery provides an atypical view of a skeletal population in a historic
cemetery. The high percentage of infants and children under age 5 in the populations is rare. In
many demographic analyses, concern is posited regarding the validity of the studies due to the
potential of underrepresentation of infants and small children (Chamberlain 2006; Heilen et al.
2012). Archeological demographic profiles usually have an overabundance of middle-aged
individuals with few infants and older adults. The opposite is present at Campbell’s Bayou
Cemetery.
Among the 35 individuals buried at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery are eight male adults and three
female; three were of indeterminate age (Table 6). Children under 20 years of age-at-death, (n=24)
comprised 69 percent of the burials. One child, age 10–15 years-at-death, was estimated to be a
male. Though individuals under the age of 18 are generally difficult or impossible to sex, this
juvenile had a clearly male development of the greater sciatic notch. The excavation of infant
remains in a historic cemetery is relatively low, and the presence of premature infants is even rarer.
The majority of children at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery are under 5 years of age (n=18), with six
premature infants aged 30–40 weeks (see Table 6). No developmental defects of these individuals
were evident, although the poor condition of some of the remains may have precluded observations.
The presence of six burials containing the remains of premature infants provides little-known
information regarding the health insults of women during pregnancy in the late 1800s. Living

conditions of the 1800s correlates with modern developing countries that lack sanitation and
medical care. In these developing countries, infection is one of the most common causes of
stillbirths resulting in approximately 50 percent of their prenatal deaths. Maternal illnesses from
viruses, bacteria, and protozoa such as streptococci, E. coli, and malaria are the culprit of these lateterm miscarriages (Goldenberg et al. 2010). Known causes of modern miscarriage, such as
preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, placental ablation, and congenital malformations, may also
attribute to the preterm burials at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery; however, it is more probable the
majority of these stillbirths were the result of infections and illness in the mothers.
Life during the late 1800s could be harsh for those surviving to term and living into adulthood.
Prior to antibiotics, regular access to clean water, and vaccines, life expectancy was much lower
than today. Exposure to unsanitary environments, nutritional stress, lack of fresh foods/
fruits/vegetables throughout the year, and epidemic diseases are likely the cause for the majority of
the infants’ and children’s deaths, and adults succumbing to infections, epidemics, and accidents,
with a few surviving to an old age of 60+. Summer months were a dangerous period for infants
and young children, even more so than winter, due to diarrheal diseases from poor quality weaning
foods, dilution of weaning foods with contaminated water, drought conditions increasing water
contamination from storage, dehydration, and heat exhaustion. Saunders et al. (1995) report that
bowel trouble was the culprit for more than half of the deaths in 1840 Massachusetts and 39 percent
infant deaths occurred between June and August. Vogetly cemetery also has the same pattern with
13.4 percent of deaths occurring in July and 11.9 percent in August in children up to 5 years of age
(Ubelaker and Jones 2003).

95

Mortality schedules provide specific information regarding types and frequencies of causes of death
for the U.S. census year and the frequencies of age-at-death. Historic population demographic
profiles have a high rate of death at birth declining to the age of 5. Death rates do not peak again
until 20–30 years of age and decline until individuals are up to 90 years of age. Table 7 lists ages­
at-death for Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, Vogetly, site 41DT105, the 1880 Galveston Mortality
Schedule, 1870 Galveston Mortality Schedule, and the 1880 Mortality Schedule for the state of
Texas. Data compiled from the 1880 census for Texas reflect 26.7 percent of the population died
before 1 year of age and 19 percent between the ages of 1 and 5 (Whitley 2014). A marked increase
is present in the 20–30-year age bracket. Though 41DT105 only has individuals in three categories,
two represent the major spikes in deaths. The 1880 and 1870 Galveston mortality schedules have
increased percentages of deaths in the 20–30, 30–40 and 40–50 age brackets. These rates may be
influenced by immigrant populations coming through the Galveston port. In contrast, no
individuals between 30 and 40 years of age were buried at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery.

At Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, two individuals have an age at death between 20 and 30 years of
age, but there are no deaths between 30 and 40 years of age (see Table 7). The spike in age of death
between 20 and 30 years is generally the result of the female deaths associated with childbirth and
responsibilities associated with adulthood. Contrary to typical historic demographic profiles, there
is a peak after the age of 50 in individuals buried at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery. This deviates
from the normal demographic profiles of the late nineteenth century. Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery
rate can be the result of several incidences. One, individuals from the families associated with
Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery may have survived past the trend of being buried in family cemeteries.
The beautification-of-death movement occurring around 1880 marked a trend in burials in
community cemeteries rather than family cemeteries. Second, burials of older individuals after the
beautification-of-death movement in Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery may be a matter of choice,
particularly for older individuals, to be buried in the cemetery where predeceased spouses and
children may have been laid to rest. Third, the high number of infant burials that continued into
the early 1900s may be the result of the choice of burying children at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery.
In the cemetery, there is a concentration of children’s burials located at the entrance of the cemetery.
96

This concentration most likely represents a section of the cemetery set aside for the burials of
infants and children. Adult plots are well spaced plots that do not overlap. At the entrance of the
cemetery, children’s plots are unorganized and some grave shafts almost cut into other burials.
Potential causes of death for individuals buried at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery can be gleaned
from mortality schedules compiled in the 1870s and 1880s. Mortality schedules for the state of
Texas in 1880 and mortality schedules from Galveston County in 1870 and 1880 provide
documentation of the types of diseases and conditions that were most common in the Galveston
area during these census years (Table 8). Most archeological literature states that children under
age 5 died from childhood illnesses such as scarlet fever, weanling diarrhea, measles, mumps, and
rubella. However, a compilation of the 1870 mortality schedule for Galveston County shows that
congestion, inflammation, dysentery, typhoid, pneumonia, convulsions, teething, and tightness are
the most common causes of death. In the 1880 mortality schedule consumption ranks first with
pneumonia, lockjaw (tetanus), heart disease spasms, convulsions, diphtheria, paralysis, croup, and
summer complaints (diarrhea) comprise the top causes of death. Neither of these are completely
congruent with the 1880 U.S. mortality census which list consumption, pneumonia, diphtheria,
heart disease, cholera, stillborn, malaria fever and croup as some of the top causes of death. While
the U.S. mortality census is useful, the 1870 and 1880 mortality schedules for Galveston County
indicates reflects local causes of death. For example, the 1880 Galveston Mortality census indicates
that the two top causes of death in children under the age of five was lockjaw and spasms followed
by convulsions, croup, diphtheria, summer complaints (diarrhea), pneumonia, teething, cholera,
cramps, lack of food, inflammation of the brain, and malformation. In the 1870s census, conditions
consistent with diarrheal diseases is the most common cause of death for the population. For
children under five, teething, convulsions, inflammation, pneumonia and tetanus are the most
frequent causes of death; with tetanus afflicting newborns more than any other age group.

PERSONAL ARTIFACTS
Numerous personal artifacts were found among the individuals buried at Campbell’s Bayou
Cemetery. Burials lacking artifacts were infants or those with no identifiable remains within the
coffin/casket. Those without identifiable remains, however, had coffin/casket sizes consistent with
infants. Among the identified personal artifacts were Prosser buttons, shell buttons, safety pins,
straight pins, bone buttons, and buckles (Table 9).

Buttons were categorized by type, number of holes, and size given in button lines. This analysis
follows the English lines sizing. Both the Sears, Roebuck and Co. and the Montgomery Ward &
Co. 1895 catalog use this scale for selling buttons; a visual copy of the scale is in Montgomery
ward and Co. catalogue number 57 on page 85 so customers could visualize the size of the buttons.
This scale was also chosen because it is the scale most generally used by button collectors.
The method of attachment for buttons includes sew-through buttons, shank buttons of a variety of
types, wedge shank buttons, cross bar, and stud type. Sew-through buttons generally have four or
two holes, although three-way and five-way holes were also available. Shank buttons have a wire
loop on the back of a variety of thicknesses and sizes by which the button was attached. Wedge
shank buttons do not have a metal loop, but instead there is a portion of the button itself that is
raised with a hole through that section of the button as a method for attachment. Cloth-covered
buttons typically have a metal shank base underneath the cloth. Bone, Prosser, and shell buttons
were available most often as sew-through buttons. Metal buttons were typically available as shank
buttons. Rubber buttons and or composite buttons tended to have the wedge shank shape. Crossbar
buttons were constructed of metal.
The Intermountain Antiquities Computer System (IMACS) manual describes button sizes used for
different clothing items typically associated with male attire. Size 18 line buttons are associated
with shirts, 23 lines with trousers, 30 lines with jackets or waistcoats, 27 lines with the pants fly,
and 22 lines with sleeves (IMACS 2014). Sprague (2005) cautions the identification of types of
clothing based on button line size because fashion changes through time. For example, the size of
buttons for shirt closures may be 16 lines in one period but 20 lines in another.

Prosser Buttons
In the Sears, Roebuck and Co. 1898 catalog and in the Montgomery Ward & Co. 1895 catalog,
Prosser buttons are listed as agate buttons or white fancy pearl agate. Plain Prosser buttons, dish
type, are listed as agate buttons and piecrust buttons are listed as white fancy pearl agate buttons
(Montgomery Ward & Co. 1895). Prosser buttons were revolutionary in the manufacturing of
buttons. Until Richard Prosser patented the process in 1840, buttons were handmade. Prosser’s
design patented the first machinery for making porcelain/ceramic buttons. Utilizing his method,
buttons were made by pressing dry porcelain clay into molds to form the shapes, turning them out
of the mold and firing the clay at high temperatures (Sprague 2002). Prosser buttons came in a
variety of styles and patterns, either white or colored.
Prosser buttons from Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery were four-hole or two-hole sew-through buttons
(Figure 15). They were found in various sizes in both the dish type and piecrust styles (see Table
9). One Prosser button with an elevated ring was found with Burial 34, but this style could not be
matched to any sources. All individuals with buttons associated with their burial had at least one
Prosser-type button.
In total, 73 Prosser dish type buttons were encountered in the 35 graves. The sizes range from 10
to 26 lines, with sizes 14 and 16 as the most popular. Piecrust Prosser buttons were larger than the
regular Prosser dish type at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery. Piecrust buttons were only found in 16,
18, and 26 lines. Five of the 10 total piecrust buttons from the cemetery came from Burial 20 and
were size 26.

100

15. Plain and pie-crust Prosser buttons

Shell Buttons
Shell buttons were popular as early as the 1850s. By that time, these handmade shell buttons were
almost as popular as bone or horn buttons. Generally, these early buttons were used for utilitarian
purposes such as underwear or shirts (Rotman et al. 2000). Shell buttons were sold as pearl buttons
in the Montgomery Ward & Co. 1895 catalog and the Sears, Roebuck and Co. 1898 catalog
subsequent to becoming more affordable after Boepple’s 1891 patent for mass production (Owens
and Green 2000). At Freedman’s Cemetery in Dallas, shell buttons were popular during the early
period, 1869 to 1884, and spiked in popularity during the middle period, 1885 to 1899. Shell
buttons were lacking at the Becky Wright, Eddy, Grafton, and Alameda-Stone cemeteries.
At Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, shell buttons were found with Burials 25 and 18 (Figure 16; see
Table 9). Two utilitarian buttons generally found with underwear or shirts were present in Burial
18. Six buttons were found with Burial 25: five size 20 lines and one 16 lines. Size 20 line buttons
were more consistent with a jacket, and size 16 lines with a shirt.

Bone Buttons
Four-hole, sew-through bone buttons were most popular between 1800-1865 (Rivers 1999).
McGowan and Prangnall (2011) date bone buttons to 1833 to the late 1860s and South (1964) to
1837–1865. Bone buttons were also entirely lacking at the Becky Wright, Eddy, and Grafton
cemeteries. Bone buttons were utilitarian and thus found on pants, jackets, and underwear. By at
least the 1890s, bone buttons appear to have been replaced by black horn buttons. This is evidenced
by the lack of bone buttons in the Montgomery Ward & Co. 1895 and Sears, Roebuck and Co. 1898
catalogs.
101

16. Two-hole shell button and a Prosser button

Figure 16. Two-hole shell button and a Prosser button.

Two male individuals at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery were found with bone buttons: Burials 2 and
25 (Figure 17; see Table 9). Each male had five bone buttons sizes 24 and 26 lines. These buttons
do not appear to have been turned on a lathe due to the uneven depression surrounding the
buttonholes. In addition, the button holes are also unevenly spaced, vary in size, and are drilled
from the front and back of the button. The one item that does suggest lathe manufacture is a divot
in the center of the button where a fifth hole would have been located. The presence of bone buttons
suggest these burials date prior to 1870.

“D-hole” Crossbar
Crossbar buttons are an unusual find in the archeological record. These buttons are termed crossbar
or D-hole buttons due to the presence of a crossbar traversing the center of the button creating two
D-shaped holes in the center of the button (Mainfort and Davidson 2006). Mainfort and Davidson
(2006) also note that in 1889 these buttons were termed “japanned suspender buttons” and could
be found in the Marshall Field and Co. catalog. D-hole buttons were first patented in the United
States in 1873, but a British patent existed as early as 1844.
Two crossbar or japanned buttons were found with Burial 14 (Figures 18 and 19; see Table 9). One
of the buttons was corroded and a pattern on the button was not visible. However, the second
button had a diamond pattern. Only a single reference was found for japanned bar or crossbar
buttons. The crossbar button found with Burial 14 at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery matches the
suspender buttons from the Marshall Field and Co. catalog of 1889; this button also has the same
type of japanned bar as that was found in Burial 15 with a tombstone dated 1890 at the Eddy
Cemetery (Mainfort and Davidson 2006).

Metal Buttons
Five metal buttons were found at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery. The majority of these were highly
corroded and neither size nor attachment could be determined. One is a copper fastener, size 24
lines; however, the attachment could not be determined, although it is not a sew-through
attachment. The iron button from Burial 13 could be measured and it is a size 12 line, four-hole
sew-through button.
One snap a fastener was associated with Burial 26, a female (see Table 9). This burial also had
piecrust Prosser buttons and a metal buckle. The use of snaps by males or females varied depending
on the cemetery. At Cedar Grove Cemetery, snap fasteners were most consistently associated with
female burials, but at Alameda-Stone Cemetery, snaps were found more often with males than
females (Goldstein et al. 2012; Rose and Santeford 1985).

Rubber Buttons
A single rubber button was found at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery. This button from Burial 14 was
a wedge shank button with an iron inlay design and was size 22 lines (see Figures 18 and 19; see
Table 9).
Rubber buttons were manufactured after Charles Goodyear obtained a button patent in 1851
(Owens and Green 2000). Between 1850 and 1900, Goodyear’s Novelty Rubber Co. (1855–1870s),
and the India Rubber Company (1880s–1900s) produced rubber buttons (Owens and Green 2000).
This rubber button from Burial 14 did not bear any marks or names to identify the manufacturing
company.

104

Cinch Buckles
Cinch buckles used on vests or pants were found in Burials 5, 19, and 26 (Figure 20; see Table 9).
These two-prong vest or trouser buckles are 1 inch in width. They match trouser and vest buckles
found at the Cedar Grove Cemetery, Eddy, Becky Wright, and Alameda-Stone cemeteries.
Davidson (2006) defines the specific type of cinch buckle as a type to buckle. This buckle was
patented in 1854 and 1855 by Sheldon Heartshorn (Davidson 2006). The cinch buckle at
Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery is too corroded to identify an embossing mark. However, Davidson
(2006) found an exact match in the 1889 Marshall Field and Co. catalogue.

Safety Pins and Straight Pins
Straight pens can commonly be found in graves. These pins are associated with the closure of
either clothing or a shroud in which the body was wrapped before burial. The use of shrouds was
common and was a practice in which the deceased was washed and either tightly or loosely bound
in a sheet or robe (Goldstein et al. 2012).
Safety pins were only found with infants and preterm babies at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery.
Burials 12, 16, and 32 had safety pins (Figures 21 and 22; see Table 9). Two pins had bases that
were difficult to type. Two pins, in Burials 12 and 16, had heads that could be matched to Minerva
safety pins found in the Bloomingdale Bros. (1988) 1886 catalog. The safety pins associated with

Burials 12 and 16 are consistent with the Type 1A safety pin typology designed for Freedman’s
Cemetery. Davidson (2006) notes that Type 1A safety pins were patented by Butler in 1878 and
the first sale occurred in 1879. Neither the 1897 Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalogue nor the 1895
Montgomery Ward & Co. catalogue sold Minerva pins. At the Eddie Cemetery, Burial 14, a
subadult with a potential interment date between 1880 and 1895 also contained a Minerva safety
pin. The consistency with the Eddie Cemetery burial, the patent date in 1878, and the lack of this
type of safety pin in the early 1890s catalog suggest these three individuals from Campbell’s Bayou
Cemetery were interred sometime between 1880 and 1895.
106

Rubber Comb
A hard rubber comb was found with the elderly female in Burial 7 (Figure 23; see Table 9). This
individual exhibited trephination and the comb covered the trephined area of the skull. Hard rubber
combs were not available until after the 1850s. Davidson (2006) notes that in 1866 the New York
company of Weld, Andrews, and Leet offered 10 different varieties of hard rubber combs. The
hard rubber comb found in Burial 7 is considered a back comb. An exact match can be found at
the Eddie Cemetery with Burial Number 17 and can also be found in the Sweester, Pembrook and
Co. 1891 catalog; the item cost $7 per gross. Interestingly, the hard rubber comb buried with
Caroline Eddy at the Eddy Cemetery had the same tine broken as Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery
Burial 7. Caroline Eddie was buried in 1885, suggesting Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery Burial 7
could date at least as early as 1885.

Miscellaneous Item
The “Papa’s Pride” gold nameplate is consistent with a baby pin or cuff pin, but it was affixed to
the outside of the coffin headboard of Burial 11 (Figure 24; see Table 9). Unlike the solid gold
baby pins that are in the 1897 Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalogue No. 114, this pin was gold leaf on
pressed metal.
Ovoid Lead Slug
An ovoid lead slug was found in the skull of the male in Burial 13 (Figure 25). Postmortem damage
to the skull occurred prior to excavation. The head was rotated to the left with the slug placed on
the right parietal. It then fell into the skull cavity during decomposition. The size, shape, and metal
of this slug are consistent with a lead flint clamp for a flintlock gun. Flintlock rifles were used
during the Civil War, but fell out of favor during the mid-1800s.

COFFIN BURIAL CONTAINERS
Coffin Shape
Burial containers at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery came in a variety of shapes and materials (Figure
26). Coffins are some of the earliest forms of burial containers. As opposed to the later rectangular
burial containers known as caskets, coffins are generally six-sided with narrow heads, wide
shoulders, and narrow feet. The second type of coffin shape found at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery
is a tapered box that has a wide head tapering to narrow feet. The third shape is an oval-ended or
elliptical coffin burial container. At Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, the shape was more ovoid than
oval-ended. This may be due to coffin collapse of the side walls that was evident at the cemetery.

26. Coffin/casket shapes at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery

Figure 26. Coffin/casket shapes at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery.

Davidson (2006) discusses cemeteries that contain tapered coffins and in each of these cases, the
dates for the cemeteries extend no later than the mid-1800s. Oval-shaped coffins can be found in
several of the later coffin hardware catalogs, and the oval shape was sketched on the first patents
obtained for rectangular caskets. This patent was issued in 1859.
Burial containers at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery consisted of seven hexagonal, two tapered, 23
rectangular, and two oval.
The shape of the metallic coffin (Burial 22) was hexagonal with double lug, short-bar handles. This
metallic coffin was made of cast iron. It had a viewing window, and the lid was closed with ornate
rivets. The viewing window most closely matches Freedman’s Cemetery window type C.
Unfortunately, the base of this casket from the waist down had been impacted by heavy equipment
109

or other forces that bent the left side of the coffin until it touched the right side. The femora, tibia,
fibula, tarsals, and metatarsals skeletal elements were caught underneath this bent section. This
suggests that damage to the coffin occurred after burial and decomposition took place. The metallic
coffin was found in a large disturbed area suggesting backhoe damage.
Viewing windows were present on four burials (Table 10). All were ovoid in shape and had a wood
cover over the window. Presence of a window was random and did not correlate with age or sex.

Container Construction
Construction materials for coffins at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery include the one metallic coffin.
The rest of the coffins were made of wood. Wood preservation was excellent and the entire coffin
as well as outer boxes or wood arches were complete and intact. Field crew members were able to
remove entire planks while exhuming the remains. Separation of coffin or casket wood from arch
wood was very easy to discern because of the state of preservation.
Macrobotanical samples, which included entire wood planks or large sections of wood planks, were
sent to Leslie L. Bush for analysis. Samples included arch wood, outer box wood, and coffin and
casket wood. Samples from hexagonal coffins, tapered coffins, rectangular caskets, and containers
with the viewing windows were chosen. In addition, samples were chosen from burials that
appeared to represent different time frames in which interment occurred at Campbell’s Bayou
Cemetery. All of the samples were identified as southern yellow pine. Bush states that southern
yellow pine includes the four common species found in East Texas: longleaf pine, shortleaf pine,
loblolly pine, and slash line. Samples were from Burials 3 (casket wood), 10 (casket wood), 11
(coffin wood), 15 (arch and casket wood), 16 (casket wood), 26 (arch and casket wood from the
bottom of the casket), and 27 (casket wood).

Coffin Paint
Red and white painted coffins were found at the Eddy and Wright cemeteries—12 of 16 at Eddy
and 7 of 10 at Wright. The Vogetly cemetery also had a high percentage of painted coffin burials.
Most of the painted burials were typically red and were juvenile interments: 78 percent of the 96
painted coffins. At the Vogetly Cemetery, painted coffins reflect German traditions (Ubelaker and
Jones 2003).
110

Both white and red paint is evident at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery (Table 11; Figure 27). Of the
seven burials with paint, four were red and three were white. Unlike Vogetly, painted coffins did
not correlate with age or sex of the individual. Given the excellent preservation of wood at
Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, it is highly unlikely that the incidences of red paint are related to
poor preservation of white paint. Rather, it may have been a choice to use the inexpensive red
ocher to decorate the coffins.

WOOD ARCH AND NICHES
In many instances, grave shafts are dug as rectangular shafts and the coffin/casket or an individual
wrapped in a burial shroud is placed at the bottom. Variations in grave shaft construction include
the use of outer boxes and vaulting with niches. Outer boxes, the container in which the coffin or
casket was shipped from the manufacturer, served as protective containers into which the coffin or
caskets were lowered. This practice reinforced the coffin/casket, providing protection from the
weight of the grave fill. Preference for outer boxes coincided with mass manufacturing of
burialcontainers. Vaulting was also used as a method for temporarily protecting the coffin/casket
from collapsing due to the heavy fill and prevented slump as the coffin/casket and body decayed.
Vaults were created by excavating the grave shaft to a depth shallower than the intended grave
depth (Figure 28). A niche was dug into the center of the grave shaft that was large enough to
contain the coffin or casket. This niche created a shelf on which unattached planks of wood were
placed perpendicular to the coffin or casket. This type of construction is also termed an arch, coffin
board, or vaulted lid (Bybee 2002; Davidson 2006; Goldstein et al. 2012).

28. Vault burial construction

Figure 28. Vault burial construction.

Vaulting is common in historic cemeteries and was more common in the south (Davidson 2006).
At Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, 15 of the 34 graves, 43 percent, were vaulted. Vaulting had no
correlation with age of the individual, sex of the individual, or coffin styles. Five of the 34 burials
contained outer boxes, and Burials 8 and 16 both had vaults and outer boxes. The presence of a
vault and an outer box in the same grave is unusual.

112

The presence of vaulting suggests the coffins and caskets were manufactured locally. During the
latter half of the nineteenth century, mass production of coffins and caskets resulted in their
shipment from the manufacturer. These coffins and caskets arrived in a crate used for transport.
This crate became the outer box used during burial. One manufacturer’s catalogue, Hamilton,
Lemon, Arnold and Co. 1884, separately sold outer boxes to the public. These outer boxes sold
between $4 and $9 for “Chestnut Outside Boxes.” Caskets and coffins made locally would not
have had a crate available to use during burial if vaulting was chosen.

GRAVE DECORATION
At Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, descendants placed empty alcoholic and ginger beer bottles,
decorative items, figurines, vases, and flowers on the graves. Several graves were outlined with
ginger beer bottles (Figures 29–32).

29. Bottle from surface of cemetery

Figure 29. Bottle from surface of cemetery.

SHELL GRAVE INCLUSIONS
Shell coverings on graves are commonly found in the south. In Texas, shell decoration is present
along the coast, the coastal plain, and southeastern, northern, and northeastern Texas. Shells were
used as grave decorations in numerous cultures and were regularly used in Texas; 48 percent of the
cemeteries in Southeast Texas, 44 percent in the Pineywoods, and 44 percent in the Cross Timbers
in North Texas had shell decorations (Jordan 2004). Anglo-American, Afro-American, Native
American, Mexican, and German cemeteries all have shell decorations on the graves (Jordan 2004).
The shells are typically washed and boiled to create a white shell and placed loosely on top of the
grave or to outline the grave, or set in concrete.

Archeological reports discuss the presence of shells decorating the tops of graves. The Old Bethel
Cemetery in Kentucky has 110 burials decorated with shell (Mabelitini 2007). At Terrell Cemetery
in Kentucky, the grave of Zerelda E. Terrill has mussel shell under the grave marker and in the
burial shaft fill (Favret 2008), and at the Bates Cemetery in Denton County, Texas, a bed of shell
was found between two grave shafts (Tiné 2007).
Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery does have a few mussel shells on the surface decorating graves, but
shell inclusions were also found directly on coffin lids, outer box lids, or wood arches (Table 12;
Figures 33 and 34). Shell was not found throughout the grave shaft, and the presence directly
associated with the lids suggests purposeful inclusion. Archeological literature describing this
specific burial practice could not be located. At Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, shell was found
directly on the lids of 12 graves. Presence of the shell did not correlate with age, sex, or type of
burial container. Shell amounts placed on the lid were either a handful (about 7–10) of large shells
or a concentrated mass of smaller shells.
The significance of mussel shell in graves is not known. Jordan (1982) notes the use of shell on
graves in Africa and Nigeria. Shells are also noted in Greek and Roman monuments and Mexican,
Hispanic, European, and Native American graveyards (Heege 1998).
Shell inclusion in the grave fill at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery is unique. Though the significance
of mussel shell with graves is unknown, shells have religious significance to the Irish. This is
significant because James Campbell emigrated from Ireland and may have brought this tradition
with him.

Shell has been found in more than 30 thirteenth-century graves from Mullingar, County Westmeath,
and at St. Mary’s Cathedral, Tuam, County Galway, in Ireland. Shell was connected with the
apostle James, and typically, when shell is found in a burial, its presence showed that this individual
made a pilgrimage to the apostle’s grave at Santiago de Compostela in northern Spain (RiainRaedel 1998). The pilgrimage to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela was one of the three
most important Christian pilgrimages, any of which could result in a plenary indulgence freeing a
person from the penance due for their sins. The Irish were extensively involved in this pilgrimage.
Shells were sold in the vicinity of the Santiago de Compostela, and pilgrims brought these home as
a memento of their travels.
The presence of shell on the coffin/casket lids may symbolize the pilgrimage to the Cathedral of
Santiago de Compostela that could result in freeing a person from their penance due for sins. Given
they could not take this pilgrimage, these shells may represent the desire to do so. Alternatively,
the shells may represent the prayer to St. James that asks to be victors in the strife of this life and
to deserve receiving the victor’s crown in heaven, thus assisting them in their journey to heaven.
The prayer to St. James is as follows:
O glorious Apostle, St. James, who by reason of thy fervent and generous heart wast chosen by Jesus to
be a witness of His glory on Mount Tabor, and of His agony in Gethsemane; thou, whose very name is
a symbol of warfare and victory: obtain for us strength and consolation in the unending warfare of this
life, that, having constantly and generously followed Jesus, we may be victors in the strife and deserve
to receive the victor’s crown in heaven. Amen [Prayer to St. James the Apostle 2014].

The connection of Irish traditions and the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela is likely related to
the Irish roots of the Campbell family.

POTENTIAL IDENTIFICATION OF KNOWN INDIVIDUALS
Potential identification of individuals reported to be interred in Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery (Table
13) was attempted through use of coffin hardware and personal artifacts to date the graves. In
addition, sex of the individuals, age-at-death, occupational data (various types of labor leave
distinct skeletal muscle attachments), and pathological conditions (known diseases for specific
individuals leave skeletal evidence) provide essential information for estimating individuals
interred. Estimated dates of death for individuals that are thought to be interred relied upon family
recollections, reconstructions from census records, and a genealogical chart of the Campbell family
found on ancestry.com (“CAMPBELL’S BAYOU CEMETERY” 2014). The 1860, 1870, 1880,
and 1900 census records were extensively relied upon to identify the presence of the potential
individuals in the Virginia Point area as well as track individuals to assist in narrowing the date of
death. The 1850 and 1890 census data were not available for Galveston County. Descendant
information provided interment dates for several individuals whereas others were estimated based
on census data that resulted in date ranges for interments, particularly for the Parr children.
Potential date ranges are provided in Table 14 and note the multiple years an individual could have
been interred. It must be noted that the identifications are estimates only, or best fit, and do not
confirm a correlation between an individual and a specific burial.
Correlation between infants and graves proved difficult. Several of the graves in the cemetery
could only be dated as pre-1900. The lack of coffin/casket hardware and/or personal artifacts
precludes information to narrow the interment period. Additionally, ages for the infants provided
by family members and in genealogical reports are not specific enough to narrow the potential
correlations. In many instances, the designation was “infant,” and the “pre-1900” grave date did
not assist in narrowing the time frame for burial. Many of the burials encountered are expected to
correspond to “potential individuals” buried at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery. Only two individuals
are clearly associated with a specific interment. Burial 6 was a concrete crypt with brick
surrounding and covering the lid. Documents state that two of the Parr children died within a few
hours of each other from “quinsy” and were buried together. A brick mason, S King, built a brick
vault for the boys. Though the documents state the boys were 4 and 2 at the time of death,
associating an age with a term passed down such as “little boys” is dependent upon the definition.
“Little boy” could indicate toddlers between 2 and 4, infants, or an infant and toddler. The skeletal
remains from Burial 6 are those of a term infant and a 12–15-month-old child. For eight other
individuals, the preponderance of the evidence suggests that they may be associated with a specific
grave (see Table 13). Grace (Greace) Dick most closely correlates with Burial 17. She is known
to have been the last burial at the cemetery and her age and the date of the burial correlate well.
Mary Parr and Eddie Parr were either buried in Burial 18 or 28. Their reported ages-at-death of 3­
5 years of age fall within the skeletal age range that is difficult to separate into smaller age
categories. Temporal data from the coffin hardware could not be refined to separate the interments
of these two children. Charles Munson is the most likely candidate to have been interred in Burial
11. The age-at-death and date of interment are the best suited for this burial.
Phoebe Rutlage likely was interred in Burial 10. Burial 10 is a female who died between 1874 and
1905. Though that is a large block of time, the burial is that of an adult female. Phoebe Rutlage
was approximately 35 when she died in the 1890s. She became ill, and Diana Campbell Parr and
daughter Jennie Parr nursed her until her death. The only significant pathological condition at
Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery was identified in Burial 10. The female from Burial 10 suffered from
osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is a bone infection that results in fever, pain, and immobility,
particularly in the affected limb. Before antibiotics, osteomyelitis was usually fatal.

*Some dates are extrapolated based on census and sibling data.

The ages of Frank and Mary Jane Campbell most closely match Burials 5 and 20, respectively. The
historically documented age for Frank was 13–15 years and 8–9 years for Mary. Though the
assessed skeletal ages were 9–11 for Burial 5 and 7–9 for Burial 20, evaluation of remains for
individuals in Burials 5 and 20 indicates they were both sickly and suffered repeated bouts of
malnutrition and disease. Increased stress and the physical burdens of being sick would cause
underdevelopment of the individual in terms of height and skeletal maturity, and thus this potential
disparity in their documented ages and skeletal assessments may be due to this underdevelopment.
If these are their interments, they indicate Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery was established between
1838 and 1856.

James Campbell closely matches the descriptions of both Burials 1 and 2. Burial 2 probably dates
earlier than Burial 1 based on the presence of bone buttons, the use of which likely correspond to
more closely to the date of Mr. Campbell’s death. No other potential individuals on the list fit the
criteria and dating needed to be associated with James Campbell. Burial 2 also has a button found
at the knees, consistent with wearing short breeches, which was typical dress for a privateer. Mary
Campbell best fits with Burial 7. Burial 7 is a female, age 60+, with an interment date between
1871 and 1905 and correlates better than the other female burials.
Correlation of the remaining individuals reportedly buried in Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery is
significantly less certain. Correlation between infants and graves is exceedingly difficult. Burials
falling under this category include Burials 9, 16, 21, 23, 24, 27, 29, 31, 32, and 34 (see Figure 11).
Similarly, the ages at death for a number of adults and the coffin hardware did not provide sufficient
data to assign the individual to a particular burial. Rather, potential burials with which they could
be associated are presented in Table 13.

SUMMARY
Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery was successfully relocated in advance of remediation of the
Environmental Protection Agency-selected remedy for the Malone Service Company Superfund
Site. Exhumation of the remains was conducted in accordance with the 405th Judicial District order
(Cause No 13CV0762; Appendix A) that Land Navigator be allowed to disinter and relocate to the
perpetual care cemetery operated by FPE any human remains found in or in the vicinity of the
cemetery area. This work was done in accordance with the provision of the Health and Safety
Code, Sections 711.004 and 711.010 (Appendix B). The remains were exhumed in April and May
2014. This process resulted in the recovery of 34 burials which included 35 individuals. No graves
were marked by headstones. Wood preservation was excellent in a majority of the burials, and all
but one burial had at least 80 percent of the wood intact. Bone preservation was poor in grave
shafts that lay directly on the water table, but the wood was better preserved in these graves. The
condition of the remains was often poor; therefore, the identification of pathologic conditions and
aging or sexing the individuals was difficult due to incomplete remains.
By combining the bioarcheological analysis, coffin shape and style, and the mortuary hardware, a
firm date of the cemetery establishment was moved from approximately 1856 to the late 1830s with
the terminal date still at 1904. The first burials in the cemetery were probably Frank and Mary
Campbell, both who would have died after the arrival of the family at Campbell’s Bayou on
Virginia Point. According to family records, it can be extrapolated Mary Jane Campbell was born
in 1835 and died in 1843/1844, and Frank was born in 1836 and died in 1849/1850, both before the
death of their father in 1856. The second individual buried next to James Campbell is a mystery,
and it is unknown if this male was buried before, after, or simultaneously with James.
Descendant identifications of individuals thought to be interred at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery
were relatively reliable. Burials could not be conclusively associated with any individuals
identified by the descendants; however, the combination of bioarcheological analysis, coffin/casket
hardware analysis, census data, and descendant identifications resulted in a list of individuals that
may have been interred in certain graves. The adult individuals identified with some certainty were
James and Mary Campbell and Phoebe Rutlage. Children were difficult to identify, but there is
good potential the graves of Frank Campbell, Mary Jane Campbell, Charles Munson, and Grace
(Greace) Dick were identified. Levi and Joe Parr were conclusively identified as interred in Burial
6, the concrete crypt with brick covering.

TYPOLOGY AND ANALYSIS OF BURIAL CONTAINER
HARDWARE FROM THE CAMPBELL’S BAYOU CEMETERY,
GALVESTON COUNTY, TEXAS
by
Karissa Basse
Department of Anthropology,
University of Texas at Austin

ABSTRACT
In June of 2014, Versar GMI contracted the author to provide analysis of the burial container
hardware recovered from archaeological relocation of 34 historic burials within the Campbell’s
Bayou Cemetery in Galveston County, Texas. The cemetery is believed to have been in use by
the residents of Campbell’s Bayou including its namesake and earliest suggested interment,
Captain James Campbell (d. 1856). The latest interments may have occurred as late as the first
decade of the twentieth century. Excavation efforts recovered an array of mortuary artifacts,
including one metallic casket, eight types of handles, four viewing windows, one caplifter and
caplifter base, one style of coffin screw or coffin tack, at least eight types of thumbscrews, two
types of escutcheons, three types of ornaments, two plaques, at least four types of ornamental
tacks, one set of outer box handles, one style of outer box screws, one type of box corners, at least
three types of internal fasteners and catches, corrugated fasteners, screws, tacks, and mostly cut
nails. Through a descriptive analysis of the observed burial container hardware, these artifacts
suggest that the relocated burials likely mostly date from the 1850s into the 1890s, with one
interment dating as late as 1910.

METHODS
An analytical database was utilized to record the material, class, category, item, and type for each
artifact item or item unit allowing for comparisons between individual burials. The terminology
and semantics utilized in describing the coffin hardware was in part developed by James
Davidson from A Primer of Coffin Hardware (1998). Other terms use the standard vernacular of
historic artifact analysis.
Material type was identified as the basic constituent of the item, such as metal, glass, or
composite, if more than one primary element was observed. Material type was further classified
according to the specific variety utilized. For instance, metals were specified as an iron alloy,
copper alloy, white metal, etc.
The class of the artifact refers to the context in which it was employed. Nails, handles, and such
were classified as coffin hardware. This analysis focuses solely on burial container hardware.
Artifacts were further categorized as to their inferred function within the burial complex. For
example, nails were differentiated from handles as being purely utilitarian in that they were
utilized in the construction of the burial container, while handles were usually both utilitarian in
that they were used to carry the container yet still decorative in that they ornamented the exterior
of the box. Therefore, most handles were considered a functional decorative object.
Handles, nails, and so forth were identified as specific items or item units within a burial. An
exception is illustrated by thumbscrews and escutcheons, which are usually employed together as
a unit. However, thumbscrews can be utilized without the benefit of an escutcheon, therefore,
they are considered as separate item units even when located together within the same burial.
Type refers to the particular attributes of an item or item unit. For instance, nails were typed by
manufacturing technique (e.g. cut or wire), and handles were typed according to attachment style
(e.g. double or single lug).
D-3

Other characteristics were recorded according to the necessities of each item, such as decoration,
color, manufacturer’s mark, etc. Temporal information was also assigned according to stylistic
and utilization trends, patent dates, catalog matches, and so forth when available.
Non-quantifiable artifacts include the remains of wood in coffin or vault construction, paint, and
textiles. These items were recorded as presence or absence, but otherwise excluded from detailed
analysis. Specimens that were identifiable as fragments of a larger item were assigned the
minimum number of items identified within the sample (n). For example, the singular pieces of a
broken copper ornament were counted individually as specimens, and quantified as units as they
were determined to be parts of a larger, distinct item.
In additional to an analytical database, a site specific coffin hardware typology was developed for
decorative hardware and distinctive functional hardware. The numbering system utilized was
maintained across burials and cross-dated with a collection of 96 contemporaneous coffin
hardware, casket, coffin, burial container, undertaker, and funeral supply catalogs and pricelists.

ANALYTICAL RESULTS
A total of 1,404 artifactual specimens were recovered from the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery. Of
these specimens, 735 individual items or item units were identified. Artifactual items that will be
discussed in detail in this report include burial container hardware (n=734) and a metallic casket
(n=1).

BURIAL CONTAINER HARDWARE
Burial container hardware is defined as items, permanently affixed to the coffin or casket, which
are utilized both to construct the burial container as well as the elements used to secure and
decorate it for transportation, viewing, and interment. At the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, coffin
hardware was broadly categorized as functional, functioning decorative, and purely decorative
according to the perceived use within each burial complex. The following is a presentation of the
results of each of these analytical categories.

Functional Hardware (n=590)
Functional hardware recovered from the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery includes items such as
nails, screws, internally imbedded latches, tacks, and unidentified wood fasteners. A total of 590
functional items was identified from 1,229 individual specimens.

Nail (n=503)
Nails provide a broad chronological indicator for historic burials and can be classified into three
general production methods: wrought, cut, and wire. Hand forging was the first production
method for nails and produces a distinct nail shaft, which tapers on all sides. Wrought nails have
been produced for thousands of years, but were succeeded by cut nail production in America
beginning in the 1790s. However, it was not until around 1815 that technological advances
D-4

allowed cut nails to replace wrought nails in the construction industry. The manufacturing
technique for cut nails can be further classified according to the directions from which the flat,
iron sheet-blanks were cut. Cutting from opposite sides of the iron blank has occurred since
about 1810, while cutting from the same side has occurred since about 1830. Although cut nails
are still manufactured today as a specialty item, wire nails began supplanting cut nails in 1885
with the development of Bessemer steel which allowed for a cheaper and more durable wire nail
(Edwards and Wells 1993).
In the urban, coffin industry of Texas it has been suggested that cut nails were still used
sporadically until around 1905 (Davidson 1998:21). At the Freedman’s Cemetery in Dallas,
Texas, wire nails did not replace cut nails in coffin construction until around 1895 or 1900 due in
part to economic necessity (Davidson 1998:158). Furthermore, Nelson states that although wire
nail production had been established on the east coast of America and even earlier in Europe,
wire nails did not come into common usage until the 1890s (1968). Edward and Wells project an
even later date of circa 1900 concerning the predominance of wire nails within an architectural
context in Louisiana. It could be suggested that due to the rural character of the community of
Campbell’s Bayou that the introduction of wire nails may be even later. However, the
community’s proximity to the major shipping port of Galveston may have allowed an earlier
introduction date. Therefore, cut nails of indeterminate sides at the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery
were assigned a summary date of 1815 to circa 1905, and wire nails were assigned a summary
date of 1885 to present.
Nails from the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery were classified according to production method, size,
and treatment. From the 1,123 nail specimens, 503 individual nails were identified according to
the minimum number of heads present. The majority of individual nails recovered were cut
(n=411), possibly cut (n=28), and possibly wire (n=45), while the remaining could not be
identified (n=19). Due to overwhelming poor preservation of the nail shafts, no burials contained
nails of identifiable sides.
The size of the nail was measured for complete specimens only (n=97). The United States penny
size system was utilized wherein penny is abbreviated with a “d” and an increasing number
indicates a longer nail. Penny sizes at the cemetery ranged from 4d (n=2), 5d (n=7), 6d (n=13),
7d (n=34), 9d (n=34), and 16d (n=7).
At the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, treatment of nails consisted of clinching only. Clinching is
identified by the bent shaft of a nail whose angle is usually uniformly identified with other
specimens from the same burial. The bending of the shaft prevents the nail from becoming
dislodged and loosening. Clinching is usually performed on wire nails rather than cut nails,
however, at the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery four cut nails were clinched whereas one
indeterminate shaft nail exhibited evidence of clinching. A total of 13 clinched nail shafts from
fragments of cut nails were also observed.
One other possible nail was observed from Burial 22. The indeterminate shaft measured
approximately six inches in length, which is equivalent to a 60d nail. Additionally, four
specimens of ferrous alloy fragments were identified as possible nail or screw shafts. No
complete specimens were present.

D-5

Screw (n=4)
A total of seven iron screws and screw fragments were recovered from within three burials at the
Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery. Of this number, three are likely associated with other fragmented
hardware elements such as handles, coffin screws, or thumbscrews. The other four items
represent screws with intact heads from within burials (8, 11, 12). The remaining screws were
identified by the presence of a gimlet shaft only. Ten additional ferrous alloy shaft fragments
were observed that could be possible screws; however, preservation was such that a definitive
identification could not be made.

Corrugated Fasteners (n=1)
A single corrugated fastener was observed at the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery (Burial 17).
Corrugated fasteners are thin strips of ferrous metal exhibiting a grooved surface along the lateral
edge, which were driven between two pieces of wood to connect them along a joint. The first
patent for such fasteners was issued in 1884 to an Albert H. Walker of Brooklyn, New York (U.S.
Utility Patent No. 300536). However, it was not until the 1890s that a proliferation of patents
based on improvements in corrugated fasteners and a means of more easily securing the fasteners
occurred (see U.S. Utility Patents 366269, 406545, 419973, 427632, 428701). Recovery of
corrugated fasteners in at least nine other historic cemeteries in Texas, and other states, such as
Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas, and West Virginia, provides a summary date of 1896 until around
1956, for use within burial contexts (Pye 2011:45).

Internally Embedded Latches and Fasteners (n=15)
A total of 17 internally embedded latches and fastener fragments were recovered from five graves
at the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery (Burial 3, 5, 11, 26, 33). A total of 10 specimens consisting
of at least eight Type 1 Internal Fasteners (Freedman’s Type 1 Iron Closures of the looped wire
variety) were identified. Davidson classified this type of fastener at the Freedman’s Cemetery in
Dallas as consisting of an iron screw with a wire looped around the top of the head terminating in
a projecting, pointed tip. This type of specimens consisting of at least eight Type 1 Internal
Fasteners (Freedman’s Type 1 Iron Closures of the looped wire variety) were identified.
Davidson classified this type of fastener at the Freedman’s Cemetery in Dallas as consisting of an
iron screw with a wire looped around the top of the head terminating in a projecting, pointed tip
(Figure D-1). This type of iron closure was hypothesized to secure the internal corners of the
burial container (1998:18). Davidson suggests this type of internally embedded fastener was
utilized in coffin construction after 1890; however, patent information suggests that it may have
been introduced as early as 1881 for general wooden box corner construction (U.S. Utility Patent
237806). At the Adams Cemetery in Robertson County, Texas, Iron Closure Type 1 was also
employed in a single burial dating to 1888 as indicated by an inscribed headstone (Anderson et al
2011: 107). Therefore, a terminus post quem of 1881 is assigned to Freedman’s Type I Iron
Closures for the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery due to their possible availability, although it is
likely that 1888 serves as a more feasible introduction date.

D-7

A second variety of internally embedded latches observed at the cemetery include top fasteners
(n=7) from Burials 5 and 26. Top fasteners are a complex coffin lid closure mechanism involving
corresponding hooks, springs, and adjoining base plates (Figure D-2). Generally speaking a
complete set of top fasteners would include two head body plates to receive two spring-loaded
latches operated by thumb levers, and two foot body plates to receive similarly shaped latches.
As the names imply, the head and foot body plates were mounted along the top of the sideboards
of the casket near the head and foot, respectively.

Figure D-2. Top Fasteners from page 77 of the 1920s-1930s Langenau Manufacturing Company catalog.

The earliest patents located in the U.S. Patent Office for complex latching top fasteners for burial
containers occur in the late 1880s (see U.S. Utility Patents 377325, 383235, and 401663).
Improvements upon these mechanisms were made at least into the 1960s by the Langenau
Manufacturing Company (U.S. Utility Patent 3048435). Therefore a summary date of circa 1890
to circa 1960 is assigned to top fasteners.
Top fasteners recovered at the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery include a round, foot hook with
corresponding square, body plate from Burial 5, and an unidentifiable head spring and body plate
from Burial 26. An additional five more indeterminate type top fasteners and top fastener
fragments were observed from Burial 5.

D-8

Tack (n=45)
At the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, 47 plain, iron alloy tack specimens consisting of 45
complete tacks were recovered from 11 individual burials (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 16, 19, 24 25, 33, 34).
Tacks are not considered highly temporally diagnostic and were, therefore, not assigned a
summary date range; however, they provide excellent indicators as to the presence of a fabric
lining in a burial container. Tacks found in larger quantities from a single grave imply that the
coffin was lined with fabric and the tacks secured its placement (Davidson 1998:20). Relatively
few tacks found in conjunction with ornaments, ornamental tacks or coffin tacks suggest that they
were utilized to secure the ornamentation. At the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, no burials
contained relatively large quantities of tacks. However, the lack of other hardware utilizing tacks
conclusively suggests fabric lining was present in some burials (Burials 1, 6, 24, 33). Five burials
contained tacks which could have been utilized in other hardware or lining (Burial 2, 7, 19, 25,
34). The tacks from a single burial were attributed to other ornamentation and were likely not
lined (Burial 16), while Burial 2 contained few tacks due to the profusion of other decorations, it
is likely this burial container was also lined. Tacks with ornamental heads will be discussed in
the following section.

Outer Box Hardware (n=15)
Outer box hardware is a type of burial container hardware produced with the intention of use on a
secondary box, likely used to protect the coffin or casket proper during shipping. The inclusion
of an outer box within a grave would provide a means of disposal, as well as another protective
layer for the deceased. Outer box hardware observed at the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery includes
box corners (n=4), outer box handles (n=4), and outer box screws (n=7) from seven individual
burials (7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19). Burial 7 included exclusively outer box handles of the single
lug swingbail variety and Burial 10 contained four three-pronged box corners. The remaining
burials contained between one to two outerbox screws consisting of a flat, ferrous alloy ovoid
attached to a gimlet shaft. The presence of an outerbox is likely within Burials 7, 10, 11, 14, 15,
and 17, due to a duplication of other interior hardware, such as handles or thumbscrews.
However, Burial 19 contained only box screws and no corresponding thumbscrews, therefore
either box screws were utilized as a means of burial case closure or another form of closure, such
as nails were utilized on the interior coffin and box screws indeed graced an outer box.

Functioning Decorative Hardware (n=86)
Functioning decorative hardware is considered ornamental but also served a utilitarian purpose.
Such hardware recovered from the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery includes caplifters and caplifter
bases, coffin, thumbscrews and escutcheons, handles, and a metallic casket. A total of 108
specimens consisting of 86 items were identified from 12 individual graves. Functioning
decorative hardware types are discussed further below.

D-9

Caplifter and Caplifter Base (n=2)
A caplifter and associated base are related to the wooden cover placed over a viewing window
(Figure D-3). Cast of white metal in a decorative form, caplifters function as a knob or handle to
remove and replace the viewing window cover. Although caplifters were utilized in conjunction
with viewing windows until the latter fell out of favor in the 1920s, they were more commonly
employed in the 1870s and 1880s (Davidson 2004: 396). A single caplifter and base were
recovered from Burial 3 at the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery consisting of a three-dimensional
daisy with embossed petals. The corresponding base is stylistically matched, depicting a bouquet
of flowers. A summary date of 1880 to 1920 was supplied for the single caplifter due to seven
catalog matches.

Figure D-3. Caplifter from Burial 3.

Thumbscrew and Escutcheon (n=49)
Thumbscrews are a type of decorative coffin lid closure represented at the Campbell’s Bayou
Cemetery. They were both technologically easier to use as a means of lid closure than earlier
coffin screws, and ornamentally more variable. Thumbscrews only required a thumb and
forefinger to secure the lid of a coffin. Available in such motifs as a draped pillar, “At Rest,” a
pulled curtain, or a funerary urn, thumbscrews had a wide variety of stylistic appeals (Figure D4). A total of eight unique styles were identified at the cemetery. Thumbscrews are frequently
used in association with a stylistically matched escutcheon in order to protect the underlying
wood, therefore, a thumbscrew and escutcheon are considered corresponding items when
observed within the same burial complex (Davidson 1999:8). Thumbscrews were first in the
early 1870s as a means of lid closure, which require only manual dexterity as opposed to coffin
screws, which require tools such as a screwdriver (see U.S. Utility Patent 7797). Their design
quickly evolved from three-dimensional urn shapes, to flat-bodied urns, and other highly stylized
funerary motifs and designs (ibid). As thumbscrews replaced coffin screws, they became the
normative form of lid closure until they declined in popularity in the first two decades of the
twentieth century.
Thumbscrews (n=45) and escutcheons (n=4) were recovered from 11 burials at the Campbell’s
Bayou Cemetery (Burials 3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 26). While escutcheons always
occur alongside thumbscrews, thumbscrews were employed exclusively in nine burials. The
disparate quantitative difference in escutcheons may be attributed to relative poor preservation of
sheet copper escutcheons possibly utilized at the cemetery, which may have been recovered in
lower proportions to their white metal counterparts.

D-10

Figure D-4. Thumbscrews from B. 7 (Type 8 – stylized, flat-bodied urn).

In general, thumbscrews and escutcheons were in use as late as the 1920s, and as early as their
introduction in 1874 (Davidson 1998: 26). At the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, five thumbscrew
types were matched to contemporary coffin hardware catalogs, ranging in dates from 1877 to
1905 (Table D-1). However, dated interments from two other Texas cemeteries suggest that
thumbscrews were likely a preferential means of closure after around 1883 (Basse 2013: 44).
Therefore, a summary date range of 1883 to 1905 was assigned to thumbscrews and escutcheons.

Handles (n=42)
Handles were recovered from ten graves at the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery (Burials 3, 7, 8, 10,
11, 14, 15, 17, 22, 24, 26). A single instance of an aesthetically decorative handle will be
discussed in the following section. Historically, handles were usually decoratively cast from
white metal and attached to the coffin or casket via iron screws so that the container could be
carried more readily. Eight styles were observed within the collection. The predominant type
consisted of double lug swingbails (n=28). A single set of four handles from Burial 7 were of the
double lug swingbail variation with tips attached to the bails made to look like a more expensive
short bar style (Handle Type 6). In addition, a single set of diminutive, single lug swingbail
handles were observed within Burial 3 (Figure D-5). Swingbail handles were in use on burial
D-11

containers prior to the nineteenth century, but became gradually less popular with the introduction
of the more complex, bar-type handles in the late 1860s and early 1870s (Table D-2). By around
1890 bar-type handles were more common than bails, and replaced them sometime after 1900
(Davidson 1998: 13).

Burial 22 contained the only occurrence of double lug short bar handles (n=6). This style consists
of an attached arm and tip decorated with a geometric and floral embossed pattern (Figure D-6,
Type 7). Due to their more complex construction, bar handles were more expensive than their
bail counterparts; however, bar handles remain popular into the twenty first century, while
swingbails declined into the first three decades of the twentieth century (Davidson 1998:11).

Figure D-6. Handle Type 7 from Burial 22.

Decorative Hardware (n=57)
Decorative hardware consists of purely ornamental coffin embellishments, which do not serve
any utilitarian purpose within a burial complex. Examples of decorative hardware categorized at
the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery include imitation handles (n=1), ornamental tacks (n=45),
ornaments (n=3), possible ornament or plaque (n=1), plaques (n=3), and viewing windows (n=4).
Each decorative artifact type will be discussed further below.

Handle (n=2)
Two graves at Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery contained handles, which were purely ornamental in
appeal (Handle Type #8 and #9). Burial 24 showed evidence of a single copper alloy ornament
stamped to appear as a diminutive, single lug swingbail handle (Figure D-7). The design motif
includes the text “Our Darling” and a reclining lamb, commonly located with children’s burials.
This design is strikingly similar to that of Burial 3 (cf. Figure D-5). A second imitation handle of
similar design was present in burial 15.

D-13

(Type 8).

Ornamental Tacks (n=45)
Ornamental tacks consist of a small, stamped copper alloy sheeting attached to the coffin with a
ferrous alloy tack. They are purely decorative in manner and designs most commonly consist of
finely embossed diamonds, floral motifs, and starbursts. They differ from other coffin
embellishment, such as ornaments and plaques, in that they are relatively small, without text, and
were usually employed to decorate the edges of the coffin lid and sides in a greater multitude. At
the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, ornamental tacks were not well preserved and severely
degraded. As many as 46 and as few as 45 ornamental tacks were identified from a total of 47
possible fragments within 14 burials (2, 3, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 21, 34). A
minimum number was established from the number of preserved tack centers. Identifiable styles
included two diamonds, one starburst, and one imitation coffin screw design (Figure D-8).
Ornamental tacks were in wide use from circa 1850 to 1910 (Davidson 1998:22) (Table D-3).
Ornaments (n=3)
Ornaments are similar to ornamental tacks in that they are both made from stamped copper
sheeting (or lead-based white metal) and attached to the coffin via iron tacks. Ornaments differ in
that they are relatively large, which generally entails a much more elaborate design. Styles
recovered at the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery were floral, figural, and abstract. Ornaments were
distinguished from plaques by the lack of an epigraph. A total of three ornaments were
identifiable within two graves at the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery (Table D-4), and assigned the
same temporal range as ornamental tacks (Burials 3, 8).

Indistinguishable Ornaments and Plaques (n=1)
An additional copper element could not be positively attributed to an ornamental tack nor plaque
from Burial 14. This burial carried a mixture of ornamental tacks; however the fragment was
considered too large to belong to the latter category, and may represent either an ornament or
plaque.

Plaques (n=3)
Plaques are another form of decoration commonly found in late nineteenth century burials
composed of either stamped copper alloy or cast white metal (Figure D-9). They vary in shape
from rectangular to oval, and usually bear a personalized inscription or a standardized message,
such as “At Rest” or “Mother”. At the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, three plaques were
recovered in rectangular and banner-like motifs, reading the common inscriptions of “Our Babe,”

Figure D-9. Diminutive plaque recovered from Burial 3 (Type 1) reading “Our Babe”.

“Rest in Peace,” and “Our Darling,” respectively (Burials 3, 7, 11). While Plaque Type #1 was
matched to catalogs from the years 1879 to 1893; however, no matches were located for Plaque
Type #2. Plaque Type #3 matched three hardware catalogues from 1885, 1896 and 1900-1930.

Viewing Window (n=4)
A viewing window is a plate of glass placed within the lid of the coffin in order to facilitate
“viewing” of the deceased. Viewing windows could be either static or sliding, and were usually
structurally incorporated into the lid itself. In either case, a wooden cover was likely employed to
shroud the deceased for burial. The cover offered further protection from the elements, as well as
shielding the mourners from the act of covering their loved one with earth. The covers often
exhibit elaborately designed caplifters and caplifter bases to aid in removing and replacing the
viewing window cover. Viewing windows grew in popularity from the 1850s until the early to
mid 1900s when they fell out of favor, which may correspond with attitudes towards displaying
the dead (Bell 1990:58).
A total of four viewing windows were recovered from the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery (Burials
3, 7, 11, 22). The diminutive viewing window from Burial 3 was static or held in one position
rather than sliding or pivoting due to the lack of a small, drilled hole at one end. The glass pane
is roughly rectangular with rounded corners and expands towards one longitudinal end. Burial 7
contained an elongated oval-shaped window, which was likely static due to the possible presence
of white caulking along the eastern edge. Burial 11 also contained an elongated oval-shaped
window with a relatively more dramatic taper towards the head. Burial 22 contained a viewing
window of indeterminate shape; furthermore, both Burial 11 and 22 exhibited no suggestive
evidence of mobility. Bell suggests that the more angular viewing windows may be later;
therefore a summary date range of 1850 to 1920 was supplied (Bell 1990:58).

D-16

Indeterminate Use Hardware (n=3)
Due to poor preservation of some metallic elements at the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery, a total of
three items could not be distinguished as either coffin screws or coffin tacks (Burial 4). Coffin
screws are an early means of lid closure exhibiting a slotted white metal head molded into a dome
often enhanced with finely embossed crosshatched lines. Coffin tacks are similar to coffin
screws, but differ in that they have a tack shaft rather than a threaded, gimlet shaft. Coffin tacks
are made to serve the same decorative appearance of coffin screws, but would have functioned
merely as ornament due to their lack of screw shafts. In this manner, coffin tacks would be
considered purely decorative, and assigned the same popularity date range of coffin screws from
1840 to 1900 (Davidson 1999:7).
The iron shaft of these items had degraded to the point wherein a tack or screw shaft could not be
identified. Coffin screws and coffin tacks presumably would have served differing uses within a
burial complex, and are therefore considered to be of indeterminate function. The same date
ranges apply for these items as the above coffin screws and coffin tacks.

Metallic Casket (n=1)
A single metallic burial container was recovered from the Campbell’s Bayou Cemetery. Burial
22 contained an adult-sized metallic casket composed of cast and rolled iron alloy steel (Figure
D-10). Although casket and coffin have previously been used interchangeably, a coffin generally
refers to a hexagonal box and a casket to a parallel- sided container, or rectangular box. In the
instance of Burial 22, the container was elliptical with a slight tapering towards the feet. The top
and bottom of the container were sealed with flanges running along all sides of the coffin, which
were likely sealed with a composition cement. Additionally, a profusion of white metal
thumbscrews and escutcheons encircled the casket along the flange. The lid of the burial
container was heavily damaged, likely due to compression; however a slight beveling akin to
head and foot panels was still visible. A set of six double lug short bar handles adorned the
exterior (see Figure D-6, Handle Type 7).
Although an exact catalog match could not be located for the metallic burial container, the design
is similar to patented models from the early 1860s, such as the Crane, Breed, and Company style
(Habenstein and Lamers 1955: 271). However, later styles were to become increasingly
rectangular, or casket-shaped; therefore it is likely that this metallic burial container dates as early
as the 1860s, but more likely the 1870s or 1880s (Crow 2004: 123).

TERMINOLOGY LIST

Terminology
Age-at-death: Estimation of the age at which the individual died; reported in weeks, moths, or
years.
Bioarchaeology: Multi-disciplinary research program integrating human osteology with other
data to address a variety of research topics. Such topics include status, health, paleodemography,
daily activities, occupation, and migration.
Biological affinity: Geographic ancestry of an individual as determined by distinct skeletal
characteristics.
Burial: Human remains, with or without a burial container, placed in the ground after death.
Burial position: The manner in which the body was laid in the grave.
Calculus: Tartar or calcified dental plaque that builds-up on teeth
Caries: Tooth decay or cavities
Casket: Typically a four-sided, rectangular burial container.
Coffin: A hexagonal shaped burial container typically widest at the shoulders. The containers
can be six-sided, eight-sided, or four-sided but are all widest at the shoulder. Shapes include
hexagonal, tapered, or anthropoid.
Degenerative joint disease: Most commonly known as osteoarthritis. It is associated with
degradation of the mass and structure of the bone and cartilage tissue due to aging or
biomechanical stress. In osteology or bioarchaeology, the changes observed are typically on
bone.
Dentition: teeth
Demography: Study of human population
Developmental defect: Lack of formation or malformation of a skeletal element during fetal
growth. This generally refers to genetic disruption
Disinterment permit: Permit obtained from the Texas Vital Statistics Office to exhume human
remains.
Entheseal changes:
ligaments.

Changes to the bone caused by muscular activity of the tendons and

Exhume: To remove a human remains, burial container, hardware, and personal items from the
ground.
Hypoplasia: Lines or pits visible in tooth enamel that developed during tooth formation.

I-3

Interment: Burial of an individual with or without a burial container.
Lytic lesion: Destruction of an area of bone caused by a disease process.
Macrobotanical remains: Plant remains that can be see with the naked eye.
Mortality schedule: List of individuals who died during a census year. Data is gathered by a
specified census area, such as Galveston County. The data gathered only applied to those who
died during that census year; for example in the 1860 census only individuals that died in 1860
are included on the mortality schedule.
Mortuary descriptions: List or definition of the elements associated with a burial. Such
descriptions include grave shaft size and shape, coffin/casket size and shape, hardware, and
personal items.
Outer box: The outer box is a box in which the coffin or casket was placed at the time of burial.
The outer box was generally the box was the shipping crate for the coffin or casket.
Paleopathology: The study of diseases, their manifestations on the skeleton, and the prevalence
and distribution among past populations.
Personal items: Items belonging to an interred individual as part of their clothing, hair
decoration, jewelry, shoes, etc.
Sclerotic bone: Pathologic slow-growing, thickening of the bone.
Schmorl’s nodes: Herniation of part of the nucleus pulposis which may cross into the vertebral
body. Lesions are formed on the vertebrae after prolonged mechanical action of the herniated
nodule.
Sex: Determination of the sex of an individual using differing skeletal elements. In children and
juveniles, the skeletal remains are not fully developed resulting in poor estimations or
undifferentiated elements.
Stature: Estimated height of an individual from skeletal elements.
Taphonomy: In a historic cemetery, taphonomy is defined as post-burial conditions affecting
preservation of the human skeletal remains, burial container, hardware and personal items.
Trauma: An injury or wound to the body caused by a outside source.
Trephination: Process of removing a piece of bone from the skull without removing the
underlying brain tissue. Bone is removed through scraping, boring, or cutting.
Vault: Vaults are created by excavating the grave shaft to a depth shallower than the intended
grave depth with a niche dug into the center of the grave shaft that is large enough to contain the
coffin or casket. This niche created a shelf on which unattached planks of wood were placed
perpendicular to the coffin or casket. This type of construction is also termed an arch, coffin
board, or vaulted lid.
I-4

Viewing window: A pane of glass placed in the lid of a coffin or casket through which the body
could be observed.
Wood arch: planks of wood placed over the niche in a vaulted burial. See Vault.
Woven bone: Haphazard organization of collagen fibers. Generally associated with new bone
formation.
