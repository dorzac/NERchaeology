ABSTRACT

An architectural resources survey was conducted at the Los Ebanos Land Port of Entry (LPOE) in
advance of proposed United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) modernization of the
site. The proposed modernization includes constructing a new LPOE facility and acquiring
necessary land parcels at the southwestern terminus of Hidalgo County Road 41. No road
modifications are proposed. The area of potential effects (APE) for the survey is approximately
12 acres, incorporating the existing LPOE land, the proposed acquisition parcels, properties east
of the existing LPOE along County Road 41, and properties at the intersection of County Road 41
and Julio Garcia Avenue.
Within the APE, the reconnaissance survey of architectural resources identified one historic-age
site—the international ferry crossing—and two historic-age buildings (built in 1959 or before)
contributing to the village of Los Ebanos Historic District. In 2008, both the ferry crossing and
the village of Los Ebanos were recommended eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and received concurrence from the Texas State Historic Preservation
Officer (SHPO). There are no historic-age resources on the existing LPOE property. Given the
area’s topography, the extent of the vegetation coverage in the area, the geographical separation
of the LPOE property from the village, and the proposed plan to maintain the maximum
vegetative buffer and keep the tar and chip County Road 41 in situ, it is recommended that the
proposed undertaking would have no adverse effect on the NRHP-eligible resources. Therefore,
it is recommended that the proposed undertaking can proceed without mitigation.

INTRODUCTION

THE PROJECT
CBP has proposed the modernization of land ports of entry along the northern and southern
borders of the United States (U.S.) with funding authorized by the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act). On June 15–16, 2009, Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), conducted an
architectural survey of land associated with the planned construction to modernize the Los
Ebanos LPOE and of a buffer zone of parcels in the immediate vicinity, comprising the APE for
architectural resources.

Land surveyed totaled approximately 12 acres.

This work was

completed under Contract Number HSBP1107D01730 with Parsons (GMI project number
30217.04.01.01). The objective of this architectural survey was to fulfill regulatory requirements
including, but not limited to, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and its
implementing regulations, 36 CFR [Code of Federal Regulations] Part 800.

The proposed modernization of the Los Ebanos LPOE includes construction of a two-story
inspection station, a secondary inspection building, two parking areas, and canopied pedestrian
walkways. The new facilities would be built in the same area as the current station on the south
side of County Road 41, but extend farther to the southeast than the current buildings (Figure 1).

Los Ebanos LPOE is located on County Road 41, immediately southwest of the village of Los
Ebanos in Hidalgo County, Texas. Across the border from Los Ebanos LPOE and 1.5 miles to
the west is Ciudad Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, Tamaulipas, Mexico. Figure 2 shows the location of the

series U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic quadrangle.

DESCRIPTION OF THE APE FOR ARCHITECTURAL RESOURCES
The preliminary APE for architectural resources totaled approximately 90 acres, incorporating the
existing 1.4-acre LPOE property, the proposed 5.6-acre acquisition area, and a buffer zone of
approximately 1,000 feet beyond the estimated new property limit on the U.S. side of the
international boundary. After conducting an initial reconnaissance survey of the area, GMI
personnel suggested a reduced APE for architectural resources that would consist of the existing
LPOE property, the proposed acquisition area, and the immediate vicinity along County Road 41,
totaling approximately 12 acres (Figure 3).

Figure 4 indicates the current layout of the Los Ebanos LPOE site.

The Los Ebanos

Modernization Project does not call for increased traffic through the village of Los Ebanos; nor
does it call for widening existing roads, but rather keeping the present tar and chip road in situ.
Proposed plans include keeping the new facilities on the southeast side of County Road 41, and
extending the site farther to the southeast than is presently occupied by the LPOE (see Figure 1).
Elevations for the proposed new main inspection facility show a two-story building with a
maximum roof height of 31 feet (Figure 5), as compared to the current one-story building, with a
roof height of approximately 12 feet (Figure 6).

Given these parameters, the preliminary APE for architectural resources was refined to reflect
that the topography and tree coverage of the area prevents visual impact of the proposed
improvements on the majority of the village. Thus, the suggested architectural APE includes
properties along an approximately 1,110-foot (330-meter) length of County Road 41 and
properties at the intersection of County Road 41 and Julio Garcia Avenue. GMI personnel
verified this APE as adequate for the Section 106 process and confirmed it with Parsons and CBP
on June 15, 2009.

METHODOLOGY

The scope of work for the Los Ebanos LPOE Modernization Project involved an architectural
resources survey of the existing and proposed property area and parcels along County Road 41
and at the intersection of County Road 41 and Julio Garcia Avenue. Buildings and structures
constructed in 1959 or before were considered historic-age resources for this investigation.

NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES EVALUATION

Criteria for Evaluation of Eligibility
Cultural resources investigations generally are undertaken for the purpose of identifying
resources that are listed in or eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Any cultural resource that is
listed in or eligible for inclusion in the NRHP is known as a “historic property,” and the term
“eligible for inclusion in the NRHP” includes both properties formally determined as such by the
Keeper of the Register and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria (36
CFR Part 800.2). The criteria used to evaluate potential historic properties are codified under the
authority of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, outlined in 36 CFR Part
60.4 and in National Register Bulletin 15, How to Apply the National Register Criteria for
Evaluation (National Park Service [NPS] 1990).

The guidance is restated here to provide

background on how the evaluation process was applied to buildings in the Los Ebanos LPOE
APE for architectural resources.

The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36
CFR Part 60.4, emphasis added; note that the application of Criterion D presupposes that the
information imparted by the resource is significant in history or prehistory].

Criteria for Evaluation of Integrity
Applying any of the NRHP eligibility criteria involves two tests. First, a property must satisfy
one or more of the above criteria, and second, the property must retain sufficient integrity (NPS
1990:44–45). The NPS defines integrity as “the ability of a property to convey its significance.”
According to NRHP criteria, a resource’s integrity is demonstrated through the retention of
“seven aspects or qualities that, in various combinations, define integrity” (NPS 1990:44). These
seven aspects of integrity, as noted in NPS Bulletin 15 (NPS 1990:44–45), are defined as follows:
•

Location is the place where the historic property was constructed or the place where the historic
event occurred.

•

Design is the combination of elements that create the form, plan, space, structure, and style of a
property.

•

Setting is the physical environment of a historic property.

•

Materials are the physical elements that were combined or deposited during a particular period of
time and in a particular pattern or configuration to form a historic property.

•

Workmanship is the physical evidence of the crafts of a particular culture or people during any
given period in history or prehistory.

•

Feeling is a property’s expression of the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular period of time.
Although intangible, feeling is evoked by the presence of physical characteristics that reflect the
historic scene. Feeling is also the cumulative effect of other aspects of integrity—setting, design,
materials, and workmanship—which creates the sense of past time and place.

10

•

Association is the direct link between an important historic event or person and a historic
property.

Although not all seven aspects of integrity must be present for a resource to be eligible for listing
in the NRHP, the resource must retain, overall, the defining features and characteristics that were
present during the property’s period of significance. Properties eligible under Criteria A and B
for their historic association must retain “the essential physical features that made up its character
or appearance during the period of its association with the important event, historical pattern, or
person (s)”; properties eligible under Criterion C for their architectural significance “must retain
most of the physical features that constitute that style or technique”; properties eligible under
Criterion D differ slightly from those under other criteria in that “integrity is based upon the
property’s potential to yield specific data that address important research questions” (NPS
1990:46).

BACKGROUND RESEARCH
Prior to fieldwork, a review of previous surveys was conducted to gain an understanding of the
project area’s background. Between November 2007 and February 2008, a survey that included
the current Los Ebanos APE was performed by engineering-environmental Management, Inc.
(e2M) as part of the required cultural resources investigations associated with the installation of
tactical infrastructure along a 70-mile section of the border between the U.S. and Mexico in Starr,
Hidalgo, and Cameron counties, Texas (Nowick et al. 2008). In the resultant Environmental
Stewardship Plan (U.S. Department of Homeland Security [DHS] 2008), the Los Ebanos ferry
crossing and the village of Los Ebanos were recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP.
These findings were submitted to the THC at its March 17, 2008, meeting, and the SHPO
concurred with the recommendations (Bradford Patterson [THC State Coordinator for Project
Review, Division of Architecture] personal communication 2009).

11

In addition to the aforementioned DHS surveys, a 2008 report prepared by Michael Baker, Jr.,
Inc. (Belfast et al. 2008), for the DHS US-VISIT program investigated cultural resources within
the existing Los Ebanos LPOE boundary, which is approximately 1.42 acres.

The LPOE

inspection station, its associated buildings and structures, and ferry buildings on LPOE land are
all replacements of original facilities and none are historic-age resources (Belfast et al. 2008:188).
A THC subject marker for the ferry crossing is located within the LPOE boundary. Although no
eligibility determination had been made on the ferry crossing at the time the Baker report was
submitted, the SHPO has since concurred with the Los Ebanos Environmental Stewardship Plan
(DHS 2008) that the crossing is eligible, as noted above.

Following the field survey, additional research focusing on resources in the project APE was
conducted at the Margaret H. McAllen Memorial Archives at the Museum of South Texas
History, Edinburg; local history files at the McAllen Public Library; and the Texas/Dallas History
and Archives Division of the Dallas Public Library. Sources included:

• Books and articles relating to the border crossing at Los Ebanos
• Books and articles relating to the development of the village of Los Ebanos
• Books and articles relating to settlement in southern Texas, especially Hidalgo County

FIELD SURVEY
Field investigations included inventory and evaluation of the historic-age resources within the
APE for architectural resources. After an initial visual reconnaissance survey of the proposed
APE for architectural resources, reduced parameters were confirmed with Parsons and CBP. All
buildings and structures within the APE were photographed, as were streetscapes and
representative individual buildings in the village of Los Ebanos, a recommended NRHP-eligible
historic district. Additional field notes regarding design, construction, condition, and alterations
were also taken for each resource. The historic-age resources are discussed in Chapter 4, and
Appendix A provides a viewshed analysis for the resources.

CHAPTER 3
HISTORIC OVERVIEW

THE LOWER RIO GRANDE RIVER VALLEY AND HIDALGO COUNTY
Passage through the Los Ebanos area of the Rio Grande valley dates at least as far back as the
seventeenth century. The Los Ebanos crossing was along the trail to La Sal del Ray, a natural salt
lake located in what is now northern Hidalgo County, Texas. The first recorded crossing at Los
Ebanos dates to the 1740s, when Spanish explorer/colonist José de Escandón led an expedition
through the area. Spanish settlers called the crossing “Las Cuevas Crossing,” referring to the
numerous caves in the area (Solis and Cardenas 2001). Early settlers moved into the Lower Rio
Grande Valley beginning in 1749, typically making their homes south of the Rio Grande. As
more people came to the area, settlers started moving north, across the river. Settlements took
advantage of the Rio Grande as both a water source and a natural line of defense. Land was
offered to settlers at no cost and allocated in porciones, long, narrow land parcels that extended
from the river inland to allow water access to more settlers. Ca. 1815, a mission was established
on the north side of the Rio Grande, San Luisito, which evolved into the present-day city of
Hidalgo (Belfast et al. 2008:186).

Prior to the annexation of Texas into the U.S. in 1945, ranching was the dominant economy in the
area. During the Mexican-American War (1846–1848), transportation, especially by steamboat,
emerged as the dominant industry, catalyzed by Zachary Taylor’s establishment of highways,
military roads, and water routes. After the war , agriculture developed into the major economic
driving force in the Lower Rio Grande valley and the newly formed Hidalgo County, established
in 1852 (Belfast et al. 2008:186).
13

The agriculture boom was bolstered by the establishment of an extensive irrigation system
throughout the area, developed by local landowner John Closner in the last quarter of the
nineteenth century. The railroad came to Hidalgo County in 1904, by way of the St. Louis,
Brownsville & Mexican Railway. The combination of the new rail distribution system and the
extensive irrigation infrastructure solidified and expanded the agrarian economy in Hidalgo
County in the early 1900s. Many new landowners flooded into the area by the 1920s. Through
the Depression Era to the present day, farming dominates the local economy, now using a truckbased delivery system instead of the railroad (Belfast et al. 2008:187).

VILLAGE OF LOS EBANOS, TEXAS
Los Ebanos is located in Hidalgo County, Texas, which was created in 1852 from sections of
Cameron and Starr counties. The ferry crossing and the village of Los Ebanos are part of the
original Porción 40 (Mathews and Mooney 2006:15). Originally established as a mix of farms
and ranches, farming was the predominant economic force by 1930 (Handbook of Texas Online
2008). The county experienced a population boom in the twentieth century, beginning with
approximately 4 people per square mile in 1900, 49 per square mile in 1930, 101 in 1950, 179 in
1980, finally reaching 360 people per square mile in 2000 (U.S. Census Bureau 2008). Los
Ebanos fluctuated between 200 and 825 residents in the same timeframe (Handbook of Texas
Online 2008).

Although settlement in the vicinity of the Los Ebanos crossing was formalized during the
Mexican–American War in 1846–1848, the village in its present form started to take shape in
1904 when the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway reached the neighboring community
of Sam Fordyce and a spur to Los Ebanos was built (Nowick et al. 2008:3-15). For the first three
decades of the twentieth century, Los Ebanos was a center for gravel extraction and brick
production.

Businessmen such as Dr. Alfred J. J. Austin established a number of related

enterprises, helping the community reach what would be the pinnacle of its economic
development. Late nineteenth-century thatched-roof houses were soon replaced by buildings
constructed with local, handmade brick (Cook 1998:60).

Even after the last brickmaking

establishment closed in the mid-1930s, residents continued to make bricks for their own use,
some of which remain evident in the local architecture (Cook 1998:65).
14

After the E. B. Reyna-owned ferry opened in 1950, neighborhood development experienced new
growth. Immigrants primarily from Mexico founded a colonia in Los Ebanos in the 1960s
(Nowick et al. 2008:3-16). As economic factors in Mexico and Central America prompted many
low-income residents of those countries to move to the U.S., both legally and illegally,
settlements called colonias were established along the U.S-Mexico border. In unincorporated
places like Los Ebanos, immigrants lived in unregulated areas with minimal public services, often
with no running water and unpaved streets. In the 1970s, the colonia had an estimated 150
buildings with a population of 825, but by the late 1980s, its population had dwindled to 45. In
2000, population in the village had rebounded to 403 (Handbook of Texas Online 2008).

FERRY CROSSING AT LOS EBANOS
As a Texas Historical Commission (THC) marker indicates, the convenience of crossing the Rio
Grande at Los Ebanos attracted considerable numbers of people and types of activity since the
1700s. The crossing is noted for its proximity to a series of military roads established by future
U.S. president Zachary Taylor in 1846–1849, and its use by Texas Rangers in the 1870s and
smugglers during the Prohibition Era. Prior to the current ferry service, there were also rowboat
and canoe ferry enterprises operating in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Until
the current hand-drawn ferry began operating in 1950, the location for crossing the Rio Grande
was not fixed. Maps of the Los Ebanos area indicate substantial changes in the river’s course
through the years, meaning there is no one specific historic crossing site.

Hidalgo County Commissioner and local landowner E. B. Reyna established the hand-drawn
ferry service at Los Ebanos in 1950. Mr. Reyna’s son, E. B. Reyna, Jr., is the current proprietor.
The service opened on December 22, 1950, and is the only hand-drawn ferry operating on
continental U.S. borders (Nowick et al. 2008:3-26). Los Ebanos became a port of entry in 1950,
when the U.S. and Mexican governments granted E. B. Reyna an official license. The U.S.
inspection facilities are located on land leased from the Reyna family. This land reverts to private
property when the border crossing is closed.

CHAPTER 4
IDENTIFICATION OF HISTORIC PROPERTIES

In total, 19 buildings and structures are located within the Los Ebanos APE for architectural
resources. Three of these resources are of historic age (i.e., built in or prior to 1959) and are
discussed in this investigation. One site was found to be previously recommended and concurred
eligible for listing in the NRHP (Resource 01), and two buildings were found to be contributing
resources to the previously recommended and concurred eligible Los Ebanos Historic District
(Resources 02 and 03) (Figure 7). The 2008 survey performed by e2M recommended the ferry
crossing site and the village of Los Ebanos (as a historic district) eligible for listing in the NRHP
under Criteria A and C. These findings were submitted to the THC at its March 17, 2008,
meeting, and the SHPO concurred with the recommendations.

16

RESOURCE 01: FERRY CROSSING (SITE)
History. E. B. Reyna opened the present ferry operation in 1950, although there has been a
crossing in the vicinity of Los Ebanos since at least 1740. On the site, there is the ferry itself, the
landing, an office/retail building, and a tollbooth.

None of these are original to the 1950

operation.

Physical Description. The original wood ferry was replaced with a steel-hulled boat in 1980,
which has been recently refurbished in its entirety (Figure 8). The original ferry had the capacity
to carry one automobile; the current ferry can carry three. The office/retail building is one room,
one story, flat-roofed, with metal-and-wood framing clad in plywood (Figure 9). The tollbooth is
a one-room metal-and-concrete building set on a concrete slab (Figure 10).

Significance. The area of the present-day ferry crossing has been used for hundreds of years,
with documented crossings dating back to 1740. Associated with Spanish explorers, the trail to
La Sal del Ray, Zachary Taylor’s military highways, Texas Rangers, and Prohibition-era
smuggling, the crossing plays an important role in the history of the Rio Grande valley. The
topographical features of the crossing area are also integral to its history. In the twentieth
century, the technology behind the operation of the ferry itself is an essential component of the
crossing.

National Register Eligibility Recommendations.

This site has been previously

recommended eligible under Criteria A and C and received SHPO concurrence in 2008.

RESOURCE 02: DOMESTIC/SINGLE DWELLING
History. No records were uncovered for the property, but the 1955 Hidalgo County Highway
Map indicates a residential dwelling in its location on the southwestern corner of the intersection
of County Road 41 and Julio Garcia Avenue. Building materials and form support the conclusion
that the house was built prior to 1959, likely ca. 1940. It is one of several buildings on Los
Ebanos Village Lot 103.

Physical Description. The building is a single-story frame house with wood clapboard (north
elevation painted orange, east and south elevations painted white) and a shallow gabled roof with
exposed rafter ends (Figures 11 and 12).

Windows and doors appear to be replacements,

although a number of the wood casings are original.

Significance. As part of the NRHP-eligible village of Los Ebanos Historic District, the dwelling
is an intact example of a housing type prevalent in the area, likely built in the aftermath of the
village’s association with brickmaking.

Integrity. The building retains the majority of its historic integrity, excepting the replacement of
windows and doors throughout the building. Its feeling and association with the mid-century
development of the village is intact.

National Register Eligibility Recommendations. Eligible. The dwelling has been previously
recommended eligible as a contributing resource to the village of Los Ebanos Historic District
under Criteria A and C, which received SHPO concurrence in 2008.

RESOURCE 03: PEÑA GROCERY STORE
History. Built in phases between ca. 1930 and 1960, the former Peña Grocery Store is a mixeduse brick building divided into three sections. At the southeast corner of Raul Villareal Street and
Julio Garcia Avenue, the single-story northern section was the first built, ca. 1930 (Figure 13).
The single-story middle section facing Julio Garcia Avenue was built at the same time as the
southern section, ca. 1945 (Figure 14). Ca. 1960, a second story was added to the southern
section and the gabled entry added on the north elevation (Nowick et al. 2008:3-21). The grocery
store is no longer in operation, and the building is now used as residential throughout.

Physical Description. The brick building is unified by dentil-type brickwork at the cornice line
of the original one-story height. Windows have concrete lintels flush with the wall and basic
concrete sills. Some windows and doors appear to be original construction, as are a number of
casings and muntins.

Significance. As part of the NRHP-eligible village of Los Ebanos Historic District, the resource
is an intact example of a mixed-use brick building built during and just after the closure of local
brickmaking establishments.

Integrity. The building retains the majority of its historic integrity, excepting the replacement of
some windows and doors. Its feeling and association with the brickmaking industry that was
essential to the development of Los Ebanos in the early twentieth century is intact.

National Register Eligibility Recommendations. Eligible. The building has been previously
recommended eligible as a contributing resource to the village of Los Ebanos Historic District
under Criteria A and C, which received SHPO concurrence in 2008.

CHAPTER 5
FINDING OF EFFECT

The APE for architectural resources contained one historic site that was previously determined
eligible for listing in the NRHP and two historic-age buildings that are contributing resources to
the previously determined eligible Los Ebanos Historic District (Table 1). Resource 01 was
previously recommended eligible under Criterion A for its association with the history of the
lower Rio Grande valley and under Criterion C for its hand-drawn ferry technology and landscape
(Nowick et al. 2008:3-31). Resource 02 is a historic-age single-family dwelling recommended
eligible as a contributing resource in the Los Ebanos Historic District, determined eligible under
Criteria A and C for its organic town plan with intact vernacular architecture. Resource 03 is a
historic-age, mixed-use brick building, also a contributing resource in the Los Ebanos Historic
District (Nowick et al. 2008:3-21).

Based on eligibility assessments of the ferry crossing and the village historic district, introduction
of new construction at the LPOE proposed site would have no effect on the properties’ location,
design, materials, workmanship, or association. Of the historic integrity components, only setting
and feeling have the potential to be adversely affected. However, in this case, given the fact that
the current LPOE buildings are not of historic age, replacing them with the proposed new facility
would have no adverse effect on the integrity of the resources. Also, given the extent of the
vegetation coverage in the area and the local topography, the construction of a new, two-story
inspection station would have no adverse effect on the viewshed for the resources (see Appendix
A for viewshed analysis).

In addition, the proposed undertaking would retain maximum

vegetative buffer and keep the tar and chip County Road 41 in place, thus retaining the

25

“rudimentary” nature of the ferry crossing and its approach. Therefore, it is recommended that
the proposed undertaking can proceed without mitigation.

APPENDIX A
VIEWSHED ANALYSIS FOR RESOURCES 01–03

VIEWSHED ANALYSIS
There are three NRHP-eligible resources requiring viewshed analysis of the proposed undertaking
at the Los Ebanos LPOE (Figure A-1). Digital elevation models were created using data from the
2003 National Elevation Dataset provided by the USGS and proposed elevations of the new
facility (maximum roof height, 31 feet).

Field notes from on-site observations during the

reconnaissance survey, photo documentation, and elevation maps were used to assess the impact
of the proposed facilities.

It is important to note that at the time the resources were recommended and concurred eligible for
listing in the NRHP, none of the buildings on the LPOE site were of historic age (the oldest of the
buildings date to ca. 1980). This limits the impact any new construction could have on the
eligible resources. The majority of historical integrity elements—location, design, materials,
workmanship, and association— for the three NRHP-eligible resources would not be affected by
introduction of new construction.

The two components potentially impacted—setting and

feeling—are addressed by this viewshed analysis.

The ferry crossing, Resource 01, is immediately southwest of the LPOE inspection station and
integrally related to its daily operation. Essential to the understanding of the historic importance
of the crossing is its fluid nature. The channel of the Rio Grande is in constant flux and has
changed significantly through the years, thus pinpointing a location as the historic crossing is not
possible. Despite this, it is necessary to determine whether modification of the LPOE site has the
potential to adversely affect the NRHP-eligible ferry crossing’s viewshed.

The topography of the area limits visual impact on the ferry crossing, Resource 01, as seen in
Figure A-2. There is a steep slope between the ferry crossing and the LPOE site, affecting the
view from and towards the ferry on the U.S. side of the border. As indicated on Figure A-2, the
proposed two-story structure, at a maximum roof height of 31 feet, would not displace any of the
ferry crossing’s viewshed. In addition, plans call for maintaining a maximum vegetative buffer
between the LPOE inspection station and the ferry crossing, which will further limit potential
visual impact.

A-2

Plans for the new LPOE site also call for leaving the present tar and chip road in situ, allowing
the approach to the ferry (County Road 41) to maintain its “rudimentary” nature. Since the
majority of the proposed undertaking affects non-historic-age buildings and structures on the
LPOE site, and the vegetative buffer and tar and chip road will both be retained in order to
minimize effects to setting and feeling, the undertaking as proposed would not diminish the
overall integrity of the ferry crossing.

Although no map confirming the boundaries of the eligible Los Ebanos Historic District has been
generated to date, the district is presumed to include the village of Los Ebanos in its entirety for
this investigation. The district’s contributing elements are concentrated in the center of town,
north and east of the Los Ebanos LPOE, but two resources are in the immediate vicinity of the
LPOE, near the intersection of County Road 41 and Julio Garcia Avenue. Resource 02, at the
southwest corner of the intersection, is approximately 600 feet (185 meters) from the current
LPOE inspection station. Resource 03, north of the intersection on the east side of Julio Garcia
Avenue, is approximately 760 feet (230 meters) from the station.

The viewshed for these

resources is indicated in Figures A-3 and A-4. Construction of a 31-foot building would affect
the viewshed of Resource 02 minimally, as indicated. Viewshed for Resource 03 would not be
displaced. Although vegetation is not included in the USGS National Elevation Dataset, field
survey and photography confirms that viewshed east of the Los Ebanos LPOE is significantly
limited due to dense vegetation screening the area (see Figure A-1).

Both resources are

surrounded by trees, with additional trees spanning the distance between the resources and the
LPOE property (Figures A-5 and A-6). In the winter, when coverage may be more sparse, the
new LPOE inspection station would likely have a more visible impact on the resources.
However, visibility of the structure alone does not merit an adverse effect. The proposed facility
would not introduce an imposing or uncharacteristic feature into the viewshed. Therefore, the
undertaking as proposed would not diminish the overall integrity of the historic district.
