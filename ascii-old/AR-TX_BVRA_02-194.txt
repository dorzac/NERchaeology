ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey for Suemaur Exploration & Production, LLC’s
Pieces of Eight Prospect was conducted on February 26, 2008 by BVRA in the
McFaddin Wildlife Refuge located approximately 15 miles south-southwest of
Winnie, Texas in Chambers, Galveston, and Jefferson counties with negative
results. The current study examined two areas that are separated by 7290 feet
along State Highway 87, an area that was surveyed by previous archaeologists
with negative results. Area 1 is the proposed boarded road that leads from State
Highway 87 to the proposed drill site, and Area 2 is approximately 2160 feet of
proposed pipeline to be installed in a cross-country setting away from existing
roads, the site of a proposed tank battery, and 5580 feet of proposed pipeline
along an existing oilfield road and near a small, unnamed stream. Virtually all of
the project area is in a low-lying marshy setting that is an unlikely setting for a
prehistoric site. No high ground suitable for shovel testing was observed,
although three tests were excavated in the marsh. Portions of the project area
were found to be disturbed through road construction and earlier oil and gas
activities. No artifacts were observed or collected. The portion of the project
area investigated consists of 5.88 acres including the pipeline route.
Site 41GV7 is plotted as being very close to the proposed route of the
pipeline that parallels Northeast Oilfield Road. It was discovered that this site (if
plotted correctly on the maps at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory)
has been completely destroyed during the construction of a tank battery. Site
41JF50 (McFaddin Beach) is located offshore south of State Highway 87. Since
portions of this area have been examined by previous archaeologists with
negative results, it was not included in this study. It is recommended that
construction be allowed to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
Suemaur Exploration & Production, LLC of Corpus Christi, Texas plans to
conduct drilling and production activities in order to develop oil and gas reserves
underlying private property in a marshy area located partially within the McFaddin
Wildlife Refuge in Chambers, Galveston, and Jefferson counties, Texas (see
Figure 1). This area is known as the Pieces of Eight Prospect, and it includes the
construction of a drill site, tank battery, turnout, and approximately 12,870 feet of
pipeline. Two pipelines will be installed in the same trench that will be three feet
deep and four feet wide. They will transport liquid and gas from the drill site to
the proposed tank battery and to a final connection with an existing pump station
on private property just outside the boundaries of the McFaddin Wildlife Refuge.
Suemaur will use the existing Northeast Oilfield Road (Figure 2) for its vehicles
and heavy equipment from the existing pump station at the northwest portion of
the project area to the proposed tank battery where a boarded road will be
constructed for a 2160-foot segment that will traverse cross-country to its
intersection with State Highway 87. The existing oilfield road consists of dirt and
rock. This road will be upgraded to accommodate the heavy equipment needed
for this project. The upgrades will consist of replacing broken culverts with those
capable of sustaining the weight of heavy equipment, and the road will be
widened to its original width where it has eroded away. It will also be augmented
with four inches of aggregate from the existing grade. A segment of this road
(5580 feet) parallels a small, unnamed stream that flows in a north-south
direction on the west side of the road. At the point where the cross-country
boarded road will begin, a tank battery will be constructed. This facility will be
150 feet x 300 feet and occupy a footprint of 1.03 acres. This area is in
Galveston County. In order to access the proposed drill site, a boarded road will
be constructed parallel to old State Highway 87 and 40 feet to the north of this
road and continue through Chambers County until it turns to the north in
Jefferson County where it will terminate at a drill site in a marshy area. Adequate
culverts will be installed at various locations along the boarded road to allow for
water movement. Once the drill site is determined to be successful, the boarded
road will be permatized with gravel and rock. During drilling operations, the well
pad will be boarded and occupy an area approximately 400 feet x 400 feet (3.67
acres). For containment, Suemaur will use a five-foot high berm around the drill
site. Once the drill site is determined to be successful, the boarded road will be
permatized with gravel and rock. The permanent pad may be raised as much as
three feet to four feet from the ground surface or level with the levee road. The
project area is depicted on two 7.5’ USGS topographic quadrangles. They are
High Island (2994-422) and Mud Lake (2994-421) (Figure 3).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following information is taken from the soil survey for Galveston
County (Crenwelge et al. 1988:1) and Chambers County (Crout 1976). No soil
survey for Jefferson County was available. The project area is located in the
southeast part of Texas along the Gulf of Mexico and has a land surface that is
characterized as broad and nearly level with elevations ranging from sea level to
about 45 feet. The modern climate of the three counties consists of hot and
humid summers and mild winters. In winter, the average temperature is 47
degrees Fahrenheit, and the average daily temperature is 33 degrees. In
summer, the average temperature is 83 degrees, and the average daily
temperature is 87 degrees. Total annual precipitation is 39.73 inches. Of this
amount, 23 inches (60%) usually falls in April through September. The soils in
the project area (inland from the beach) are defined by Crenwelge et al.
(1988:General Soil Map) as deep saline soils of the marshland. These soils are
very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that are clayey or loamy
throughout. In Chambers County, the soils are defined by Crout (1976:General
Soil Map) as acid and alkaline sandy and loamy soils in the western end of the
county (including the beach) and alkaline and saline clayey and loamy soils.
Much of the eastern end of Chambers County consists of soils belonging to the
Harris series, more specifically Harris Clay (Ha) as defined by Crout (1976:12).
Ha soils are wet, saline clayey soils that are nearly level or depressional. These
soils formed in saline, clayey, sediments under water-loving and salt tolerant
grasses and sedges. They are at elevations ranging from sea level to four feet
above sea level. They are saturated for periods of four to eight months and are
never below field capacity. Harris soils are poorly drained and consist of clay
that extends to a depth of 60 inches. A permanent water table fluctuates
between the surface and a depth of about 50 inches. Permeability is very slow,
available water capacity is low or moderate, depending on salinity, and runoff
and internal drainage are very slow. Figure 4 depicts the marshy area looking
south from the cross-country segment towards the beach.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The areas most likely to contain significant prehistoric sites are the
shorelines along the mainland and the inland bays where and streams where
Indians gathered to consume Rangia cuneata, oysters, and brackish water
clams. As they discarded the used shells, large middens accumulated. This was
a seasonal practice, and they camped on the shell heaps until they moved to
other areas. Evidence for campsites consists of pottery, animal bone, flakes and
flint tools such as arrow points. Shell middens have been recorded along the
coast and in inland settings, and these sites are a common occurrence in the
area. Since the prehistoric Indians probably traversed the entire area within the
project area, any elevated landform above water is likely to contain evidence of
their presence. A recent survey by archaeologists from Prewitt and Associates
(Gadus and Moss 2001), for example, documented shell middens along the Gulf
Intracoastal Waterway from High Island to the Brazos River Diversion Channel in
Brazoria, Chambers, and Galveston counties. The potential for offshore sites
has to be viewed as high based on the presence of the McFaddin Beach site
(41JF50) in adjacent Jefferson County.
Historic accounts of Indian activity in the area suggest that the area was
intensively utilized during different seasons of the year. Explorers such as
Cabeza de Vaca observed the local Indians moving about the area where they
subsisted on various foods and animals that were available at that time. He
noted that in the winter they inhabited an island (possibly Galveston Island)
where they ate roots and fish and slept on mats on shells with a few skins for
cover. In the spring they returned to the mainland or seashore where they
collected berries and oysters. In the summer they moved back to the island
where they ate wild potatoes along with a few buffalo and deer (Gilmore 1974:
Table 1.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A check of the site records by Jean Hughes, Assistant Curator of Records
at TARL in Austin, Texas, revealed no previous investigations by professional
archaeologists had been conducted in the current project area. Numerous
studies have, however, been conducted in the county. The earliest account of
archaeological remains on Galveston Island were noted by Simmons (1908) who
reported human remains in a letter from James Douglas in the Bulletin of the
American Geographical Society. In 1957, T. N. Campbell (1957) reported on the
Caplen site (41GV1). His work represents the first professional study of a site in
Galveston County. In the 1960s, studies were conducted at the Jamaica Beach
site (41GV5) on Galveston Island (Aten 1965) where burials believed to
represent the Karankawa were found. The first large scale study in the county
centered on the Clear Creek Flood Control Project in Galveston and Harris
counties and included survey (McGuff and Cox 1973; Mercado-Allinger et al.
1984; Howard et al. 1992) and testing (Fields and Jackson 1984; Bailey et al.
1987; Howard and Freeman 1990; Howard et al. 1991; Hines 1992).
A major study in the area was conducted by Robert A. Ricklis (1994) that
resulted in the recording of a prehistoric cemetery and campsite known as the
Mitchell Ridge site (41GV66). Two separate areas yielding refuse from domestic
use and a prehistoric cemetery were examined. In all, four small aboriginal
cemeteries were investigated dating to the Late Prehistoric, Proto-historic, and
Early Historic periods. Of special interest is the apparent mixing of European
and Native Americans in the cemeteries. According to radiocarbon dates on
hearth features and burials, "occupation was scant prior to A.D. 700-800, after
which time it apparently intensified, to continue into the Early Historic Period"
(Ricklis 1994:iii).
A check of the Archeological Sites Atlas revealed that the pipeline will
pass to the north of the McFaddin Beach site (41JF50). In 1982, the Texas
Highway Department (now Texas Department of Transportation [TxDOT])
conducted a survey along State Highway 87, and no sites were recorded. This
report was not found at TARL or TxDOT. This is the only survey affecting the
current project area that is depicted on the Archeological Sites Atlas. Coastal
Environments, Inc. (Pearson et al. 1982) and New World Research (Shelley
1981) conducted work in the inland area of 41JF50 (as shown on the topographic
map at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory [TARL]) in 1983, but they
found no evidence of this site in any of their backhoe trenches or on the surface.
This effort adds support to the belief that the site is located on a terrace in the
Gulf of Mexico. In addition to the detailed monograph by Ricklis (1994), the
interested reader is referred to two major works that discuss in detail the
archaeology of Southeast Texas. These are Indians of the Upper Texas Coast
by Lawrence E. Aten (1983) and The Archeology and Bioarcheology of the Gulf
Plain (Story et al. 1990).

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the Principal Investigator discussed the project
with the lead reviewer for this project, William A. Martin, Staff Archaeologist of
the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division. At this meeting, it was
decided that the survey would be limited to the drill site and the area adjacent to
the existing access road, the cross country segment from State Highway 87 to
Northeast Oilfield Road, the proposed tank battery, and the proposed route of the
pipeline from the tank battery to that point where the small, unnamed stream
crosses the road. It was also decided that an attempt would be made to identify
the location of previously recorded site 41GV7. Next, relevant reports involving
previous archaeological research in the area and elsewhere in the county were
reviewed in order to become familiar with the kinds of sites known to occur in the
area. Phil Bishop and Ally Freer walked over as much of the project as possible
given the wet conditions of the marshy setting. The footprints of the drill site,
tank battery, and cross-country segment were not flagged. Therefore, the field
survey crew located the corners of these areas using a Trimble Geo-Explorer
GPS unit with sub-meter accuracy. Because of the wet conditions and lack of
high ground, only three shovel tests were excavated. These tests were dug on
both sides of the oilfield road near the stream north of 41GV7 and were
terminated at 60 cm when it became obvious that there was no possibility of
buried cultural materials. The survey crew searched for evidence of 41GV7, but
the area had been totally disturbed through new and old oilfield construction
(Figure 5). The field survey crew also looked for the presence of historic sites
that might be visible in the form of features. The project was documented through
field notes and digital photographs.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
A review of site records at the Texas Archeological Laboratory in Austin,
Texas revealed two previously recorded sites in or near the project area. Site
41GV7 is described on a brief site form as a prehistoric camp on a bluff where
arrow points and pottery were found by Gus E. Arnold. Although the date of
Arnold’s visit is not stated on the form, he was most active during the 1930s
when he worked for The University of Texas at Austin. The form also states that
this site was probably destroyed through a tank battery, but it is not known if this
comment was added to the form at a later date. An abandoned tank battery was
found in the general area where the site is believed to be; therefore, it appears
that (if the location as plotted on the TARL maps is correct) this site has been
destroyed. Site 41JF50 is known for the presence of Paleoindian projectile
points found on the beach. It is the opinion of most archaeologists that the actual
site is on a submerged terrace offshore. New World Research (Shelley 1981)
and Coastal Environments, Inc. (Pearson et al. 1982) conducted investigations in
the inland area of the site boundaries as depicted on TARL maps and found no
evidence of this site. No evidence of a prehistoric site was encountered in the
project area, and it was concluded that the area is too marshy and, therefore, not
a suitable location for a prehistoric site even though prehistoric groups probably
traversed the area in their quest for food. The only evidence of historic utilization
of the project area observed was an existing levee road and modern oilfield
equipment and roads. The age of this levee is not known, but it will not be
adversely affected as it will be boarded to protect it from heavy equipment.
Figure 5 illustrates this levee road with standing water in a borrow ditch on the
west side where the pipeline will be placed. A borrow ditch was also present on
the east side of the levee road. This study was performed according to the
minimum survey standards as outlined by the Texas Historical Commission,
Archeology Division.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found in the project area. Therefore, it is
recommended that Suemaur Exploration & Production, LLC. be allowed to
proceed with construction as planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site
be found during construction, all work in the area of the find must cease until the
situation can be evaluated by the Texas Historical Commission and the United
States Army Corps of Engineers. In the event that additional areas are added to
the project area, the Texas Historical Commission must be notified as additional
survey(s) by a professional archaeologist may be necessary.
