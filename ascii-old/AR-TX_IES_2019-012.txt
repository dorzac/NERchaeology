ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a
cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES)
for the DFW 121 Mustang Business Park project located within the Dallas Fort Worth
International Airport (DFW) property in Tarrant County, Texas. The proposed project
pertains to the development of approximately 244 acres and is located along Mustang
Drive, west of State Highway (SH) 114 and SH 121. Approval from the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) will be required to modify the Airport Layout Plan (ALP) to
reflect the permanent alterations on the DFW property. Since the ALP is considered a
federal action, the project will require compliance with the National Environmental
Policy Act and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Additionally, as
the DFW is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the project will be subjected to
the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources that could
be adversely affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for
their potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) and eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources inventory survey was conducted on 09, 10, and 14 January 2019.
All work conformed to 13 Texas Administrative Code 26, which outlines the regulations
for implementing the ACT, and was conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 8681.
During the survey, one newly recorded historic-age archeological site (41TR316) was
documented within the APE. Based on the lack of association with historically important
individuals or events, absence of significant architectural features, the degree of prior
disturbance, and lack of contextual integrity, site 41TR316 is recommended as not
eligible for listing in the NRHP or designation as a SAL.
No artifacts were collected during this survey. All records will be permanently curated at
the Center for Archeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio. No
additional cultural resources evaluation or mitigation is recommended. However, if any
cultural resources other than those discussed in this report are encountered during
construction, the operators should stop construction activities in the vicinity of the
inadvertent discovery, and immediately contact the project cultural resources
representative to initiate coordination with the Texas Historical Commission prior to
resuming construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Integrated Environmental
Solutions, LLC (IES), under subcontract to the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). A
description of the proposed project area or Area of Potential Effects (APE), environmental and historical
contexts, field and analytical methods, results of the investigations, and recommendations regarding the
identified cultural resources are provided in this document. Prepared in accordance with the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002) guidelines, this report satisfies the requirements of Section 106 of
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) for the proposed
project.

1.1 Introduction
As the project cultural resources consultant for the DFW, IES performed an intensive cultural resources
survey for the 121 Mustang Business Park Project. The proposed project pertains to the development of
multiple tracts of land within the DFW property in Tarrant County, Texas (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).
Approval will be required from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to modify the Airport Layout
Plan (ALP) that will reflect the permanent alterations to the DFW property. Since this is considered a
federal action, the project will consequently require compliance with the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) and Section 106 of the NHPA. In addition, as the DFW is a political subdivision of the State
of Texas, the project will be subjected to the provisions of the ACT.
This report documents the cultural resources survey conducted in support of the proposed project. The
purpose of these investigations was to conduct an inventory of cultural resources (as defined by Code of
Federal Regulations, Title 36, Section 800.4 [36 CFR 800.4]) present within the proposed project area and
to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the NHPA of 1966, as amended, or for designation
as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) under the ACT (Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter
191 [9 TNRC 191]) and associated state regulations (Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Chapter 26 [13
TAC 26]). All investigations were conducted in accordance with 36 CFR 60.4 and 13 TAC 26, which
outline the regulations for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT, respectively. This
survey was conducted under Antiquities Permit No. 8681.

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
Direct APE
The direct APE for the project encompasses approximately 244 acres (ac) located along Mustang Drive,
west of State Highway (SH) 114 and SH 121 (see Figure 1.1). Although exact project designs for the
APE were not available at the time of this study, preliminary plans call for the construction of an
industrial and mixed-use commercial building development. Ground disturbances associated with this
development will include tree removal, general land clearing, grading, erosion control, building
construction, and utility and transportation development. While subsurface impacts will occur as a result
of these activities, the depth of the impacts are unknown at this time. However, field investigations will
assess to the depth of soils capable of containing archeological deposits.

Indirect APE
As the project will require approval from the FAA, an assessment of indirect effects is required to comply
with the NHPA. The sole potential indirect effect of the undertaking is related to visual effects associated
with the construction of multiple multi-story buildings and structures on historic-age (i.e., 50 years old or
greater) architectural resources. To account for potential visual impacts associated with these aboveground project elements, a 300-foot (ft) indirect APE was considered surrounding the direct APE.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
Climate
Tarrant County is located in the north central portion of the State of Texas. This region has a humid
subtropical climate and an average annual precipitation ranging from approximately 35 to 40 inches (in;
89 to 102 centimeters [cm]). About half of the precipitation usually falls as rain between April and May,
with July and August being the two driest months of the year. The subtropical region tends to have a
relatively mild year-round temperature with the occasional exceedingly hot and cold snaps (Estaville and
Earl 2008).
Topographic Setting
Overall, the majority of the DFW is located within a gently rolling upland setting that is irregularly
dissected by the headwaters of unnamed tributaries of surrounding streams. The transition of the gently
sloping upland ridges to the low-lying Big Bear Creek valley floor correlates to a transition from the more
stable, clay-rich Blackland Prairie soils to the more erosive, sandy soils of the Cross Timbers ecological
region. The APE is located on a dissected upland escarpment slightly sloping to the southwest. An
unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek dissects the northwestern corner of the APE and flows south
approximately 1.48 miles (mi) to the confluence of the two streams (see Figure 1.2). Elevations within
the APE range from 610 to 680 ft above modern sea level (amsl).
Vegetation and Geology
The DFW property is located within an environmental interface, known as an ecotone, between the
Northern Blackland Prairie and Eastern Cross Timbers ecoregions (McGowen et al. 1987). Variation
among each ecoregion is a direct result of the underlying regional geology (Diggs et al. 1999). The
natural divide between these two ecoregions is east of Big Bear Creek, which extends from the northwest
to the southeast through the western portion of the DFW property.
The Northern Blackland Prairie is distinguished from surrounding regions by gently rolling hills and finetextured, black, clay-rich soils that primarily support prairie vegetation (Griffith et al. 2007). Vertisols
dominate the Blackland Prairie ecoregion and consist of high clay content soils with significant shrink
and swell potential (Ressel 1981). Historical vegetation included little bluestem, big bluestem, yellow
Indiangrass, and tall dropseed. Most of the native prairie has been converted to cropland, non-native
pasture, and expanding urban uses around Dallas, Waco, Austin, and San Antonio.
The Eastern Cross Timbers region was historically characterized by a narrow strip of timbered, low hills
that are orientated along a north-to-south axis from Tishomingo, Oklahoma to Waco, Texas (Ferring
1994; McGowan et al. 1987). This region contains numerous hills that were once heavily wooded with
oak, walnut, and hickory trees supported by deep sandy soils (Hill 1901). Early pioneers referred to the
region as the Monte Grande (Grand Forest) and later the Lower Timbers. However, due to urban
expansion, agricultural development, and other modern activities, the natural vegetation has become
highly fragmented, and only a few large tracts of undisturbed woodlands remain today (Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department [TPWD] 2019).
The APE is underlain by the Cretaceous-age Woodbine (Kwb) and Eagle Ford (Kef) geological
formations (Figure 2.1). The Woodbine Formation is primarily sandstone and contains a small
percentage of siltstone, mudstone, and clay (McGowen et al. 1987, U.S. Geological Survey [USGS]
2019). Weathering of the Woodbine Formation has resulted in the formation of soils with a sandy
epipedon within the Cross Timbers ecoregion. The Eagle Ford Formation (Kef) is comprised of shale,
sandstone, and limestone dating to the Cretaceous (McGowen et al. 1987; Scoggins 2004) and
weathering of the formation results in the dark, clay-rich soils of the Blackland Prairie.

Soils
There are 12 soil map units within the APE (Figure 2.2; Table 2.1; Ressel 1981). The APE contains
soils typical of in situ soil development in upland settings within the Eastern Cross Timbers and Northern
Blackland Prairie regions. The majority (90.8 percent) of the soils mapped within the APE are
characteristic of the Eastern Cross Timbers region. Approximately 7.9 percent of the soils within the
APE are characteristic of the Northern Blackland Prairie while the remainder is comprised of water
impoundments. Soil data were viewed from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (Web Soil Survey 2019).

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and the Texas Historic Sites Atlas
(THSA) electronic databases, maintained by the THC, identified that there are no previously recorded
archeological sites, National Register properties or districts, historical markers, or cemeteries located
within the proposed APE (TASA 2018; THSA 2018). The TASA database depicts that one previous
archeological survey was conducted along the southwest and northwest boundaries of the APE (Figure
3.1). This survey was performed by AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) for the FAA and DFW in 2007 under
Antiquities Permit No. 4491. TASA records further indicate that 13 professional archeological surveys
have been previously conducted within 1 mi of the APE (Table 3.1). As a result of these previous
surveys, eight archeological sites have been documented within 1 mi of the APE (Table 3.2).

3.2 Cultural Resources Potential
In 2007 and 2008, ARC conducted intensive pedestrian surveys of 1,210 ac on the DFW property under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4491 and published their results in the report An Archaeological Survey
for Chesapeake Energy Corporation at DFW International Airport Dallas and Tarrant Counties, Texas
(Shelton et al. 2008). Through this study, three environmental zones were identified within the airport
that contain varying probabilities for the presence of cultural resources.
The current APE will have ground disturbances within the Eastern Cross Timbers, identified as Zone 2 by
the previous investigators (Shelton et al. 2008:17–19). Zone 2 is typified by a wide range of well-drained
soil types ranging from those with high clay content to sandy loams located on uplands, ridges, terraces,
tributary streams, and valleys. Accordingly, these soils supported a wide range of vegetation and dense
stands of hardwood trees during the prehistoric period. These upland soils are moderately well suited for
cropland, pastureland, or urban development and the area has been well utilized for agricultural purposes
since early historic settlement. Thus, Zone 2 is considered to have a high potential for containing both
prehistoric and historic-age sites (Shelton et al. 2008).
Direct APE
Prehistoric Resource Potential
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) for
Tarrant County indicates that the majority of the APE contains a moderate potential for shallowly buried
archeological deposits and a low to moderate potential for deeply buried archeological deposits in alluvial
settings within areas that have retained a reasonable degree of contextual integrity. However, background
review determined that approximately 22 ac in the northwestern portion of the APE is located within an
existing natural gas well pad site with an associated pipeline and detention pond. As such, that portion of
the APE does not contain a reasonable context and the potential is reduced to low. The remaining portion
of the APE features a low potential within the TxDOT PALM for containing shallow and deeply buried
prehistoric archeological resources.
Historic Period Resource Potential
During background review, a small, rural community was identified on historical aerial photographs and
maps in the southern half of the APE. The unnamed community was located approximately 1.5 mi
southwest of the City of Grapevine along County Road 648 (Mustang Drive). The 1895 Sam Street’s
DFW 121 Mustang Business Park Project
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.067

Map of Tarrant County illustrates that there were at least five houses within the APE. These homes were
identified as being owned or occupied by Mrs. A. Newton, B. P. Payne, John Davis, A. E. Rodolph, and
J. B. Fay. Three of the houses were located south of a wagon road (later the Fort Worth Cardinal Road;
present-day Mustang Drive) and the remaining two houses were located north of the road near the
northern APE boundary. The 1924 USDA Tarrant County soils map depicts three structures north of
Mustang Drive in the APE and a structure adjacent to the western APE boundary, south of Mustang
Drive. The 1931 USGS Grapevine 15-minute (1:64,000-scale) topographic map identifies four buildings
along the corridor of Mustang Drive. The 1936 Texas State Highway Department map of Tarrant County
indicates four buildings were located within or near the APE. A 1942 aerial photograph depicts at least
four farmsteads within the APE. Three of these farmsteads were located north of Mustang Drive. Each
of these farmsteads contained several associated buildings, including barns and outbuildings. The
southernmost farmstead had a large orchard between the farmhouse and present-day Mustang Drive. By
1956, an additional three houses had been constructed south of Mustang Drive and the southernmost
farmstead associated with the large orchard had been demolished. Development of the southern portion
of the APE continued into the 1960s with the construction of several additional houses and barns. After
properties were acquired by DFW in the late 1960s or early 1970s, most of the standing structures within
the APE were demolished between 1970 and 1979.
During a resources inventory survey performed by DFW staff in 1968, over 50 structures were recorded
within the APE. A similar inventory was conducted by DFW in 1988, during which the ruins of six
buildings were identified. In September 2018, IES biologists observed multiple historic-aged resources
within the APE during environmental surveys for the proposed project. As such, the APE is considered to
have a high potential for containing historic-period cultural resources.
Indirect APE Resource Potential
Based on a review of historic maps and aerial photographs, no historic-age standing structures or
architectural resources are present within the indirect APE.

The methods utilized during this survey satisfy the archeological survey standards for field investigations
recommended by the CTA (2002), as approved by the THC. Components of the survey included archival
and background research, pedestrian reconnaissance survey, intensive survey, archeological site
recording, and NRHP/SAL evaluation of each documented resource. Prior to fieldwork, the IES staff
conducted historical and archeological records reviews to determine the locations of previously recorded
resources within the APE and within a 1-mi radius of the direct APE (see Section 3.1). IES staff also
reviewed ecological, geologic, and soils data, historical and modern topographic maps, and aerial
photographs of the APE. Due to the variability in prehistoric and historic-period settlement patterns, land
use, and archeological site preservation within the APE, multiple survey and sampling methods were used
during this investigation, including the use of systematic shovel testing to locate and define archeological
sites.

4.1 Survey Methods
Pedestrian Survey
This cultural resources survey consisted of a pedestrian survey augmented by the excavation of
systematically-placed shovel tests. The pedestrian reconnaissance survey consisted of visual examination
of the ground surface and existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within the
APE. The pedestrian survey consisted of a multiple transect scheme, which was implemented across the
APE with a focus on areas determined during the background review to contain a high probability for the
occurrence of cultural resources. Transects were spaced in 30-m intervals orientated in a general
northeast-to-southwest orientation. Areas displaying high levels of disturbance were photographed to
document the lack of potential for intact archeological deposits. Other documentation methods included
narrative notes, maps, and shovel test records.
Intensive Survey
In previously unsurveyed and undisturbed portions of the APE with the potential for preserving
archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to the top of culturally sterile deposits, typically to
the argillic (Bt) or calcic (Bk) subsoil horizon. Shovel tests were at least 30 cm in diameter and were
hand-excavated in levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using 0.25-in
hardware cloth to facilitate the recovery of buried cultural materials. When high clay content soils were
encountered and could not be efficiently screened, material was manually troweled and inspected for
cultural deposits. The physical properties of each natural soil stratum were recorded and investigators
documented the results of each test on standardized shovel test forms. All shovel test locations were
recorded and plotted using Garmin or Trimble GeoXT handheld global positioning system (GPS) units.
Standards for archeological methods require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For this
reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are described in imperial units (e.g., in, ft,
mi) within this report, archeological measurements and observations are listed in metric units (e.g., cm,
m, km), unless historic-period artifact or architectural elements are more appropriately recorded in
imperial units.
Archival Research
Historical maps and aerial photographs encompassing the direct APE and indirect APE were reviewed to
determine the locations of historic-age (e.g., greater than 50 years old) structures. Deed/title research was
conducted for archeological sites that contained evidence of historic-period site components and historicperiod architectural resources. The purpose was to identify historically notable persons that were possibly
associated with any resource documented during this survey. Initial research was carried out by
examining deed and land title records from the Tarrant County Clerk’s Office (TCCO). The historic

significance of identified persons associated with each resource were also researched using The
Handbook of Texas Online database, online genealogy websites, and within various local history
publications.
Site Recording
An archeological site is typically considered to be a spatially discrete area containing cultural resources.
The recognition of a “site” is therefore contingent on content and extent. Content may refer to artifacts or
cultural features encountered in surface or subsurface contexts, architectural elements, or other
manifestations of past human activity. The extent of a site is based on the vertical and horizontal spatial
arrangement of these cultural remains. For surficial materials, a site is defined as five or more artifacts of
at least two different materials or functional classes located within the same vicinity (typically a 400
square meter [m2; 0.1-ac] area) or at least one cultural feature. The extent of the surface artifacts and
cultural features are then defined as the site boundary. When artifacts or features are encountered in
buried contexts, a site is defined within the extent of the culturally positive excavations. In cases where
an excavated survey sampling location (i.e., shovel test) yields cultural materials, additional delineation
excavations are conducted to define the boundary of the site. The spatial extent of the site is defined
within the extent of positive excavations and surface artifacts or features when both are present. In
addition, archival research can also be used to define the limits of some historic-period archeological
sites.
Cultural remains, meeting these criteria, are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site
Data Form, and submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) to be included in the
TASA database. Conversely, discovery of cultural materials that do not meet these criteria are considered
isolated occurrences of past human activity and are simply documented by location and content. Modern
materials and features (i.e., less than 50 years old) are not considered sites, with only location and content
noted during the survey. Depending on depositional integrity and cultural content, archeological sites can
be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as SALs. Cultural isolates and modern features
are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as SALs because of their failure to meet the
site definition and their inability to contribute important information to the understanding of history or
prehistory.

4.2 Site Evaluation
Each identified archeological site was plotted on the appropriate 7.5-minute USGS topographic map and a
scaled site map was prepared for each site. Field data were processed to evaluate site significance and
potential eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and designation as an SAL. When applicable, a variety of
data were used to assess site significance including temporal period, artifact density, artifact variety,
feature density, feature variety, feature preservation, stratigraphic integrity, and the amount of previous
disturbance.
National Register Evaluation Criteria
The assessment of significance of a cultural resource is based on federal guidelines and regulations. The
criteria for evaluating resources for inclusion in the NRHP are codified under the authority of the NHPA,
as amended (36 CFR 60.4 [a–d]), and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set forth
guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Federal regulations indicate that “[t]he term ‘eligible for
inclusion in the National Register’ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary
of the Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR 800.2[e]).
Based on Advisory Council guidelines, any cultural resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP is a historic property.
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, four criteria
for eligibility are applied. The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,

integrity of location, design, setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and:

Criterion B:
Criterion C:

Criterion D:

that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic
values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; or
that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history [36 CFR 60.4(a–d)].

The principal objective is to determine whether a cultural resource possesses the potential to contribute to
one or more of the above-defined criteria. Adequate information regarding site function, context, and
chronological placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential
for cultural resources investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal
period, and project design, determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural
resources is a particularly important objective during the inventory and evaluation processes. Criterion D
is generally associated with prehistoric, but also historic-era, archeological sites. Criteria A, B, and C
typically reflect association with historic-era resources, rarely with prehistoric sites. The objective of the
current project was to locate and define both the horizontal and vertical extents of any cultural resources,
document and describe those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for
NRHP eligibility.
State Antiquities Landmark Evaluation Criteria
For purposes of implementing the ACT, the THC is the statutorily created body responsible for protecting
and preserving SALs (9 TNRC 191). A SAL is an archeological site, archeological collection, ruin,
building, structure, cultural landscape, site, engineering feature, monument or other object, or district that
is eligible to be designated as a landmark or is already officially designated as a landmark. The State of
Texas considers all publicly-owned archeological sites and historic buildings and structures to have some
intrinsic historic value, and the ACT provides some level of protection for those sites, buildings, or
structures regardless of their size, character, or ability to currently yield data that will contribute important
information on the history or prehistory of Texas. Additionally, these publicly-owned archeological sites
and historic buildings and structures are protected from vandalism, or other actions meant to take, alter, or
destroy them, and information directly related to the specific location of archeological sites is restricted
from open records requests. However, not all cultural resources are equally significant to the history and
prehistory of Texas. Some archeological sites may not possess research value sufficient to warrant longterm preservation or investigations beyond survey level documentation, and some historic buildings and
structures retain minimal integrity due to damage or deterioration. Therefore, the issue of whether
cultural resources are significant and warrant preservation, and/or further research (such as archeological
testing and data recovery level investigations), is addressed through official landmark designation, permit
issuance, and rules associated with enforcement of the ACT. Archeological sites and historic buildings
and structures on lands belonging to state agencies or political subdivisions of the state of Texas are
eligible to be designated as landmarks (9 TNRC 191.091 and 191.092). Also protected, under 9 TNRC
191.094, are specially designated landmarks on private property.
Under the ACT at the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL. The THC uses one or more of the following criteria when assessing the
appropriateness of official landmark designation, and/or the need for further investigations under the ACT
permit process:

Criterion 1:
Criterion 2:
Criterion 3:
Criterion 4:
Criterion 5:

the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or
history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
the site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;
there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or alternatively,
further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting
when the site cannot be protected (13 TAC 26.10).

4.3 Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Artifacts encountered during fieldwork were identified,
inventoried, and returned to the context from which they were recovered. Representative samples and
temporally or functionally diagnostic artifacts were photographed. Records, correspondence, field notes,
forms, and other documentation will be included in the curation package. These documents and
photographs will be organized and catalogued according to CAR curation standards and submitted for
curation. All field-generated documents will be temporarily stored at the IES office and permanently
curated at UTSA CAR.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
During this survey, the direct APE was subjected to reconnaissance survey transects and a systematic
intensive survey. Pedestrian reconnaissance survey was conducted across the entire APE to determine the
extent of prior ground disturbances and assess the likelihood of encountering cultural resources. Ground
surface visibility was highly variable and irregular across the APE, ranging from 0 to 70 percent.
Intensive survey with systematic shovel test sampling was also conducted within previously undisturbed
portions of the APE during this survey. As a result, one historic-period archeological site (41TR316) was
documented within the direct APE. No cultural resources were encountered within the indirect APE.

5.1 Archeological Survey
During this survey, 89 shovel tests were excavated within the 244-ac APE (Figure 5.1). Shovel testing
was conducted within portions of the APE with the potential to contain buried cultural deposits
(Appendix A, Photographs 1 through 6). The remaining portion of the APE was determined to have
been significantly disturbed and contained negligible potential for subsurface cultural deposits.
Subsequently, these areas were visually assessed and photographed during pedestrian survey (Appendix
A, Photographs 7 through 8).
Soils exposed within shovel testing of the APE revealed a profile that transitioned from medium brown
sandy loam, in the western portion of the APE, to a dark grayish-brown clay or clay loam, near the eastern
boundary of the APE. Soils were generally characterized as sandy loam or sandy clay loam. Few
subsurface inclusions were observed throughout the APE. Soils ranged from a brown (7.5YR 4/3 and
4/4) sandy loam surface layer to a compact, dark brown (10YR 3/3) clay loam subsoil horizon. The
maximum depth of the shovel tests was approximately 70 cm below surface (cmbs) with the majority
terminating between 30 to 50 cmbs. In addition to shovel testing, subsurface exposures including animal
burrows, disturbed patches, and the exposed cut banks of an unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek were
examined (Appendix A, Photographs 19 through 22).
Archeologists observed large piles of construction debris and several, small scatters of modern trash
(plastic and metal containers, tires, etc.) within the APE (Appendix A, Photographs 23 through 26). In
addition, 27 historic-age features, including structural foundations, foundation remnants, wells, and a
stone chimney, and a sparse historic-period surface artifact scatter were observed within the APE. As a
result of this survey, site 41TR316 was documented and defined within the extent of historic-age features
and historic-period property parcel boundaries.

5.2 Encountered Resources
Site 41TR316
During the IES survey, newly documented historic-period archeological site 41TR316 was encountered
within the APE (Figure 5.2). The site was located on the midslope of an interfluvial ridge bordering an
unnamed tributary of Big Bear Creek. The site was located within undeveloped, densely overgrown land
bisected by Mustang Drive (Appendix B, Photographs 01 through 05). An overhead electric utility
easement crosses the site in a northeast-to-southwest orientation (Appendix B, Photographs 06 through
08). Site 41TR316 was documented within an area extending approximately 800 m north-to-south by
1,180 m east-to-west, encompassing approximately 47.3 ha (117 ac). The site was delineated based on
the distribution of archeological features, surface artifacts, positive and negative shovel tests, archival
research, observed disturbances, and the APE boundary.

Survey Observations
Ground surface visibility within the site area was generally very low with small sporadic patches of
ground visible in the southeastern portion of the site. Vegetation within and surrounding the site was
overgrown and consisted of dense woody shrubs, brier, poison ivy, and mixed hardwood and coniferous
forest. Investigators observed a low density scatter of surface artifacts that consisted of brick and brick
fragments, steel cans, scrap metal, bottle glass (colorless, amber, and green), window glass, metal wire,
concrete fragments, and recent debris. Investigators observed several brick piles containing cream-paste
three-hole bricks, horizontal hollow bricks, and machine-made red-paste bricks, some of which were
manufactured by the Ferris Brick Company (1910 to 1923; Steinbomer 1982).
During the survey and delineation of site 41TR316, IES investigators excavated 73 shovel tests which
exposed slightly variable soil profiles. Generally, the soil profile consisted of a brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy
loam overlying a dark brown (7.5YR 3/4) sandy clay. Along the northern boundary of the site, the soil
profile transitioned to a dark brown (10YR 3/3) loamy clay that overlaid a very dark grayish brown
(10YR 3/2) clay. Shovel test depths ranged from 35 to 70 cmbs. Artifacts were encountered within three
shovel tests (AG03, AG05, and AG07) at the site (Table 5.1). Subsurface artifacts consisted of colorless
lamp glass (n=1), machine-made brick and tile fragments (n=6), a wire nail (n=1), and a butchered bone
fragment (n=1) (Appendix B, Photographs 09 through 11).

Features
A total of 27 archeological features were documented at site 41TR316 (Table 5.2). These features,
consisting primarily of structure foundations and wells, were distributed across a large portion of the APE
and were concentrated at the locations of homesteads and farmsteads depicted on historic maps and aerial
photographs. Aerial photography from 1942 illustrates that the APE contained farmsteads belonging to a
small, rural community that included agricultural fields, pastures, and orchards (Figure 5.3). The
community expanded during the mid-20th century, as evidenced by 1968 aerial photographs (Figure 5.4).
Following the acquisition of these properties by DFW in the early to mid-1970s, most of the buildings
and structures associated with site 41TR316 were demolished and many of the former agricultural fields
and pastures fell into disuse and were replaced by dense, woody, secondary forest growth.
The features documented at site 41TR316 were located within 19 former (historic-age) property tracts
subdivided from the Alex Thompson Survey (Abstract 1532, patented on 13 February 1861) and the
Jonathan B. Fay Survey (Abstract 530, patented on 07 December 1854) prior to their acquisition in the
late 1960s by the City of Fort Worth for construction of DFW (see Figures 5.3 and 5.4). Early deed
records indicate the construction of several buildings within the APE during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. The locations of the features documented at site 41TR316 were cross-referenced with deed
records and a series of historic aerial photographs to determine the approximate date of construction.
Using public records provided by the TCCO, chains-of-title were was produced for each property tract
containing historic-age features to identify the possible former owner and evaluate the potential of the site
for NRHP eligibility under Criterion A and/or B (Appendix C).

Alex Thompson Survey – Tract 1A

Feature 1 was a raised rectangular foundation measuring 25 m by 15 m (Appendix B, Photographs 12
through 16). The foundation was raised approximately 1 m above the ground surface. Several anchor
bolts were present within this feature. At the time of survey, the eastern half of the feature was covered
and overgrown. The southeastern corner of the raised foundation contained a 2 m by 1.5 m concrete slab
with a red slip. Galvanized steel flashing was located within the central portion of the foundation.
Cylindrical concrete foundation piers were located within the remaining portions of the feature. Although
the immediate area within and surrounding the foundation was heavily forested, historical aerial imagery
depicts this structure as constructed between 1942 and 1953. It pertained to the main domestic dwelling
located within Tract 1A. Based on deed records and site observations, Feature 1 most likely pertained to
the ownership of the property by the Lipscomb or Bunnell families (Appendix C, Table 1).
5.2.1.2.2

Alex Thompson Survey – Tract 2A

Feature 2 was a concrete slab measuring approximately 3 m by 4 m (Appendix B, Photograph 17). The
slab was located approximately 42 m southwest of Feature 5. At the time of survey, a portion of the slab
was buried, while the exposed portion of the slab was in a slight state of deterioration. Feature 2 was
located in proximity to a large barn or animal enclosure visible on a 1942 aerial photograph. It is
undetermined what function this slab served within the context of the farmstead.
Feature 3 was an approximately 3.5-m-by-2.5-m concrete slab located approximately 60 m southwest of
Feature 5 (Appendix B, Photograph 18). The slab was largely covered with leaf litter and soil. The
exposed portion of the slab was in a state of moderate deterioration. Feature 3 was located in proximity to

Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.067

a large barn or animal enclosure visible on the 1942 aerial photograph. The function of this slab was
indeterminate.
Feature 4 was a raised rectangular foundation measuring 2 m by 3 m (Appendix B, Photographs 19
through 21). This feature was located approximately 181 m southwest of Feature 5. The foundation was
raised approximately 8 cm from the ground surface. Several anchor bolts were present along the
foundation perimeter. At the time of survey, the western half of the feature was covered and overgrown.
The southeastern corner of the raised foundation contained a 1.5 m2 concrete slab. As the general
location of this feature was heavily forested in historical aerial imagery, the presence and function of the
foundation could not be discerned.
Based on deed records and site observations, Features 2, 3, and 4 most likely pertained to the ownership
of the property by the Dorris, Hollingsworth, or Crabtree families (Appendix C, Table 2).
5.2.1.2.3

Alex Thompson Survey – Tract 3

Feature 5 was a rectangular raised foundation and brick scatter measuring approximately 7 m by 24 m
(Appendix B, Photographs 22 and 23). The foundation was raised approximately 1 m above ground
surface on the southern edge and 4 cm on the northern edge. The southern edge featured an
approximately 5-m-wide multi-level slab covered with a brick scatter. The bricks were machine-made,
three-hole bricks comingled with solid bricks. Based on historic-period aerial imagery, the feature
pertained to a large barn servicing the farmstead that spanned Tracts 2A and 3.
Feature 6 was a stone-lined well. The well was located on minimally sloped terrain approximately 45 m
west of Feature 5. The well featured a machine-made brick collar approximately 85 cm in diameter
(Appendix B, Photograph 24). None of the bricks featured any observable manufacturer marks.
Historical deed cards indicate that Tract 3 contained a residence with a stone foundation, measuring 24 ft
by 36 ft, constructed in 1875. A barn and shed, both of which also had stone foundations, were
constructed on the property in 1906. None of the features documented within this tract can be definitively
identified as any of these earlier buildings. By 1942, the tract featured at least three buildings within a
large farmstead spanning Tracts 2A and 3. Based on deed records and site observations, the features
within Tract 3 most likely pertained to the ownership of the property by the Watson, Dorris,
Hollingsworth, or Crabtree families (Appendix C, Table 2).
5.2.1.2.4

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 1

Feature 7 was a raised concrete foundation measuring approximately 10 m by 11 m (Appendix B,
Photographs 25 through 28). The foundation was raised approximately 50 cm above the ground surface
on the eastern edge and approximately 25 cm above the ground surface on the western edge. The
easternmost 3 m of the foundation was a solid slab with fragments of linoleum attached to the surface.
Cylindrical concrete foundation piers were located within the remaining portions of the feature.
Numerous anchor bolts were embedded within the raised foundation. An approximately 6-m-tall
flagstone chimney was observed standing along the central portion of the northern edge of the feature.
Aerial imagery depicts Feature 7 as early as 1942. It is likely this feature represented the primary
domestic dwelling of the farmstead located on this parcel.
Feature 8 was an L-shaped, raised concrete foundation measuring approximately 19 m by 11 m
(Appendix B, Photographs 29 through 30). This feature was located approximately 50 m northnortheast of Feature 7. The foundation was raised approximately 25 cm above the ground surface.
Several anchor bolts were embedded within the raised foundation. This feature is clearly visible on
historic-period aerial imagery as early as 1968. Although earlier aerial images exist for this location, the
presence of this feature is undiscernible. Based on the configuration of this feature within the site, it is
likely this foundation pertained to an elongated livestock enclosure associated with the dwelling located at
Feature 7.

IES Project No. 03.006.067

Feature 9 was a rectangular, raised concrete foundation measuring approximately 4 m by 9 m (Appendix
B, Photographs 31 and 32). The foundation was located approximately 30 m north-northeast of
Feature 7. The foundation was raised approximately 4 cm above ground surface and was approximately
20 cm wide. Several anchor bolts were present within this feature. Based on a review of aerial imagery,
this foundation served as a small, secondary dwelling or shed.
Feature 10 was a pair of raised rectangular concrete foundations measuring a total of 11 m by 8 m
(Appendix B, Photographs 33 and 34). This feature was located approximately 140 m north of Feature
7. The foundation was raised approximately 8 cm above the ground surface. Several anchor bolts were
present within this feature. At the time of survey, the eastern half of the feature was covered and
overgrown.
Feature 11 was a brick-and-mortar-lined well measuring approximately 75 cm in diameter enclosed
within a concrete well house (Appendix B, Photographs 35 and 36). The well feature was located on
slightly sloping terrain approximately 20 m north of Feature 7. The well collar and walls featured
machine-made bricks set in mortar. None of the bricks featured any observable manufacturer stamps.
The well featured a rectangular poured concrete enclosure or well house measuring 1 m by 1.75 m. The
walls of the well house extended approximately 1 to 2.5 m above the ground surface. The rim of the well
house walls features an incised edge for an inset lid. No evidence of the inset lid was present at the time
of survey.
Tarrant County deed cards indicate that Tract 1 contained multiple buildings dating to the late 19th and
early 20th centuries. The property featured a cottage with a stone foundation and box framing constructed
in 1873. This cottage measured 14 ft by 28 ft. Another cottage, measuring 28 ft by 40 ft was constructed
in 1906 and featured a brick foundation and box framing. Two barns featuring cement foundations and
iron siding were added to the property in 1929 and 1932. By 1942, the tract contained five to seven
buildings. Based on deed records and site observations, the features within Tract 1 most likely pertained
to the ownership of the property by the Payne and Self families (Appendix C, Table 3).
5.2.1.2.5

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 1A

Feature 12 was a concrete slab measuring approximately 2.5 m by 2 m (Appendix B, Photograph 37).
At the time of survey, the slab was largely covered by leaf litter and soil. The exposed portion of the slab
was in a state of slight deterioration. Historical aerial imagery suggests that Feature 12 serviced a
farmstead located approximately 50 m to the south. Feature 12 was part of a group of buildings clearly
visible on aerial photographs dating to 1953, 1968, and 1970. No further elements of the farmstead were
observed. Based on deed records and site observations, Feature 12 most likely pertained to the ownership
of the property by the Eakins family (Appendix C, Table 4).
5.2.1.2.6

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 1B

Feature 13 was a raised concrete foundation measuring approximately 25 m by 12 m (Appendix B,
Photographs 38 and 39). The foundation was raised approximately 50 cm above the ground surface on
the eastern edge and approximately 25 cm above the ground surface on the western edge. Large
cylindrical concrete foundation piers were located within the remaining portions of the feature. The
foundation was significantly eroded. Aerial imagery illustrates Feature 13 was constructed between 1964
and 1968. This foundation served as the main domestic dwelling in Tract 1B. Based on deed records and
site observations, Feature 13 most likely pertained to the ownership of the property by E. Frank Caster
(Appendix C, Table 5).
5.2.1.2.7

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 1C

Feature 14 was a concrete slab measuring approximately 7 m by 8 m (Appendix B, Photographs 40 and
41). At the time of survey, the entire slab was buried under leaf litter. The immediate area was
overgrown and featured small, woody growth. The southwestern corner of the slab contained a

IES Project No. 03.006.067

protruding steel pipe from its surface. Aerial photographs indicate Feature 14 was built between 1953
and 1964 and demolished in the 1970s. Based on historic-period aerial imagery, the feature pertained to a
secondary barn or shed servicing this parcel. Based on deed records and site observations, the feature
associated with Tract 1C most likely pertained to the ownership of the property by the Self or Walling
families (Appendix C, Table 6).
5.2.1.2.8

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 2A

Feature 15 was a filled, stone-lined well approximately 50 cm in diameter (Appendix B, Photographs
42 and 43). The well feature was located on generally level terrain within the margins of a utility
easement. A single flagstone cap was observed adjacent to the well. The well was filled with soil and
covered in herbaceous growth.
Tarrant County historical deed cards indicate a farmstead was located on Tract 2A as early as 1900.
Based on deed records and site observations, the well feature within Tract 2A most likely pertained to the
ownership of the property by the Morrow, Woodall, and Roberts families (Appendix C, Table 7).
5.2.1.2.9

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 9

Feature 16 was a raised foundation measuring approximately 12 m by 8 m (Appendix B, Photographs
44 through 47). The foundation was raised approximately 15 cm above the ground surface and featured
numerous anchor bolts protruding from the surface. Unlike the majority of the raised foundations
observed within this site, Feature 16 was constructed of concrete masonry unit (CMU) blocks covered in
mortar. Aerial imagery illustrates Feature 16 was constructed between 1942 and 1953. It is likely this
feature represented the main domestic dwelling of the farmstead located on this parcel. Based on deed
records and site observations, Feature 16 most likely pertained to the ownership of the property by the
Lattimore or Jordan families (Appendix C, Table 8).
5.2.1.2.10

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 9A1

Feature 17 was a raised rectangular concrete water trough measuring approximately 1 m by 0.7 m
(Appendix B, Photographs 48 through 49). The trough was approximately 0.75 cm tall with walls
measuring approximately 6 cm thick. It was located approximately 17 m south of Feature 18. At the time
of survey, the trough was filled with water and vegetal debris. Although the feature is not visible on
historic aerial imagery, it likely serviced the nearby farmstead visible on 1964 aerial photographs. Based
on deed records and site observations, Feature 17 most likely pertained to the ownership of the property
by the Jordan or Long families (Appendix C, Table 9).
5.2.1.2.11

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 9A3

Feature 18 was a raised concrete foundation measuring approximately 12 m by 8 m (Appendix B,
Photographs 50 through 52). The foundation was highly fragmentary with many exposed CMU blocks
visible. Only a single course of CMU blocks was exposed above the ground surface. A concrete staircase
extended from the central portion of the southern edge. Aerial imagery indicates Feature 18 was
constructed between 1953 and 1964. It is likely this feature represented the main domestic dwelling of
the farmstead located on this parcel. Based on deed records and site observations, Feature 18 most likely
pertained to the ownership of the property by the Jordan or Long families (Appendix C, Table 10).
5.2.1.2.12

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 9A4

Feature 19 was a raised concrete foundation measuring approximately 11 m by 9 m (Appendix B,
Photographs 53 through 57). The foundation was raised approximately 15 cm above the ground surface
and featured numerous anchor bolts protruding from the surface. Unlike the majority of the raised
foundations observed within this site, Feature 19 was constructed of CMU blocks clad with a veneer of
mortar. A CMU block platform was observed along the western edge of the foundation. The platform
DFW 121 Mustang Business Park Project
Cultural Resources Survey Report

IES Project No. 03.006.067

consisted of two courses of CMU blocks above the ground surface covered with a 10 cm thick concrete
cap. A disarticulated concrete staircase was observed approximately 10 m north of the platform.
Cylindrical and square concrete foundation piers were located within the central portion of the feature. A
1 m by 1.5 m concrete slab was observed along the southeastern corner of the foundation; however, the
slab appeared to have been previously disturbed and it is likely not in its original context. Aerial imagery
illustrates Feature 19 was constructed between 1953 and 1964. It is likely this feature represented the
main domestic dwelling of the farmstead located on this parcel. Based on deed records and site
observations, Feature 19 most likely pertained to the ownership of the property by the Jordan or Long
families (Appendix C, Table 11).
5.2.1.2.13

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 9A4A

Feature 20 was a raised concrete foundation measuring approximately 11 m by 17 m (Appendix B,
Photographs 58 through 60). The foundation was raised approximately 10 cm above the ground surface
and featured several anchor bolts protruding from the surface. A concrete stair or platform was observed
along the southern edge of the foundation. A scatter of loose and mortared sections of cream-colored,
three-hole bricks was located adjacent to the northeastern corner of the foundation. It is likely the
structure at this location featured brick siding. Historical aerial imagery indicates Feature 20 was
constructed between 1964 and 1968 and shared a driveway or access road to Mustang Drive with Features
16 and 19. It is likely this feature represented the primary domestic dwelling of the farmstead located on
this parcel. Based on deed records and site observations, Feature 20 most likely pertained to the
ownership of the property by the Jordan or Long families (Appendix C, Table 12).
5.2.1.2.14

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 9B

Feature 21 was an overgrown rectangular foundation measuring approximately 8 m by 11 m (Appendix
B, Photograph 61). The foundation was nearly level with the ground surface and was heavily
overgrown. The majority of the foundation was covered with leaf litter at the time of the survey. Visible
portions of the foundation were heavily eroded. According to historical aerial imagery, this foundation
was constructed between 1942 and 1953. This feature likely represented the main domestic dwelling on
this tract. Based on deed records and site observations, Feature 21 most likely pertained to the ownership
of the property by the Lattimore or Vann families (Appendix C, Table 13).
5.2.1.2.15

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 9B1

Feature 22 was a raised concrete foundation in a state of slight deterioration (Appendix B, Photograph
62). The foundation measured approximately 15 m by 9 m and was raised approximately 75 cm above
the ground surface. Aerial imagery indicates that Feature 22 was constructed between 1942 and 1953 and
served as the main domestic dwelling in Tract 9B1. Based on deed records and site observations, Feature
22 most likely pertained to the ownership of the property by the Lattimore or Vann families (Appendix
C, Table 14).
5.2.1.2.16

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 9B2

Feature 23 was a rectangular foundation measuring approximately 12 m by 15.5 m (Appendix B,
Photograph 63). The foundation was raised approximately 50 cm from the ground surface and was
heavily eroded. Several anchor bolts were observed protruding from the foundation. Aerial imagery
indicates that this foundation was constructed between 1953 and 1964 and served as the main dwelling of
the farmstead extending across Tracts 9B2 and 9B3.
Feature 24 was an approximately 11 m by 14 m rectangular foundation slab (Appendix B, Photograph
64). At the time of field survey, most of the foundation was overgrown and heavily eroded. The
southwestern corner of the foundation was visible and was raised approximately 15 cm above the ground
surface. Aerial imagery illustrates Feature 24 was constructed between 1953 and 1968 and was connected

to Mustang Drive. It is likely this feature represented a barn associated with the farmstead located on
Tracts 9B2 and 9B3. Based on deed records and site observations, Features 23 and 24 most likely pertain
to the ownership of the property by the Vann or Sutton families (Appendix C, Tables 15 and 16).
5.2.1.2.17

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 9C

Feature 25 was a rectangular enclosure measuring approximately 16 m by 7 m (Appendix B,
Photographs 65 through 67). The structure was constructed using horizontal hollow bricks. The walls
ranged from one to four courses tall (approximately 0.3 to 1.5 m tall). A fragment of molded concrete,
apparently forming a decorative capital on a spiral column, was also observed within the feature
(Appendix B, Photograph 68). Aerial imagery illustrates Feature 25 was constructed between 1942 and
1953. Based on deed records and site observations, Feature 25 most likely pertained to the ownership of
the property by the Lattimore or Rumfield families (Appendix C, Table 17).
5.2.1.2.18

Jonathan B. Fay Survey - Tract 9C1

Feature 26 was a raised concrete slab foundation measuring approximately 3 m by 5 m (Appendix B,
Photographs 69 through 70). The corners of the slab were eroded, while the remaining portions of the
foundation were intact and raised approximately 50 cm above the ground surface. Historical aerial
imagery depicts the foundation was constructed between 1953 and 1964 and pertained to a porch or
entryway to the main domestic dwelling.
Feature 27 was a concrete-lined well approximately 75 cm in diameter (Appendix B, Photograph 71).
The well was located approximately 5 m east of Feature 26. No collar was visible, and the inside of the
well was partially filled with leaves and modern debris. Based on deed records and site observations,
Features 26 and 27 most likely pertained to the ownership of the property by the Rumfield or Sanchez
families (Appendix C, Table 18).
Site Integrity and Prior Ground Disturbances
A background review of historic maps and aerial photographs indicate that much of the site has been
exposed to some degree of prior ground disturbance. These disturbances are primarily related to past
agricultural and pastoral activities during the late-19th and early 20th centuries and development of the
DFW property during the later portion of the 20th century. Historical aerial photographs, dating to 1942,
illustrate that the site consists of a rural agricultural community comprised of a series of farmsteads along
present-day Mustang Drive. By 1968, the community had expanded south of Mustang Drive to occupy
the extent of the archeological site boundary. Most of the standing structures were demolished by 1979,
following acquisition of the properties by the City of Fort Worth in the early-to-mid 1970s.
Between 1984 and 1986, multiple overhead electric transmission lines and a temporary access road were
erected in the southern half of the APE. By 1995, Mustang Drive had been expanded from an undivided
two-lane road to a divided four-lane road and an approximately 2-ac area within the center of the site was
graded and channelized to allow north-to-south water flow through culverts along Mustang Drive. An
overhead electric transmission line was also constructed through the central portion and eastern extent of
the site at this time and has since been regularly maintained. In 2008, a natural gas well pad with
associated infrastructure was constructed near the northern limits of the APE. Additionally, a buried
natural gas pipeline was installed that extended from the well pad to SH 121 along the western APE
boundary. In the early 2010s, an elevated ramp connecting SH 114 to SH 121 was constructed through
the eastern portion of the APE. The APE now consists almost entirely of dense, mixed, hardwood forest.
Site Summary
Site 41TR316 represents the historic-period site pertaining to a rural agricultural community from the
late-19th to the mid-20th centuries. The site is located in an area approximately 800 m northwest-tosoutheast by 1,180 m northeast-to-southwest, encompassing approximately 47.3 ha (117 ac) within the
DFW 121 Mustang Business Park Project
Cultural Resources Survey Report

APE. During the intensive archeological survey and site delineation, 73 shovel tests were excavated
within the site. Three shovel tests excavated within the site yielded nine artifacts comprised largely of
architectural-related items confined to the upper 40 cmbs. A total of 27 archeological features and a low
density historic-period surface artifact scatter and modern debris were observed. All of the features
identified within the site were related to domestic and agricultural buildings that were demolished in the
mid-1970s following the acquisition of the original properties by the City of Fort Worth for the
construction of DFW. Chains-of-title were produced to determine possible ownership of the former
property parcels that comprise the site (Appendix C). None of the individuals associated with the former
owners were listed in the Handbook of Texas, online genealogical research resources, or local history
volumes. Based on the site’s lack of association with a significant historical event(s) or person(s),
absence of important architectural features, and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, it
is recommended that site 41TR316 be considered not eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B,
C, or D nor considered for SAL designation.

41TR316

41TR316 was a newly recorded historic-period archeological site related to small, rural agricultural
community during the late 19th and mid-20th centuries. The site contained 27 historic-period features
and a surface artifact scatter that extended across 19 former property parcels. Based on the site’s lack
of association with a significant historical event(s) or person(s), the absence of important architectural
features, and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, site 41TR316 is recommended
not eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, C, or D nor considered for SAL designation.
No further evaluation or mitigation efforts are recommended for this site.
Therefore, it is the recommendation of IES that the DFW 121 Mustang Business Park project be
permitted to continue without the need for further cultural resources investigations. However, if any
cultural resources, other than those detailed within this report, are encountered during construction, the
operators should immediately stop construction activities in those areas. The project cultural resources
consultant should then be contacted to initiate further consultation with the THC/State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO) prior to resuming construction activities in the area of the inadvertent
discovery. In addition, if project designs change, and areas outside the APE detailed within this report are
to be impacted, additional field investigations may be required.
