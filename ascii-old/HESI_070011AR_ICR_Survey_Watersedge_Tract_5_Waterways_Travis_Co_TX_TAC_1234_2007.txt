MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Makar Properties, LLC (Makar), is proposing to develop the Watersedge tract, an
approximately 169-hectare (ha) (418-acre [ac]) property in east Austin, Travis County, Texas,
into a residential subdivision. The tract is situated north of the intersection of State Highway
(SH) 71 and Doctor Scott Drive, approximately 5.6 kilometers (km) (3.5 miles [mi]) east of
Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, and immediately northeast of Southeast Metropolitan
Park, a recreational facility administered by the Travis County Transportation and Natural
Resources Department, Park Division (Travis County). Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
(Horizon), had previously performed a wetland delineation that identified 5 areas of proposed
impacts along an ephemeral tributary of Onion Creek that may require permitting by the US
Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE). A jurisdictional assessment is currently
underway to determine whether or not the ephemeral stream constitutes a “waters of the US”
and, consequently, if the 5 areas of proposed impacts are subject to regulation under
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). A jurisdictional assessment and application to
permit impacts to potential “waters of the US” under Nationwide Permit No. 29 is being prepared
by Horizon (USACE Project No. SWF-2007-82). If federal jurisdiction is established, the
proposed development in the 5 impact areas would represent a publicly sponsored undertaking,
and Makar therefore would be required to evaluate the potential of the proposed project to
adversely affect significant cultural resources within the 5 proposed impact areas pursuant to
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
The 169-ha (418-ac) Watersedge tract is privately owned, and no federal or state lands
or funding are being used in support of the proposed development. The Area of Potential Effect
(APE) therefore consists only of the 5 areas of proposed impacts to potential “waters of the US”
that would be subject to permitting by the USACE. The 5 impact areas, designated as Impact
Areas 1 to 5, include 1 locality at which a water-quality detention pond would be constructed
(Impact Area 1) and 4 locations at which Makar proposes to construct residential road crossings
over the ephemeral stream (Impact Areas 2 to 5). Collectively, a total of 0.08 ha (0.20 ac) of
possible “waters of the US” would be impacted by proposed construction activities in the
5 impact areas. The APE includes the 0.08 ha (0.20 ac) of “waters of the US” that would be
subject to proposed impacts plus a 30-meter- (m-) (100-foot- [ft]) wide buffer zone on both sides
of the ephemeral stream’s banks.

Management Summary

Impact Area 1 would involve construction of a regional water-quality detention pond by
constructing an earthen dam and concrete outfall structure as well as excavating 259 m (850 ft)
of “waters of the US” to create an approximately 2.6-ha (6.5-ac) wet pond. Impact Areas 2 to 5
would involve installation of concrete box culverts and filling activities at 4 separate crossings of
the ephemeral stream and would result in impacts to 27 m (90 ft) of “waters of the US” in Impact
Area 2 and 21 m (70 ft) of “waters of the US” in Impact Areas 3, 4, and 5.
To meet its responsibilities under Section 106 of the NHPA, Makar contracted with
Horizon to conduct an intensive cultural resource survey of the APE, which consists of the
combined 0.08 ha (0.20 ac) of jurisdictional areas of “waters of the US” on the Watersedge tract
plus a 30-m- (100-ft-) wide buffer zone extending out from both banks of the ephemeral stream,
covering a total of 2.2 ha (5.4 ac). Three of the 5 USACE jurisdictional areas (Impact Areas 3,
4, and 5) are situated in an upland area in which Holocene alluvial deposits were considered to
be unlikely or very shallow; in these 3 areas, Horizon archeologists conducted an intensive
pedestrian survey entailing surface inspection, subsurface shovel testing, and excavation of
1 backhoe trench to determine the presence or absence of cultural materials. The remaining
2 jurisdictional areas (Impact Areas 1 and 2) were apparently located in alluvial settings closer
to Onion Creek. A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas (Atlas) indicated that 2 previously recorded archeological sites (41TV446 and
41TV447) had been recorded by The University of Texas at Austin (UTA) in the 1970s in the
vicinity of Impact Areas 1 and 2, respectively. Horizon archeologists conducted intensive
pedestrian survey activities in these 2 areas entailing surface inspection, subsurface shovel
testing, and extensive backhoe trenching.
The survey resulted in the re-location and reinvestigation of 1 previously recorded
archeological site, 41TV446, in Impact Area 1. Site 41TV446 appears to contain stratified
aboriginal components, and the presence of a Pedernales dart point suggests that at least
1 occupation occurred during the Middle Archaic period (ca. 2000 to 1200 B.C.). Archeological
materials observed in buried contexts on the site include burned rock, chipped stone lithic debris
(including flakes and cores), burned chert cobbles, charcoal, bone, and mussel shell. A
concentrated deposit of burned limestone rocks and chert cobbles, burned dirt, charcoal, faunal
bone, and mussel shell in 1 backhoe trench excavated near the north end of the site may
represent a buried cultural feature. While the integrity of the site’s buried archeological deposits
cannot be fully evaluated based on survey-level data, the site may have potential to contribute
to an understanding of the prehistoric past under Criterion D of the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP); however, based on available information, the site is currently recommended as
being of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP.
Based on initial development plans provided by Makar, a small, ca. 10,000-square-ft
portion of site 41TV446 situated along the southeastern site boundary would be located within
the area of proposed impacts associated with construction of the water-quality detention pond in
Impact Area 1. Based on the survey-level information available about archeological deposits on
site 41TV446 and the unknown eligibility of the site, Horizon recommended to Makar that
proposed construction plans in Impact Area 1 be redesigned in such a way that any impacts to
archeological deposits on site 41TV446 be avoided. The alternative option likely would be to

iv

070011_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 5 USACE Jurisdictional Waterway Impact Areas
on the 418-Acre Watersedge Tract, Travis County, Texas

recommend archeological testing on the portion of site 41TV446 that would be impacted by
proposed construction to determine the NRHP eligibility of archeological deposits on that portion
of the site.
Based on this recommendation, Makar redesigned the layout and structure of the
proposed detention pond facility in Impact Area 1 so as to avoid any impacts to site 41TV446.
As a result of the pond redesign, the proposed undertaking would not result in any impacts to
41TV446. Thus, no further archeological investigations are recommended in Impact Area 1,
and it is recommended that construction in this area be cleared to proceed. Horizon
recommends that Makar clearly mark the boundaries of site 41TV446 prior to the start of
construction activities to ensure that the site is not inadvertently impacted during construction.
Horizon revisited the mapped location of a second previously recorded archeological
site, 41TV447, in the vicinity of Impact Area 2 and excavated 17 subsurface probes in the area,
including 13 shovel tests and 4 backhoe trenches. Despite these extensive survey efforts to relocate and reinvestigate site 41TV447, only 1 piece of lithic debitage was identified in the
general vicinity in which this site was mapped. It is possible that the location of site 41TV447
was incorrectly mapped during the original UTA survey or that its location has been misplotted
by site file management personnel at the THC or the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL). It is also possible that the ephemeral cultural remains observed by UTA in 1979, which
consisted only of a few pieces of lithic debitage and possible burned rock exposed in a road cut,
are no longer extant. Shovel tests and backhoe trenches excavated in the vicinity revealed
thick deposits of very dark brown to black Houston Black clay overlying limestone gravel
bedrock. The shrink-swell clays of the Houston Black series tend to have relatively low potential
to contain deeply buried archeological deposits, and any cultural materials associated with
these Blackland Prairie soils tend to be confined to the modern ground surface. Given the
geomorphological context and the low density and ephemeral character of cultural materials
originally observed by UTA in 1979, it is likely that any cultural remains on site 41TV447 lack
sufficient integrity to warrant further investigation. Site 41TV447 is recommended as ineligible
for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further investigations are recommended on this site.
One archeological site, 41TV446, was recorded in the vicinity of Impact Area 1 that is
recommended as of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP. Project-related facilities in
Impact Area 1 have been redesigned to ensure that construction would not result in any impacts
to this site. A second archeological site, 41TV447, had been previously recorded in the vicinity
of Impact Area 2; however, despite extensive survey-level efforts, this site was not re-located
during the current survey, and this site is believed to have either been misplotted on site maps
on file at the THC and TARL or to no longer exist. No cultural materials were encountered in
Impact Areas 3, 4, or 5. In accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4,
Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the
APE. As currently designed (including the redesigned facilities in Impact Area 1), no historic
properties have been identified in the APE that meet the criteria for listing on the NRHP
according to 36 CFR 60.4, no further cultural resources work is recommended in connection
with the proposed undertaking. However, in the event that any human remains or burial
furniture are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing

maintenance of project-related facilities, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should
cease immediately and the USACE should be notified of the discovery.

on the 418-Acre Watersedge Tract, Travis County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Makar Properties, LLC (Makar), is proposing to develop the Watersedge tract, an
approximately 169-hectare (ha) (418-acre [ac]) property in east Austin, Travis County, Texas,
into a residential subdivision (Figures 1 and 2). The tract is situated north of the intersection of
State Highway (SH) 71 and Doctor Scott Drive, approximately 5.6 kilometers (km) (3.5 miles
[mi]) east of Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, and immediately northeast of Southeast
Metropolitan Park (Makar proposes to deed 65.5 ac of the Watersedge tract bordering Onion
Creek to Travis County, which would develop the 65.5-ac tract as an extension of the existing
park facility). Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), had previously performed a
wetland delineation that identified 5 areas of proposed impacts along an ephemeral tributary of
Onion Creek that may require permitting by the US Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District
(USACE). A jurisdictional assessment is currently underway to determine whether or not the
ephemeral stream constitutes a “waters of the US” and, consequently, if the 5 areas of
proposed impacts are subject to regulation under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). A
jurisdictional assessment and application to permit impacts to potential “waters of the US” under
Nationwide Permit No. 29 is being prepared by Horizon (USACE Project No. SWF-2007-82). If
federal jurisdiction is established, the proposed development in the 5 impact areas would
represent a publicly sponsored undertaking and Makar therefore would be required to evaluate
the potential of the proposed project to adversely affect significant cultural resources within the
5 proposed impact areas pursuant to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
The 169-ha (418-ac) Watersedge tract is privately owned, and no federal or state lands
or funding are being used in support of the proposed development. The Area of Potential Effect
(APE) therefore consists only of the 5 areas of proposed impacts to potential “waters of the US”
that would be subject to permitting by the USACE. The 5 impact areas, designated as Impact
Areas 1 to 5, include 1 locality at which a water-quality detention pond would be constructed
(Impact Area 1) and 4 locations at which Makar proposes to construct residential road crossings
over the ephemeral stream (Impact Areas 2 to 5) (see Figures 1 and 2). Collectively, a total of
0.08 ha (0.20 ac) of possible “waters of the US” would be impacted by proposed construction
activities in the 5 impact areas (Table 1). The APE includes the 0.08 ha (0.20 ac) of “waters of
the US” that would be subject to proposed impacts plus a 30-meter- (m-) (100-foot- [ft]) wide
buffer zone on both sides of the ephemeral stream’s banks (see Table 1).

Impact Area 1 would involve construction of a water-quality detention pond by
constructing an earthen dam and concrete outfall structure as well as excavating 259 m (850 ft)
of “waters of the US” to create an approximately 2.6-ha (6.5-ac) wet pond. The pond would
consist of a deep pool portion and a sediment forebay with a planted wetland vegetation fringe
surrounding both portions of the pond. The pond would capture storm water runoff from the
increased impervious cover generated by the residential subdivision and facilitate the retention
of any sediment prior to the release of storm water downstream to Onion Creek.
Impact Areas 2 to 5 would involve installation of concrete box culverts and filling
activities at 4 separate crossings of the ephemeral stream and would result in impacts to 27 m
(90 ft) of “waters of the US” in Impact Area 2 and 21 m (70 ft) of “waters of the US” in Impact
Areas 3, 4, and 5. Installation of the box culverts at the proposed road crossings would allow for
increased flow volumes through the tributary, accommodate overland sheet flow during storm
events, and prevent overflow events from encroaching on the proposed residential subdivision.
To meet its responsibilities under Section 106 of the NHPA, Makar contracted with
Horizon to conduct an intensive cultural resource survey of the APE, which consists of the
combined 0.08 ha (0.20 ac) of jurisdictional areas of “waters of the US” on the Watersedge tract
plus a 30-m- (100-ft-) wide buffer zone extending out from both banks of the ephemeral stream,
covering a total of 2.2 ha (5.4 ac) (see Table 1). Three of the 5 USACE jurisdictional areas
(Impact Areas 3, 4, and 5) are situated in an upland area in which Holocene alluvial deposits
were considered to be unlikely or very shallow; in these 3 areas, Horizon archeologists
conducted an intensive pedestrian survey entailing surface inspection, subsurface shovel
testing, and excavation of 1 backhoe trench to determine the presence or absence of cultural
materials. The remaining 2 jurisdictional areas (Impact Areas 1 and 2) were apparently located
in alluvial settings closer to Onion Creek. A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC’s) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) indicated that 2 previously recorded

archeological sites, 41TV446 and 41TV447, had been recorded by The University of Texas at
Austin (UTA) in the 1970s in the vicinity of Impact Areas 1 and 2, respectively. Horizon
archeologists conducted intensive pedestrian survey activities in these 2 areas entailing surface
inspection, subsurface shovel testing, and extensive backhoe trenching.
This report presents the results of this cultural resource survey. Following this
introductory chapter, Chapters 2.0 and 3.0 present the environmental and cultural backgrounds
of the project area, respectively. Chapter 4.0 describes the research objectives, results of
archival research, and cultural resource survey methods implemented during the survey.
Chapter 5.0 presents the results of the cultural resource survey and describes cultural
resources documented during the survey, and Chapter 6.0 presents cultural resource
management recommendations for the project. Chapter 7.0 lists the references cited in the
report. A table that summarizes the locational, stratigraphic, and cultural resources data for
shovel tests and backhoe trenches excavated during the survey is presented in Appendix A
following the body of this report.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located in eastern Travis County, Texas, near the boundary of
3 significant physiographic provinces—the Edwards Plateau, the Blackland Prairie, and the Gulf
Coastal Plain. The Blackland Prairie, within which the project area is situated, is a narrow
physiographic zone between the Edwards Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the
east. It is a low, rolling land that extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of the
Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern Texas to the southern edge of
the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low topographic relief and poor drainage in which water
often ponds after rainstorms and streams flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau
and Balcones Escarpment are associated with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to
form a distinct boundary between uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower
plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp
(the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of
this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil,
vegetation, and animal life. The project area is situated on the terraces and adjacent uplands
south of the confluence of the Colorado River and Onion Creek. Elevations across the project
area range from approximately 122 m (400 ft) above mean sea level (amsl) along the northern
and western boundaries of the overall Watersedge tract on the banks of Onion Creek to as high
as 155 m (510 ft) amsl in upland settings toward the southern end of the tract.
Hydrologically, the study area is situated within the Colorado River basin immediately
south of the confluence of the Colorado River and Onion Creek. Onion Creek forms the
northern and northwestern boundary of the overall Watersedge tract, and the northeastern
corner of the property is located just south of the confluence of the Colorado River and Onion
Creek. The Colorado River, in turn, flows southeastward across the Blackland Prairie and the
Gulf Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short distance northeast of
Matagorda Bay. One prominent, unnamed drainage traverses the Watersedge tract. This
drainage arises in the uplands in the approximate center of the tract and flows north, becoming
progressively wider and more deeply incised, and ultimately discharges into Onion Creek about
500 m (1,640 ft) west of the confluence of Onion Creek and the Colorado River. This
ephemeral channel, which constitutes the “waters of the US” on the property along which all
5 proposed impact areas are located, contains only an intermittent flow from storm water runoff.

HJN 070011 AR

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

The channel is less than 1.0 m (3.3 ft) deep near its headwaters and in the vicinity of Impact
Areas 3, 4, and 5, though it is quite deeply incised toward its mouth on Onion Creek, achieving
a depth of 20 to 30 m (66 to 98 ft) in the vicinity of Impact Area 1.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The project area is underlain by a thick sequence of Cretaceous-age, sedimentary rock
strata. In Travis County, soils formed primarily over sedimentary deposits of Upper Cretaceous
age, and soil parent material consists of chalk, marl, limestone, and marly limestone (Werchan
et al. 1974). In the eastern part of Travis County, soils formed over Taylor Marl and the Navarro
Group of Upper Cretaceous age and the Midway Group of Paleocene age. Taylor Marl has
been further broken down into Bergstrom Clay, Pecan Gap Chalk, and Sprinkle Clay. These
formations are about 213 m (700 ft) thick. Sprinkle Clay and Bergstrom Clay consist of
calcareous clay, and Pecan Gap Chalk is chalky marl. An important feature of this geologic
group and the soils overlying it is the high shrink-swell potential (Werchan et al. 1974).
Specifically, the Watersedge tract is situated on 2 geological formations. The northern
one-third of the overall 169-ha (418-ac) Watersedge tract is situated on Holocene alluvium (Qal)
(Barnes 1974). Impact Areas 1 and 2 are mapped on Holocene alluvium. The southern twothirds of the tract is underlain by the Upper Cretaceous Pecan Gap Chalk formation (Kknm)
(Barnes 1974). Pecan Gap Chalk is a chalky or marly formation sandwiched between the
Sprinkle Claystone below and the Bergstrom Claystone above, though in the Austin area the
formation is primarily marly, with calcium carbonate content ranging from 25% to 75%. The
formation measures roughly 15 to 23 m (50 to 75 ft) in thickness depending on the variation in
facies relationships with the overlying Bergstrom Claystone. The Pecan Gap Chalk crops out
primarily east of Austin and does not appear south of Walnut Creek. It is faulted out on the
Hornsby Bend Fault north of Hornsby Bend to beyond Pilot Knob. Impact Areas 3, 4, and 5 are
situated on the portion of the overall project area underlain by the Pecan Gap Chalk formation.
Geomorphologically, the Watersedge tract is situated on Travis-Chaney Association,
which consists of deep, acidic, loamy soils overlying ancient alluvium of Pleistocene derivation.
This association consists of smooth, gently sloping and gently rolling soils that occupy high
terraces along rivers. Travis soils comprise about 28% and Chaney soils roughly 14% of this
association. The remaining 58% is composed primarily of Altoga, Burleson, Dougherty,
Hornsby, Houston Black, Lewisville, and Wilson soils (Werchan et al. 1974).
The overall Watersedge tract encompasses a complex mosaic of 13 mapped soil units,
including Altoga silty clay, 3 to 6% slopes, eroded (AgC2); Bergstrom silty clay loam, 0 to 1%
slopes (BgA); Chaney fine sandy loam, 1 to 2% slopes (ChB); Chaney fine sandy loam, 2 to 5%

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 5 USACE Jurisdictional Waterway Impact Areas
on the 418-Acre Watersedge Tract, Travis County, Texas

The northern one-third of the overall Watersedge tract, within which Impact Areas 1
and 2 are located, is situated on Holocene alluvium on the southern terraces of Onion Creek.
Specifically, Impact Area 1 is situated on Altoga silty clay, 3 to 6% slopes, eroded (AgC2), which
characterizes the immediate environs of the ephemeral stream, and Houston Black clay, 1 to
3% slopes (HnB), along the eastern and western edges of the impact area.
Altoga silty clay, 3 to 6% slopes, eroded (AgC2), occurs in long, narrow areas paralleling
major streams and consists of 0 to 13 centimeters (cm) (0 to 5 inches [in]) of hard, friable,
calcareous, light brownish-gray silty clay with a moderate, fine, subangular blocky to granular
structure (A1 horizon). This surficial soil zone is underlain from 13 to 61 cm (5 to 24 in) by hard,
friable, very pale brown silty clay loam with a granular structure with scattered calcium
carbonate (CaCO3) concretions that compose approximately 50% of the matrix (B21 horizon).
This soil horizon transitions gradually to hard, friable, pale yellow silty clay loam with soft
masses of segregated CaCO3 that compose about 70% of the matrix (B22 horizon) from 61 to
152 cm (24 to 60 in).
Houston Black clay, 1 to 3% slopes (HnB), is a gently sloping to gently undulating soil
that occupies smooth ridges or foot slopes and consists of 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) of extremely
hard, very dark gray clay with a moderate, fine, subangular blocky structure with few, fine,
strongly cemented CaCO3 concentrations (A11 horizon). This is underlain by very dark gray
clay with a fine to very fine, angular blocky structure and few strongly cemented CaCO3
concretions (A12 horizon) from 20 to 61 cm (8 to 24 in). Underlying this is extremely hard, dark
gray clay with few fine, strongly cemented CaCO3 concretions (A13 horizon) from 61 to 97 cm
(24 to 38 in) followed by extremely hard, grayish-brown clay with few medium, distinct mottles of
olive brown and many course, faint mottles of gray clay with weakly cemented CaCO3
concretions (AC1 horizon) from 97 to 203 cm (38 to 80 in). Finally, light olive-brown and gray
clay mottled with olive and brown clay containing few powdery masses of calcium carbonate
(AC2 horizon) occurs from 203 to 264 cm (80 to 104 in).
The southern two-thirds of the overall Watersedge tract, within which Impact Areas 3, 4,
and 5 are located, is situated on ancient Pleistocene alluvial terrace remnants on what are now
uplands south of Onion Creek. All 3 impact areas are situated on soils of the Ferris-Heiden
complex, 8 to 20% slopes, severely eroded (FhF3). Ferris-Heiden complex, 8 to 20% slopes,
severely eroded (FhF3), occupies rolling to hilly topography and has slopes predominantly in the
range of 10 to 15%. Areas of this soil are long and narrow, ranging from 8 to 81 ha (20 to
200 ac) in size. Ferris soils compose about 60% of this unit and Heiden soils make up the
remaining 40%. Heiden soils typically occur in smoother areas between gullies and on foot
slopes. The surface layer consists of dark grayish-brown clay about 38 cm (15 in) thick
underlain by grayish-brown clay mottled with olive-yellow clay to a depth of 127 cm (50 in),
below which is found yellow silty clay.
Regional climate has a profound effect on the morphology and formation of soil profiles
in Travis County (Werchan et al. 1974). Winter precipitation occurs primarily in the form of
persisting fogs, drizzles, and light showers that contribute to low soil temperature, poor aeration
of soils, and reduction of animal activity and plant growth. Spring rains are generally of short
duration and high intensity, and they tend to retard soil development through erosion. During

HJN 070011 AR

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

hot, dry summers, the clay soils of Travis County crack deeply, and subsequent rains wash the
surface soil into the cracks. This mixing of soils prevents the development of a B horizon in
most places. Rainfall quantities are sufficient to leach the calcium carbonate from the upper
horizons of some soils, but not enough to leach it out entirely. Most of the soils in the county
have specks, threads, or nodules of calcium carbonate throughout the profile. In a few soils,
most of the lime and plant nutrients are leached to a depth below the rooting zone, and clay
particles have moved down to form very slowly permeable horizons.
Aboriginal cultural resources are relatively common on alluvial terraces adjacent to
prominent streams and springs but are comparatively rare in upland settings. Away from
streams, clayey sediments are common on and near the modern ground surface throughout the
Blackland Prairie. Due to the relative antiquity of these sediments, combined with their shrinkswell characteristics and erosional potential, aboriginal cultural resources are rare in the
uplands. Where they do occur, they tend to consist of surficial scatters of artifacts that lack
depth and horizontal or vertical integrity. While significant aboriginal sites may occur at great
depths in streams associated with deep alluvial packages, significant aboriginal sites are
exceedingly rare in the uplands. Historic-age cultural resources may occur almost anywhere in
this region and tend to be visible on or near the modern ground surface.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Travis County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate is
typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and

10

070011_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 5 USACE Jurisdictional Waterway Impact Areas
on the 418-Acre Watersedge Tract, Travis County, Texas

fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas
manifest regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east
to west and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast
(Larkin and Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to
subtropical subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81 cm (32 in) and temperature
averages 19°C (67°F) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the warmest month) to
15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier periods lasting
from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30 to 64 cm (12 to 25 in), were
followed by abnormally wet years with 114 to 127 cm (45 to 50 in) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall
(Baker 1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91 cm (36 in) of rain that fell within an
18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 56-cm (22-in) deluge
that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935 (Baker 1975). Lower rainfall
amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so
frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from
west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture
is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely
penetrate into the region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.4

BIOTA

The project area is situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian
provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943).
Some species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The
boundary, characterized as “approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian
provinces passes through western Williamson County, northwest of the project area. Rainfall in
the Texan province is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite
(1948) as a C2 (moist subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.
Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica),
and hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this
soil type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas

11

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

include the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies. Some characteristic associations of the
Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a mixed stand of loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda) and blackjack and post oak in Bastrop County and a series of peat and bog
marshes distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At
least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert
pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens),
white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern
cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Sylvilagus
californicus), ground squirrel (Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginiana), hispid pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus
maniculatus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), ninebanded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and jaguar (Felis onca). Both species of Terrapene
known from the Austroriparian province—eastern box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle
(T. ornata)—occur in the Texan.
Sixteen species of lizards, including 7 grassland and 9 forest species, are also found,
including green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates),
common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale), glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis [grassland
species]), collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Texas spiny lizard (Sceloporus olivaceous),
Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Great Plains skink (Eumeces obsoletus
[forest species]). Only 5 species of urodele fauna are known from this area, including smallmouthed salamander (Ambystoma texanum), tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), and
eastern lesser siren (Siren intermedia), and the Texan province acts as a barrier to urodele
distribution between the endemic Balconian province fauna to the west and the Austroriparian
fauna to the east. Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely
distributed species, including eastern spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad
(Bufo valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus),
southern chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla
cinerea), North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens),
and narrow-mouthed toad (Microhyla carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross
from the Texan into the Austroriparian province include pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia),
Strecker’s chorus frog (Pseudacris streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea).
Other reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include 6-lined racerunner
(Aspidoscelis sexlineata), rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon
platirhinos), rough green snake (Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix),
western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris crepitans),
diamondback water snake (Nerodia rhombifer rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo
houstonensis).

Common bird species include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), killdeer (Charadrius
vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos).
Small herds of bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early
historic periods, but these species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological
Region. Prewitt (1981, 1985) demarcated the southeastern boundary of his Central Texas
Archeological Region at the town of Bastrop in Bastrop County, which borders Travis County on
the southeast. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally
nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of
the rest of North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed
markedly through time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the
PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point

HJN 070011 AR

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late
PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture
shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of
groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most
markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the
Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In
addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute
evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially
accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de

16

070011_arch_survey_report

Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as increased participation
on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement
of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was
greatly diminished.
The Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache Indians were well established in Central Texas by
the 14th century, and Comanche and Kiowa tribes arrived in the area by the 18th century 1 . The
first European known to have crossed the region was Domingo Terán de los Ríos, who made an
inspection tour to East Texas in 1691. When the Spanish moved their missions out of East
Texas in 1730, they relocated the missions of San Francisco de los Neches, Nuestra Señora de
la Purísima Concepción de los Hasinai, and San José de los Nazonis to locations near Barton
Springs. In 1827, the Mexican government granted Stephen F. Austin his third colony, Little
Colony, which was located east of the Colorado River and north and west of the Old San
Antonio Road. Mina (later Bastrop) became the headquarters of the colony, and Travis County
developed as an offshoot of Mina. Settlers moving into the area in the early 1830s included
Josiah and Mathias Wilbarger, Reuben Hornsby, Jacob M. Harrell, and John F. Webber. The
onset of the Texas Revolution delayed further settlement activity, and the news of the fall of the
Alamo prompted those settlers already in residence to flee.
Settlement resumed after the revolution, but it proceeded slowly because of the constant
threat of raids by the Comanche Indians. During the 1830s, a chain of small forts extended
from Bastrop northwest along Wilbarger’s Bend, Coleman Branch, Webber’s Prairie, and
Gilleland Creek, to Fort Colorado or Fort Prairie, 8 km (5 miles) east of the site of present-day
Austin. In June 1835, Thomas Jefferson Chambers surveyed part of an 8-league grant covering
the present-day site of Austin and the capitol. Sometime before 1837, William Barton settled
near the springs that were to bear his name. In 1837 or 1838, President Mirabeau B. Lamar
was on a buffalo hunt in the area and commented on its possibilities as a permanent site for the
capital. In 1838, the community of Waterloo (later Austin) consisted of 4 families, and about
20 families established homes at nearby Montopolis in 1839. When the Congress of the
Republic of Texas chose Waterloo as the site of the new capital, opponents were quick to point
out the disadvantages—the site's proximity to the frontier, the lack of timber, the poor soil, and
the threat of Indian raids. In spite of this opposition, however, the new capital—renamed Austin
in honor of Stephen F. Austin—was approved on 19 January 1840. A few days later, the
Congress established Travis County, naming it in honor of William Barret Travis and making
Austin its county seat. An election for county officials was held in February 1840, at which time
the population was reported to be 856. The initial boundaries of Travis County included roughly

40,000 square miles. Counties that were later carved from Travis County include Callahan
(1858), Coleman (1858), Comal (1846), Gillespie (1848), Hays (1848), Burnet (1852), Brown
(1856), Lampasas (1856), Eastland (1858), Runnels (1858), and Taylor (1858). Sam Houston
moved the government of the Republic of Texas from Austin to Houston when Mexican troops
invaded San Antonio in March 1842. When he tried to have the government archives removed
as well, Austin citizens resisted with the Archives War. The Texas Congress held sessions at
Washington-on-the-Brazos from 1842 to 1845, but the convention that drafted the Constitution
of 1845 met in Austin in July 1845, and by October the rest of the government had returned to
the capital city. The first legislature of the new state convened in Austin in February 1846.
The late 1840s and early 1850s were building years for Austin and Travis County, with
much of the growth fed by the presence of the state government—the Governor's Mansion,
office buildings, hotels, new homes, and newspapers. In 1850, Travis County had a population
of 3,138, of whom 2,336 were white, 791 were slaves, and 11 were free blacks; by 1860, the
number of residents had more than doubled to 8,080, with 4,931 of them white, 3,136 slaves,
and 13 free blacks. Although the city of Austin grew faster than the county as a whole—its
population rose from 629 in 1850 to 3,494 in 1860—most county residents lived in small
communities. Pflugerville and Del Valle were the most prominent of these communities, but
rural post offices were also established at Bluff Springs, Webberville, Merrilltown, Gilleland,
Cage’s Mill, and Hornsby Bend. During the 1850s, the amount of land in farms in what was
then Travis County increased from 73,300 acres to 1,363,500 acres. Corn was the primary field
crop, while cattle and sheep were the principal livestock. In 1860, farmers produced
137,700 bushels of corn and 27,900 bushels of wheat and had 58,000 cattle and 11,800 sheep.
The earliest schools in Travis County were private institutions that usually met in private
homes or in space donated by a church or Masonic lodge. More elaborate private facilities
began to appear by the late 1840s, including Colorado Female College in 1848, Austin Male
and Female Academy in 1849, Austin Female Academy in 1850, and Austin Collegiate Female
Institute in 1852. By 1850, Travis County also had 6 public schools serving a scholastic
population of 183. The county was divided into 19 common school districts in 1852. The state
established the Asylum for the Blind in Austin in 1856 and the Deaf and Dumb School in 1857.
Travis County became a center for higher education in the 1880s with the establishment of the
University of Texas in 1881, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute in 1881, and Saint
Edward's University in 1885. Samuel Huston College began holding classes in the 1890s. The
Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary opened in 1902, Texas Wesleyan College Academy
in 1912, Concordia Lutheran College in 1926, and the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the
Southwest in 1952. Austin Community College began operations in 1972. The availability of
schools resulted in a high level of education for a large portion of the county’s population. In the
1940s, while more rural areas of the state reported that less than 10% of their population over
the age of 25 had high school diplomas, nearly 20% of Travis County residents had graduated.
By 1980, that number had jumped to 75%.
The earliest churches in Travis County were the Catholic missions relocated to the area
by the Spanish in 1730, but these were moved to San Antonio in 1731, and it was more than a
century before any organized religious practices were firmly established. In the 1830s, a variety

18

070011_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 5 USACE Jurisdictional Waterway Impact Areas
on the 418-Acre Watersedge Tract, Travis County, Texas

of religious groups began to appear—Methodist circuit riders held services along Gilleland
Creek in 1837 or 1838; Presbyterians organized a church in Austin in October 1839; Mormons
settled near Fort Coleman, Webberville, and Hornsby Bend in the late 1830s; and Catholic
priests, among them Jean Marie Odin, returned to the area in 1840. A Baptist church and a
Church of Christ were organized in Austin in 1847, a Lutheran church was established in New
Sweden and a Jewish synagogue in Austin began in 1876, and a Christian Science church
formed in Austin in 1889. In the early 1980s, Travis County’s 266 churches had an estimated
combined membership of 194,194; Catholic, Southern Baptist, and United Methodist were the
largest denominations.
In spite of the rapid growth that Travis County experienced during the 1850s, the area
was at that time still very much at the edge of the frontier. The absence of railroads meant that
goods had to be shipped by wagon to and from Houston and Port Lavaca, and poor roads
meant that goods sometimes could not be shipped at all. In 1852, the Austin Railroad
Association was established to encourage railroad construction to the area, and considerable
progress had been made by the late 1850s; however, the Civil War intervened, and work on
railroad acquisition was postponed. The Secession Convention convened in Austin on
28 January 1861. Although a group of Austin citizens staged a demonstration in favor of
secession, Unionist sentiment was high, and Travis County residents voted against secession,
704 to 450. Nevertheless, when the Civil War began, Travis County provided several hundred
volunteers, among them the Travis Rifles, the Tom Green Rifles, the Capitol Guard, and the
Austin City Light Infantry. In the 2 months between the end of the war and the arrival of federal
troops in the county, looting of farms and businesses was common. Although the inevitable
clashes between the Unionist forces and the former rebels resulted in the arrest of as many as
30 people per day, the presence of federal troops served to curb much of the lawlessness. By
early 1866, most of the federal soldiers had been mustered out of service, leaving only about
200 men to police the Austin area until the end of the military occupation in 1870. Austin was
the site of the constitutional conventions of 1866 and 1868-69 and witnessed both the removal
of Governor James W. Throckmorton in 1867 and the Coke-Davis Controversy in 1874. In the
gubernatorial election of 1869, Travis County residents favored Andrew J. Hamilton to Edmund
J. Davis by a margin of 798 to 593.
Like most areas in the south, Travis County suffered considerable economic hardship
immediately after the Civil War and throughout the Reconstruction period. Between 1864 and
1866, the county as a whole experienced a 49% loss in property tax receipts. Roughly 2/3 of
this property loss was in slaves, with the rest coming from declines in farm and livestock values,
each of which fell 25 to 40%. The county began to show signs of recovery by 1880. The overall
population rose from 13,153 in 1870 to 27,028 in 1880, and the 1880 census reported
1,912 farms, an increase of 656 over the 1870 totals. The amount of improved land rose from
83,200 acres in 1870 to 139,800 in 1880. Field crops such as corn, cotton, wheat, and oats
took up nearly half of the improved farmland, while livestock dominated the rest.
Economic recovery was facilitated by the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central
Railway, which completed its track to Austin in 1871, and the International and Great Northern
Railroad, which was built between Rockdale and Austin in 1876 and completed from Austin to

Laredo in 1881. The Austin and Northwestern Railroad laid track between Austin and Burnet in
1882, and the Missouri, Kansas and Texas line arrived in 1904. Communities besides Austin
that benefited directly from easy railroad access included Pflugerville, Manor, Oak Hill, and
Manchaca. After the war, many former slaves remained in the area. In the year after the war,
the black population increased by 60%, while the white population rose by only 12%. By 1870,
black residents numbered 4,647, comprising 35% of the county's total population. Clarksville,
Kincheonville, Masontown, and Wheatville were among the communities established by former
slaves. The number of black residents in Travis County continued to increase steadily, reaching
13,299 in 1900. It fluctuated between 13,000 and 15,000 from 1900 to 1930, but increased
rapidly thereafter, rising to 22,493 in 1950, 32,270 in 1970, and 63,173 in 1990. Because other
segments of the population grew at an even faster rate, the percentage of black residents, with
respect to the total population, declined significantly, falling to 20% by 1930 and 11% by 1990.
Contributing to the shift in the ethnic makeup of the county was a variety of immigrant groups,
the most prominent of which were German, Swedish, and Mexican. By the turn of the century,
8% of the population was composed of natives of 1 of these countries. Although the early
Swedish and German settlers contributed to the diversity of Travis County through their religious
and educational institutions, the Mexican influence was also reinforced by the continued arrival
of large numbers of new immigrants fleeing the unrest of the Mexican Revolution in the early
20th century. The 1930 census reported that 10,225 residents, or 13% of the county’s total
population, were of Hispanic descent; by 1990, the number of Hispanic residents had risen to
121,689, or 21%.
In 1890, Travis County had 36,322 residents. Of these, 14,575 lived in Austin, which
was fast outgrowing its efforts to become a modern city. Innovations and improvements in
progress at that time included a trolley system and water-generated electricity, but most of its
streets remained unpaved. By the turn of the century several hundred assorted businesses
filled the needs of the 22,000 Austin residents. Yet, in spite of this rapid increase in Austin’s
population, the majority of the county’s residents lived on farms or in smaller towns, and
agriculture dominated the area economy. Cotton became the principal field crop in the late
1880s and remained so for more than 60 years. The 1890 census reported 65,000 acres—
nearly 30% of the county's improved farmland—planted in cotton; by the turn of the century, the
amount of land devoted to cotton had increased to 113,300 acres, or 56% of the improved
farmland. However, as more marginal land was used and the soil became depleted, production
levels fell; in 1930, 143,000 acres produced only 19,000 bales. By the late 1950s, cotton
accounted for only 26% of the total cropland harvested, and by 1980 it had fallen to only 8%.
Farm tenancy had increased steadily since the 1890s and peaked in 1930, with tenants
operating 2/3 of the 3,642 farms. The number of farms fell by more than 1,000 in the 1930s, as
many tenant farmers either moved away or turned to other occupations. Farmers who remained
in the area began to devote more of their resources to crops other than cotton and to livestock.
The number of cattle increased from 32,000 in 1920 and to 51,000 in 1950; the number of
sheep and goats increased as well, boosting wool and mohair production from 23,600 and
4,292 pounds, respectively, in 1920, and to 127,800 and 183,600 pounds in 1959. By the late
1960s, hay and sorghum combined to account for 60% of the cropland harvested.

The Great Depression was slow to hit Travis County, but, by the mid-1930s, many
people were unemployed and very glad of the New Deal programs that resulted in work paving
streets; building bridges, sewers, and parks; and constructing the tower of the University of
Texas campus. In part because of the job opportunities made available through relief projects,
state government, and the university community, the population increased by 43% in the 1930s,
rising from 77,777 in 1930 to 111,053 in 1940. One major job-producing project in the 1930s
was the construction of a series of dams on the Colorado River. Austin and Travis County had
begun efforts to tame the Colorado as early as 1869, when the army built a pontoon bridge
across the river. In 1893, the City of Austin completed a dam designed to provide power for its
water and electrical systems. By 1899, the city was already experiencing power shortfalls, and
a major flood in 1900 destroyed the dam. Another flood in 1915 washed out the repairs that
were underway, and the project was abandoned. The flood of 1935 put much of downtown
Austin under water, and the area’s interest in a lasting flood-control system was renewed. The
Lower Colorado River Authority was established and a series of dams was built, forming Lake
Austin, Lake Travis, Lake Buchanan, Lake Lyndon B. Johnson, Inks Lake, and Lake Marble
Falls. Travis County also profited from the establishment of several military bases. Camp
Mabry in northwest Austin, established as the main Texas National Guard facility in 1890,
served as an army training center during World War I. After the US became involved in World
War II, the Del Valle Army Air Base, soon renamed Bergstrom Army Air Field, was established
in southeast Travis County. After the war was over, the presence of military personnel
continued to bring changes to the county. Thousands of returning veterans enrolled in the local
colleges and universities, greatly increasing the student population as well as intensifying the
demand for housing and the growth of service industries.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Travis County underwent 2 significant developments. The first
of these was desegregation. The Sweatt v. Painter decision in 1950 pushed the University of
Texas to the forefront in the fight for civil rights, leading it to become the first southern university
to admit blacks as undergraduates, although it was not until 1962 that all of the university’s
facilities were fully integrated. Public schools in Travis County began to follow suit in 1955.
Local Mexican-American organizations also achieved a measure of success against
discriminatory practices. Some local businesses resisted these changes, prompting strikes and
protests in the 1960s, but in the end desegregation was accomplished without the violence
prevalent in other urban areas of the country. The change became even more visible as blacks
and Hispanics were elected to public office—Wilhelmina Delco to the school board in 1968 and
to the Texas House of Representatives in 1976; Berl Handcox to the Austin city council in 1971;
Richard Moya to the Travis County commissioner’s court in 1970; and Gonzalo Barrientos to the
Texas House of Representatives in 1974.
The second major development was the
establishment of several high-tech industries. In 1951, a small, local company became Texas
Instruments, and in 1955 Tracor, Incorporated, made Austin its base of operations.
International Business Machines opened an Austin branch in 1967, followed by Motorola in
1974. These companies, along with Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation
(1983), Dell Computers (1984), and Sematech (1988), became the county’s largest employers.
From the end of Reconstruction to the present, most Travis County residents chose to
support Democratic presidential candidates, with exceptions in 1896, 1928, 1952, 1956, 1972,

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

and 1984. Occasionally, a third-party candidate drew a sizable portion of the vote, but only 3 of
them—the Greenback-Labor candidate in 1880, George Wallace in 1968, and John Anderson in
1984—garnered sufficient support to affect the county’s overall election results. In state
elections, Travis County residents were staunchly Democratic. In the early 1980s, 63% of the
land in Travis County was devoted to farms and ranches. About 23% of the farmland was under
cultivation, with sorghum, hay, wheat, and cotton accounting for nearly 70% of the 94,000 acres
harvested; other crops included potatoes, sweet potatoes, peaches, and pecans. Sixty-six
percent of the county’s $32 million in agricultural receipts came from livestock and livestock
products, the most important ones being cattle, milk, sheep, wool, and hogs. Although
agriculture remained an important aspect of the local economy, farm receipts were greatly
surpassed by the income generated by non-agricultural industries. Professional and related
services, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and government administration involved
70% of the work force in the 1980s; of the rest, 7% were self-employed and 3% employed
outside the county. Since shortly after the turn of the century, the majority of Travis County
residents had resided in the City of Austin. The jobs made available by the growth of the hightech industries reinforced that trend, and, by 1970, 85% of the 295,516 residents lived in the
capital city. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, residential development near Lake Travis
encouraged many people to move away from the city, and although Austin continued to grow at
a rapid pace, the number of residents choosing to live near the lake and in northern and
southern suburbs increased at an even faster rate. By 1990, Lago Vista (2,199), Jonestown
(1,250), Briarcliff (335), Lakeway (4,044), and Pflugerville (4,444) in Travis County, as well as
Round Rock and even Georgetown in Williamson County, had become popular alternatives to
living in Austin. Like the rest of Texas, Travis County weathered a serious economic downturn
in the mid-1980s; newly-built office space sat empty, and many people lost their jobs. Added to
this was news that Bergstrom Air Force Base was scheduled to close. In the early 1990s,
however, plans were underway to convert the Bergstrom site into a new municipal airport, and
the county was looking forward to a period of growth. The population of Travis County was
reported at 576,407 in 1990, an increase of 37% from 1980. Among the area’s most prevalent
concerns was that future growth should not destroy the ecological balance of environmentally
sensitive areas in the western hills.

on the 418-Acre Watersedge Tract, Travis County, Texas

4.0 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

The cultural resource survey described in this report was undertaken with 3 primary
research goals in mind:
1. To locate and record cultural resources occurring within the designated survey areas
2. To provide preliminary assessments of the significance of these resources regarding
their potential for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
3. To make recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP assessments
The first of these goals was accomplished by means of a review of documentation on file
at the THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas), the National Park Service’s (NPS’s)
online National Register Information System (NRIS), the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), the General Land Office (GLO), and the Texas State Historical Association’s
and the General Libraries at The University of Texas at Austin’s Handbook of Texas Online, as
well as a program of intensive survey of the survey area. The assessments of significance,
evaluations of NRHP eligibility, and recommendations concerning the treatment options for the
cultural resources recorded during this survey are presented in Chapter 5.0, Results of
Investigations, and Chapter 6.0, Summary and Recommendations. The rest of this chapter
presents the results of archival research, the methodological background for the current
investigations, and the specific survey methods used in the field.

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating the survey fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed existing archival
documentation to acquire information on (1) previous cultural resource investigations conducted
in the vicinity of the project area, and (2) any previously documented cultural resource
properties within or immediately adjacent to the survey areas associated with the 5 proposed
impact areas. The entire 169-ha (418-ac) Watersedge tract had been previously surveyed in
the 1970s by UTA, and 6 archeological sites were recorded at that time on what is now the
proposed Watersedge tract (Table 2). Based on information recorded on UTA site survey cards
on file on the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database, 4 of these
6 previously recorded sites (41TV444, 41TV445, 41TV447, and 41TV452) were described as

relatively ephemeral surface scatters of aboriginal artifacts in disturbed contexts. In addition to
the aboriginal component, site 41TV444 was also described as possessing a late-19th-century
historic component consisting of a surface scatter of historic ceramics, brick fragments, and
metal scrap, though all structures had been removed or demolished from the site. The
remaining 2 of these 6 sites (41TV17 and 41TV446), however, were described as aboriginal
campsites having potentially deep archeological deposits, though the horizontal and vertical
extent of the deposits were investigated only informally in the 1970s based on surface
inspections.
In addition to the 6 sites recorded by UTA in the 1970s, a 7th previously recorded site,
41TV1862, is located just southwest of the Watersedge property boundary on the existing
Southeast Metropolitan Park facility. Site 41TV1862, also known as the Jones-NorwoodOatman Cemetery, is a historic-age cemetery that was originally recorded as an archeological
site by Hicks & Company in 1998 during a cultural resources survey conducted for the nowexisting Southeast Metropolitan Park facility (Karbula et al. 1998). The site was described as a
historic-age cemetery dating between 1880 and 1921 with 8 marked burials and at least
5 unmarked burials, one of which was a double-burial. Information on 4 of the 5 unmarked
(albeit known) burials was obtained through discussions with an informant who was related to all
of the persons known to be buried in the cemetery save one and who provided names (though
not dates of death) for 4 of the 5 unmarked burials.

on the 418-Acre Watersedge Tract, Travis County, Texas

Based on the archival research, 2 of the archeological sites that had been originally
recorded by UTA in the 1970s appeared to be located within or immediately adjacent to 2 of the
5 proposed impact areas. Site 41TV446 was mapped on the western side of the ephemeral
tributary in the vicinity of Impact Area 1, the proposed water-quality detention pond, and site
41TV447 was mapped on the eastern side of this tributary in the vicinity of Impact Area 2, one
of the proposed residential road crossings. No previously recorded sites were present in the
immediate vicinity of Impact Areas 3, 4, or 5.

4.2

SURVEY METHODS

Although the property that now comprises the 169-ha (418-ac) Watersedge tract was
previously surveyed for cultural resources in its entirety by UTA in the 1970s, Horizon proposed
to intensively re-survey the APE associated with the current undertaking, which consists of
5 impact areas situated along the ephemeral drainage on the Watersedge tract. The 5 impact
areas collectively cover an area of 2.2 ha (5.4 ac), including the 0.08 ha (0.20 ac) of “waters of
the US” that would be subject to proposed impacts plus a 30-m- (100-ft) wide buffer zone on
both sides of the ephemeral stream’s banks (see Table 1).
Because the APE had been previously surveyed in its entirety, Horizon’s survey efforts
focused on re-locating the 2 previously recorded archeological sites that had been mapped as
occurring in the vicinity of Impact Areas 1 (i.e., site 41TV446) and 2 (i.e., site 41TV447) and
assessing their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP. Impact Areas 1 and 2 were apparently
located in alluvial settings near Onion Creek, so Horizon archeologists conducted intensive
pedestrian survey activities in these 2 areas entailing surface inspection, subsurface shovel
testing, and extensive backhoe trenching. The remaining 3 of the 5 USACE jurisdictional areas
(Impact Areas 3, 4, and 5) are situated in an upland area in which Holocene alluvial deposits
were considered to be unlikely or very shallow; in these 3 areas, Horizon archeologists
conducted an intensive pedestrian survey entailing surface inspection, subsurface shovel
testing, and excavation of 1 backhoe trench.
Field survey efforts were conducted in multiple episodes from April to June 2007.
Impact Areas 1 to 5 were initially surveyed via pedestrian walkover and shovel testing from
April 30 to May 2, 2007; supplemental backhoe trenching operations were conducted in Impact
Areas 1, 2, and 3 on May 4, 7, and 8, 2007; initial site delineation backhoe trenching was
conducted on site 41TV446 in Impact Area 1 on May 18, 2007; and additional site delineation
backhoe trenching was conducted on site 41TV446 on June 12, 2007. Jeffrey D. Owens,
Principal Investigator, provided overall direction throughout the project and spent 2 days in the
field during investigations on site 41TV446. Reign Clark served as field director throughout the
project, and archeological field technicians included, at various times, Michael Mudd, Abigail
Peyton, Ron Ralph, and Jared Wiersema. The initial pedestrian survey of the 5 impact areas
consisted of traversing the APE on foot and examining the modern ground surface for historic
and prehistoric artifacts, cultural features, or other evidence of past cultural activity. At the time
of the survey, the APE consisted of a largely intact savannah environment consisting of tall
grasses, shrubs, and wildflowers dotted with isolated stands of oak and cedar trees (Figures 3
to 7). Aside from several two-track roads that traversed the property and some degree of

evident erosion in the form of rills and gullies, the APE appeared to be largely intact; however,
the density of the lush vegetative ground cover, burgeoning from recent heavy rains, rendered
visibility of the modern ground surface relatively low, thereby necessitating excavation of
subsurface probes to assess the potential of the APE to contain archeological resources.
A total of 53 subsurface probes were excavated within and in the vicinity of the APE
during the survey, including 29 shovel tests and 24 backhoe trenches (Table 3; Figures 8
and 9). For block-area survey projects, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) call for excavation of 2 subsurface probes per 1 ac for project areas
measuring from 3 to 10 ac in size. In practice, subsurface probe densities may be increased in
areas with higher probabilities to contain cultural resources, such as stream terraces, and
decreased in areas with low probabilities for cultural resources, such as heavily disturbed areas
or upland settings with minimal soil cover. Additional probes may be necessary to delineate the
boundaries of any cultural resources sites. For the current project, the TSMASS would require
a minimum of 11 subsurface probes in the combined 2.2-ha (5.4-ac) APE. Horizon considerably
exceeded the minimum survey standards and excavated a total of 53 subsurface probes during
the survey (Figures 8 and 9). Subsurface probes at Impact Areas 3, 4, and 5 were limited
largely to shovel testing due to the presence of mature, Pleistocene-age clay sediments on the
modern ground surface and the lack of potential for these components of the APE to contain
buried archeological resources at depth, though 1 backhoe trench was excavated in the vicinity
of Impact Area 3 to examine a deeper stratigraphic column and to confirm the soil structure and

lack of cultural resource potential inferred from shovel testing. Impact Areas 1 and 2, however,
were characterized by deep alluvial sediments likely deposited via overbank flooding of Onion
Creek, so numerous backhoe trenches were excavated in these 2 portions of the APE to assess
the potential for cultural resources at depths exceeding those that shovel tests are typically able
to penetrate. Additional backhoe trenches were excavated in the vicinity of Impact Area 1 to
delineate the boundaries of site 41TV446, and numerous additional shovel tests and backhoe
trenches were excavated in the vicinity of Impact Area 2 in an unsuccessful attempt to re-locate
and delineate the boundaries of site 41TV447.
Shovel tests measured 30 cm in diameter and were excavated to a target depth of 1.0 m
(3.3 ft) below surface, to the top of pre-Holocene deposits, or to the maximum depth practicable.
In practice, shovel tests were often terminated prematurely, especially in the older landforms
that characterize Impact Areas 3, 4, and 5, due to the presence of near-surface deposits of
dense clay and gravelly clay at depths of 20 to 50 cm below surface (cmbs). All sediments were
screened through 6.35-millimeter (mm) (0.25-in) hardware cloth and subsequently replaced in
the shovel test hole from which they were excavated. Due to the presence of dense, clayey
sediments of largely Pleistocene derivation in the southern two-thirds of the overall Watersedge
tract, shovel testing constituted an adequate survey technique for evaluating the cultural
resource potential of Impact Areas 3, 4, and 5. Specific shovel test data are summarized in
Appendix A.
The TSMASS require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas with the
potential to contain buried cultural materials at depths below those that shovel tests are capable
of reaching (approximately 80 to 100 cmbs or more in sandy sediments or 40 to 60 cmbs in
clayey sediments). Impact Areas 1 and 2 are situated at lower elevations on the overall
Watersedge tract on the southern terraces of Onion Creek. Deep alluvial deposits are present
in Impact Area 1, though Impact Area 2 was discovered to be transitional between the alluvial
terraces and adjacent uplands. Backhoe trenches were excavated using a 0.6-m- (2.0-ft-) wide
bucket. All trenches were approximately 0.6 m (2.0 ft) wide, 3.0 to 4.0 m (9.8 to 13.1 ft)

long, and from 1.5 to 3.5 m (4.9 to 11.5 ft) deep. The trenches were excavated by removing thin
layers measuring approximately 0.1 m (0.3 ft) in thickness from across the entire trench before
proceeding downward. Horizon personnel monitored all trench excavations. Trench walls and
floors were carefully monitored during excavation; backfill piles were thoroughly examined for
archeological resources during excavation and random samples of backfill were screened
through 6.35-mm (0.25-in) hardware cloth; and trench walls were inspected following excavation
for artifacts, distinctive stratigraphic anomalies, and/or soil discolorations that might be indicative
of past cultural activities. Horizon personnel created profile sketch maps and recorded notes on
the stratigraphic character of soil deposits observed in trench walls, though at no time did any
personnel enter into any trench deeper than 1.2 m (4.0 ft). Specific backhoe trench data are
summarized in Appendix A.
The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of all shovel tests and backhoe
were determined using hand-held Garmin ForeTrex Global Positioning System (GPS) devices
based on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken and a photographic
log was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources.
Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and
non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. No cultural materials were collected during the survey.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

The survey resulted in the re-location and reinvestigation of 1 previously recorded
archeological site (41TV446) in Impact Area 1. Site 41TV446 consists of the remains of an
aboriginal campsite that contains burned limestone rocks, burned chert cobbles, chipped stone
debris, chipped stone tools (including 1 Pedernales dart point), charcoal, faunal bone, mussel
shell, and a possible burned rock feature buried in alluvial sediments that appear to be largely
intact. A second previously recorded archeological site, 41TV447, had been mapped in the
general vicinity of Impact Area 2; however, despite extensive pedestrian surface inspection,
shovel testing, and backhoe trenching in the mapped location of this site, only 1 piece of
chipped stone lithic debris was encountered in the mapped location of the site. No cultural
materials were encountered in Impact Areas 3, 4, or 5. No historic-age structures or historic
cultural remains were encountered anywhere within the APE.

5.1

SITE 41TV446

Site 41TV446 is an aboriginal campsite situated atop the high western bank of a
prominent, albeit unnamed, tributary of Onion Creek (Figure 10). The site consists of a highdensity subsurface scatter of aboriginal cultural debris extending from as shallow as ca. 20 to
60 cmbs to as deep as 80 to 165 cmbs in different parts of the site, and there is some indication
that 2 distinct cultural components may be represented. The site is situated along the west
bank of a prominent, unnamed tributary that drains northward into Onion Creek. Subsurface
cultural materials associated with the site extend along the western bank of this deep tributary,
though the main portion of the site appears to be coincident with a broad, low rise in the
southern half of the site. Cultural deposits on this landform are generally deeper and contain
high densities of cultural materials, whereas artifact densities drop off markedly to the north,
south, and west. Site boundaries were fully delineated via backhoe trenching, demarcating a
site area that extends approximately 274 m north to south. Along its short axis, the site
measures a maximum of approximately 110 m east to west in the southern half of the site,
though the site is much narrower toward its northern extreme, measuring only about 23 m in
width north of the low rise that contains the main part of the site.
Site 41TV446 is situated almost entirely within an open tall-grass meadow containing
scattered mesquite and oak trees (Figure 11). A moderately dense forested area lines the
western bank of the unnamed tributary that forms the eastern boundary of the site. One
negative (i.e., culturally sterile) backhoe trench (BT 446-6) was excavated in the forested area,

though this area proved to be otherwise inaccessible to the backhoe and trenching operations
were, by necessity, confined to the open meadow west of the treeline. No cultural resources
were observed during an extensive surface inspection of the bed and western cutbank of the
ephemeral drainage east of the site, and it would appear that the current treeline effectively
marks the eastern site boundary. A total of 23 backhoe trenches and shovel tests were
excavated on and in the vicinity of the site, and site boundaries were defined in all directions by
at least 1 negative backhoe trench.
Seven of the trenches excavated on the site revealed sparse to dense deposits of
cultural debris (see Figure 10; Appendix A). Cultural materials observed on the site include
burned limestone rocks and chert cobbles (many of which appear to have been burned in an
extremely hot fire), lithic debris, mussel shell, faunal bone, charcoal, and a possible cultural
feature. Horizontally, the site is associated with a low topographic rise that extends westward
from the western bank of the tributary. Vertically, cultural materials were recovered from depths
ranging from as shallow as ca. 20 to 60 cmbs to as deep as 80 to 165 cmbs in different parts of
the site. BT 446-1, excavated near the treeline near the eastern edge of the low rise landform,
typifies the subsurface structure of cultural deposits. Numerous burned limestone rock
fragments, fragments of burned chert, mussel shell, and a quartzite chunk were found at depths
of 35 to 55 cmbs (Figure 12); a complete Pedernales dart point was found at a depth of 80 to
100 cmbs (Figure 13); and 2 fragments of mussel shell were found at a depth of 115 to
160 cmbs. The vertical distribution of cultural materials in BT 446-1 suggests that 2 distinct

cultural components may be represented on the site; however, the relative depths of these
components varied from trench to trench, and the buried occupation horizons were not
encountered at the same depths across the entire site. The “Upper Component,” observed in
BT 446-1 at 33 to 55 cmbs, appears to correlate with similar cultural materials encountered at
depths ranging from 0 to 60 cmbs, with the average depths falling somewhere in the range of
20 to 50 cmbs. The “Lower Component” ranges in depth from ca. 50 or 60 cmbs to 80 cmbs in
most trenches in which it was observed, though 1 trench (BT 446-7) contained cultural materials
at depths of 100 to 165 cmbs. It should be noted that BT 446-7 is located near the north end of
the site well away from the low topographic rise that contains the bulk of the cultural materials
and may represent a different occupation or prehistoric functional use area. This trench
contained a dense, isolated pocket of burned chert, burned limestone rocks, faunal bone, and
charcoal that may represent a cultural feature at a depth of ca. 100 to 165 cmbs. Figure 14
depicts representative stratigraphic profiles observed in backhoe trenches.
A total of 23 backhoe trenches and shovel tests were excavated on or in the vicinity of
site 41TV446, and 7 of the trenches yielded subsurface cultural materials (see Figure 10;
Appendix A). The site contains a multitude of artifact types, including burned limestone rocks,
burned chert and quartzite cobbles, lithic debitage, a projectile point, mussel shell, faunal bone,
and abundant charcoal in subsurface cultural deposits. Some degree of vertical separation is
apparent between the strata in which cultural materials were found, suggesting that more than
1 cultural component may be present on the site. The alluvial sediments that contain the
cultural materials appear to be largely intact, though some disturbance from animal burrows was
noted in the general area.
Site 41TV446 appears to contain stratified aboriginal components, and the presence of a
Pedernales dart point suggests that at least 1 occupation occurred during the Middle Archaic
period (ca. 2000 to 1200 B.C.). Archeological materials observed in buried contexts on the site
include burned rock, chipped stone lithic debris (including flakes and cores), burned chert
cobbles, a Pedernales point, charcoal, bone, and mussel shell. A concentrated deposit of
burned limestone rocks and chert cobbles, burned dirt, charcoal, faunal bone, and mussel shell
in BT 446-7, excavated near the north end of the site, may represent a buried cultural feature.
While the integrity of the site’s buried archeological deposits cannot be fully evaluated based on
survey-level data, the site may have potential to contribute to an understanding of the
prehistoric past under Criterion D of the NRHP; however, based on available information, the
site is currently recommended as being of unknown eligibility for the NRHP.
Based on initial development plans provided by Makar, a small, ca. 10,000-square-ft
portion of site 41TV446 situated along the southeastern site boundary would be located within
the area of proposed impacts associated with construction of the water-quality detention pond in
Impact Area 1 (Figure 15; also see Figure 10). This would encompass the portion of the site in
which BTs 446-1, 446-3, and 446-10 were excavated (see Figure 10; Appendix A). While
BT 446-10 was the last positive (i.e., culture-bearing) backhoe trench defining the southern site
boundary, this trench contained only 1 piece of lithic debitage (a burned chert core fragment) at
a depth of 0 to 40 cmbs, and it is clear that subsurface artifact densities are much lower near
the site periphery than farther north in the site center. BT 446-3 contained 1 burned chert

cobble and 1 flake at a depth of 20 to 42 cmbs. BT 446-1, described above, contained an
abundance of cultural material in what may be 2 stratified cultural components. The “Upper
Component” occurs at a depth of 35 to 55 cmbs and appears to correlate vertically with cultural
materials observed at comparable depths in other backhoe trenches. A possible “Lower
Component” occurs at a depth of 80 to 100 cmbs, or possibly up to 160 cmbs.
Based on initial development plans provided by Makar, a small, ca. 10,000-square-ft
portion of site 41TV446 situated along the southeastern site boundary would be located within
the area of proposed impacts associated with construction of the water-quality detention pond in
Impact Area 1. Based on the survey-level information available about archeological deposits on
site 41TV446 and the unknown eligibility of the site, Horizon recommended to Makar that
proposed construction plans in Impact Area 1 be redesigned in such a way that any impacts to
archeological deposits on site 41TV446 be avoided. The alternative option likely would be to
recommend archeological testing on the portion of site 41TV446 that would be impacted by
proposed construction to determine the NRHP eligibility of archeological deposits on that portion
of the site. Based on this recommendation, Makar redesigned the layout and structure of the

HJN 070011 AR

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

proposed detention pond facility in Impact Area 1 so as to avoid any impacts to site 41TV446
(Figure 16). As a result of Makar’s pond redesign, the proposed undertaking would not result in
any impacts to 41TV446; thus, no further archeological investigations are recommended in
Impact Area 1, and it is recommended that construction in this area be cleared to proceed.
Horizon recommends that Makar clearly mark the boundaries of site 41TV446 prior to the start
of construction activities to ensure that the site is not inadvertently impacted during construction.

the property that would become the current Watersedge tract. Site 41TV447 was mapped on
the eastern side of the tributary of Onion Creek in the vicinity of Impact Area 2, and is described
on the UTA site card on file at the THC as measuring approximately 200 by 100 m in size. The
site consisted of a small quantity of lithic debitage and what may have been burned rock
observed in a dirt road. The remainder of the site was covered in Bermuda grass and no
subsurface investigations were undertaken, so the estimate of the site’s size and stratigraphic
context were merely guesses. The site was described as being in “good” condition, though it
appeared to have been plowed in the past, and there appeared to be some indication that the
cultural materials were associated with a fossil terrace that may have been partially buried, at
least on its streamslope side.
Horizon revisited the mapped location of site 41TV447 and excavated 17 subsurface
probes, including 13 shovel tests and 4 backhoe trenches (Figures 17 and 18). Despite these
extensive survey efforts to re-locate and reinvestigate site 41TV447, only 1 piece of lithic
debitage was identified in the general vicinity in which this site was mapped. It is possible that
the location of site 41TV447 was incorrectly mapped during the original UTA survey or that its
location has been misplotted by site file management personnel at the THC or TARL. It is also
possible that the ephemeral cultural remains observed by UTA in 1979, which consisted only of
a few pieces of lithic debitage and possible burned rock exposed in a road cut, are no longer
extant. Backhoe trenches excavated in the vicinity revealed thick deposits of very dark brown to
black Houston Black clay overlying limestone gravel bedrock (Figure 19). The shrink-swell
clays of the Houston Black series tend to have relatively low potential to contain deeply buried
archeological deposits, and any cultural materials associated with these Blackland Prairie soils
tend to be confined to the modern ground surface. While insufficient cultural materials were
documented during the current survey to constitute an archeological site, it is likely, given the
geomorphological context and the low density and ephemeral character of cultural materials
originally observed by UTA in 1979, that any cultural remains on site 41TV447 lack sufficient
integrity to warrant further archeological investigation. Based on the original site description
recorded by UTA and the apparent lack of extant cultural remains in the present day, site
41TV447 is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and no further investigations
are recommended on this site.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:

•

Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey areas.

•

Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP.

•

Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is the determination
of whether or not an archeological site possesses the potential to make a contribution to 1 or
more previously defined research questions. Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey
level are rarely sufficient to contribute in a meaningful manner to such research issues. The
objectives are, first, to locate and delineate site boundaries within the project’s APE and,
second, to determine which archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in
pursuance of regional, methodological, or theoretical research questions. Thus, adequate
information on site function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if
appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research
questions vary as a function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context
and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the
inventory process.

6.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Ultimately, management decisions regarding cultural resource properties are a function
of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs. Cultural
resources are usually evaluated according to criteria established to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP. Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the

HJN 070011 AR

45

Chapter 6.0: Summary and Recommendations

criteria presented in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are applied following the
identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history (U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service) (36 CFR
§60.4).

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For a cultural resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

6.3

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

The survey resulted in the re-location and reinvestigation of 1 previously recorded
archeological site (41TV446) in Impact Area 1 (Table 4). Site 41TV446 consists of the remains
of an aboriginal campsite that contains burned limestone rocks, burned chert cobbles, chipped
stone debris, chipped stone tools (including 1 Pedernales dart point), charcoal, faunal bone,

mussel shell, and a possible burned rock feature buried in alluvial sediments that appear to be
largely intact. A second previously recorded archeological site, 41TV447, had been mapped in
the general vicinity of Impact Area 2; however, despite extensive pedestrian surface inspection,
shovel testing, and backhoe trenching in the mapped location of this site, only 1 piece of
chipped stone lithic debris was encountered in the mapped area of site 41TV447 (see Table 4).
No cultural materials were encountered in Impact Areas 3, 4, or 5. No historic-age structures or
historic cultural remains were encountered within the APE.
Site 41TV446
Site 41TV446 appears to contain stratified aboriginal components, and the presence of a
Pedernales dart point suggests that at least 1 occupation occurred during the Middle Archaic
period (ca. 2000 to 1200 B.C.). Archeological materials observed in buried contexts on the site
include burned rock, chipped stone lithic debris (including flakes and cores), burned chert
cobbles, charcoal, bone, and mussel shell. A concentrated deposit of burned limestone rocks
and chert cobbles, burned dirt, charcoal, faunal bone, and mussel shell in BT 446-7, excavated
near the north end of the site, may represent a buried cultural feature. While the integrity of the
site’s buried archeological deposits cannot be fully evaluated based on survey-level data, the
site may have potential to contribute to an understanding of the prehistoric past under
Criterion D of the NRHP; however, based on available information, the site is currently
recommended as being of unknown eligibility for the NRHP.
Based on initial development plans provided by Makar, a small, ca. 10,000-square-ft
portion of site 41TV446 situated along the southeastern site boundary would fall within the area
of proposed impacts associated with construction of the water-quality detention pond in Impact
Area 1. This would encompass the portion of the site in which BTs 446-1, 446-3, and 446-10
were excavated. While BT 446-10 was the last positive (i.e., culture-bearing) backhoe trench
defining the southern site boundary, this trench contained only 1 piece of lithic debitage (a
burned chert core fragment) at a depth of 0 to 40 cmbs, and it is clear that subsurface artifact
densities are much lower near the site periphery than farther north in the site center. BT 446-3
contained 1 burned chert cobble and 1 flake at a depth of 20 to 42 cmbs. BT 446-1 contained
an abundance of cultural material in what may be 2 stratified cultural components. The “Upper
Component” occurs at a depth of 35 to 55 cmbs and appears to correlate vertically with cultural

materials observed at comparable depths in other backhoe trenches. A possible “Lower
Component” occurs at a depth of 80 to 100 cmbs, or possibly up to 160 cmbs.
Site 41TV447
Horizon revisited the mapped location of a second previously recorded archeological
site, 41TV447, in the vicinity of Impact Area 2 and excavated 17 subsurface probes, including
13 shovel tests and 4 backhoe trenches. Despite these extensive survey efforts to re-locate
and reinvestigate the site, only 1 piece of lithic debitage was identified in the general vicinity in
which this site was mapped. It is possible that the location of site 41TV447 was incorrectly
mapped during the original UTA survey or that its location has been misplotted by site file
management personnel at the THC or TARL. It is also possible that the ephemeral cultural
remains observed by UTA in 1979, which consisted only of a few pieces of lithic debitage and
possible burned rock exposed in a road cut, are no longer extant. Backhoe trenches excavated
in the vicinity revealed thick deposits of very dark brown to black Houston Black clay overlying
limestone gravel bedrock. The shrink-swell clays of the Houston Black series tend to have
relatively low potential to contain deeply buried archeological deposits, and any cultural
materials associated with these Blackland Prairie soils tend to be confined to the modern
ground surface. While insufficient cultural materials were documented during the current survey
to constitute an archeological site, it is likely, given the geomorphological context and the low
density and ephemeral character of cultural materials originally observed by UTA in 1979, that
any cultural remains on site 41TV447 lack sufficient integrity to warrant further archeological
investigation. Based on the original site description recorded by UTA and the apparent lack of
extant cultural remains in the present day, site 41TV447 is recommended as ineligible for
inclusion in the NRHP, and no further investigations are recommended on this site.

6.4

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on initial development plans provided by Makar, a small, ca. 10,000-square-ft
portion of site 41TV446 situated along the southeastern site boundary would be located within
the area of proposed impacts associated with construction of the water-quality detention pond in
Impact Area 1. Based on the survey-level information available about archeological deposits on
site 41TV446 and the unknown eligibility of the site, Horizon recommended to Makar that
proposed construction plans in Impact Area 1 be redesigned in such a way that any impacts to
archeological deposits on site 41TV446 be avoided. The alternative option likely would be to
recommend archeological testing on the portion of site 41TV446 that would be impacted by
proposed construction to determine the NRHP eligibility of archeological deposits on that portion
of the site.
Based on this recommendation, Makar redesigned the layout and structure of the
proposed detention pond facility in Impact Area 1 so as to avoid any impacts to site 41TV446
(compare Figures 15 and 16). As a result of the pond redesign, the proposed undertaking
would not result in any impacts to 41TV446. Thus, no further archeological investigations are
recommended in Impact Area 1, and it is recommended that construction in this area be cleared
to proceed. Horizon recommends that Makar clearly mark the boundaries of site 41TV446 prior

48

070011_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of 5 USACE Jurisdictional Waterway Impact Areas
on the 418-Acre Watersedge Tract, Travis County, Texas

to the start of construction activities to ensure that the site is not inadvertently impacted during
construction.
One archeological site, 41TV446, was recorded in the vicinity of Impact Area 1 that is
recommended as of unknown eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP. Project-related facilities in
Impact Area 1 have been redesigned to ensure that construction would not result in any impacts
to this site. A second archeological site, 41TV447, had been previously recorded in the vicinity
of Impact Area 2; however, despite extensive survey-level efforts, this site was not re-located
during the current survey, and this site is believed to have either been misplotted on site maps
on file at the THC and TARL or to no longer exist. No cultural materials were encountered in
Impact Areas 3, 4, or 5. In accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4,
Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the
APE. As currently designed (including the redesigned facilities in Impact Area 1), no historic
properties have been identified in the APE that meet the criteria for listing on the NRHP
according to 36 CFR 60.4, no further cultural resources work is recommended in connection
with the proposed undertaking. However, in the event that any human remains or burial
furniture are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of project-related facilities, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should
cease immediately and the USACE should be notified of the discovery.
