ABSTRACT
The value of an explicit, problem oriented research design for cultural resource management
research is documented in a description of evaluative testing at a Central Texas rockshelter.
The research design incorporates regionally significant hypotheses about changes in paleoenvironment, technology, and settlement/subsistence activities. Test implications relating to the
hypotheses are used to guide field and laboratory research; data collected during the study are
considered in terms of the specific hypotheses. The site is evaluated in regard to its significance
to regional research concerns.

INTRODUCTION
The growth and development of contract archeology as a significant and
valid part of archeological research has been a slow and gradual process.
Despite its past association with emergency salvage operations, modern
contract research has the potential to be well planned, organized, and highly
effective. General fact gathering under the guise of salvage is no longer acceptable; the dichotomy between pure research and contract/salvage archeology is becoming less viable. Conservation archeology requires that any
expenditure of a resource be economical and oriented toward the solution
of substantive problems. This circumstance requires the use of a fully
developed and carefully planned research design (Goodyear et al., 1978).
Research contributions of an evaluative testing program conducted at a
Central Texas rockshelter under the sponsorship of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers is summarized. The research design of the project was developed
to permit examination of several research problems relating to interpretation
of regional prehistory. The potential of the National Register of Historic
Places as a preservation tool for significant cultural resources also is
documented.
Bear Creek Shelter (41H117) is located in the Bear Creek drainage, a
tributary of the Brazos River in Central Texas. The site was recorded by the
River Basin Surveys prior to the construction of Lake Whitney (Stephenson,
1970). It was evaluated on the basis of a 22 ft x 5 ft trench through the main
part of the shelter. Very few artifacts were recovered and the site was judged
to be a short term campsite unworthy of additional consideration.
In fairness to the River Basin Surveys, the limited time and money
available coupled with the presence of several other large, well stratified

210

rockshelters in the area probably explains the conclusions they reached
(Lynott, 1980a). Thus, the River Basin Surveys used the allocated time and
funding to investigate the site and evaluate it against a general set of
research concerns and the potential of other rockshelters in the area. These
same types of significance judgments are currently a part of conservation archeological research.
Construction of the original Lake Whitney failed to inundate the site on a
regular basis until the lake was enlarged during the middle 1970’s. The site
was monitored and the immediate erosional damage inflicted upon it by
wave action from the lake recorded. Large numbers of artifacts were exposed by the erosional process. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was
notified of the potential significance of the site.
The site was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places by the
Archaeology Research Program at Southern Methodist University. Negotiations between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, representatives of the
State Historic Preservation Officer, and the Archaeology Research Program
resulted in the initiation of a small scale testing program (Lynot~, 1976). This
testing operation revealed at least 2 m of stratified cultural deposits. The
U.S. Army Corps of engineers sponsored additional evaluative studies
(Lynott, 1978).
RESEARCH DESIGN
Bear Creek Shelter is situated on the south side of Bear Creek about a
mile east of the Brazos River. The shelter is situated in the side of a
limestone bluff about 25 m from the current channel of Bear Creek. At conservation level, water impounded by the Whitney Dam covers the floodplain
and much of the talus slope in front of the rockshelter (Fig. 1). Only a limited
portion of the cultural deposit usually is exposed. The shelter faces toward
the west, with the long axis of the shelter running roughly north-south. The
overhang covers approximately 225 sq m with an additional 300 sq m of
talus slope deposit in front of the shelter (Fig. 2).
The site is situated in the Grand Prairie biotic province. The native
uplands of this area are dominated by tall grass prairie, while the floodplains
are a mosaic of meadows among hardwood forests. The site is situated near
the edge of the prairie and the bottomland forest. The area around the site
today consists of juniper, hackberry, mesquite, and oak overstory, with a
pasture grass understory. The area has been altered by historic agricultural
activities.
The testing program provided sufficient background about the kinds of
data which might be preserved to permit the generation of a relatively
specific research design (Lynott, 1976). Major goals of the testing program
were to gather data relating to the research and management potential of
the site. Generally, this information relates to the depth, content, and
preservation of the rockshelter deposit. More specifically, the project was
designed to test four hypotheses relating to interpretive problems of Central
Brazos River prehistory.
With the current trend toward regional archeological analysis, the nature
of prehistoric occupations in rockshelters of the Central Brazos River
drainage has become a significant concern. Rockshelters are relatively com-

mon in this area of the basin and constitute an important part of the
prehistoric adaptive system.
Excavation of area rockshelters prior to 1970 focused mainly on
chronology building, which was the single most important regional concern
at that time. Since then, the development of Central Texas archeology has
generated a new set of research concerns. These concerns focus on the
functional nature of rockshelters as part of the prehistoric adaptive systems
of the Central Brazos River basin. In the last four decades, most of the large,
well stratified rockshelters in the area have been extensively excavated by
archeologists or vandals. Bear Creek Shelter offers an opportunity to examine the changing nature of a rockshelter occupation.
The hypotheses and test implications were generated from regional archeological literature and existing research concerns. They form the basis for
the research design which guided the evaluative testing program at Bear
Creek Shelter. The research design was developed prior to the initiation of
fieldwork at the site. Field and laboratory investigations were directed
toward the collection of data which reflected upon the pertinant research
concerns identified in the research design. These hypotheses by no means
exhausted all potential research concerns in the Central Brazos River Valley.
However, they are relevent to recent area studies. Although the hypotheses
are somewhat interdependent in regard to the interpretation of regional
prehistory, each hypothesis is presented and evaluated independently of the
others.
The research design focuses on four aspects of change in the natural and
cultural environments of the Central Brazos River Valley. These four areas
are climate, technology, subsistence, and site function as it relates to settlement patterns. Data collected from the Bear Creek Shelter was not sufficient
to prove or reject any of these hypotheses for the Central Brazos area.
However, these data do contribute to a better understanding of regional
problems.
The first hypothesis deals with the nature and timing of climatic changes in
the Central Brazos River Valley. From the literature (Bryan, 1969, 1977;
Shafer, 1977; Bryan and Shafer, 1977; Ritchie and Slaughter, 1972), it
was hypothesized that major ecological and climatic changes in the Central
Brazos River Valley occurred at the end of the Pleistocene/early Holocene
(10,000 B.P. - 7000 B.P.), during the Late Archaic substage (ca. 3000
-2500 B.P.), and at the end of the Early Neo-American substage (750
B.P.). Recognizing that rockshelters represent specialized and potentially
protected ecological situations, it was anticipated that regional climatic
changes would be manifested in the archeological record at the site. These
climatic changes would be reflected in fossil pollen profiles, macrobotanical
remains, depositional processes, vertebrate faunal remains, or invertebrate
remains.
The second hypothesis deals with the nature of technological change in
the Central Brazos River Valley. Traditionally, the ~change f~om use of the
atlatl to use of the bow and arrow has been viewed as a major development
associated with the beginning of the Neo-American stage. In a study of
changes in lithic tool manufacture in the Lake Whitney area, Skinner and
Gallagher (1974) observed a shift from biface reduction (associated with
dart point production) to a core and flake technology (associated with arrow

Lynott - Bear Creek Shelter

213

point production). It was hypothesized that these technological changes are
common to the entire Central Brazos River Valley and are interpretable
within the Bear Creek Shelter sequence.
In testing the hypothesis, it is necessary to assume that similar sizes of raw
material are available throughout the prehistoric period. Given this, it is anticipated that core and biface technologies will produce equal amounts of
primary debitage. Interior and possibly secondary elements will be more
numerous in biface reduction technologies, but average flake size will be
smaller. Conversely, interior and secondary elements will be fewer but
larger in core and flake technologies. Average number of dorsal flake scars is
expected to be higher and frequency of faceted platforms greater in biface
than in flake production technology. It is expected that a biface technology
will result in the discard of broken and unacceptable bifaces, while flake
technology will be reflected in a large number of exhausted and partially exhausted cores.
The study of culture change in Central Texas generally has focused upon
changes in projectile point styles. Shafer (1977) proposed a more extensive
model of technological changes in response to a regional climatic and
ecological shift. The third hypothesis considered during the study of the
Bear Creek Shelter was generated from that model.
The third hypothesis is that major changes occurred in the Central Brazos
River basin adaptive systems at about 750 B.P. Prior to this time, nomadic
hunting and gathering aimed at exploitation of bottomland resources was
the dominant subsistence strategy. After 750 B.P., local economic patterns
shifted to horticulture and bison hunting. Associated with this economic shift
was a shift from smaller seasonal camps to larger more sedentary villages. It
is hypothesized that the function of rockshelters also changed at this time.
Assuming the hypothesis is correct, it is anticipated that there will not be
major changes in the lithic assemblage, faunal and floral assemblages, or
feature types present prior to the Late Neo-American occupation of the site
(ca. 750 B.P.). During the Late Neo-American occupation, horticultural remains, bison scapula hoes, bison remains, end scrapers, four edge beveled
bifaces, blades, flake drills, and large leaf shaped bifaces will increase
significantly. Nature and number of occupational features and reflected activities will change with the shift from smaller temporary camps to larger
more sedentary habitation sites. If the settlement patterns of the Central
Brazos River Valley changed about 750 B.P., it is expected that the nature
of rockshelter occupations in this area changed in some discernable way.
The final hypothesis tested at Bear Creek Shelter also concerns the functional nature of rockshelters in the Central Brazos River basin. A list of
potential hunting and gathering activities which might pertain to prehistoric
occupants of the Central Brazos River Valley was generated. The list was
refined to include only those activities which could be recognized given anticipated preservation conditions at Bear Creek Shelter. These potentially
recognizable activities include cooking, animal food processing, plant processing, manufacture of perishable products (basketry, bone tools, etc.),
primary lithic procurement, rough lithic tool manufacture, finished lithic tool
manufacture, and disposal of the dead.
The fourth hypothesis proposes that the nature of activities at Bear Creek
Shelter changed through time. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that not all

214

Texas Archeological Society

potential activities were conducted during any single occupation.
Implementation of a test of the hypothesis required that attributes
characteristic of the hypothesized activities be identified. Cooking would be
recognized by burned and fire cracked rock, charcoal, ash, burned food remains, ceramics encrusted with burned food, and hearths. Primary lithic
procurement would be recognized by unmodified raw material, cores with
few flake scars, large numbers of primary flakes, hammerstones, and
debitage with very few dorsal flake scars.
Rough lithic tool manufacture would be identified by hammerstones,
cores, large quantities of lithic debris, high frequencies of secondary
debitage and broken, roughly shaped bifaces. Finished lithic tool manufacture would be identified by hammerstones, bone or antler flaking tools, large
quantities of interior debitage, broken preforms, small interior pressure
flakes, well developed bifaces, unused lithic tools, and a relatively high
number of dorsal flake scars on debitage.
Animal food processing would be recognized by tools with edge damage,
animal remains, cut and butchered bone, and small interior resharpening
flakes. Plant food processing would be recognized by manos, metates, nutting stones, mortars, plant food remains, and lithic tools with edge damage.
Recognition of manufacture of perishable products was entirely dependent
upon preservation conditions but would include complete and partially complete wooden tools, basketry, etc. Disposal of the dead would be identified
by intentional human burials. Since some attributes pertain to more than
one activity, activities must be identified by combinations of attributes.
Implementation of the research design was affected by contractual obligations, funding limits, and an interest in economical expenditure of the
resource. A total of 11 1 m square units were excavated in controlled 10 cm
levels. Arbitrary levels were utilized because natural stratigraphic units were
generally large and contacts between natural strata were not distinguishable
during excavation. A total of 28.1 cu m of matrix from these units was sifted
through I/4 in hardware cloth (Fig. 3). A 25% sample of each arbitrary level
from two of the units was fine screened through 1/16 in mesh. Temporal
constraints prohibited total excavation of all units; culturally sterile geological
deposits were reached only in unit 1. Figure 4 illustrates the location of test
units in relation to the shelter deposit. The following data are designed to
provide specific information relating to the hypotheses under consideration.
A complete description of field and laboratory methods was provided
elsewhere (Lynott, 1978).

FIELD AND LABORATORY DATA
The depositional environment of Bear Creek Shelter was not fully
studied, but observations of local topography and site stratification were
made. The westward facing nature of the shelter permits considerable
precipitation and some wind blown sediments to be deposited at the mouth
and talus slope. Overhang depth is sufficient to curtail great amounts of
precipitation and most wind blown sediments from reaching the rear of the
shelter. The bulk of the sediments deposited at the mouth and talus slope
appear to be a combination of slopewash from surrounding limestone bluffs,
roof fall, and wind blown sediments.

Slightly different depositional conditions existed at the rear of the shelter.
Exfoliated limestone from the roof and rear forms the basis of the natural
deposit. Since less precipitation reached the shelter rear, individual strata
show little sign of leaching and are visually more distinct than those at the
front of the shelter.
The top strata within the shelter were very light colored layers of decomposed limestone. Occasional, thin, discontinuous sheets of darker, organic
sediments were encountered within this zone. This deposit covered a dark
organic layer containing a high density of artifacts. Lighter organic
sediments wei~e under this dark layer. Differences between sedimentary
layers in the upper 3.5 m of the profile (Fig. 5) mainly are attributable to the
amount of organic material present in the deposit. In sharp contrast to these
layers, the lowest stratum in the profile is a sandy "deposit which may be a
result of alluvial deposition. The only artifacts were associated with thin,
discontinuous sheets of dark midden deposit.
In an effort to quantify the distribution of limestone roof spalls, field investigations recorded the cumulative weight of unburned limestone spalls
for each arbitrary excavation unit and level. There is a slight increase in the
amount of roof spalling with relative depth in the deposit. However, it is
greatly overshadowed by the increase of roof spalling from the mouth to the
rear of the shelter. Roof spalling data support the observation that differing
depositional environments existed at the front and rear of the shelter.
Hand and machine excavated units at the base of the talus slope revealed
considerable disturbance, presumably from wave action. The black clay
layers in this area appear to be a combination of natural and cultural
sediments, overlying a light brown sediment. The natural stratification of the
shelter is illustrated in Figure 5.
Analysis of the vertical distribution of field and laboratory data suggests
that several occupational zones are recognizable (Fig. 6). These zones correspond generally with known chronological phases in Central Texas
prehistory. Since artifacts were distributed vertically throughout the deposit,
evidence for long term shelter abandonment is lacking. Artifacts were not
concentrated in any level that could be recognized as a floor or sedentary
occupation. Relative frequencies of cultural material, changes in artifact
styles, radiocarbon dated charcoal samples, stratification of the deposit, and
sediment chemistry were used to correlate excavation levels and interpret
the cultural sequence.
The earliest occupation is attributed to the Middle Archaic substage. It was
recognized as a sheet midden overlying what appears to be alluvial sandy
clay and waterwashed limestone cobbles. This midden was recorded at
about 4.0 m below surface. It lies a meter below a feature dated at 2450
B.P. Extrapolation from stratigraphically more recent radiocarbon dates in
the sequence suggests that the Middle Archaic occupation zone spans the
period 4950 B.P. to 2950 B.P. This span roughly corresponds with phases
V and VI at Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir on the Lampasas River (Sorrow et
al., 1967) and Clear Fork and Round Rock Phases (Weir, 1976).
The next occupation of the shelter is attributed to the Late Archaic
substage. It overlies the Middle Archaic zone and varies in thickness from 40
to 60 cm. A radiocarbon date from the upper part of this zone indicates an
age of 2500 B.P. A radiocarbon date from the middle of this zone in unit 11

(4275 + 140 years B.P.) appears much too early for material recovered.
Rodent activity or possibly prehistoric human activity may be responsible for
the poor context of this date. Overall, the span of the Late Archaic occupation is estimated at 2950 B.P. to 2150 B.P. This span corresponds roughly
with phase VII at Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir (Sorrow et al., 1967) and the
San Marcos Phase (Weir, 1976).
The third occupation of the site is the Transitional Archaic substage. Two
separate occupations were recognized in units 1-5, but the distinction between these occupations could not be made in units 10-13. The lower of the
two occupations, Transitional Archaic II, varies in thickness from 50 to 70
cm. Transitional Archaic I overlies Transitional Archaic II and varies in
thickness from 30 to 50 cm. The Transitional Archaic substage comprising
the two occupations corresponds with the early part of the Twin Sister Phase
(Weir, 1976) and phase VIII at Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir (Sorrow et al.,
1967). Transitional II is believed to represent the period from about 2150
B.P. to 1750 B.P., while Transitional I is estimated at 1750 B.P. to 1450
-1350 B.P.
The next recognizable occupation of Bear Creek Shelter is attributed to
the Austin Phase. This occupation zone is the early phase of the NeoAmerican or Late Prehistoric stage and spans the period from 1450 - 1350
B.P. to about 750 B.P. This occupation zone varies from 50 to 80 cm in
thickness. Four radiocarbon dates from this zone (Table 2) are consistent
with this estimate.
The final prehistoric occupation of the rockshelter is attributed to the
Toyah Phase, which is the later phase of the Neo-American stage. This occupation zone varies from 70 to 100 cm in thickness and probably dates
from 750 B.P. until about 350 B.P. The Toyah Phase occupation is capped
by a layer of recent sterile sediment.
A total of 25 occupational features were recognized during the course of
the testing campaigns. The majority were concentrations of burned rock and
sediment. Other classes of features included a sheet midden, a human interment, mussel shell concentrations, and snail shell concentrations (Table 3).
The majority of these features were relatively small and indicated limited
use. Evidence of distinct living floors was not encountered; it seems unlikely
that any sedentary or semisedentary occupation occurred in the shelter.
Laboratory analysis of flaked lithics consisted of technological classification of lithic debris and morphological classification and microscopic examination of tools. Twenty eight cores were classified into six types based
upon number, character, and placement of striking platforms (Table 4). A
total of 6864 flakes, 2091 proximal flakes, 364 blades, and 11,720 pieces of
non diagnostic shatter were recovered. Lithic debris was examined for the
following attributes: percentage of cortex on the dorsal surface, type of striking platform preparation, number of flake scars on the dorsal surface,
length, width, thickness, and weight (Tables 5, 6). These attributes were
selected because they related directly to the hypotheses and test implications
under consideration.
Flaked lithic tools included chert and quartzite pieces that exhibited
retouch modification. These pieces were classified using a standard morphological typology (Shiner, 1974) and examined under a 30x binocular

Lynott -- Bear Creek Shelter

219

microscope for evidence of edge damage. Edge damage classes were
adopted from Greiser (1977). A quantitative summary of flaked lithic tools is
presented in Table 7. Other manufactured and modified objects recovered
from the site included ground and pecked lithic tools, modified bone and
shell ceramics, and unmodified rocks brought into the shelter by man (Table
8).
Sixteen pollen samples were collected using methods ~’ecommended by
Bryant and Holz (1968). None yielded sufficient pollen to permit a 200
grain count. Consequently, paleoenvironmental interpretations based upon
pollen analysis are limited. Indications are of a relative consistency in the
species indentified throughout the occupation of Bear Creek Shelter (Table
9).
Macrobotanical remains recovered consisted mainly of charred wood;
fine screening did recover a limited sample of seeds (Table 10). Seed remains are primarily hackberry and occur throughout the occupational sequence. Identification of larger fragments of charred woods include oak,
hackberry, cedar, elm, sycamore, mesquite, and either hickory or pecan.
There appears very little variation in composition during the occupation of
the site (Table 11). Paleoenvironmental interpretation of the macrobotanical
remains suggests an extensive hardwood-floodplain forest existing in the
vicinity of the site throughout most of its occupation. An extensive forest
probably was present in the bottomlands of lower Bear Creek and the nearby Brazos River.
Vertebrate faunal remains from Bear Creek Shelter are comprised of
birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals (Murry, 1978). The overall
composition of the faunal remains coincides with the interpretation of an
associated floodplain forest. White-tailed deer, eastern cottontail rabbit, and
turtle seem to represent the most important economic species (Tables 12,
13). Presence of several types of migratory birds indicates September
through May exploitation. Limited prairie species recovered include bison,
meadowlark, and several rodents. Significant changes in the composition of
the faunal assemblage are not notable during the occupation of the site.
Overall, the faunal evidence is indicative of a bottomland forest environment and bottomland riverine exploitative pattern throughout the occupation of the rockshelter.
Invertebrate faunal remains are comprised of snails and freshwater
shellfish. Two species of gastropod were recovered, both of which indicate
riparian environments. Mesodon roemeri (Pfeiffer) is a deep riparian
woodland snail. It was recovered from every occupation zone recognized in
the stratigraphic sequence. This snail was far less common than were the remains of Rabdotus mooreanus (Pfeiffer), which occurred in large numbers
in almost every excavation unit. Rabdotus rnooreanus (Pfeiffer) occurs on
river terrace deposits in sparsely wooded areas near water. The high frequency of this snail coincides with the dominance of non aboreal pollen
noted from the limited pollen counts.
Thirteen species of pelecypods were recovered and identified from Bear
Creek Shelter (Table 14). Proptera purpurata (Lamarck), Obvaria olivaria
(Arfinesque), and Crytibaias tamicoensis (Lea) are predominant in terms of
number and frequency of occurrence in all cultural zones. These and other
common shellfish recovered from the site prefer large river and stream

pelecypods recovered, all preferred habitats were present in the Brazos
River and lower Bear Creek throughout most of the site occupation.
Overall, the shellfish remains exhibit relative consistency from the Middle
Archaic through Toyah occupations.

rent archeological models for Central Texas in general, and Central Brazos
River Valley in particular, suggested that a major climatic change at about
750 B.P. resulted in a drastic change in adaptive strategy (Shafer, 1977;
Skinner et al., 1978). Other extant models are concerned with the
settlement-subsistence patterns of the prehistoric Brazos River basin. With
this emphasis on models dealing with paleocology and exploitation of past
environments, the research at Bear Creek Shelter was directed toward these
important concerns. Data available from Bear Creek Shelter offer the opportunity to improve significantly the understanding of prehistory in the
Central Brazos Basin by supporting or contradicting these hypotheses.
Hypothesis One
It was hypothesized that major ecological and climatic changes in the
Central Brazos River Valley occurred at the end of the Pleistocene (10,000
-8000 B.P.), during the terminal part of the Archaic period (2950 B.P.
-2450 B.P.), and at 750 B.P. The climatic change at 10,000 B.P. appears
to be widespread and associated with the final retreat of the alpine and continental glaciers of North America. The archeological record at Bear Creek
Shelter does not contain occupational or ecological data that can be attributed to this period. Consequently, this aspect of the hypothesis cannot
be tested.
Climatic change during the terminal part of the Archaic stage was proposed in a study of the geologic history of nearby Aquilla Creek (Ritchie and
Slaughter, 1972). This study indicated that a degradational period ended
and the modern aggradational period started at about this time. This time
period is thought generally to precede the beginnings of technological innovation leading to the concentrated use of the bow and arrow rather than
the atlatl. A major climatic change may have been associated with the
changes in technology.
The hypothesis of a major climatic change in Central Texas at about 750
B.P. was proposed by Shafer (1977). This climatic change was seen as a
major drying period that increased the amount of grassland habitat in Cen-

tral Texas, resulting in an increase in the number of bison (Dillehay, 1974).
This drying period was proposed as an explanation for decreased use of the
tributary valleys after 750 B.P. in the Central Brazos River drainage (Skinner et al., 1978). Presence of a major drying trend at about this time in the

Lynott - Bear Creek Shelter

227

Central Plains was documented by Bryson and Baerreis (1968).
Paleoclimatic indicators which were studied from Bear Creek Shelter include natural stratification and sediment chemistry, fossil pollen, charcoal
remains, seed remains, and vertebrate and invertebrate faunal remains.
The natural stratification and sediment chemistry of the excavated cultural
deposits in the rockshelter are believed to consist of wind blown sediments,
slopewash0 and exfoliated limestone. Deposits toward the rear of the shelter
consist of a higher proportion of exfoliated limestone, while deposits at the
front consist of a higher proportion of material brought into the shelter by
wind and/or rain. This pattern becomes established shortly after the earliest
occupation of the shelter and continues through the final prehistoric occupation. Although the basal layers of the deposit may contain some evidence of
water deposited sediments, there is little evidence of a sharp change in
depositional processes that can be attributed to climatic change.
Analysis of sediment samples for the identification of fossil pollen in Bear
Creek Shelter was disappointing. Preservation of fossil pollen was poor, but
some pollen was identified. Samples were far below the number of pollen
grains needed to make statistically valid interpretations. However, species
represented in the samples were generally consistent from sample to sample.
The identification of charcoal from the shelter suggests that a mature
floodplain forest was near the site beginning with the earliest occupation and
continuing through the last prehistoric occupation. Some minor compositional changes in this forest may have occurred. Oak and hackberry are major components of the exploited parts of the floodplain forest in every occupational zone. The only group of charred wood which changes
significantly at 3000 B.P. - 2500 B.P. and 750 B.P. is the Juglandaceae,
which includes pecan and hickory. The total sample of this group is quite
small. It is impossible to determine whether the changes noted are due to
sample size or minor changes in the environment. Considering the fairly
consistent presence of trees such as oak, hackberry, and elm, it seems
unlikely that a significant climatic or ecological change is represented.
Analysis of vertebrate faunal remains also failed to provide any significant
evidence of climatic change during the prehistoric occupation of the
rockshelter. The majority of vertebrates identified prefer a riverine or bottomland forest habitat. A few grassland species were identified, but these are
too limited in number to interpret a climatic change at any point in the sequence.
Making climatic interpretations from freshwater shellfish remains is more
difficult than interpreting other kinds of paleoenvironmental data.
Pelycopods present in the rockshelter are totally dependent upon the kinds
of shellfish habitats in the area and collecting habits of the shelter occupants.
The limited changes in relative frequencies of the pelycopods could be a
result of minor changes in area stream flows, but the majority of identified
species in each occupational zone prefer large streams or rivers. It appears
that collecting habits were oriented toward major waterways throughout the
prehistoric period, with little effort being directed toward collecting shellfish
from minor tributaries.
Quantitative data on gastropods were not collected; relative frequency of
the two identified species cannot be compared. Despite this, both species

have similar habitat preferences and occur in every occupation zone within
the shelter deposit.
The paleoenvironmental data which are available from Bear Creek
Shelter dates from roughly 5000 B.P. to about 450 B.P. Available data suggest a prolonged period of consistent climate and depositional conditions.
This situation does not preclude the possibility that climatic changes occurred elsewhere in Central Texas during this time period. Climatic interpretations are complex and a shift to wetter or dryer conditions in one area
may not necessitate a similar shift throughout Texas. Additional data are
needed from the area to determine whether the stable climatic conditions interpreted for Bear Creek Shelter are representative of the Central Brazos
drainage as a whole.
Hypothesis Two
The second hypothesis was originally proposed and tested by Skinner
and Gallagher (1974) at the Bowling Pin and Indian Springs sites at ’Lake
Whitney. The Bowling Pin site is a Neo-American campsite, while the Indian Springs site is a Late Archaic campsite. Comparison of the flaked lithic
debris, cores, and bifaces suggested that a technological shift from biface
reduction in the Archaic stage to flake production from cores in the NeoAmerican stage could be distinguished. A positive correlation between
biface technology and atlatl dart points, and core and flake technology and
arrow points may be significant in the hypothesized technological change.
Bear Creek Shelter offered the opportunity to test this hypothesis in a situation where occupational zones from the time periods in question were
situated in a stratified context. Presence of Transitional Archaic phase occupations at Bear Creek Shelter offered the opportunity to determine
whether the hypothesized change was gradual or abrupt.
Examination of data in Table 13 indicates that very little change occurred
in the technological elements during Archaic, Transitional Archaic, and

Neo-American occupations of the shelter. A high core/biface ratio is
thought to be indicative of a core technology, while a low ratio indicates a
biface technology. The limited variation (Table 15) indicates that the highest
ratio is associated with the Late Archaic zone, while the second lowest ratio
is associated with the Austin zone. This situation is the opposite of what was
predicted by the hypothesis.
Examination of relative frequencies of facetted platforms and average
number of dorsal flake scars reveals limited variation between the occupation zones in question. The only significant variation in flake weight and
length between the occupation zones is the low average size of flaking debris
in the undifferentiated Transitional Archaic zone. The anticipated increase in
size of flakes associated with core technology in the Austin and Toyah zones
is generally lacking.
Evaluation of this hypothesis assumes that the same range of flaked lithic
manufacturing activities occurred consistently at the site throughout its occupation. Examination of data relating to Hypothesis 4 provides some support for this assumption. It appears that the total manufacturing sequence
for flaked lithic tools is not present at the site. Solid evidence to support the
interpretation of a technological change from biface reduction technology to
core and flake production technology is lacking.
It is possible that the limited sample of excavated area biased the evaluation. However, the large size of the lithic sample and consistency of
technological elements through all occupations seem to be more than coincidence. It is proposed that core and biface technologies were in use
throughout the prehistoric occupation of Bear Creek Shelter.
Hypothesis Three
Shafer (1977) proposed that the most significant technological change
during the prehistoric period in Central Texas was related to the abrupt transition from the Austin to Toyah Phase. A major climatic change in Central
Texas at about 750 B.P. is thought to have resulted in a major increase in
the grassland habitat favorable to bison. During the Archaic period and the
Austin Phase, prehistoric economy in Central Texas was heavily oriented
toward exploitation of bottomland and riverine resources.
This hunting and gathering population was nomadic, living in small
bands. With the climatic shift and increase in locally available bison, the entire economy and settlement systems of Central Texas changed. Group size

increased and populations became more sedentary, occupying more
established village sites. The economy shifted away from hunting and
gathering in the river valleys and emphasized horticulture and bison
hunting. The settlement and subsistence change produced an hypothesized
change in Central Texas lithic tool technology.
Evidence of change in the vertebrate faunal remains is lacking. Floodplain
forest dwelling animals are dominant throughout the prehistoric period.
Bison remains are limited in number but are present in the Late Archaic,
Transitional, Austin, and Toyah zones. Evidence of a bison hunting
economy is lacking. Throughout Northcentral Texas, bison remains from
archeological sites are outnumbered greatly by remains of white-tailed deer.
There is some evidence for slight increase in bison exploitation in Northcentral Texas during the late prehistoric period (Lynott, 1980b). However, it is
not sufficient to postulate a bison hunting economy.
Evidence of horticultural remains or tools is lacking. Limited horticultural
remains were recovered through more extensive excavations at nearby Pictograph and Kyle sites (Stephenson, 1970; Jelks, 1962) but are not interpreted as representing an economic dependence upon horticulture. Fine
screen sampling at Bear Creek Shelter produced a small quantity of charred
hackberries, but overall exploitation of plant resources appears to have been
secondary to hunting.
Examination of lithic tools revealed little evidence of change in the kinds
of tools used between the Austin and Toyah occupations. There is a slight
increase in the relative frequency of blades, but not a real change in the frequency of end scrapers, flake drills, or leaf shaped bifaces. Four edge beveled knives are absent. Lithic tool technology seems to change very little
between the end of the Austin and beginning of the Toyah Phase. The only
significant change seems to be the style of the projectile points found in each
zone.

Based upon evidence from Bear Creek Shelter, it does not seem
reasonable to accept the hypothesized economic and settlement change for
the Lake Whitney area of the Brazos River basin. Floodplain forest and
riverine exploitation by small groups of hunters and gatherers seems to continue throughout the prehistoric period. The pattern may apply to other
areas of Central Texas.
Hypothesis Four
This hypothesis proposed that eight different activities were conducted at
Bear Creek Shelter during the prehistoric period. Not every activity was expected to occur during each occupation. It was anticipated that site function
changed through time.
Interpretations must be considered tentative because they are based upon
the assumption that the excavated sample is representative of everything
which occurred at the site. Since only a small portion of the site was excavated, this assumption is tenuous. However, by pursuing the testing of
this hypothesis, it is possible to interpret some of the activities which were
conducted at the site and provide a model of changes which may have occurred in site use during the 4500 year period.
Cooking was a significant activity during each of the temporal periods
represented at the site. Concentrations of burned and firecracked rock were
present within each of the occupation zones. Charcoal was abundant

236

Texas Archeological Society

throughout the cultural sequence and burned animal bone was recovered
from every occupational zone. Burned sediment was noted in Toyah,
Austin, and Transitional Archaic zones. Ash was noted only in the Austin
zone. Food encrusted ceramics were not recovered.
Evidence indicates that primary lithic procurement was absent or of
minimal significance during each of the occupational stages. Unmodified
chert cobbles are absent from the lithic collections in each occupational
zone. Primary elements are a small part of the total lithic debris throughout
the sequence, while cores, rough bifaces, and hammerstones are relatively
uncommon.
Rough lithic tool manufacture seems to have been a consistent part of the
prehistoric activities at Bear Creek Shelter. Hammerstones and cores are
scarce in occupation zones, but bifaces are relatively plentiful throughout the
sequence. Unused tools, or tools without edge damage, occur in every occupational zone. Secondary elements occur far less frequently than interior
elements in every occupational zone, but they always represent at least 25 %
of the debitage. This activity does not seem to have produced as much
debris as the final stages of toolmaking activities, but occurred consistently in
each occupational phase.
Lithic, antler, and bone flaking tools are rare at Bear Creek Shelter. This
situation may be due to the limited areal sample or a result of reuse and
prehistoric curation of these tools. Although these aspects of the test implications for finished lithic tool manufacture are lacking, other aspects are
present for most of the occupation zones.
Interior elements occur in high frequency in all zones, and flaked lithic
tools with edge damage occur in every zone. However, preforms are
relatively limited from undifferentiated Transitional Archaic and Late Archaic zones. The relatively high frequency of preforms in the Transitional
Archaic I and II zones indicates that sampling bias may be responsible in
part. Finished lithic tool manufacturing was important during most of the
prehistoric occupation of the site, but was relatively less important during the
Late Archaic and possibly Transitional Archaic phases.
Animal food processing was a significant activity throughout the
prehistoric occupation of the rockshelter. Bone and shell remains are common in every occupational zone. Lithic tools with edge damage which may
have been used for butchering occur in every zone. Examination of the fine
screen lithic debris sample does not exhibit fully the large number of small interior flakes. The few large flakes in every sample greatly skewed the sample.
In contrast to the importance of animal food processing, evidence for
plant food processing is minimal. Ground stone is rare at the site and grinding implements occur only in the Austin zone. The only .significant plant
food remains recovered through fine screening were hackberry seeds. Some
of these are uncharred and were probably introduced into the deposit by
natural means. Consistent absence of relevant data indicate the limited importance plant food processing played during all phases of the prehistoric
period at Bear Creek Shelter.
Objects recovered from Bear Creek Shelter that could possibly fit into
manufacture of perishable products are four modified bone and two
modified shell artifacts. Lithic tools used to make such objects probably are

Lynott - Bear Creek Shelter

237

present; but without perishables, it is not possible to recognize these activities. The manufacture of perishable products must be considered an
untested part of the prehistoric activities conducted at the site.
A human grave was uncovered at Bear Creek Shelter in the Transitional
Archaic II zone. Evidence of an intrusive pit was not noted, but it is possible
that this burial represents an interment by later residents of the site. A large
mass of limestone rubble which was situated about 20 cm above the burial
may have served as a rock cover for the grave. Interment age is estimated at
19.50 to 1450 B.P.
The major focus of activity throughout the use of the site seems to be
cooking, animal food processing, and rough and finished stages of lithic tool
manufacture (Table 16). Consistency of average flake dimensions, average
number of dorsal flake scars, and platform preparation indicate a consistency in the types of chert flaking activities throughout the occupation.
Evidence of long term occupation during the prehistoric period at Bear
Creek Shelter is lacking. The site seems to represent a series of short, intermiitent habitation, occurring consistently over a period of almost 5000
years.

CONCLUSIONS
The archeological record at Bear Creek Shelter has important implications for the interpretation of Central Brazos River prehistory. Archeological
investigations at the site were designed to test four hypotheses relating to
changes in climate, technology, and settlement-subsistence patterns in the
Central Brazos region. Of central interest to the study was the role of
rockshelter occupations within the regional adaptive system.
Rockshelters are relatively common in the Central Brazos River drainage,
particularly in the Lake Whitney area. Research at a variety of sites (Jelks,
1953, 1962; Long, 1961; Stephenson, 1970; Watt, 1978) produced a
reasonably well established chronology for the Central Brazos Valley.
However, knowledge about the position of rockshelter occupations within
the regional settlement and subsistence system is limited. Investigations at
Bear Creek Shelter were directed toward this topic.
To insure that specific data relating to regional research concerns were
collected, archeological investigations at Bear Creek Shelter were aimed at
testing four hypotheses. About 2% of the site was excavated and evaluation
of the four hypotheses suffers from a small sample. Interpretations are offered on the basis of the limited excavated sample being representative of
site data.
The first hypothesis proposed that climatic changes in the Central Brazos
River basin occurred during two periods. Data from Bear Creek Shelter included gastropods, pelycopods, vertebrate faunal remains, macrobotanical
remains, fossil pollen, and sediment chemistry. Data showed considerable
stability throughout the occupation of the rockshelter. If climatic changes did
occur, they were minor and not recognizable in the archeological record.
The second hypothesis proposed a major change in flaked lithic tool production technology at the end of the Archaic period. Prehistoric occupants
of the area shifted from a biface reduction to a core and flake production

technology. Both forms of lithic tool manufacture were utilized throughout
occupation of the shelter.
The third hypothesis proposed major technological changes occurring in
the Central Brazos River basin adaptive patterns at about 750 B.P. Relevant
data did not provide evidence of technological or subsistence changes. Exploitation of a diffuse group of bottomland fauna represents the dominant
economic pattern from the Middle Archaic phase until the end of the
prehistoric period. Evidence of a shift to any significant kind of horticultural
economy is lacking and evidence of plant food processing is limited.
The final hypothesis proposed a variety of prehistoric activities
recognizable from material remains. Data indicated that cooking, animal
food processing, and rough and finished lithic tool manufacture were
primary activities conducted at the site during every occupation. Plant food
processing and disposal of the dead were occasional activities. There is little
evidence for the primary procurement of lithic raw material. The nature of
occupations at the site appear to indicate a series of short term usages over a
considerable period of time. Evidence of a prolonged single occupation or a
prolonged abandonment is lacking.
On the basis of these interpretations, the site is considered a hunting
camp. It is uncertain whether the shelter was used for only one season of the
annual round or was inhabited regularly throughout the year. Activities and
site function inferred at Bear Creek Shelter may not be representative of
other shelters in the Central Brazos basin. Restudy of existing collections are
needed.
Grinding slabs and manos are present at Kyle (Jelks, 1962:55) and Pictograph shelters (Stephenson, 1970:140-141) suggesting that plant food
processing was an important activity at these sites. Features at these sites are
more substantial in size and frequency than those at Bear Creek Shelter.
Presence of slab lined cists or hearths at those sites may mean that the oc-

Lynott - Bear Creek Shelter

239

cupations there were more regular or prolonged than inferred for Bear
Creek Shelter.
Due to the size limitations of rockshelters in this area, it is unlikely that any
shelter served as a permanent base camp for a population of any size. Some
rockshelters probably were used as temporary hunting camps while others in
more favorable locations served as seasonal camps for several family
groups. The westward facing position of Bear Creek Shelter may have
made it a less desirable winter camp than more sheltered localities.
The hypothesis testing format utilized in testing and evaluating Bear
Creek Shelter demonstrated that data relating to a series of problems which
are important to the interpretation of regional prehistory are preserved at the
site. Recognizing the significance of Bear Creek Shelter, the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers chose a mitigative procedure designed to stabilize and
preserve the site. The Corps plans to stabilize the site deposit with a liquid
concrete solution (Galm, 1978). When the solution dries, it should seal the
cultural deposits and prevent further erosion from wave action of the lake.
Not only does this decision preserve an extremely significant cultural
resource, it offers the opportunity to monitor the affect of partial inundation
on archeological remains over a prolonged period. Similar examples of in
place preservation of significant archeological remains are relatively rare.
A well defined program of significance evaluation which incorporates the
testin~g of regionally important hypotheses with the gathering of management data provides an effective means of demonstrating and evaluating
significance (Raab and Klinger, 1977). The archeological resource base in
the United States is diminishing too rapidly to permit salvage excavations to
be conducted without a fully developed research design. Contract archeologists have an obligation to the profession and public to make their
work contribute to the interpretation of significant research problems. The
future of American archeology is dependent upon the profession’s ability to
make serious research contributions from contract projects and incorporate
research concerns with in place preservation of significant cultural resources.
