ABSTRACT

The City of Midlothian intends to construct Water Treatment Plant 2 on
approximately 80 acres approximately a mile north of US 67 and about
4,500 feet of associated pipeline route with an APE of 50 feet that runs
adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad track. During the later part of May
and the first part of June of 2008, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed plant area and
the pipeline route for Schrickel, Rollins and Associates, Inc., which is
doing the environmental planning for the City. The survey was done under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4913 since the City of Midlothian is a
political entity of the State of Texas. The plant site and pipeline route are
situated in the Blackland Prairie just south of the end of the White Rock
Escarpment where numerous historic and prehistoric archaeological sites
have been reported. No cultural materials older than 50 years were found
on the ground surface or uncovered in 30 shovel tests during the
archaeological survey. Apparently, the drainages in the survey area did not
have diverse food resources or the protection provided by Hollings Branch
and other drainages that originated in the White Rock Escarpment.
Furthermore the lack of the escarpment face and the presence of rolling
prairie were not desirable settings for homesteads although historic
residences are mapped along nearby roads on early twentieth century
maps.
Based upon the results of the survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends
that further cultural investigations are unwarranted and that the City of
Midlothian be allowed to construct Water Treatment Plant Number 2 and
the associated pipeline route. Furthermore, we recommend that if buried
cultural materials are encountered during construction, work should cease
immediately in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Midlothian’s intends to construct Water Treatment Plant No. 2 on
approximately 80 acres and about 4,500 feet of associated pipeline route with an APE of
50 feet. The proposed pipeline route begins north of US 67 and runs northwest parallel
and adjacent to an existing Union Pacific railroad track. The proposed pipeline route
crosses beneath the track and enters the water treatment plant approximately 1.5 miles
northwest of center of Midlothian. The plant site is west of and adjacent to the railroad
track (Figure 1). During the early part of May and the early part of June of 2008, AR
Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the water
treatment plant site and pipeline route for Schrickel, Rollins and Associates, Inc., which
is doing the environmental planning for the City.
The archaeological survey was done to determine if cultural resources were present, and,
if so, make recommendations about their significance as well as determine how they
would be impacted by construction. Since the City of Midlothian is a political entity of
the State of Texas, an antiquities permit was required for the archaeological survey. The
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission issued Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4913 for the archaeological survey. According to Mr. Bryant Caswell of
Schrickel, Rollins and Associates, Inc., the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of
Engineers states that the study area may fall within their jurisdiction; therefore, relevant
federal legislation includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended
(PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the
Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), and
Executive Order 11590 “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment.”
Therefore, the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission will not only act
as the State Review Agency but also as the Section 106 Review Agency.
The following report contains a brief description of the natural environment of the area.
This is followed by a summary of the cultural history previous archaeological
investigations in the surrounding area. The research design and methodology are the next
chapter. The results section presents the information collected by the field survey. A
section with recommendations follows. The last section is a list of the references cited.
This report is prepared following the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (ND) and utilized by the Texas Historical Commission.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Ellis County’s terrain ranges from level to rolling Blackland Prairie. The county is
drained by the Trinity River which has various tributaries such as Red Oak, Waxahachie,
Mill and Chamber creeks. Trees such as elm, hackberry, oak, pecan and cottonwood are
present along drainages but are scarce away from the drainages. Prairie grasses include
Indian, buffalo, grama, big and little bluestem and three-awn (Haaser 2007:1).
The bedrock underlying the study area is Eagle Ford Shale (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1988). The soils in the study area belong to the Ellis-Houston-Houston Black
Soil Association which consists of nearly level to rolling upland Blackland clays (Brooks
et al. 1964:General Soils Map). Mapped soils within the study area consist of eroded Ellis
and Houston clays with 3 to 5 and 5 to 12 percent slopes and Houston and Ellis clays
with 1 to 3 percent slopes (Brooks et al. 1964:Sheet 7).
The study area lies at the southwestern end of the White Rock Escarpment and contains a
portion of the Mountain Creek watershed. The Hollings Branch watershed is just
northeast of the study area. The Mountain Creek Watershed presents a unique setting in
North Central Texas where the exposed western edge of the White Rock Formation forms
the steep rocky scarp east of the creek channel with the rolling Grand Prairie and Eastern
Cross Timbers to the west (Kennemer 1987:1). The White Rock Escarpment, as it is
known, has been deeply incised by the upper end of Mountain Creek and by Artesian
Creek and other intermittent creeks on the east side of the valley. Of these, Mountain
Creek, Baggett Branch, John Penn Branch, and Artesian Creek are apparently spring-fed
and would have provided a reliable year-round water source.
Historically, the Escarpment was covered with cedars, junipers actually, while the top of
the Escarpment to the east was Blackland Prairie and the rolling prairie to the west was
backed by the Eastern Cross Timbers. Mountain Creek was a major floodplain forest
(Martin 1988). So within a distance of five km of the Ubil site, a wide variety of plants
and aquatic resources were present and they could have provided an equally wide variety
of terrestrial, avian, and aquatic plant and animal food sources.

ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE MOUNTAIN CREEK WATERSHED
Cultural historical investigations in the Mountain Creek Basin upstream from the junction
of the West Fork of the Trinity river began more than fifty years ago with the survey and
recording of numerous prehistoric archaeological sites by members of the Dallas
Archeological Society (DAS) such as R. K. Harris (1936). More recent work was done in
conjunction with construction of the Joe Pool Lake which was originally termed
Lakeview Lake. The work was done under the direction of the Archaeology Research
Program at Southern Methodist University (SMU), except for some Historic
Architectural Buildings Survey (HABS) work at the Penn site that was done by
Environment Consultants (1984) and completed by AR Consultants. This work is briefly
summarized below, but the reader is referred to the original reports for additional
information.

The initial lake site survey was done in 1977-78 and resulted in the locating and
recording of 17 prehistoric archaeological sites and 25 historic archaeological/ standing
structure sites (Skinner and Connors 1979). Many of these sites had previously been
recorded by DAS members who surveyed the Mountain Creek area in the 1940s. Based
on the survey findings, it was hypothesized that prehistoric settlement in the area was of a
seasonal nature and was limited by water availability. Moreover, based on the apparent
abundance of chert lithics, rather than quartzite lithics more commonly found at sites
along the main stem of the Trinity River, it was concluded that the residents were from
the Brazos River Basin rather than from the closer Trinity River area.
In 1979 and 1980, SMU and a team from North Texas State University (now the
University of North Texas) tested for buried sites at Joe Pool Lake. They also tested the
already recorded sites in order to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places, as well as to assess the impact that construction would have
on the various sites, and to offer a series of resource management recommendations
(Raab 1982:1).
Prehistoric testing focused on the Cobb-Pool site which appeared to contain a possible
pithouse and associated features and refuse deposits dating to the period A.D. 800-1200.
Work at the site suggested that Cobb-Pool was part of a settlement pattern based on
exploitation of a range of resources provided by greater effective moisture than in the
project area today.
Mitigation activities at the Joe Pool Lake were carried out by SMU between 1984-1986
and are reported in two monographs (Peter and McGregor editors 1988; Jurney, Lebo and
Green 1988). Excavation was done at six prehistoric sites including the Late Prehistoric
period Cobb-Pool and Baggett Branch sites, and three sites with primarily Late Archaic
occupations. Cobb-Pool was shown to represent a horticultural community occupied in
the first half of the 13th century. Baggett Branch had a late occupation characterized by
the presence of bison, Plains-style artifacts, and shell-tempered pottery similar to the type
Nocona Plain. The authors concluded that the Late Archaic and Early Late Prehistoric
occupation of the area was on a seasonal basis, primarily during the summer (Peter and
McGregor 1988:363-364). The Cobb-Pool site is the only evidence of Middle Late
Prehistoric occupation and may indicate year-round occupation. The Late Late
Prehistoric period occupation was probably seasonal.
During the 1980s, SMU personnel and the DAS conducted studies in the area. Survey of
a sanitary sewer route along Baggett Branch was done for the Lake Ridge Development
Company (Peter and McGregor 1987). One previously recorded prehistoric site
(41DL135) was relocated and a separate prehistoric artifact locality was noted. Both
deposits were shallow and small. It was recommended that the route avoid site 41DL135
as it was considered to be an example of a short-term foraging camp. The DAS and SMU
personnel had previously tested two other sites (41DL137 and 41EL33) located along the
upland drainages of the White Rock Escarpment (Peter and McGregor 1988:367; Hartig
1988). The Lester Lorch site (41DL137) is situated adjacent to a known spring where an

unnamed tributary issues forth from the White Rock Escarpment. Artifacts from the site
included Middle and Late Archaic dart points, snub-nosed end scrapers, bone tools and
beads, at least one incised sherd, drilled mussel shells, and arrow points. Many of the
chipped stone tools, particularly the dart points and snub-nosed end scrapers, are made on
fine grain quartzite which characterizes the Late Archaic assemblages from Joe Pool
Lake and the Trinity River. The Hollings Branch site (41EL33) is situated approximately
five meters above the creek channel on a level bench and covers an area estimated to be
85 m by 25-30 m. The deposit is confined to the upper 20-30 cm below the present
ground surface. The site is different from Lester Lorch in that only a few arrow points
were recovered along with a few pieces of mussel shell, fire-cracked rock, and lithic
debris. Hundreds of pieces of animal bone are the most common artifact class. Peter
(1998) suspected that these sites may have been occupied during the summer when the
tree cover would have provided protection from the direct sun.
More recently, AR Consultants conducted several surveys in the Mountain Creek basin.
The Pleasant Valley Golf Course survey (Skinner, Lindsay, and Young 1992) located no
prehistoric sites. The second investigation was the survey of 560 acres included at the site
of the Veterans Administration National Cemetery of North Texas located east of
Mountain Creek Lake at the base of the White Rock Escarpment (Skinner, Whorton, and
Dillon 1995). No prehistoric sites were located. Survey of the Grand Prairie Business
Park at the junction of Mountain Creek and the West Fork of the Trinity did not locate
any sites on the surface or in the levee along the West Fork (Kent, Skinner and Trask
1998). Survey of the Cedar Mountain Preserve for the City of Cedar Hill located no
prehistoric sites in the valley or on the slopes and top of the Escarpment Kent and
Skinner 1998a). Survey of the proposed Sunset Ranch development (Skinner 1998)
located four prehistoric site deposits (41EL233-235) on the benches above Hollings
Creek downstream from the Hollings Branch site. Broken large mammal bones were the
most common artifacts found in the midden deposits which ranged from 15 to 30 m in
diameter. Additional artifacts included chert lithic debris and fire-cracked rock. None of
these sites were dated but the presence of charcoal and animal bone should allow for
dating and environmental reconstruction. Recently, a buried ash lens was discovered in
the bank of Baggett Branch a meter below the present ground surface and several
hundred meters downstream from the Baggett Branch site. No artifacts were recovered
but an ash/charcoal sample and a fractured large mammal long bone were radiocarbon
dated (Skinner and Todd 2007). The ash dated 320±40 BP (Beta 225641) and the bone
dated 390±40 BP (Beta 225640).

Using the above temporal framework, the following paragraphs present a brief
description of the culture history of the area.
The Paleo-Indian period is distinguished by projectile point styles attributed to this
period. Many of the points are made of cherts that are not native to North Central Texas.
The Lewisville site and the Aubrey Clovis site in Denton County are the only excavated
Paleo-Indian sites in the region (Crook and Harris 1957; Ferring 2001), and both are on
the Elm Fork to the north. Surface artifacts generally come from deposits on stream
terraces above the level of the active floodplain. This is a period when large mammals
became extinct, and their extinction is attributed in part to a general environmental
drying.
During the Early Archaic, the general drying continued, and sites are found on stream
terraces. There is a hint of population increase, and Lynott (1981:103) suggests that there
was increased emphasis on the use of bottomland food resources. Middle Archaic sites
are predominantly found on the first terrace above stream floodplains. As earlier, sites
tend to be along the Elm Fork rather than along the smaller tributaries. The population
density continued to be low. Late Archaic sites increase in number over the previous
period, and sites are located both along the Elm Fork and its tributaries. There appears to
be a strong shift in site location to tributary streams, and a pronounced population
explosion. Within the Elm Fork basin, local Ogallala quartzite was being used
prominently at this time, and this observation is taken by some authors (Skinner 1981;
Prewitt 1983) as evidence of increased territorial constriction. On Mountain Creek, it
appears that the earliest occupation was during the Late Archaic, and that occupation was
only on a seasonal, not year-round basis. Moreover, unlike the Elm Fork and most of
Dallas County, lithics are predominantly cherts which may have been secured to the
southwest near Alvarado (McGregor 1995).
During the Late Prehistoric period, the bow and arrow and pottery appear in artifact
assemblages (Shafer 1977). Houses and evidence of agriculture first appear during this
period, as shown at the Cobb-Pool site. Early Late Prehistoric site locations mirror those
of the Late Archaic, and chert continued as the common material for chipped stone
projectiles and tools within the Mountain Creek basin. The West Fork Paleosol is
tentatively dated to this period, although it has been dated earlier that A.D. 800 in some
places (Ferring 1990). Drying continued into the subsequent period. Buffalo bones are
common in Late Late Prehistoric sites (Dillehay 1974; Lynott 1979; Peter and McGregor
1988a:241), along with tools normally expected to occur at sites on the High Plains.
Protohistoric Native American occupation in the Dallas County is reported by numerous
regional history authors. Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American
occupation has been found in the area (Peter, Cliff, and Green 1996:2). This pattern of
finding virtually no physical evidence of historic Native American in the form of artifacts

[beads, gun-flints, cooking utensils, etc.] is seen throughout much of North Central Texas
(Skinner 1988), and has been related to the abandonment of the region in the 1500/1600s
caused by a major regional drought.
Euro-American Contact Period (A.D. 1600-1820)
Historic Native American sites attributed to this period are virtually unknown in the area
although historic sites are described as being present. During this period, first the Spanish
and then the French traded to the Tonkawa who were the first historic Native-American
inhabitants of the area. However, several nations such as the Wacos, Bidais, Anadarkos
and Kickappos visited the area (Haaser 2007:1).
American Era (1820-present)
This era has been divided into four periods by Richner and Lee (1977:48-50). The four
periods are frontier (ca 1820-1840), initial cash crop (ca 1840-1870), tenant farming (ca
1870-1940), and agribusiness (ca 1940-present). By the end of the frontier period, Native
American populations had disappeared from the region. The second period was divided
by the Civil War, but was characterized by the growth of cotton as a cash crop and the
use of the river for transportation. Tenant farming replaced the plantation system after the
Civil War and railroads replaced river navigation as the means of moving cotton to the
market place. Lumbering and oil production were added to the economic base during this
period. The last period (Agribusiness) is marked by the consolidation of farms and the
use of mechanized equipment to plant and harvest crops that had been done in the past by
the once large labor pool. Since the beginning of this period, crop production has been
replaced with livestock production and cotton has been replaced by pasturage.
Previous Archaeological Investigations
The major archaeological surveys done in Ellis County were implemented during the
surveys for Lake Bardwell (Shafer 1964; Sorrow 1966) and the Superconducting Super
Collider by Southern Methodist University and Mercyhurst College (Yedlowski et al.
1998). Sixteen prehistoric sites ranging in age from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric
were found during the initial investigation of Lake Bardwell (Shafer 1964). Site types
consisted of lithic scatters, temporary camp sites and camp sites. The survey was
followed by the testing of the Pecan Springs site (41EL11) to determine if it was suitable
for nomination to the NRHP (Sorrow 1966). The site contained seven hearths, three
burials and two pits. Artifact types included dart and arrow points, ground and pecked
stone, lithic debris, knives, other lithic tool types, pottery, animal bone and freshwater
mussel shells, some of which had been worked.
Various other surveys such as for pipeline, parks, etc. have recorded archaeological sites.
Some of the surveys are discussed below and are from publications listed below or else
the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2008). In 1981, Cole (1981) investigated 77 acres in
Ellis, Johnson and Navarro counties for flood water retarding structures for the Chambers
Creek watershed but failed to discover any archaeological sites.

Anthony and Brown (1990) surveyed approximately 20 miles of pipeline route and
discovered four historic 20th century farmsteads. The farmsteads were considered
ineligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as State
Archeological Landmarks (SAL).
In 1995, Jurney surveyed approximately 47 acres within the Ennis Community Park but
failed to find any archaeological sites. Geo-Marine, Inc. (Hunt and Peter 1996)
investigated approximately 240 acres adjacent to Lake Bardwell. Two historic farmsteads
were recorded. Site 41EL 221 was considered a likely candidate for nomination to the
NRHP.
Approximately 253 acres were surveyed for the Ellis County Landfill (Turpin 1997). Five
20th century homesteads and associated outbuildings were recorded. Approximately 840
acres were investigated for the railroad bypass and only one historic 19th or 20th century
homestead (41EL240) was recorded (Campbell et al. 2000). PBS&J (King and Cliff
2003) investigated a transmission line that covered approximately 83 linear acres. Only
one prehistoric site was located in 471 shovel tests.
A cultural resources survey was conducted of a hike and bike trail that was approximately
four miles long on the banks of Waxahachie Creek for the City of Waxahachie (Skinner
and Kent 1998b). A historic homestead out of the survey area was recorded. AR
Consultants investigated approximately 5 miles of pipeline and a water treatment plant
near Alma for the Rice Water Supply Corporation (Skinner and Trask 2000). During the
survey, three historic farmsteads were recorded. In 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd
2007) conducted an archaeological survey within the Red Oak Creek Wastewater
Treatment Plant. No cultural materials were discovered on the ground surface or
uncovered in five shovel tests.
AR Consultants (Skinner 1998) conducted an archaeological survey of approximately
600 acres for a golf course approximately 2.1 miles northeast of the study area. The golf
course study area includes the headwaters of Holings Branch. Five prehistoric sites
(41EL33, 41El232-235) were recorded and consist of seasonal family camps located
where water was available during dry seasons. Five historic sites (41EL227-231) also
were recorded. Two were historic homesteads built in the late 1800s and two were built
in the early 1900s. The fifth site consists of a rectangular rock outline of unknown
function.
Six archaeological sites were listed for the Britton, Texas 7.5’ USGS map in which the
study area is located (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas 2008). All were either 19th or 20th
historic farmsteads. No sites are recorded adjacent to or within the study area. Also, no
residences are shown on the 1901 Ells County Map (Ellis County, 1901), 1910 Soil Map
for Ellis County (Bureau of Soils 1910) or the 1936 Road Map for Ellis County (Texas
State Highway Department 1936).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The Research Design was formulated so that the information derived from the
archaeological survey benefited not only Ellis County but the State of Texas as well.
Research Design
The first hypothesis was that prehistoric sites would not be present due to the lack of
perennial water and low biotic diversity. Secondly, it was felt that historic residences
might be present adjacent to US 67, but absent in other areas due to the preference for
using the land for farming. In order to test these hypotheses, an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey was conducted which is described in the Methodology portion of
this chapter.
Methodology
The proposed plant site was investigated by the archaeologists walking east-west oriented
transects spaced 30 m apart. For 80 acres, the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002) has
recommended that at least 40 shovel tests be excavated. This was not followed, however,
due to the fact that only about 14 acres were undisturbed and ground visibility was
greater than 30 percent in the disturbed portion of the plant site. The proposed pipeline
route was visually surveyed while walking the route but not shovel tested due good
ground visibility and disturbance from trash piles deposited along the route.
Shovel tests were excavated to approximately 35 cm below the ground surface in the
upland setting. The clay matrices were not screened but were broken by hand and
visually inspected for cultural materials as were the pit walls. Notes on the topography,
vegetation, soils and other relevant information were made and photographs were taken.
Deep testing was not done since no well-developed floodplain was present to bury and
preserve cultural deposits.

RESULTS
This portion of the report is broken into three parts. The intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of the plant site is described first followed by a discussion of the
proposed pipeline route. Conclusions derived from the survey end the chapter. Shovel
tests are described generally in the text and their locations are shown on Figure 6.
Specific shovel test information is provided in Table 1.
The plant site
The plant site is enclosed by fence on three sides and a railroad track on the fourth side
which made its limits easy to determine. The land slopes gently southwest and three
vegetative areas are present. The eastern one-third consists of a corn field (Figure 2)
where ground visibility is at least 40 percent and ranges up to 80 percent in places. Eyeheight visibility is very good. The western one-third is a wheat field (Figure 3) and the

ground and eye-height visibility is similar to that of the eastern one-third. Limestone
gravel and cobbles were present in the fields but were most abundant in the eastern
portion of the plant site just west of the railroad track.
The central portion consists of unimproved pasture/field (Figures 4 and 5). Trees include
eastern red cedar, mesquite and hackberry. Understory vegetation includes buttercup,
Indian paint brush, basketflower, johnson grass and other grass species. Based upon the
presence of the mesquite and eastern red cedar, the ground probably was farmed in the
past. Ground visibility was less than 20 percent and the shovel tests were concentrated in
this area. Eye-height was good in grassy areas but almost zero in front of the scattered
trees.
Besides plowing, other disturbance to the area consists of a pipeline in the southwest
corner of the tract (Figure 5) and the eastern edge of the tract appears to have had soil
removed to construct the railroad berm.
Survey began in the northwest corner and went east. Thirty shovel tests were excavated
within the proposed plant site and encountered culturally sterile clay at depths ranging
from the surface to 37 cm bs. No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the
ground surface during the survey.
The pipeline route
Survey of the proposed pipeline route began east of the plant site and went south to US
67 and will be placed in undulating terrain. The pipeline route will be constructed in
unimproved pasture (Figure 7) for approximately one-half mile at which point a small
drainage is encountered. The drainage is approximately a meter wide and deep and has a
clay substrate that contains limestone gravel and cobbles. A concrete sanitary sewer
manhole was just north of the drainage. Surprisingly, ground visibility ranged from less
than 10 to 100 percent along this portion of the route. Generally, the ground visibility
exceeded 30 percent.
From south of the drainage to US 67, the pipeline route will be placed in heavily forested
areas alternating with plowed pasture. Several piles of limestone debris (Figure 8) have
been dumped where the forested areas are.
As previously stated, the pipeline route was walked and visually evaluated for the
presence of cultural materials older than 50 years. None were seen on the ground surface
and no signature plants, cultural features or house foundations were noted either. No
locations likely to contain archaeological sites were discovered.

Conclusions
As expected, no prehistoric sites were discovered despite the relative presence of sites
just to the north along Hollings Branch and other Mountain Creek tributaries. The lack of
prehistoric sites in the study area is attributed to the unprotected setting in the prairie
where water was intermittent at best and the native vegetation was not harvestable by
hunters and gatherers. Furthermore, large mammals (bison and antelope) rarely were
present and deer would not have been found in the prairie setting. Knappable lithic
materials also were not present so there were few reasons for camping in the area.
The absence of historic sites is attributed to the use of the land for farming and the
accessibility to the area from nearby roads where residences are shown on early twentieth
century maps.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the absence of archaeological sites, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that
the City of Midlothian be allowed to construct Water Treatment Plant Number 2 and the
associated pipeline. We further recommend that if buried cultural materials are uncovered
during construction, work immediately should stop in that area and the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
