Cultural Resources Survey on Texas State Land for the Orla Gas Gathering System – Culberson Lateral Project in
Reeves County, Texas

ABSTRACT
On behalf of Enterprise Texas Pipeline LLC (Enterprise), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of Texas State land for the proposed Orla Gas Gathering
System – Culberson Lateral Project, 1.6 km (1 mile) of natural gas buried pipeline in west Texas. The proposed
pipeline begins in Culberson County and terminates at the proposed gas plant site in Reeves County.
Approximately 1.6 km (1 mile) of the pipeline crosses lands managed by Texas General Land Office (TX
GLO) in Reeves County. This report discusses the undertaking on the TX GLO land portion, which requires
project review by the Texas Historical Commission under the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Antiquities
Permit Application #7745).
The proposed area of potential effects for the project is the construction workspace, which includes
Enterprise’s proposed right-of-way (ROW). The proposed pipeline corridor on state land in Texas consists of
a 15.24-m (50-foot) permanent ROW, plus an additional 15.24 m (50 feet) of temporary workspace. The
cultural resources investigation surveyed a total corridor width of 45.7 m (150 feet) to allow for flexibility in
the location of the temporary workspace. The survey area totals 17.73 acres on TX GLO.
SWCA performed a cultural resources file records review on July 14, 2016, to determine whether the project
area had been previously surveyed for cultural resources and whether any archaeological sites have been
recorded in or near the project area. To conduct this review, SWCA project manager Amanda Cohen searched
the THC Texas Archeological Sites Atlas database and site files at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. One previously recorded site, 41RV15, was identified approximately 125.25 m (411 feet) north
of the project area.
From August 15 to 17, 2016, SWCA archaeologists Kevin Pintz and Courtney Blair conducted an
archaeological survey of the staked centerline for the survey on Texas State land. Enterprise proposes to
construct approximately 40 km (25 miles) of pipeline, two central delivery points, and a cryogenic gas
processing plant, one mile of which falls on Texas GLO lands. Eleven isolated finds (IFs) and three prehistoric
archaeological sites were documented within the project area in Texas. The IFs consist of prehistoric flaked
stone debitage, lithic tools, and lithic manufacturing items. The prehistoric sites are artifact scatters with no
associated features. The sites identified during the survey are recommended not eligible for the National
Register of Historic Places within the surveyed corridor, and the portion outside the proposed corridor was
not recorded or assessed for NRHP eligibility.
Survey and site recordings were performed in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (13 Texas Administrative Code 26.20), THC policy, and the Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (36 Code of Federal Regulations 800). A 100 percent (intensive) cultural
resources pedestrian inventory was conducted by SWCA archaeologists by walking parallel transects spaced
no more than 15 m (49 feet) apart. Conditions for the survey were fair. The survey area had been heavily
disturbed by road and transmission infrastructure construction associated with oil and gas activities to the
north of the centerline, while south of the centerline had little to no disturbance by roads and construction
disturbance. Vegetation was low to high in density, and ground visibility ranged from 40 to 80 percent.
In total, 29 shovel tests were excavated in support of the project. Prior to conducting fieldwork, Natural
Resources Conservation Service (2016) soil surveys within the project area and geologic maps were consulted
in order to assess the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits. THC archaeological standards specify that
a minimum of 16 shovel tests are required per mile within a survey corridor of 30.5 m (100 feet) unless surface
visibility is greater than 30 percent. Areas with the potential for buried deposits were identified and
subsequently assessed in the field. The SWCA survey placed an additional 18 shovel tests across the three
newly identified sites.

in Reeves County, Texas
SWCA Project Number. 38761
Project Description. SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an archaeological
background review and intensive pedestrian survey for the Enterprise Texas Pipeline LLC (Enterprise) Orla
Gas Gathering System Project on state land in Reeves County, Texas, to determine whether the undertaking
would impact any significant archaeological resources.
Location. The project area is located on state land in Reeves County, Texas. The westernmost point of the
project is located approximately 8.26 km (5.13 miles) west-southwest of Orla and the easternmost point is
approximately 6.65 km (4.13 miles) west-southwest of Orla. The project is on the Orla, Texas 7.5-minute
U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle.
Number of Acres Surveyed. 17.73 acres in Texas
Principal Investigator. Cherie Walth
Date of Work. August 15–17, 2016
Purpose of Work. Enterprise is seeking authorization to construct and operate the Orla Gas Gathering
System, 40 km (25 miles) of natural gas buried pipeline, two central delivery point areas, and a future
cryogenic gas plant, in southeast New Mexico and west Texas. The proposed pipeline begins in Culberson
County and terminates at the proposed gas plant site in Reeves County. Approximately 1.6 km (1 mile) of
the pipeline crosses Texas State land in Reeves County. This report discusses the undertaking on the Texas
State land portion, which requires project review by the Texas Historical Commission under the Antiquities
Code of Texas (Texas Antiquities Permit Application #7745).
Enterprise is proposing to build the Orla Gas Gathering System to safely and efficiently transport natural
gas from a central delivery point in southeast New Mexico and west Texas to a future cryogenic gas
processing plant in Texas and eventually to market.
The proposed APE for the project is the construction workspace, which includes Enterprise’s proposed
right-of-way (ROW). The proposed pipeline corridor on TX GLO land consists of a 15.24-m (50-foot)
permanent ROW, plus an additional 15.24-m (50-foot) of temporary workspace. The cultural resources
investigation surveyed a total corridor width of 45.7 m (150 feet) to allow for flexibility in the location of
the temporary workspace. The survey area totals 17.73 acres in Texas.
Properties Identified. Eleven isolated finds (IFs) and three prehistoric archaeological sites were
documented within the survey project area. The IFs consist of prehistoric flaked stone debitage, lithic tools,
and lithic manufacturing items. The prehistoric sites are artifact scatter with no associated features.
Eligibility of Properties. The three sites identified during the additional survey are recommended not
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) within the proposed corridor.
Curation. No artifacts were collected. All documents associated with the project are curated at the Texas
Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

Comments. This report focuses on the section of the proposed pipeline survey area within lands managed
by TX GLO in Reeves County, Texas. The three identified sites are recommended not eligible for the NRHP
and no further management for these sites is recommended. The 11 IFs, by definition, are not eligible for
the NRHP. SWCA recommends that the proposed project will have No Adverse Effect on historic
properties and that it be allowed to proceed as planned. Site summaries, eligibility, and mitigation
recommendations are provided below in Table 4.1.

1 INTRODUCTION
Enterprise Texas Pipeline LLC (Enterprise) is seeking authorization to construct and operate the Orla Gas
Gathering System – Culberson Lateral, 40 km (25 miles) of natural gas buried pipeline, two central delivery
points, and a future cryogenic plant, in southeast New Mexico and west Texas. Enterprise is proposing to
build the Orla Gas Gathering System to safely and efficiently transport natural gas from central delivery
points to a future cryogenic processing plant in Texas and eventually to market. Enterprise’s objectives for
the proposed project is to provide growth opportunities for producers in the Permian Basin by providing an
additional outlet for natural gas. The pipeline would cross over 1.6 km (1 mile) of Texas State lands in
Reeves County. This report discusses the undertaking on the Texas State land portion managed by the Texas
General Land Office (TX GLO).
The equipment required for construction of the pipeline and aboveground facilities would include trenchers,
trackhoes, sidebooms, and other tractors. In addition, personal trucks, welding trucks, cranes, and flatbed
trailers would be required. The majority of heavy equipment that would be necessary would remain in the
construction right-of-way (ROW), minimizing activity on public roads. Enterprise is requesting a 22.86-mwide (100-foot-wide) construction ROW during the installation of the proposed pipeline. The ROW would
consist of 15.24 m (50 feet) of temporary ROW to be used only during construction and 15.24 m (50 feet)
of permanent ROW.
Enterprise selected SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) to conduct an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of the area of potential effects (APE) to aid in complying with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act. The survey for the Texas portion of the project is located in northwest
Reeves County, Texas. The westernmost point of the project is located approximately 8.26 km (5.13 miles)
west-southwest of Orla and the easternmost point is approximately 6.65 km (4.13 miles) west-southwest of
Orla. It is located on the Orla (31103-G8), Texas 7.5-minute U.S. Geological Survey quadrangle (Figure
1.1 and Figure 1.2, see Appendix A).
This report details the results of a Class III intensive archaeological survey by SWCA for the segment of
the proposed Orla Gas Gathering System – Culberson Lateral Project survey located on state land in Texas.
This report discusses the undertaking on the Texas State land portion, which requires project review by the
Texas Historical Commission under the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Antiquities Permit Application
#7745). SWCA conducted the cultural resources survey from August 15 to 17, 2016. Three newly recorded
sites and 11 isolated finds (IFs) were documented in Texas. Locations of the cultural resources are included
in Appendix A.
SWCA’s Cherie Walth acted as Principal Investigator for the investigation and Amanda Cohen acted as
Project Manager. Fieldwork investigations were conducted by Kevin Pintz and Courtney Blair.

2 NATURAL AND CULTURAL SETTING
The project area lies within the northeastern portion of the Chihuahuan Desert in the Permian Basin in
mesquite shrub dune habitat approximately 6.65 km (4.13 miles) west-southwest of the town of Orla, 1.82
km (1.13 miles) south of Farm Road 652, and 8 km (4.97 miles) west of U.S. Highway 285. The project
area and surrounding region have been impacted by oil drilling and pipeline activities, and the survey
corridor is within the greater Permian Basin Oil Field.

2.1

Natural Setting

The project area lies within an area of parabolic/coppice dunes in the Permian Basin region of west Texas.
The project area is combination of Chihuahuan Desertscrub and Semidesert Grasslands (Brown 1994). The
Chihuahuan Desertscrub biotic community is a succulent-shrub dominated high desert that transitions into
semidesert grasslands to the east. Playas, once pluvial lakes, and now intermittently flooded wetlands
devoid of vegetation, are located within this biome. Dominant shrub species include creosote bush,
whitethorn acacia, and allthorn, with some invading mesquite, woody shrubs, and cacti. Yuccas are
increasingly present in the upslopes of this biome and agaves grow in the project area west of the Pecos
River (Brown 1994:169–175).
Chihuahuan Desertscrub transitions into Semidesert Grasslands, which are warm-temperate grasslands
characterized by seasonal droughts, drying winds, and moderate winter temperatures (Brown 1994:122).
Modifications to this landscape from extended grazing activities include the replacement of the native grass
cover with woody plants, shrubs, cacti, and forbs. In the project area, this biome is represented by mixed
bunch grasses with taller scrub species like mesquite. Common species include grama and muhly grasses,
bluestem grass, several species of threeawn, mallows, devil’s claw, yuccas, cacti, catclaw acacia, and
javelina bush. Tarbush, whitethorn acacia, creosote bush, and mesquite are Chihuahuan Desertscrub species
invading semidesert grassland biotic communities (Brown 1994:123–131). Mesquite, yuccas, and agaves
were important prehistoric resources. Many of the other typical grasses and plants were also collected for
subsistence and to provide material for non-subsistence use.
Soils in the project area are mostly expressed on the surface by sandy loams, silty loams, dense gravels, and
exposed gypsum bedrock in the form of undulating slopes to relatively flat, grassy areas. High percentages
of calcuium carbonate nodules are common in areas containing these soils. Soils in the project area are
identified by three soil types (Table 2.1).

The most common animals found in the region are mule deer, prairie dog, ground squirrel, gopher, fox,
kangaroo rat, desert shrew, coyote, black-tailed jackrabbit, and desert cottontail. Also typical to the area are
scaled quail, burrowing owl, and Chihuahuan raven (Brown 1994), as well as mourning doves, wrens, and
hawks. Representative snakes in the area include bullsnake, prairie rattlesnake, plains hognose snake, and
western hooknose snake. Numerous lizards are also in the project area (Biota Information System of New
Mexico 2016; Brown 1994).

Annual temperature extremes are (or can be) significant, with summer temperatures regularly exceeding
100 degrees Fahrenheit and winter temperatures dropping well below freezing. The majority of
precipitation occurs during the summer months and is associated with thunderstorms. Precipitation ranges
from around 20.3 to 30.5 cm (8–12 inches) a year. The combination of rainfall and temperature makes for
marked seasonality and a long growing season (Western Regional Climate Center [WRCC] 2016).
The Pecos River is 10.85 km (6.74 miles) northeast of the eastern extent of the project area. Rustler Hills
is 23.09 km (14.35 miles) to the southwest, and Owl Hills is approximately 26.89 km (16.71 miles)
northwest of the survey corridor. Nearby drainages include Salt Creek, which is 1.27 km (0.79 mile) west
of the western extent of the project area and undulates in a north and south direction. Screw Bean Draw is
3.36 km (2.09 miles) west of the project area. Numerous small intermittent playas are 10.14 km (6.30 miles)
to the east of the survey corridor.
Vegetation in the project area is low to high in occurrence. Dominant species include mesquite shrub,
acacia, and creosote bush. It is generally thought that there has been little change in the vegetation and
climate of the area since middle Holocene times (8000 B.P.); thus, current environmental conditions provide
a context for interpreting the prehistoric occupation of the area. Animals that would have been commonly
found in the area prior to development of the oil fields include jackrabbit and cottontail rabbit, deer,
pronghorn, various rats and mice, coyote, snakes, turtles, quail, and badger. Many of these species were
also of economic importance to the prehistoric peoples of the area.

2.2

Cultural Setting

The project area is located in Reeves County, Texas, extending approximately 21.23 km (13.19 mile) south
of the Texas-New Mexico border. The following archaeological background describes prehistoric lifeways
in southeast New Mexico and west Texas. Humans have inhabited southeast New Mexico and west Texas
for at least the last 13,000 years. This occupation reflects a sequence of cultural development stretching
from hunting and gathering, through the development of agriculture, to historic and modern life. The culture
history of the region is commonly divided into four broad periods—Paleoindian, Archaic, Formative, and
historic—each of which is typified by different cultural adaptations. As part of the effort to revise the
Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Carlsbad Field Office (CFO) Resource Management Plan, Jim Railey
from SWCA authored a Class I analysis of all known archaeological resources in the CFO region (Railey
2013) and west Texas. The following discussion is adapted from Railey (2013) based on the proximity of
the project area to southeast New Mexico and supported by the similarity of the cultural resource findings.
Because only prehistoric sites were encountered in the field, a discussion of historic settlement in Texas is
excluded from this discussion.

Paleoindian Tradition (11,500–7000 B.C.)
The earliest, well-established presence of humans in the region dates from Paleoindian tradition (ca.
11,500–7000 B.C.), which is customarily divided into three periods: Clovis (11,500–10,800 B.C.), Folsom
(10,800–9800 B.C.), and Late Paleoindian, or Plano (9800–7000 B.C.). Paleoindian sites and components
in the Jornada Mogollon region are recognized almost exclusively by diagnostic artifacts associated with
each of these periods (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:213), and chronometrically dated at camp or kill sites,
including ones in eastern New Mexico and west Texas (e.g., Haynes 1992; Holliday 1997; Johnson and
Holliday 1981). There are few identified Paleoindian components in the region, although their components
suggest concentrations along the Pecos River, the Mescalero Escarpment Base, and in far southeastern Lea
County, New Mexico, near what were probably pluvial lakes (Condon and Smith 2012).

Reeves County, Texas

The Paleoindian tradition is best known from assemblages of flaked stone artifacts, and the emphasis on
formal, retouched tools during this time reflects a reliable and maintainable tool kit that kept highly mobile
hunter-foragers prepared for a variety of circumstances and encounter situations (Bleed 1986; Kelly and
Todd 1988; Jennings et al. 2010). Ground stone tools were rarely, if ever, used during Paleoindian times,
and this (along with the absence of baking pits and hot-rock cooking) reflects an emphasis on meat in the
diet, and a lack of exploitation of seeds and other low-ranking food resources that required extending
processing prior to consumption (see Bettinger 2001).
Three Paleoindian complexes have been identified in the region, based on morphologically distinct
projectile point styles. The Clovis period corresponds to the Younger Dryas, a climatic interval toward the
end of the Pleistocene that was cool and dry (Cordell 1997:89; Haynes 2008; Holliday and Meltzer 2010;
Polyak et al. 2004). Clovis people hunted mammoths and other Pleistocene megafauna, along with smaller
animals (Cannon and Meltzer 2008; Cordell and McBrinn 2012:110). Tool assemblages include not only
the distinctive Clovis fluted point, but also large flake blades, biface and blade cores, knives, scrapers, core
choppers, and burins (see Collins 2007).
During the Folsom period (10,800–9800 B.C.), the climate in the eastern Southwest and Southern Plains
became both warmer and wetter (Cordell and McBrinn 2012:115; Polyak et al. 2004). The mobile hunterforager lifeway continued. Mammoths were extinct by this time, and the focus of big-game hunting shifted
to Bison antiquus, a larger ancestor of the present-day bison (MacDonald 1981; Meltzer 2009; Surovell
2009). Smaller animals were also hunted by Folsom and later Paleoindian groups as well (Amick 1996;
Bamforth 2002; Cannon and Meltzer 2004). Tool kits were somewhat more diverse than those of the Clovis
period and include the diagnostic Folsom fluted points and their unfluted counterparts (called Midland
points), along with knives, gravers, spokeshaves, pointed scrapers, cores (bifacial, discoidal, and informal),
drills, burins, choppers, abrading stones, awls, and needles (Frison and Bradley 1980; Huckell and Judge
2006; Meltzer 2006).
The warming trend during Folsom times continued during the subsequent Late Paleoindian or Plano period
(9800–7000 B.C.), but precipitation trends reverse as drier conditions once again set in (Mallouf 1981;
Monger and Buck 1995; Van Devender 1990). The fluted points of the Clovis and Folsom periods were
replaced by various unfluted lanceolate styles, classified within various complexes such as Plainview,
Firstview, and Cody (Cordell and McBrinn 2012:106–107). Otherwise, tool assemblages were, overall,
similar to those of the previous periods. People continued to rely on hunting and foraging for their
subsistence (Cannon and Meltzer 2004). Bison continued to be the main big-game prey, although Bison
antiquus was extinct by this time, with smaller bison similar to the present-day species having taken their
place (MacDonald 1981).

Archaic Tradition (7000 B.C.–A.D. 500)
The Archaic tradition covers a vast swath of time between the end of the Paleoindian tradition and the
appearance of ceramics around A.D. 500. Archaic cultural history, classification, and chronology in the
region rely to a large extent on frameworks developed in neighboring regions (e.g., Irwin-Williams 1973,
1979; Johnson and Holliday 2004:290–292; MacNeish 1993; MacNeish and Beckett 1987; Mallouf 1985,
2005; Sayles 1983; Sayles and Antevs 1941; see also Huckell 1996:319–323; Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:218). Three Archaic periods are widely recognized in the region: Early Archaic (6000–3200 B.C.),
Middle Archaic (3200–1800 B.C.), and Late Archaic (1800 B.C.–A.D. 500). However, these periods and
their bracketing dates do not correspond very closely to some important changes in climate, subsistence
economics, and other developments over the course of the Archaic tradition. Also, depending on which
chronology is used there is a hiatus lasting anywhere from 500 to 1,000 years between the dates bracketing
the end of the Paleoindian and beginning of the Archaic tradition. There is debate as to the significance of
this apparent hiatus; Irwin-Williams (1979:35) argued that the hiatus reflects migration of Paleoindian

hunters out of the desert Southwest to the north, with desert-adapted hunter-gatherers from the Great Basin
filling in behind them. As with the Paleoindian tradition, identification of Archaic periods at sites in the
region relies primarily on diagnostic projectile points, although the advent of pit baking led to the creation
and enhancement chronometrically datable archaeological contexts. The result is that we have many
radiocarbon dates for the Archaic tradition, and the identification of components does not rely as much on
projectile points as it does for those dating from Paleoindian times.
The most diagnostic artifacts on Archaic sites are atlatl dart points. These points can vary greatly in shape
and usually appear less well made than Paleoindian points. If the different morphological types reflect
different ethnic or kinship groups, the great variety of point forms from Archaic sites in west Texas and
southeastern New Mexico may indicate that several different Archaic groups used the area (Phippen et al.
2000:468–470; Sebastian and Larralde 1989:42). Another possibility is that the different point types reflect
reworking and repair of broken points (Flenniken and Wilke 1989). After Paleoindian times there was a
transition from lanceolate to mostly stemmed projectile points, including the Jay and Bajada types of IrwinWilliams’ (1973, 1979) Oshara tradition, and Uvalde and other types identified in central and west Texas
(Prewitt 1981; Turpin 1994:70; Weir 1976; see also Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:220). Scrapers, knives, and
chopping tools are common, although Irwin-Williams (1973, 1979) reports that ground stone was lacking
in the Jay phase (5500–4800 B.C.) and does not mention its occurrence in the subsequent Bajada phase
(4800–3200 B.C.). Ground stone milling tools are reported from Early Archaic contexts in the western
Jornada Mogollon region (MacNeish 1993). Irwin-Williams (1973:6–7) notes the appearance of cooking
pits with burned rock in the Bajada phase, and in west Texas and the western Jornada area hot-rock cooking
and a broad-spectrum subsistence pattern were established during the Early Archaic period (Dering 1999;
Mallouf 1985; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:220–221; Turpin 1994:70).
The Early Archaic period falls mostly or entirely within the Altithermal, an exceptionally dry interval that
apparently led to a drastic reduction of available surface water (Antevs 1948, 1953, 1955; Haynes 1975;
Hester 1972; Holliday 1989; Johnson and Holliday 1986, 2004:290–291; Meltzer 1991). Whether this
involved an increase in average temperatures or reduced precipitation remains somewhat of an open
question, but in all likelihood both factors were at play (Meltzer and Collins 1987). These conditions
prevailed for a long interval beginning around 6000 B.C. and lasted until sometime between 3000 and 2000
B.C. (i.e., into the Middle Archaic period). East of the Pecos River many springs, marshes, and playa lakes
probably dried up during the Altithermal, leaving available water sources localized and dispersed. This may
have led to intensified competition, starvation, and out-migration on an appreciable scale. At least some of
those who stayed on the Llano Estacado and around its margins resorted to digging water wells at springs
and playas that had dried up, but where water could still be found just below the surface.
During the Middle Archaic period projectile point styles diversify somewhat, both within and between
regions, although in general points have either contracted stems with flat, rounded, or pointed bases or
expanded stems with concave bases (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:225). A broad-spectrum subsistence
economy was well established by Middle Archaic times, including the use of low-ranking seeds and roots
that require extensive processing prior to consumption. This is evidenced not only by biotic remains, but
also by the common occurrence of ground stone milling tools, cooking pits, and burned rock in Middle
Archaic contexts (Huckell 1996:336–342; Mallouf 1985; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:224–225). The earliest
maize in the Southwest dates from the near the end of the Middle Archaic time frame (Mabry 2005),
although no maize or other cultigens are known for this period in or near the region.
The arid climate of the Altithermal continued into at least the early portion of the Middle Archaic period
(Antevs 1948, 1953, 1955; Haynes 1975; Hester 1972; Johnson and Holliday 1986, 2004:290–291; Meltzer
1991), but conditions improved beginning sometime during the interval 3000–2000 B.C., when the climate
became wetter or cooler across the region (Berry and Berry 1986:312–314; Cordell and McBrinn 2012:125;
Hogan 1983, 1994; Johnson and Holliday 2004:291; Mehringer 1967; Mehringer et al. 1966; Oldfield and

Schoenwetter 1975; Petersen 1981; Smith 2002; Smith and McFaul 1997; Wendlund and Bryson 1974).
This led to a proliferation and resurgence of reliable sources of surface water and a widespread expansion
and enrichment of the available biomass (Johnson and Holliday 2004:291). The improved climatic
conditions are probably largely responsible for a dramatic increase and ubiquity of archaeological sites and
radiocarbon dates, and a much more extensive and ubiquitous distribution of sites across the landscape that
begins in the Middle Archaic period (Berry and Berry 1986; Carmichael 1986; Mallouf 1985, 2005:219;
Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:223; Railey et al. 2011; Walth and Railey 2011:352–366). Sites become
common in many upland areas, and desert basin floors and plains away from river corridors, which had
been largely unoccupied during the mid-Holocene. At present, the data suggest some increase in population
levels from the Early to Middle Archaic periods, but the evidence is weak and population levels apparently
remained low throughout Middle Archaic times.
The Late Archaic period (1800 B.C.–A.D. 500) witnessed a continuation and intensification of trends set
in motion following the end of Pleistocene, and in many respects marks a major turning point in the
prehistory of the Southwest and Southern Plains. Diagnostic projectile points are mostly expanded stem
forms with varying blade shapes that may or may not have strong shoulders (e.g., Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:Figure 7-11), although other styles are found as well, including bifurcated base and straight-stem
forms (Mallouf 2005:226). Maize-based farming becomes widespread throughout the Southwest as an
addition to the broad-spectrum hunting-gathering subsistence economy (Cordell and McBrinn 2012:136–
149; Huckell 1996:343–349). There was pre-ceramic maize in portions of the Jornada Mogollon region
(e.g., Campbell and Railey 2008; Tagg 1996; Upham et al. 1987; Wills and Huckell 1994:42), but thus far
there is no clear evidence of Late Archaic farming in this portion of west Texas. A proliferation of pit
houses, bell-shaped pits, and sites with middens and abundant artifacts, suggests reduced mobility under
increasing population densities (Huckell 1996:343–349), but again these trends are not evident at present
in the region. In fact, at present there are no discernible structure remains or storage pits known for the Late
Archaic period in the region, rich midden deposits are rare or absent, and the vast majority of features
consist of hearths, roasting pits, and burned-rock middens, the latter mostly west of the Pecos River. In
other words, the archaeological evidence strongly suggests a continuation of highly mobile, hunter-gatherer
lifeways across at least most of the local region during Late Archaic times.
Despite the continuation of a highly mobile, hunter-gatherer lifeway, there were some important changes
and developments in the Late Archaic period of the region. The favorable climatic trend that began during
Middle Archaic times continued into the Late Archaic period, with the cooler and wetter conditions
resulting in an increased biomass and proliferation of new water sources across the landscape (cf., Berry
and Berry 1986:312–314; Cordell and McBrinn 2012:125; Hogan 1983, 1994; Johnson and Holliday
2004:291; Mehringer 1967; Mehringer et al. 1966; Oldfield and Schoenwetter 1975; Petersen 1981; Polyak
and Asmerom 2001; Smith 2002; Smith and McFaul 1997; Wendlund and Bryson 1974). The vast plains
east of the Pecos River were probably too dry for intensive and efficient foraging during the Early Archaic
and most of the Middle Archaic period, but by Late Archaic times hunter-gatherers in the region were
beginning to fully realize the potential of the landscape’s enriched resource abundance. The widespread
occurrence of freshwater mussel shell at many sites across the landscape suggests the possibility that aquatic
habitats occurred along many now-dry drainages in the region, most of which were probably also dry during
the Altithermal. Among other things the favorable climate and enhanced biomass that continued into Late
Archaic times included an enrichment of grassland habitats, which apparently resulted in increased numbers
of bison and a new round of bison hunting over a broad region.
Archaeological evidence suggests the improved climatic conditions of Late Archaic times had two
important effects within the region: 1) a sharp population increase, and 2) new foraging opportunities for
hunter-gatherers that allowed for more ubiquitous use of the landscape through residential mobility. The
dramatic increase in Late Archaic components and radiocarbon dates indicates intensified and more
ubiquitous exploitation of the landscape. This is part of a broad pattern across the Southwest and Southern

Plains, in which people expanded into all ecological zones, including once-marginal ones such as uplands
and intermountain desert basins (Berry and Berry 1986; Carmichael 1986; Mallouf 1985, 2005:219; Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004:226; Railey et al. 2011; Walth and Railey 2011:352–366). Similarly, in the region not
only do site components, dates, and diagnostic artifacts increase sharply at this time, but they are also
distributed widely across the landscape. In terms of hunter-gatherer mobility and subsistence, these patterns
are probably the result of the improved climatic conditions, population growth, and changes in mobility.
The more common availability of surface water, and increased resource abundance across the landscape,
meant that hunter-gatherers could now forage more efficiently, moving their camps more frequently around
the landscape. This strategy would have decreased the distance and time involved in daily foraging trips,
translating into a greater return of caloric intake per unit of energy expended (cf. Kelly 1995:111–148).
Archaeologically this would all result in higher numbers, and a more ubiquitous distribution of, preserved
camp remains (such as artifact scatters and cooking pits), relative to previous time periods. This is precisely
what we see for the Late Archaic period in the region.

Formative Tradition (A.D. 500–1450)
“Formative” is a term commonly applied by archaeologists to the ceramic periods of the Jornada Mogollon
region (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:236–237). The well-dated sequence of sites in the Hondo Valley,
northwest of the region, suggests that ceramics appeared there around A.D. 500 (Campbell and Railey
2008), and this date is used here for the beginning of the Formative tradition. The addition of ceramics to
the inventory of artifacts provides a tremendous advantage in recognizing Formative period site components
as compared to pre-ceramic ones. Ceramics also enhance temporal resolution and age estimates of site
components, especially for the more distinctive, painted wares that can cross-date between different
regions. For this discussion, the Formative tradition is simply divided into two periods: Early (ca. A.D.
500–1100) and Late Formative (ca. A.D. 1100–1450), with the appearance of Chupadero Black-on-white
being the most prominent marker separating the two. Phase divisions within these periods can certainly be
suggested based in part on the appearance of certain key marker traits, such as early black-on-white
ceramics toward the end of the Early Formative, and a variety of distinctive glaze ware and polychromes
after ca. A.D. 1300. But the development of well-established phase sequences will depend on excavation
data from more sites with securely dated, single-component contexts. The early centuries of the Formative
time frame witnessed little change in subsistence and mobility from the Late Archaic. But significant
changes did occur in the Late Formative period, although for the general region some of the more important
Late Formative developments are inferred from surrounding regions, and further research will hopefully
clarify the specifics of these in the project region.
Two prominent changes in artifact assemblages mark the beginning of the Early Formative period. One is
the appearance of ceramics, which in the beginning consist of undecorated brown wares. These are
variously classified according to paste characteristics as Jornada Brown, McKenzie Brown, Middle Pecos
Micaceous Brown, South Pecos Brown, and Alma Plain (Hill 1996, 2000, 2001; Hogan 2006; Jelinek 1967;
Katz and Katz 1985, 1993, 2001; Kelley 1984; Leslie 1979; Mera 1943; Reed et al. 2002:550–551; Runyan
and Hedrick 1987; Whalen 1981; Wilson 2000a, 2000b, 2003; Wiseman 1996, 2002), and which persist
well into Late Formative time frame. Early black-on-white ceramics (e.g., Cebolleta, Red Mesa, Mimbres)
appear in the region after ca. A.D. 750 (Katz and Katz 1993), but do not occur at all sites in the later
centuries of the Early Formative, and undecorated brown wares continue to dominate ceramic assemblages
throughout the period.
The introduction of the bow and arrow is inferred from a sharp reduction in the size of projectile points,
which occurs across most of sub-boreal North American around A.D. 500–600 (Bettinger and Eerkens
1999; Bettinger and Taylor 1974; Blitz 1988:130–132; Cordell 1979:134, 1997; Guernsey 1931:71–72, 99,

Shott 1993; Torres 2000:227; VanPool 2006:433; Yerkes and Pecora 1991). In the Southwest and Southern

Plains, the earliest arrow points are strongly shouldered, corner-notched or stemmed forms. At the welldated series of sites in the Hondo Valley of the Sierra Blanca highlands (Campbell and Railey 2008; Railey
2010), the earliest arrow points have shouldered, recurved blades similar to the Bonham and Homan types
in northeast Texas (Turner and Hester 1993:202, 219), and these are quickly followed by straight-bladed
points with tanged shoulders and corner notching. The latter forms, similar to the Scallorn type of the Plains
(Turner and Hester 1993:230) and the Trujillo and Dolores types in northern New Mexico (Justice 2002;
Turnbow 1997:202–205), persist throughout the remainder of the Early Formative period and continue into
the early portion of the Late Formative.
Except for the addition of ceramics and arrow points, Early Formative artifact assemblages remain similar
to those of the Late Archaic, with a variety of flaked stone tools and ground stone milling implements.
Other aspects of the Early Formative archaeological record also persist from Late Archaic times. There is
still a notable dearth of preserved house remains; the few dating from the Early Formative period in the
region come from just four sites (Jones et al. 2010; Railey 2011; Zamora 2000), and their characteristics
suggest rather expedient, wickiup-like brush huts set in shallow basins. The lack of evidence for
substantially constructed houses prior to the Late Formative suggests people across at least most of the
region did not invest heavily in residential architecture, and this is typical of highly mobile hunter-gatherers
(Binford 1990; Kelly 1995:139–140).
Botanical remains of various wild plants, including cheno-ams, wild barley, and others are common
occurrences (e.g., Acklen and Railey 2001; Brown 2011; Condon et al. 2008; Lord and Reynolds 1985;
Railey 2011), along with succulents processed in burned-rock middens in the western portion of the region
(Jones et al. 2010). Unlike the Late Archaic, in the region there is one instance of charred maize associated
with a radiocarbon date for the Early Formative, at a site in the Guadalupe Mountains (Kemrer 1998).
Otherwise, at present there is a complete lack of domesticates in macrobotanical assemblages in securely
dated, pre-Late Formative contexts, and this indicates that farming was not an important part of the
subsistence economy (or was not practiced at all) across most of the region during Early Formative times.
The onset of the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (A.D. 800/900–1350) reportedly ushered in a dry period that
heavily impacted people across much of western North America (Jones et al. 1999). The data suggest that
people responded to this drastic climatic change by withdrawing to areas where reliable sources of surface
water could still be found, which includes the Pecos River and, apparently, playas, areas below escarpment
edges (most notably along the base of the Mescalero Escarpment, where freshwater springs probably
continued to issue forth), and in the Mountain Slope area. In the latter area, most of the dates are from
burned-rock middens, so the numbers may also indicate an upswing in the use of these sites and exploitation
of low-rank, high-cost food resources processed at them (see Dering 1999). Although precipitation levels
apparently increased again toward the end of the Early Formative, the damage apparently was already done,
and the response to the period of severe drought may have helped prompt some fundamental changes in
cultural adaptations that took hold during the subsequent Late Formative period.
The Late Formative period indeed witnessed some of the most profound changes in the prehistory of the
region. In terms of artifacts, the most prominent temporal indices of this period are a variety of distinct and
relatively well-dated decorated ceramic types. Chupadero Black-on-white and El Paso painted (bichrome
and early polychromes, and later just El Paso polychrome) are present by the beginning of this period, or
soon after, eventually edge out undecorated brown wares, and persist as common types throughout the Late
Formative time frame (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:252–253; Speth and Newlander 2012; Wilson 2000b).
Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta is another distinctive type that appears in the region around the beginning
of the Late Formative period, but is less common than the Chupadero and El Paso painted wares (Runyan
and Hedrick 1987). Chupadero wares were manufactured in the Sierra Blanca highlands (Clark 2006; Creel
et al. 2002; Reed et al. 2002). Also from this region is Corona Corrugated, a utilitarian ware that appears
around or soon after A.D. 1200 (Kelley 1984; Wiseman 2002). St. Johns Polychrome appears at about this

same time (Miller 1995; Runyan and Hedrick 1987). After A.D. 1300, exotic ceramic types from a variety
of areas in the Southwest appear in west Texas and southeastern New Mexico, including Rio Grande glaze
wares, Lincoln Black-on-red from the Sierra Blanca highlands in New Mexico, Ramos Polychrome from
the Casas Grandes area, and Gila Polychrome from the Salado region (Katz and Katz 1993; Miller 1995).
Another post-A.D. 1300 ceramic type is Ochoa Indented, a Southern Plains type that appears to be restricted
to areas east of the Pecos River (Katz and Katz 1993).
Also occurring in the Late Formative period is a widely documented shift in arrow point morphology during
the thirteenth century. The earlier, corner-notched arrow point styles with strong shoulders are replaced by
side-notched arrow points with wide, squared, or concave bases. These late forms are usually referred to as
Harrell, Desert Side-notched, Washita, or Pueblo Side-notched (Justice 2002; Speth 2004; Turnbow 1997;
Turner and Hester 1993). Unnotched triangular points are rare in the Southwest, but do occur in the Plains
(and are especially common in eastern North America) and spill over in small numbers into the project
vicinity. In Texas these are usually referred to as Fresno points, and their reported time span (ca. A.D. 800–
1700) is not as restricted as those for the other arrow point types discussed above. There is evidence to
suggest that these unnotched triangular points are actually preforms that were intended to be finished and
notched, and they were widely transported as they were less fragile and susceptible to breakage than
finished points (cf. Chesier and Kelly 2006; Dawe 1987; Newlander and Speth 2009).
By A.D. 1300, if not earlier, substantially occupied “villages” were established across much of the larger
region. This was part of widespread pattern of greater sedentism and village formation across the southern
Great Plains and Jornada Mogollon region in the early to mid-second millennium A.D. (Brooks 2004;
Campbell 1976; Drass 1998; Drass and Flynn 1990; Jelinek 1967; Kalasz et al. 1999:195–198; Kelley 1984;
Lintz 1984, 1986, 1991; Lutes 1959; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Speth 2004, 2005; Speth and Newlander
2012; Wendorf 1960; Wiseman 1981, 1985, 2002; Zamora and Oakes 2000). Most of what we know about
Late Formative “village” sites in the region comes from excavations carried out decades ago, using premodern methods. A cluster of villages were occupied in the project vicinity at the Andrews Lake site,
several of which have been excavated (Collins 1966, 1968). Jennings (1940) excavations at Rio Peñasco
and two neighboring sites provide a glimpse of Late Formative village life in the Mountain Slope area.
Decades ago the Lea County Archaeological Society (LCAS) excavated several village sites, including
Boot Hill (Corley and Leslie 1960) and Laguna Plata (LCAS 1971). Eastern New Mexico University’s
subsequent excavations at Laguna Plata (Haskell 1977) and TRC’s recent investigations at Laguna Plata
(Brown 2010) and Boot Hill (Brown 2011) added additional information about these two important sites.
In addition, as part of the BLM CFO Permian Basin Mitigation Program in New Mexico, recent
investigations were carried out at the Maroon Cliffs, a sprawling site complex west of the project area that
includes substantial remains of Late Formation occupations (Stowe and Condon 2012). Survey-level
investigations have also documented sites with intensive Late Formative occupations in the Mescalero Plain
and Escarpment Base areas. These include Indian Hill (LA 32228, also known as Taylor Peak), where a
burial, a pit house, and charred maize were found (Hunt 1989), and a sprawling site complex in the vicinity
of the Merchant site (Lone Mountain Archaeological Services [LMAS] 2001). Late Formative village sites
tend to occur in areas where springs, precipitation runoff, or playa lakes offered reliable sources of surface
water, and at least limited riparian environments and associated resources. The base of the Mescalero
Escarpment was an especially favored zone for these sites.
As far as detailed information pertaining to the role of maize in Late Formative subsistence economies of
west Texas and southeastern New Mexico, the closest comparative evidence we have to date comes from
two settlements west of Roswell, New Mexico: Henderson and Bloom Mound (Kelley 1984; Powell 2001;
Speth 2004, 2005). For these sites, the evidence
points to farming as a modest contributor to the diet throughout, with little or no indication
of significant intensification in the later part of the sequence (e.g., small numbers of

recovered maize remains; ubiquity and abundance of wild seeds; carbon isotope values
indicating modest overall intake of C4 plants; low incidence of [dental] caries; small
numbers of metates, mostly basin-shaped; and wholly unstandardized one- and twohanded manos). (Speth and LeDuc 2007:46)
Another important subsistence trend that inhabitants of these Late Formative villages were caught up in
was an increased emphasis on bison hunting across the region and elsewhere in the southern Plains after
ca. A.D. 1250, following a regional hiatus in bison hunting that began in A.D. 500 (Baugh 1986; Bozell
1995; Brooks 2004; Collins 1968, 1971; Creel 1991; Dillehay 1974; Drass and Flynn 1990; Greer 1976;
Hughes 1989; Jelinek 1967; Speth 1979, 1983, 1984, 2004; Speth and Parry 1978, 1980; Spielmann 1991;
Staley 1996). At some point during the Formative time frame, people on the Plains began killing bison
beyond what was required for their own subsistence and other resource needs, and traded hides, dried meat,
and perhaps other products to the more settled farmers to the west (Creel 1991; Speth 2004, 2005; Speth
and Newlander 2012; Spielmann 1991). Creel (1991) argues that this regional exchange system was
underway around or soon after A.D. 1300, with the key archaeological indicators being the appearance in
the southern Plains of numerous beveled knives and endscrapers that were used to process bison hides.
As for far west Texas and southeastern New Mexico, at present we have mostly indirect evidence as to the
role of Late Formative peoples in the Pueblo-Plains interaction sphere. Creel (1991:41) reports that this
exchange system extended all the way down to present-day Chihuahua. Occasional bison remains also
appear in Late Formative sites in the western Jornada Mogollon (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:250), and it
seems likely that bison hides (which would not show up in the faunal record) were probably traded to the
people of the El Paso phase (A.D. 1250/1300–1450). Late Formative villagers in west Texas and far
southeastern New Mexico would have been well positioned as the most likely suppliers of bison products
to the western Jornada Mogollon and settled groups further to the south. But it still remains an open question
whether, and if so to what extent, Late Formative villagers developed an export economy fueled by bison
products. Further research is needed to elucidate the details pertaining to this question.

Post-Formative (A.D. 1450–1500)
The Post-Formative begins with the widespread abandonment of late prehistoric villages in the southern
Plains around A.D. 1450, as groups throughout the region shifted to a more nomadic lifeway centered more
squarely on bison hunting (Baugh 1986; Bozell 1995; Brooks 2004; Collins 1968, 1971; Creel 1991;
Dillehay 1974; Drass and Flynn 1990; Greer 1976; Hughes 1989; Jelinek 1967; Speth 1979, 1983, 1984,
2004; Speth and Parry 1978, 1980; Spielmann 1991). Archaeologically, this period is somewhat of a
phantom, as many of the diagnostic ceramic types largely disappeared along with village sites. Ceramics
are either absent in the region at this time or, to the extent they were still in use, consist of types that are
largely unknown (Katz and Katz 1993). Side-notched arrow points, similar to those that appeared after A.D.
1200 (see above), continued into this period until an unknown date and were eventually replaced by metal
arrow points and firearms.
As part of the shift to nomadism during post-Formative times, it is reasonable to expect that tipis became a
more common dwelling form. Seymour (2002, 2004; LMAS 2001) has identified tipi rings in both the
western Jornada Mogollon and far southeastern New Mexico. She argues that tipi rings in the region are
very late in time, postdating other types of structures, and even concludes that at least some are late
nineteenth century Apache or Comanche dwellings. Such conclusions lack supporting evidence, however
(see Kenmotsu et al. 2009:96–97). Tipi rings date back several thousand years on the Plains, and it is
entirely possible that at least some tipi rings in the project vicinity predate the post-Formative time frame.
By A.D. 1500, if not earlier, people on the southern Plains had given up their attempts at village life, with
its mixed focus on farming and bison hunting, and had become nomadic, tipi-dwelling bison hunters. This

probably occurred at least in part due to increased demand from the pueblos for bison products and other
resources from the southern Plains (such as Alibates and Edwards chert). One intriguing trend that may
characterize post-Formative occupations in the region of project area is the increased use of obsidian, most
of which appears to derive from sources in northern Chihuahua and southwestern New Mexico (Kenmotsu
et al. 2009:92). This apparent trend was also noted in the Middle Pecos River valley (northwest of the
region) by Jelinek (1967). Within the project region, however, Jemez Mountain obsidians are also found in
apparent protohistoric contexts, although the source of these could actually be Rio Grande gravels in the
western Jornada Mogollon region (Stein 2011).

2.3

Pre-field Investigations

SWCA performed a cultural resources file records review on July 14, 2016, to determine whether the project
area had been previously surveyed for cultural resources and whether any archaeological sites have been
recorded within 500 m (1,640 feet) to 1 km (0.6 mile) of the project area. To conduct this review, SWCA
project manager Amanda Cohen reviewed the following 7.5-minute quadrangles at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL): Orla and Screw Bean Draw East. In addition, the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) database and site files at TARL were also
searched. These sources provide information on the nature and location of previously conducted
archaeological surveys, previously recorded cultural resource sites, locations of National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) properties, sites designated as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), Official Texas
Historical Markers, Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys.
One previously recorded site, 41RV15, was identified approximately 411 feet (125.25 m) north of the
project area. No previous surveys were identified.

2.4

Methods

Since all land surveyed is on lands managed by TX GLO, official state permitting under the Antiquities
Code of Texas was required before initiation of work.

2.5

Pedestrian Survey and Field Recording

Survey and site recording were performed in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (13 Texas Administrative Code [TAC] 26.20), THC policy, and the Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (36 Code of Federal Regulations 800). A 100 percent (intensive)
cultural resources pedestrian inventory was conducted by SWCA archaeologists by walking parallel
transects spaced no more than 15 m (49 feet) apart. The survey and recording were conducted during one
session occurring in August 2016. Kevin Pintz served as the Field Supervisor, with Courtney Blair
providing field support.
Recording of newly discovered cultural locations was initiated with the pin-flagging of artifacts and other
cultural manifestations. IFs were defined by five or fewer artifacts, an isolated feature with no potential for
dating, or finds that were not related to other nearby IFs or sites. Archaeological sites are defined as
locations dating to an age or likely age of 50 years (pre-1966) or more that contained six or more artifacts
or as a feature or features in association with any artifacts meeting the 50-year age criterion.
For each cultural resource encountered, all surface artifacts and features were individually flagged and
recorded using a global positioning system (GPS) unit with sub-meter capabilities. For debitage, maximum
flake size in 1-cm increments (e.g., 0–1 cm, 1–2 cm, 2–3 cm, 3–4 cm, 4–5 cm, and 5+ cm), percent cortex,
and material type were recorded. For ground stone, cores, and lithic tools, type (e.g., mano, projectile point,
core, metate, biface, etc.); maximum length, width, and thickness (in cm); completeness (broken or

Reeves County, Texas

complete); material; and percent cortex were recorded. Recorded ceramic attributes included ware, type,
form (e.g., bowl, jar, plate, etc.), and portion (e.g., rim, body, etc.). All projectile points and other formal
tools were photographed with a centimeter scale. Other objects, including ceramics, bifaces, and ground
stone, were representatively photographed sufficient to illustrate assemblage diversity. No artifacts were
collected during the investigation.
When 100 or fewer artifacts were observed at a site, all surface artifacts were recorded. At sites with more
than 100 artifacts, concentrations were defined and detailed information as described above was recorded
on at least 100 artifacts. Lithic tools and ground stone artifacts, as well as features, were fully recorded. All
field records from the survey are on file at SWCA’s Albuquerque office.
Eleven IFs and three prehistoric archaeological sites were documented within the project area in Texas. The
IFs consist of prehistoric flaked stone debitage, lithic tools, and lithic manufacturing items. The prehistoric
sites are artifact scatters with no associated features. The sites identified during the survey are recommended
not eligible for the NRHP within the surveyed corridor, and were not recorded or assessed for eligibility
outside the proposed corridor.

2.6

Shovel Tests

In total, 29 shovel tests were excavated in support of the project. Prior to conducting fieldwork, Natural
Resources Conservation Service (2016) soil surveys within the project area and geologic maps were
consulted in order to assess the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits. THC archaeological standards
specify that a minimum of 16 shovel tests are required per mile within a survey corridor of 30.5 m (100
feet) unless surface visibility is greater than 30 percent. Shovel tests are implemented in order to determine
the presence or absence of buried cultural deposits deeper than 10 cm, or deeper than depths normally
accessible through trowel testing, and therefore, to support or negate recommendations of eligibility. Areas
with the potential for buried deposits were identified and subsequently assessed in the field. The SWCA
survey placed an additional 18 shovel tests across three newly documented sites. Shovel tests were
excavated 10 to 46 cm below the ground surface and were terminated when subsurface artifacts, features,
or pre-Holocene sub-soils (caliche layers) were encountered. Matrix fill was sifted through ⅛-inch mesh
screen. Shovel tests were typically not performed when the surface visibility was greater than 30 percent.
Locations and results of the shovel tests excavated within archaeological sites are included in Appendix B.
Cultural locations were described and recorded according to current archaeological standards and were
mapped with a Trimble GeoXH GPS receiver. Resource recording included preparing a plan map (postfield, using GPS data); taking site overview, feature, and artifact photographs; completing a TARL database
form; recording artifacts and features; and GPS recording resource boundaries to sub-meter level.

2.7

Eligibility

All cultural resources were assessed for eligibility to the NRHP in part following the requirements of 13
TAC 26.20 and defined in 13 TAC 26.5. These standards establish that a site is eligible when:
•
•
•

A radiocarbon (C14) dateable feature is present.
A dateable assemblage with proven depositional potential (buried artifacts or features) is
present.
Proven depositional potential is present (buried artifacts or features).

Recommendations for eligibility and management were made by the Principal Investigator and her staff in
consultation with the performing archaeology field crew and the field data.

3 FIELD SURVEY AND RESULTS
From August 15 to 17, 2016, SWCA archaeologists Kevin Pintz and Courtney Blair conducted an
archaeological survey following the staked centerline. Enterprise’s Orla Gas Gathering System would have
4 km (25 miles) of natural gas buried pipelines, two central delivery points, and a future cryogenic
processing plant, starting in southern Eddy County, New Mexico, traveling southerly to an east-west lateral
through Culberson County, Texas, to a future cryogenic processing plant in Reeves County, Texas. This
report documents the 1.6-km (1-mile) survey on the TX GLO land. Conditions for the survey were fair. The
survey area had been heavily disturbed by road and transmission infrastructure construction associated with
oil and gas activities to the north of the centerline, while south of the centerline had little to no disturbance
by roads and construction disturbance. Vegetation was low to high in occurrence, and ground visibility
ranged from 40 to 80 percent.
Eleven IFs and three prehistoric archaeological sites were documented within the project area. The IFs
consist of prehistoric flaked stone debitage, lithic tools, and lithic manufacturing items. All three of the
prehistoric sites are artifact scatters with no associated features. Three sites—41RV104, 41RV105, and
41RV106—are recommended not eligible for the NRHP within the surveyed corridor, and were not
recorded or assessed outside the proposed corridor.

Additional Site Numbers: 41RV104 (SWCA Temporary Site No.)
USGS: Orla (31103-G8)
County: Reeves
Elevation: 918 m (3,012 feet)
Landowner: Texas State Land
Cultural Affiliation and Age: Unknown aboriginal (9500 B.C.–A.D. 1550)
Site Type: Artifact scatter
Size: 2,136.55 m2 (22,997.63 square feet, or 0.53 acre)
NRHP Eligibility Recommendation: Not eligible
Management Recommendations: Most of Site 41RV104 is within the APE and will be impacted by the
proposed project. Site 41RV104 is recommended not eligible for the NRHP and no further work is
recommended.
Site Description
Site 41RV104 is a light lithic artifact scatter of indeterminate affiliation in a nearly level to gently sloping
desert scrubland (Figure 3.1–Figure 3.3). Slope is approximately 1 degree with a western aspect. Views in
excess of 8 km (5 miles) are available in all directions; the Salt Creek is approximately 1.87 km (1.16 miles)
to the west, and the Pecos River (Red Bluff Reservoir) is approximately 11.06 km (6.87 miles) to the
northeast. Prehistorically, the Pecos River was likely a reliable water source for both people and game. The
location of the site likely relates to its proximity to the river. The site measures 51.41 × 45.72 m (168.67 ×
150 feet) in size. Site 41RV105 is located about 525 m (2,329 feet) to the west. Overall surface visibility is
good, approximately 70 to 90 percent, with some areas obscured by sparse desert scrubland vegetation,
including creosote bush, mesquite, prickly pear cactus, and bunch grasses. The soil on the site’s surface is
highly degraded from eolian and alluvial activities. Most of the vegetation surrounds the site boundary. The
surface has a light to moderate surface gravels across the site of chert, quartzite, chalcedony, and limestone.
The natural gravels are a good source of raw material for lithic procurement.

Cultural Resources Survey on Texas State Land for the Orla Gas Gathering System – Culberson Lateral Project in
Reeves County, Texas

SWCA archaeologists visited this site on August 15, 2016. In total, 33 lithic artifacts were recorded at the
site including 24 pieces of lithic debitage, six cores and tested cobbles, and three modified flakes. No
features were observed. Six shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 43 cm to determine the
subsurface potential of the site. Shovel tests were concentrated in the center and southern side of the site
within the survey corridor only; three were placed along the center within the permanent ROW, two on the
southern portion of the corridor, and one in the northern portion of the corridor. All contained high amounts
of alluvial and caliche gravels, confirming the deflated nature of the landform. All shovel tests terminated
at compact caliche and were negative. The site was documented only within the survey corridor; however,
the site potentially extends to the north and south.
Site 41RV104 appears to be in fair condition, estimated to be 50 percent intact, with impacts from
construction/land development, erosion, and rodent borrows. An existing transmission line and associated
access roads are located in the site boundary within the survey corridor, approximately 14 m (46 feet) north
of the centerline. The entire northern survey corridor follows along the transmission line. Tracks from heavy
machinery, likely associated with nearby oil and gas infrastructure activities, crisscross the site. This
activity has likely dispersed, destroyed, and reburied artifacts through the northern portion of the site. Minor
alluvial and eolian erosion has directly impacted the site’s surface. The soil is highly degraded with multiple
washes running down the west-trending slope, which has negatively impacted the site condition and has
likely resulted in artifact dispersion during heavy rains. Site 41RV104 is within the APE and will be
impacted by the proposed project.

Features
No features were identified at 41RV104.
Materials Identified
All 33 lithic artifacts were recorded at the site including 24 pieces of lithic debitage, six cores and tested
cobbles, and three modified flake tools. The artifacts at the site indicate a lithic procurement and early-stage
reduction site. The point-located artifacts were identified within the survey corridor and spread throughout
the site. Lithic materials consisted of limestone, quartzite, chert and chalcedony with maximum lengths
ranging from 2 to over 5 cm (Table 3.1, Figure 3.4). Analysis of the debitage indicates that flakes with 50+
percent cortex constitute the majority (~42 percent, n = 10) of the assemblage. Approximately 33 percent
are flakes with ≤ 50 percent cortex (n = 8), approximately 17 percent are flakes with no cortex (n = 4), and
about 8 percent is cortical shatter (n = 2) (see Table 3.1). Lithic tools consisted of three edge-modified
flakes (Table 3.2, Figure 3.5). Lithic reduction tools at the site consist of three tested cobbles, two
multidirectional cores, and one bidirectional core (Table 3.3). All artifacts were identified within the APE.
No ceramics or ground stone artifacts were observed during this investigation.

Site Interpretation and Summary
Site 41RV104 is a lithic scatter of indeterminate cultural and temporal origin, estimated 50 percent intact
with primary impacts to site integrity from alluvial erosion, land development, and the activities of heavy
machinery. Lithic procurement and early-stage reduction activities likely occurred at the site. Site 41RV104
is interpreted as a limited activity area for a small group of people during their travels throughout the area.
The site is located within proximity to other lithic procurement sites, such as 41RV15 located approximately
123 m (404 feet) to the north and 41RV105 located approximately 525 m (2,329 feet) to the west. The
proximity to Salt Creek and the Pecos River, as well as the availability of natural gravels of chert, quartzite,
and limestone, may have made this a desirable location for limited use. No structural features, thermal
staining, or burned caliche concentrations were observed that would indicate a more intensive use of the
site.
Eligibility Recommendations
Site 41RV104 is an unspecified aboriginal lithic scatter located on a relatively flat plain with a 1 degree
west-trending slope. The site is located approximately 1.87 km (1.16 miles) east of Salt Creek, 11.06 km
(6.87 miles) southwest of the Pecos River (Red Bluff Reservoir), and 21.19 km (13.17 miles) south of the
New Mexico-Texas state line. Site 41RV104 is in fair condition with disturbances from modern
developments like nearby transmission line installation and continued vehicle activity along the associated
access road. Six shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 43 centimeters below surface (cmbs).
Shovel tests were placed only within the survey corridor; three were placed along the centerline, two on the
southern edge of the survey corridor, and one just north of the centerline. All contained high amounts of
alluvial and caliche gravels confirming the deflated nature of the landform. No cultural materials were
found in the shovel tests.
Site 41RV104 is not associated with any significant event or person and is therefore not eligible under
Criteria A or B. Its construction does not embody the work of a master and is therefore not eligible under
Criterion C. The site was thoroughly investigated within the survey corridor and is believed not to harbor
additional information potential to suggest it would be eligible under Criterion D; however, portions of the
site outside of the proposed corridor are considered undetermined. The site retains integrity of location, but
lacks integrity of setting and feeling because it is located within a landscape marred by modern development
and has changed from the time the site was likely occupied. Site 41RV104 has diminished integrity of
design and materials because construction activities and alluvial erosion through the site have displaced
artifacts from their original locations, obscuring in situ intra-site activity areas. Finally, the site lacks
integrity of association and workmanship because the artifact assemblage cannot be linked to a specific
cultural group or time period. Based on this assessment, it is SWCA’s recommendation that the site will
not yield information that would further our understanding of the prehistory of the area. Therefore, site
41RV104 is recommended not eligible to the NRHP under any criteria.
Management Recommendations
The site is within the APE and will be impacted by the proposed project. The artifacts recorded are typical
for this area and are in low numbers. All artifacts were completely documented. The shovel tests indicate
that there are no subsurface cultural deposits. The site is recommended not eligible for the NRHP and no
further work is recommended.

NRHP Eligibility Recommendation: Not eligible
Management Recommendations: The site 41RV105 is within the APE and will be impacted by the
proposed project. Site 41RV105 is recommended not eligible for the NRHP and no further work is
recommended.
Site Description
Site 41RV105 is a moderate lithic artifact scatter of indeterminate affiliation measuring 91.25 × 45.72 m
(27.81 × 13.93 feet) in nearly level to gently sloping desert scrubland (Figure 3.6. –Figure 3.8). Slope is
approximately 1 degree with a west-southwest aspect. Views in excess of 8 km (5 miles) are available in
all directions; Salt Creek is approximately 1.28 km (0.80 mile) to the west, and the Pecos River (Red Bluff
Reservoir) is approximately 11 km (6.83 miles) to the northeast. The Pecos River was a reliable water
source for prehistoric people and game and the site’s location is likely related to the river. Site 41RV104 is
located about 525 m (2,329 feet) to the east and Site 41RV106 is located about 174 m (571 feet) to the west.
Overall surface visibility is good, approximately 70 to 90 percent, with some areas obscured by ground
vegetation, including an understory of creosote bush, mesquite, and various other mixed grasses and forbs.
The surface has a moderate to dense surface gravels present across the site of chert, quartzite, chalcedony,
and limestone. The natural gravels are a good source of raw material for lithic procurement.
SWCA archaeologists visited this site on August 15, 2016. Fifty-two lithic artifacts were recorded at the
site including 42 pieces of lithic debitage, nine cores and tested cobbles, and one modified flake. No features
were observed. Seven shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 34 cm. All contained high
amounts of alluvial and caliche gravels. All shovel tests terminated at compact sterile sediment with mass
calcium carbonates and were negative. Intact subsurface cultural deposits are not anticipated; if present, the
nature of deposition suggests that subsurface deposits would not exceed 10 cm in depth and would lack
integrity due to the impacts from modern development. Shovel tests were concentrated in the center of the
site within the survey corridor only; five were placed near the centerline, two on the northern and southern
edges of the corridor. The site was documented only within the survey corridor; however, the site potentially
extends to the north and south.
The site appears to be in fair condition, estimated to be 50 percent intact with construction/land
development, erosion, and rodent burrows impacting site condition. Activities associated with land
development are the most prominent source of disturbance to the site. A development corridor with an
access road and a transmission line is located within the survey corridor approximately 39 to 46 m (128–
151 feet) to the north of centerline. This construction activity falls within the site boundary. Push piles and
vehicle tracks associated with the transmission line and access roads are within the site boundary. The
construction activity through this area has likely dispersed, destroyed, and reburied artifacts. Minor to
moderate alluvial and eolian activity has directly impacted the site. Winds have exposed caliche bedrock
and multiple alluvial washes run downslope, possibly resulting in secondary deposition and dispersion
during heavy rains. The site is within the APE and will be impacted by the proposed project.

cobbles, and one modified flake. The artifacts at the site represent a lithic procurement and early-stage
reduction site. The single point-located artifact was identified near the edge of the transmission corridor on
the northeast corner of the site. Lithic materials consisted of chert, chalcedony, and quartzite with maximum
lengths ranging from 2 to over 5 cm. Analysis of the debitage indicates that flakes with 50+ percent cortex
constitute the majority (~45 percent, n = 19) of the assemblage. Approximately 31 percent are flakes with
≤ 50 percent cortex (n = 13), approximately 14 percent is cortical shatter (n = 6), approximately 5 percent
are flakes with no cortex (n = 2), and about 2 percent are non-cortical shatter (n = 2) (Table 3.4, Figure 3.9).
Lithic tools consisted of a single point-located artifact, a modified flake (PL 1), measuring 4 × 2.2 × 0.9 cm
with 1 to 50 percent cortex. The modified flake has fine retouching on two edges and utilized on one edge.
One of the modified edges is steep while the other is acute (Figure 3.10). Lithic reduction tools at the site
consist of six tested cobbles and three cores—one multidirectional, one bidirectional, and one unidirectional
(Table 3.5). The cores and tested cobbles are mainly located on the eastern and southern extents of the site.
All artifacts were identified within the APE. No ceramics or ground stone artifacts were identified during
this investigation.

Site Chronology
The lack of temporal or diagnostic materials at this site precludes determination of cultural affiliation further
than unspecified aboriginal, specifically unknown prehistoric (9500 B.C.–A.D. 1800). The site likely dates
to the prehistoric or protohistoric period.
Site Interpretation and Summary
Site 41RV105 is a lithic scatter of indeterminate cultural and temporal origin, estimated 50 percent intact
with primary impacts to site integrity from land development, heavy machinery, and alluvial and eolian
erosional activity. Lithic procurement and early-stage reduction activities likely occurred at the site. Site
41RV105 is interpreted as a limited activity area for a small group of people during their travels throughout
the area. The site is located within proximity to other lithic procurement sites, such as 41RV15 located
approximately 154 m (507 feet) to the north, 41RV104 located approximately 525 m (2,329 feet) to the

east, and 41RV106 located 174 m (571 feet) to the west. The proximity to Salt Creek and the Pecos River,
as well as the availability of natural gravels of chert, quartzite, and limestone, may have made this a
desirable location for limited use. No structural features, thermal staining, or burned caliche concentrations
were observed that would indicate a more intensive use of the site.
Eligibility Recommendations
Site 41RV105 is an unspecified aboriginal lithic scatter located on a relatively flat plain approximately 1.28
km (0.80 mile) east of Salt Creek, 11 km (6.83 miles) southwest of the Pecos River (Red Bluff Reservoir),
and 21.27 km (13.22 miles) south of the New Mexico-Texas state line. Site 41RV105 is in fair condition
with disturbances from modern developments like the nearby transmission line installation and continued
vehicle activity along the associated access road. Seven shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth
of 34 cmbs. All contained high amounts of alluvial and caliche gravels confirming the deflated nature of
the landform. Shovel tests were placed throughout the site within the survey corridor; no cultural materials
were found.
Site 41RV105 is not associated with any significant event or person and is therefore not eligible under
Criteria A or B. Its construction does not embody the work of a master and is therefore not eligible under
Criterion C. The site was thoroughly investigated within the survey corridor and is believed not to harbor
additional information potential to suggest it would be eligible under Criterion D; however, portions of the
site outside the proposed corridor are considered undetermined. The site retains integrity of location, but
lacks integrity of setting and feeling because it is located within a landscape marred by modern development
and has changed from the time the site was likely occupied. Site 41RV105 has diminished integrity of
design and materials because construction activities and alluvial and eolian erosion through the site have
displaced artifacts from their original locations, obscuring in situ intra-site activity areas. Finally, the site
lacks integrity of association and workmanship because the artifact assemblage cannot be linked to a
specific cultural group or time period. Based on this assessment, it is SWCA’s recommendation that the
site will not yield information that would further our understanding of the prehistory of the area. Therefore,
41RV105 is recommended not eligible to the NRHP under any criteria.
Management Recommendations
The site is within the APE and will be impacted by the proposed project. The artifacts recorded are typical
for this area and are in low numbers. All artifacts were completely documented. The shovel tests indicate
that there are no subsurface cultural deposits. The site is recommended not eligible for the NRHP and no
further work is recommended.

Site Description
Site 41RV106 is a moderate lithic artifact scatter of indeterminate affiliation measuring 105.46 × 45.72 m
(346 × 13.93 feet) in nearly level to gently sloping desert scrubland (Figure 3.11–Figure 3.14). Slope is
approximately 1 to 5 degrees with a western aspect. The eastern edge of the site has a slight flat ridge that
proceeds to drop and slope to the west. Views in excess of 8 km (5 miles) are available in all directions;
Salt Creek is approximately 1.02 km (0.64 mile) to the west, and the Pecos River (Red Bluff Reservoir) is
approximately 11.03 km (6.85 miles) to the northeast. The Pecos River was a reliable water source for
prehistoric people and game and the site’s location is likely related to the river. Site 41RV105 is located
about 174 m (571 feet) to the east. Overall surface visibility is good, approximately 75 to 85 percent, with
some areas obscured by bunch grasses. Other than bunch grasses, vegetation is sparse and includes an
understory of creosote bush, mesquite, and soaptree yucca. The surface has dense surface gravels present
across the site of chert, quartzite, quartz, chalcedony, limestone, and sandstone. The natural gravels are a
good source of raw material for lithic procurement.
SWCA archaeologists visited this site on August 16, 2016. No features were observed, but 69 lithic artifacts
were recorded at the site including 58 pieces of lithic debitage, nine cores and tested cobbles, one modified
flake, one uniface, and one biface tool. Six shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 40 cm. All
shovel tests contained moderate amounts of calcium carbonate nodules and terminated at compact sterile
sediments with mass calcium carbonates. No cultural materials were found in any of the shovel tests. Intact
subsurface cultural deposits are not anticipated; if present, the nature of deposition suggests that subsurface
deposits would not exceed 10 cm in depth and would lack integrity due to the impacts from modern
development. Shovel tests were concentrated in the center and southern side of the site within the survey
corridor only; five were placed along the centerline, one on the southern edge of the corridor. The site was
documented only within the survey corridor; however, the site potentially extends to the north and south.
The site appears to be in fair condition, estimated to be 50 to 60 percent intact with alluvial erosion, rodent
burrows, and heavy construction activities and infrastructure negatively impacting site condition. Activities
associated with the construction of a transmission line are the most prominent source of disturbance to the
site. A development corridor with an access road and a transmission line is located about 10 m (33 feet) to
the north of centerline. Tire tracks and push piles are located all along edge of the corridor with the tracks
crossing the site even south of the centerline. The activity through this area has likely dispersed, destroyed,
and reburied artifacts. Soil at the site has been affected moderately by eolian and alluvial activity. Wind
and water has left little to no soil deposition and has potentially dispersed artifacts downslope during heavy
rains. The site is within the APE and will be impacted by the proposed project.

Features
No features were identified at 41RV106.
Materials Identified
All 69 lithic artifacts were recorded at the site including 58 pieces of lithic debitage, nine cores and tested
cobbles, and three lithic tools. The artifacts at the site represent a lithic procurement and early-stage
reduction site. Two point-located artifacts were identified in the southeastern portion of the site, and a single
point-located artifact was located downslope in the southwest corner of the site. Lithic materials consisted
of chert, chalcedony, sandstone, and quartz flakes with maximum lengths ranging from 2 to over 5 cm.
Analysis of the debitage indicates that flakes with 50+ percent cortex constitute the majority (~35 percent,
n = 20) of the assemblage. Approximately 31 percent are cortical shatter (n = 18), approximately 24 percent
are flakes with ≤ 50 percent cortex (n = 14), and approximately 10 percent are flakes with no cortex (n = 6)
(see Table 3.6, Figure 3.15). Lithic tools consisted of a one modified flake, one uniface, and a single biface
(Table 3.7, Figure 3.16). Lithic reduction tools at the site consist of eight tested cobbles and one
unidirectional core (Table 3.8). The majority of the cores and tested cobbles are located in the eastern edge
of the site. The eastern extent of the site is located on a small ridge covered in natural gravels that were
used during the procurement process. All artifacts were identified within the APE. No ceramics or ground
stone artifacts were identified during this investigation.

Reeves County, Texas

4 DISCUSSION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
An archaeological survey of 17.73 acres for the Enterprise Orla Gas Gathering System – Culberson Lateral
Project on state land in Texas resulted in the discovery of three sites (41RV104, 41RV105, and 41RV106)
and 11 IFs. The three sites and the IFs are considered not eligible for the NRHP.
Sites 41RV104, 41RV105, and 41RV106 were recorded only within the survey area and not outside the
survey corridor. The sites are considered not eligible for the NRHP under any criterion within the survey
corridor. All three sites may extend outside the survey corridor, but that portion of the site was not recorded
or assessed for eligibility. The sites do not likely contain buried deposits that would have research potential
to address research domains for this area in Texas. Specifically, these sites do not have the potential to yield
information that would aid in understanding prehistoric mobility and subsistence strategies in the area. No
further management of sites 41RV104, 41RV105, and 41RV106 is recommended. The 11 Ifs, by definition,
are not eligible for the NRHP. No further management of these resources is recommended. SWCA
recommends that the proposed project will have no adverse effect on prehistoric properties and that it be
allowed to proceed as planned. Site summaries, eligibility, and mitigation recommendations are provided
below in Table 4.1.
