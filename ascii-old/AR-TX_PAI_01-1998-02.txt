ABSTRACT
This catalogue is designed as a companion volume to Nineteenth-Century Transfer-Printed Ceramics from the
Townsite of Old Velasco (41BO125), Brazoria County, Texas: An Illustrated Catalogue, by Pollan et al. (1996). The
transfer-printed ceramics presented here are based on a collection from the neighboring town of Quintana (41BO135).
The patterns date between ca. 1820 and 1880, with most from the period of 1830–1850. This catalogue features new
patterns and aspects of patterns not illustrated in the Velasco catalogue. It offers large photographs for ease of
identification, as well as text detailing the border, pattern, view, marks, vessel form and size, colors illustrated and
recovered, maker, importer, date, and references. A section of color plates is provided to illustrate the range of colors
represented in the collection.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The successful completion of this volume was made possible by the coordinated efforts of many individuals. As
with much of the work done on the lower Brazos River, our efforts were greatly aided by members of the Brazosport
Archaeological Society (BAS). The ceramics that are the subject of this catalogue are from an extensive surface
collection made by BAS members during the late 1980s as erosion exposed deposits at Quintana. Following collection of the artifacts, BAS members did much of the initial sorting, approximately half of the pattern identification,
and a fair amount of the reconstructive crossmending.
Special thanks go to BAS members Sandra D. Pollan, Johnney Pollan, and Judy Wayland for their interest and
efforts on behalf of the catalogue. They facilitated transfer of the ceramics collection from the Brazosport Museum of
Natural Science in Lake Jackson, Texas. They were of great assistance in familiarizing Prewitt and Associates staff with
the collection. Also, Sandra was kind enough to loan several hard-to-find ceramic reference books on behalf of the
project. In addition, Sandra and Johnney reviewed a draft of the catalogue and provided many useful comments and
corrections. As always, their knowledge, friendliness, and hospitality were much appreciated.
Since the primary function of this catalogue is to serve as a reference, the clarity of illustrative materials is key.
Jack Rehm and Jim Cazares took the outstanding black-and-white and color photographs and provided prints and
negatives for computer scanning. It was a pleasure working with such efficient professionals.
A variety of staff members at Prewitt and Associates served important roles in the production of the catalogue.
Elton Prewitt and Ross Fields served as co-principal investigators. Elton coordinated with Carolyn Good Murphy at
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District, while Ross oversaw scheduling and provided editing and
management advice. Melissa Hennigan was the primary editor of the text, and Linda Foster also provided editing
input. Brian Wootan did the computer scanning of images as well as the layout of the body and cover of the catalogue.
His experience in these areas greatly enhanced the effectiveness of the visuals. Sandy Hannum drafted maps and
graphs that help to illustrate important attributes of the collection.
Karen Gardner was the project manager, and Marie E. Blake was the project historical archeologist. Karen and
Marie worked together on many aspects of the project, including retrieving the collection from Lake Jackson, overall
catalogue design, collection management in the lab, some crossmending, database management, and coordination
between editing and graphics personnel. In addition, Karen served as the organizing force behind the project, tending to matters large and small to ensure the overall quality and consistency of the catalogue. Marie’s additional
responsibilities included acquiring the ceramic reference books, sorting and identifying transfer-printed patterns
(beyond work done by the BAS), entering information into the database, selecting patterns and representative examples for inclusion in the catalogue, and writing all text except for the history.
Consulting historian Martha Doty Freeman wrote the background history section. Her exhaustive primary
research provided a context for understanding events in nineteenth-century Quintana. Her willingness to share her
knowledge and research made her a valuable part of the team.
Special thanks go to several people. First, thanks to Dr. Teresita Majewski, who is a preeminent scholar in the
field of historic ceramics. At the request of the Galveston District of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, she reviewed
the draft of the Quintana catalogue. Her meticulous attention to the details and substantive issues presented made her
corrections and comments immensely useful and greatly enhanced the overall quality of the catalogue.
Second, thanks to Miranda Goodby, Keeper of Ceramics at the Pottery Museum, Stoke-on-Trent, England. She
provided the most up-to-date information on several of the potteries when the published references were not current.
A final special thanks goes to Carolyn Good Murphy at the Galveston District of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers for her oversight of the project, her thoughful comments on the work in progress, and review comments
on the draft report. Her enthusiam for the early history of Quintana and Velasco made this catalogue possible.

INTRODUCTION
Production of this volume was prompted by the
further work of Prewitt and Associates under contract
with the Galveston District of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers on the Freeport Harbor 45-Foot Navigation
Improvement Project. This long-term project consists
of deepening, realigning, and enlarging the present
Brazos River channel entrance and turning basins. Also
included in the effort is relocation of the north jetty and
the U.S. Coast Guard station and construction of shore
protection, breakwaters, and public use facilities (Earls
et al. 1996:1). This construction impacts two early Texas
townsites, Velasco (41B0125) and Quintana (41BO135)
(Figure 1). As a result, a series of archeological and historical studies has been done to mitigate the loss of these
sites. Two studies pertaining to Velasco were completed

in 1996: Testing and Data Recovery at the Townsite of
Old Velasco (41BO125), Brazoria County, Texas, by Earls
et al. (1996); and Nineteenth-Century Transfer-Printed
Ceramics from the Townsite of Old Velasco (41BO125),
Brazoria County, Texas: An Illustrated Catalogue, by
Pollan et al. (1996).
More-recent studies deal with the submerged townsite of Quintana. Presented here is a catalogue of a sample
of the ceramics recovered by avocational archeologists
as parts of the site have been exposed by erosion. Published as a separate volume is a comprehensive history of
Quintana based on primary research (Freeman 1998).
The history of Quintana, from its inception in 1834
until the present, has reflected events, personalities, and
economic factors that frequently originated at a great
distance from the town itself. A product of the ambitions of land promoters and colonizers in the American

The Quintana Collection

Southwest during the 1820s and 1830s, Quintana, like
the rest of the Republic of Texas, suffered the effects of
the Texas Revolution in 1836 and the National Panic of
1837. During the 1850s, Quintana benefited from a
burgeoning antebellum southern economy as immigrants
from southern states moved to Texas and created a
demand for goods that entered the state through coastal
towns. Conversely, it declined during the Civil War when
it became a focus of Federal blockaders that ranged the
length of the Texas gulf coast from Brownsville to Sabine
Pass. Its growth during the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries reflected the ambitions of local and
out-of-state capitalists who eagerly promoted the economic potential of Texas coastal communities as outlets
of trade from the state’s interior and also western cities
as distant as Denver, Colorado.
For more than a century, the land that comprised
the town was held closely by Stephen F. Austin and his
heirs, who believed that this was a potentially valuable
commercial site and would become a center for coastal
trade. Austin’s own interest in the area began in 1821,
when the schooner Lively mistakenly landed at the mouth
of the Brazos River rather than at the Colorado with his
first group of colonists. Three years later, entitled to 22½
leagues and 3 labors for having settled 300 families, he
selected one third of a league at the mouth of the Brazos
as a premium tract. By 1834, the tract had become the
location of an important commission house owned by
Thomas F. McKinney and Samuel May Williams.
McKinney and Williams’s business at Quintana
developed rapidly as they sold merchandise and equipment to planters, purchased farm products, arranged for
shipping, and exported cotton, sugar, and hides to commercial centers such as Galveston and New Orleans. In
keeping with the contemporary mania for townsite
development in the early years of the Republic, McKinney
arranged for the platting of the town and sale of lots
with considerable success. By the late 1830s, the small
community was the location of a score of homes and had
been selected as the location of a customhouse, a major
coup in the community’s ongoing competition with its
neighbor, Velasco, located across the Brazos River from
Quintana and also aspiring to be a coastal trade center.
Stephen F. Austin’s death in 1836 resulted in a bitter lawsuit among his heirs that was not settled until
1846, when the holdings of the estate were partitioned
between Emily M. and James F. Perry and Eliza M.
Westall Austin and William G. Hill. The greatest proportion of the Quintana town lots remained in the hands
of the Perrys and Hills, whose intent seems to have been
to sell enough lots in the town to sustain it as a thriving
concern without relinquishing overall control of property. However, their efforts were thwarted by a series of

catastrophic events beginning with Austin’s death and
including the filing of complicated lawsuits, the spread
of regional economic depression as a result of the Panic
of 1837, competition from the new port of Galveston,
and removal of McKinney and Williams’s trade house to
that city. Flood and drought beginning in about 1840
followed by fears of a Mexican invasion further impacted
the coastal economy, which did not recover until the
late 1840s.
By 1850, the prosperity that characterized agricultural production within the boundaries of Austin’s colony
had buoyed the prospects of coastal towns such as
Quintana. The following year, Senator Thomas J. Rusk,
Robert J. Walker, and ex-Senator T. Butler King of Georgia
sought to obtain a charter for a Southern Pacific railroad through Texas, and King made a trip to the mouth
of the Brazos, which he argued was the appropriate place
on the Gulf to make a terminal for the railroad. King’s
plan failed to materialize and a devastating storm hit
Brazoria County in 1854; however, Quintana grew
throughout the decade, attracting immigrants from five
European countries, Canada, Mexico, and 14 states. The
population was mature, male, and heavily involved in
occupations related to shipping. There was a school for
children in the community, and Quintana had captured
the post office from rival Velasco.
The Civil War brought a new kind of federal interest
to the Texas Gulf Coast, this time unwelcome, and coastal
communities such as Quintana, Velasco, and Galveston
became targets for Union gunboats seeking to interrupt
the flow of trade. Confederate troops under the direction of engineers constructed formidable defenses, not
only at the mouth of the Brazos River but also a short
distance up the river, where Fort Terrell was designed to
protect blockade runners using the canal between West
Galveston Bay and the Brazos.
The end of war in 1865 was followed by 35 years
of commercial development and renewed real estate
speculation as local and out-of-state entrepreneurs
promoted the idea of a major coastal port in the vicinity
of Quintana to state and federal legislators. The Brazos
Internal Improvement and Navigation Company, chartered in 1866, joined with the Texas Land and Immigration
Company to buy scores of lots and blocks in Quintana.
By the early 1870s, development of a port at the mouth
of the Brazos was seen as a serious threat to the port of
Galveston, and individuals such as John Adriance, Guy
M. Bryan, A. M. Lea, William J. Hutchins, Ira H. Evans,
W. W. Phelps, and Moses Taylor promoted the area in a
variety of ways. Quintana responded in kind, its citizens
buying and selling real estate at a noticeably greater pace,
and new businesses flourished. The federal government
remained ambiguous in its posture toward the area,

Introduction

investing modestly in projects to construct jetties. As a
result, improvements were carried out for the most part
by private capitalists. During the early 1890s, W. M. D.
Lee and John M. Ferguson employed construction
workers who crowded into Quintana, and by the end of
the decade, the town was home to a bustling community of almost 200 individuals.
On 8 September 1900, approximately one year after
the Brazos River valley was hit by a devastating flood,
coastal towns were struck by a hurricane. One resident
of Quintana remarked that nearly everything had been
destroyed, and commerce was effectively stifled for
almost a decade, after which town development focused
on the new community of Freeport approximately 5 miles
up the river. Discovery of sulfur deposits nearby attracted
new investors (such as the S. M. Swenson Company of
New York) who bought out the former holdings of the
Brazos River Channel and Dock Company in Quintana
and elsewhere. Then, with the success of the Freeport
Sulphur Company, the federal government became
seriously interested in funding improvements at the
mouth of the Brazos. During the 1920s and 1930s, a
river diversion project, dredging, and jetty construction
made possible the development of a major port, which
in turn profoundly changed the Quintana landscape.
Widening of the old river channel, construction of a turning basin, erection of a wave barrier, and bend easing
destroyed much of the historic townsite associated with
shipping, leaving remnants only in the portions south of
the nineteenth-century commercial center.
The mid- to late-twentieth-century construction
responsible for much of the destruction of Quintana also
represented the realization of a dream of commercial
development that had begun 150 years earlier. Although
the basis of the development—industrial—has been vastly
different from the agricultural development envisioned
earlier, the end result has been much the same. Throughout its history, the location has attracted entrepreneurial
investors, each of whom has changed the historic landscape in various ways. Today, that landscape remains a
function of acts of nature and the industrialization of
the Texas Gulf Coast.
BACKGROUND FOR THE CATALOGUE
This volume follows the precedent set with
Nineteenth-Century Transfer-Printed Ceramics from the
Townsite of Old Velasco (41B0125), Brazoria County,
Texas: An Illustrated Catalogue (Pollan et al. 1996). As
noted in that volume, little is known archeologically
about ceramic assemblages from Texas during the 1820s
to 1860s. The Velasco catalogue provides a baseline for
identification and comparison of transfer-printed earthen-

5

wares in Texas. It can also be used by researchers in other
areas for comparative purposes to study regional
variability, as noted by Samford (1997:25). Documenting
regional variability can help answer questions relating to
patterns of trade and consumer access as western and
frontier markets developed and expanded. For example,
are there significant differences between patterns, colors,
or manufacturers represented in eastern assemblages vs.
western assemblages? Are there differences between port
towns and inland settlements? Can these differences be
attributed to transportation limitations, variation in
economic practices, consumer choice, or a combination
of all these factors? As more is understood about the
characteristics of ceramic assemblages within each region,
they can be compared and contrasted with such questions
in mind. In an effort to expand the available data, this
companion volume illustrating 87 patterns has been
produced using the Brazosport Archeological Society’s
(BAS) previously unpublished collection from Velasco’s
neighbor, Quintana.
As with much of the work done on the lower Brazos,
Prewitt and Associates’ (PAI) efforts were greatly aided
by BAS members. The ceramics in this catalogue derive
from an extensive surface collection made by BAS
members during the late 1980s as erosion exposed
deposits at Quintana. Following collection of the
artifacts, BAS members did much of the groundwork
for the production of this catalogue, including the initial
sorting, approximately half of the pattern identification,
and a fair amount of the reconstructive crossmending in
order to facilitate pattern and vessel form identification.
Because the materials are from the surface, it is difficult
to associate them with specific businesses or habitations.
Nonetheless, they can be associated generally with
activities that occurred at Quintana.
Work on the collection at PAI began in late 1997
and progressed in several steps. Organization began with
an initial sorting of ceramics into three groups, maintaining their designated BAS collection areas and
separation by color. The groups consisted of identified
patterns, all flow blue and flow mulberry (some of which
had been identified), and unidentified patterns. Identified patterns were recorded first, then flow blue and flow
mulberry patterns were identified. The final step in the
process was examining all unanalyzed ceramics grouped
by color. Patterns were identified if possible, and the
data were entered into a master list. From that master
data set, patterns were selected for inclusion in this catalogue based on their contribution of new information
above and beyond that presented in the Velasco volume.
Representative sherds were chosen based on the presence
of diagnostic characteristics and sherd size. They were
then organized for photography by pattern.

The Quintana Collection

The Quintana catalogue benefits from the extensive discussions included in the Velasco catalogue.
Sections titled “Transfer-Printed Earthenwares” by
W. Sue Gross and “The Brazosport Archaeological
Society Transfer-Printed Ceramic Collection,” “Guidelines for Identifying Transfer-Printed Ceramics Using the
Catalogue,” and “Cautions for Identifying TransferPrinted Ceramics Using the Catalogue,” all by Sandra D.
Pollan, provide concise and useful coverage of the technique of transfer printing, the nature of the collections,
and the process of pattern identification. Since the
Quintana catalogue is designed as a companion volume
to Velasco, those discussions are not repeated here.
Researchers are referred to the Velasco catalogue, where
the methods outlined for the identification of transferprinted patterns are detailed. Those same methods were
used as guidelines for work on the Quintana collection.
This catalogue was produced in the same spirit as
its predecessor, although a few changes were made in
hopes of improving on an excellent resource. The greatest
difference is the change in layout. Since the primary function of the catalogue is as a reference manual, its usefulness lies in the clarity of the illustrations. This is especially
true for researchers attempting to identify transferprinted patterns on sherds from archeological sites. It is
vital that small features, such as string elements or
components of borders, be clearly visible. The most
effective way to accomplish that goal is to present illustrative material in a larger format; thus, each pattern is
shown at a size that most clearly displays its diagnostic
elements.
Although the change in format shifts the presentation of information somewhat, the same data are provided, in the same order as in the Velasco catalogue.
Each caption provides details pertaining to border,
pattern, view, marks, vessel form and size, color illustrated, colors recovered, maker, importer, summary date,
and references. The border, pattern, or view names used
are those given by the manufacturers; when proper names
are not known, attributed ones are used only when documented in previously published sources. Attributed names
are always enclosed in quotation marks. No new attributed names, numbers, or designations have been created
for this catalogue. When specifics are not known or not
available, this is stated. When appropriate, interesting
facts and the occasional cautionary note (such as possible
but unconfirmed makers) are provided in the narrative
in addition to the basic data. Because terms are sometimes used slightly differently by various researchers, a
glossary of pertinent terms is provided at the end of the
volume. Due to the nature of the collection, fewer vessels
were reconstructed, and therefore, considerably fewer
data on vessel form were derived from the Quintana

collection when compared to the Velasco collection.
When it was not possible to ascertain definite vessel form,
either “indeterminate hollowware form” or “indeterminate flatware form” was noted. The lower percentage of
reconstructed vessels available also influenced which
patterns could be documented photographically.
Because this volume is a companion to the Velasco
catalogue, an effort was made to limit redundancy
between the two. Selected for inclusion here are patterns
that are represented by sherds large enough to be
photographed and that were not included in the Velasco
volume, except in cases where an example from Quintana
has a diagnostic characteristic such as a maker’s mark or
a much larger section of the border. Hence, not all
patterns in the Quintana collection are presented here.
Table 1 presents a full summary of the patterns and colors
recovered at both Velasco and Quintana (with the
exception of BAS-numbered patterns recovered at
Velasco but not at Quintana). The Velasco ceramics listed
are only those included in the Velasco catalogue; all
patterns identified in the Quintana collection are listed.
Due to large differences between the collections
from Velasco and Quintana, only limited comparisons
can be made. Lack of well-defined provenience and
associations, as well as variation in methods of collection, crossmending, and analysis, forces commentary to
occupy only a general level. However, with that major
caveat in place, a few statements can be made. Despite
the ongoing competition between Velasco and Quintana
throughout the nineteenth century, both hold similar
places in the history of coastal Texas, and both would
have been part of the same trade network that received
goods imported to the mouth of the Brazos River. Based
on the data presented in Table 1, 235 patterns (not considering variations in views) were identified from the two
townsites together. Of those, 96 patterns were present
at both Velasco and Quintana, for a 41 percent overlap
in patterns between the two towns. Of the 186 patterns
identified at Velasco, 90 patterns (38 percent of the total)
are unique to that collection; of the 145 patterns identified at Quintana, 49 patterns (21 percent of the total)
are unique to the collection considered in this study.
Clearly there are many similarities between the towns
and the transfer-printed ceramic collections from them;
however, there are differences between the collections
that no clear causative relationships or individual factors
could easily account for. Taken together, the similarities
between the collections appear to be as significant as the
differences.
Although most of the introductory information
covered in the Velasco catalogue is not repeated here,

tableware vessel forms (Figure 2) and a diagram of the

*Pattern names listed in quotation marks are attributed names from published references, whereas names listed without
quotation marks are actual names given by the makers and printed on the vessels either from the collection or as reported in
print. A variety of abbreviations have been utilized in attributed pattern designations. “BAS” are pattern numbers given to
unidentified patterns by the Brazosport Archaeological Society, “S.U.F.,” “S.U.G.,” “S.U.O.,” and “S.U.S.” are pattern
numbers given to unidentified patterns by Williams and Weber (1986). The abbreviations stand for “Supplemental
Unascribed Floral,” “Supplemental Unascribed Genre,” “Supplemental Unascribed Oriental,” and “Supplemental
Unascribed Scenic.” “U.F.” and “U.S.” are pattern numbers given to unidentified patterns by Williams (1978). The
abbreviations stand for “Unascribed Floral” and “Unascribed Scenic."

vessel parts (Figure 3) are included. These figures are
extremely useful when using the Quintana catalogue,
both to aid in recognizing the type of vessel illustrated
and to assist researchers in identifying possible vessel
forms present in their own assemblages and collections.
DATING THE CERAMICS
FROM QUINTANA
Figure 4 graphically presents diagnostic attributes
of the transfer-printed patterns recovered at Quintana.
This graph is derived from a recent study by Patricia M.
Samford (1997:1–30). Samford’s work was based on a
substantial collection of marked transfer-printed ceramics
from which she was able to construct date ranges for a
variety of diagnostic decoration-related characteristics,
including style of central designs, style of border designs,
and colors. The date ranges she offers include both
absolute beginning and end dates as well as mean beginning and end production dates, which refer to the period
of greatest production and popularity. This unique study
provides a wealth of information that allows for tighter
and more accurate dating of ceramics than was previously possible. The date ranges given for patterns in this
catalogue are abstracted from Samford’s more complete
tables. When applicable, date ranges for colors, view style,
and/or border style are used to give more accurate dates
for the specimen in question.
Samford’s study was not the only dating tool applied
to ceramics from Quintana, however (Figure 5). The
primary guide for dating was the presence of makers’
marks, and in a few instances, importers’ marks. Makers’
marks allow for the identification of the specific manufacturer (especially important when more than one potter

is known to have made a pattern) and sometimes a location of manufacture, and they are usually indicative of a
time period based on the mark’s style. However, marks
for companies with long periods of production (such as
Davenport, ca. 1793–1887), are not precise reflections
of the potentially more-limited date ranges for a particular
pattern or vessel.
In addition to the information it can lend to dating,
the identification of manufacture is an important issue
in and of itself. When possible, the assignment of a maker
to a transfer-printed pattern has been made based on the
marks. However, such marks are not always present. In
such cases, published references on transfer-printed
patterns were consulted (see References Cited) to identify
unmarked patterns, and thus to compare specimens from
Quintana to complete (and hopefully marked) vessels.
Many of these published references focus on collecting
antique ceramics as opposed to identifying archeological
materials. Many of these books are extremely well
researched, but collector literature in general should be
used cautiously when applying to archeological collections. When multiple manufacturers produced the same
transfer-printed pattern, all known makers have been
considered as potentially associated with unmarked
patterns. When a transfer-printed pattern has been consistently marked by a single maker, that maker has been
listed as the most probable manufacturer for the example
from Quintana. However, it should be noted that, lacking a mark on the vessel or sherd in question, assignment of a maker to a particular transfer-printed pattern
has been made by comparative means only. The possibility remains that there are other unknown or previously unreported makers responsible for unmarked
transfer-printed vessels.

The Quintana Collection

Figure 3. Diagram of vessel parts.

In the Quintana collection, the ceramics studied
(with one exception) are all transfer printed on either
whiteware or white granite (ironstone) bodies. Since
whiteware was not common before ca. 1820 (Noël
Hume 1991:130), that date has been used as the terminus
post quem for the collection. White granite was not common until the late 1830s and greatly increased in use
during the 1840s and 1850s. It was available in a variety
of decorative styles, including transfer and flow printed
(Stoltzfus and Snyder 1997:11).
When attempting to assign a date range to a specific
vessel or pattern, a variety of factors were considered. As
with the Velasco catalogue, dates assigned here are as

specific to the vessel or sherds as possible. In each
instance, factors that dictated the summary date are
stated. It is the possibility of tight dating that makes
ceramics so useful in archeological contexts.
The dates for the Quintana collection provide an
insight into periods of activity as reflected in the use of
consumer goods in the nineteenth century, as well as
providing information about the rise, development, and
decline of Quintana as documented in archival resources.
Thus, this collection can serve as a case study of the usefulness of transfer-printed ceramics as indicators of
periods of activity on nineteenth-century sites in Texas.
There is no evidence of a time lag between availability of

pattern styles and their use at Quintana. However,
because only transfer-printed ceramics were analyzed,
the period of popularity, use, and production of these
wares limits the span of time that can be studied. In general, the popularity of the styles of transfer-printed wares
studied here declined beginning ca. 1860 and decreased
greatly by the end of the nineteenth century (Majewski
and O’Brien 1987:145–146), which effectively becomes
a terminal date for this study.
The decorative style of a majority of the Quintana
transfer-printed wares falls into one large, general
category that dominated the ceramics market from ca.
1820 until ca. 1870/1880. Although manufacturers
made frequent innovations in an effort to continually
maintain consumer interest and demand for transferprinted wares, many of the late-nineteenth- and earlytwentieth-century styles are not represented in the
Quintana collection. During most of the nineteenth
century, transfer-printed patterns were heavily decorative, covered a majority of the vessel, and were available

in a variety of colors, including multicolor combinations.
Many boasted finely engraved elaborate borders and
scenic views or landscapes popular during the Romantic
movement (Majewski and O’Brien 1987:143). By the
late nineteenth century, a new stylistic variety of “revival
transfer-printed” vessels was introduced. These wares
typically no longer featured scenic views, but instead were
decorated with more minimalist designs such as floral
motifs around vessel rims. Molding and gilding were
also commonly used in conjunction with late transfer
prints (Majewski and O’Brien 1987:145). In the
Quintana catalogue, the patterns Melissa, Melton, and
the “Unidentified Pattern” are good examples of latestyle transfer prints. Late transfer prints are present in
the Quintana collection—and therefore were historically
available and purchased by the residents of Quintana—
but in relatively small amounts. The reasons are not
entirely clear, but it could be a reflection of consumer
preference. It is possible that other ceramic wares were
being purchased instead: for example, molded white

Introduction

granite wares, which gained in popularity during the
second half of the nineteenth century, and decaldecorated ceramics, which superseded most transferprinted wares by the early twentieth century (Ewins
1997:32–33; Majewski and O’Brien 1987:146).
Based on the dated and identified patterns, use of
printed wares at Quintana began around 1820–1830,
peaked between 1830 and 1850, began to decline by
1850–1860, and was barely present after 1870, with only
occasional late examples dating to the 1890s. From 1810
to 1820, almost no activity in terms of the use of transferprinted ceramics is present. Of the few patterns identified to that period, many were probably heirlooms
brought to Quintana at a later date by families who
moved in to settle the area. The lack of transfer-printed
patterns from this decade corresponds well with the time
frame of Stephen F. Austin’s initial interest in the mouth
of the Brazos River, which did not occur until 1821. A
number of patterns date from 1820 to 1830, those years
representing the beginning of settlement efforts at
Quintana. Stephen F. Austin claimed land at the mouth
of the Brazos in 1824, and he continued throughout the
1820s to settle families in Texas. At this time, it is
probable that some ceramic vessels arrived as household
possessions.
Most of the patterns identified date between 1830
and 1850, suggesting this time frame as the period of
greatest acquisition and use of ceramics at Quintana. The
frequency of flow blue patterns corresponds well with
the general popularity of the ware. The first period of
popularity for flow blue was between the 1840s and
1850s, which is when flow blue and mulberry patterns
are most prevalent in the collection. They appear to have
maintained some popularity at Quintana from 1850 to
1860 after their appeal in the larger market had waned.
Flown patterns are in the minority during the remainder
of the study period, with an exception of a short revival
between 1890 and 1900, when flow blue again regained
its popularity (Samford 1997:24).
The years between 1836 and 1845 encompass the
era of the Republic of Texas. The period was also
disrupted by the worldwide economic Panic of 1837. At
the local level, Quintana experienced great change in
the 1830s and 1840s. Families and individuals slowly
moved into the area, and as they established themselves,
new or replacement teawares, tablewares, and toiletwares
would have been likely purchases. Life in the Texas
Republic period was “a mixture of the crude and the
cultivated,” and settlers often sought some sort of
comfort and refinement in the form of furnishings either
brought with them or purchased upon arrival to temper
the more rustic aspects of habitation (Hogan 1946:27).
For example, a description of Henry Austin’s (Stephen F.

17

Austin’s cousin) home on the Brazos noted that “New
York china was spread on the white board tables” (Hogan
1946:27). Presumably this refers to ceramics acquired
through a New York importer.
By the mid-1830s, commerce in the form of various
business partnerships was developing in Quintana,
resulting in the increased availability of ceramics and
access to market goods for consumers at all levels. One
example is Thomas F. McKinney’s warehouse, which
served as a point for exporting various plantation products and as a source of a variety of imported items, presumably including a stock of ceramics (Freeman 1998:6).
Schooners, sloops, and steamboats frequented the port
of the Brazos and would have ferried goods from
Galveston and New Orleans, as well as more distant ports.
Despite the turbulence of the times, confidence was
high and Quintana was thriving. With the birth of the
new Republic, Quintana boasted a hotel and Thomas
McKinney and Samuel Williams’s business house,
described as “the seat of an extensive foreign trade”
(Freeman 1998:7). Interest in the development of
Quintana as a town was great, though establishment of
a plat was slow in coming. In general, Quintana fit into
a trend of town development in coastal Texas of the
1830s, and 1834–1838 were boom years for the small
community.
However, prosperity was followed by a series of
misfortunes from 1839 to 1841. Perhaps one of the worst
for development was Quintana’s loss of the customhouse
to Velasco in 1839. Others included widespread sickness, a worm infestation in the cotton crop, flooding of
the Brazos River followed by drought, and a serious
financial depression due to the Panic of 1837. Although
to some the outlook was grim, development of amenities and transportation at Quintana crept forward
(Freeman 1998:13–18). The admission of Texas into the
United States in 1845 seems to have tempered the hard
times of the preceding few years. There is no indication
of change in consumer use or acquisition of transferprinted ceramics due to these economic undulations.
The period from 1842 to 1860 has been characterized as one of modest prosperity for Quintana. Interest
in development of transportation routes continued, the
population grew, and the economic health of the local
community was greatly aided by the activities of several
mercantile companies (Freeman 1998:25–39). This
stabilization of conditions correlated with the beginning
of a decline in transfer-printed ceramic use and purchase
from 1850 to 1860. By this time, many of the households were established, with no need for additional
transfer-printed teawares, tablewares, or toiletwares.
Those needs that did arise might have been met with the
purchase of molded white granite vessels, which were

18

The Quintana Collection

becoming increasingly popular.
There was a notable decline in use of transferprinted ceramics from 1860 to 1870. Undoubtedly, the
onset of the Civil War in 1861, with the subsequent
conflict and blockade along the Texas coast, did much
to limit market access. Post–Civil War Reconstruction
served to exacerbate the decline in consumer purchasing
power. Separate from any success, development, or
growth that Quintana might have experienced after the
Civil War, the popularity of transfer-printed ceramics was
on the decline within the consumer community at
Quintana and very few dating to 1870–1880 are in the
collection. After 1880, these wares virtually disappeared,
with the exception of a few late examples in the 1880 to
1890 period, when flow blue saw a second wave of popularity. Since the town of Quintana continued to grow
well into the twentieth century, other ceramic types, such
as decal-decorated vessels, must have been filling the
consumer need for table, tea, toilet, and kitchen wares.
Data presented by Collins (1990) are suggestive of a
rise in wares from American manufacturers in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
CERAMICS AND TRADE
Ceramics are extremely informative on the topics
of economics and trade. Although the Quintana collection is limited because of its lack of precise archeological
provenience, it still can offer data by virtue of the size of
the assemblage. Figure 5 summarizes the patterns
represented by known potters based on the ceramics in
the entire collection (not just the catalogue). Patterns
with unknown makers or potentially multiple makers
were eliminated. This graph offers a preliminary view of
which manufacturers were dominant in exporting wares
to Texas in the mid-nineteenth century. Unfortunately, it
was not possible to refine the data to the level of number
of vessels representing any one company. However, the
data are still useful in illustrating the extent to which
various makers were involved in the lucrative export
trade.
Although the Quintana catalogue features transferprinted ceramics, this decorative type does not represent the ceramics collection from Quintana as a whole,
nor do the discussions specifically focused on transfer
prints address the rest of the collection. Residents of
Quintana throughout the nineteenth century utilized a
wide variety of tea, table, toilet, and kitchen ware types.
These include whitewares with other decorations such
as hand painting, shell edge, sponge, spatter, and annular
motifs. Molded white granite and copper luster tea leaf
wares are also present in large quantities. Yellowwares,
stonewares (both refined and utilitarian), and utilitarian

red earthenwares also occupy significant portions of the
collection and are actually more representative of wares
used by average people. In contrast, transfer-printed
ceramics occupied a much higher level of social status
and economic expenditure (Miller 1980, 1991). Each
of these ceramics categories has an important history
of its own. When considered together they present a
more comprehensive picture of the British (and later
American) ceramics industry, the ceramics export trade,
consumerism, foodways, and lifeways. Unfortunately,
such large-scale discussions are beyond the scope of this
work.
All the transfer-printed ceramics in this study are
from Great Britain, primarily from the Staffordshire
District in the English Midlands (Figure 6). However,
examples from Liverpool, Sunderland, and Newcastleupon-Tyne in England, and Swansea in Wales were also
recovered (Table 2).
Due to technological innovations and other factors,
British pottery manufacturers dominated the worldwide
ceramics trade from the late eighteenth century to the
late nineteenth century (Noël Hume 1991:122). The
ceramics from Quintana illustrate this fact well. Based
on all identified patterns (not just those in the catalogue)
that could be linked to individual manufacturers, three
companies appear to dominate. They are William Adams
& Sons, Enoch Wood & Sons, and Davenport. The large
size of these companies and extensive nature of their
individual export networks made them leading suppliers
of ceramics to the American markets. Each company also
made efforts to specifically address American needs and
tastes.
William Adams & Sons
William Adams & Sons was a large pottery operated by a family with a long history in ceramic manufacture in the Staffordshire District. The lineage was established in 1657, and by the late eighteenth century and
into the mid to late nineteenth century, there were four
potters from the Adams family, all with the first name of
William, who were active in the business (Larsen
1975:141–152). William Adams of Stoke-on-Trent
produced wares out of the Cliff Bank Works. In 1819 he
was joined in the business by his sons and became William
Adams & Sons, the company whose ceramics are represented in the Quintana collection. After the death of the
senior William Adams, operations moved to a location
in Tunstall.
William Adams & Sons had an important export
trade and produced wares that were shipped to the
United States (including American views), Central
America, Brazil, Cuba, Manila, Singapore, and other

Introduction

Wetherbee [1985:11]).

foreign markets (Snyder 1995:39–41). The company had
offices in New York (opened in 1821) and Mexico
(opened in 1830) to further encourage their export network (Coysh 1972:10–13). The transfer-printed patterns
made by William Adams & Sons recovered at Quintana
date from the Mexican period, the Republic of Texas,

early statehood, and into the Civil War period, thus
demonstrating the efficacy and success of the firm’s
export trade network. The pottery was taken over by
Josiah Wedgwood & Sons in 1966 and is now part of
the Wedgewood group of companies (Goodby, personal
communication 1998).

Enoch Wood & Sons
Enoch Wood & Sons of Burslem also grew out of
an established Staffordshire potting family. The senior
Enoch Wood has been called the “Father of the
Potteries” (Coysh and Henrywood 1982:408). He was
also one of the first notable collectors of British pottery.
Much to the benefit of modern collectors and scholars,
Wood was known to place caches of his ceramics (made
by both Enoch Wood and Enoch Wood & Sons) in the
foundations of buildings in Burslem. When discovered—
such as the 300 pieces found in St. Paul’s Church in
1974—these deposits have done much to further the
study of the company’s products (Kingsbury 1977:122–
127).
In 1818, Wood was joined by his three sons, and
changed the company name to Enoch Wood & Sons. It
continued as such until 1846. By 1820, the company
had become one of the largest and most prominent
potteries in Staffordshire, exporting vast amounts of
transfer-printed wares. A single shipment from Enoch
Wood & Sons to a dealer in Philadelphia in 1834 was
documented as having 262,000 pieces (Coysh and
Henrywood 1982:408). The company was best known
for its deep blue wares and for its various scenic series
with a different view on each piece, a marketing technique employed by many potteries that dealt with the
American export market. Enoch Wood & Sons produced

more historical American views than any other company,
as well as at least 80 different British views, various
European views (especially French), and Canadian, Asian,
and African views, all of which were sold in great quantities in the American market (Collard 1984:201–208;
Coysh 1972:96–97; Larsen 1975:7–42).
Davenport
Davenport of Longport was also a large Staffordshire
manufacturer with a long tradition in the pottery
industry. The company went through periods of control
by different members of the family, prompting accompanying name changes until its closure in 1887. However, the wares they produced were only marked with
the surname of Davenport, limiting the utility of those
name changes in dating specimens.
John Davenport established his pottery in 1794,
and his early years were successful ones. Davenport was
manufacturing earthenwares and porcelains, and in 1801
he made an unusual expansion into the production of
glassware. The year 1806 was an especially proud one
for the company: it was toured by the Prince of Wales,
who ordered several services to be made (Lockett
1972:10). The company was honored by the Royal family
again with an order for a porcelain dessert service to be
used at the Coronation Banquet of William IV in 1830
(Lockett 1972:78).

Introduction

Davenport put great effort into expanding the
company’s markets at home and abroad. There was a
showroom in London and a warehouse and salesroom
in Liverpool. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars in
1815, Davenport renewed efforts to market wares in
Europe, including proposed sales in St. Petersburg, Spain,
and France, a warehouse in Hamburg, and agents in
Messina (Sicily) and Brussels (Lockett 1972:18–19).
By ca. 1817, John’s son Henry had joined the firm,
to be followed later by younger sibling William in 1832,
who in turn took over the business with Henry’s death
in 1835 (Lockett 1972:12–18). A majority of the wares
recovered from Quintana were made during the period
of manufacture under Henry and then William.
Davenport’s pursuit of foreign markets paid off.
Sales were being made to Canada, South America
(including Rio de Janiero, Brazil and Lima, Peru), and
the East Indies in the 1820s (Lockett 1972:19). However, access to one of the largest and most lucrative
markets, the United States, did not come until 1831. At
that time, the firm of Hill and Henderson of New Orleans
became Davenport’s sole importer and distributor for
the U.S. market. Hill and Henderson (1822–1834), and
the later partnerships of Henderson, Walton & Co.
(1834–1836) and Henderson and Gaines (1836–1866),
specialized in importing ceramics, glass, and other wares
for sale in what was termed the “country trade”—rural
and foreign markets. Importers’ marks from these partnerships have been recovered on ceramics from Quintana

21

and Velasco, as well as locations in west Texas and
California (Black and Brandimarte 1987:1–3; Pollan et
al. 1996:10; Praetzellis et al. 1983:30). The business
relationship between Davenport and Henderson and Hill
was profitable because New Orleans served as a major
source of supplies to Texas and beyond in the mid nineteenth century (Silverthorne 1986).
ORGANIZATION OF THE CATALOGUE
Catalogue entries are organized alphabetically by
pattern name, and BAS-numbered patterns follow at the
end. Each pattern entry features a photograph or
photographs of diagnostic elements. The illustrations
vary in content. Some have a single sherd, some multiple individual sherds, and some partially crossmended
vessel(s). When possible, close-up views of marks (maker,
importer, and/or pattern) are presented. The title section
always includes the pattern name, maker, and date range
for the specific example presented. The text always
includes information on border, pattern, view, marks,
vessel form and size, color illustrated, colors recovered,
maker, importer, summary date, and references specific
to that pattern.
A section of color plates is provided in the middle
of this volume. It is designed to illustrate the different
colors and varying shades noted among the transfer prints
recovered. The main body of the catalogue is followed
by a glossary, references cited, and an index.

PATTERNS

ABBEY RUINS

25

ABBEY RUINS
Thomas Mayer, 1836–1838
The border has floral designs alternating with a distinctive ewer. The pattern, Abbey Ruins, has several possible
different central views, one of which is shown. Note the ruins in the background and two people and several animals
in the foreground. Most of the printed maker and pattern mark was recovered. The vessel shown is an 11-inch plate
printed in blue. This pattern was only recovered in blue. The maker is Thomas Mayer, who commonly used variations
of this mark on transfer-printed wares. The importer is unknown. The location of Mayer at Longport, indicated on
the mark, was only used from 1836 to 1838, making that the summary date.

AGRICULTURAL VASE

AGRICULTURAL VASE (see Color Plate 4)
Ridgway, Morley, Wear & Co., 1836–1842
This border pattern has small sprigs and flowers and the same string element used as both the edge pattern and the
well wreath. This pattern, Agricultural Vase, has a single view featuring the prominent vase. Although several potters
produced Agricultural Vase, a printed maker and pattern mark was recovered, providing more specific information.
An impressed tally mark is also present. The vessels illustrated are a 6¼-inch saucer and a cup printed in blue. This
pattern was recovered in blue, brown, and red. The mark indicates the Ridgway, Morley, Wear & Co. partnership as
the manufacturer. The importer is unknown. Based on the maker, the summary date is 1836–1842.

AMARYLLIS

27

AMARYLLIS
Joseph Heath & Co., 1828–1841
The border consists of alternating floral reserves separated by sections of filled bands and is finished with a well
wreath. This pattern, Amaryllis, has a view that is a central floral motif. A garter-style printed maker-and-pattern mark
was recovered (not reproducible). The indeterminate flatware form of unknown size shown is printed in blue and
purple, the only colors recovered. Although other potters made Amaryllis, the mark indicates that this example was
made by Joseph Heath & Co. The importer is unknown. Based on the maker, the summary date is 1828–1841.

AMOY

AMOY (see Color Plate 3)
Davenport, 1844
The elements of the border include two different floral and scroll groupings alternating around the marly. This
chinoiserie pattern, Amoy, has a single view showing two Chinese figures under an umbrella next to a fence, some
trees, and oversized flowers. A printed maker-and-pattern mark and an impressed-and-dated maker’s mark are present
on the back of this 10½-inch plate. Amoy is printed in flow blue, the only color recovered for this pattern. As
indicated by the marks, this example was made by Davenport, although the importer is unknown. The Davenport
anchor mark gives 1844 as the date of manufacture.

ANTELOPE

ANTELOPE
Job & John Jackson, 1831–1835
Distinguishing features of the border are crosshatching, arches, and curlicues. This pattern, Antelope, has a view
showing a girl and an antelope. No marks were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from an indeterminate hollowware
form of unknown size; a badly eroded 2¼-inch-tall child’s cup was also recovered. The color illustrated is black, and
the cup is printed in purple. The pattern was probably manufactured by Job and John Jackson. They were in business
from 1831 to 1835, thus designating the summary date for this pattern.
References: Godden 1964:349; Snyder 1997:81; Williams and Weber 1986:332.

ARCADIA

31

ARCADIA
possibly J. & M. P. Bell & Co., ca. 1831–1851
This romantic-style transfer print is distinguished by its worm-track border, which is finished with a lacelike string
element. This pattern, Arcadia, has a view with figures and trees in the foreground, a waterway in the center, and
buildings in the background, a common type of idealized romantic scene. No marks were recovered. The sherds
illustrated are from an indeterminate hollowware form of unknown size printed in blue. No other colors were recovered.
The maker is unconfirmed. It is known that J. & M. P. Bell & Co. (1842–1928) made a pattern called Arcadia, but
it is not known if it is this exact pattern. The importer is unknown. Romantic-style transfer prints were most popular
ca. 1831–1851, making that the most likely summary date.

32

ARCHERY

ARCHERY (see Color Plate 1)
Herculaneum Pottery, ca. 1825–1841
The border is primarily floral, and the well wreath consists of a distinctive ribbon with occasional groups of archery
equipment, such as targets and arrows. This pattern, Archery, has several possible views, all of which feature people
engaging in the sport of archery. No marks were recovered. The vessel illustrated is an oval platter of unknown size,
printed in black. No other colors were recovered. This pattern was probably manufactured by the Herculaneum
Pottery (ca. 1793–1841). The importer is unknown. Based on a mean beginning production date of ca. 1825 for
black printing and the end production date of 1841 for the probable maker, the summary date is ca. 1825–841.

ASIATIC PLANTS

33

ASIATIC PLANTS (see Color Plate 10)
unknown maker, ca. 1829–1849
The border has very distinctive characteristics, and a majority of the elements are shown. Note especially the highly
ornate well wreath. This pattern, Asiatic Plants, features a view of a spray of flowers. No marks were recovered. The
vessel illustrated is a cup plate of unknown size printed in red. No other colors were recovered. The maker(s) and
importer of this pattern are not known. Current research on transfer-printed wares indicates that central floral motifs
were most popular and primarily produced between 1833 and 1849. Therefore, based on a mean beginning production
date of ca. 1829 for red printing and the style, the summary date is ca. 1829–1849.

34

ATHENS

ATHENS (see Color Plate 1)
William Adams & Sons, ca. 1849–1858
The main elements of the border for this pattern are classical buildings surrounded by stylized flowers and a distinctive
well wreath. This pattern, Athens, has a view featuring buildings with columns, along with a large fountain in the
foreground. Partial printed pattern, maker, patent, and registry marks were recovered. An impressed tally mark is also
present. The vessels illustrated include portions of an indeterminate flatware form (all sherds, this page), a hollowware
serving vessel lid (facing page, top), and a large pitcher (facing page, bottom), all of unknown sizes. All examples are
printed in flow mulberry, the only color recovered. As the mark indicates, the maker is William Adams & Sons (1819–
1966). The importer is unknown. Based on the pattern registry date of 1849 and the period of popularity for flow
mulberry between 1841 and 1858, the summary date is ca. 1849 to 1858.

“BEEHIVE AND VASES”

“BEEHIVE AND VASES”
Ralph Stevenson & Williams, ca. 1825
This is an attributed name commonly used in published references. The border has leafy scrolls and a fish-roe type
background. The maker’s name for this pattern is not known. The main design elements of the view are vases and a
central beehive. No marks were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from an indetermiante hollowware form of
unknown size printed in deep blue, the only color recovered. The short-lived partnership of Ralph Stevenson &
Williams is known to have made this pattern, dating it to ca. 1825.

BELZONI

37

BELZONI
Enoch Wood & Sons, ca. 1827–1846
The border features groups of flowers and grapes alternating with scenic reserves. This pattern, Belzoni, has views
that vary but are dominated by exotic horse-mounted figures in eastern dress, sometimes hunting ostriches. No marks
were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from a saucer and possible pitcher, both of unknown size, and are printed
in blue. Other examples from Quintana are printed in red and purple. Enoch Wood & Sons (1818–1846) is known to
have made this pattern. The importer is unknown. Based on the mean beginning production date of ca. 1827 for
purple printing and the end production date for the probable maker, the summary date is ca. 1827–1846.

BOUQUET

BOUQUET
Knight Elkin & Co., 1826–1846
This single marly sherd was identified by comparison with a marked vessel from a private collection rather than using
published references. Because photographs of the pattern and mark are not available in commonly referenced works,
one is provided here. The border has an intertwining floral motif with occasional Chinese figures. This pattern,
Bouquet, has a view that consists of a large vase of flowers. No marks were recovered. The sherd illustrated is from an
indeterminate flatware form of unknown size printed in brown, the only color recovered. This pattern was made by
Knight Elkin & Co. (1826–1846), but the importer is unknown. Based on the maker, the summary date is 1826–
1846.

“BRUSHSTROKE”

“BRUSHSTROKE”
various makers, ca. 1840s–1850s
“Brushstroke” is an attributed name given in several published sources to indicate that this is a hand-painted flow
blue design rather than a transfer-printed one. It is included here to serve as a reminder that flow blue wares occur
with this type of decoration as well. The border has a simple, stylized floral motif. Any pattern name assigned by
manufacturers is unknown. The view also has a stylized floral motif, but designs can vary widely due to their handpainted nature. No marks were recovered. Sherds illustrated are from indeterminate hollowware and flatware forms
of unknown size. All of the examples are flow blue. Various makers produced hand-painted flow blue wares, including
Charles Allerton & Sons (1859–1942), Edward Walley (1845–1856), Doulton & Co. (1882–1973), William Ridgway
& Co. (ca. 1830–1854), as well as other unknown makers. The importer is unknown. Flow blue was most popular
from ca. the 1840s to the 1850s, making that the most likely summary date.

BURMESE

41

BURMESE
Mellor, Venables & Co., 1834–1851
The defining element of the border is the elephant featured in the reserves. Note also the floral well wreath. This
exotic pattern, Burmese, also features an elephant in the foreground of the view. No marks were recovered. These
sherds are from an indetermiante flatware form of unknown size printed in blue, the only color recovered. This
pattern was probably manufactured by Mellor, Venables & Co. (1834–1851). The importer is unknown. Based on
the probable maker, the summary date is 1834 to 1851.

CALEDONIAN

CALEDONIAN
Ridgway, Morley, Wear & Co., 1836–1842
The border has a plaid-style design. This pattern, Caledonian, has a view that includes only an elaborate central
medallion design. A printed maker-and-pattern mark was recovered. The sherd illustrated is from an indetermiante
flatware form of unknown size, printed in green, the only color recovered. As indicated on the mark, the maker is
Ridgway, Morley, Wear & Co. (1836–1842). The importer is unknown. Based on the maker, the summary date is
1836–1842.

CANTON

43

CANTON
James Edwards, ca. 1842–1851
Many standard transfer-printed patterns produced by different potters had the same name but were entirely different
patterns. However, this particular (and exact same) flow blue pattern was made by several different potters, but given
different names. It is a chinoiserie-style design with both border and well wreath set off by dagger shapes. This
pattern, Canton, has a view with a central medallion that is also surrounded by dagger shapes. A black printed Royal
Arms maker’s mark and an impressed “WARRANTED” mark were recovered. The vessel shown is a 6-inch saucer
printed in flow blue, the only color recovered. The maker is James Edwards (ca. 1842–1851), but the importer is
unknown. Based on the maker, the summary date is ca. 1842–1851.
References: Godden 1964:230; Snyder 1994:54.

44

CHINESE

CHINESE
Thomas Dimmock & Co., ca. 1840–1859
The border is comprised of alternating reserves, each with a lotus-style flower. This pattern, Chinese, has a view with
typical chinoiserie landscape elements: a pagoda, an orange tree, a small sampan, figures in Asian dress, and Chippendale
fencing. No marks were recovered. The sherd illustrated is from an indeterminate hollowware form of unknown size
printed in flow blue, the only color recovered. Several companies made flow blue patterns called Chinese, but this
specific one was most probably made by Thomas Dimmock & Co. (1828 to 1859). The importer is unknown. Based
on the initial period of popularity for flow blue beginning in ca. 1840 and the maker’s end production date, the
summary date is ca. 1840–1859.
References: Gaston 1983:24; Godden 1964:208; Samford 1997:7–9, 17, 24; Snyder 1994:81; Williams 1995:18.

CHINESE PASTIME

45

CHINESE PASTIME (see Color Plate 7)
Davenport, ca. 1836–1866
This pattern is copiously illustrated in the Velasco catalogue with photographs of three different central views, maker’s
marks, importer’s marks, and a color plate of the pattern in purple. The pattern is included again here to illustrate the
distinctive green color used by Davenport (see color plate). The border is primarily floral with scrolls. This pattern,
Chinese Pastime, has several views. This view was given the attributed name “Hoop & Pinwheel” in the Velasco
catalogue. A printed maker-and-pattern mark, a printed importer’s mark, and a partial impressed-and-dated maker’s
mark were all recovered. The vessel illustrated is a 10-inch plate printed in green. Sherds were also found printed in
black, brown, purple, and blue. The maker is Davenport (ca. 1793–1887), and the importer is Henderson & Gaines
of New Orleans (1836–1866). The impressed mark bears the last digit of a date—a “6”—indicating that this example
was made in one of four possible years: 1836, 1846, 1856, or 1866.

CHINESE PLANT

CHINESE PLANT
unidentified maker, ca. 1839–1856
This geometric border is interrupted by floral reserves. This chinoiserie pattern, Chinese Plant, has a view that
features a group of exotic flowers. No marks were recovered. The vessel illustrated is a cup of unidentified size printed
in flow blue, the only color recovered. Published examples of this pattern are marked by an unidentified maker
(initials E. W.). The importer is also unidentified. Based on the popularity of flow blue chinoiserie floral patterns, the
summary date is ca. 1839–1856.

CLYDE
SCENERY
Job & John Jackson, 1831–1835
The border features reserves of flowers and scrolls alternating with scenic vignettes of boats and buildings. Note
especially the diagnostic string elements at the rim and well wreath. This pattern, Clyde Scenery, has a wide variety of
different possible views, but all share similar characteristics. All have figures in the foreground and all have castle-type
buildings in the background. A portion of a printed pattern mark was recovered. Sherds illustrated are from an
indeterminate flatware form of unknown size printed in purple, the only color recovered. This is most probably a
product of Job & John Jackson (1831–1835). The importer is unknown. Based on the probable maker, the summary
date is 1831–1835.

COLUMBIA

COLUMBIA
William Adams & Sons, ca. 1842–1858
The border consists of concentric lines with continuous scrolls and groups of flowers. This pattern, Columbia, has
views that vary, but all feature large gothic buildings and strolling figures. No marks were recovered. The sherd
illustrated is from an indeterminate flatware form of unknown size, printed in blue, the only color recovered. William
Adams & Sons (1819–1966) is known to have produced this pattern, making that company the probable maker. The
importer is unknown. Based on the period of popularity for linear style borders, the summary date is ca. 1842–1858.

COLUMBIAN STAR

49

COLUMBIAN STAR
John Ridgway, ca. 1840
The border features large stars set on a field of smaller stars. This pattern, Columbian Star, was designed to commemorate
William Henry Harrison’s 1840 presidential campaign. Harrison won the election but died a month after entering
office. Three different views are possible, with only minor variations between them. Each shows a log cabin from a
different perspective, and one has the addition of horses and a man plowing in the foreground. No marks were
recovered. The sherd illustrated is from an indeterminate hollowware form of unknown size printed in blue, the only
color recovered. The probable maker is John Ridgway (ca. 1830–1841), but the importer is unknown. Due to the
historical association, the summary date is ca. 1840.

50

CORAL BORDER

CORAL BORDER
multiple makers, ca. 1829–1859
The border has highly stylized flowers surrounded by coral-like designs. Although this pattern is called Coral Border,
it has a border and single view that always go together. The view consists of highly stylized flowers. No marks were
recovered. The sherds illustrated are from a London-shape cup, a saucer, and an indeterminate flatware form, all of
unknown size. The colors illustrated are blue and green, and red was also recovered. Coral Border was produced by
three different potters: Thomas Dimmock (ca. 1828–1859), Goodwins & Harris (1831–1838), and Pountney &
Goldney (1836–1849); any of these could be the maker of the examples recovered from Quintana. The importer is
unknown. Based on the mean beginning production date of ca. 1829 for red printing and the production date ranges
for the possible makers, the summary date is ca. 1829–1859.

CYRENE

51

CYRENE
William Adams & Sons, ca. 1820–1864
The border primarily consists of a crosshatched design periodically interrupted by reserves featuring buildings. This
romantic-style pattern, Cyrene, has a view that varies somewhat but always includes towers in the background and
sitting and standing figures in the foreground. A published Cyrene maker’s mark recovered from Quintana and
reported by Collins (1990) is no longer available for examination due to loss during a previous study. The vessel
illustrated is a 6¼-inch whiteware saucer printed in blue, the only color recovered. The maker is William Adams &
Sons (1819–1966), but the importer is unknown. Based on whiteware coming into common use by ca. 1820 and the
cartouche-style of mark with pattern and maker’s name used by Adams & Sons until 1864, the summary date is ca.
1820–1864.

52

“DAGGER-BORDER CHINOISERIE”

“DAGGER-BORDER CHINOISERIE”
Enoch Wood & Sons, ca. 1820–1830
This name is an attributed one commonly used in print by collectors. The border has a crosshatched outer band, as
well as a central dagger band. The pattern name is unknown. The view has pagodas, a bridge, and two figures. No
marks were recovered. The sherd illustrated is from an indeterminate flatware form of unknown size. The pattern is
printed on whiteware in blue, the only color recovered. This pattern was probably made by Enoch Wood & Sons
(1818–1846). The importer is unknown. Published examples of this pattern date no later than ca. 1830. Therefore,
considering the fact that whiteware came into common use by ca. 1820, the summary date is ca. 1820–1830.

“DAVENPORT III”

53

“DAVENPORT III”
Davenport, ca. 1834–1866
This is an attributed name commonly used in published references. It is well illustrated in the Velasco catalogue with
a partially reconstructed pitcher, two close-ups of the border pattern, and a color photograph. It is included here to
show a mark and a central scene not previously illustrated. The border has flowers and reserves with birds. Note also
the scene frame string element of buds. The pattern name is unknown. A variety of views is possible, including this
one with a woman in the foreground. An impressed maker’s mark and small portion of an importer’s mark (not
pictured) were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from an indeterminate flatware form of unknown size printed in
brown, the only color recovered. The maker is Davenport (ca. 1793–1887), and the importer is either Henderson,
Walton & Co. (1834–1836) or the Henderson & Gaines (1836–1866) partnership from New Orleans. Based on the
importer, the summary date is ca. 1834–1866.

54

DELPHI

DELPHI
William Adams & Sons, ca. 1820–1864
The border is highly ornate, consisting primarily of stylized scrolls, reserves, and flowers. Note also the string element
around the rim and the distinctive well wreath. This pattern, Delphi, has a view that may vary but always includes
prominent ruins of a cathedral-like building with figures in the foreground and mountains in the far distance. No
marks were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from a plate of unknown size printed on whiteware in blue, the only
color recovered. This pattern was probably made by William Adams & Sons (1769–1966), but the importer is
unknown. Published examples exhibit a mark that the company used from 1810 to 1864. Considering those dates,
along with the common use of whiteware by ca. 1820, the summary date is ca. 1820–1864.

DR. FRANKLIN’S MAXIMS

55

DR. FRANKLIN’S MAXIMS
multiple makers, ca. 1829–1880
The primary focus of this pattern is a series of sayings or mottoes by Benjamin Franklin gathered under the overall
theme of Poor Richard’s Way to Wealth. The morals, often intended for children, were paired with a border that has
a distinctive single triangular design at the rim and foot framing the title, with the saying surrounding its accompanying
scene. For this pattern, Dr. Franklin’s Maxims, each distinct maxim has a particular vignette with which it is associated.
The exact rendering of the view (and sometimes the view itself) varies from maker to maker. Three different examples
of Dr. Franklin’s Maxim’s were recovered. The first example (top) reads, “Handle your tools without mittens; Remember
the cat in gloves catches nothing.” This view features men with shovels and picks digging a hole. The second view
(middle) is, “By diligence and perseverance the mouse eats the cable in two. Diligence is the mother of good luck and
God gives all things to industry.” A man is shown chopping down a tree, and there are various objects in the foreground.
The final maxim (bottom) warns, “Not to oversee workmen is to leave them your purse open.” This view features
three men availing themselves of the contents of barrels in a warehouse. No marks were recovered. All vessels illustrated
are mugs of unknown size, and all are printed in brown, the only color recovered. Many potters produced this
pattern, including J. & G. Meakin (1851–present), William Adams (1769–1966), and other unknown manufacturers.
The importer is unknown. Based on the mean beginning production date of ca. 1829 for brown printing and the time
of general decline in this style of transfer prints, the summary date is ca. 1829–1880.

56

“E IS THE ENGINE”

“E IS THE ENGINE” (see Color Plate 8)
multiple makers, ca. 1830–1850
The name of this pattern is an attributed one taken from the verse on the vessel itself. There is no border, and transfer
prints of this sort did not usually have pattern names. This particular example embraces two important traditions in
decoration: alphabet mugs and plates and railway commemoratives. Designed for children, alphabet mugs and plates
featured anything from a single letter to the entire alphabet and were accompanied by scenes. Often an initial letter
served as the beginning of a verse, with the object as illustration. This view reads, “E Is the ENGINE, all puffing and
smoke, That daily is fed with some bushels of coke.” This particular example is also very much in the style of railway
commemorative wares, with its named locomotive engine, Mazeppa. The innovation in transportation offered by the
railroad had an important impact both in England and America. No marks were recovered. The vessel illustrated is a
25/8-inch-tall mug printed in green, the only color recovered. Both alphabet mugs and railway wares were made by a
variety of potters, including William Adams (1769–1966), Charles Allerton & Sons (1859–1942), Anthony Shaw &
Son (ca. 1860–1900), Enoch Wood & Sons (1818–1846), Don Pottery (1790–1893), Herculaneum Pottery (ca.
1793–1841), Minton (1793–present), John & Robert Godwin (1834–1866), Beardmore & Edwards (ca. 1856–
1858), and other unknown makers. The importer is unknown. Based on the mean beginning production date of ca.
1830 for green printing and the period of popularity of railroad commemoratives (primarily ca. 1830–1850), the
summary date is ca. 1830–1850.

EASTERN SCENERY “II”

57

EASTERN SCENERY “II”
Enoch Wood & Sons, ca. 1820–1846
Enoch Wood & Sons made two entirely different patterns that they called Eastern Scenery. The “II” is an attributed
designation to distinguish one pattern from the other. The border consists of swags of net drapery, from which hang
both small ball-like tassels and delicate strings of beads. Flowers of various sorts are incorporated into the border. This
pattern, Eastern Scenery “II,” has views that vary but always incorporate a large gothic building and figures. No
marks were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from an indeterminate hollowware form of unknown size printed on
whiteware in blue, the only color recovered. This pattern was most probably made by Enoch Wood & Sons (ca.
1818–1846). The importer is unknown. Based on the common use of whiteware by ca. 1820 and the probable maker,
the summary date is ca. 1820–1846.

58

ETRUSCAN VASE

ETRUSCAN VASE
Enoch Wood & Sons, ca. 1825–1846
The border consists of stylized scrolls set against stippling. Note also the string element of bars and rosettes. This
classical-style pattern, Etruscan Vase, has a view with a large classical vase or urn on an ornate base. The background
has sailboats and mountains. No marks were recovered. Sherds illustrated are from a saucer and London-shape cup of
unknown size printed in black, the only color recovered. This pattern was probably made by Enoch Wood & Sons
(ca. 1818–1846). The importer is unknown. Based on the mean beginning production date of ca. 1825 for black
printing and the end production date for the probable maker, the summary date is ca. 1825–1846.

EUPHRATES

59

EUPHRATES
William Ridgway, ca. 1830–1834
The border has a field of mossy designs interrupted with scenic reserves. This exotic pattern, Euphrates, has a view
featuring a man mounted on a camel and two figures on foot, along with buildings on both sides and a river running
through the middle of the scene. Partial printed pattern and impressed maker’s marks were recovered. The sherd
illustrated is from an indeterminate flatware form of unknown size printed in blue, the only color recovered. This
pattern was made by William Ridgway (ca. 1830–1834). The importer is unknown. Based on the maker, the summary date is ca. 1830–1834.

60

EXCELSIOR

EXCELSIOR
Thomas Fell & Co., ca. 1849–1863
The border has a dark background with a light geometric design running around the circumference. This pattern,
Excelsior, has a view that features ruins, figures in the foreground, and a central waterway. A printed maker and
pattern mark was recovered. The vessels illustrated are a 3-inch-tall cup and a 6¼-inch saucer printed in flow blue, the
only color recovered. This pattern was made by Thomas Fell & Co. (ca. 1830–1890). The importer is unknown.
Based on the mean beginning and end production dates for romantic-style flow blue patterns, the summary date is ca.
1849–1863.

FLORILLA

FLORILLA (see Color Plate 10)
Edward Challinor, 1842–1867
The border has scrolls and flowers. This pattern, Florilla, is primarily a chinoiserie pattern in that its view consists of
a pagoda, a vase of flowers, and a pheasant. A printed pattern mark was recovered. The sherd illustrated is from an
indeterminate flatware form of unknown size. It is printed in purple with blue, red, and green clobbering, the only
color combination recovered. This version of Florilla is known to have been made by Edward Challinor (1842–
1867). The importer is unknown. Based on the probable maker, the summary date is 1842–1867.
References: Godden 1964:137; Samford 1997:22; Williams 1978:628.

FLOSCULOUS

63

FLOSCULOUS
William Ridgway & Co., 1834–1854
This pattern does not have a distinct border. Instead, Flosculus is a cohesive pattern that covers the entire surface of
the vessel (although not a continuous sheet pattern). Therefore, there is no separate view. The center of the pattern
focuses on a scroll shape with three radiating arms. Sprigs of stylized flowers radiate from that center design to fill the
rest of the area. A printed maker-and-pattern mark was recovered. The sherds illustrated are from an indeterminate
flatware form of unknown size printed in brown, the only color recovered. This pattern was made by William Ridgway
& Co. (1834–1854). The importer is unknown. Based on the maker, the summary date is 1834–1854.

FRANKLIN’S MORALS

FRANKLIN’S MORALS
Davenport, ca. 1820–1835
This series of plates featuring sayings by Benjamin Franklin is well illustrated in the Velasco catalogue. A partially
reconstructed plate, maker’s and importer’s marks, and a color photograph carry the motto “Many a Little Makes a
Mickle.” However, a view not previously illustrated is included in this collection. The series is defined as such by its
border, which has an ornate arrangement of scrolls, fruit, and flowers, and an especially elaborate scene frame. This
pattern, Franklin’s Morals, has sherds from Quintana with the view No Gains Without Pains. It shows a boy holding
a tree he is about to plant, with a shovel at his side and a watering can at his feet. A printed pattern-and-view mark was
recovered. The sherds illustrated are from an indeterminate flatware form of unknown size printed on whiteware in
deep blue, the only color recovered. This pattern was probably made by Davenport (ca. 1793–1887), but the importer was not indicated. Based on the common use of whiteware by ca. 1820 and the mean end production date of
ca. 1835 for deep blue transfer prints, the summary date is ca. 1820–1835.

FRIBURG

65

FRIBURG
multiple makers, ca. 1842–1858
The border is a concentric linear type, with vines, clusters of flowers, and vertical bands. This pattern, Friburg, has
views that vary but typically feature a large and rather ornate gothic building akin to a chalet. No marks were
recovered. The sherds illustrated are from an indeterminate flatware form of unknown size printed in blue, the only
color recovered. Both Davenport (ca. 1793–1887) and George Phillips (1834–1848) made this pattern, and either
could be responsible for this example from Quintana. The importer is unknown. Based on the period of popularity for
linear-style borders, the most likely summary date, regardless of manufacturer, is ca. 1842–1858.

GIRAFFE

GIRAFFE
John Ridgway, ca. 1836–1841
Based on published examples, two different borders were employed, one on tablewares and one on teawares. The
border recovered consists of an angular edge pattern enclosing a crosshatched design, which is finished with scrolls
and set with flowers. This pattern, Giraffe, has one view used with either border. It features a group of three giraffes
with two handlers in eastern garb next to them. Tents are in the background. Portions of a printed publication mark
were recovered. The full mark provides the pattern name, maker, and the phrase “Published August 30th 1836
Agreeably to the Act.” Such a publication date should be considered a beginning date for the pattern. The sherds
illustrated are from an indeterminate flatware form of unknown size printed in purple, the only color recovered. This
pattern was made by John Ridgway (ca. 1830–1841), but the importer is unknown. Based on the publication date
and the maker, the summary date is ca. 1836–1841.

GRECIAN FONT

67

GRECIAN FONT
William Adams & Sons, ca. 1827–1864
The border consists of a triangular leafy design alternating with two different scalloped semicircular designs. For this
pattern, Grecian Font, only border sherds were identified from Quintana. Only one published example of this pattern
was located, so it is not known if alternate views exist. The single example features a large fountain and three women.
No marks were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from a saucer of unknown size printed in purple, the only color
recovered. This pattern was probably made by William Adams & Sons (1819–1966), and published examples bear a
mark used from 1800 to 1864. The importer is unknown. Based on the mean beginning production age of ca. 1827
for purple printing and the published mark, the summary date is ca. 1827–1864.

GRECIAN SCENERY

GRECIAN SCENERY
Enoch Wood & Sons, ca. 1820–1846
The border is simply a loose wreath of flowers. The edge pattern has distinctive dagger shapes that complement the
molded gadroon edge of the whiteware vessel on which it is printed. The scene frame is reminiscent of a folded
ribbon. As implied by the name of this pattern, Grecian Scenery, a variety of views was available. The views vary but
typically include figures in the foreground and a large mansion in the background. No marks were recovered. The
sherds recovered are from a plate of unknown size printed in a blue negative print, meaning that the background is
blue and the figures are white. Blue is the only color recovered. This pattern was probably made by Enoch Wood &
Sons (1818–1846), but the importer is unknown. Based on the common use of whiteware by ca. 1820 and the end
production date of the probable maker, the summary date is ca. 1820–1846.

HONG KONG

69

HONG KONG
Charles Meigh, 1835–1849
The border has an edge pattern with a triangular design intertwined with a willow tree and flowers. The scene frame
mirrors the edge pattern. This chinoiserie pattern, Hong Kong, has a view with two pagodas, two figures on a bridge,
trees, and stylized rocks. An impressed Improved Stone China mark and a printed pattern mark were recovered. The
vessel illustrated is a 9½-inch plate printed in flow blue, the only color recovered. This pattern was probably made by
Charles Meigh (1835–1849). The importer is unknown. Based on the probable maker, the summary date is 1835–
1849.

INDIAN JAR

INDIAN JAR
multiple makers, ca. 1843–1846
This pattern has a very elaborate border consisting of a series of alternating reserves filled with different patterns.
There is crosshatching, a brickwork design, a dark area framed by feathered scrolls, and single rosettes. Also note the
distinctive well wreath. This pattern, Indian Jar, has a view with an urn-shaped jar and flowers sitting on a stylized
base made of scrolls. No marks were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from a basin of unknown size printed in
flow blue, the only color recovered. This pattern was made by two different but related potters, thus confining it to a
series of partnerships. Both Jacob & Thomas Furnival (ca. 1843) and Thomas Furnival & Co. (ca. 1844–1846) made
this pattern. The importer is unknown. Based on the possible makers, the summary date is ca. 1843–1846.

ISOLA BELLA

71

ISOLA BELLA
William Adams & Sons, ca. 1820–1864
The border has a background of small leafy sprigs over which are set alternating starbursts and groups of flowers. This
pattern, Isola Bella, has a view that varies but usually includes large buildings, a fountain, and figures. No marks were
recovered. The sherds illustrated are from indeterminate hollowware and flatware forms of unknown size printed on
whiteware in blue, the only color recovered. This pattern was probably made by William Adams & Sons (1769–
1966). The importer is unknown. Published examples of this pattern have a mark used between 1819 and 1864.
Davenport also made a pattern called Isola Bella, but it is unknown if it is the same pattern. Based on the common use
of whiteware by ca. 1820 and published marks, the summary date is ca. 1820–1864.

72

ITALIAN BUILDINGS

ITALIAN BUILDINGS
Ralph Hall, ca. 1822–1836
The border is a complex combination of a draping edge pattern, alternating floral and scroll reserves, and a partial
background of vertical lines. Note the distinctive scene frame. This pattern, Italian Buildings, has a view that varies
but usually includes buildings and water in the background, two women, an urn, and a vase of flowers in the foreground. Fragments of a printed maker’s mark (bottom) were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from an indeterminate flatware form of unknown size printed in blue, the only color recovered. This pattern was made by Ralph Hall
(ca. 1822–1836). The importer is unknown. Based on the maker, the summary date is ca. 1822–1836.

JAPAN FLOWERS

73

JAPAN FLOWERS
Ridgway, Morley, Wear & Co., 1836–1842
Both the border and the view exhibit small amounts of variation within a basic design scheme. The portion of the
border that never changes consists of sections of large scrolls and stylized flowers alternating with scenic reserves. The
reserves always contain chinoiserie buildings and figures, but the type of building may vary. This pattern, Japan
Flowers, has a view that typically is some combination of a prominent vase of flowers and an urn in the foreground
with buildings in the background. The precise appearance of these elements can differ. A printed maker-and-pattern
mark was recovered. The sherds illustrated show the primary portions of the border and a central scene slightly
different from each published example examined. They are from a 7-inch plate printed in blue, the only color recovered. The maker is Ridgway, Morley, Wear & Co. (1836–1842). The importer is unknown. Based on the maker, the
summary date is 1836–1842.

74

LAUSANNE VILLA

LAUSANNE VILLA
maker unknown, ca. 1827–1850
Two published examples of this pattern have been located. However, one spells the pattern name “Lousanne” Villa,
and neither provides a photograph of the pattern mark to confirm the correct spelling. It is assumed here that
Lausanne is correct since it is the name of a town in Switzerland on the shores of Lake Geneva that served as
inspiration for a different pattern by Copeland & Garrett. The border has crosshatching set with alternating reserves
and groups of flowers. The scene frame consists of small flowers. This pattern, Lausanne Villa, has a view that varies
but typically includes buildings with tall spires, a waterway, and figures. No marks were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from an indeterminate flatware form of unknown size printed in purple, the only color recovered. The
maker and importer of this pattern are unknown. Published examples of this pattern are dated to ca. 1850. Based on
the mean beginning production date of ca. 1827 for purple printing and published date estimates, the summary date
is ca. 1827–1850.

LAWRENCE

75

LAWRENCE
maker unknown, ca. 1842–1858
The border is a linear style with the concentric lines serving as a background over which grape vines frame scenic
reserves. Each reserve shows the same buildings. This pattern, Lawrence, has one view that is a romantic-style scene
with a large ornate building and three figures in the foreground. No marks were recovered. The sherd illustrated is
from a large indeterminate flatware form of unknown size printed in blue, the only color recovered. The maker and
importer are unknown. This border type was most common from ca. 1842 to 1858, making that the most likely
summary date.

76

LOBELIA

LOBELIA
George Phillips, ca. 1834–1848
The border consists of naturalistic trailing grape vines with leaves and occasional grapes. This pattern, Lobelia, has an
associated view of a cluster of lobelia flowers that are lilylike in appearance. A printed maker’s mark was recovered.
The sherd illustrated is from an indeterminate flatware form of unknown size. Although most of the references in
which this pattern was found refer to it as a flow blue, the sherd recovered from Quintana does not appear to be flow
blue. Rather, the “halo” effect around the flower buds consists of purposefully placed stippled dots as part of the
design. Also, the blue color does not occur beyond the stippling, as it would in flow blue. Based on the intensity of the
cobalt in this design, it is more accurate to classify this example as a blue/deep blue transfer print, the only color
recovered. The maker is George Phillips (ca. 1834–1848), but the importer is unknown. Based on the maker, the
summary date is ca. 1834–1848.

LOMBARDY

77

LOMBARDY
Joseph Heath & Co., 1828–1841
The border consists of groups of stylized flowers set over a background design. Note also the string element that
makes up the edge pattern. This pattern, Lombardy, has a view that always pictures figures in a gondola with buildings and trees in the background. Impressed and printed tally marks were recovered. The vessel illustrated is a double
curve cup of unknown size printed in blue, the only color recovered. This pattern was probably made by Joseph
Heath & Co. (1828–1841). The importer is unknown. Based on the probable maker, the summary date is 1828–
1841.

78

LOZERE

LOZERE
Edward Challinor, 1842–1867
This linear-style border has reserves framed by scrolls. The scenic vignettes consist of buildings. Note especially the
string element, which also is used as the well wreath. This pattern, Lozere, has a view that exhibits some variation,
primarily in the expansion or contraction of the basic view to fit the size and shape of the vessel. The view has figures
next to a fountain in the foreground, large trees, and a castle in the background. Fragments of a printed maker-andpattern mark were recovered. Sherds illustrated are from a pitcher or jug of unknown size printed in blue, the only
color recovered. The maker is Edward Challinor (1842–1867). The importer is unknown. Based on the maker, the
summary date is 1842–1867.

MARBLE

79

MARBLE
multiple makers, ca. 1841–1858
Marble has no separate border, but instead is what is known as a sheet pattern. Such patterns consist of a repeating
motif that is continuous over the surface of the vessel. Often sheet patterns are floral, but this pattern, Marble, has
random angular components designed to mimic the appearance of the veins in marble. Because of the type of pattern,
there is no separate view. Although some authors offer a different description of the technology involved in achieving
the marbled effect, the designs from this example have obvious stippling from the engraving process and would have
been applied in the same manner as any other transfer print. No marks were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from
indeterminate flatware and hollowware forms of unknown sizes printed in flow mulberry, the only color recovered.
Various makers produced Marble patterns, and some variation can be observed from maker to maker. Possible manufacturers for the examples illustrated include Thomas Dimmock (1828–1859), W. T. Copeland (1847–1998), Davenport
(ca. 1793–1887), Anthony Shaw (ca. 1851–1900), John Wedge Wood (1841–1860), and additional unknown makers.
Based on the years of heaviest production for flow mulberry wares, the summary date is between ca. 1841 and 1858.

The border is a linear type, over which there is a worm-track design. It is finished at both the edge and well wreath
with a distinctive string element. This pattern, Marino, has varying views with the basic elements consisting of an urn
in the foreground, a central waterway with a gondola, and tall buildings in the background. No marks were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from an indeterminate flatware form of unknown size printed in blue, the only color
recovered. A variety of companies made this pattern, including George Phillips (1834–1838); Cork, Edge & Malkin
(1860–1871); Edge, Malkin & Co. (1871–1903); Thomas Godwin (1834–1854); Thomas Phillips & Son (1845–
1846); and Thomas Till & Son (ca. 1850–1861). Any1 of these companies could have produced the sherds recovered
from Quintana. The importer is unknown. Based on the possible makers and the general decline of popularity of this
transfer-print style, the summary date is ca. 1834–1880.

MEDINA

81

MEDINA
William Ridgway, ca. 1830–1834
This border has crosshatching finished by scrolls and hung with floral swags. This exotic pattern, Medina, has a
varying view with the main elements consisting of equestrian figures in the foreground and eastern buildings in the
background. Portions of a printed maker-and-pattern mark were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from an indeterminate flatware form of unknown size printed in blue, the only color recovered. Several companies made patterns
called Medina, all of which are different. This example was produced by William Ridgway (ca. 1830–1834). The
importer is unknown. Based on the maker, the summary date is ca. 1830–1834.

MELISSA

MELISSA (see Color Plate 8)
Powell, Bishop & Stonier, 1891
There is no separate border on this pattern. Melissa has a view consisting only of branches of blossoms. A printed
maker and pattern mark was recovered. The vessel illustrated is a 3½-inch-tall cup printed in green, the only color
recovered. The maker is Powell, Bishop & Stonier (1878–1891). The importer is unknown. The inclusion of a
country of origin on marks was required beginning in 1891 to comply with the McKinley Tariff Act. At that time
Powell, Bishop & Stonier incorporated the word “England” in thier mark. Therefore, 1891 is the summary date since
it is the only year in which this vessel could have been made.

MELTON

83

MELTON (see Color Plate 3)
Alfred Meakin, 1891–1897
Decorative elements on this pattern are primarily restricted to the border, which features two primary motifs of a
large, stylized flower and scrolls alternating with sprigs of more-naturalistic leaves and flowers. This pattern, Melton,
has no central view. A printed maker-and-pattern mark was recovered. The vessels illustrated are a 2¼-inch-tall
handled cup, an 8-inch plate, a 9-inch plate, and a cup plate (with mark) of unknown size, all printed in a late-style
flow blue, the only color recovered. The maker is Alfred Meakin (1875–1897). The importer is unknown. Based on
the inclusion of a country of origin on the mark, a feature not previously used by Alfred Meakin, and the maker, the
summary date is 1891–1897.

MULETEER

85

MULETEER
Davenport, ca. 1820–1860
The border is an ornate combination of scrolls, flowers, and birds. This pattern, Muleteer, has a view that varies but
typically features a man riding a mule, along with a small waterfall. A printed pattern mark was recovered. The sherds
illustrated are from a large platter and a flatware form of unknown size printed in blue, the only color recovered. The
maker is probably Davenport (ca. 1793–1887), and the importer is not indicated. Most Davenport wares marked
with pattern cartouches date to the period ca. 1820 to 1860, making that the most likely summary date.

86

NAPIER

NAPIER
Samuel Alcock & Co., ca. 1830–1859
This pattern is well illustrated in the Velasco catalogue with a partially reconstructed plate, a pattern mark, and closeups of two central view elements. It is included again to show an impressed maker’s mark. The border has an elaborate geometric edge pattern that frames a series of geometric and floral reserves alternating with scenic vignettes of
pagodas. The scene frame matches the rim pattern. This pattern, Napier, has a view that almost never varies except to
adapt to fit vessel size and form. The primary elements of the pattern are three Chinese figures on a platform awaiting
the arrival of two more people in an approaching sampan. A printed pattern mark and an impressed maker’s mark
were recovered. The printed mark is an oval cartouche that reads “NAPIER/Imperial/Stone.” The impressed mark
is a distinct beehive motif with “Alcock” arching over it. The sherds illustrated are from a plate of unknown size
printed in green. Sherds printed in blue were also recovered. Although Napier is usually considered to be a product of
John and George Alcock, the beehive mark is as consistently identified with Samuel Alcock & Co. (ca. 1830–1859).
It is possible that, because the different members of the Alcock family worked together in various partnerships, there
was some exchange of patterns or wares. The importer is unknown. Based on the maker, the summary date is ca.
1830–1859.

ORIENTAL

87

ORIENTAL
Samuel Moore & Co., ca. 1829–1874
The border consists of two different alternating floral reserves, each separated by scrolls. The string elements at the
rim pattern and well wreath have distinctive heart-shaped motifs. This pattern, Oriental, has a view that varies somewhat but typically contains large buildings in the background and center, a sailboat, and deer in the foreground. No
marks were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from a footed hollowware form of unknown size printed in green.
Brown-printed sherds were also recovered. This version of the pattern was probably manufactured by Samuel Moore
& Co. (1803–1874). The importer is unknown. Based on the mean beginning production date of ca. 1829 for brown
printing and the probable maker, the summary date is ca. 1829–1874.

88

ORIENTAL

ORIENTAL (see Color Plate 6)
William Ridgway, ca. 1830–1834
This pattern, also called Oriental, is different from the Samuel Moore & Co. pattern of the same name. The border
has a background of fine stippling and small flowers. Reserves are defined by flowers and scrolls, with large reserves
showing a scenic vignette and smaller reserves showing clusters of flowers. Note also the distinctive scene frame. This
pattern, Oriental, has a varying view but usually contains prominent eastern buildings, palm trees, and several figures
with a camel in the foreground. A printed maker-and-pattern mark was recovered. Vessels illustrated are a 10-inch
plate printed in blue and a probable pitcher of unknown size printed in brown. Sherds printed in purple, green, and
black were also recovered. The urn-and-beehive mark is a standard type commonly used by William Ridgway (ca.
1830–1834). The importer is unknown. Based on the style of this William Ridgeway mark, the summary date is ca.
1830–1834.

PAGODA

PAGODA
Enoch Wood & Sons, ca. 1829–1846
The border consists of naturalistic flowers and butterflies arranged around the marly. The edge pattern is a distinctive
double row of triangles. The border is sometimes trimmed down to fit the vessel shape or size. This pattern, Pagoda,
has a view with only a small amount of variation. Usually, a basket of flowers and fruit with birds are in the foreground, and a pagoda (of different types) is in the background. No marks were recovered. Sherds illustrated are from
a flatware form of unknown size printed in red, the only color recovered. The maker is probably Enoch Wood & Sons
(1818–1846), but the importer is unknown. Based on the mean beginning production date of ca. 1829 for red
printing and the end production date for the maker, the summary date is ca. 1829–1846.

PALESTINE

91

PALESTINE (see Color Plate 9)
Elijah Jones (Cobridge), ca. 1831–1839
This pattern is defined by a set border and a series of different central views named by the maker. The border has a
series of stylized flowers over a finely stippled background. Note the distinctive edge pattern and the ornate well
wreath with its scrolls, crosshatching, and floral sprigs. For this pattern, Palestine (which is different from another
pattern of the same name), there are two published examples of views, called Shechem and Sidon (both cities in the
Holy Land). Those views both have figures and a camel in the foreground, palm trees, eastern buildings in the
background, and well-defined clouds. The view on sherds from Quintana is not an exact match to either published
view, suggesting that these sherds are part of a possible third view in the series. The small portion of the view
recovered (some was lost due to saltwater damage) crossmends and features recognizable palm trees, far-eastern-style
buildings, and well-defined clouds of the same style as the other views. A printed pattern-and-view mark was recovered. The mark for this pattern features a water well on which is written the pattern name, the maker’s initials, and the
name of the view beneath. The mark, though fragmentary, clearly reads Palestine (top), with a view name beginning
“Mount. . . ” (bottom). In the ninth century B.C. in the Biblical world, Sidon was part of Phoenicia, Shechem was
part of the neighboring Kingdom of Israel, and there were at least three notable mountains in the immediate vicinity.
They include Mt. Ephraim, Mt. Gilboa, and Mt. Carmel (Hammond 1984:H-4). It is possible that one of these
mountains is the subject of this view. The sherds illustrated are from a 9-inch plate printed in purple, the only color
recovered. Published examples of this pattern are marked with the maker’s initials E. J., which are usually attributed
to Elijah Jones of Cobridge (ca. 1831–1839), although there were several smaller potters in different locations by the
same name. The importer is unknown. Based on the probable maker, the summary date is ca. 1831–1839.

PALESTINE

PALMYRA

93

PALMYRA
Thomas Furnival & Co., 1845–1846
The border consists of very closely spaced concentric lines forming an overall crosshatch pattern. A wreath of acorns
and oak leaves runs around the circumference, and the well wreath has a distinctive string element. This pattern,
Palmyra, has an associated view with tall buildings in the background, a central body of water, figures next to an urn,
and a large tree in the foreground. No marks were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from a cup plate of unknown
size printed in blue, the only color recovered. The Palmyra pattern was registered by Thomas Furnival & Co. (ca.
1844–1846) in 1845. The importer is unknown. Based on the registration date and the probable maker, the summary
date is 1845 to 1846.

94

PRIORY

PRIORY
Edward Challinor & Co., 1853–1862
The border has areas of crosshatching set apart from scenic reserves by ornate scrolls. Sections of each are illustrated.
This pattern, Priory, has a view that features a large castle in the background, trees to either side, and a family group
on the banks of a river. A printed pattern mark was recovered. The sherds illustrated are from a cup plate of unknown
size printed in blue, the only color recovered. Edward Challinor & Co. (1853–1862) made this version of the pattern.
The importer is unknown. Based on the probable maker, the summary date is 1853 to 1862.

RESIDENCE OF THE LATE RICHARD JORDAN, NEW JERSEY

95

THE RESIDENCE OF THE LATE RICHARD JORDAN, NEW JERSEY
(see Color Plate 9)

Joseph Heath & Co., 1828–1841
The border has beading at the edge that frames a design of flowers and scrolls. This pattern, The Residence of the Late
Richard Jordan, New Jersey, has a view featuring the historical figure Richard Jordan, a Quaker minister, in front of his
home. Also included is an outbuilding, fence, and cow. A printed maker-and-pattern mark was recovered, as well as impressed
and printed tally marks. The vessel illustrated is a 9-inch plate printed in purple, the only color recovered. The maker is
Joseph Heath & Co. (1828–1841). The importer is unknown. Based on the maker, the summary date is 1828–1841.

RHENISH VIEWS/RHINE

RHENISH VIEWS/RHINE
Davenport, ca. 1846–1880
This pattern has a reported series of approximately 10 different views, as well as two entirely different borders with
which those views were used. All of the various combinations of views and borders were considered by the manufacturer to be the same pattern. The border recovered at Quintana has a generic scroll and floral design, with the
diagnostic element being the sawtooth and diamond edge pattern. The views typically feature large trees in the
foreground, a central waterway, and buildings nestled against the base of a mountain in the background. No marks
were recovered. The sherd illustrated is from an indeterminate hollowware form of unknown size printed in blue, the
only color recovered. This pattern was probably made by Davenport (ca. 1793–1887), which used both Rhenish
Views and Rhine as the pattern name in the factory. The importer is not indicated. References note that the floral
border for this pattern dates to ca. 1846. Based on this information and the date of decline in the popularity in this
style of transfer print, the summary date is ca. 1846–1880.

RHINE

97

RHINE
Thomas Dimmock & Co., 1844–1859
This border has oak leaves separated by stylized arch shapes. This pattern, Rhine, has views that vary but usually
include a distinctive chalet-type building, large trees, and a river running through the center of the scene. No mark
was recovered. The sherds illustrated are from an indeterminate flatware form of unknown size printed in flow blue,
the only color recovered. Rhine was patented as a pattern by Thomas Dimmock & Co. (ca. 1828–1859) in 1844. The
importer is unknown. Based on the patent date and the probable maker, the summary date is 1844–1859.

SEA LEAF

SEA LEAF
Davenport, 1836
This pattern is well illustrated in the Velasco catalogue with pictures of a partially crossmended saucer, a printed
importer’s mark, and a printed maker’s mark. It is included here to show a dated maker’s mark. The pattern itself is
a very simple all-over design with no distinct border. The pattern, Sea Leaf, consists of branching tendrils with small
circular growths. There is no separate view. A printed maker’s mark and an impressed-and-dated maker’s mark were
recovered. The sherds illustrated are from a cup of unknown size printed in black. Sherds printed in blue and green
were also recovered. The maker is Davenport (ca. 1793–1887), but the importer is not indicated. The impressed
anchor mark bears the year date for 1836, making that the summary date for this piece.

SHAPOO

99

SHAPOO
multiple makers, ca. 1842–1858
This is the same as the patterns referred to as BAS #142 and BAS #156 in the Velasco catalogue. The border consists
of crosshatching set with flowers and reserves. This pattern, Shapoo, has an accompanying view with a pagoda, large
trees, and two figures playing horns while crossing a bridge in the foreground. A small portion of a printed pattern
mark was recovered, but not enough to specify a maker. The sherds illustrated are from a basin and an indeterminate
flatware form of unknown size printed in flow mulberry, the only color recovered. Three different potters are known
to have made the Shapoo pattern: T. & R. Boote Ltd. (1842–1906), Thomas Hughes (ca. 1860–1894), and Thomas
Hughes & Son, Ltd. (1895–1957). The importer is unknown. All of these companies enjoyed long periods of production, and theoretically any of these potters could have made Shapoo at any time during these date ranges. However, considering the context of the rest of the assemblage and the history of Quintana, the most likely summary date
for these sherds is ca. 1842–1858, when flow mulberry patterns were most popular.

“SHELL BORDER–IRREGULAR CENTER”

“SHELL BORDER–IRREGULAR CENTER” (see Color Plate 2)
Enoch Wood & Sons, 1818–1835
This name is an attributed one given by collectors. The border itself consists of groupings of seashells against a
delicate floral background. The edge of the border around the well wreath is irregular, following the shape of the
shells where it opens into the well. It also has a distinctive semicircular string element as the edge pattern. The pattern
name is unknown. This border framed a series of historical and nautical views. An impressed maker’s mark that reads
“WOOD” was recovered. The example illustrated is a small footed serving vessel of unknown size, such as a sauce
tureen, and it is printed in deep blue on pearlware or on a body with a pearlware/whiteware transitional glaze. No
other colors were recovered. The maker is Enoch Wood & Sons (1818–1846). The importer is unknown. The
summary date is 1818–1835; based on the pearlware glaze and the popularity of deep blue prints between ca. 1819
and 1835, it is suggested that this example could have been made in the earlier years of Wood’s production.

SPANISH CONVENT

101

SPANISH CONVENT
William Adams & Sons, ca. 1829–1864
The border is dominated by large scenic reserves defined by feathered scrolls. The reserves contain two alternating scenes
of large building complexes and are separated by crosshatching and a floral group with a large passion flower. The edge
pattern consists of small round elements, and the scene frame string element resembles a continuous mossy sprig. This
pattern, Spanish Convent, has views that vary widely but are typically religious in nature. There are usually large church or
cathedral buildings, sometimes shrines, crosses, or statues in the foreground, and also figures (sometimes ecclesiastic). No
marks were recovered. The sherds illustrated are from indeterminate flatware forms of unknown sizes printed in blue,
brown, and red. This pattern was probably made by William Adams & Sons (1819–1966). The importer is unknown.
Published examples reportedly have a mark used from ca. 1800 to 1864. Based on the mean beginning production date of ca.
1829 for both brown and red printing and published marks, the summary date is ca. 1829–1864.

“SUPPLEMENTAL UNASCRIBED FLORAL #5”

“SUPPLEMENTAL UNASCRIBED FLORAL #5”
maker unknown, ca. 1833–1849
This is an attributed name given by collectors. The border has bouquets of flowers and baskets of flowers separated by
rectangular reserves infilled with lattice. The reserves are surrounded by scrolls. The pattern name is unknown. The
view consists of a central bouquet of flowers surrounded by a scene frame of dagger shapes. No marks were recovered.
The sherds illustrated are from a saucer of unknown size printed in blue, the only color recovered. The maker and
importer are unknown. However, for the purposes of the summary date, central floral motif patterns were most
popular during the period ca. 1833–1849.

“SUPPLEMENTAL UNASCRIBED SCENIC #23”

103

“SUPPLEMENTAL UNASCRIBED SCENIC #23”
maker unknown, ca. 1827–1880
This is an attributed name given by collectors. The border has an edge pattern of small circles with alternating
diamond shapes set above them. The remainder of the border has a field of small leaves over which are set clusters of
naturalistic flowers. The pattern name is unknown. The view is a scenic one with a long line of low buildings,
mountains in the background, and a fence and flowers in the foreground. The main building is a larger chalet-type
structure. No marks were recovered. The vessel shown is a London-shaped cup of unknown size printed in purple, the
only color recovered. Although this is a recognized pattern, the maker and importer are not known. Based on the
mean beginning production date of ca. 1827 for purple printing and the dates for the decrease in popularity of this
style of transfer print, the summary date is ca. 1827–1880.

SWISS BOY

SWISS BOY
Job & John Jackson, 1831–1835
This pattern is the same as BAS #102 in the Velasco catalogue. The border has an edge pattern of circles between
triangular shapes, under which are groups of flowers set on a band against a backdrop of stylized florets. A portion of
the border on this rim sherd has been lost due to saltwater damage. There are two string elements at the well wreath.
The outer element is a beaded line, and the inner element consists of small buds. This pattern, Swiss Boy, has a view
featuring a boy wearing short pants and leaning against a large tree stump. A small dark dog has jumped up and is
leaning his front paws against the boy’s leg (bottom right). A portion of a printed pattern mark was recovered,
featuring the pattern name in script letters surrounded by a mossy sprig cartouche. An impressed asterisk tally mark
is immediately above and slightly overlaps the upper edge of the printed mark (bottom left). The sherds illustrated are
from a saucer of unknown size. This example is printed in a soft shade of blue and is somewhat blurry. No other colors
were recovered. This pattern was probably made by Job & John Jackson (1831–1835). The importer is unknown.
Based on the probable maker, the summary date is 1831–1835.

TONQUIN

105

TONQUIN
William Adams & Sons, ca. 1841–1864
The border has scenic reserves with pagodas and flowers separated by very strong single rosette medallions with
crosshatching surrounded by dark scrolls. The edge pattern is a band filled with triangular designs. The well wreath
has an interlocking geometric motif. This pattern, Tonquin, has a view featuring several sets of large elaborate pagodas
with multiple bridges, one large tree, and two small figures in the foreground. A printed maker-and-pattern mark was
recovered. The vessel illustrated is an 8½-inch plate printed in flow blue, the only color recovered. The maker is
William Adams & Sons (1819–1966). The importer is unknown. This type of mark was commonly used between
1819 and 1864. However, since flow blue chinoiserie landscape patterns were not readily available until ca. 1841, the
summary date is ca. 1841–1864.

TONQUIN

TONQUIN
Joseph Heath, 1845–1853
This flow blue chinoiserie pattern, also named Tonquin, is completely different from the pattern previously described.
The border is confined within two bands of a diamond design. A major portion of the border is floral, with large
Asiatic blossoms occasionally set with triangular scroll reserves capped by half-flowers. This pattern, Tonquin, has a
view featuring two figures fishing from a sampan. A fence is in the foreground, and the boat is surrounded by trees
and very large flowers. A printed maker-and-pattern mark was recovered. The vessel illustrated is a waste bowl 6
inches in diameter printed in flow blue, the only color recovered. The maker is Joseph Heath (1845–1853). The
importer is unknown. Based on the maker, the summary date is 1845–1853.

TUSCAN ROSE

107

TUSCAN ROSE (see Color Plate 2)
John & William Ridgway, ca. 1825–1830
The most distinctive elements of the border are the horizontal zigzag lines that serve as backdrops for swags of
naturalistic flowers. Note also the trefoil edge pattern and the distinctive scene frame of alternating stars and lozenges.
This pattern, Tuscan Rose, has a view featuring a woven basket with scrolls. From this basket, a profusion of flowers
trails up a single lattice. A butterfly is perched on a large blossom near the top. No marks were recovered. The vessel
illustrated is a large whiteware platter, approximately 18 inches long, with a scalloped and beaded edge and printed in
brown. Recovered sherds also are printed in blue and black. This pattern was probably made by John & William
Ridgway (ca. 1814–1830). The importer is unknown. Based on the mean beginning production date of ca. 1825 for
black printing and the probable maker, the summary date is ca. 1825–1830.

“TWO TEMPLES II”/BROSELEY

“TWO TEMPLES II”/BROSELEY
various makers, ca. 1820–1834
This pattern is a direct copy of a Chinese porcelain pattern. The pattern name varies in different sources, and published information differs as to whether the names are attributed by collectors or actual, or if the names apply to the
pattern or the view. In addition, a large number of potters made this pattern. “Two Temples II” is definitely an
attributed name used by some collectors. Sources vary as to whether Broseley is an actual pattern name, but it does
appear that at least some manufacturers (but perhaps not all) used it as such. The border has many of the typical
Chinese motifs: butterflies, lozenges, the Joo-I symbol, and a key motif. There is no well wreath or scene frame.
Although many Chinese and chinoiserie patterns share similar elements, this pattern, “Two Temples II”/Broseley is
unique. The view features two tall temples set adjacent so that they appear as one building. In the foreground are a
fence, a bridge with two figures, a willow tree, and an orange tree. The background has a small group of one-story
buildings along with a boat in the water. The pattern is occasionally reversed, believed to be due to the design being
copied from a transfer pull. No marks were recovered. The vessel illustrated is a whiteware mug of unknown size
printed in blue, the only color recovered. A large number of potters produced this design. They include Josiah
Wedgwood & Sons Ltd. (ca. 1759–present), William Mason (ca. 1811–1824), Davenport (ca. 1793–1887), John
Rogers & Son (ca. 1814–1836), George Grainger & Co. (ca. 1839–1902), Don Pottery (1790–1893), Spode (ca.
1784–1833), Copeland & Garrett (1833–1847), W. T. Copeland (1847–1998), and additional unknown makers.
The importer is unknown. This pattern was made over a long period of time, potentially throughout the nineteenth
century. However, the summary date for most directly copied Chinese designs on whiteware is ca. 1820–1834.

“TYROLEAN SCENE”

109

“TYROLEAN SCENE”
William Ridgway, ca. 1830–1834
No fragments of this border or pattern were recovered. However, two examples of the mark associated with this
pattern (and no other patterns by this maker) were identified. The mark has an urn sitting atop a rectangular shape
with “Improved Granite China” written in it. The maker’s name is in a separate rectangle below, and the whole device
is surrounded by leaves and flowers. A portion of an impressed Royal shield mark from the same maker was noted as
well. The marks were on indeterminate flatware forms and were printed in both black and blue. A published example
of this mark identifies it with William Ridgway (ca. 1830–1834). The importer is unknown. The summary date for
such a mark and any associated pattern is ca. 1830–1834.
References: Godden 1964:538; Williams and Weber 1986:254.

110

“UNIDENTIFIED PATTERN”

“UNIDENTIFIED PATTERN”
maker unknown, post–1891
The border has stylized flowers only at the upper edge of the rim. The pattern name is unknown. The view is an
asymmetrical arrangement of birds surrounding a central figure of a child and dog. A brown-printed location mark
reads “STAFFORDSHIRE ENGLAND.” The vessels illustrated are a cup of unknown size and a 5½-inch cup plate
printed in blue, the only color recovered. The maker and importer are unknown. The inclusion of a marked country
of origin indicates 1891 or later for a summary date.
References: Godden 1964:11.

VENETIAN TEMPLE

111

VENETIAN TEMPLE
William Adams & Sons, ca. 1829–1864
The border has semicircular reserves of flowers alternating with scrolls. Note also the complementary string elements
used at the edge pattern and well wreath. The pattern, Venetian Temple, has a single view that varies only to accommodate vessel size and shape. It features a four-columned temple and figures in a gondola on the water. A printed
pattern mark recovered confirms the pattern name, as illustrated. An impressed tally mark in the shape of an asterisk
slightly overlaps the printed mark. A saucer is the vessel pictured, and it is printed in red, the only color recovered for
this pattern. Venetian Temple was probably made by William Adams & Sons (1819–1966), but the importer is
unknown. Based on the mean beginning production date of ca. 1829 for red printing and the cartouche mark used
between 1819 and 1864, the summary date is ca. 1829–1864.

112

WARWICK VASE

WARWICK VASE
multiple makers, ca. 1827–1847
The border has two variations depending on the manufacturer. One is the same as Japan Flowers, with the exception
of having vases in the reserves. The other consists of acanthus scrolls. No sherds of either were recovered from
Quintana. The pattern, Warwick Vase, is unique in that the view features an actual object from antiquity. The vase has
distinctive figures on it, but the background of the scene varies in its composition of water and buildings on the shore.
No marks were recovered to aid in specifying a maker. The cup and indeterminate flatware form illustrated are
printed in black, the only color recovered. A number of makers produced patterns featuring the Warwick Vase. They
include Enoch Wood & Sons (1818–1846), J. & M. P. Bell & Co. (1842–1928), Elkin & Newbon (ca. 1844–1845),
Copeland & Garrett (1833–1847), possibly Ridgway, Morley, Wear & Co. (1836–1842), and additional unknown
makers. Any importer is unknown. Because so many potters made this pattern, the potential period of production is
very long. However, the summary date has been refined to ca. 1827–1847, when classical designs were most popular
and in their height of production.

1978:82.

WESTERN STAR

113

WESTERN STAR
William Ridgway, ca. 1830–1834
The border consists of diagonally curving bands infilled with three different designs, as shown. The pattern, Western
Star, has a view consisting of a central star-shaped medallion. No marks were recovered in association with this
pattern. The sherds illustrated are from an indeterminate hollowware form and are printed in blue. Black was also
recovered. The maker is probably William Ridgway (ca. 1830–1834), but the importer is unknown. Based on the
maker’s span of operation, the summary date is ca. 1830–1834.
References: Godden 1964:538; Pollan et al. 1996:129; Williams 1978:678.

114

WILLOW

WILLOW (see Color Plate 5)
multiple makers, ca. 1820–1880
The border contains a number of chinoiserie motifs, including latticework, key motifs, and other geometric designs.
The pattern, Willow, is one of the most popular and well-known transfer-printed designs ever produced and is still
made. The view has a standard arrangement of a pagoda under an apple tree, three figures crossing a bridge under a
willow tree, a boat in the river, and two doves in the sky. Minor variations occur. No marks were recovered to aid in
dating or in the identification of a maker. The 7-inch plate illustrated is printed in blue on whiteware. Blue is the only
color recovered, and was by far the most popular color for the pattern in general. Due to the huge popularity of
Willow, at least 54 known British potters produced the pattern in the pre-1880 period. Any specific importer is
unknown. Based on the common use of whiteware by ca. 1820 and the date of general decline in the popularity of this
style of transfer print, the summary date is ca. 1820–1880.

BAS #28

115

BAS #28
unknown maker, ca. 1820–1835
This is an attributed designation given by collectors. The border has flowers, leaves, and bushes. The edge pattern is
a distinctive string element of circles and sawteeth. The pattern name and view are unknown. No marks were recovered. The vessel form illustrated is an indeterminate flatware form and is printed in deep blue on whiteware. Deep
blue is the only color recovered. The maker is unknown, as is the importer. Based on the color and ware type, the
summary date is ca. 1820–1835, the period when deep blue printing on whitewares was most popular.

GLOSSARY

121

Border: The defining component of a transfer-printed
pattern (Pollan et al. 1996:11); however, it should be
noted that companies occasionally copied, borrowed,
or purchased border patterns from other makers
(Majewski and O’Brien 1987:143–144). A border is the
overall decorative frame that surrounds the view. It can
incorporate a variety of different string elements. Portions of the border can also be used to decorate the
exterior or interior rim of hollowwares. Border designs
exhibit a variety of styles popular in different periods,
which can be useful for dating. Two styles commonly
seen at Quintana include vignette, or reserve, borders
(incorporating cartouches with scenes or designs) and
linear borders (with continuous repeating linear backgrounds) (Samford 1997:21). For an example of a
vignette/reserve border, see the Cyrene pattern; for an
example of a linear border, see the Columbia pattern.

Marly: The outer edge of a plate or platter; where border
patterns are typically placed. For a diagram of vessel
parts, see Figure 3.

Chinoiserie: Patterns derived from or inspired by
Chinese sources, but not direct copies of Chinese designs
(Samford 1997:8).

Registry Marks: Diamond-shaped marks either printed
or impressed on a vessel. These indicate either vessel
shapes or transfer patterns that were registered with the
Patent Office in London. The registration was designed
to protect designs from pilfering by other companies.
Each mark has a series of letters and numbers that can
be decoded by referring to any number of common
references such as Godden (1964:527) and Majewski
and O’Brien (1987:168). The year date on such marks
refers to the year of registration, not manufacture. For
an example, see the Athens pattern.

Clobbering: The use of polychrome enamels (such
as blue, red, green, and yellow) overglaze to accent a
transfer-printed pattern, usually only in small areas.
This technique was most common after 1840
(Samford 1997:22). For an example, see the Florilla
pattern.
Edge Pattern: A string element located closest to the
rim or lip of a vessel, usually an integral part of the border
design (Pollan et al. 1996:11).
Flown Colors: A technological printing innovation
introduced in the early 1830s. The introduction of
volatizing solution in the kiln during firing caused the
color of the transfer to flow or appear fuzzy to varying
degrees. This type of decoration had two periods of
popularity, first in the 1840s and 1850s, and again ca.
1890–1904. Flown wares are most commonly blue, but
flow mulberry (also called flow black) was produced as
well (Samford 1997:24). For an example of an early
period flow blue, see the Amoy pattern; for a late
example of flow blue, see the Melton pattern; and for
an example of flow mulberry, see the Shapoo pattern.
London Shape: A common shape for both handleless
cups and bowls, it has been described as an “inverted
truncated cone with a steeply angled shoulder just above
a high standing foot ring” (Miller 1991:15). The shape
is defined by a carination around the body (Sussman
1997:10). For illustrations of the London shape, see
Figures 2 and 3.

McKinley Tariff: This 1890 tariff was designed to
protect domestic industry by levying extremely high
duties on imports, thus making it difficult for foreign
goods to compete in the American market. One practical
effect for the ceramics industry was the requirement of
marking the country of origin on wares beginning in
1891, thus making it a useful dating tool. However, it
should be noted that a few companies included the word
“England” in their marks prior to 1891. Therefore, standard references on makers’ marks should be checked
before dates are assigned to marks. For an example of a
mark that includes county of origin due to the tariff, see
the Melissa pattern maker’s mark.

Scene Frame: A string element that surrounds the view
but is not an integral part of the border (Pollan et al.
1996:11).
String Element: Repetitive and continuous decorative
motifs used primarily as components of a border. String
elements are often unique to a particular pattern, making
them ideal for use in pattern identification. They can be
utilized in varying arrangements on different vessel
forms (Pollan et al. 1996:11).
Summary Date: For the purposes of this study, the
summary date is the range of years that a specific vessel
was most probably manufactured. The beginning and
end dates are derived from a number of factors including
makers’ marks, importers’ marks, ware type, transferprinting style, color, view style, and border style. The
literature available on ceramics studies was referenced
in order to utilize the most current knowledge in the
field. Summary dates do not reflect the maximum span
of time in which a specific vessel might have been made,
but instead address the most likely period of manufacture, popularity, and use.

122

The Quintana Collection

View: Also called a central scene, the view is the main
design enclosed by the border. Views can vary greatly
but typically consist of landscapes, floral arrangements,
or still lifes. Views were commonly copied between
manufacturers, making them less reliable for identification purposes (Majewski and O’Brien 1987:143).
Different styles of views were popular in certain periods.
Examples include Chinese (direct copies of Chinese
patterns), chinoiserie (derived from Chinese patterns),
exotic (based on eastern or Oriental themes), American
historical (celebrating people or events from American
history), central floral (a single floral arrangement), classical (encompassing Greek, Roman, or other classical
motifs), romantic (stylized landscapes with buildings,
people, and bodies of water), and gothic (usually
featuring ruins or castles) (Samford 1997:7–19).

Well Wreath: Usually a more complex string element
located at the lower edge of the border. The well wreath
is an integral part of the border (Pollan et al. 1996:11).
White Granite: Also called ironstone, this is a
semivitreous white-bodied ware, often with molded
decoration. Commonly used in the 1840s to 1860s for
transfer- or flow-printed patterns (Majewski and O’Brien
1987:120–124). For an example, see the Hong Kong
pattern.
Whiteware: A nonvitreous white-bodied earthenware
with a clear glaze most commonly used after 1820. It is
the ware type on which a majority of the transfers in
this collection were printed (Majewski and O’Brien
1987:119–120).
