MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During the 2019 calendar year, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted intensive cultural resources surveys for six proposed Anadarko Petroleum
Corporation (Anadarko) projects located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office
(GLO) in Reeves County, Texas (Project Areas). These projects included well pads, access
roads, and pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs). All six projects were privately funded and did not
require any federal permitting or coordination. However, as the GLO is considered to be a
political subdivision of the State of Texas, the portions of the six projects on GLO property all fell
under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton
Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon conducted the cultural resources surveys of the Project Areas
on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. Overall, these surveys assessed
approximately 21.9 acres of GLO land. The purpose of the surveys was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the six Project Areas and, if any existed, to determine if
the projects had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for
formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The cultural resources surveys were
conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 8751.
The cultural resources surveys of the six Project Areas resulted in entirely negative
results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the assessed locations or within
any of the excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the development of
the six projects would have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or
considered eligible for designation as SALs on GLO property. Horizon therefore recommended
that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects relative to the
jurisdiction of the ACT. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) concurred with these
recommendations for all six projects.
All recovered cultural materials (if any) and all original field notes, maps, drawings, and
photographs were to be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and Texas Administrative Code Title 13,
Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of intensive cultural resources surveys conducted
during the 2019 calendar year for six proposed Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko)
projects located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO) in Reeves County,
Texas (Project Areas) (Figure 1-1). All six projects were privately funded and did not require
any federal permitting or coordination. However, as the GLO is considered to be a political
subdivision of the State, the portions of the six projects on GLO property fell under the
regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc.
(Whitenton), Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural resources
surveys of the Project Areas on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The purpose
of the surveys was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the six Project
Areas and, if any existed, to determine if the projects had the potential to have any adverse
impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SALs). The cultural resources surveys were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee
(TAC) annual permit number 8751.
The six Anadarko projects assessed by Horizon in 2019 included well pads, access
roads, and pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs) that were located wholly or in part on tracts of land
owned by the GLO. The well pads are typically constructed by leveling each area by bulldozing
the higher elevations and using that material to fill the lower elevations. Additional fill may be
brought in if necessary. The well pads often have associated reserve pits to contain liquids
associated with or produced by the well drilling. Reserve pit construction typically consists of
the excavation of a pit several feet deep that is then filled with a polyethylene liner. Access road
construction consists of the bulldozing (cutting and filling) of the alignment and may also include
the capping of the alignment with caliche or other forms of road base. Pipeline construction
efforts consist clearing vegetation from each ROW via heavy machinery, followed by the
excavation of the pipeline trench measuring several feet wide and excavated down to depths
around 6.0 feet (1.8 meters [m]) below surface. Only the portions of each project situated on
GLO land were assessed under TAC annual permit number 8751. These included the entirety
of certain projects and only portions of others. Overall, these surveys assessed approximately
21.9 acres of GLO land. Each of the six projects is listed in Table 1-1, along with its map
identifier in Figure 1-1. The individual interim reports prepared for each project, as well as the
individual responses from the Texas Historical Commission (THC), are presented in
Appendix A.

The cultural resources investigations for each of the six projects consisted of an initial
archival review, an intensive cultural resources survey of each Project Area, the production of
interim reports submitted for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), and the
production of a final report for review by the SHPO in accordance with the THC’s Rules of
Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s
president) served as the projects’ principal investigator, while Jacob Lyons, Jared Wiersema,
McKinzie Froese, and Steven Schooler conducted the field investigations at various times in
2019.
The cultural resources surveys of the six Project Areas resulted in entirely negative
results. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the assessed locations or within
any of the excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the development of
the six projects would have no adverse effects on significant cultural resources designated as or
considered eligible for designation as SALs on GLO property. Horizon therefore recommended
that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects relative to the
jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including
human remains or burial features) were inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the various Project Areas, even in previously
surveyed areas, Horizon further recommended that all work at the location of the discovery
should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery. The THC
concurred with these recommendations for all six projects.
All recovered cultural materials (if any) and all original field notes, maps, drawings, and
photographs were to be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and Texas Administrative Code Title 13,
Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The six Anadarko projects on GLO land that were assessed in 2019 are all located in
northwestern and north-central Reeves County, Texas. One of the six projects is located in the
vicinity of Orla, Texas, and can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Threemile Draw, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The remaining five projects are located
west and south of Mentone, Texas, on the USGS 7.5-minute Anderson Ranch, Texas, Mentone
SW, Texas, and Sand Lake, Texas, topographic quadrangle maps (see Figure 1-1; also see
individual interim reports in Appendix A). The six projects include three pipeline ROWs, two well
pad expansions, and one new well pad with an associated access road ROW. Each of these
six projects is summarized in Table 2-1.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The six Project Areas are located within desert settings in West Texas. They are
typically found in relatively flat to gently undulating desert hills that are dissected by a variety of
drainages and draws, including Threemile Draw and tributaries of the Pecos River.
Representative images of the Project Areas are presented in Figures 2-1 through 2-4.
Hydrologically, all six of the Project Areas are situated within the Pecos River basin. All
are located to the west or southwest of the Pecos River and are drained to the east or northeast
by the various water channels listed above.

2.3

CLIMATE

Winters in Reeves County are generally cool, with an average temperature of
46.0 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are hot, with an average temperature of
83.0°F. The average annual total precipitation is about 8.6 inches (21.8 centimeters [cm]), with
roughly 70% of it falling between April and September (NRCS 1980).

FLORA AND FAUNA

The six Project Areas are located in the Chihuahuan Biotic Province, which includes all
of Trans-Pecos Texas except for the Guadalupe Mountains (Blair 1950).
Blair notes that
portions of Culberson and the surrounding counties, including Reeves, were once part of an old
bolson now drained by the Pecos River. Also located within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas
of the Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion, the Project Areas are situated on geologic formations
comprising sand sheet and caliche deposits (Griffith et al. 2007). Three native plant
communities dominate the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas: saline flats and alkaline playa
margins, gypsum land, and desert shrubland. The dominant species associated with the saline
flats and alkaline playa margins plant community include fourwing saltbush (Atriplex
canescens), seepweed (Suaeda spp.), pickleweed (Salicornia spp.), and alkali sacaton
(Sporobolus airoides). The dominant species associated with the gypsum land plant community
include gypsum grama (Bouteloua breviseta), blazingstar (Mentzelia spp.), and Torrey’s jointfir
(Ephedra torreyana). The dominant species associated with the desert shrubland plant
community include creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), American tarwort (Flourensia cernua),
yucca (Yucca spp.), sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia), blackbrush (Acacia rigidula), Christmas
cactus (Cylindropuntia leptocaulis), lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), and cenizo (Leucophyllum
frutescens) (Griffith et al. 2007).

3.0 REGIONAL HISTORY

3.1

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into three main periods: PaleoIndian (pre-8500
B.P.), Archaic (8500 to 1250 B.P.), and Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.). The Archaic period
is further subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.), the Middle Archaic (6000 B.P. to
3500 B.P.), and the Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.) subperiods.
3.1.1

PaleoIndian (pre-8500 B.P.)

The PaleoIndian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna such as mammoth and bison are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game such as deer and turtles were also likely
utilized as food items. Plant foods undoubtedly made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are considered low and probably consisted of small
family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the period may
suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band aggregation
for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in upland
tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and Folsom
points are indicative of Early PaleoIndian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the later span of
the period.
3.1.2

Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.)

Like the PaleoIndian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces

HJN 160006 AR 115

11

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

along tributary watercourses but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locale and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence strategies
in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter climates.
Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy, Hardin,
and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.
3.1.3

Middle Archaic (6000 to 3500 B.P.)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increased, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods, with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.
3.1.4

Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence was focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries as well as on clayey floodplains.
3.1.5

Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow, as
well as ceramics, in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued, with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic,
sites continue to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the recovery of
burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices also
suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.
3.1.6

Historic (250 B.P. to Present)

The history of Reeves County is not well documented, due to its remoteness and low
population. The Antonio de Espejo expedition was one of the first Spanish expeditions to cross
into West Texas. According to Smith (2017), this expedition encountered a group of three
Jumano Indians near Toyah Lake in eastern Reeves County in 1853. The Jumanos are said to
have irrigated crops of peaches and corn near Balmorhea (Smith 2017). Later visitors to the
region noted groups of Mescalero Indians growing corn along Toyah Creek. It wasn’t until the
1870s that the first Anglo farmers and ranchers began to settle the area.
Named for Confederate colonel George R. Reeves, Reeves County separated from
Pecos County in 1883 and was organized 1884. Around the turn of the twentieth century, state
law permitted sale of school lands in West Texas. This led to a rush of new settlers in the
region. By 1910, the population of the county had doubled to 4,392, with most residents living in

Projects on General Land Office Property in Reeves County, Texas

the numerous small towns that had sprung up, including Orla and Balmorhea, which were the
only two towns with remaining post offices in the 1990s (Smith 2017). The 1920s and 1930s
saw the expansion of oil exploration in the region, and the population increased to 6,407
residents. By the 1990s, the Reeves County economy was primarily based on oil and
agriculture. In the early 2000s, the population had increased to 14,349.

3.2

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The northwestern region of Reeves County has undergone extensive archeological
surveys in the last 60 years, with the majority having been completed since the mid-1980s.
Most of these archeological projects included Phase I and II subsurface investigations in
support of oil and gas extraction projects. These investigations were undertaken along pipeline
corridors and well pads for companies such as Anadarko, El Paso Natural Gas Company, and
Plains All American Pipeline. Archeological surveys were completed by environmental
engineering firms such as Horizon, SWCA, Inc., and Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations, as well as from academic institutions such as the Cultural Resource
Management Division from New Mexico State University.
The archeological sites recorded in Reeves County demonstrate a wide range of Native
American historic and prehistoric material culture, with noteworthy examples of skilled artistic
expression in both pictographs and petroglyphs, as well as in the form of richly decorated clay
vessels and other ritual and ceremonial objects depicted in media, such as exotic shell, bone, or
rare stone, including turquoise, malachite, and kaolinite (O’Laughlin and Black 2019). The
temporal range of these cultures spans from Paleoindian through the Archaic and into the
Contact period. Many of the sites consist of prehistoric lithic scatters, burned rock middens
containing fire-cracked rock (FCR), hearth features with faunal remains, and ceramic sherd
assemblages. The distinct archeological tradition Jornada Mogollon existed in the region from
roughly A.D. 400 to 1500 (Lehmer 1948). These peoples practiced sedentary lifeways, including
an emphasis on cultigen intensification of crops such as maize and squash. The Jornada
Mogollon, a part of the Pueblo complex, lived in pithouse villages (Whalen 1981) and produced
skilled ceramic techniques such as El Paso Polychrome, Chupadero Black-on-White, and
Playas Red incised (O’Laughlin 2001). All of these ceramic styles favor the Casas Grandes
(Paquime) culture artistic style to the south near Chihuahua, Mexico (Lehmer 1958). These
shared artistic types demonstrate extensive trade networks in and out of the Reeves County
area. Later historic tribes in the region included the Jumanos, Apache, and Comanches.
Reeves County contains several archeological sites which are exceptional and notable
to mention. Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric petroglyphs occur at the Graef Petroglyph Site in
Reeves County and just across the border in Loving County at site 41LV1, also known as
Jackson’s Petroglyph Site. The artistic style at Graef bears similarities to the Chihuahuan Desert
Abstract Style of the Late Archaic period, and includes depictions of geometric designs,
concentric circles, animals, and anthropomorphic figures. Site 41RV9 contains several Late
Prehistoric burials in a large rock cairn, and site 41RV49 contains seven Cornertang bifacial
knives and several temporally diagnostic projectile point styles, including Toyah, Frio, Langtry,
Paisano, Ensor, Guadalupe, and Carlsbad.

4.0 METHODOLOGY

4.1

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Prior to all field survey efforts, a Horizon archeologist conducted archival research via
the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database and via the National Park
Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer to
ascertain the number, type, and significance of any previously recorded archeological sites,
cemeteries, and historic properties within a 1.0-mile (1.6-kilometer [km]) radius of each of the six
Project Areas. Given the remoteness of the Project Areas and the general lack of prior surveys
in the area, five of the six Project Areas had no documented cultural resources within the 1.0mile (1.6 km) review perimeters. The results of the archival research conducted for each of the
six projects are presented within the associated interim reports in Appendix A.

4.2

FIELD METHODS

A one- to two-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed each of the six separate
Project Areas at various times in 2019. The survey efforts typically entailed intensive surface
inspection and subsurface shovel testing within each Project Area. For projects between
3.0 and 10.0 acres in size, which included most of the well pads, the Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of two shovel tests per acre.
For linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, which included all of the assessed
pipeline and access road ROWs, the TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile.
Horizon met or exceeded the TSMASS on all six Project Areas. The number of shovel tests
excavated within each Project Area are presented in Table 4-1. The specific methodology for
each of the six projects is presented within the associated interim reports in Appendix A. All
excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or
were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
For each project, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
shovel tests, and cultural materials observed (if any). Standardized shovel test forms were
completed for every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and
notations on any artifacts encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site
forms were to be completed and filed at TARL for permanent housing. Similarly, for any
previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed, updated site forms were to be
completed and filed at TARL.

A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld global positioning system (GPS) units
utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American
Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test locations and shovel test data are presented within the
associated interim reports in Appendix A.
All recovered cultural materials (if any) and all original field notes, maps, drawings, and
photographs were to be curated at TARL in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and
Conditions and Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

Based on the negative survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the development of
the six projects would have no adverse effects on significant cultural resources designated as or
considered eligible for designation as SALs on GLO property. Horizon therefore recommended
that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects relative to the
jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including
human remains or burial features) were inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the various Project Areas, even in previously
surveyed areas, Horizon further recommended that all work at the location of the discovery
should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery. The THC
concurred with these recommendations for all six projects. The THC comments for each of the
six separate Project Areas are presented in Table 5-2.

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Cholla State 2-4 3H Well Pad Expansion Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 8751
HJN 160006 AR 96

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Cholla State 2-4 3H
Well Pad Expansion Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 through 5). The
development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project Area is located
on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a
political subdivision of the state, the undertaking is regulated by the Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the Project
Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the Project Area on GLO land and, if any existed, to
determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered
eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the
cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit
number 8751.
Russell Brownlow (Horizon president) served as the Principal Investigator for the investigations
and author of this interim report. Steven (archeological subconsultant) conducted the field
investigations, while Jacob Lyons was responsible for the data compilation and figure drafting.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8751 during the 2019 calendar year. Subsequent to the approval of
the formal report, Horizon will also prepare all specimens, artifacts, materials, samples, and
original field notes, maps, drawings, and photographs for curation at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and
Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 5.9 miles (9.5 kilometers [km])
west of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Anderson Ranch, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of an
approximately 50.0 foot (15.2 meter [m]) expansion area surrounding all sides of the existing
6.1-acre Cholla State 2-4 1H well pad and access road rights-of-way (ROW). The new
expansion area comprising the Project Area totals approximately 1.3 acres in overall size.
During the construction efforts, the proposed expansion area ringing the existing well pad will
first be cleared and graded, and all vegetation will be removed from the surface. The area will
then be cut and filled to create a level pad expansion around the perimeter.
Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2019). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2019). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric lithic scatter. This
site, 41RV153, is located approximately 2.8 miles (4.5 km) southwest of the Project Area.
Based on the Atlas database, the existing Cholla State 2-4 1H well pad and access ROWs that
are encompassed by the current Project Area were assessed for cultural resources in 2016.
This prior survey, conducted by Horizon on behalf of Anadarko, produced negative results.
Soils
Only 1 soil type is mapped within the portions of the Project Area. This soil is summarized in
Table 1 (NRCS 1980) and presented Figure 6.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on a
terrace above tributaries of the Pecos River and Horsehead Draw, it was Horizon’s opinion prior
to the field efforts that there existed at least a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric
cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
Steven Schooler, a Horizon archeological subconsultant, assessed the Project Area on 2
February 2019. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 3 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 0 and 3.0 acres in size. As
the Project Area totals approximately 1.3 acres, a minimum of 4 shovel tests were necessary
within the Project Area to meet the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a
total of 5 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through
0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils
prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on
Figure 7. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.

Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
5 excavated shovel tests.
The field archeologist also noted that the vast majority of the Project Area had already
experienced some level of prior disturbance from the construction of the existing well pad that it
encompasses (see Figure 4). He also noted dense, argillic clay soils within the Project Area
that had a low potential for containing deeply buried, alluvial cultural deposits.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed Cholla State 2-4 3H Well Pad Expansion Project will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of
the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed
undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 8751 during the 2019 calendar year.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2019). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2019). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resources to the Project Area is a prehistoric lithic procurement
area. This site, 41RV114, is located approximately 2.0 miles (3.2 km) northeast of the Project
Area.
Soils
Only 1 soil type is mapped within the portions of the Project Area. This soil is summarized in
Table 1 (NRCS 1980) and presented Figure 6.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above an unnamed drainage linked to the Pecos River, it was Horizon’s
opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed a moderate potential for undocumented
prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.

HJN 160006 AR 98

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the portion of the Project Area on 12
February 2019. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the Project Area measures approximately 2504.0 feet (763.2 m) in length, a minimum
of 7 to 8 shovel tests were necessary within the Project Area to meet the TSMASS. Horizon
met the TSMASS by excavating a total of 7 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated
matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowelsorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated
shovel tests are presented on Figure 7. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
7 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the rerouted
alignment of the Thunderdome 54-4-24 Unit 1H Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline Project will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with
the development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within
the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of
the discovery.

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop a rerouted alignment of
the Kaycee State 57-3-33 Unit 2H-4H Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline right-of-way (ROW) in
Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 through 5). The development of the Project
Area will be privately funded. However, a portion of the Project Area is located on property
owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political
subdivision of the state, the portion of the undertaking on GLO land is regulated by the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources
survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area on GLO land and, if
any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites
considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon
conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
annual permit number 8751.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8751 during the 2019 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 9.0 miles (14.5 kilometers [km])
southwest of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Threemile Draw, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of separate
oil, gas, and salt water disposal pipelines all contained within one right-of-way (ROW) that

consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8751 during the 2019 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 6.0 miles (9.7 kilometers [km])
west of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Anderson Ranch, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of two
separate pipelines that will be colocated within one pipeline right-of-way (ROW) that measures

approximately 2100.0 feet (640.1 meters [m]) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide with a total area of
approximately 1.4 acres.
Its center point is located at Latitude 31.711096 and Longitude
-103.703490.
During the construction efforts, the proposed ROW will first be cleared and graded, and all
vegetation will be removed from the surface. The pipeline will be placed in a trench at a depth of
no less than 3.0 feet (0.9 m) between the top of the pipe and ground surface. After the pipeline
is installed, tested, and buried, the pipeline ROW will be reseeded with an appropriate seed mix
for the area.
Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of one previously
recorded archeological site within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area (THC 2019),
while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP
within the review perimeter (NPS 2019). The previously recorded archeological site and its
distance from the Project Area are summarized in Table 1, while its location relative to the
Project Area is presented in Figure 6. No documented cultural resources, including any listed
on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the Project Area. Based on the
Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have been undertaken within the
boundaries of the current Project Area.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on a
terrace adjacent to tributaries of the Pecos River and Horsehead Draw, it was Horizon’s opinion
prior to the field efforts that there existed at least a moderate potential for undocumented
prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A Horizon archeologist assessed the Project Area on 14 May 2019. This entailed intensive
surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for
linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the Project Area measures
approximately 2100.0 feet (640.1 m) in length, a minimum of 6 to 7 shovel tests were necessary
within the Project Area to meet the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a
total of 9 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through
0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils
prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on
Figure 8. Shovel test data are presented in Table 3.

Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
9 excavated shovel tests.
The majority of the shovel tests revealed deposits of reddish-brown silty clay on the surface and
throughout the excavated vertical extent of the shovel tests.
However, the two
southeasternmost shovel tests revealed reddish-brown silty clay loam as the proposed ROW
approached a depressional area. As noted above, all excavated shovel tests produced
negative results for subsurface cultural deposits.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Cholla
State 2-4 3H Flowline and Gas Lift Pipeline Projects will have no adverse effect on significant
cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon
therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of the Project
Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural
materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point

HJN 160006 AR 102
15 May 2019
Page 12

during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed undertaking,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 8751 during the 2019 calendar year.

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Thunderdome 54-4-24 Unit 1H-2H Pad Expansion Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 8751
HJN 160006 AR 106

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Thunderdome 54-4-24
Unit 1H-2H Pad Expansion Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 through
5). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project Area is
located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered
to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking is regulated by the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the
Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the Project Area on GLO land and, if any existed, to
determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered
eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the
cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit
number 8751.
Russell Brownlow (Horizon president) served as the Principal Investigator for the investigations
and author of this interim report. Jared Wiersema (Horizon project coordinator) conducted the
field investigations and was responsible for the data compilation and figure drafting.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8751 during the 2019 calendar year. Subsequent to the approval of
the formal report, Horizon will also prepare all specimens, artifacts, materials, samples, and
original field notes, maps, drawings, and photographs for curation at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and
Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 8.7 miles (14.0 kilometers [km])
southwest of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Mentone SW, Texas, and Sand Lake, Texas, topographic quadrangle maps. The Project Area
consists of a 0.4 acre extension on the existing Thunderdome 54-4-24 Unit 1H-2H Well Pad and
an associated access road that measures 932.5 feet (284.2 meters [m]) in length by 30.0 feet
(9.1 m) wide (approximately 0.6 acre). Overall the Project Area totals approximately 1.0 acre in
size.
Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2019). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2019). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric lithic procurement
area. This site, 41RV114, is located approximately 1.9 miles (3.1 km) northwest of the Project
Area.
Based on the Atlas database, no prior cultural resources surveys have been undertaken within
the boundaries of the current Project Area. However, the existing Thunderdome 54-4-24 Unit
1H-2H well pad to the west, southwest, and south of the current Project Area was assessed for
cultural resources by Horizon in 2018. This earlier survey, conducted under TAC annual permit
number 8397, produced negative results within the assessed area. In addition, Horizon also
assessed a linear pipeline corridor a short distance to the south of the current Project Area in
2017. This survey, conducted under TAC annual permit number 7883, also produced negative
results.
Soils
Only 1 soil type is mapped within the portions of the Project Area. This soil is summarized in
Table 1 (NRCS 1980) and presented Figure 6.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform between drainages linked to Sand Lake, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the
field efforts that there existed a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A Horizon archeologist surveyed the Project Area on 9 July 2019. This entailed intensive
surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 3 shovel tests per acre for
block acreage projects measuring between 0 and 2.0 acres in size. This equates to a minimum
of 1 shovel test within the 0.4-acre well pad extension portion of the Project Area. The TSMASS
also require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet
(30.5 m) in width. This equates to a minimum of 3 shovel tests along the 932.5 foot (284.2 m)
access road portion of the Project Area. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total
of 7 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are
presented on Figure 7. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.

Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
7 excavated shovel tests.
The field crew noted that the area consisted of a generally flat and featureless desert area with
a gravelly surface spotted with creosote brush. No visible water courses or lithic sources that
might have attracted a prehistoric presence at the location were observed.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
Thunderdome 54-4-24 Unit 1H-2H Pad Expansion Project will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.

cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed
undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.

Above-Ground Resources
• No historic properties are present or affected by the project as proposed. However, if historic properties are
discovered or unanticipated effects on historic properties are found, work should cease in the immediate area;
work can continue where no historic properties are present. Please contact the THC's History Programs Division
at 512-463-5853 to consult on further actions that may be necessary to protect historic properties.
Archeology Comments
• No effect on archeological sites. However, if buried cultural materials are encountered during construction or
disturbance activities, work should cease in the immediate area; work can continue where no cultural materials
are present. Please contact the THC's Archeology Division at 512-463-6096 to consult on further actions that
may be necessary to protect the cultural remains.
• THC/SHPO concurs with information provided.
• THC has comments on the draft report submitted to this office for review.
We have the following comments: The following comments need to be addressed in the Final Report, as well as with all
future Interim Reports: 1) Please use updated imagery when depicting the location of a project area. The current figures
(3 and 6) do not depict the project area in relation to the recently constructed transmission line or existing well pad as
seen on Google Earth; 2) please include a brief description of the project area's physiographic setting based on field
observations; and 3) there is no mention of previous surveys within the vicinity of the project area. For example, the
adjacent well pad was surveyed in 2018 under TAC Permit No. 8397.

Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Palmito Ranch 53-4-3 A 1H and B 2H Well Pad Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 8751
HJN 160006 AR 112

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Palmito Ranch 53-4-3
A 1H and B 2H Well Pad Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 through 5).
The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project Area is
located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered
to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking is regulated by the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the
Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the Project Area on GLO land and, if any existed, to
determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered
eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the
cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit
number 8751.
Russell Brownlow (Horizon president) served as the Principal Investigator for the investigations
and author of this interim report. Jacob Lyons (Horizon project archeologist) and McKinzie
Froese (Horizon archeological field technician) conducted the field investigations.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 8751 during the 2019 calendar year. Subsequent to the approval of
the formal report, Horizon will also prepare all specimens, artifacts, materials, samples, and
original field notes, maps, drawings, and photographs for curation at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and
Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.

Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 7.7 miles (12.4 kilometers [km])
south of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Sand Lake, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of: 1) a well pad
measuring approximately 6.8 acres in size; and 2) an access road totaling 991.0 feet (302.1
meters [m]) in length and 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide (0.7 acre). Overall, the Project Area totals
approximately 7.5 acres. Its center point is located at Latitude 31.594091 and Longitude -103.
589281.
According to Anadarko’s construction site manager, there is a slight elevation difference across
the pad area. As a result, pad construction will consist of clearing the area of all vegetation and
then cutting and filling to create a level well pad.
Archival Research
Database Review
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area
(THC 2019). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2019). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric lithic procurement
area. This site, 41RV97, is located approximately 2.3 miles (3.7 km) northeast of the Project
Area.
Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above a vegetated drainage, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field efforts
that there existed a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the
boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.

Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew surveyed the Project Area on 4 December 2019.
This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel tests. The
Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 2
shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 3.0 and 10.0 acres in size. This equates
to a minimum of 13 shovel tests within the 6.8-acre well pad portion of the Project Area. The
TSMASS also require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to
100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. This equates to a minimum of 3 shovel tests along the 991.0 feet
(302.1 m) access road portion of the Project Area. In all, a minimum of 16 shovel tests were
necessary within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the
TSMASS by excavating a total of 19 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated
matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowelsorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated
shovel tests are presented on Figure 7. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.

Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the observation of one crude,
bifacial specimen on the surface of the Project Area (Figures 8 and 9; see also Figure 7). This
specimen appears to represent a small core or tested cobble of white chalcedony that measures
roughly 2.3 inches (6.0 centimeters [cm]) long by 1.2 inches (3.0 cm) wide and 0.4 inch (1.0 cm)
thick. Numerous flakes have been removed from the fine-grained interior of the specimen, but
rough crystalized cortex remains on its ventral face. The lack of any additional refined flaking
suggests that it was abandoned during reduction rather than utilized as a formal tool.
Aside from this one isolated specimen, no other cultural materials were observed on the surface
of the Project Area or within any of the 19 excavated shovel tests that were excavated across
the Project Area. Due to its singular nature and the lack of other associated cultural materials,
the location of the isolated find was not documented as a formal archeological site.

The majority of the shovel tests revealed deposits of reddish-brown, gravelly, loamy silt on the
surface and throughout the excavated vertical extent of the shovel tests. This soil type across
the Project Area ranged between 3.9 and 27.6 inches (10.0 to 70.0 cm) thick, overlying
limestone bedrock. As noted above, all excavated shovel tests produced negative results for
subsurface cultural deposits.
Recommendations
Based on the survey results wherein only one isolated prehistoric specimen was observed in
surface contexts within the Project Area, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
Palmito Ranch 53-4-3 A 1H and B 2H Well Pad Project will have no adverse effect on significant
cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon
therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of the Project
Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural
materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point
during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed undertaking,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 8751 during the 2019 calendar year. Subsequent to the
approval of the formal report, Horizon will also prepare all specimens, artifacts, materials,
samples, and original field notes, maps, drawings, and photographs for curation at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and
Conditions and Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email me.
