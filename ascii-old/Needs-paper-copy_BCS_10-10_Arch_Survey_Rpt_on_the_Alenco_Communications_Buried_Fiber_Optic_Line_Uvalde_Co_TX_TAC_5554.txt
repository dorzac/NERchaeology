Abstract
An archeological survey of a proposed new buried fiber optic cable line was surveyed across
Uvalde County between February 12 and March 20, 2010 by James Briscoe (Senior
Archeologist), Glen Goode and Brian Rooney (Archeologists) of Briscoe/Szarka Consulting
Services. This project is being funded by the USDA as part of the Rural Utilities Servies Loan
Program as the ‘F’ loan. These investigations were conducted on behalf of Alenco
Communications, Inc. and N-Com, LLC, under TAC Permit Number 5554. The primary contact
for Alenco Communications, Inc. and N-Com is Robert Wilkerson, who can be reached at 6129
79th Street, Lubbock, Texas 79424, (806) 866-9900.
Alenco Communications, Inc. proposes to install a series of new fiber-optic lines in Uvalde
County, Texas. The new lines will replace existing buried copper telephone lines. The new lines
include sixty miles of buried cable. Each new line will be installed immediately adjacent to an
existing line along the edge of the public roadway, within the public right of way. The project
area is heavily developed and roadways are mostly improved paved roads with well contoured
drainage ditches. New lines will be installed by cable plow on a track mounted vehicle. The
Area of Potential Effect (APE) includes an eight foot wide surface disturbance corridor (the
width of the cable plow) along previously disturbed roadways. Sub-surface disturbance will
include a trench 3 inches wide and less than a meter deep. A total of less than seventy five acres
will be disturbed by the installation of the new cable. There will be no visual impacts, other than
temporary construction activity.
Preliminary surface reconnaissance of the entire project was conducted between February 12 and
20, 2010, to visually select areas with archeological and/or historical potential. Approximately
23 miles of the project (divided into 28 segments) were selected for examination along water
courses and terraces where there was judged to be a good likelihood of finding archeological
sites, as per consultation with the Texas Historical Commission. The archeological survey was
conducted between March 16 and 20, 2010. The archeological survey included pedestrian
examination of each selected segment, shovel testing in areas with surface soils and
communications with local residents about specific areas.
Twelve sites and two areas of historical interest were located in vicinity to the project. None of
these localities could be accessed outside of the public right of way (due to trespass issues).
Eleven of these sites have cultural material extending on to the road edge. In all cases,
archeological sites exposed along the public right of way have been severely impacted by
roadway and utility line construction. Three of the sites exposed along the roadway have some
integrity below surface disturbances and are being recommended for avoidance by rerouting or
tunnel boring. Two are historical localities which could only be viewed from the roadway. No
artifacts were collected during these investigations.

Sites 41UV481, 41UV483, 41UV487 and 41UV488 are either completely disturbed in the right
of way or are minor lithic scatters of little additional value. No further concerns are being
recommended for these localities. 41UV480 appears to be extremely disturbed by roadway
activity and deep chisel plowing (to 4 feet deep). 41UV482 and 41UV484 are being
recommended for avoidance by rerouting the new cable line away from the site areas. Deep
tunnel bores are being recommended for the cable line in the vicinity of 41UV486. 41UV490 is
located near but outside of the APE. 41UV485, 41UV489, the town of Chatfield and the
3

Traprock Mine are located sufficiently away from the project and will not be disturbed. The
Knippa Cemetery (a part of the town of Chatfield) is located close to the proposed new cable
line, which has been rerouted to specifically avoid any disturbances. The public right of way
bisects 41UV141 but has been down cut to a depth well below the site and installation of the new
cable line within the right of way will not disturb the site further. It is being recommended that
the project be allowed to proceed as planned.
This recommendation is subject to the approval of the Texas Historical Commission.

Introduction
Alenco Communications, Inc. proposes to install a series of new fiber-optic lines in Uvalde
County, Texas. The new lines will replace existing buried copper telephone lines. The new lines
include about sixty miles of buried cable. Each new line will be installed immediately adjacent
to an existing line along the edge of the public roadway. The project area is heavily developed
and roadways are mostly improved paved roads with well contoured drainage ditches. The new
cable line will be installed through areas with heavy surface disturbance. New lines will be
installed by cable plow on a track mounted vehicle. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) includes
an eight foot wide (the width of the cable plow) surface disturbance corridor along previously
disturbed roadways. Sub-surface disturbance will include a trench 3 inches wide and about one
meter deep. A total of less than seventy five acres will be disturbed by the installation of the new
cable. There will be no visual impacts, other than temporary construction activity. Steeper
slopes, roadways, existing utility lines and stream crossings will be tunnel bored. An
archeological survey of the proposed new buried fiber optic cable line was surveyed between
February 12 and March 20, 2010, by James Briscoe (Principle Investigator), Glen Goode and
Brian Rooney (archeologists) of Briscoe/Szarka Consulting Services.

Environmental Setting
Uvalde County is located in the south central portion of Texas. It covers 1,588 square miles and
is cut by the Nueces, Leona, Sabinal, Dry Frio, and Frio rivers, all of which are feeder drainages
of the Rio Grande River basin. There are two distinct environs in the region, the Edwards
Plateau which covers the northern third of the county and the Dissected Coastal Plain in the
southern two-thirds of the county. The Edwards Plateau rises around 500 feet above the Coastal
Plain and dominates the northern horizon throughout the region. The Dissected Coastal Plain
(surrounding the Project area) is located south of the Edwards Plateau and includes relatively flat
uplands dotted by a series of small conical hills identified as an extinct Mesozoic volcanic field,
now mostly buried beneath layers of younger Plio-Pleistocene sediments. Numerous basaltic
vents and outflows protrude from the uplands.

8

The uplands in the project area are a boulder and cobble field with outwash gravels from the
Edwards Plateau to the north. Water-worn cobbles of chert, limestone and various harder
minerals cover the surface in less-agriculturally modified areas and all major stream courses
have deep gravel beds. Soils in the Project Area are generally shallow deposits of limestone
loams (AKA black land prairie) with deep to shallow clay bed horizons over Plio-Pleistocene
outwash beds and bedrock. Active down-cutting along major streams has exposed bedrock with
generally deeper soils on terraces of sandy clay loam, calcium rich calcareous clay and
weathered gravel. Chert occurs throughout the region as outwash cobbles from pea gravel to
boulders in size.
Average annual rainfall for the area is approximately 23 inches and temperatures range from
40°F to 75°F in the winter and 65°F to 100°F in the summer. The low rolling hills that make up
the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau cover the northern and western portions of the county
with short grasses and scattered timber, while the southern and eastern portions of the county are
more plains-like with thorny vegetation and scattered oak. The majority of the project area has
been in cultivation since the nineteenth century and all areas of deeper soils have a distinct plow
zone surface and artificial irrigation accounts for two-thirds of the agricultural product of the
area. Many tracts of farm land have been allowed to revert to pasture and mesquite scrub in
recent decades.

Research Design and Methodology
Consultation was made with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) on January 12, 2010. THC
response was to have an archeologist examine all water crossings and areas of high potential of
containing archeological resources. All proposed cable line routes were plotted on topographic
quadrangle sheets and marked in areas of water crossings, prominent terraces, areas with
previous archeological studies and points of possible archeological interest. A windshield and
limited surface reconnaissance of the entire project was conducted in February to aide in the
selection of areas needing archeological survey. Twenty eight areas considered to have some or
good archeological potential were selected and located on topographic maps. These areas are
discussed further in the Segment Description section of this report. For archeological purposes,
a corridor 20 feet wide (roughly 51 acres) was included in the archeological investigations,
conducted between March 16 and 20, 2010. This includes the width of selected segments
between the existing roadway and private property boundaries on both sides of the road right of
ways. Areas outside of road right of ways were not physically examined due to trespass issues.
Field methodology included a pedestrian reconnaissance along the project corridor, with shovel
testing as deemed necessary. Areas adjacent to streams were tested to a meter deep (the limits of
the APE) where deposits extended to that depth. Each shovel test was a 30 X 30 cm hole, dug
through surface deposits. The majority of the project corridor had relatively shallow surface
deposits (with heavy surface impacts from roadway construction) and good to excellent surface
visibility. A Garmin hand held GPS receiver was used to spot locate each shovel test, surface
artifacts, and other points of interest located in the field. Fill from each shovel test was hand
sifted through 1/4 inch hardware.

Files Searches
A background search of Texas Historical Commission (THC) Atlas Records (on-line) records
was been completed prior to fieldwork. The entire project is located in or along the floodplains
and uplands terraces of the Frio River and several of its major tributaries. Historical maps were
also consulted for the area. Fort Inge was located near the area in 1847 and the 1855 map
indicates that the project area is along the Upper Presidio Road.

1847 Map of the project area (Jesse Olney)

1855 Map of the area (J. H. Colton)
(http://alabamamaps.ua.edu)

The Handbook of Texas Online was also consulted. According to those records, the adjoining
areas were granted to John McMullen and James McGloin in the 1820s. Several tracts were also
deeded to veterans of the Texas War for Independence. However, settlers did not really start to
arrive in numbers until after Fort Inge was created in 1847. At that time, Fort Inge was
connected to the rest of Texas by the Overland Southern Mail Route, which follows US Hwy 90
today. Uvalde County was created in 1850, but denied permanent county status due to the small
population (the county was officially recognized in 1856).
RW Black purchased a major portion (one league and one labor of land) of the McMullen and
McGloin land in Bexar County in 1853 and began laying out a town site near Fort Inge. Black
built a grist mill next to the military post and named the vicinity Encina. Black established a
new town site a mile north of the post the following year, to take advantage of the traffic along
the Del Rio to San Antonio Road. Encina (later called Uvalde) was made the county seat and
remains so today.
Smaller tracts were bought up by land speculators (including RW Black) along the Nueces, Frio
and Sabinal rivers as early as the 1840s but settlement was minimal until the 1850s. Most of the
original settlers were cattle ranchers. In 1870s ranch lands began being fenced and in 1881, the
Galveston, Harrisburg, and San Antonio Railroad extended lines into the area. Since that time
more industries, including the petroleum, gravel and asphalt industries, have also become
important to the county.

11

Cultural Setting
Uvalde County is located in south central Texas, roughly on the south edge of the central Texas
Edwards Plateau, east edge of the Rio Grande basin and northwest edge of the Coastal Plain.
Much of the archeological association attributed to the region comes from these areas where
there are well presented cultural sequences. The reader is referred to Perttula and Reese (1995),
Goode (2002) and Hoffman et al (1989) for detailed narratives about the cultural sequences of
the area. In general, the sequence for the region includes the Paleo-Indian (ca.11,200 years ago
to 7,500), Archaic (ca. 7,500 to 1,400 years ago), Late Prehistoric (ca. 1,400 to 400 years ago)
and Protohistoric (ca. 400 to 200 years ago) periods. The historical period for the region begins
about 200 years ago and ends with the modern period, beginning 45 to 50 years ago.
The Paleo-Indian period is generally seen as the time at the end of the last Ice Age when the first
people began arriving. The era had cooler and wetter conditions and smaller bands followed
herds of now extinct species. The Archaic stage sees warming and dryer conditions with small
to slightly larger groups beginning to exploit local resources more efficiently and the start of
regional differences in local cultures. The Late Prehistoric period sees the introduction of arrow
point technology and pottery but camp sites remain small and somewhat temporary. Villages
appear at the end of the period. The Protohistoric era begins more or less with the shipwreck of
Cabeza de Vaca and ends with the beginning of the Spanish Missions of the late seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. History specific to the project area is included in the Cultural Resources
section of this report.

Segment Descriptions
Segment 1
This segment runs for about 600 feet where FM 1049 crosses the Frio River. A waterhole on
Frio River, identified on the 1898 30-minute topographic map of the area as Black Waterhole, is
located on the north side of roadway approximately 100 feet away from the project area. The
river bed in this area is a dense gravel bar containing poor to good quality chert cobbles from 5
to 35 cm in size. Broken chert cobbles, surface piles of chert and steel hammer marks on some
specimens indicate a considerable amount of modern rock collecting in the area. However, no
recognizable prehistoric activity was noted along this segment of the project. No shovel tests
were dug along the segment due to extensive gravel outcrops across the bottoms.
The new cable line will be tunnel bored below the river.

Figure 4. Segment 1, looking east. Black Waterhole
on left edge of picture.

Segment 2
This segment runs for about 1600 feet along high ground along FM 1049 east of the Frio River.
The Moore Ranch (established in 1846) is located along this segment on the bluff above a bend
in the Frio River. The river has cut a steep bluff around the north/northwest side of the high
ground. A sandy knoll was also located on the east side of the high ground, facing an older
channel scar to the east. Aside from the sandy knoll, there was a lack of surface soils along the
roadway.
13

Limited shovel testing was dug along this section due to excellent surface exposure (over 80%)
and cut bank exposures. Moore Ranch (41UV485) and one prehistoric site (41UV486) were
located along this segment.
The new cable line will be tunnel bored along the ditch through the sandy knoll area.

Figure 6. Sandy knoll, looking west.

14

Segment 3
This segment covers approximately 200 feet around the intersection of a gravel county road and
Hwy 1023. This segment is a flatter uplands examined due to an extensive gravel outcrop in the
area. The start of Spring Branch begins at this point as a slight terrace drain. The gravel outcrop
has a good selection of chert throughout the area. Property fences are up to the edge of the
gravel roadway in this area. Shovel tests were not considered necessary for this area.
No cultural resources were located in this area.

Figure 7. Segment 3, looking north.

Segment 4
This segment runs for 5000 feet through the Chatfield Addition to the town of Knippa in this
area. The cable line begins at a south trending gravel road just west of Knippa Cemetery and
runs south for 400 feet along the west side of the road to an easterly trending gravel street, then
east along the south side of the street for 1800 feet to an intersection and then north along
another street for 400 feet to the south edge of US Hwy 90. Knippa Cemetery is located on the
south side of US Hwy 90 about 100 feet east of the south trending gravel road. The old town site
of Chatfield is located just east of the cemetery. The fiber optic line route was routed south on
the gravel road in order to avoid the cemetery and old town site of Chatfield. The cable route
runs past a worker’s community of mostly manufactured housing (prefabricated and trailer
houses). Road edges are graded and gravel appears to be local product from the river bed and
rock quarry nearby.
15

Shovel tests were not dug along this section due to excellent surface exposure (over 60%) and
private lawns extending to the edge of the street.
No artifacts aside from modern trash were located along this segment.

Figure 8. Cemetery along US Hwy 90, looking east.

Segment 5
This segment runs for three miles along the south edge of US Hwy 90 beginning from the east
side of Frio River, crossing the Frio and Dry Frio rivers and extending west to two small uplands
drainages. This segment includes the banks of the Frio and Dry Frio rivers and flat uplands to
the west. The roadway right of way has contoured drainage ditches bordered by plowed fields
next to the broad US 90 right of way. The area is 100% disturbed by roadway and utility line
construction. While the topographic map indicates a small drainage on the west end of the
segment, no sign of the drainage was located in area. The area is 100% disturbed by road
construction and modern quarry operations. Shovel tests were not excavated along the segment
due to extensive disturbances associated with roadway and utility line construction.
The Traprock Hill Mine rock quarry begins 150 feet south of the highway between the Frio and
Dry Frio rivers. This rock quarry is a historic quarry that has been in operation since 1880 or
earlier.

16

Segment 6
This segment runs for about two and a half miles along the east edge of Dry Frio River and
through a ridge between the Dry Frio (west) and Frio (east) rivers. The southern half of the
segment runs within 2 to 3 meters of the Dry Frio river bank (a steep drop of 3 meters). This
portion of the segment has half-meter deep road cuts on both sides of the improved roadway,
with surface soils extending deeper along the higher east side of the roadway along the south end
of the segment. There is a low knoll on the east side of the roadway near the south end with
deeper soil deposits that appears to be relatively intact. The northern half of the segment crosses
a flat upland between the two rivers to intersect with a paved road. Surface soil along the
northern half of the segment is sparse with small/shallow pockets of sandy silt loam amid dense
outwash gravels. Exotic animal fences are on both sides of road along the northern half of the
segment, immediately next to the gravel road. The area is 100% disturbed by roadway
construction and grading. A series of shovel tests were excavated along the southern portion of
the road (on the east side), where surface soil was located in the road cut.
41UV490 was located on the east side of the southern portion of the segment.

Figure 9. Segment 6, looking south.

17

Segment 6B
This segment runs for 4000 feet (east-west) along a county road around a Frio River Crossing.
There are cut bank approaches on either side of the river along the road. The cut banks extend
back about 150 feet and are 3 to 10 feet deep. A county gravel quarry is located in the river
gravel along the bottom. Shovel testing was not performed in this area due to extensive surface
gravel and construction disturbances.
The area is 100% disturbed and no archeological resources were located along this segment.

Figure 10. River crossing, looking east.

Segment 7
This segment is a continuation of Segment 6B for one mile between Segment 6B and the western
terminus of the line along a county road on a high terrace east of the Dry Frio River. Numerous
utilities lines are on both sides of the paved road. The drainage ditches are 1-3 feet deep between
pavement and exotic game fences on the edge of right of way. Shovel testing was not performed
in this area due to extensive surface construction disturbances and excellent surface visibility
(100%).
The area is 100% disturbed and no archeological resources were located along this segment.

18

Segment 8
This segment runs for 2600 feet along the edge of a bluff top on the east side of the Frio River.
Dense gravel and clay deposits are noticeable on the surface throughout this segment. The
graded roadway is a low swale (up to 3 feet deep) in the gravel deposits. A higher river terrace
rises to the northeast. There are numerous utility lines on either side and vegetation was sporadic
along the property fence lines on either side of the road. The area is 100% disturbed and no
archeological resources were located along this segment. Shovel tests were attempted but could
not be dug due to dense gravel deposits.
No cultural resources were located along this segment.

Figure 11. Segment 8, looking northerly.

19

Segment 9
This segment runs for 1300 feet along the edge of a swale of an older roadway parallel to the
present improved gravel roadway. The east side of the road rises onto a higher terrace edge, the
western side of the roadway drops onto the lower gravel terrace facing the Frio River, 300 feet to
the west. Cultivated fields border the older and newer roadways. The existing buried telephone
line runs along the east side of the two roadways, on the edge of the higher terrace to the east.
Artifacts and grader disturbance were noted along the east side of the two roadways. There is
some larger chert cobbles visible in the wheat field east of the cable line. No artifacts were noted
in the bean field west of the newer roadway. The artifact scatter was designated 41UV480, but
may well have been imported gravel along the older roadway.
Shovel testing along the edges of the right of way revealed 30 to 60 cm of mixed fill, crushed
limestone, caliche-like nodules and river gravel. This is underlain by calcareous clay of
unknown depth. A ranch hand indicated that the area was chisel plowed (generally 4 to 5 feet
deep) last spring.

Figure 12. Segment 9, looking southwest.

20

Segment 10
This segment runs for approximately 600 feet and is located near a minor seasonal drainage
(uplands run-off only) in flat uplands (Dinner Creek on the topographic quad). The area is a
bean field (50% ground exposure) and channelized in the area around the roadway. Shovel tests
were not considered necessary for this area. Very little surface gravel was noted in this area.
Extensive disturbance was noted along the county road right of way. Drainage ditches vary from
1 to 3 feet deep and have a dense clay base at the bottom on both sides of the roadway.
No archeological resources were located along this segment.

Figure 13. Segment 10, looking east.

21

Segment 11
Segment 11 runs for about 1200 feet and includes 300 feet at the end of a county road and along
a county improved driveway. This segment is located near a slight drop (10 feet) between the
end of the county roadway and Dinner Creek, 600 feet to east. The area is a relatively flat
uplands with plowed and bean fields on either side of the roadway. Very little surface gravel
was noted in the plowed fields on either side of dirt road. There was also a deep and wide
drainage ditch (up to 6 feet) between the roadway and edges of the plowed fields. Surface
visibility varied from 90 to 100% in this area and no shovel tests were considered necessary for
this segment. The area is 100% disturbed by roadway and utility line construction.
No archeological resources were located along this segment.

Segment 12
This segment runs for 600 feet and is located near a minor sculpted drainage at curve on
Highway 1049. The area generally consists of flat uplands with a bulldozer created terrace drain
between a dry culvert on the road and slightly lower elevation in a wheat field to the southeast
(elevation drops 10 feet in ¼ mile). Surface visibility was excellent (100%) along the segment
and shovel testing was not considered necessary for this area. Very little surface gravel was
noted in fields in this area. The area has been 100% disturbed by plowing, bull dozer sculpting
and utility lines along both sides of the roadway.
No archeological resources were located along this segment.

Figure 15. Segment 12, looking southeast.

23

Segment 13
This segment runs for 1000 feet across Dinner Creek. The water course in this area is a minor
seasonal drainage (uplands run-off only) in a flat uplands. The area has plowed fields on both
sides and surface visibility was excellent (100%). Shovel testing was not considered necessary
for this segment due to heavy disturbance and excellent surface visibility. Dinner Creek has
been channelized through the area. Drainage ditches on both sides of the road are from 1 to 3
feet deep and extend from the road surface to the property line. Very little surface gravel was
noted in this area. The area has extensive disturbance along the county road (100%).
No archeological resources were located along this segment.

Figure 16. Segment 13, looking east.

24

Segment 14
This segment runs for 300 feet and is located along a terrace above the east side of Blanco Creek,
200 feet to the west. The Kelley Ranch Site, 41UV484, is on a visible knoll south of the paved
country road. The north edge of this knoll is cut away for the drainage ditch and roadway. The
north edge of the roadway drops off sharply towards the creek to the north and northwest. Open
brushy pasture north of the roadway has a thin lens of surface soil and exposed surface gravel
with some quality chert cobbles present. The south side of the road cut has a deep drainage ditch
(to 3 feet deep) and an exposed profile of sandy loam deposits to a foot deep over a dense
compacted lens of gravel. Shovel tests were excavated along the edge of the drainage ditch on
the north side of the roadway, next to an existing buried cable line. Soils vary from 0 to 15 cm
deep of sandy loam to dense gravel deposits over calcaneous clay beds. The roadway right of
way has drainage ditches from the pavement to the property fences and is 100% disturbed.
The new cable line will run along the north edge of the roadway. No cultural resources were
located north of the roadway.

Figure 17. Segment 14, looking westerly.

25

Segment 15/16
This segment runs for 600 feet from Blanco Creek to the east to a property fence on the west.
Wish Cemetery, 41UV141, is located about 200 feet south of the paved county road in this area.
The limits of 41UV141 are being expanded to include the Wish Ranch complex that spans the
roadway (with the cemetery on the south edge of the site). The paved county road cuts through a
higher terrace in this area and the approach to Blanco Creek has been down cut as much as 10
feet deep. The present roadway was built on the south side of an earlier roadbed and the right of
way is 120 feet wide in the area. Extensive disturbance to the roadway provided excellent
surface visibility on both edges of the right of way (75-100%) and surface deposits on both sides
of the road include over a foot of sandy silt loam over calcaneous clay beds. Since no intact
surfaces existed on either side of the road cut, no shovel tests were considered necessary for this
area.
While there are visible traces of the ranch site north and south of the road, no artifacts or features
were present in the road cut. The new cable line will be installed in the older roadbed north of
the existing paved roadway.

Figure 18. Segment 15/16, looking east.
(note old roadbed on left side of drainage ditch)

26

Segment 17
This segment runs for 200 feet. The area is located on a higher uplands terrace west of Segment
16. A small uplands drainage is depicted on the current 7.5 minute topographic map of the area.
The right of way on the paved county road narrows from the east to 66 feet with deep drainage
ditches on either side of the roadway (to 4 feet deep). Sandy loam and small gravel deposits
about 1 foot deep were visible on road cut, over dense clay and gravel beds. The existing buried
cable line runs along the ditch on the north side of the roadway. Surface visibility varied from
50 to 100% in this area and no shovel tests were considered necessary for this segment. The
road right of way is 100% disturbed in this area.
No archeological resources were located along this segment. The new cable line will be installed
along the ditch on the north side of the roadway.

Figure 19. Segment 17, looking west.

27

Segment 18
This segment runs for 300 feet along a paved county road and for 300 feet north along an
intersecting gravel county road. The area is a low sloping uplands facing Dinner Creek to the
west. A 66 foot right of way on the paved county road has shallow drainage ditches on either
side of the road. The fence line on south side of the road is 3 feet above the level of the road and
the original road cut varies from 3 to 4 feet deep. The Dr. Wish Ranch is just north of the paved
roadway and west of the intersecting gravel road. The north trending gravel road has a 40 foot
right of way with narrow drainage ditches bordered by the gravel roadbed and property fences on
both sides. Surface visibility varied from 50 to 100% in this area and no shovel tests were
considered necessary for this segment.
No artifacts or features were located along the roadways along this segment.

Figure 20. Segment 18, looking southwest.

28

Segment 19
This segment runs along US 90 for a half-mile and crosses Dinner Creek. The stream has been
channelized around and through the railroad and highway right of ways, across an otherwise flat
uplands plain. Dense mesquite trees are located south of the highway and plowed fields are
north of the railroad. The right of way is extremely wide (300 feet) with a stream mechanically
channeled in this area. There is 100% disturbance in the area and no shovel testing was
determined to be necessary for the segment.
No archeological resources were located along this segment.

Figure 21. Segment 19, looking northeast.

29

Segment 20
This segment runs for 400 feet northerly along an improved gravel county road running along a
high terrace on the west/southwest side of an old channel of Blanco Creek. A driveway of a
private residence with locked gate extends north of the road intersection on the terrace. There
are deep road cuts and drainage ditches (up to 6 feet deep) along an intersecting east-west paved
road. A fence line runs on the east side of the north to south gravel road and an open plowed
field is located on the west side of the gravel road. Soils in the bank cut along the terrace include
a shallow lens of dark bright of sandy clay loam and gravel (to 20 cm deep) over dense clay.
Surface gravel was prevalent throughout the area. Surface visibility was excellent along the
segment (100%) and shovel testing was not considered necessary. One shovel test was,
however, attempted near the intersection of the two roads. This test confirmed the visual
information along the road cut.
41UV481 was located along the terrace east of the project area. No cultural resources were
noted in the immediate project area.

Figure 22. Segment 20, looking south.

30

Segment 21
This segment runs for 600 feet along an east-west improved gravel county road and includes
terraces and a road crossing on Blanco Creek. The road cut through the terraces is wide and
deep (100 feet wide, 5 to 20 feet deep) on either side of crossing. The terrace on northwest side
of the crossing was fenced and could not be physically examined, but very deep sandy deposits
and artifacts exposed in the road cut were observed from the roadway. Artifacts noted on the
east side of the crossing appear to be eroded from the terrace top. Soils on the east terrace
(across fence) appear to be thin deposits of sandy loam and typical gravel for the area, over dense
clay and gravel that do not appear to be typical of the area. A variety of materials in the lower
gravel and clay include coral fossils, sandstone and larger angular fragments. The geoarcheologist for BCS suggests that these could be tsunami deposits from the K-T Boundary
Event. The existing cable runs along the road cut which is 100% disturbed. Surface visibility
along the roadway was excellent (100%) and no shovel tests were excavated along the road cut.
41UV488 was located along this segment. The new cable line will be installed in the bottom of
the drainage ditch across this segment.

Figure 23. Segment 21, looking west.

31

Segment 22
This segment runs for about 900 feet along Highway 1049. The highway has sloped ditches on
either side (200 feet wide), with numerous utility lines in the road cut on both sides. The west
side of the road cuts into a low knoll between the road and has a sharp bend in the Frio River,
200 feet to the west. Artifacts were noted in the road cut on the west side of the road along the
length of the knoll. Shovel tests along the edge of the right of way show a thin surface lens of
sandy silt and silt clay loam between 10 and 15 cm deep, which appears to be the cultural layer
of the site. No cultural material was recovered from the shovel tests. A side road between the
highway and the river cuts across the top of the knoll and was spot checked. Artifacts appear to
be more common closer to the river along the length of the knoll. The site of the Schecklemagen
Ranch (depicted on the 1898 topographic map of the area) was also noted on the north end of the
knoll (about 150 feet west of the highway). This side of the road is over a meter lower than the
west side and an older channel line is visible a short distance to the east. Soils in this area are
sandier silt loam deposits, which are more disturbed by utility line construction and a series of
modern houses next to the roadway. The new buried cable line will be installed along the east
side of the road and will not disturb the site west of the road.
The site west of the road has been designated as 41UV482. The new line runs along the east side
of the highway, through an area 100% disturbed by roadway and utility line construction.

Figure 24. Segment 22, west side of road, looking south.

32

Segment 23/24/25
The segment runs for approximately 4300 feet along Highway 1049, next to a seasonal uplands
drainage. The roadway crosses a small terrace next to a channelized stream. Small scatters of
gravel were noted in the plowed fields and a pasture on the west side of the current drainage.
Soil in the road cut includes less than 4 inches of dark clay loam and road fill gravel over dense
black clay. A small culvert crosses the road near the south end of the segment and has created a
low wet area on the northeast side of the road. The ditch on this side of the road runs from the
pavement to the fence and is between 2 and 3 feet deep. No intact soils exist in the area The
roadway is essentially 100% disturbed in this area. No shovel tests were excavated along this
segment due to excellent surface visibility and the disturbed nature of the area.
No archeological resources were located along this segment.

Figure 25. South end of the segment, looking southeast.

33

Segment 26
This segment runs south for about a mile along a private driveway to an exotic game hunting
preserve. The stream course is over grown over with trees and brush (with visible dozer push
piles). The driveway runs along flat uplands about 100 feet east of the drainage. This area has
been heavily impacted by bulldozer clearing and the addition of crushed gravel on the roadway.
The new buried cable line runs along the east edge of the private drive, next to an existing cable
line. The area is essentially 100% disturbed by roadway construction and land clearing. No
shovel tests were excavated along this segment due to excellent surface visibility and the
disturbed nature of the area.
No archeological resources were located along this segment.

Figure 26. Segment 26, looking north.
(note bull dozer piles to right of roadway)

34

Segment 27
This segment runs for 1200 feet along Highway 1023 and includes low terraces on the east and
west sides of Long Hollow, a well-developed uplands drainage. Chert was thinly scattered in the
fields throughout the area and concentrated on a slightly higher terrace southeast of the
creek/road crossing. Soils throughout the area are thin (to 4 inches/10 cm deep) deposits of
bright of wayn clay loam over dense clay beds, with gravel along the channel. The drainage
ditches along both sides of the creek are shallow (to 2 feet deep), at the bottom of a 2 to 4 foot
deep roadway cut. The road cut extends from the road edge to the property fences on either side.
Artifacts were observed along the fence line on the terrace southeast of the creek crossing. The
road cut is about 2 feet deep in this area and is essentially 100% disturbed. No shovel tests were
excavated along this segment due to excellent surface visibility and the disturbed nature of the
area.
41UV483 was designated for the cultural material visible south of the roadway.

Figure 27. Segment 27 and 41UV483, looking east and southeast.

35

Segment 28
This segment runs for a quarter of a mile along the south side of US Hwy 90 and south for a
quarter of a mile along a gravel country road. The line runs next to a small ridge that contains a
massive outcrop of local chert and limestone gravel, over exotic materials and dense clay (see
area 21, 2 miles to the north) that could be K-T Boundary Event tsunami deposits. These are
most evident in the road cut along the south side of US Hwy 90 (across from a rest area). The
area is bordered by the highway on the north, the small county road on the east and a small
drainage to the west and south is considered to be one large archeological site. Flakes (primarily
decoration), tested cobble, used fragments, and scattered fire cracked rocks (basalt, silicified
sandstone, aggregate, and chert) were noted along the edge of the right of way. The fence on the
west side of the county road is set back 30 feet from the edge of the gravel/road swale but has
been stripped of surface soil. Gravel is in site along this strip and contains a quantity of quality
chert cobbles and artifacts embedded in a pavement-like surface. The existing coble line runs
along the edge of a graded roadbed which is generally about a foot lower than the strip next to
the roadway in this area. The highway right of way is extremely wide on the north side of the
“site” area and has cut the knoll from 3 to 20 feet deep. The existing cable runs along the south
edge of the road cut and both areas are 100% impacted by road construction. There are no
minimally or undisturbed deposits along the length of the cable line. Shovel testing was
impossible along the roadway, due to dense surface gravel and clay deposits.
The site has been designated 41UV487.

Results of Field Investigations
Twelve sites and two historical localities were located during these investigations

Wish Ranch, 41UV141
The cemetery at the Wish Ranch was originally recorded by J. Warren in 1989. Warren
mentions the stone cistern and well base in his site form for the cemetery but does not include the
ranch features as part of the site recorded. The Wish Ranch is located on the higher terrace on
the west side of Blanco Creek, about a quarter mile due west of Kelley Ranch. The ranch is
depicted as a group of buildings at the intersection of two roads on the 1898 30-minute
quadrangle for the area. Current visible remains of the site include a fenced cemetery, a
fieldstone cistern structure, a windmill base of fieldstone and a small garage or ranch shed across
the road to the north. The modern Highway 1023 bisects the ranch (east-west) and an improved
gravel county road runs south along the east edge of the property atop the terrace of Blanco
Creek. Highway 1023 has been considerably widened and deeply cut for the west approach to
Blanco Creek. The new roadway runs on the south side of an older roadbed. The site was only
observed from the roadway due to several no trespass signs along the fence.

Figure 29. Section of the 1898 topographic map.

37

Figure 30. Two views of ranch structures (looking south and north from the roadway).
The Wish Ranch was established in 1869 when 380 acres of the R P Kelley Ranch was deeded to
Casper Wish (by mortgage). Several additional properties either bordering or near the tract were
added over the next 15 years. The Uvalde Court Clerks Records show Mr. Wish as Casper or
Jasper in several deeds and it is unclear if the properties were being purchased by brothers or
other relatives with similar names, or if the name Casper is just simply misspelled in some of the
records. Casper Wish is buried in the cemetery on the property. Casper was the son of Thursey
Wish, who had taken a large patent on 1280 acres along the Sabinal River in 1847. It is
presumed that Casper was purchasing his own land after returning to the area after the Civil War.
In 1883 Casper sold the Sabinal property to the Johnson and Mathew Cattle Company and a
smaller tract about a mile west of Wish Ranch to his son, John L. Wish. Casper died in 1888 and
is buried next to his wife (1893) and a daughter (1893) on the ranch. The heirs of Casper Wish
began liquidating much of the property in the 1890s and today the land is owned by the Robert
Reagan Trust.
The Wish Cemetery is located about 200 feet south of the present Highway 1023, on the west
side of the county road and includes 3 graves in a fenced enclosure. Casper Wish (1824 to 1888)
is buried in the center, with his wife Nancy (1834-1893) on the north side and a daughter J.A.
Modal (1861-1890) on the south side of his grave. All three graves have substantial markers and
are well maintained by the current land owner. A large stone blockhouse-like cistern is located
north of the cemetery, about 75 feet south of the present highway. The fieldstone base of a
windmill just north of the larger stone structure has a modern galvanized steel windmill atop it.
A trailer house has been installed next to the two stone structures in recent years. The only other
evidence of the old ranch (visible from the roadway) is a garage-sized frame building across the
road to the north of the stone structures, inside a 4-M Ranch gate. No period artifacts were noted
along the road cut on either side of the road right of way.

38

Figure 31. Wish Cemetery, looking west from the county road.
The Wish Ranch is primarily an archeological site and probably does contain features relating to
the domestic life and the ranching industry after the Civil War. The site could qualify for
inclusion to the NRHP under Criteria A (for its connection to local history), Criteria C (for the
stone cistern on the site) and Criteria D (for the probable historical features important to our
understanding of post-war life ways), pending further local research.

41UV480, Area 9
This is an extremely disturbed lithic scatter/probable camp located on the edge of a high terrace
facing Rio Frio to the west. Archeological inspection was confined to the road right of way due
to trespass issues and the character and the extent of the site remains unknown. The high terrace
rises 10 to 20 feet above the floodplain terrace next to the river, which drops sharply another 20
feet to the active river bed. Cultural material (flakes, preforms and fire cracked rocks) was noted
for about 400 meters along an unimproved two track on the east side of an improved gravel
county road (CR346) along the west edge of a higher terrace. Deep ruts along the two-track road
(an older alignment for the county road) and shovel testing show Uvalde series silt clay loam
deposits, inter-mixed with crushed road gravel to an estimated 50cm deep (in deeper ruts) over
dense clay beds. The present county road runs roughly along the west edge of the higher terrace
and appears to mark the edge of the site (as no artifacts were located along the wheat field west
to the road). The artifacts could possibly be material brought in for gravel along the older
roadway but the high ground to the east suggests a possible encampment in the area.
An existing buried telephone cable line runs along a narrow strip between the unimproved road,
10 feet to the west and a wheat field immediately to the east. Flakes and fire cracked rocks were
noted extending easterly from the cable line into the plowed wheat field to the east. No cultural
material was noted in the lower area west of the two roads. Lacking access to private property
adjacent to the public roadway limits what can be said about the site. The character and
significance of the site remains pending.

Figure 33. 41UV480, looking north.

Figure 34. 41UV480, site sketch.

41

41UV481, Area 20
This is a possible prehistoric camp site located along a small (30 x100 meter) terrace spur of a
second terrace on the west side of Blanco Creek. Flakes (5 blank or core flakes and 3 decoration
flakes) and two fire cracked rocks were noted along the upper edge of the road cut along the
northern edge of the terrace spur. Access to private property adjacent to the public right of way
could not be arranged and details about the site are minimal.
The ditch along CR342 (east-west) has deep drainage ditches (50 to 180 cm deep) on either side
of a built-up paved roadway and shows a layer of surface soil (sandy) Knippa clay loam (0-14cm
deep) over bright of grey calcareous clay (to 28cm deep) over lighter bright of grey dense clay.
Outwash gravel was noted as sporadically scattered across the surface of the pastures on either
side of the roadway. CR384 cuts across the west edge of the terrace (north-south) and no
artifacts were noted along this area.
Blanco Creek has been channelized away from its original bed a short distance to the east
according to the 1898 30-minute topographic map of the area. The 1898 topo map also shows a
road running around the southern edge of the terrace spur which is still visible on the USDASCS aerial (Uvalde County, Sheet 46).
An assessment of the potential significance of this site cannot be made on the basis of limited
surface examinations.

Figure 35. 41UV481, looking southwest.

Figure 36. 41UV481 sketch.

43

41UV482, Area 22
This is a prehistoric camp or village located on a knoll on the east side of a sharp bend in the Frio
River. Highway 1049 (FM1049) cuts into the east edge of the knoll and site area for about 200
meters on the west side of the roadway. The east side of the roadway drops off to an older
channel run and floods with spring rains. Access to private property could not be secured in the
site area and all observations were made from the edge of the public right of way along the
highway and two improved county roads that cross the knoll (west of the highway). Artifacts
were prevalent along the upper edge of the road cut on Highway 1049 and adjacent to two
graded gravel roads that cross the knoll. Artifacts include fire cracked chert and basaltic rocks,
core and thinning flakes and angular cobble fragments along the upper 10 to 25cm of surface
deposits. Highway 1049 has a base layer of crushed rock and some of the flake-like fragments
and cobble fragments may be modern mechanofacts from road construction.
Soils along the knoll are Atco series with a gray bright of wayn and gravel sand-silt loam about
10 cm thick along the highway road cut, over a layer of lighter gray bright of wayn calcaneous
clay loam to about 20-25 cm deep, over dense gray clay to unknown depth. All artifacts appear
to be eroding from the upper sandy silt and gravel deposits, but may also be present in the
underlying clay loam. The slope of the highway road cut and extent of mechanical disturbances
(to a meter deep) makes surface observations difficult.
Highway 1049 was rebuilt in recent years (expanded to the west) and was cut on the west side
(into the edge of the knoll) and filled on the east side (onto the lower wet lands). There are at
least six utility lines along the roadway, including water and buried phone lines on both sides, a
natural gas pipeline on the west side and a power line on the east side of the road.
It is presumed, from surface examinations along the highway and spot checks along the gravel
roads that cross the knoll, that the site covers the entire 250 x 500 meter knoll between the river
and highway. Lack of access to private property, however, limits assessment of the character
and significance of this site.

44

Figure 37. Disturbances in the site area, looking south.

Figure 38. 41UV482, site sketch.
45

41UV483, Area 27
This is a probable lithic procurement area and small workshop located next to Highway 1023, on
the east side of Long Hollow Creek. Access to private property next to the public right of way
could not be secured and all observations of the site were made from the edge of the roadway.
Long Hollow Creek has been channelized in this area and rerouted to a linear ditch 60 meters
east of the old channel run. There is a low knoll immediately east of the new channel run.
Gravel is extremely dense atop the lower part of the knoll with visible tested and fractured chert
cobbles (some to 30cm across) over an estimated 50 x100 meter area. The road cut on the south
side of Highway 1023 has cut into the gravel deposit (to 30cm deep) and several decortication
flakes and tested cobbles were noted on the edge of the right of way. The terrace rises to the east
of the gravel outcrop and has a sandy clay loam surface soil (Knippa A/B) about 30 to 50 cm
deep over dense clay beds. A brushy pasture south of the roadway obscures surface material in
the area, except along a cleared portion near the rechannelized stream.
No non-workshop related cultural material was noted along the road cut, but observations from
the roadway are inadequate towards assessing the character or potential significance of the site.
No artifacts were noted on the north edge of the road right of way and the area is 100% disturbed
by prior construction activities.

Figure 39. 41UV483, cleared portion of the knoll, looking south.

46

Kelley Ranch, 41UV484
This is an unknown prehistoric camp site and early-day Texas ranch site located on a low knoll
on the east side of Blanco Creek. The knoll covers about 100 x 100 meters on the south side of
Highway 1023 and is dominated by an older occupied 1 ½ story house. Observation of the site
was confined to the road right of way and the property was clearly marked with no trespassing
signs. Prehistoric material (and some historical material) was prevalent around a driveway turnout on the north edge of the knoll and property. The landform drops off sharply to the north and
the road cut is over a meter deep next to the knoll. Sandy loam surface soil observed on the
knoll is absent from the roadway area (atop a dense deposit of outwash gravel) north of the
roadway. The roadway on the north side of the knoll has been severely impacted by graded
drainage ditches and several buried and overhead utility lines.
The prehistoric component consists of flakes, cobble fragments, several biface fragments and
possible fire cracked chert cobbles around the driveway turn-out on the south side of the right of
way. Sandy surface soil is mostly eroded away from the driveway area and deposits there are
deflated to pockets of sandy soil (to 5cm deep) over exposed gravel beds. Although no
diagnostics were located in the area (due to access restrictions) the general appearance of the
flaked bifaces and flakes suggests the site may be Late Archaic related. No evidence of
prehistoric artifacts or activity was noted in the right of way ditches on either side of the road.

Figure . 41UV484, surface artifacts in the driveway turn-out.
The historic component is the remnants of the Kelley Ranch homestead established in 1856.
R.P. Kelley acquired the property from the Gorgia and Greggoro Esperanza Family (an original
Donation Land Warrant from the 1840s, for Greggoro’s service to the State and Republic of
Texas). The heirs of Esperanza lived in San Antonio at the time and probably never saw the
property. R.P. Kelley, at about this time was acquiring numerous tracts of land in the newly
founded Uvalde County area (between the Sabinal and Frio Rivers).

47

In 1869, Kelley began selling off excess lands, including the land across Blanco Creek where
Casper Wish established his ranching operation. In 1883 Kelley sold the bulk of his holdings in
the area to Scottish investors (the Scottish American Mortgage Company) who were heavily
investing in the cattle industry at the time. Kelley retained his home place and erected a new
house there (believed to be the house still standing) in the 1880s. During the early 1900s the
property passed through several owners and the current owners are the estate trust of William C.
Reagan Jr.
The structure is a complex cross-gabbled craftsman house with classic revival elements and
several modern add-ons (including a plywood porch room). The roof is tin/asphalt and shake
shingle and the windows are hung 1/1 sash type (probably original) under modern storm
windows. The doors appear to be modern glass and composites. One of two center gable
chimneys (brick) remains and appears to be modified. The foundation is shaped cement blocks
(painted white) and siding is beaded lap board with scale shake gable ends.

Figure 41. 41UV484, two views of the Kelley Ranch from the public right of way.

For the most part, the structure retains much of its historical fabric. The house site is situated in
the center of the knoll south of the roadway and there are numerous linear and rectangular
disturbances and vegetation changes in the yard around it (possibly earlier structures and
features). One small simple frame utility shed exists just southward of the house and the remains
of a barn and a concrete water tank are located west of the house lot.

48

There were a number of historical artifacts noted in the driveway turn-out between the road and
property fence, 30 feet north of the house. Aqua pane and bottle glass, 2 whiteware sherds, 1
Bristol crockery sherd, 2 white ironstone sherds, several machine-made wire nails, 1 frame
screw, several red brick fragments and numerous can fragments (2 with flood seam lids) were
noted in driveway turn-out. The style of the structure and artifacts in the driveway turn-out all
appear to date roughly 1880 to World War I, which coincides with Kelley’s sell-off of the
ranching business in the 1880s.
The prehistoric component may or may not have significant cultural resources on the less
disturbed private property next to the right of way. While the Kelley House retains much of its
historical structural fabric, its present condition and appearance does not appear to be eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP, under Criteria C. The locality could, however, qualify for inclusion
under Criteria A (as an early-day ranch) and D (for features and material cultural information),
pending further research.

This is a larger multi-generational family ranch established by the Moore Family around 1847.
The complex is located atop a small bluff inside a sharp bend in the Rio Frio. State Highway
FM1023 runs around the north and west sides of the complex of modern and older ranch
structures visible from the roadway. The ranch complex proper could not be accessed during
these investigations, due to trespass issues outside of the project corridor and no evidence of the
site (artifacts, etc.) were noted along the highway right of way. The complex, as visible on
recent aerial satellite photography (http://www.bing.com/maps/) shows at least 17 structures and
surface disturbances of at least 7 other structures and/or activity areas on the 800x400 meter
bluff top. Three roads are shown converging on the site on the 1898 30 minute Uvalde
quadrangle map, above a river lake identified as Black Waterhole.

Moore Ranch II Site.
Local history does not mention the ranch and courthouse records were helpful only in tracing
ownership of the property between 1846 and 1912 and 1990 to the present. The tract of land
covers 1280 acres on the east side of the Rio Frio (UCCR Book I, page 42) and was taken up by
RF Roberts around 1840, who at the time was buying up the majority of the western district of
Bexar Country (later to become Uvalde County). Roberts transferred the title of the property to
JH Cartwright in 1847 year (by assignment). Mrs. Cartwright (Nancy) was a daughter of
Roberts and the couple lived in the recently established town of Uvalde.

50

The tract of land passed through several owners (William Lindsey in 1849, Sauders in 1850,
Friday in 1882 and the Firm of Stein and Schwartz in 1882) before being sold to Alex Moore
(first name unreadable on the deed) in 1882. Moore filed a patent from the State of Texas in
1882 (UCCR Book I, page 48) and established a home there in 1882 or 1883. In 1883, Moore
partnered with a backer named Evans (possibly a Scottish investor) who jointly acquired several
large tracts in Uvalde County for the Moore and Evans Cattle Company. Descendents of the
Moore Family continue to own the property as the WRT Trust (UCCR Book 306, page 581).
The ranch was recorded on 2/20/10 and included only surface observations from the roadway
north of the site. One older frame structure is located near the center of the complex, about 150
meters south of the fence line, and is believed to be the oldest surviving structure on the site.
The ‘house’ is a simple hall and parlor 1 ½ story structure with numerous later additions, with
one older (remodeled) chimney on the west end. The current roof is asphalt shingle, and
aluminum storm doors and windows have replaced the old wooden elements.

It is unclear when the first structures were built on the property, which could have been as early
as the 1840s. The complex, pending further local research, could be eligible for inclusion to the
NRHP, under Criteria A (for its role in developing the nineteenth century cattle industry in
Texas), Criteria C (as a good example of a surviving nineteenth century ranch complex), and
possibly Criteria D, as it undoubtedly holds numerous nineteenth and twentieth century
archeological features that could enhance our understanding of early-day ranching in this area of
Texas.

Moore Ranch 2, 41UV486
This is a prehistoric camp site located on a knoll on the east end of a bluff above a bend in the
Rio Frio. Highway 1023 bisects the knoll linearly and has removed over two-thirds of the site
area with a broad (75 meters) and deep (3 meters) road cut through the center of the site. The
knoll is capped by a sterile 30cm thick sandy loam (sterile) deposit, atop a cultural deposit
extending to 1 meter deep, over calcaneous clay to the base of the road cut. Artifacts are
actively being eroding from the cultural deposit and include flakes, biface fragments, informal
and modified flake tools, a sandstone mano fragment and fire cracked rocks. One cluster of fire
cracked chert and basaltic rocks, 32cm wide, was noted in the road cut on the north side and
several more disturbed slight concentrations along both sides of the road cut all appear to be
burnt rock features (fire pits).
For the most part, remaining cultural deposits appear to be intact and have at least one relatively
intact feature present. The site appears to meet the minimum criteria for inclusion to the NRHP
(Criteria D) as a location containing useful archeological information.
There are at least 2 buried cable lines (on either side of the roadway), an above ground power
line and a water line along the edge of the public right of way. The new cable line will be tunnel
bored beneath the ditch in this area and will not impact the site.

The Rest Stop Site, 41UV487
This site was located along Area 28 (Blanco Lake quad) which runs for a quarter of a mile along
the south side of US 90 and south for a quarter of a mile along a gravel country road (CR 306).
A small but prominent ridge in the area contains a massive outcrop of local chert and limestone
gravel, over exotic materials and dense clay that could be K-T Tsunami deposits. These are most
evident in the road cut along the south side of US 90 (across from a rest area). The area bordered
by US 90 on the north, the small county road on the east and a small drainage to the west and
south is considered to be one large archeological site, covering about a 40-acre area. Flakes
(primarily decoration), tested cobbles, use modified fragments, and scattered fire cracked rocks
(basalt, silicified sandstone, aggregate, and chert) were noted along the edge of the right of way.
The fence on the west side of the county road is set back 30 feet from the edge of the gravel/road
swale but has been stripped of surface soil. Gravel is in situ along this strip and contains a
quantity of quality chert cobbles and artifacts embedded in a desert pavement-like surface.
Observations of the high ground to the west of the county road were able to spot numerous flakes
and occasional fire cracked rocks on the surface (pasture with 50-75% ground cover). Modern
gravel quarries were visible atop the ridge. The higher part of the landform currently has
younger looking regrowth oak trees and large piles of field rock. Along Hwy 90 on the north
edge of the landform, the high ground drops off sharply to a lower stream terrace next to the
seasonal drainage. The lower terrace area has a dense outcrop of chert and limestone cobbles
immediately south of the roadway fence. Tested and broken cobbles were visible in the outcrop
from the fence line.

along highway road cut.

The highway right of way is extremely wide on the north side of the “site” area and has cut the
north edge of the knoll from 3 to 20 feet deep. The site appears to merit further investigations.

The Tsunami Site, 41UV488
This site was noted while examining the cut banks and crossing on Blanco Creek for a fiber optic
line that parallel an existing line on the north side of a gravel county road (CR 341). The cut
banks along the roadway are 50% wider than the roadway east and west of the creek. The cut
bank on the west side of the road shows a profile of over 1.3 meters of fine loam deposits
(Conalb loam) over a gravel lens to 2 meters deep, over dense light colored clay and gravel. The
terrace on the west side of the crossing has a vertical drop of about 3 meters facing the creek
channel. The undisturbed portions of the terrace on west side of the crossing were across a
property fence and could not be adequately examined. Artifacts observed in the cut bank
included blank and decortication flakes and occasional fire cracked quartzite and basaltic rocks.
The artifacts appear to be eroding from the upper part of the surface soils and represent a
probable encampment area.
The terrace on the east side of the creek has a less abrupt drop towards the creek and lacks
surface soils along the edge of the road right of way. The profile in the right of way shows a
surface layer of dense gravel to about 40 to 50 cm deep, over a layer of bright of wayn to tan
dense clay and caliche nodules to about 1.5 meters deep (Olmos soils), over a dense light
colored clay and gravel. Artifacts noted along the edge of the right of way and out beyond the
property fence line included tested chert cobbles, decortication flakes and cobble fragments
suggesting that the area east of the creek was exploited mostly (or entirely) as a lithic
procurement and workshop area.
The underlying light colored dense clay and gravel does not appear to be typical of the area. A
variety of materials in the lower gravel and clay include coral fossils, sandstone and larger
angular fragments. The geo-archeologist for BCS suggests that these could be tsunami deposits
from the K-T Boundary Event.
The site could only be observed from the public roadway due to trespass issues and details about
the nature and extent of the cultural deposits could not be determined. Visible surface and road
cut observations suggest that the well developed terrace on the west side of Blanco Creek was an
encampment and that the less developed (and more eroded/disturbed) terrace on the east side of
the creek was primarily if not exclusively a procurement and workshop area, presumably
associated with the encampment on the other side of the creek. The potential significance of the
locality remains unknown.
The road cut on either side of the creek is wide and deep (100 feet wide, 5 to 20 feet deep) on
either side. The new cable line will be installed in the ditch between the roadway and site areas
and will have no effect on the site.

Dr. Wish Ranch, 41UV489
This site included an abandoned house and barn in a field 100 feet north of Highway 1023 and
200 feet west of a gravel county road. The house and barn are located on a lower second terrace
on the east side of Dinner Creek. The house resembles the house at the Kelley Ranch and may
have been built about the same time, or at least by the same builder. The house is located in an
open pasture and is beginning to show signs of abandonment decay. The barn is located in a
wheat field with a dense growth of trees around it and only the tin barn was visible among the
trees. The site is labeled as ‘Dr. Wish Ranch’ on the 1898 30-minute quadrangle for the area
(Uvalde 1898).
Dr. Wish (John L. Wish) operated a business in the town of Uvalde and purchased a 310 acre
tract from his parents Casper (AKA Jasper) and Nancy Wish in 1883 (UCCR: Book L, page
128). It is unclear if Dr. Wish actually lived on the property, or if the structure was built for a
caretaker/ranch hand. The land was included in a sale from the Family Trust to Cecil Morgan in
1950 and remains in the possession of the present William Reagan Family Trust today.
The house is 1 story and has a fairly modern tin roof with a cross or ‘T’ intersecting gable
arrangement. A brick chimney protrudes from the center on the main roof line. Like the Kelley
Ranch House, this structure is a modified classical revival style. Exterior walls are bead board
siding and the roof is galvanized tin. Simple hung windows (4/4 sash) appear to be original.
Details about the foundation could not be discerned from the roadway.

Figure 50. 41UV489, two views of the ranch structures.
The Dr. Wish Ranch is a third generation ranch and post-dates the Wish Ranch by about 20
years. The site could qualify for inclusion to the NRHP under Criteria A (for its connection to
local history), Criteria C (for the house and barn structures on the site) and Criteria D (for the
probable historical features important to our understanding of later nineteenth century life ways),
pending further local research.

41UV490, The Goode Site
This is a small lithic scatter located on the west edge of a low second terrace facing the Dry Frio
River to the west (100 meters). The terrace is located along an uplands divide between the Dry
Frio and Frio River 300 meters to the east. Artifacts were located along the east edge of an
improved gravel county road for about 30 meters, and across the fence in a pasture to the east.
Access to the private property next to the public roadway could not be secured and observations
were limited to perusal from the fence line, limiting what can be said about the locality. High
ground rises to the east of the roadway and it presumed that the site covers the high ground. A
dense growth of trees and brush extends along the road edge in this area. Road improvements
have removed about 50cm of topsoil along the drainage ditch on the east side of the road and
nearly all topsoil along the west side of the road. Shovel tests along the east side of the road
showed a remnant of Uvalde clay loam (B horizon.) to 50 cm deep in the road cut and a dense
gravel deposit on the surface on the west side of the road (roughly half a meter lower than the
east side). Judging from the roadway, there could be significant deposits in the pasture east of
the road.
The proposed cable line will run in the drainage ditch on the west side of the road and will not
disturb the site area. A tunnel bore will be made to connect a radio tower on the south side of the
terrace on the east side of the road. The tower sits on a quarter acre tract that has had topsoil
removed for construction of the tower base and the connection will have no further affect on the
locality.

Synthesis and Recommendations
Fourteen archeological or historical localities were located in some proximity to the proposed
new buried cable line in Uvalde County, Texas. Many of the details about these resources could
not be gathered due to a lack of access to private property next to the public roadways. In nearly
every case, no assessment of the character or true significance of the resources could be made on
the basis of such limited observations. Several localities, however, were either substantial within
the road right of ways, or were found in local historical sources. Four historical ranches, the
Moore, Kelley, (Casper) Wish and Dr. (John) Wish ranches, are prominently labeled on the 1898
USGS topographic map, Uvalde quadrangle. The Moore and Kelley ranches started around 1846
and continue to be working ranches today. The Casper Wish Ranch was started shortly after the
Civil War and the Dr. John Wish Ranch is a second-generation ranch off set from the Casper
Wish Ranch. These four ranches together represent a continuum of the history of ranching in the
region and probably do qualify for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places, under
Criteria A. The town site of Chatfield and nearby Traprock Mine are also important nineteenth
century historical places, both being associated with the coming of the railroad to the area and
ending of the great cattle drives. Although neither site retains its physical character, both areas
are probably eligible for inclusion to the Register under Criteria A.
41UV486 has been severely disturbed by roadway construction but retains intact or partially
intact features and deposits that appear to meet the requirements for inclusion to the Register
under Criteria D. 41UV481, 482, 487, 488 and 490 may or may not qualify for inclusion to the
Register, pending research outside of the public right of way. 41UV480 and 483 appear to be
procurement areas and/or extremely disturbed lithic scatters and do not appear to be eligible for
inclusion.
The purpose of these investigations was to locate cultural resources that might be disturbed by
installation of a new buried cable line, and to make recommendations on how best to avoid
disturbance during construction. In all cases, the new cable line will be installed next to existing
buried cable lines in previously disturbed public road right of ways.
Twelve sites and two areas of historical interest were located in vicinity to the project. None of
these localities could be accessed outside of the public right of way (due to trespass issues).
Eleven of these sites have cultural material extending on to the road edge. All archeological sites
exposed along the public right of way have been severely impacted by roadway and utility line
construction. Three of the sites exposed along the roadway have some integrity below surface
disturbances and are being recommended for avoidance by rerouting or tunnel boring. Two are
historical localities which could only be viewed from the roadway.

59

Sites 41UV481, 41UV483, 41UV487 and 41UV488 are either completely disturbed in the right
of way or are minor lithic scatters of little additional value. No further concerns are being
recommended for these localities. 41UV480 appears to be extremely disturbed by roadway
activity and deep chisel plowing (to 4 feet deep). 41UV482 and 41UV484 are being
recommended for avoidance by rerouting the new cable line away from the site areas. Deep
tunnel bores are being recommended for the cable line in the vicinity of 41UV486. 41UV490 is
located near but outside of the APE. 41UV485, 41UV489, the town of Chatfield and the
Traprock Mine are located sufficiently away from the project and will not be disturbed. The
Knippa Cemetery (a part of the town of Chatfield) is located close to the proposed new cable
line, which has been rerouted to specifically avoid any disturbances. The public right of way
bisects 41UV141 but has been down cut to a depth well below the site and installation of the new
cable line within the right of way will not disturb the site further. It is being recommended that
the project be allowed to proceed as planned.
This recommendation is subject to the approval of the Texas Historical Commission.

Professional Estimations
