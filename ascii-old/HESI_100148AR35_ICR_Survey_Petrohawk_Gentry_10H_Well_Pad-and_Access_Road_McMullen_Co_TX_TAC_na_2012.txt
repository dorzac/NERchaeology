ABSTRACT

On 15 December 2011, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of Petrohawk Energy Corporation’s (PEC) proposed Gentry
10H well pad and access road right-of-way (ROW) in northeastern McMullen County, Texas
(Project Area). The proposed well pad measures approximately 500.0 by 500.0 feet (152.4 by
152.4 meters [m]), with a total area of 5.7 acres. The proposed access road ROW measures
approximately 1960.0 feet (597.4 m) in length and 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide, with a total area of
2.2 acres. Overall, the Project Area totals 7.9 acres. Although the Project Area will be located
entirely on private property and will be constructed with private funds, its construction will
require coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). As a result, the
undertaking falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project
Area on behalf of PEC in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey
was to determine if the construction of the proposed well pad and access road had the potential
to have an adverse impact on any significant cultural resources considered to be eligible for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The intensive cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative
findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of
the 19 shovel tests excavated during the survey efforts.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed Gentry 10H well pad and access road will have no adverse effect on significant
cultural resources. Horizon therefore recommends that PEC be allowed to proceed with the
construction of the proposed well pad and access road, relative to the jurisdiction of FEMA and
Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including
human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction,
use, or ongoing maintenance of the well pad and access road, even in previously surveyed
areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately and the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) and FEMA should be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of Petrohawk
Energy Corporation’s (PEC) proposed Gentry 10H well pad and access road right-of-way
(ROW) in northeastern McMullen County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The
proposed well pad measures approximately 500.0 by 500.0 feet (152.4 by 152.4 meters [m]),
with a total area of 5.7 acres. The proposed access road ROW measures approximately 1960.0
feet (597.4 m) in length and 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide, with a total area of 2.2 acres. Overall, the
Project Area totals 7.9 acres. Although the Project Area will be located entirely on private
property and will be constructed with private funds, its construction will require coordination with
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). As a result, the undertaking falls under
the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended. Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of
PEC in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine
if the construction of the proposed well pad and access road had the potential to have an
adverse impact on any significant cultural resources considered to be eligible for inclusion on
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s Principal Investigator,
while Jared Wiersema (Horizon staff archeologist) and Michael Placher conducted the field
investigations.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 15 December 2011. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts within the boundaries of the
proposed well pad access road ROW. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring
between 5.0 and 10.0 acres in size. As such, a minimum of 16 shovel tests were necessary
within the 7.9-acre Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the
TSMASS by excavating a total of 19 shovel tests within the Project Area.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

PEC’s proposed Gentry 10H well pad and access road ROW are located in northeastern
McMullen County, approximately 8.8 miles (14.2 km) east-southeast of Tilden, Texas (see
Figures 1-1 and 1-2). They can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Calliham NW, Texas, topographic quadrangle map (see Figure 1-1). The proposed well pad
measures approximately 500.0 by 500.0 feet (152.4 by 152.4 m), with a total area of 5.7 acres.
The proposed access road ROW measures approximately 1960.0 feet (597.4 m) in length and
50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide, with a total area of 2.2 acres. Overall, the Project Area totals 7.9 acres.
The proposed access road originates from an existing lease road on a hilltop east of a tributary
of Dragoon Creek. From that point, it extends to the west, across the tributary, to an elevated
ridgeline where the proposed well pad will be located (see Figures 1-1 and 1-2). Representative
images of the Project Area at the time of the cultural resource survey are presented in
Figures 2-1 through 2-4.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in northeastern McMullen County in South Texas. It is
situated on 2 upland landforms on opposing sides (east and west) of a tributary of Dragoon
Creek within the Dragoon Oil and Gas Field of South Texas. Elevations within the Project Area
range between approximately 230.0 feet (70.1 m) and 280.0 feet (85.3 m) above mean sea
level. Hydrologically, the proposed ROW is situated within the Nueces River basin. The Project
Area drains to the west and east into the tributary of Dragoon Creek. This tributary joins the
main channel of Dragoon Creek a short distance south of the Project Area. Dragoon Creek
flows to the southeast, joining the Nueces River approximately 3.8 miles (6.2 km) southeast of
the Project Area.

2.3

CLIMATE

The climate in McMullen County is generally mild in the winter, with an average
temperature of 55.5 degrees. In the summer months, the average temperature is 84.7 degrees,
with an average daily maximum temperature of 97.2 degrees. The average annual total
precipitation is about 23.42 inches. Of this, about 21.08 inches, or 90%, usually fall in February
through November. Thunderstorms occur on about 37 days each year, with most occurring in
May (NRCS 2011a).

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is located in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province (WWF 2005) and the
South Texas Plains vegetational region (Gould 1975). The upland areas support a rich tapestry
of south Texas chaparral. The vegetation of the undeveloped and uncleared areas can be
characterized as brush country, with variably dense scrub ranging in height from 4.0 to 10.0
feet. Mesquite and associated thorny shrubs, such as catclaw acacia, huisache, blackbrush,
granjeno, whitebrush, prickly pear, and Spanish dagger are common locally. Understory
vegetation is characteristically sparse. Along major drainages, live oak, Texas sugarberry,
cedar elm, and retama occur. Little bluestem, bristlegrass, paspalums, windmill grass, and
buffelgrass are dominant grasses.
The Tamaulipan/Mezquital ecoregion of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico has
unique plant and animal communities containing tree- and brush-covered dunes, wind tidal flats,
and dense native brushland (WWF 2005). Although there are large acreages of cultivated land
on the South Texas Plains, most of the area is still rangeland. Land holdings predominantly are
large cattle ranches. Deer and other wildlife species are common. This area originally
supported a grassland- or savannah-type climax vegetation. Long continued grazing and other
factors have altered the plant communities to such a degree that ranchmen of the region now
face a severe brush problem (Gould 1975).

3.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of no previously recorded archeological sites or
cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project Area. Similarly, a review of the
National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer also indicated the presence of no
historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (THC 2011; NPS 2011). No
documented cultural resources, including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or
immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas data, no
previous cultural resources investigations have been conducted within or immediately adjacent
to the boundaries of the Project Area.
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms on opposing sides of a tributary of Dragoon Creek, it was Horizon’s original
opinion that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
resources within the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, no structures are visible in proximity to the Project
Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map. This suggested a decreased potential for
undocumented historic-era standing structures or cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.

4.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A Horizon archeologist completed the intensive pedestrian survey of the Project Area
ROW on 15 December 2011. This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel
testing efforts within the boundaries of the proposed well pad and access road ROW. The
TSMASS require a minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 5.0 and
10.0 acres in size. As such, a minimum of 16 shovel tests were necessary within the 7.9-acre
Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the minimum survey
standards by excavating a total of 19 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated
matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.0-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowelsorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. If any new archeological sites were recorded, standard site forms were to
be completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. Similarly, if any previously recorded archeological sites were assessed, updated site
forms were to be completed and filed at TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility or
for return to the appropriate landowner. Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and
assessed in the field and placed back where they were found. Digital photographs with a photo
log were completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via
handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 83 map datum. Shovel
test locations are presented in Figure 4-1. Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

5.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1

RESULTS

On 15 December 2011, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of
PEC’s proposed Gentry 10H well pad and access road ROW in northeastern McMullen County,
Texas. The proposed well pad measures approximately 500.0 by 500.0 feet (152.4 by 152.4
m), with a total area of 5.7 acres. The proposed access road ROW measures approximately
1960.0 feet (597.4 m) in length and 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide, with a total area of 2.2 acres.
Overall, the Project Area totals 7.9 acres. Although the Project Area will be located entirely on
private property and will be constructed with private funds, its construction will require
coordination with FEMA. As a result, the undertaking falls under the regulations of Section 106
of the NHPA. Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the proposed well pad and
access road ROW on behalf of PEC in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose
of the survey was to determine if the construction of the proposed well pad and access road had
the potential to have an adverse impact on any significant cultural resources considered to be
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
The intensive cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative
findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the proposed well pad and
access road ROW or within any of the 19 shovel tests excavated during the survey efforts.

5.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed Gentry 10H well pad and access road ROW will have no adverse effect on significant
cultural resources. Horizon therefore recommends that PEC be allowed to proceed with the
construction of the proposed well pad and access road, relative to the jurisdiction of FEMA and
Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including
human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction,
use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed well pad and access road, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately and the THC
and FEMA should be notified of the discovery.
