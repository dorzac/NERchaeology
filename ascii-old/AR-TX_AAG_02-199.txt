ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of approximately 25.86 miles (156.73 acres) of Highway
67 right-of-way (50 feet wide), for the City of Abilene’s proposed Reverse Osmosis
Discharge Outfall Pipeline, associated with the City of Abilene’s Possum Kingdom Raw
Water Roughing Facility, located on the East/Southeast side of Highway 67 in Stephens
and Young Counties, Texas was conducted by American Archaeology Group LLC in
December 2014. The survey was conducted under the auspices of Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 7097 and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (potential Corps
of Engineers permitting). The entire project line is located in existing road right-of-ways,
and there was evidence of extensive disturbances and proving a mixed context of any
deposits that may remain. Seven archaeological sites were recorded (two inside the rightof-way, and four just outside the right-of-way).
Site 41YN54 was previously recorded by G.E. Arnold in 1938-1939 as part of early
WPA work along the Brazos River. The investigators noted that this site contained Middle
and Late Archaic dart points, Late Prehistoric points, pottery, blanks, cores, hammer
stones, utilized flakes, bifaces, scrapers, and an abrading stone. During the course of this
investigation it appeared that this site was located or confined to a terrace further to the
east, yet there appeared to be a sloping portion of the terrace towards the Highway 67
crossing of the Brazos River, just inside the right-of-way. BHT-1-3 did not reveal any
subsurface cultural deposits. It appears that approximately 60 centimeters of sand deposits
were removed by road construction and right-of-way maintenance at 1,021 feet elevation
(amsl). This site falls within the Lower Brazos Indian Reservation that existed from 1854
to 1859, of which the southwestern corner of the entire reservation was located along the
Highway 67 right-of-way. A small linear edge of the site is located just inside the Highway
67 right-of-way along the fence line. Upon close examination, and trowelling the profile,
a small piece of mussel shell was recovered at 10 centimeters below the surface of the
remaining soil deposits and submitted for radiocarbon dating to provide at least a minimum
date of occupation. The sample (Beta Analytic Sample Number 399077) yielded a
Conventional Radiocarbon date of 1 2 , 7 3 0 +/- 40 B.P. (Before Present), and calibrated
to 13,305-13,145 B.C. (Appendix IV). The radiocarbon sample was collected to at least
provide some minimal occupation date for this site, even though it has been severely
impacted. However, this mussel shell may represent an isolated naturally deposited shell or
there could be potential Paleo-Indian deposits on the private side of the right-of-way fence,
further to the east. No intact features, artifacts or defined stratigraphy were encountered,
therefore, this portion of the site contained within the Highway 67 right-of-way is not
considered eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or
worthy of designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
Site 41YN534 was recorded as an early to mid -20th century historic habitation site
based on the presence of what appears to be a house mound, possible pier stones, and
several brick fragments. The site appears to have been bulldozed, but east of the Highway
67 right-of-way (outside of the project area) on a slope at 1,090 feet elevation (amsl). Clear
glass, brown glass, and several brick fragments were observed across the fence line. Any

ii

future proposed impacts east of the Highway 67 right-of-way should assess the cultural
deposits at this site.
Site 41YN535 was recorded an early to mid -20th century historic habitation site
based on the presence of two brick fragments, clear glass, brown glass, and white ware
ceramics outside of the right-of-way, across the fence on private property. The site appears
to have been bulldozed, but located east of Highway 67 right-of-way on a slope at 1,102
feet (amsl) elevation. Any future proposed impacts east of the Highway 67 right-of-way
should assess the cultural deposits at this site.
Site 41YN536 was recorded as a historic habitation site based on the presence of a
well or cistern. It was observed approximately 25 meters east of the fence line of the eastern
boundary of the Highway 67 right-of-way, outside of the project area. The site is located
on flat land at the 1,081 feet (amsl) elevation. Any future proposed impacts east of the
Highway 67 right-of-way should assess the cultural deposits at this site.
Site 41YN537 was recorded as a historic habitation site that appears to be a house
mound accumulation with a row of iris planted along the fence/border of the existing
Highway 67 right-of-way at 1,092 feet elevation (amsl). The site appears to have been
bulldozed, but located just across the fence line on private property, outside of the Highway
67 right-of-way. Any future proposed impacts east of the Highway 67 right-of-way should
assess the cultural deposits at this site.
Site 41SE334 was recorded as a historic site of unknown type at 1,130 feet elevation
(amsl). It was recorded based on the presence of a small concrete foundation fragment
found in a bulldozed pile inside the existing Highway 67 right-of-way. Any future proposed
impacts east of the Highway 67 right-of-way should assess the cultural deposits at this site.
Subsurface tests did not locate any sub-surface cultural deposits. The site appears to have
been destroyed. No sub-surface cultural deposits, features, significant artifact assemblages
were found, and no architecturally significant features were located, therefore, this site is
considered not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP nor worthy of designation as a SAL.
Site 41SE335 was recorded as a historic ranching complex with several old barns
and small structures, all located southeast of the existing Highway 67 right-of-way, outside
of the project area and on private land at 1,175 feet elevation (amsl). It appeared that the
private landowners were building onto one of the historic structures. Any future proposed
impacts east of the Highway 67 right-of-way should assess the cultural deposits at this site.
American Archaeology Group LLC recommends that construction within the
project area be allowed to proceed as planned. Monitoring during construction by a
professional archaeologist is not considered necessary. No artifacts were collected,
therefore, no curation was arranged, and project forms were curated at AAG.

INTRODUCTION
American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) is assisting the City of Abilene with the
permitting process required to proceed with construction of new pipeline to transfer reverse
osmosis (RO) concentrate (wastewater) from the proposed new Possum Kingdom (PK) Raw
Water Roughing Facility (RWRF) to the proposed discharge outfall at the intersection of Hwy
67 and the Brazos River, in Stephens and Young counties, Texas (Figure 1). Due to ongoing
drought conditions an additional source of raw water for the City of Abilene is needed. The
planned project will consist of improvements to implement Possum Kingdom Lake as a raw
water supply under the City of Abilene’s Second Stage Short-term Drought Strategy. This
portion of the project is the RO Discharge Outfall Pipeline which extends to the east from the
proposed PK RWRF, then northeast along the entire East/Southeast side right-of-way of Hwy
67 (approximately 50 feet), and terminates at the new discharge outfall location at the Brazos
River. In December 2014, AAG conducted an archaeological survey and testing in the
project area, which covers approximately 25.86 miles (Figure 2). This report describes the
implementation and results of the investigation. Funding for the project was provided by
the City of Abilene. Even though there are numerous impacts, an intensive Phase I survey
was designed to identify any cultural resources that might be present and assessed prior to
emergency construction.
The investigation was designed to detect prehistoric and/or historic cultural
resources that could potentially be impacted by the proposed City of Abilene PK RO
Discharge Outfall Pipeline. Fieldwork was authorized by the Texas Historical Commission
(Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7097) and comprised systematic surface survey at 5
meter intervals and subsurface testing was completed through backhoe trenching and
shovel testing since the proposed depth of impacts is 4-6 feet below surface. At the time
fieldwork was undertaken, approximately 70% of the project area had been subjected to
various impacts in the past including cutting and filling, road construction, right-of-way
maintenance, utility installation, pipelines, and erosion. There were several major utility
lines and other gas and water lines that traversed through the project area. These impacts
are extensive as noted by the presence of backfill rock and trash in the Southern portion of
the project area very close to the Brazos River.
The project area is depicted on the 7.5’ U.S.G.S. topographic quadrangle
Breckenridge, Grand Lake, Ivan South, Ivan North, and South Bend (Figure 2). The U.T.M.
coordinates for the approximate center of the tract are Zone 14 Northing 3623817 and
Easting 513259. Appendix I contains the Research Design and Scope of Work. The nearest
water source is immediately east of the project area. The topographic position range of the
project area is 1,015-1,210 feet in elevation above mean sea level (amsl).
Previous archaeological surveys in Stephens County have identified significant
prehistoric and historic sites. Enprotec/Hibbs & Todd Inc. contracted with American
Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G.) to perform an archaeological survey under the auspices
of the Texas Antiquities Code pursuant to Antiquities Permit Number 7097, and Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.

ENVIROMENTAL SETTING
Natural Setting
This section was previously prepared by AAG (Griggs et al. 2007:4). The project
area is located in the Cross Timbers and Prairies ecological region of Texas (Gould 1975).
This region covers 67,340 square kilometers (26,000 square miles) in the north central
portion of the state (Figure 3). Potential vegetation is alternating bands of wooded habitat
scattered throughout prairie dominated by one-three foot tall grasses (TPWD 2007a).
Historic anthropogenic disturbances have significantly altered native plant communities.
Common trees present today, particularly in the vicinity of Stephens and Young Counties,
include pecan, mesquite, hackberry and elm. Grasses include broom weed, wild rye and
milkweed. The topography is broken with hilly plateaus. Average annual rainfall levels in
the Cross Timbers region grade higher from east to west. In Stephens and Young Counties
the average annual rainfall is 67.1 centimeters (26.4 inches). Average temperatures range
from a low of 31° F in January to a high of 98° F in July (Leffler 2007).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Cultural Sequence
This section was previously prepared by AAG (Griggs et al. 2007:8-11). The land
that is now Texas has been occupied by human populations for more than 11,000 years. A
chronological framework developed by archaeologists for the interpretation of Texas
history comprises five general temporal periods whose boundaries correspond to
significant cultural and social developments (Nunley 1989:37-46). These periods and their
approximate dates are as follows: 1) Paleoindian (11,500- 8500 before present [hereafter
B.P.]); 2) Archaic (8500-1200 B.P.); 3) Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800-1450); 4) Protohistoric
(A.D. 1450-1650); and 5) Historic (A.D. 1650-1940s).
The Paleoindian period begins during the last Glacial and continues into the early
Holocene. The earliest confirmed Paleoindian populations in Texas were small, highly
mobile bands of hunters armed with distinctive fluted “Clovis” projectile points who
pursued large, late Pleistocene mammals, most notably mammoths (Surovell 2000; Turner
and Hester 1985; Waguespack and Surovell 2003). Later Paleoindian populations
developed new forms of projectile points and refined their hunting strategies in response
to environmental factors such as the extinction of the mammoth and other megamammals;
yet despite these adaptations, they maintained life ways more like those of their
predecessors than those of later Archaic populations.
The complete demise of the Pleistocene big-game animals and climate change
accompanying the onset of the Holocene are linked to shifts in stone tool technology,
subsistence pursuits and settlement patterns that define the Archaic period. The
Paleoindian-Archaic transition, like those between succeeding periods, occurred gradually.
As the Pleistocene megamammals began to vanish, indigenous populations focused on
smaller game and increased their reliance on local plant foods. With changes in subsistence
came new and more diverse stone toolkits and an increase in tools made of wood and other
organic materials. Additionally, settlements became more stable, and there is evidence for
progressively sophisticated cultural practices, such as systematic burial of the dead
(Bousman et al. 2002). Although the Archaic hunting and gathering lifeway remained
relatively stable for thousands of years, archaeologists are able to define four sub periods
(or eras) – Early, Middle, Late and Transitional – based on a dated sequence of diagnostic
projectile points (Turner and Hester 1985:47-49).
The Late Prehistoric period is marked in some areas of Texas, including the north
central region, by the introduction of domesticated plant foods such as corn and beans.
Technological innovations such as pottery and the bow and arrow were widely adopted
(Nunley 1989:44; Turner and Hester 1985:82).
The Protohistoric period is associated with an incipient European presence in the
region. Protohistoric indigenous populations were the first described in early ethnohistoric
accounts. Often, these accounts reflected only indirect contact. Items of European

15

manufacture are occasionally found in Protohistoric sites, though in most cases these items
were not acquired directly but through so called down-the-line trading (Nunley 1989:45).
The Historic period is characterized by a firm historical record and increasing direct
contact between indigenous and European explorers and settlers. Horses introduced by the
Spanish and European material culture led to profound changes in indigenous cultures.
Eventually, Old World diseases, resettlement and warfare claimed up to 95% of Texas
Indians (Klos 2007). The latter part of the Historic period encompasses the AngloEuropean settlement of Texas.
Local Archaeological and Historical Context
In Stephens County 320 archaeological sites are registered with Texas Historical
Commission. The vast majority of these are located in the north central and northeastern
part of the county along the Clear Fork of the Brazos River and on Hubbard Creek
downstream from the Hubbard Creek Reservoir (RCRI 2014). The distribution of these
sites reflects both a predilection on the part of prehistoric populations for riparian
settlements, which provided access to fresh water and game animals, and a recent surge in
archaeological surveys along river ways targeted for reservoir projects.
Sites dating to all periods of the cultural chronology outlined in the section above,
with the exception of the Protohistoric, are represented in site records for Stephens County
(RCRI 2014). It is possible that some of the registered Late Prehistoric sites were occupied
in the Protohistoric period, but this is difficult to demonstrate since most material remains
from the Protohistoric are indistinguishable from those of the Late Prehistoric. Paleoindian
sites are truly rare in the county; only one has been registered (site 41SE78). Most
prehistoric sites have been assigned to the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods on the basis
of temporally diagnostic artifacts, primarily arrow points. Two sites from these periods
(41SE2 and 41SE3) contain rock art, which is uncommon in north central Texas (Figure 4;
Jackson 1938: 292-295). Around 15% of sites in the county contain historic components
that range from simple surface scatters of historic debris, such as glass and metal, to oilfield
camps and buildings. The County Courthouse, located in Breckenridge, has been
designated as a State Archaeological Landmark (RCRI 2014).

The best documented period of prehistory in north central Texas is the Late
Prehistoric. During this period a large block of north central Texas, including much of
Stephens and Young Counties, was occupied by interrelated populations whose shared
cultural traits, (e.g., artifact types and adaptive strategies) are referred to by archaeologists
as the Henrietta Focus. The Harrell site, located in southern Young County, at the
confluence of the Brazos River and Clear Fork, is the “type site,” or ideal example, of the
Henrietta Focus (Krieger 1946:137). Current estimates place the chronological range of the
focus between A.D. 1200-1600 (Lynott 2007). Inhabitants of the Harrell site and other
Henrietta Focus sites were maize agriculturalists and hunters. Bison was the preferred
game, but deer, antelope and other small mammals, as well as turtles, turkey, ducks and
fish also contributed to the subsistence base. The material culture of the Henrietta Focus is
uniquely represented by a shell tempered pottery, Nocona Plain. Other artifacts associated
with the focus, though not exclusive to it, are small, triangular Harrell and Washita arrow
points (Figure 5), diamond-shaped and leaf-shaped bifaces, manos, metates, bison scapula
hoes, deer ulna flakers and disc beads made of perforated mussel or Olivella shell (Krieger
1946:137-141; Lynott 2007). These artifacts, as well as a farming and hunting subsistence
base, link the Henrietta Focus to a broader cultural tradition, the Plains Villager Horizon,
which extends across the river valleys of the Southern Plains. Trade relations with groups
to the west are indicated at Henrietta Focus sites by the occurrence of stone tools made of

17

agatized dolomite from the Alibates Flint Quarry in the Texas Panhandle and Puebloan
pottery from the New Mexico area (Krieger 1946:111-112, 119).

During the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, north central Texas witnessed
the arrival of the Comanche, Kiowa and Tonkawa Indians. These groups are believed to
have migrated from the Great Basin and High Plains regions after acquiring Spanish horses.
All three were nomadic and depended on the buffalo for their subsistence (Mayhall 2007;
Lipscomb 2007; Carlisle 2007).
In the late 1850s, Anglo settlers began moving into north central Texas, and in 1858
the Texas legislature established what is now known as Stephens County (the original name
of Buchanan County was changed to Stephens in 1861 in honor of the vice president of the
Confederate States of America). Though early settlers were constantly harassed by raiding
parties of Comanche and Kiowa Indians until the early 1870s, the population of the county
grew steadily, reaching 4,725 by 1880 (Leffler 2007).
The first waves of Anglo settlers in Stephens County were primarily cattle ranchers.
By the late nineteenth century, however, cotton and corn farming provided a significant
contribution to the local economy. Cotton production fell precipitously following a boll
weevil infestation in the first decade of the twentieth century, but that bad fortune was
eventually eclipsed by an oil boom that began in 1916 with a strike at a well near Caddo.
Additional fields were soon discovered, and by 1922 Stephens County accounted for 15
percent of all the oil produced in the United States. The boom lured thousands of new
residents to the county, as well as eighty-nine oil companies and two railroads. Although
production slowed by the mid-1920s, oil remains a significant industry in the county. Other
key industries in Stephens County today are recreation, livestock agriculture and
manufacturing. Manufactured products include mobile homes, furniture, aircraft parts,
petrochemical and oilfield equipment (Leffler 2007; Hunt 2007).
Young County is located just north of Stephens County and was formed in 1856
out of the original Bosque and Fannin Counties. It had been part of the original Peters
Colony, a Mexican Land Grant. In 1851, the United States Army established Fort Belknap
on the Red Fork of the Brazos River, and served as one of the largest and more important
military forts in Texas prior to the Civil War (Leffler 2010).

18

In 1854, the Lower Brazos Indian Reservation was established and surveyed by
Captain Randolph B. Marcy, approximately 12 miles southeast of Fort Belknap. The
original reservation consisted of 18,576 acres and over 2,000 Indians from the Tonkawa,
Waco, Anadarko, and Caddo tribes resided on the reservation. Reservation Indians were
constantly being blamed for regional depredations and relations with settlers were strained.
In 1858, Texas Governor Hardin R. Runnels and General Sam Houston requested that the
federal government remove the Indians. On May 23, 1859, John R. Baylor led a small force
onto the reservation and killed an old man and woman. By July of that year, the Indians
had been removed to Oklahoma (Leffler 2010).
In 1871, the famous Warren Wagon Train Raid occurred in which over 100 Indians
from the Kiowa, Kiowa-Apache, Comanche, Cheyenne, and Arapaho were led by Satank
(a Kiowa Medicine man), and Chiefs Satanta (White Bear), Addo-etta (Big Tree), and
Maman-ti (Sky Walker). All but 5 of the settlers were killed by the raiding party. In 1873,
the former Lower Brazos Indian Reservation was opened up to settlement after the Indians
had finally been removed from Texas.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Shelton (2009) conducted an archaeological survey for the Stephens Regional
Special Utility District (RSUD) Waterline Improvements north and southwest of the
extreme west end of the current project area next to Gunsolus (Gonzales) Creek. One
prehistoric lithic procurement site was recorded (41SE307). The site was determined to be
ineligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.
Griggs et al. (2007) surveyed approximately 2.98 acres for proposed improvements
at the Anniversary Park, located on the west side of Lake Hubbard Creek in Stephens
County, Texas in March 2007. The planned project consisted of improvements at a boat
ramp location within Anniversary Park, south of Highway 180. Approximately 70% of the
project area has been subjected to various impacts in the past including cutting and filling,
parking lot construction, and boat ramp construction. No archaeological sites were
encountered.
Texas A&M University conducted a large 37,000 acre survey for the proposed
South Bend Reservoir in 1987-1988 that recorded 541 prehistoric and 168 historic sites
along the Clear Fork of the Brazos River basin (Saunders et al. 1992). This included the
area above the confluence of the Clear Fork of the Brazos River and the Brazos River in
Stephens, Throckmorton and Young Counties, Texas.
There are two previously recorded archaeological sites that appear to be within
close proximity of the Area of Potential effect (APE). They are sites 41YN1 (Harrell Site)
and 41YN54, both WPA-era sites. The Harrell Site (41YN1) is listed on the National
Register of Historic Places and contained 29 burials, and served as the type site for the
Henrietta Focus, and dated A.D. 1200-1500). Additionally, it also appears that a survey
was conducted where Highway 67 crosses the Brazos River in Young County, Texas
(adjacent to 41YN54) but based on the records, it was a surface survey and no
archaeological sites were identified.
Site 41YN2 is a prehistoric midden and burial site that was recorded by A. M.
Woolsey during the Works Progress Administration (WPA) project that conducted work
along the Brazos River in the late 1930s. This site is located north of 41YN54, on the north
side of the Brazos River. Denton (1984) conducted test excavations on the portion of the
site that extended into the Highway 67 right-of-way, but no cultural deposits were found
to be significant, and that portion of the site did not meet the eligibility requirements for
inclusion on the NRHP.

20

PROJECT METHODOLOGY
The project was divided into three phases – archival research, field survey, and
report preparation. The archival research consisted of a check for records of registered
sites in the online “Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,” which is maintained by the Texas
Historical Commission, as well as a review of other literature for publications concerning
previous work in the county.
The field investigation was conducted in December 2014. The field investigation
involved a pedestrian surface survey supported with backhoe trenching and shovel testing
(Figure 2; Appendix II-III). The survey was conducted systematically across the entire
25.86 mile project right-of-way, with members of the survey team inspecting the ground
surface along linear transects spaced at 5 meter intervals. Approximately 70% of the
ground surface of the project area had been disturbed by prior earth moving activities.
Other surface disturbances included asphalt pavement and road construction, various utility
instillation, pipeline construction, right-of-way maintenance, and erosion. (Appendix I).
Visibility of the ground surface was obscured by patches of short grasses. There were 102
backhoe trenches (BHTs) excavated to test for subsurface deposits of cultural remains and
they ranged from the shallowest at 6 centimeters to the deepest at 3.37 meters in depth with
the average test depth of 147.41 centimeters. Additionally, 203 shovel tests were placed
along the project alignment to provide additional near surface testing. They ranged from
the shallowest at 5 centimeters to the deepest at 55 centimeters and the average depth was
23.30 centimeters. Samples of soil from each BHT were screened through ¼” hardware
cloth.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
A review of the archaeological literature for Stephens and Young Counties revealed
no previously recorded sites within the project area. There were three sites worth
referencing which include 41SE5, 41SE301 and 41SE32. The first is an exposed bedrock
mortar (prehistoric) with five “eye-shaped” mortar holes. This site is located on a peninsula
extending into Hubbard Creek Reservoir northwest of the project area. Site 41SE301 lies
to the west of the project area, just north of Hwy 180. It is the ruin of an historic homestead.
Several sherds of glass and historic earthenware were recovered during a surface collection
at the site, and a cistern was documented. Site 41SE32, located west of 41SE301, is
described as a prehistoric campsite with a Late Prehistoric component. Several chipped
stone tools and a Scallorn arrow point were recovered during a surface survey. No
additional field research was recommended at any of the three sites by the archaeologists
who documented them.
Field Survey
The field investigation conducted for this project covered approximately 25.86
miles of highway 67 right-of-way in Stephens and Young Counties, Texas. Roughly 70%
of the project area had been heavily disturbed by prior earth moving activities. The survey
included a systematic inspection of the ground surface of the project area supported by
backhoe trenching and shovel testing to test for subsurface deposits. Most of the soils were
formed on top of bedrock with exception to alluvial sand deposits where the very north end
of the project ends at the Brazos River (Figure 6). The majority of the soils were formed
on top of sandstone and limestone formations with sandy and clay loam, extensive bedded
clay deposits (Figure 7). The entire right-of-way on the east side of Highway 67 has been
impacted extensively. There were many areas in which shallow soils existed directly on
top of bedrock and some areas that could not be tested due to bedrock exposure at the
surface (Figure 8). The only area of concerns along the entire proposed pipeline is the area
along Elliott Road in Breckenridge where the Breckenridge Cemetery is located. The plans
have been modified to place the pipeline on the north side of Elliott Road in order to create
a huge buffer zone between the pipeline and the edge of the walled Breckenridge Cemetery
(Figure 9).

Site 41YN54 was previously recorded by G.E. Arnold in 1938-1939 as part of early
WPA work along the Brazos River. The investigators noted that this site contained Middle
and Late Archaic dart points, Late Prehistoric points, pottery, blanks, cores, hammer
stones, utilized flakes, bifaces, scrapers, and an abrading stone. During the course of this
investigation it appeared that this site was located or confined to a terrace further to the
east, yet there appeared to be a sloping portion of the terrace towards the Highway 67
crossing of the Brazos River, just inside the right-of-way (Figure 10). BHT-1-3 did not
reveal any subsurface cultural deposits. It appears that approximately 60 centimeters of
sand deposits were removed by road construction and right-of-way maintenance at 1,021
feet elevation (amsl). This site falls within the Lower Brazos Indian Reservation that
existed from 1854 to 1859, of which the southwestern corner of the entire reservation was
located along the Highway 67 right-of-way (Figure 11). A small linear edge of the site is
located just inside the Highway 67 right-of-way along the fence line. Upon close
examination, and trowelling the profile, a small piece of mussel shell was recovered at 10
centimeters below the surface and submitted for radiocarbon dating to provide at least a
minimum date of occupation. No other remains were recovered. The sample (Beta Analytic
Sample Number 399077) yielded a Conventional Radiocarbon date of 1 2 , 7 3 0 +/- 40
B.P. (Before Present), calibrated to 13,305-13,145 B.C. (Appendix IV). The radiocarbon
sample was collected to at least provide some minimal occupation date for this site, even
though it has been severely impacted. However, this mussel shell may represent an isolated
naturally deposited shell or there could be potential Paleo-Indian deposits on the private side
of the right-of-way fence, further to the east. No intact features, artifacts or defined
stratigraphy were encountered, therefore, this portion of the site contained within the
Highway 67 right-of-way is not considered eligible for inclusion on the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) or worthy of designation as a State Archeological Landmark
(SAL).

Site 41YN534 was recorded as an early to mid -20th century historic habitation site
based on the presence of what appears to be a house mound, possible pier stones, and
several brick fragments (Figure 12). The site appears to have been bulldozed, but east of
the Highway 67 right-of-way (outside of the project area) on a slope at 1,090 feet elevation
(amsl). Clear glass, brown glass, and several brick fragments were observed across the
fence line. Any future proposed impacts east of the Highway 67 right-of-way should assess
the cultural deposits at this site.
Site 41YN535 was recorded an early to mid -20th century historic habitation site
based on the presence of two brick fragments, clear glass, brown glass, and white ware
ceramics outside of the right-of-way, across the fence on private property (Figure 13). The
site appears to have been bulldozed, but located east of Highway 67 right-of-way on a slope
at 1,102 feet (amsl) elevation. Any future proposed impacts east of the Highway 67 rightof-way should assess the cultural deposits at this site.
Site 41YN536 was recorded as a historic habitation site based on the presence of a
well or cistern (Figure 14). It was observed approximately 25 meters east of the fence line
of the eastern boundary of the Highway 67 right-of-way, outside of the project area. The
site is located on flat land at the 1,081 feet (amsl) elevation. Any future proposed impacts
east of the Highway 67 right-of-way should assess the cultural deposits at this site.

26

Figure 12. Eastern view of site 41YN534. Note brick fragments and other historic debris
scattered in front of the tree.
Site 41YN537 was recorded as a historic habitation site that appears to be a house
mound accumulation with a row of iris planted along the fence /border of the existing
Highway 67 right-of-way at 1,092 feet elevation (amsl). The site appears to have been
bulldozed, but located just across the fence line on private property, outside of the Highway
67 right-of-way (Figure 15). Any future proposed impacts east of the Highway 67 right-ofway should assess the cultural deposits at this site.
Site 41SE335 was recorded as a historic ranching complex with several old barns
and small structures (Figure 16), all located southeast of the existing Highway 67 right-ofway, outside of the project area and on private land at 1,175 feet elevation (amsl). It
appeared that the private landowners were building onto one of the historic structures. Any
future proposed impacts east of the Highway 67 right-of-way should assess the cultural
deposits at this site.
Site 41SE334 was recorded as a historic site of unknown type (Figure 17) at 1,130
feet elevation (amsl). It was recorded based on the presence of a small concrete foundation
fragment found in a bulldozed pile inside the existing Highway 67 right-of-way. Any future
proposed impacts east of the Highway 67 right-of-way should assess the cultural deposits
at this site. Subsurface tests did not locate any sub-surface cultural deposits. The site
appears to have been destroyed. No sub-surface cultural deposits, features, significant
artifact assemblages were found, and no architecturally significant features were located,
therefore, this site is considered not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP nor worthy of
designation as a SAL.

RECOMMENDATIONS
American Archaeology Group LLC recommends that construction within the
project area be allowed to proceed as planned. The small linear area that appears to
potentially comprise a western extension of 41YN54 will be avoided by the proposed
construction in order to preserve that area and to maintain stabilization of the edge of the
site along the fence line. No artifacts were collected, therefore, no curation was necessary.
Monitoring during construction by a professional archaeologist is not considered
necessary. However, should any cultural materials be exposed in any area not discussed
in this report, all work in the immediate area must cease until the situation can be evaluated
by American Archaeology Group LLC in consultation with the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission and Enprotec/Hibbs & Todd, Inc.

APPENDIX I: RESEARCH DESIGN AND SCOPE OF WORK
Records Check
Prior to entering the field, American Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G.) will contact
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, the state
repository for site records on Texas, to determine if previously recorded sites are present
in the project area. This task may be conducted by a personal visit to TARL or by telephone.
The library at A.A.G. is very extensive, especially regarding reports for the project
area region, and much of the archival work can be accomplished in-house. Since A.A.G.
has conducted work in the area, much of the background work has already been
accomplished.
Permit Application
No fieldwork will commence until a permit from the Archeology Division (AD) of
the Texas Historical Commission has been issued. An application for an antiquities permit
will be submitted to AD-THC as soon as A.A.G. receives Notice To Proceed. Normally,
A.A.G. discusses the project with AD personnel before beginning any fieldwork. This is
done to ensure that both parties are in agreement as to the level of work required for this
project.
Survey Methods
The entire project area will be 100% intensively surveyed utilizing the pedestrian
survey method supported by shovel testing and/or augering and examination of eroded and
disturbed areas where cultural materials may be visible on the surface. Herbert G. Uecker
will act as the Principal Investigator. Shovel testing, augering, and backhoe trenching will
meet and exceed the Minimum Survey Standards For Texas established by the THC.
In areas of poor visibility, and environmental settings that have potential for buried
cultural materials, shovel testing will be required and tests will be concentrated in areas of
high site probability and randomly across the project area. All excavated fill from shovel
tests will be screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests will be manually
excavated to sterile clay or bedrock when possible.
The survey crew will be equipped with shovel test forms, notebooks, camera,
compass, and a project area map for accurate plotting of shovel tests, backhoe trenches,
and archaeological sites. In addition to shovel testing as a means of identifying buried sites,
select areas in alluvial settings or areas with some appreciable soil depth will be subjected
to backhoe trenching. All sites identified in the project area will be mapped in the field and
plotted on a topographic map. Site locations will also be determined through the use of a
Global Positioning System (GPS). Each site will be recorded using the official State of

35

Texas Archeological Site Form. In no case will the survey crew work outside of the project
area as depicted on the project area map provided by the client.

Only diagnostic artifacts will be collected from the surface. All artifacts recovered
through shovel testing will be collected. These specimens will be bagged and recorded on
a field sack log. They will be analyzed and prepared for eventual curation at TARL, unless
a petition to discard is prepared and accepted.
The draft report will be submitted to AD-THC for review. Once the report has been
approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), copies will be delivered to
AD-THC and the client. A.A.G. will maintain copies of the notes, photographs, site forms,
and any other records produced from the project deemed to be a work product.

RE: Radiocarbon Dating Result For Sample AAG-199-1
Dear Mr. Bradle:
Enclosed is the radiocarbon dating result for one sample recently sent to us. As usual, specifics of
the analysis are listed on the report with the result and calibration data is provided where applicable. The
Conventional Radiocarbon Age has been corrected for total fractionation effects and where applicable,
calibration was performed using 2013 calibration databases (cited on the graph pages).
The web directory containing the table of results and PDF download also contains pictures, a cvs
spreadsheet download option and a quality assurance report containing expected vs. measured values for
3-5 working standards analyzed simultaneously with your samples.
The reported result is accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423
standards and all pretreatments and chemistry were performed here in our laboratories and counted in our
own accelerators here in Miami. Since Beta is not a teaching laboratory, only graduates trained to strict
protocols of the ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423 program participated in the
analysis.
As always Conventional Radiocarbon Ages and sigmas are rounded to the nearest 10 years per
the conventions of the 1977 International Radiocarbon Conference. When counting statistics produce
sigmas lower than +/- 30 years, a conservative +/- 30 BP is cited for the result.
When interpreting the result, please consider any communications you may have had with us
regarding the sample. As always, your inquiries are most welcome. If you have any questions or would
like further details of the analysis, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Thank you for prepaying the analyses. As always, if you have any questions or would like to
discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,
