Abstract
Cultural resource specialists from AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra), working
on behalf of the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) and their environmental
consultant, Freese and Nichols, Inc. conducted an intensive archeological survey
for proposed lake facility sites and administrative facilities to be located adjacent
to the proposed Bois D’Arc Lake, just east-northeast of Bonham in Fannin County,
Texas. The cultural resource survey was conducted to meet Antiquities Code of Texas
(ACT) compliance obligations, as well as to meet the standards of Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), as amended, should such
coordination be necessary. Five locations were investigated, totaling approximately 76
acres. Archeologists, working under Texas Antiquities Permit 8971, conducted surface
inspection and dug 58 shovel tests through largely open, agricultural fields with shallow,
upland-variety soils or deeper sandy soils near drainages and farm ponds. Four Gradall
scrapes were excavated outside of the historic-age Cross Cemetery, adjacent to one of the
proposed lake facility sites. The scrapes suggest that potential unmarked burials are not
likely to extend beyond the cemetery’s mapped boundary. Two historic-age archeological
sites (41FN279 and 41FN280), both historic-age artifact scatters, were recorded. These
sites have minimal artifact assemblages and are clearly disturbed and/or redeposited
from more upland areas that once contained historic-age buildings. In addition to the
archaeological survey, architectural historians evaluated two resources observed and
documented by the survey team to determine their age and significance. One resource,
a farm complex, was determined to be largely modern (less than 45 years old), and one
house ruin located outside of the project area was of historic-age but had no cultural
material within the project area. No resources are recommended as eligible for listing
on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL). The Principal Investigator recommends that the proposed lake facility
sites will have no adverse effect on properties eligible for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL
and should proceed with no further cultural resource coordination required under the
ACT or (should it apply) Section 106 of the NHPA. No artifacts were collected. All projectgenerated notes, forms, photographs, and other materials will be curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.

Introduction and Project Description
The North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) is proposing to construct lake
facility sites and administrative facilities adjacent to the Bois D’Arc Lake (BDL) Project
east-northeast of Bonham, Fannin County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). The designs, as
currently proposed, include five locations that will contain new parking lots, boat ramps,
and administrative buildings. These locations are scattered around the perimeter of
the proposed impoundment area of the BDL Project, just above the floodplain. In total,
about 76 acres were surveyed in association with the proposed lake facility sites. The
distance between the westernmost and easternmost locations is about 7.3 miles (in a
direct line), and the northernmost and southernmost locations are about 2.6 miles apart.
The proposed horizontal footprint of the proposed facilities will be entirely included in
the five marked locations or within areas previously investigated as part of the larger
BDL Project, conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit 5950 (Davis et al. 2014). The
proposed work could be as deep as six feet below the current ground surface. Details of
each location are presented below:
1) Lake Operations Center on the west side of County Road (CR) 2945; 37
acres, (Figures 3 and 4)
2) FM 897 Boat Ramp on the east side of CR 2945; 8.7 acres, (see Figures 3
and 4)
3) North Boat Ramp on the west side of Farm-to-Market (FM) 1396; 10.9
acres, (Figures 5 and 6)
4) South Boat Ramp on the southwest side of FM 1396; 10.8 acres, (Figures
7 and 8)

5) Dam Maintenance Facility (DMF) on the south side of CR 2725; 8 acres,
(Figures 9 and 10)

Funding for this project will be provided through the NTMWD, a political subdivision of
the State of Texas, and the proposed project will take place on public land controlled by
NTMWD or Fannin County. Therefore, work is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT). However, coordination with the United States Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) will not be required prior to construction of the lake facility sites,
and the requirements of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966,
as amended (Section 106), will not apply to this project (Appendix A). Nevertheless,
the project was conducted to meet Section 106 standards The field survey included
both archeological and above-ground historic-age resource investigations. The Area of
Potential Effects (APE) under the ACT is defined as the footprint of the entire proposed
construction, up to a maximum depth of six feet.

Under subcontract to Freese and Nichols, Inc., AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra)
surveyed the entire APE under Antiquities Permit No. 8971. Previous cultural resources
investigations have been completed for the proposed reservoir, which overlaps a small
portion of the APE (Davis et al. 2014, Sitters and Feit 2016). Those investigations involved
visual inspection, systematic shovel testing and backhoe trenching around Bois d’Arc
Creek. Therefore, while AmaTerra’s cultural resources survey for the lake facility sites
visually inspected the entire 75.4 acre APE, systematic subsurface testing only occurred
in areas not previously surveyed (Appendix B). Right-of-entry was available for the
entire project area.

Fieldwork took place in June of 2019. Mindy Bonine was the project’s Principal
Investigator and Adam Parker served as the Project Archeologist. Sara Southern and
Garrett Wheaton assisted with field investigations. A total of 56 hours were expended
in the field in support of this project. As a result of field efforts, a total of 56 shovel tests
were excavated within the APE. At the time of the field visit, two of the locations appeared
to be previously disturbed from grading of surface soils with the disturbance reaching
a depth of 30–60 centimeters. Soils within the APE consisted primarily of Ellis clays,
Whakana very fine sandy loams, Porum loams, Freestone-Hicota complex loams, and
Normangee clay loam. A dense clay horizon below sandy soil was encountered at 40–60
centimeters below the surface (cmbs) within the majority of these shovel tests, while
other areas contained slightly deeper, loamy soils to 80 cmbs. No backhoe trenching was
conducted within the APE during the project’s initial phase of survey.
On September 10–11, 2019, a Gradall was deployed to scrape near—but outside of—
the historic-aged Cross Cemetery’s mapped boundary, located adjacent to the project’s
proposed Lake Operations Center. The investigations were conducted in response to the
Texas Historical Commission’s comments on the project’s original review draft report
(letter, Rebecca Shelton to Mindy Bonine, 9/3/2019). Two long, shallow trenches were
placed north of the boundary while two more were placed to the boundary’s south
(four total). None of the trenches contained evidence of human burials or any other
significant archeological deposits. The results of this supplemental field investigation are
summarized in this report as Appendix C.

As a result of field efforts, investigators documented two new archeological sites both
within the DMF project area. Site 41FN279 consists of a displaced historic debris scatter
in a small hollow above a pond. Site 41FN280 is a small surface scatter of historic-age
artifacts near a fenceline. Neither site contained features or indications of significant
deposits. Both sites appear to be secondary deposits from the farm complex to the north.
The Principal Investigator recommends that the proposed project would not affect any
State Antiquities Landmark (SAL)-eligible resources documented during the survey.
Gradall scrapes north of the mapped Cross Cemetery boundary were devoid of evidence of
human burial, suggesting that construction within the proposed Lake Operations Center
footprint as depicted in this report are not likely to impact marked or unmarked human
burials or any other components of the Cross Cemetery. A lack of any non-cemeteryrelated artifacts or features reinforces the Principal Investigator’s recommendations

from the pedestrian survey that construction at the Lake Operations Facility will not
likely impact any SAL-eligible resources.

No artifacts were collected during the survey. All project-generated notes, forms,
photographs, and other materials will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.
This report is broken into six chapters. The environmental setting and historical
background are discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, respectively. Chapter 4 includes the field
methodology implemented during the project, while the results of field investigations are
discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 presents the summary and recommendations.

Environmental Setting
2.1

Ecoregions and Vegetation

The project area is located in northern Fannin County, which falls within the border
of two ecoregions: the Northern Blackland Prairies ecoregion and the Northern Post
Oak Savanna ecoregion (Omernik and Griffith 2009). The Northern Blackland Prairies
is characterized by rolling hills and flat plains underlain by limestone, chalk and shale
beds of Cretaceous age (Omernik and Griffith 2009, Stahl and McElvaney 2012). The
average annual rainfall is approximately 35–45 inches (Stahl and McElvaney 2012). The
Blackland Prairies region was historically characterized as a prairie consisting of tall
grasses, productive soils, and gentle topography; however, much of the region is currently
comprised of crop land and other agriculture activities (Texas Parks and Wildlife 2019).
The Northern Post Oak Savanna ecoregion is generally characterized by irregular plains
populated by post oak savanna vegetation rather than the more open prairie to the south
(Omernik and Griffith 2009). The terrain at this location is generally level to gentlyrolling, overlying Eocene and Paleocene-age formations and soils with a higher moisture
content than areas to the south. The average annual rainfall is 40–48 inches. Post oak,
blackjack oak, black hickory, and grass species populate this region. Its modern land use
is a combination of cattle grazing and minor cropland (Omernik and Griffith 2009, Stahl
and McElvaney 2012).

The Northern Blackland Prairies ecoregion is dominated by mid to tall grasses such as
little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), Indian
grass (Sorghastrum nutans), tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper), eastern gamagrass
(Tripsacum dactyloides), and switch grass (Panicum virgatum), which are the natural
vegetative species for this environment (Omernik and Griffith 2009). In addition, pecan
(Carya illinoinensis), hackberry (Celtis laevigata), elm (Ulmus sp.), eastern cottonwood
(Populus deltoides), and bur and Shumard oak (Quercus macrocarpa and shumardii) are
often observed within the low flat woodlands along streams located within the Northern
Blackland Prairie. Since the nineteenth century, human land modifications along with
ranching/grazing activities have resulted in a dramatic increase in other flora species
(e.g., mesquite, ash juniper and eastern red cedar) (Stahl and McElvaney 2012). Today
the area is associated most strongly with cropland (Frye et al. 1984). The deciduous
forest or woodland of the Northern Post Oak Savanna is composed mostly of post oak
(Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), eastern redcedar (Juniperus
virginiana), and black hickory (Carya texana). The understory can include yaupon (Ilex
vomitoria), farkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), winged elm (Ulmus alata), and American
beautyberry (Callicarpa americana). Prairie openings contain similar grasses and forbs
as the Northern Blackland Prairies.

2.2

Climate

The climate within both ecoregions is described as subtropical with hot, usually humid
and wet summers with mild to cool winters (Peel et al. 2007). Annually, the APE receives
approximately 38–47 inches of precipitation with a mean annual air temperature of 64
degrees Fahrenheit (USDA-NRCS 2019).

2.3

Topography

The project area is situated on either side of Bois D’Arc Creek and its associated floodplain.
Topographically, each of the five locations is about 1–1.4 miles away from the creek itself,
and each location is about 50 feet or higher above the current flat, wide, floodplain.
All of the locations are situated on upland knolls overlooking the floodplain, which is
intersected by smaller creeks and streams that feed Bois D’Arc Creek. The topography of
the project area appears to match the descriptions of the ecoregions, with the northern
side of Bois D’Arc Creek exhibiting flatter terrain above the floodplain while the southern
side is much more undulating.

2.4

Geology and Soils

According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas (USGS 2019), the Lake Operations Center and
FM 897 Boat Ramp are located on Blossom Sand (Kbl) with Fluviatile terrace deposits
(Qt) at the top of the landform; the North Boat Ramp and the DMF are situated on the
Bonham Formation (Kbn/Kbo); and the South Boat Ramp is located within Blossom
Sand area (Kbl). The Bonham Formation and Blossom Sand are both Late Cretaceous
aged and comprised of marl and clay, or quartz sand. The Fluviatile terrace deposits are
Pleistocene and Holocene in age and are comprised of sand, silt, clay, and gravels on high
terrace deposits (Figures 11–14).
Recorded soils (USDA-NCSS 2019) are variable within each location (outlined below).

Ellis clays are found on ridges and slopes and consist of clay to at least 44 inches below
the surface; Whakana very fine sandy loams, Freestone-Hicota complex loams, and Porum
loams are located on river and stream terraces with a combination of sand to sandy loam
or loam to clay loam; and Normangee clay loam is located on ridges and summits which
comprise clay loam and clay (Figures 15–18). Where Holocene soils are present, they are
generally shallow (15–25 centimeters) overlying dense subsoils.

2.5

Current Site Setting

The APE is largely characterized by a mix of pasture land use and woodland. Specifically,
the Lake Operations Center contains a combination of pasture on the flat hilltop and
wooded areas where the land slopes down to the north and west. The path of the proposed
new right-of-way (ROW) for the previously surveyed and coordinated Farm-to-Market
(FM) 897 cuts through the middle of this area, and the construction of this roadway could
be seen during the field visit (Figure 19; Sitters and Feit 2016). The mapped perimeter of
the Cross Cemetery includes an area about 0.35 acres in size (50 m [N-S] by 54 m [E-W]),
and is located to the south of the Lake Operations Center, just outside of the project area.
The FM 897 Boat Ramp contains cleared land as well as a large farm complex with a large
barn, three additional outbuildings, livestock pens, and three silos on hilltop terrain. A
farm complex also appears on the 1955 aerial photograph of the area, but the buildings
represented on that photograph do not match the current configuration. It is apparent
that substantial modifications to the complex have been made over the years. The North
Boat Ramp contains portions of three small ponds within an otherwise flat surface that
is largely wooded. The South Boat Ramp is situated on a cleared hilltop (south side)
and adjacent drainage slope (north side) with slightly thicker vegetation. The western
portion of the DMF is located on a hilltop, which slopes down to the east to a large pond
just outside of the APE. The entire area has been cleared of upper-story vegetation and
one small outbuilding is located on the property.

Cultural Background And
Previous Cultural Studies
The project area is situated within the north-central Texas archeological region
(Perttula 2004). Typically, cultural chronology is divided into four major periods of time:
Paleoindian (11,000–8500 years before the present [BP]), Archaic (8500–1250 BP),
Late Prehistoric (1250–250 BP), and Historic (350 BP to present) (Prewitt 1981). The
Prehistoric periods are principally defined by the presence of diagnostic projectile points
and other technologies, but are intended to delineate change in socio-cultural patterns.
However, cultural change proceeded at somewhat different rates over the vast area of
Texas; in some regions, hunting and gathering cultures persisted throughout prehistory;
in others, cultures with farming and settled village life dominated. Prehistoric cultures
in north-central Texas appeared to maintain a hunter-gatherer lifestyle throughout the
Archaic and into the Late Prehistoric Period, with moderate changes in technology.

3.1

Cultural Background

3.1.1 Paleoindian
The earliest known time of human occupation in North America is the Paleoindian
Period. In north Texas, it is generally considered to date from about 11,000 to about 8500
BP. The archeological evidence suggests that during this time the earliest residents of
north-central Texas were highly nomadic hunters and gatherers (Brown and Lebo 1991).
Populations were likely small and dispersed, exploiting a variety of wild food resources.
Inhabitants of the region relied on a generalized hunting and gathering subsistence
economy utilizing a highly technical lithic technology. Large leaf-shaped projectile points,
such as the widespread Clovis projectile point are diagnostic of this time period and
suggest that mega-fauna such as extinct mastodon were key resources.
Archeological sites dating to this period are often found deeply buried near water sources.
A small number of archeological sites dating to the Paleoindian Period are known to
exist in north-central Texas. Paleoindian cultural materials have been observed within
channelized portions of the Sulphur River in southeast Fannin County, Texas.

3.1.2 Archaic

Much of Texas’ prehistory is subsumed within the Archaic Period, a long time span
dominated by hunting and gathering societies. The Archaic Period has been dated in
north-central Texas as occurring between 8500 BP and 1250 BP. The Archaic Period
is subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500–6000 BP), the Middle Archaic (6000–3500
BP), and the Late Archaic (3500–1250 BP) subperiods. Each of these subdivisions has

characteristic types of artifacts, especially projectile points, which suggest differences in
economy and possibly regional affiliations. The period is also notable for the introduction
of grinding implements and ground-stone ornaments.
Climatic patterns fluctuated during the Archaic Period and were generally warmer than
the Paleoindian Period. At the beginning of the Archaic Period, the global climate began
to change slowly, becoming gradually warmer and dryer (Brown and Lebo 1991). In
response, plant and animal populations changed (e.g., size, range, etc.) and the human
populations in north-central Texas adapted by increasing their diet breadth. Large
game was no longer the primary focus of subsistence. Changes in technology included a
more diverse suite of lithic tools, increased use of grinding stones and the development
of basketry. Pottery is absent. This shift in technology indicates a gradually increasing
population that utilized abundant plant and animal resources of environments similar to
those of modern times.

3.1.3 Late Prehistoric

During the Late Prehistoric Period (1250–250 BP), major changes in technology were
adopted by the people living in north-central Texas. The development of ceramics and the
introduction of the bow and arrow altered the economic strategies and social structures
of these Prehistoric populations. Also during this time, cultigens such as maize appeared
in the diet (Brown and Lebo 1991). Settlement patterns also changed, shifting to larger
villages that included houses. Evidence suggests that around 1060 BP the climate in northcentral Texas became somewhat drier (Ferring and Yates 1997). Bison are largely absent
from archeological sites during the first half of the Late Prehistoric Period; however,
they eventually spread out over the plains of north Texas and became a vital subsistence
resource (Brown and Lebo 1991).

3.1.4 Historic Period

Europeans entered Texas starting around AD 1528, but visited only sporadically, and
did not settle until around AD 1700 (Webb 1952). In response to the continuous threat
of Apache and Comanche raiders, as well as the French incursion into East Texas, the
Spaniards erected a series of missions and presidios in Texas during the eighteenth century.
Eventually, the newly independent Mexican government began granting impresario
contracts to allow more prominent Anglo settlement to facilitate development. Stephen
F. Austin, one such settler, eventually spearheaded a movement by Anglo and Mexican
settlers against Mexican authority and towards independence.
Anglo American settlers first came to present-day Fannin County in the mid 1830s to
lay claim to land grants offered by the Mexican—and later the Texas—government. Two
colonies were formed in these early years: one on the Red River and another on Bois d’
Arc Creek near what would become Bonham (Pigott 2019). In December 1837, Fannin
County was formed by the Texas legislature, though its present-day boundaries were not

drawn until 1846. Early settlers often clashed with local Native Americans. Continuous
Indian raids in the late 1830s and early 1840s forced many settlers into or nearby one of
three protective forts in the county: Fort Warren, Fort Inglish, and Fort Lyday (Strickland
1930). The Treaty of Bird’s Fort, signed in 1846, largely ended hostilities (Pigott 2019).
In the decades leading up to the Civil War, Fannin County remained relatively sparsely
populated, reaching a population of 9,217 by 1860. The local economy relied on agriculture,
particularly cattle, corn, and cotton (Pigott 2019). Fannin County grew quickly from the
end of the Civil War to the beginning of the twentieth century.

Immigration from other states (particularly southern states), increased during this
time, especially after the first railroad was built in Fannin County in 1873. This was the
Transcontinental division of the Texas and Pacific Railroad that extended from Texarkana
west to Fort Worth (Hymer 2019).

The current project is located in northeastern Fannin County, which was very sparsely
populated until the late nineteenth century. Following the Civil War, agriculture
continued to dominate the local economy, shifting to corn and cotton production, with
corn production peaking in 1900. Efforts were made throughout the Great Depression
and into World War II to increase dairy production within the county, but it never made
the desired stronghold. Beef cattle fared better and their numbers continued to grow
(Pigott 2012). No communities were located in the immediate vicinity of any of the
recreation area locations, but the closest communities are White Shed, Allen’s Chapel,
and Allen’s Point. Allen Point was founded in 1836, when Tennessean Wilson B. Allen
established a homestead near Honey Grove Creek and a crossing called Allen’s Point. The
success of Allen’s sugarcane farm attracted other farmers to the area. Soon thereafter, the
settlers organized Methodist and Baptist churches in the county. The Methodist church
was built about five miles west of Allen’s Point and called Allen’s Chapel, where a separate
community grew. Allen’s Point has served area farmers as a school and church community,
as well as a centralized location for cotton gins. However, neither Allen’s Point nor Allen’s
Chapel held populations exceeding 100 persons (Minor 2010).

Previously Recorded Cultural Resource Information

3.2.1 Previously Recorded Sites and Surveys
According to the Texas Historical Commission’s Online Sites Atlas (Atlas 2019), no National
Register-listed properties or districts, and no Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs),
are located within one kilometer of the five locations that comprise the project area. One
large survey, two linear surveys, one archeological site, and one historic cemetery are
located either within, adjacent to, or very near the project area.

Cultural Resources Survey of the North Texas Municipal Water District’s
Lake Facility Sites, Fannin County, Texas

Of note, Atlas records indicate that archeologists from AR Consultants, Inc. surveyed
numerous large areas either directly adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of the
currently-proposed project as part of the BDL Project. In fact, portions of the construction
footprints for the Lake Operations Center and FM 897 Boat Ramp, the North Boat Ramp,
and the DMF are located in the previously investigated areas associated with this project
(see Appendix B). Fieldwork was conducted for this large-scale project in 2013, and the
final report was submitted in late 2014 (Antiquities Permit 5950; Davis et al. 2014).
The project was conducted on behalf of NTMWD to satisfy the requirements of the ACT
and Section 106. In this report, the authors indicate that about 16,526 acres will be
inundated by the proposed lake project, and that a sampling strategy was employed to
assess the project’s impact to cultural resources. About 5,000 acres were investigated by
archaeologists, and 58 sites were recorded. The survey areas consisted of large blocks in
select areas as well as more linear tracts along stream channels and along the proposed
shoreline of the lake. In the description of each proposed survey location below, more
specific information is presented relating to this investigation.
Lake Operations Center: No archaeological sites have been recorded within one
kilometer of this location (Figure 20). However, one recorded historic-age cemetery is
located adjacent to the southern edge of the proposed Lake Operations Center. The Cross
Family cemetery is located on private property and contains four marked graves dating
from 1851–1911 and several unmarked children’s graves. The cemetery location is
contained within a wooded area and surrounded on the north and east sides (those sides
closest to the current survey) by an open field. The cemetery had been investigated as
part of the proposed realignment of FM 897 (Sitters and Feit 2016), including a backhoe
scrape along the eastern side of the cemetery within the proposed right-of-way. The
surveyors determined that the cemetery was well maintained with fenced perimeters,
and likelihood that unmarked graves present outside of the cemetery boundary and
within the FM 897 right-of-way appeared to be low (Sitters and Feit 2016:19–22). On the
north side of the Lake Operations Center location, a linear survey and areal block were
investigated for the BDL Project.
FM 897 Boat Ramp: No archaeological sites have been recorded within one kilometer
of this location (see Figure 20). On the northeast side of this location, a linear survey and
areal block were investigated for the BDL Project.

North Boat Ramp: Four archaeological sites are located within 0.35 km of this location,
and an additional five sites were recorded within one kilometer (Figure 21). All were
recorded during the BDL Project, in an areal survey that includes the southern half of
this location. Sites 41FN95, 41FN97, 41FN100, and 41FN102, sites closest to the North
Boat Ramp location, are all located in a cluster about 270 x 100 m in size to the southeast
of the proposed survey location. The four sites were all historic-age and determined to
be ineligible for listing on the National Record of Historic Places (NRHP). Site 41FN95
consisted of a historic-age barn with no associated artifacts nearby, site 41FN97 included
a historic-age outbuilding with mid-to-late twentieth century artifacts, site 41FN100
contained a historic-age house and outbuildings with an associated historic surface trash
scatter, and site 41FN102 consisted of a historic-age house that had been moved from
elsewhere. No subsurface artifacts were found with structure.

Sites 41FN98 and 41FN104 are located farther to the southeast near each other. Site
41FN98 included a historic-age church building and 41FN104 consisted of a historic-age
store building. Sites 41FN155 and 41FN156 were plotted to the east of the North Shore
Recreation Area location.
Site 41FN155 is a historic artifact scatter that is likely a dump of twentieth century
material, and site 41FN156 is recorded as a historic-age farmstead with a collapsed
structure and foundation piers and an associated artifact scatter dating to the twentieth
century. Site 41FN154, to the northeast, is another possible farmstead as indicated by
a scatter of historic-age trash and lumber. The Carson-Gum Springs Cemetery is also
located within one kilometer of this project area location.

South Boat Ramp: One archaeological site was recorded within 0.3 km of this location,
and another four sites were recorded within one kilometer (Figure 22). All were recorded
during the BDL Project (Davis et al. 2014). Site 41FN158 is located approximately 300
meters to the northwest corner of the South Boat Ramp and contains a cistern, foundation
piers, trash pile, and artifact scatter marking the location of a possible early twentieth
century farmstead.

Sites 41FN106, 41FN107, 41FN108, and 41FN109 are all located in a cluster to the
east of the proposed South Boat Ramp, contained in an area 200 m in diameter. Sites
41FN106 and 41FN107 were recorded as historic trash scatters. Site 41FN108 consists
of a historic well/cistern and surface scatter that was likely the location of a farmstead.
Site 41FN109, a twentieth century farmstead, was also tested by AR Consultants, Inc. in
2016 to determine it if was eligible for listing on the NRHP (Permit Number 7403). The
site boundary was determined to be 0.67 acres and the artifacts were determined to date
from the 1920s to the 1960s. It was determined to be not eligible for listing on the NRHP.

DMF: One archaeological site was recorded directly adjacent to this location on the
other side of the roadway, and another three sites were recorded within one kilometer
(Figure 23). All four sites were recorded in 2013 during an investigation of a large area
as part of the extensive BDL Project. This previously surveyed area abuts the northern
portion of the DMF. Site 41FN159 consists of two barns in a fenced enclosure east of
the road and an associated shed west of the road. Artifacts found at the site included
brick fragments, whiteware, stoneware, and porcelain body sherds, clear and amber
glass fragments (vessel and window glass), wire nails, wire fragments, fence staples, and
miscellaneous metal fragments. The shed on the west side of the road is the component that
abuts the DMF location. According to Davis et al. (2014:286), this shed was constructed at
this location some time between 1984 and 1996. A structure in a similar location is visible
on earlier imagery but it is not oriented the same way as the extant structure, nor is it as
close to the two-track road as that depicted on historic imagery. Sites 41FN137, 41FN138,
and 41FN142 are all located to the northwest of the DMF location. Sites 41FN137 and
41FN138 were recorded as multi-component sites with buried prehistoric lithic scatters
topped by historic farm related structures (including barns and a cistern). Site 41FN142
marked the location where a local collector identified a lithic quarry site, but no evidence
of the quarry could be determined at the time of the field visit.

Another linear survey was conducted in 2014 to the northeast of this location as part of
a Lower Bois D’Arc Creek Lake Pipeline project by AR Consultants, Inc. (Permit Number
6626). No sites were recorded during that investigation.

All of the archaeological sites documented above were determined to be Not Eligible for
listing on the NRHP or as SALs.

3.2.2 Historic-Age Map and Aerial Imagery Interpretation

A 1940 Fannin County Highway map was located during a search for historic maps of the
project area (Texas State Highway Department [TSHD] 1940). However, at each location,
the current road pattern does not match the historic road pattern, and it appears that
the roadways themselves have changed significantly since 1940. Generally, the jagged
edges and sharp corners of roadways have been smoothed over the years, but this did not
occur until the late 1950s. At the scale of the 1940 highway map, details concerning each
location could not be rectified.

Aerial photographs dating to 1955 were much easier to match to the project areas. They
depict no observable standing structures within the Lake Operations Center (Figure 24).
The FM 897 Boat Ramp contains three large standing structures, possibly a house and
two barns, and with up to two smaller sheds and various hay bales. The possible house is
located closest to the roadway, and a dirt road leads towards the back of the property (see
Figure 24). The North Boat Ramp does not contain any standing structures on the 1955
aerial photograph (Figure 25).
The South Boat Ramp contains an outbuilding of some type, possibly a barn, near the
eastern side of the project area (Figure 26). The DMF location depicts two structures,
possibly a house with a hip-roof and an adjacent outbuilding, and a square fenced area
further to the west. A dirt road passes by these items (Figure 27).

Two additional Fannin County highway maps were found for the mid-twentieth century,
dating to 1957 (TSHD 1961[revised]) and 1962 (TSHD 1972 [revised]). Interestingly,
although the road pattern could be matched to the current configuration, no buildings
were depicted on the maps in the vicinity of the five project area locations. After 1972,
buildings were no longer depicted on the Fannin County Highway Map.

Methodology
Cultural resource investigations generally followed the prescribed minimum standards
for areal projects of this type consisting of controlled surface transects supplemented
with subsurface shovel tests. In addition, architectural historians utilized field data
gathered by the archeology crew to view the potentially-affected non-archeological
resources, then evaluated the project’s effects on those cultural resources separately
from the archeological analysis.

4.1

Archeological Pedestrian Survey Methodology

During the archeological component of the investigations, archeologists adhered to the
Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA’s) minimum standards for 100 percent intensive
survey of areal projects. The surveys employed a shovel test density of two tests per acre
for those locations under 10 acres (n=2), and one for every two acres for those greater
than 10 acres (n=3). Shovel test frequency was increased or decreased depending on field
conditions, archeological probability, and evidence of previous disturbance. For instance,
some of the locations were found to contain heavily eroded, sloping soils that would not
contain Holocene age material. As noted earlier, two locations appeared to be previously
disturbed from grading of surface soils. The section of FM 897 that had been investigated
in 2016 and traversed the Lake Operations Center was found to be under construction
(see Figure 19 ; see Appendix C for a full summary of Gradall scraping around Cross
Cemetery). The DMF had also undergone some modifications that had disturbed a portion
of the project area.

Each shovel test was excavated by hand in roughly 20-centimeter levels to: 1) the
predetermined maximum depth of 80 centimeters, 2) to clearly visible, sterile subsoil
or bedrock, or 3) to evidence of disturbance; whichever circumstance was reached first.
Soils were screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth whenever possible, though dense
sticky clays dictated that many shovel tests were also hand-sorted. Non-site shovel
test locations and observations were recorded on standardized logs and mapped using
handheld GPS units. Each test record included observations for topographic location, soil
stratigraphy, evidence of disturbance, and any artifacts observed. Once recording was
complete, each test was immediately backfilled.
Archeological Site Recording

Once identified, archeological field crews recorded sites following standard recording
protocols outlined in the THC’s Archeological Survey Standards within the framework
of on-site conditions. Field notes and photographs were collected while site data was
recorded on standardized TexSite forms. Site boundaries (both horizontal and vertical)
were defined through subsurface tests, extent of surface deposits, and/or topographic
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

41

Cultural Resources Survey of the North Texas Municipal Water District’s
Lake Facility Sites, Fannin County, Texas

observation. Locational information (features, fencelines, shovel tests, etc.) were recorded
within sites using a combination of compass and pace, hand-drawn maps and the handheld GPS units. For the purposes of this survey, an archeological site would have had to
contain a certain number of cultural materials or features older than 50 years within
a given area. The definition of a site is: (1) five or more surface artifacts within a 15-m
radius, (2) a single cultural feature, such as a hearth, burned rock midden or historic-age
cistern, observed on the surface or exposed during shovel testing, (3) a positive shovel
test containing at least five total artifacts, or (4) two positive shovel tests located within
30 m of each other.

Site definition standards complied with THC/CTA survey standards and policy, including
requirements for assessing historic archeological sites and identifying historic cemeteries.
Specific site information was recorded on standardized forms and presented to the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for inclusion in their archives and, if necessary,
production of new site trinomials.
Artifacts found were field catalogued and documented through notes, representative
photographs, and drawings in accordance with survey-level site significance and integrity
assessment, then returned to their original locations. Historic-age artifacts were inspected
for temporally diagnostic attributes such as maker’s marks, decorative motifs, materials,
and manufacturing techniques. No artifacts were collected during the survey. Artifacts
with a long manufacturing history well into the late twentieth century were assumed to
be less than 50 years of age unless another associated artifact was encountered to place
the assemblage as a whole into the early twentieth century.

In general, historical archeological sites are documented through field efforts and survey
level archival research. This research includes an attempt to determine the history of
ownership and land use for each site through oral interviews, deed research, and
map research. However, as will be documented in the Results section, the historic-age
archeological sites found and recorded during this investigation were determined to
be associated with a previously recorded site 41FN159, a farm complex to the north of
the sites, as well as other associated now-destroyed buildings likely associated with the
complex as well. Archival research for the entire property had been conducted as part
of the Bois d’Arc Lake Project (Davis et al. 2014), and the relevant information is also
presented here. As such, additional archival research was not conducted.

4.2

Historic Structures Analysis Methods

To assist in complying with Section 106 if future coordination is necessary, architectural
historians evaluated the project’s potential to impact non-archaeological, historic-age
cultural resources within the area of potential indirect effects (APE-indirect). The APEindirect investigation included all resources 45 years of age or older (ca. 1973) within
and adjacent to the five project areas. The archaeological survey team photo-documented
any above-ground structures encountered during the field investigation for analysis by
the architectural historian. The architectural historian reviewed the photographs to
determine the structure’s age and condition.

4.3

Resource Evaluation Criteria

4.3.1 NRHP Evaluation Criteria
In order to be considered for listing in the NRHP, buildings, structures, objects, sites,
and districts must meet standards of significance defined by the Keeper of the National
Register (36 CFR 60). Each property must be evaluated within the framework of its
historic context and it must retain characteristics that make it a good representative
of properties associated with that aspect of the past. The NRHP Criteria for Evaluation
state that—the quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,
engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects
that possess integrity of location, setting, design, materials, workmanship, feeling, and
association, and:
• Are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
• Are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or

• Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction
or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction; or
• Have yielded or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory or
history.

Criterion A

A resource that is representative of an important trend or event may be eligible for the
NRHP under Criterion A. This broad definition provides flexibility when determining the
kinds of significant historical associations. However, a property is not eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP simply because it was built during an important era in history or if it fulfilled
its historic role. In order for a property to be eligible for Criterion A, it must be significant
under one or more defined historic context(s), convey a sense of the past, and remain
recognizable to the period in which it was first constructed or achieved significance.
Criterion B

Criterion B applies to properties associated with individuals whose specific contributions
to history can be identified and documented. However, it is important to determine
not only what contributions are associated with the individual and how they compare
with those of other persons, but also how the property represents or is linked to that
individual and his or her accomplishments. The extent and duration of that association is
particularly important for determining NRHP eligibility. Moreover, the significance of that
person must be associated with the contextual themes defined in this report. Properties
significant under NRHP Criterion B should be those most closely associated with a person
who has made important contributions to the past, be associated with the person during
the time he or she achieved significance, and convey a strong sense of the past and remain
recognizable to the period in which the person achieved significance.
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

43

Cultural Resources Survey of the North Texas Municipal Water District’s
Lake Facility Sites, Fannin County, Texas

Criterion C
Properties eligible for the NRHP under Criterion C derive significance from the physical
qualities of their design, construction, and/or craftsmanship, including such elements as
architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, and art. To be eligible under Criterion
C, a property must embody distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction; represent the work of a master; possess high artistic value; or represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction
(a historic district). A property significant under Criterion C is one that clearly represents
a noteworthy example of a defined property type, dates from the period of significance
of one or more historic context(s), and exhibits the character-defining features of its
property type. Therefore, a property must retain a high degree of physical integrity, as
well as having a relation to the historic context.
Criterion D

The last of the four NRHP Criteria deals with the significance of resources that have the
potential to yield important information about the past. Criterion D is applied most often
to archeological resources, but it also may be used to evaluate the significance of extant
buildings and structures. Properties significant under this criterion are those that have
the ability to yield important historic information, such as a rare type of construction. In
order for these types of properties to be eligible under Criterion D, they must themselves
be, or must have been, the principal source of the important information, such as how
construction expertise affected the evolution of local building development. Due to the
nature of the reconnaissance level survey, evaluation under Criterion D is generally
excluded unless historians feel a particular property warrants additional investigation or
consideration. Alternatively, Criterion D is most often used by archeologists to evaluate
prehistoric and historic-age archeological sites for their NRHP eligibility.

4.3.2 Criteria Considerations

On occasion, certain types of resources are also evaluated that are not normally considered
eligible for the NRHP. These resources include religious properties, structures moved
from original locations, birthplaces and graves, cemeteries, reconstructed buildings,
commemorative properties, and properties achieving significance within the last fifty
years. These properties can qualify for inclusion in the NRHP if they meet specific Criteria
Considerations, in addition to meeting the regular requirements:
• A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic
distinction or historical importance; or

• A building or structure removed from its original location but which is significant
primarily for architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most
importantly associated with a historic person or event; or

• A birthplace or grave of a historical Figure of outstanding importance if there is no
appropriate site or building directly associated with his or her productive life; or
44

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Chapter 4

• A cemetery which derives its primary significance from graves of persons of
transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from
association with historic events; or

• A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and
presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no
other building or structure with the same association has survived; or

• A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or symbolic
value has invested it with its own exceptional significance; or
• A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional
importance.

4.3.3 Seven Aspects of Integrity

In addition to being significant under one or more of the criteria listed above, a NRHPeligible property must also retain historic integrity of those features necessary to convey
its significance (US Department of the Interior 1998:3). The Keeper of the National Register
has identified and defined seven aspects of integrity by which potential candidates for
the NRHP must be measured (US Department of the Interior 1998:44-45):
• Location is the place where the historic property was constructed or the place
where the historic event occurred.

• Design is the combination of elements that create the form, plan, space, structure,
and style of a property.
• Setting is the physical environment of a historic property.

• Materials are the physical elements that were combined or deposited during a
particular period of time and in a particular pattern or configuration to form a
historic property.

• Workmanship is the physical evidence of the crafts of a particular culture of people
during any given period in history or prehistory.
• Feeling is a property’s expression of the aesthetic or historic sense of a particular
period of time.

• Association is the direct link between an important historic event, person, or period
and a historic property.

Determining which of these aspects of integrity are most important to a particular property
requires knowing why, where and when the property is significant (US Department of the
Interior 1998:48). For Criteria A or B eligibility, the aspects of location, feeling, setting, and
association take on greater importance in determining a property’s integrity. To be eligible
under these criteria, a property must be able to clearly convey its significant associations
with the historic context. This often requires that a property’s overall environment remain
relatively unaltered from its period of significance. Properties eligible for the NRHP under
Criterion C must retain a high degree of physical integrity, as well as retain some relation
to the historic context. The most important aspects of integrity for Criterion C eligibility
are location, design, materials, workmanship, and feeling.
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

45

Cultural Resources Survey of the North Texas Municipal Water District’s
Lake Facility Sites, Fannin County, Texas

At a minimum, a property eligible under Criteria A or B must retain its basic original
form that identifies its property type and must be generally recognizable to its period of
significance. However, the significance of properties under Criteria A or B is not derived
mainly from their design or construction value. Therefore, a greater amount of alteration
to a building’s historic physical features is allowable when compared to the more stringent
standards set for Criterion C eligibility. Some minor alterations to the physical fabric of
the building do not necessarily preclude Criterion C eligibility, although they may result
in some loss of integrity. Such acceptable alterations could include replacement of roof
materials or replacement of a minority of exterior doors and windows within the original
fenestration pattern of the building. In some cases, non-historic outbuildings or landscape
features could also be considered acceptable modifications to the property, if they are
visually unobtrusive and compatible in design and scale with the original building and
its setting. Major changes to a building’s roofline, form, or overall massing are generally
considered unacceptable, and would render a building not eligible under NRHP Criteria
A, B, and C.

4.3.4 SAL Evaluation Criteria

In addition to the National Register evaluation criteria outlined above, the ACT allows
for archeological resources to be evaluated for significance at the state level as SALs.
According to the ACT, any site located on state-owned land may be considered a SAL if it
meets any of the formal designation criteria (13 Texas Antiquities Code [TAC] 26.8):
• the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
• the site’s archeological deposits and artifacts within the state are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the
site;
• the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history
• the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;

• the high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur
and official landmark designation is needed to insure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism
and relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

Laboratory

All artifacts observed in the field were recorded on site and returned to their find location.
All field-generated forms, notes, photographs, and other materials were organized and
curated at TARL in Austin. In accordance with the accepted research design, no artifacts
were collected during field survey. When observed, all artifacts (or a representative
sample thereof) were recorded through field notes, drawings, and/or photographs then
returned to their find location.

Results of Field Investigations
During the course of three days of field survey, archeologists surveyed the entirety of
the project’s five locations and documented two new archaeological sites, 41FN279 and
41FN280. In addition, architectural historians reviewed the above-ground structures
within the FM 897 Boat Ramp as well as one house ruin found by the survey crew just
outside of the project area boundary at the North Boat Ramp. A total of 58 shovel tests
were excavated (Appendix D). A general summary of the intensive cultural resource
survey is presented below.

5.1

Archeological Survey

5.1.2 Lake Operations Center
The surveyed area was found to be a combination of open pasture surrounded by wooded
area. To the north, the ground sloped downward to a pond that occupied the “bump” in
the survey area, but otherwise the survey area was more level. Of note, the right-of-way
for FM 897 was under construction and had disturbed a swath of land through the center
of the survey area. Thus, the anticipated shovel test density of 18–19 shovel tests (one
shovel test per two acres) was reduced to 15 (Figure 28). These were excavated in evenly
spaced transects throughout the remainder of the project area. Soils observed consisted
of sand and sandy loam (10YR 3/2) over clay (7.5YR 4/6), with the transition at about
30–60 cmbs. No artifacts were recovered, and no surface artifact scatters or any standing
buildings were observed. Vegetation outside of the disturbed areas covered most of the
ground, with a 20 percent visibility.
The Cross Cemetery was located just south of the project area, which was investigated
in 2016 with field recording and backhoe scraping (Sitters and Feit 2016). The previous
investigators found a tidy cemetery with two fenced areas, one enclosing headstones and
one without surface markers. The backhoe scrape to the east of the cemetery boundary
did not locate any evidence of buried unmarked graves. A review of historic aerial
photographs of the area (see Figure 24) indicates the land to the north and east of the
cemetery have been under heavy cultivation since at least 1955, and most likely decades
earlier as well. The fenced areas, where the known burials are located, are situated near
the southeast corner of the cemetery boundary as depicted on the THC Atlas, adjacent to
where the 2016 scrape was placed (Figure 29).
AmaTerra staff conducted Gradall scrapes adjacent to the cemetery’s northern and
southern boundaries on September 10-11th, 2019. The northern scrapes were conducted
to assess the potential that proposed Lake Operations Center construction could impact
unmarked burials located beyond the mapped cemetery boundary.

Even though they were placed outside of any currently-known project impact footprint,
the scrapes to the south were excavated out of convenience since the equipment was
already in place to assist in constraints identification should future projects be planned to
the cemetery’s immediate south. The two scrapes to the north of the cemetery (GT 1N-2N)
were excavated, respectively, 7 and 10 meters beyond the mapped boundary, within the
proposed Lake Operations Center footprint. The scrapes were each approximately 50
meters long and two meters wide, extending to roughly one meter below the surface.
Trees and dense vegetation did not allow for full Gradall access to the cemetery’s south.
The scrapes to the south (GT 1S-2S) were placed 5 and 10 meters (respectively) south
of the mapped boundary. Each measured approximately 20-30 meters long and nearly
90 centimeters deep. Archeologists observed no evidence of human burials or any other
significant archeological resources within the scrapes within proposed Lake Operations
Center footprint or to the cemetery’s south.
This, in combination with the distance between the known burial locations and the
edge of the project area, and the localized knowledge of the landowner in avoiding the
cemetery when placing the agricultural field early in the twentieth century, leads to the
conclusion that unmarked burials are not located within the Lake Operations Center
survey footprint. See Appendix C for a full summary.

5.1.3 FM 897 Boat Ramp

The proposed FM 897 Boat Ramp was generally level containing several abandoned farm
buildings near the roadway and a slope downward to a farm pond along the northeast
side. The entire area had been cleared of upper-story vegetation, save for the southern
boundary. Short grasses covered the area, with surface visibility about 20–30 percent.
The abandoned farm complex consisted of one large gable roofed barn, about 25 x 30 feet
in size, along with a smaller gable-with-shed roofed outbuilding connected to a large area
covered by sheet metal and livestock pens. Three other flat-roofed outbuildings were
found close or adjacent to the livestock pens. Finally, three large silos were observed in
the center of the complex. The large farm complex and the slope dictated the placement
of the nine shovel tests (out of an anticipated 17) in this area (see Figure 28). Soils were
sandy clay loam (10YR 3/2) over sandy clay (10YR 6/2) at about 30 cmbs. No cultural
material was located in any of the shovel tests. The farm complex was evaluated by the
architectural historian and is described below.

5.1.4 North Boat Ramp

This location was found to be fairly level, with a scatter of trees and open areas. The area
was not observed to have been intentionally farmed, but portions of the property were
likely cleared at some point in the past, based on the age of the vegetation. One pond was
observed near the western edge of the project area, and two others were noted outside
of the area to the south. Surface visibility was less than 20 percent. Eight shovel tests
(slightly more than one shovel test per two acres) were excavated in the North Boat Ramp
(Figure 30). The soils were observed as sand and sandy loam (7.5YR 6/4) over sandy
clay (7.5YR 5/8), between 40–70 cmbs.

No cultural material was observed, and no artifacts were found on the ground surface.
Of note, a house ruin was found just outside of the project area to the southeast, about
30 m from shovel test SS13. The area around the house was covered by trees. Only one
fragment of window glass was found on the surface within the project area in the vicinity
of the house ruin. No artifacts were located in the three shovel tests placed near the edge
of the project area and nearest the ruin. The single artifact within the project area was
not sufficient to be considered an archaeological site. The ruin was evaluated by the
architectural historian and is described below.

5.1.5 South Boat Ramp

The South Boat Ramp contained a relatively level surface incised by a drainage running
east-to-west through the northern half of the project area. The remaining ground had
been cleared for cultivation. The ground was covered in low grasses, and visibility was
less than 20 percent. Six shovel tests (one shovel test per two acres) were placed on both
sides of the drainage on level ground (Figure 31). Soils encountered consisted of silty
clay loam (10YR 3/4) over clay loam (10YR 5/4), at depths ranging from 40–70 cmbs.
No cultural material was found in any of the shovel tests. In addition, no cultural material
was observed on the ground surface and no standing structures were seen in the project
area.

5.1.6 DMF

This location occupied the area to the south of the shed associated with Site 41FN159.
The land slopes gently downward from that point to a farm pond at the south side of
the project area, as well as to the west. The entire location had been cleared of upperstory vegetation and used as pasture or general storage areas. Several modifications to
the ground surface had been observed by the field crew, including a narrow dirt road
extending from the gravel road on the east side of the property. From that road, a drive to a
cleared staging area containing heavy construction equipment was observed. The staging
area crossed into the project area on the north side, and the new dirt road traversed
the project area from east to west. In addition, the area to the north of the farm pond
had been previously graded, to the point where the ground surface contained minimal
vegetation, and rivulets of water crossed the area to drain into the pond (Figure 32). The
entire area had a high surface visibility rate, about 80–100 percent.
A total of 20 shovel tests were excavated in the DMF, four of which contained cultural
material. The soils were deep near the farm pond, and sandy soils (7.5YR 6/4) were
observed to 80 cmbs. However, a lack of deep artifacts or extensive surface deposits in
this portion of the property suggest deeply-buried archeological resources are unlikely.
The remainder of the landscape contained silty or sandy loam (7.5YR 4/4) to about 30–40
cmbs, overlying clay loam or clay (7.5YR 5/6–5/8).

5.1.7 Site 41FN279
The four shovel tests containing cultural material was designated Site 41FN279
(Figure 33). The overall site area measured 35 x 40 m in size, with a maximum depth
of cultural material present at 35 cmbs. All of the observed artifacts were either historic
or modern, and consisted of domestic or farm material dating to the twentieth century.
Table 1 below presents the observed artifacts from the shovel tests. Many of the artifacts
have long manufacturing dates, but the overall assemblage indicates a typical early-tomid twentieth century residence (Figure 34).
The stoneware vessel was in common use before such storage containers were supplanted
by plastics in the 1950s–1960s (Figure 35), and the cream colored utility ware may have
been a “yellowware” fragment that was popular as late as the early twentieth century
(manufactured until around 1930), but the lack of any decoration on the fragment limits
a concrete temporal placement (Figure 36; Maryland Archaeological Conservation Lab
2015).

The artifacts were all found
in a low spot to the north
of the pond, with slopes
upward on the east and
west sides (Figure 37). The
location appeared to be a
shallow hollow or drainage,
and
the
depositional
integrity of the artifacts is
highly suspect. Of note, a
historic-age building with a
hipped roof (likely a house
and not a farm building)
was observed on the 1955

the north of this location
about 40 m from the site.
In addition, a shed associated with historic site 41FN159 is located slightly beyond the
hipped roof building to the north (about 80 m from site 41FN279). According to Davis et
al. (2014:286) the shed (Structure 18 in their report) that stands at this location now likely
dates to some time between 1984 and 1996. Earlier imagery, including the 1955 aerial
photograph depicted in Figure 33, do show a shed near what was listed as Structure 18
but the earlier depictions do not match the exact location or the structure’s orientation,
indicating that the extant shed is a replacement. The artifacts most likely washed down
from the deposits from these histoirc-age resources.

The hipped-roof house, along with a second smaller building and fenced area also seen
on the 1955 aerial photograph, is no longer present on the landscape. Indeed, it appears
that the recently constructed dirt road covers the area the house previously occupied.
These recent disturbances
may have contributed to the
redeposition of the artifacts
downslope,
and
this
constitutes all that remains
of this resource (Figure 38).
Given the poor condition
of the site’s integrity, it
would not contain sufficient
research potential for be
considered eligible for
listing on the NRHP or as a
SAL.

5.1.8 Site 41FN280
The second resource recorded by the field crew included a historic and modern trash
scatter observed in the northwest corner of the project area (Figure 39). The ground
surface contained 11 undecorated whiteware fragments, one aqua glass mason jar rim
fragment with a screw-cap closure (Figure 40), one clear bottle lip for a crown cap
closure (likely a soda bottle; Figure 41), and one unidentified ferrous fragment. All of
the artifacts, with the exception of the aqua colored mason jar fragment, have a long
manufacturing history well into the late twentieth (and twenty-first) century, and the
deposit may indeed be less than 45 years old. However, the presence of the mason jar
rim, which was manufactured in the aqua color from the nineteenth century to the late
1930s (Lindsey 2019), places at least one historic-age artifact in the assemblage. Thus, a
trinomial was assigned to the trash cluster.

The site area had previously been cleared of vegetation and visibility was close to 90
percent (Figure 42). Thus, no shovel tests were excavated immediately adjacent to the
scatter. The locations of the items were pinned and seven GPS coordinates were taken
of each to determine a possible pattern. The cluster was evenly distributed, but only
measured about 8 x 12 m in size, and no other artifacts were found surrounding it. Due to
the prior clearing of vegetation nearby and the apparent past use of the area upslope (the
fenced area to the immediate north had been used to store hay and was under regular
vehicle traffic), the items were likely to be disturbed and/or redeposited. The shed
associated with site 41FN159 is located about 90 m east of the scatter. Given the poor
condition of the site’s integrity, it would not contain sufficient research potential for be
considered eligible for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL.

According to Davis et al. (2014) and Fannin County records, the property containing site
41FN159 and both sites 41FN279 and 41FN280 is part of the original R. Pettet (Abstract
879) land grant, and the property containing these two historic artifact scatters is the
same as the property containing the southernmost shed of site 41FN159. This land grant
was divided into three different properties over the years, and several family names
that have been in the area since the late 1800s are connected to these properties, like
the Newhouses, Martins, and Jones. These families have connections to Greens Chapel/
Selfs community areas and could be important to the local area’s history (Dobbs 2008).
Oral history interviews conducted during the investigation of site 41FN159 (Davis et al.
2014:233, 287) revealed the likelihood that these two sites, as well as sites 41FN137 and
41FN138 (both to the northeast of site 41FN159), were all part of a larger ranching and
farming operation in the early to mid-20th century. The informant said that the location
of 41FN137 and 41FN159 were probably related to the African-American tenant farmers
that worked on the properties, and site 41FN138 was the home of the ranch owners (the
Rowton family). Davis et al. (2014:236, 289) recommended Sites 41FN137, 41FN138, and
41FN159 for further investigations to determine their NRHP/SAL eligibility, citing the
possibility of comparing the features and assemblages of contemporary white (41FN138)
and African-American (41FN137, 41FN159)occupations.

Site 41FN159, closest to 41FN279 and 41FN280, also contained a well/cistern, suggesting
that a residence could have been present at the time of occupation, further supporting
the recommendation. The close proximity of sites 41FN279 and 41FN280 to this large
ranching complex may indicate the source of the redeposited historic-age artifacts to
these locations. These sites, however, lack the associated features or general integrity of
the previously-recorded resources nearby. Therefore they do not rise to the significance
potential of 41FN137, 41FN138, or 41FN159. Should a larger comparative investigation
be conducted between these three sites, the scant, largely non-diagnostic assemblages
from 41FN279 and 41FN280 could supplement the analysis but the sites themselves do
not warrant NRHP or SAL designation.

5.2

Assessment of Non-Archeological
Cultural Resources

AmaTerra architectural historians reviewed two individual above-ground resources
within the project locations, one farm complex at the FM 897 Boat Ramp, and a house
ruin adjacent to the North Boat Ramp. Below is a summary of the above-ground resources
documented within the project area.

5.3

Farm Complex at the FM 897 Boat Ramp

The farm complex is modern (i.e., built within 45 years), with most of the components
built after 1976 (Figures 43–45, see Figure 28). The only building that appears on a
1976 aerial photograph (March and August) of the area is a cinderblock chicken coop
with the shed overhang on the east side. The circa 1975 concrete masonry unit (CMU)
building had been built on a concrete foundation with metal, fixed-frame windows, double
flush doors, and an open wood shed addition on the east side. The front-gabled roof was
observed with a shallow pitch with minimal eaves, corrugated metal roofing, and wood
siding under the gable ends.

5.4

House Ruin Near the Edge of the North Boat Ramp

The house ruin was difficult to assess due to its condition (see Figure 30). The underlying
construction consisted of traditional stud framing covered with vertical 1 x 12-inch solid
wood boards for the walls and roof. These construction materials would be typical for a
building constructed in the 1930s–1940s (Figures 46–47). The more modern materials
such as the roof tiles, false wood paneling, and rolled siding covering the framing and
sheathing were developed and implemented in the 1970s. The foundation was not clearly
visible.

Conclusions and Recommendations
AmaTerra investigators found the five proposed lake facility sites adjacent to the
proposed BDL to be devoid of significant cultural resources despite extensive shovel
testing, pedestrian survey, and historic resource review. Gradall scrapes adjacent to
the mapped Cross Cemetery boundary were devoid of evidence of unmarked burials or
any other significant cultural resources (Appendix C). Only four of the 58 shovel tests
excavated within the project area contained cultural material. The four shovel tests
containing artifacts were assigned trinomial 41FN279. A second site was located near
the first, and consisted of a surficial scatter of artifacts assigned trinomial 41FN280. Two
above-ground resources were reviewed for their architectural significance.

Site 41FN279 is a subsurface, historic-age artifact assemblage found in the DMF project
location, dating to the early-to-mid twentieth century. The artifacts were all found in a
low spot or swale to the north of a farm pond, with slopes upward on the east and west
sides and a more gradual slope northward. A historic-age building with a hipped roof
observed on a 1955 aerial photograph, as well as a shed associated with site 41FN159,
are located just to the north of this location. The artifacts most likely washed down from
these deposits. No features were found associated with the assemblage, and the entire
area had undergone ground disturbances in recent years. The site is most certainly a
secondary deposit of material, and the artifacts’ historic context has been permanently
altered.
Site 41FN280 marks the location of a surface historic and modern trash cluster observed
in the northwest corner of the DMF project location. The ground surface contained
approximately 14 observed artifacts, including an aqua mason jar rim fragment with
a screw-cap closure. Many of the artifacts have a long manufacturing history well
into the late twentieth (and twenty-first) century, but the aqua mason jar rim, which
was manufactured up to the late 1930s, places at least one historic-age artifact in the
assemblage. Thus, a trinomial was assigned to the trash scatter. As with site 41FN279,
due to prior clearing of vegetation nearby and the apparent use of the area upslope for
hay storage, as well as the proximity of site 41FN159 to the east, the items were likely to
be disturbed and/or redeposited. No features were found in the vicinity of the site.

Previous investigations (Davis et al. 2014) documented Sites 41FN137, 41FN138, and
41FN159 that are (particularly the latter) likely directly associated with Sites 41FN279
and 41FN280. The previously-recorded sites are attributed to an early-to-mid-20thcentury farming operation consisting of a ranch-owner’s family residence (41FN138;
the Rowton Family) and unnamed African-American tenant farmers (41FN137 and
41FN159). Citing the number and variety of artifacts within Site 41FN159 and the
presence of a well/cistern - itself an indicator of a possible former residential structure

- Davis et al. (2014) recommended further investigations to formally determine NRHP/
SAL eligibility. In addition, Davis et al. (2014) suggested that the three previouslyrecorded sites could be studied together to identify larger racial and social status
patterns through comparing the sites’ respective assemblages and features. While the
author acknowledges that Sites 41FN279 and 41FN280 are most likely associated with
these NRHP/SAL-undetermined sites, the resources observed during the current survey
lack the features, temporal diagnostics, or general integrity of Site 41FN159 (or the more
distant 41FN137 or 41FN138). Sites 41FN279 and 41FN280 are minor, largely secondarycontext surface scatters of almost entirely non-diagnostic historic-age artifacts that
would not meaningfully contribute to our understanding of the tenant farming operations
being conducted here during the first half of the 20th century. Any larger investigation
of the higher-quality sites immediately adjacent to the DMF would not likely benefit
substantially from preserving or individually investigating Sites 41FN279 or 41FN280
beyond the work that was conducted for this project and summarized here. Accordingly,
the Principal Investigator recommends that Sites 41FN279 and 41FN280 are not eligible
for listing on the NRHP or as SALs.
Two above-ground resources, a farm complex at the Lake Office Recreational Area and
a house ruin just outside the North Shore Recreational Area, were evaluated for their
architectural significance. They were found to be either modern in construction, or
lacking sufficient integrity to be eligible for the NRHP under Criterion C.

No further work is recommended at either of the archeological sites or above-ground
resource locations. Construction in this area is unlikely to impact significant archeological
or non-archeological cultural resources. Gradall scrapes to the north of the Cross Cemetery
suggest that unmarked burials do not likely extend outside of the mapped cemetery
boundary and into the proposed Lake Operations Center project footprint. Therefore, the
Principal Investigator requests the THC’s concurrence that project activities associated
with the above-described project will not likely impact Historic Properties and/or SALs,
including marked or unmarked human burials, and should proceed with no further
cultural resource fieldwork or coordination required.
In the unlikely event that significant archeological deposits are encountered during
construction, all work in the immediate vicnity shall cease until such time as the deposits
can be assessed by a professional archeologist and coordinated with the THC.

Summary of Antiquities Code of Texas
Compliance Gradall Trenching in
the Vicinity of the Cross Cemetery
for North Texas Municipal Water
District’s Proposed Lake Operations
Center, Fannin County, Texas
Antiquities Permit 8971;
Mindy Bonine, Principal Investigator
Maura Hogan, Field Director
Through coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC), it was determined that
standard pedestrian survey and shovel testing alone would not be sufficient to confirm
that North Texas Municipal Water District’s (NTMWD) proposed Lake Operations Facility
is not likely to impact unmarked burials associated with the historic-age Cross Cemetery.
Amaterra archeologists conducted backhoe scraping along the eastern boundary of
historically-mapped Cross Family cemetery in 2016. The THC requested that backhoe
scraping be conducted along the north boundary in order to achieve compliance with
ACT guidelines. The Lake Operations Facility will be located adjacent to the proposed
Bois d’Arc Lake Reservoir, a project that is being assessed and coordinated separately
from these facilities. In their comment on the Lake Facilities Project’s initial draft report
submittal (letter, Rebecca Shelton to Mindy Bonine, 9/3/2019, attached here), the THC
recommended conducting mechanical scraping within 5 meters of the Lake Operations
Center’s impact footprint adjacent to the cemetery’s mapped boundary or establishing
a 150-foot avoidance buffer around the cemetery’s mapped boundary. NTMWD elected
to conduct scraping to identify the potential for unmarked burials within their current
project limits. Four Gradall scrapes, conducted on September 10th and 11th, 2019 to the
north and south of the mapped cemetery boundary, were devoid of features or any other
indications of unmarked burials, suggesting that proposed construction is not likely to
impact marked or unmarked human burials associated with the Cross Cemetery (Figures
1 and 2).

Field Methodology
Gradall scraping was conducted with the specific intent of identifying the potential that
portions of the historic-age Cross Cemetery could extend beyond it’s mapped boundary.
Of particular interest for the project’s Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) compliance was
determining if unmarked burials could be located within the Lake Operations Facility’s
proposed footprint immediately north of the mapped cemetery boundary. Though no
plans are proposed at this time, NTMWD requested that the area south of the cemetery’s

mapped southern boundary was also subject to scraping to maximize efficiency by
providing additional information that may assist in expansion planning and constraints
identification, should such plans be developed in the future. Though such artifacts and/
or features may have been exposed during excavations, the survey was not intended to
assess the presence and/or significance of non-cemetery-related deposits.

AmaTerra staff monitored a standard rubber-tire Gradall during the fieldwork (Figure 3).
The Gradall used a roughly 1.5-meter wide, flat-bladed bucket that would excavate long,
level scrapes in an east/west direction, parallel to the northern and southern boundaries.
Because the mapped cemetery boundary is not fenced, AmaTerra archeologists based
their excavations off GPS data from the recorded cemetery boundary depicted on the
THC’s Sites Atlas. Two trenches were excavated approximately five and seven meters from
the northern boundary (GT 1N and 2N) while two others were dug south of the southern
boundary (GT 1S and 2S). Trenches were 20-50 meters long, divided into roughly fivemeter bucket reach segments. In each segment, the Gradall would dig progressive shallow
scrapes through the upper soil horizons with archeologists closely observing the exposed
scrape floor and walls for soil discolorations, pockets of wood, metal, or bone, or any
other indication of a possible human burial. This process would continue until a given
scrape segment uniformly-exposed sterile subsoil (Figure 4). That layer was then closely
inspected for evidence of burial shafts then the crew would move down to start the next
segment.
Throughout excavation, archeologists recorded observations on standardized forms
and notes and took representative photographs. At least 20 cm of the basal soils were
removed throughout the entire trench to ensure no features or unmarked grave shafts
were present. Once the absence of features was established and uniformity of undisturbed
soils along all trench walls had been recorded, the trench was backfilled completely. Some
vegetation clearing was conducted as necessary, but in some instances the trench was
shifted to minimize impacts. In addition, marked buried utilities were avoided. Those
areas are depicted on the attached Figures 1 and 2.
Maura Hogan (Field Director) and Alexis Goodwill (Archeological Technician) were
present at all times.
Results of Field Investigations

Scraping North of Cross Cemetery - Within Proposed Lake Operations Center
GT 1N and GT 2N were excavated from east to west, running parallel with the northern
boundary of the cemetery (Figures 1 and 2). The topography is best described as upland
plains, in a densely wooded environment with vegetation consisting of an overstory of
American Elm, white oak and Osage orange with an understory of green briar, poison ivy
and scrub oak. Upon arrival to the cemetery location, field staff noted a newly-flagged
telecommunications line along the eastern edge of the designated mechanical testing
area, and wooden stakes were planted around a new pipeline valve and associated utility
line roughly 10 m north of the polygon boundary. In order to avoid this underground
utility, it was decided that mechanical scraping needed to be conducted at least 3 m south

of the stakes, placing the northern trenches inside of the tree-line. While no utilities have
been installed within the fencing surrounding the cemetery plots, their presence was
slightly limiting to the eastern extension of the trenches, and dense vegetation needed to
be cleared ahead of excavation in order to avoid the pipeline to the adjacent north.

GT 1N was placed seven meters to the north of the mapped boundary line and GT 2N
was placed approximately two meters south of the first trench, approximately five meters
north of the mapped boundary. GT 1N was 49 m long, 223 cm wide (max) and 117 cm
deep (max); GT 2N was 51 m long, 203 cm wide (max) and 88 cm deep (max; Table 1).
Both trenches exhibited intact soil profiles throughout, with sterile, B-horizon soils (basal
clay) beginning around 60 cm deep in GT 2N and in all but the easternmost 5 meters of GT
1N. The eastern end of GT 1N extends beyond the tree line and terminates at the edge of
an open, fallow field. The northern wall profile of GT 1N shows an increase in the depth
of Zone 2 starting 5 meters west of the eastern trench terminus (Zone 2 extends from
roughly 30 cm to 60 cm below ground surface for the majority of the trench, but at the
east end dips to a depth of 92 cm), suggesting the presence of an old plow zone below the
open, fallow field (Figure 5). GT 1N was excavated to a depth of 117 cm at the eastern
end, nearly 30 cm deep into the basal clay, in order to confirm the absence of mottling
below or above transition to basal clays here. The increase in Zone 2 soil depth is not
accompanied by any mottling with either Zone 1 soils above nor with Zone 3 soils below
it, and soil integrity is preserved within each stratum throughout the profile. Both GT 1N
and GT 2N were devoid of cultural material and no subsurface features were observed
(see Figure 5, Figure 6).

Scraping South of Cross Cemetery – Constraints Identification for Potential Future
Projects
Trench GT 1S was placed five meters to the south of the polygon boundary line and Trench
2S was placed approximately two meters south of the first trench (approximately seven
meters south of the cemetery’s mapped southern boundary; Figures 1-2, Figure 7; Table
1). In consultation with NTMWD’s design consultants, Freese and Nichols, Inc., it was
determined that the second, farther trench on the south side of the cemetery (GT 2S)
was not required to extend the entire length of the cemetery boundary, and therefore
the trench extentends roughly two-thirds the length of GT 1S. A recently-installed
telecommunications line was flagged along
the eastern edge of the mechanical testing
area, therefore the trenches could not be
extended to match the entire length of the
polygon boundary (both trenches terminate
approximately 15 meters west of the eastern
polygon boundary). GT 1S was 33 m long,
175 cm wide and 87 cm deep; GT 2S was
21 m long, 176 cm wide and 82 cm deep.
Both trenches exhibited almost identical,
intact soil profiles throughout, with sterile,
B-horizon soils (basal clay) beginning around
60 cm deep in both trenches (see Figure 4,
Figure 8). No subsurface features or soil
disturbances were observed.
Trenches
were devoid of cultural material, with the
exception of one plastic water bottle and one
piece of construction tarp present near the

Cross Cemetery boundary.
Conclusions and Regulatory Recommendations

AmaTerra archeologists monitored four Gradall trenches that strongly suggest that
unmarked human burials are not likely to extend beyond the Cross Cemetery’s northern
or southern mapped boundaries. Each trench afforded archeologists with a long, broad,
contiguous soil exposure that showed no subsurface staining, artifact accumulations or
any other indications of burials (or any other cultural resource for that matter), though
none were observed. Reviewing an aerial photograph of the area from 1955 (Figure 2),
the mapped cemetery boundary matches the unmanaged wooded area immediately
south of actively-cultivated agricultural fields. This suggests that the mapped boundary is
long-established. Trenches 1N and 2N, dug within the proposed Lake Operations Center,
located north of the cemetery’s mapped boundary indicate that NTMWD is not likely to
impact Cross Cemetery as long as construction does not extend south of Trench 2N’s

southern edge. The Principal Investigator recommends that construction should proceed
with no significant archeological impacts anticipated and no further archeological
resource regulatory coordination required. In the unlikely event that significant
archeological deposits (including human burials) are exposed during construction, all
work in the immediate vicinity will cease until such time as the find(s) can be thoroughly
assessed and coordinated through your office. Though no such work is planned at this
time, archeological data from Trenches 1S and 2S indicate that any future expansion
will not likely impact Cross Cemetery as long as that work stays south of the northern
edge of Trench 1S. Because no project is planned at this time, no formal regulatory
recommendations are provided, though the findings from this report may be referenced
for coordination purposes should future expansions be planned to the south. No scraping
was conducted to the cemetery’s west. Any future project plans must be coordinated with
the THC prior to initiating construction.
