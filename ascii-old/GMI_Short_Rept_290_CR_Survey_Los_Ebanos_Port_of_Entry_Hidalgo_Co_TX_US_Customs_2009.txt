ABSTRACT

On June 15–16, 2009, Geo-Marine, Inc., conducted an intensive archaeological survey of 2.9
hectares (7 acres) associated with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) planned
modernization of Los Ebanos Land Port of Entry (LPOE), Hidalgo County, Texas, on the
U.S./Mexico international border. This work was completed under contract with Parsons on
behalf of CBP. Two previously identified archaeological sites are located within 1.6 kilometers
(1 mile) of the Los Ebanos area of potential effects but will not be affected by the proposed
construction. One new archaeological site (41HG235), a rectangular brick structure interpreted as
a livestock watering trough, was documented during the survey, which consisted of 22 shovel
tests and six backhoe trenches. In addition, two shallow subsurface charcoal deposits were
documented, one unaccompanied by other materials and the second associated with modern
debris. No other cultural materials were discovered. Geo-Marine does not recommend further
archaeological work at Los Ebanos LPOE, and recommends that construction related to the
modernization of the LPOE proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) proposes the modernization of land ports of entry
(LPOE) along the northern and southern borders of the United States, mandated under the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act). On June 15–16, 2009, Geo-Marine,
Inc. (Geo-Marine), conducted an intensive archaeological survey of 7 acres associated with the
planned construction to modernize Los Ebanos LPOE, Hidalgo County, Texas, on the
U.S./Mexico international border (Geo-Marine project number 30217.04.01.01). This work was
completed under Contract Number HSBP1107D01730 with Parsons, on behalf of CBP. The
objective of this archaeological survey—and a simultaneous architectural survey presented
separately—was to fulfill regulatory requirements including, but not limited to, Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 and its implementing regulations, 36 CFR
Part 800.
Los Ebanos LPOE is located on County Road 41, immediately southwest of the village of Los
Ebanos in Hidalgo County, Texas. Across the border from Los Ebanos LPOE and 2.4 kilometers
(km; 1.5 miles [mi]) to the west is Ciudad Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, Tamaulipas, Mexico. Figure 1
shows the location of the area of potential effects (APE) as defined by planned construction
activities on the Los Ebanos 7.5 minute series USGS topographic quadrangle. The APE for the
archaeological field survey consists of the existing 0.6- hectare (ha; 1.4-acre [ac]) LPOE property
and the proposed 2.3-ha (5.6-ac) acquisition area, encompassing a total of 2.9 ha (7 ac).

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The Los Ebanos APE is located along the Rio Grande in southern Hidalgo County, where the
river forms the southern border between the United States and Mexico. According to Blair
(1950), the classic source on environmental zones in Texas, the Los Ebanos LPOE APE is located
in the southern part of the Tamaulipan biotic province. Blair (1950) notes that this large region,
which covers the area south of a line from Del Rio to San Antonio and portions of northern
Mexico, is not homogenous and places the extreme southern part into the Matamoran District.
This district includes a riparian zone that parallels the river and is more heavily vegetated than the
other areas of the district (Mallouf et al. 1977). In modern times, however, agricultural fields
have been cleared up to or near the river edge, greatly reducing this riparian zone (Cooper et al.
2003).

Updated environmental classifications such as the U.S. Environmental Protection

Agency’s (EPA) Level IV Ecoregions (Griffith et al. 2004) take account of these complexities
and also integrate the Los Ebanos physiographic location near the “break point” between the
higher-slope incision regime of the upper Rio Grande and the lower-slope depositional regime of
the river delta (see also Gustavson and Collins 1998). In the EPA system, Los Ebanos lies at the
intersection between subregions 31d, the Rio Grande Floodplain and Terraces portion of the
Southern Texas Plains Ecoregion, and 34f, the Lower Rio Grande Alluvial Floodplain subregion
of the Western Gulf Coastal Plain Ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2004).
As expected given the active floodplain setting, soils in the APE tend to be extremely deep, welldrained, fine (clayey to silty), and relatively recent. Soils within the APE include Matamoros
silty clay, Reynosa silty clay loam, and Rio Grande silt loam, with examples of Camargo silt
loam and Rio Grande silty clay loam occurring immediately outside the APE; all of these soils
4

have formed in calcareous Quaternary alluvial deposits on level bottomlands and low terraces
(Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2009).
According to data from the climate monitoring station maintained by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Southern Regional Climate Center (SRCC) at Rio
Grande City, the closest long-term station to the project area, 30-year temperature normals range
from a minimum of 44 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) in January to 99°F in July and August (SRCC
2009). The area is classified as semiarid to subhumid, with less than 2.5 centimeters (cm; 1 inch
[in]) of precipitation per month from November through March and a high of 12 cm (4.7 in) in
September (SRCC 2009).
Boyd et al. (1994) estimate that 98 percent of the U.S. side of the lower Rio Grande floodplain
has been cleared. Human activities, including deliberate management practices, have drastically
modified the flora and fauna during historic and modern times. The largest contributors to recent
modifications are clearing, planting, landscape modifications for irrigation systems and
agricultural fields, overgrazing of rangeland, and the suppression of grass fires, now thought to be
crucial to control the spread of flammable brush (Black 1989a; Boyd et al. 1994; Kibler and
Freeman 1993). The discovery and subsequent development of oil and gas fields has also caused
significant impacts (Garza 2008). Modern vegetation is dominated by thorny brush such as
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and various types of acacia, with more heavily wooded areas
supporting larger trees such as sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata), Berlandier ash (Fraxinus
berlandieriana), western soapberry (Sapindus drummondii), anacua (Ehretia anacua), great leadtree (Leucaena pulverulenta), Texas ebony (Pithecellobium flexicaule), and various shrubs and
vines (Bousman et al. 1990).
The Los Ebanos area is nominally home to at least 61 species of mammals, numerous snakes and
lizards, and two varieties of land turtles (Blair 1950). However, historic and modern ranching
and agricultural activities as well as urban and industrial development have profoundly affected
the fauna of the lower Rio Grande. By the latter 1800s or early 1900s, once-abundant wildlife
such as bison, pronghorn antelope, bear, and wolf had all been eliminated (Black 1989a). The
only large native herbivore presently found along the Rio Grande today is the white-tailed deer,
which is quite rare (Cooper et al. 2003).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

REGIONAL BACKGROUND

Cultural Chronology
Archaeological investigations in the lower Rio Grande valley of South Texas have been limited in
scope and few in number compared to most other areas of the Southwest. The majority of the
archaeological sites within the lower Rio Grande valley of South Texas consist of assemblages
with few temporally diagnostic materials. In general, the South Texas Plains constitute one of the
least known areas of the state (Black 1989b:39). Still, the prehistoric cultural sequence for South
Texas can be separated into three temporal categories: Paleo-Indian, Archaic (divided into Early,
Middle, and Late subperiods), and Late Prehistoric (Table 1). The dates for this chronology are
based on a comprehensive study of the region conducted by Black (1989b).

Paleo-Indian Period
Based on limited paleoenvironmental data and lithic assemblages, the Paleo-Indian period (ca.
9500–6000 B.C.) is typically characterized as the period when small nomadic groups hunted nowextinct Late Pleistocene megafauna. Though few regional data exist relevant to this period,
Paleo-Indian lifeways probably included a much greater use of both plants and animals than the
current understanding and artifact assemblages indicate. There are few data to contribute to an
understanding of how Paleo-Indian peoples used the landscape in the lower Rio Grande valley.

However, at this time, it is assumed that the Rio Grande, as a large regional drainage with
associated estuarine and coastal resources, was as important to Paleo-Indian people as it was to
later Native American groups.

Paleoenvironmental data for neighboring regions, such as

southcentral Texas, have indicated that temperatures during this time period were generally
cooler and the climate more humid (Bousman et al. 1990). Extinct species such as mastodon,
mammoth, large tortoise, and long-nosed peccary as well as species such as bison that no longer
inhabit the area were probably utilized by Paleo-Indian people (Black 1989a; Bousman et al.
1990).
There are very few Paleo-Indian sites in the lower Rio Grande area. This gap in the record most
likely reflects the rapid deposition of sediments during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene
rather than the character of Paleo-Indian occupation itself. The best-known Paleo-Indian site in
the lower Rio Grande valley is Perdida, located approximately 11 km (7 mi) north of Rio Grande
City along Arroyo Los Olmos (Weir 1956). The site’s surface assemblage contained several
projectile point types, including six Plainview, one Meserve, four Angostura, three Scottsbluff,
and one Clovis.

Because 289 projectile points were documented on the site from several

temporal periods (Tortugas and Lerma points were the most common) and subsurface
investigations were not conducted, the site was not given a formal Paleo-Indian designation until
a later examination was conducted by Newton (1968).

7

Archaic Period
The Early Archaic period (6000–2500 B.C.) is characterized by a gradual shift from a nomadic
hunting and gathering lifeway to a less mobile subsistence strategy. A reduction in large game
species caused by depredation and/or environmental factors may have promoted use of a greater
diversity of plant and animal resources.

The reasons for the transition from Paleo-Indian

lanceolate points to the Early Archaic stemmed dart point is not yet understood, but this
technology change appears to mark the end of the Paleo-Indian period. As with the Paleo-Indian
period, few Early Archaic data exist for the lower Rio Grande valley. Extrapolations from inland
and coastal areas some 161 km (100 mi) north of the project area indicate that groups during this
time remained small in size and moved across wide expanses of landscape (McKinney 1981).
The earliest example of subsistence data from an Early Archaic site in South Texas is from site
41LK31/32, which dates to ca. 3400 B.C. (Black 1989b). Remains from this site include freshwater mussels, land snails, turtle bones, and fresh-water drum bones (Scott and Fox 1982). The
earliest known shell midden in South Texas is the McKenzie site (Ricklis 1986). Both of these
sites are located along the Nueces River, near Corpus Christi, approximately 241 km (150 mi) to
the north.

Middle Archaic (2500–400 B.C.) occupations are poorly defined within the lower Rio Grande
valley, because they usually tend to include triangular projectile point types also utilized within
the subsequent Late Archaic. In general, for South Texas as a whole, the Middle Archaic period
represents a shift from large-game hunting to a greater reliance on plant resources, based on the
presence of dated burned rock middens that might be related to those found in Central Texas
(Hall et al. 1986). In addition to various projectile point types, the Middle Archaic archaeological
record includes incised bone, tubular stone pipes, conch columella gouges, and conch adzes
(Black 1989b).
Late Archaic period sites (400 B.C.–A.D. 800), including cemeteries, are more common within the
lower Rio Grande valley than are sites from the preceding periods and are often observed in
association with Late Prehistoric period assemblages.

This association may reflect a long

projectile point tradition being carried into the ceramic period or a reuse of site locations.
Corner- or side-notched projectile points, as well as smaller triangular styles, typify those found
in Late Archaic assemblages. Beveled tools are common, and corner-tanged bifaces, although
8

found, are more rare (Black 1989b). Because of the greater abundance of Late Archaic sites,
additional subsistence data are present. Sites along coastal areas contain a wide variety of fish,
shellfish, and small mammals, suggesting a greater emphasis on collection rather than hunting
and gathering. Farther inland, closer to the project area, a variety of plant species was utilized, in
addition to small mammals (rabbits, rodents, etc.). The presence of coastal materials such as shell
pendants in inland contexts suggests trade relationships between coastal and inland groups (Hall
1981). Population densities were higher during this period than before and may have been a
continuation of population growth during the Middle Archaic (Black 1989b).

Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800–1519/1600) is probably the best understood of the
prehistoric sequence because the remains are more numerous and better preserved than those of
previous periods. Radiocarbon dates from this period are relatively more common, allowing for
more precise temporal control.

In addition, the few ceramics that exist have aided in

understanding the Late Prehistoric period in South Texas.

One of the best-known Late

Prehistoric cultural phenomena in the region is the Brownsville complex, which began
approximately 800 years ago in the Rio Grande delta area, with roots likely in the Tamaulipas
region of Mexico (MacNeish 1947). The Brownsville complex is characterized by shell tools and
ornaments, conical pumice pipes, and triangular arrow points.

Although ceramics are not

common in the Rio Grande delta, a small amount of Rockport and Huastecan pottery has been
found in Brownsville-complex burials (Black 1989b). A variety of marine and terrestrial species
such as shellfish, drum, spotted sea trout, bison, deer, and rabbit were exploited.
Several Late Prehistoric period cemetery sites have been documented in the lower Rio Grande
valley area. Two of the larger, better-studied sites are the Floyd Morris site (41CF2; Collins et al.
1969) and the Ayala site (41HG1; Campbell and Frizzell 1949; Hester and Rodgers 1971; Hester
and Ruecking 1969). These sites are discrete cemeteries and appear not to be associated with
habitation areas. Many of the graves contain quantities of funerary items, and the human remains
are usually discovered in bundled or flexed positions. Cremated remains and skeletons covered
in red ochre have also been located (Campbell and Frizzell 1949; Hester 1969). The formal

9

cemetery sites, the established shell industry, and the presence of ceramics strongly suggest a
semisedentary settlement and subsistence regime during the Late Prehistoric period.

Historic Period
With the European arrival in the area in 1519, traded and discarded European goods became
available to aboriginal groups. As Native American craftsmen augmented previous technologies
with new ones such as the pottery wheel, European and European-influenced artifacts appeared in
increasing numbers at native sites. Despite this influence, European settlement along the Rio
Grande did not truly begin until the latter half of the seventeenth century (Sánchez 1994). In
1750, José Vasquez Borrego became the first Spaniard to establish a settlement on the north side
of the river. This settlement, known as Nuestra Señora de los Dolores, was located upriver from
the project area in Zapata County. It began as a ranch and continued as a small community until
1815, when continuous Indian attacks forced its abandonment. Similar sites were established
along the river throughout the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, as the Spanish
government granted porciónes, long, thin tracts that ran perpendicular to the river and thereby
allowed equitable access to water, to prominent figures who wanted to enlarge available grazing
lands. The ranches along the Rio Grande, in addition those located near San Antonio, represent
the roots of the American cattle industry and the cowboy culture that is now indelibly associated
with Texas (Cooper et al. 2003).

Several major conflicts with Mexico had profound effects on the lower Rio Grande. For instance,
after Sam Houston’s decisive 1836 victory over Mexican forces at San Jacinto and the creation of
the Republic of Texas, Mexico refused to relinquish its claim on lands in the Rio Grande valley,
continuing to maintain garrisons in small river villages. Soon, unhappy Mexican citizens began
to demand greater self-determination. Conflicts between Mexican troops and Mexican citizens
began to erupt.

Because many Mexicans owned property on both sides of the river these

engagements took place on both sides as well. Much of this conflict took place in the lower
reaches of the Rio Grande, where men such as Antonio Canales and Antonio Zapata (after whom
nearby Zapata County is named) led the revolt. In 1840, Canales called for a convention to meet
and form the Republic of the Rio Grande, with its capital at Laredo. However, forces from the
Mexican central government soon entered Laredo and the revolution was put down (Sánchez
10

1994). Between 1842 and 1844, a second Texas-Mexican war—driven largely by the Mexican
government’s refusal to recognize the Republic of Texas—took place upriver from the project
area. Skirmishes occurred as Mexican soldiers crossed the Rio Grande and continued until
Mexican forces at the Battle of Mier soundly defeated a rag-tag company of Texas soldiers. In
1844, however, a peace treaty was signed between the governments of Mexico and the Republic
of Texas. Nonetheless, cross-border conflicts continued sporadically for several years, with the
Rio Grande area as the main point of contention, until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was
signed in 1848.
In the 1860s, military conflict again disrupted life in the lower Rio Grande valley. The citizens of
the valley generally agreed with the 1861 vote of the Texas Secession Convention in Austin to
secede from the United States. The issue of slavery was not considered important since “in the
border counties from Laredo to the gulf, only fourteen slaves were listed in the 1860 census”
(Sánchez 1994:55). Pro-secession sentiment in the valley was more a matter of the strong ties
many prominent families in the region had to Austin, whose citizens were very pro-secession.
After the Secession Convention, many encounters between the Confederate and Union forces
occurred in the area. Fighting continued even after Robert E. Lee surrendered to Gen. Ulysses S.
Grant at Appomattox, Virginia, in 1865; indeed, the last land battle of the Civil War was fought
in the lower Rio Grande valley, at Palmito Hill in Cameron County, more than a month after the
official surrender (Cooper et al. 2003).

Two significant, interrelated changes occurred at the end of the nineteenth century and early part
of the twentieth century, laying the foundations for modern cultural and economic life in the
lower Rio Grande valley. The first came with the railroad, which arrived in 1865 when Gen. P.
H. Sheridan had the first rail lines laid to help move Union troops and supplies. A sharp increase
in railroad construction took place in the 1870s and 1880s, and by early 1900, the area was
crisscrossed by a network of railroads (Cooper et al. 2003).
In the early twentieth century, as the potential for agriculture in the lower Rio Grande valley
became apparent, several irrigation districts were established. The San Benito Land and Water
Company and the American Rio Grande Land and Irrigation Company are only two of these.
Developers such as Benjamin Franklin Yoakum assembled groups of investors and implemented
comprehensive plans that integrated the construction of irrigation systems, the sale of land,
11

coordination with railroad authorities, and town planning. Some of the irrigation districts and
associated companies established during this time are still in existence today (Cooper et al. 2003).

Los Ebanos in Historic Context
The Rio Grande crossing in the vicinity of Los Ebanos dates at least to the 1740s and has been in
constant use since that time. The site is noted for its use as a crossing on the Salt Trail and during
the Mexican-American War, the Texas Rangers era, and the Prohibition era. The channel of the
Rio Grande has changed significantly over the years, creating a complex series of meander belts
and remnant features (see Frederick et al. 2009; Gustavson and Collins 1998); therefore, the
location of the crossing has never been static. Despite the construction of multiple bridges across
the Rio Grande beginning in the early 1900s, boats of some kind have always been used at the
Los Ebanos crossing. The current hand-drawn ferry operation opened for business in its present
location on December 22, 1950 (Figure 2).

The village of Los Ebanos became a permanent settlement during the Mexican-American War
(1846–1848). Its population fluctuated throughout the nineteenth century due to the changing
international boundary and widespread criminal activity in the vicinity of the crossing; a Texas
Historical Commission (THC) subject marker on the LPOE site tells of Mexican troops, Texas
Rangers, rustlers, and smugglers. Village population in the twentieth century ranged between 200
and 400 residents. The village of Los Ebanos has been determined eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as has the ferry crossing. Historic-age resources in
the project area are discussed further in the architectural counterpart to the present document, and
a comprehensive historic context is available in Belfast et al. (2008).

PREVIOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE APE
Only one previous archaeological project has been carried out within Los Ebanos LPOE. The
footprint of the existing LPOE, a 1.4-acre area enclosed within the present 7-acre APE, was tested
in 2006 by investigators from Michael Baker Corporation (Mathews and Mooney 2006). No sites
were identified during the Michael Baker survey, although several mid-twentieth-century features
were documented and five of the study’s seven shovel tests contained prehistoric cultural
materials. Mathews and Mooney concluded that these materials may be intrusive, however,
brought in with gravel from a nearby quarry site known to contain prehistoric artifacts. Overall,
Mathews and Mooney (2006) described the top 50–100 cm (20–39 in) of deposits in the existing
LPOE as extensively disturbed by a combination of river meandering, historic and modern
agriculture, and CBP operations. They recommended backhoe trenching for any proposed work
that might affect deeper deposits.
There are no previously documented archaeological sites within the APE, but there are two—
41HG207 and 41HG218—within 1.6 km (1 mi) (THC Texas Archeological Sites Atlas) (Table 2;
see Figure 1). Site 41HG207 was defined in 2007 based on prehistoric lithic artifacts and historic
ceramics, glass, and rifle cartridges collected in a backhoe cut; the site was recommended not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Site 41HG218 was defined in 2008 based on the discovery of
a Middle Archaic projectile point and lithic flakes in a shovel test, and was evaluated and
recommended eligible for NRHP inclusion. The Environmental Stewardship Plan of the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security (U.S. Department of Homeland Security 2008) considered the

CHAPTER 4
METHODS

This archaeological survey of the Los Ebanos LPOE APE was proposed with the objective of
identifying and documenting the presence of archaeological materials that may be affected by
proposed future construction activities.

SURVEY METHODS
The archaeological survey consisted of pedestrian reconnaissance and the excavation of
subsurface testing units, both backhoe trenches and shovel tests. Placement of the units was
guided by the work plan submitted to Parsons, CBP, and the THC, with modifications based on
field conditions observed during the initial on-site reconnaissance. Although archaeologists
carried a Trimble® GeoXT™ global positioning system (GPS) unit to record the locations of all
excavation units, tree cover consistently prevented the device from acquiring sufficient satellite
reception. Therefore, the locations of the subsurface testing units were paced from known
features or from GPS points taken in cleared areas with better reception. Dense vegetation
proved to be the only difficulty in carrying out the proposed survey. However, all areas of the
APE were surveyed for archaeological materials.

15

Shovel Tests
Each shovel test was excavated in 20-cm (8-in) levels to subsoil or to 80 cm (32 in) in depth,
whichever was encountered first, with all excavated matrix screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-in)
hardware cloth. Soil and sediment characteristics were described using standard texture and
Munsell color nomenclature. All observations were recorded on standard Geo-Marine field
forms. Each shovel test unit was backfilled following the documentation of the deposits.

Backhoe Trenches
Each backhoe trench consisted of a deep central cut flanked by safety benches per U.S.
Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA 1995)
requirements, as described in the approved work plan. The trenching progressed in 50-cm-depth
(20-in) increments, and trenches were approximately 2.5 to 3 m (8 to 10 ft) in length and 1 m (3
ft) in width. The depth goal for the deep testing was 2–2.5 m (7–8 ft), although the actual depth
reached in each trench was based on pedogenic and depositional horizons observed, the presence
or absence of cultural materials, the local water table, and safety concerns related to soil stability,
as evaluated by the criteria discussed in the safety plan submitted separately to Parsons.
Following completion of the mechanical excavations, the geoarchaeological specialist, Dr. Chris
Dayton, cleaned the end wall of the trench with a knife and trowel, and then examined the
exposed deposits. The deposits were described in general accordance with Schoeneberger et al.
(2002). The approximate age of the deposits examined in the field was inferred on the basis of
the degree of soil development in accordance with general principles outlined by Birkeland
(1999).

Following description and sketching of the deposits, each trench was completely

backfilled and restored to its original condition.

DEFINING SITES AND LOCALITIES
A site is defined on the basis of content and extent. When a shovel test yields cultural material,
additional shovel tests are excavated in a cruciform pattern at 5-m (16-ft) intervals around the
initial test until two sterile shovel tests are encountered in each cardinal direction. A site is then
defined within the extent of positive shovel tests. For surficial materials, a site is defined as five
16

or more cultural items of at least two different artifact materials or classes (e.g., prehistoric stone
tool manufacturing debris exhibiting different raw materials, or manufacturing debris in
combination with stone tools; or several different historic-era ceramic [or glass] types, or
ceramics in addition to glass) within a 20-m (66-ft) square. Cultural remains meeting these
criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted
to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin. Conversely, the discovery of
one or two cultural items (either surface or subsurface) not meeting these criteria is considered an
isolated occurrence of human activity and is simply documented by location and content as a
“locality”; likewise, historic-era material representing an obvious single-event trash dump is not
considered a site, and only location and content are documented.

ARTIFACT PROCESSING AND CURATION
The approved archaeological work plan submitted to THC and Parsons included protocols for
artifact processing and curation. These protocols included the collection, bagging, and delivery
of all recovered artifacts to the Geo-Marine laboratory in Plano, Texas, for processing and
analysis; the washing, weighing, counting, cataloging, and labeling of all artifacts in compliance
with University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) standards; the entry of preliminary context and
attribute data for all materials into a Microsoft ACCESS database on an IBM network system;
and the submittal of all artifacts to UTSA at the completion of fieldwork. No artifacts were
collected during the survey, rendering the artifact processing protocols moot. However, all
original field documentation, maps, photographs, and other data generated from this project will
be submitted to TARL for curation at the conclusion of the project.

CHAPTER 5
SURVEY RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY FINDINGS
Twenty-two shovel tests and six backhoe trenches were excavated in the APE, six more shovel
tests and two less backhoe trenches than proposed in the approved work plan (Figure 3; Tables 3
and 4). In the northern half of the APE, subsurface test units Shovel Test (ST)1–ST10 and
Backhoe Trench (BHT)1–BHT4 were placed at the locations proposed in the work plan. In the
southern half of the APE, ST11–ST22 were placed in the proposed locations, but the placement
of backhoe trenches diverged from the work plan due to landowner objections. Vegetation in the
APE south of the existing LPOE proved to be extremely dense (Figure 4), and to allow the
passage of heavy equipment without damaging hydraulic lines would have required the clearing
of a path approximately 2–3 m (7–10 ft) wide. The landowner, Ms. Rivas, voiced her concerns
about such clearing activities to Geo-Marine field personnel, who consulted with Geo-Marine and
Parsons management. Per these consultations, BHT5 and BHT6 were placed along the northern
edge of the wooded section of the southern parcel but not inside it. Additional shovel tests were
excavated within the southern parcel to compensate, with at least one (ST20) excavated below the
typical 80-cm-depth (32-in) threshold.
None of the shovel tests yielded historic or prehistoric cultural materials (see Table 1). Several
contained modern trash such as beer cans down to 50 cm (20 in) in depth. Deep ST20 mentioned
above was placed in a relatively undisturbed area near the southern edge of the APE and reached
95 cm (37 in) before extreme compaction of the alluvial silt forced termination.

None of the backhoe trenches yielded historic or prehistoric cultural materials (see Table 4). Two
of the six backhoe trenches—BHT1 and BHT5—contained charcoal deposits at approximately
40–70 cm below surface (cmbs) (16–28 inches below surface [inbs]). The deposit in BHT1
(excavated in the northeast corner of the APE) consisted of small flecks of charcoal mixed in with
the alluvial silt. No other materials were found in association with the flecks. In BHT5, placed in
the gravel parking lot east of the current LPOE, loose charcoal was found immediately below the
parking surface in the unit’s northern safety bench (Figure 5).

Shovel tests could not be

excavated in this area due to the extreme hardness of the parking surface, so the upper 40 cm (16
in) were mechanically removed, revealing that the charcoal was associated with fiberglass mesh,
soft plastic lubricant bottles, and other modern materials.

One archaeological resource, 41HG235, was identified during the pedestrian reconnaissance
preceding subsurface tests. Located in the northeast corner of the southern wooded land parcel
and east of the current LPOE, 41HG235 consisted of a rectangular 1.2-x-0.8-m (3.9-x-2.6-ft)
structure of four courses of mortared machine-made bricks, probably a watering trough for small
livestock (Figure 6). Set into the ground adjacent to the brick feature was an upright isolated
railroad tie with iron hinges that most likely functioned as a gatepost (Figure 7). No foundations
or any other sign of a larger structure could be found. Four shovel tests were placed in a radial
pattern around the brick structure, at 5-m (16-ft) intervals in each cardinal direction, but none
yielded cultural materials. Additional radial shovel tests could not be placed due to the proximity
of the locality to a parking lot to the north, a stream-gauge access road to the east, and extensive
deposits of modern trash to the west and south. The 1965 USGS topographic map used as a base
in the documents provided by Parsons shows a square outline in the area of 41HG235 (Figure 8).
This symbol is often used to indicate minor nonresidential structures such as corrals, indirectly
supporting the interpretation of the brick rectangle as a watering trough. Given the extensive
disturbance of the area and the lack of associated material other than modern trash, it was felt that
the brick structure and post did not merit designation as a site. No further work is recommended
at 41HG235.

disturbed ground.

RECOMMENDATIONS
On June 15–16, 2009, Geo-Marine archaeologists conducted an intensive archaeological survey
of 7 acres associated with the planned modernization of Los Ebanos LPOE. One archaeological
site (41HG235), a small brick structure that may represent a watering trough, was documented
during the survey. Based on the lack of associated materials and physical evidence of a larger
structure, as well as the high level of disturbance in the area as a whole, no additional work at the
site is recommended.

Charcoal was found in near-surface contexts in two of the backhoe

trenches, one (BHT1) without associated materials, and one (BHT5) associated with modern
materials such as fiberglass mesh. None of the other subsurface test units (22 shovel tests and
four other backhoe trenches) yielded cultural material other than modern trash. No cultural
materials were collected during this survey. Therefore, based upon these findings, Geo-Marine
recommends that construction for Los Ebanos LPOE proceed as planned.
