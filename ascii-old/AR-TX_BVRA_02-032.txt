ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the site of the proposed 10 acre Richland Creek
Wildlife Management Area office/shop/check station site in Freestone County, Texas was
conducted by Brazos Valley Research Associates on May 23, 1994. This project was
conducted for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. This investigation was
performed using the pedestrian survey method supported by shovel testing.
A previously recorded locality (L-242) containing a single dart point had been
identified within the boundaries of the current project area by the Archaeology Research
Program at Southern Methodist University (SMU) in 1980 during their survey of the
proposed Richland Creek Reservoir. The only formal documentation of this find is on a
locality card at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.
This project examined the entire 10 acre tract with emphasis on the area where L-242
was depicted on the Roustabout Camp topographic quadrangle.
Shovel testing and probing in conjunction with extensive surface examination of
exposed areas revealed only a few quartzite cobbles on the ground surface and two chert
flakes in shovel tests. The 10 acre tract was found to be very disturbed because of road
construction, campsite construction, and erosion. The paucity of subsurface cultural
materials (2 flakes) and general disturbed condition of the project area provide sufficient
evidence that the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department should be allowed to proceed
with their construction plans as planned. The data collected as a result of this
investigation have been added to the locality card in the TARL files and the area has not
been formally designated as an archaeological site. The two flakes were not collected for
curation.
Copies of the final report have been submitted to the Texas Historical Commission
for distribution and curation in their library and to the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department. The original manuscript, project notes, and all additional records for this
project are on file at the office of Brazos Valley Research Associates in Bryan, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) plans to construct two
buildings, an office/shop, and check station on a 10 acre tract in central Freestone
County, Texas (Figure 1). In a letter from Dale Prochaska of TPWD to Timothy K.
Perttula, Ph.D., Assistant Director of Antiquities Review, Texas Historical Commission,
dated May 5, 1994, the details of the proposed construction is described (Appendix I).
The project area is part of the Richland Creek Wildlife Management Area
(RCWMA) and is located on a hilltop 2.5 miles south of United States Highway 287 and
east of F.M. 488 on the South Unit of RCWMA. The project area is situated on an upland
ridge surrounded by several drainages: Richland Creek to the north, Tehuacana and
Cottonwood creeks to the south, Hillside Slough to the south, Hillside Slough to the east,
and Hogpen Slough and Little Sandy Creek to the west. The 10 acre site is depicted on
the Roustabout Camp 7.5' topographic quadrangle dated 1960 and photorevised 1982
(Figure 2). A map prepared by TPWD (Figure 3) depicts the project area and location of
the two proposed structures.
The Archaeology Research Program at SMU had performed a previous
examination of the proposed Richland Creek Reservoir, which includes the current
project area, in 1980 and a single dart point was found and recorded as prehistoric locality
(L-242). However, only a locality card was present at TARL and additional work at this
locality was considered necessary by the Texas Antiquities Committee before TPWD
could be cleared for construction. In order to comply with this requirement, TPWD
contracted with Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) of Bryan, Texas to evaluate
the proposed park site. The project number assigned by BVRA is 94-09. This project was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee permit 1408.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coast Plain section of the Gulf
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1946) and the Texan
biotic province as defined by Blair (1950:100-102). According to Blair, the term Texan
province has been used by Dice (1943) for the broad ecotone between the forests of the
Austroriparian and Carolinan provinces of eastern Texas and Oklahoma and the
grasslands of the western parts of these states.
Data taken from the Texas Almanac for 1984-1985 (Kingston and Harris 1983)
states that the county receives 38.53 inches of annual rainfall. When combined with a
January minimum temperature of 36 degrees Fahrenheit and a July maximum
temperature of 94 degrees Fahrenheit, a growing season of 263 days results.
No soils book was available for Freestone County at the time of this survey.
Topographically, the project area may be described as gently rolling to hilly with
elevations varying between 320 feet at the top of the upland ridge and 260 feet on the
lower slopes above the floodplain. Several small, probably intermittent, streams drain
these uplands to the south into Tehuacana Creek that eventually merges with the Trinity
River, the largest drainage in the area.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
General
Freestone County is located in the North Central Texas region as defined by
Biesaart et al. (1985:76) in a statistical overview of prehistoric sites in Texas published by
the Office of the State Archeologist, Texas Historical Commission. This is an area that
was well documented in terms of numbers of sites in 1985 when compared to other
regions of Texas. When the statistical overview was compiled, a total of 2678 prehistoric
sites (13.25% of the state) were recorded in the entire region with 179 sites in Freestone
County. Only the Central Texas region reported more sites or had a higher percentage
statewide. In terms of county statistics only three counties (Bell, Dallas, and Hill) had
more recorded sites in 1985. The 179 sites recorded in the county in 1985 consisted of
6.68% of the region and .89% of the state. The reader is referred to the overview for
additional statistical information concerning Freestone County and its relation to the rest
of Texas.
It was beyond the scope of this project to compute percentages of known sites in
the county according to temporal affiliation and other significant categories. However,
after reading the statistical overview it is evident that sites of all time periods are present
in the area. According to Biesaart et al. (1985:136), the following sites were represented
in 1985: Paleo-Indian (4), Early Archaic (6), Middle Archaic (9), Late Archaic (18),
General Archaic (28), and Late Prehistoric (51). Fifty-nine sites were listed as State
Archeological Landmarks.
According to the planning document prepared by the Department of Antiquities
Protection (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:6), Freestone County is located within the
Eastern Planning Region, specifically the Prairie-Savanna area of Texas. Perhaps the
most serious threat to the archaeological resources of Freestone County is the presence
of near-surface lignite deposits that are currently being mined by various commercial
ventures. According to Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993:19-20), threats to archeological
resources because of current mining activities, proposed strip mining, and the extent of
recoverable reserves are particularly acute in the area including Freestone County.
Previous Investigations
Work at the Jewett and Big Brown mines in Freestone and Leon counties where
lignite is extracted from the near surface Wilcox formation has provided a major source of
archaeological data for this area. The contract firms of Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc.
(Voellinger et al. 1980; Voellinger and Freeman 1980, Freeman and Voellinger 1982,
Voellinger et al. 1983) and Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Fields 1988, 1990; Fields et al.
1990, 1991) have conducted the majority of work at Jewett Mine. Work at the Big Brown
mine was performed by Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (Bond et al. 1982; Glander and
Moore 1989) and the Texas Archeological Survey (Wooldridge 1979; Pliska et al. 1980).

6

Another threat to the archaeological resources in the area is the construction of
reservoirs and water conveyance facilities. In Freestone County, construction of the
Richland/Chambers Reservoir provided the need for archaeological survey that was
conducted by the Archaeology Research Program at SMU. Preliminary reports were
published by SMU (1980, 1981) with the results appearing in reports by Raab and Moir
(1981), Raab (1982), and five technical volumes (Bruseth and Moir 1987 [Vol. I]; Bruseth
and Martin 1987 [Vol. II]; McGregor and Bruseth 1987 [Vol. III]; Moir and Jurney 1987
[Vol. IV]; and Jurney and Moir 1987 [Vol. V]). An evaluation of the cultural resources of
Chambers, Richland, and Tehuacana creeks was prepared by Burton and Conners
(1979) for the Trinity River Authority of Texas in anticipation of a reservoir site in the area.
Other reservoir construction in the area that has resulted in archaeological investigations
is the Tennessee Colony Lake (Richner and Lee 1976, 1977) project.
Additional work in Freestone County includes (in chronological order) an
archaeological and historical survey of the Turlington Field (Meade 1977), the Keechi
Area (Meade 1978), a survey along a proposed route of a buried cable in Fairfield State
Park (Corbin 1980), an assessment of the Limestone Electric Generating Station (Espey,
Huston & Associates, Inc. 1980; Day 1984; Wooldridge et al. 1982), a cultural resources
survey of a well site in Fairfield Lake State Recreation Area (Price 1983), and a survey of
two proposed sharecrop field areas in the Richland Creek Wildlife Management Area
(Corbin 1992). Oil and gas drilling has also resulted in cultural resource investigations at
the Fairfield Lake State Recreation Area (Skinner 1983) and the Gus Engling Wildlife
Management Area (Moore 1993).
Chronology
As stated above, there is evidence that Freestone County was inhabited during the
late Pleistocene and Early Holocene during what is commonly referred to as the
Paleo-Indian stage. A review of other reports for the area and the planning document
prepared by the Department of Antiquities Protection (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993)
indicates that it is probable that once man appeared in the region continuous occupation
and utilization of the area resulted through the historic period to the present. Following
the Archaic period, parts of Northeast Texas was settled and inhabited by a sedentary
group known generally as Caddo. Many of these Caddoan sites are regarded as highly
significant in terms of research potential. At least two sites in Freestone County (41FT5
and 41FT29) have been identified as Caddo and are believed to be significant or
potentially significant (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Appendix 2.5.1). The reader is
referred to this planning document and those reports mentioned above under Previous
Investigations for detailed discussions of the archaeological background of Freestone
County and vicinity. The planning document is especially recommended as it provides
detailed information for the entire region not available in other sources.

METHODS
The project was divided into three phases - background and archival research,
field investigation, and report preparation. The first phase consisted of a check of the site
records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). The Principal
Investigator performed this task.
The background and archival research consisted of a review of existing literature
on Freestone County at the TARL library and a check of the Abstracts in Texas Contract
Archeology project currently sponsored by the Department of Antiquities Protection,
Texas Historical Commission. Volumes in the abstracts series have been published for
1987 (Moore 1991), 1988 (Moore 1990), 1989 (Moore 1993), 1990 (Moore 1992a), and
1991 (Moore 1992b). The volume for 1992 is in preparation. No archaeological
bibliographies for this region of Texas are known to exist.
The field investigation was conducted on May 23, 1994 with Joseph M. Sanchez
performing the duties of Project Archaeologist. The entire 10 acre tract was examined
utilizing the pedestrian survey method supported by shovel testing. Fifteen shovel tests
were excavated with the greatest number in the area of prehistoric locality L-242. The
rest were dug randomly throughout the project area. Excavated matrix was screened
through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. Shovel test data were recorded on a shovel test log
(Appendix II) and in the field notes. Tests were dug to sterile clay and varied in depth from
15 to 90 cm below the ground surface. The two flakes recovered during shovel testing
were collected and examined but not retained for curation. A field map was made of the
site area and appears as Figure 4 of this report.
Report Preparation
The Principal Investigator performed this task. Field notes were typed, figures
drafted, and a report prepared for review by the Texas Antiquities Committee.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The background check and archival research revealed that the project area had
been previously surveyed by the Archaeology Research Program at SMU in 1980. The
Richland Creek Reservoir project located numerous sites and a single dart point was
observed within the confines of the current project area and the location recorded as a
locality (L-242). A locality card was completed and placed in the site files at TARL.
Although various reports dealing with the Richland Creek Reservoir project were
examined by the author and Jean Hughes at TARL, it was not determined which one
discusses the survey which recorded Locality L-242. It is believed this information may
be in the preliminary survey report published by the Archaeology Research Program
(1980) that was not available at the time of this writing. It is clear from the literature
review, especially the planning document prepared by the Department of Antiquities
Protection (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993), that Freestone County is siutated in an area
containing numerous cultural resources, many of which are very significant in terms of
providing new data regarding the prehistoric past of the region.
Although the primary objective of this investigation was to evaluate prehistoric
locality L-242, the entire 10 acre tract was examined as suggested by Mark Denton of the
Texas Antiquities Committee. The results of this survey were disappointing in that very
little evidence of a prehistoric site was found in the area of L-242.
The area was thoroughly examined by shovel testing and surface inspection of
exposed areas. Two shovel tests produced cultural materials. Shovel Test 1 yielded one
small chert flake at 20-30 cm with no cortex present. It was found in the general vicinity of
prehistoric locality L-242 as indicated on the topographic map (Figure 4). The immediate
area was shovel tested in order to define the horizontal and vertical extent of the
prehistoric locality. Only one other shovel test (ST 7) was positive in terms of producing
cultural material. This test yielded one angular, burned chert flake at 0-10 cm. Of the 15
shovel tests excavated within the 10 acre tract, only the two positive tests mentioned
above yielded cultural materials.
Shovel testing and probing in the immediate area of locality L-242 revealed a
sandy mantle over sterile clay. The depth of the sand in this area varied from 10-70 cm.
In most areas, the sand was shallow with only four tests (ST 1, ST 7, ST 8, and ST 10)
revealing sand deeper than 45 cm. It is hypothesized that these tests were dug in an
isolated pocket of deep sand that is a natural occurrence, or the so-called sand pocket is
the result of erosion from the top of the hill or of displacement of sand during construction
of FM 488.

9

It was obvious during the field survey that the area had been disturbed in recent
times. Several depressions were noted, an indication that the former landform had been
altered. According to Dale Prochaska, in a letter to Timothy K. Perttula, Ph.D. dated May
5, 1994 (Appendix I), the various forms of disturbance known to TPWD are discussed.
These are construction of FM 488 sometime prior to 1987 when TPWD took possession
of the project area, use of the hill top as a borrow area by the Tarrant County Water
Control and Improvement District for material to construct the Woody Road through the
South Unit of RCWMA, and the creation of a campsite and gravel access road on the
hilltop in 1987 by TPWD. In addition to these direct disturbances, natural erosion or
erosion caused by these disturbances has taken place on the hillside.
It is believed that the designation of the area where the dart point was found by
SMU in 1980 and the two flakes during the current investigation as a locality is proper. It
is not possible at this time to positively associate the two flakes found in shovel testing
with the dart point although a relationship is probable. Therefore, the designation of this
area as a locality seems to be correct.
According to Mr. Prochaska, the hill where the locality is situated is approximately
100 x 210 feet in size. The actual size of the locality is estimated at 10 x 10 meters. Since
only two artifacts were found, little can be said about their depth except that they were
found between 0-30 cm.
It is the opinion of BVRA that the locality does not possess significant research
potential and additional work at the site is not warranted. The basis for this statement is
the paucity of artifacts (N=3) and the disturbed context in which they were found. Locality
L-242 is surrounded by three prehistoric sites (41FT146, 41FT147, and 41FT155), all on
the same landform. It seems likely, therefore, that the materials that comprise the locality
may be isolated finds that were deposited by activities related to one of these sites. There
is also another prehistoric site (41FT134) just to the north of L-242.
In summary, new data believed to relate to L-242 were collected. The investigation
was negative in terms of locating additional, unrecorded cultural resources within the 10
acre tract. It is recommended that TPWD be allowed to proceed with construction as
planned. If cultural materials are encountered during the construction phase all work
should cease until the situation is evaluated by the Texas Antiquities Committee.
