MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey for the proposed Nile DU #1H well
pad and associated lease road in eastern Shelby County, Texas. This cultural resources
investigation was conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., under subcontract to Titanium Environmental
Services, LLC, for XTO Energy, Inc., and the Bureau of Land Management. The purpose of this
document is to provide data for use in the management of cultural resources in partial fulfillment
of obligations under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (P.L. 96-515),
as amended, and other cultural resources legislation. Cultural resources investigations consisted
of a records search to identify previous cultural resources surveys conducted in the area and the
archeological and historic sites recorded by those efforts, visual inspection of the project area, and
subsurface investigations via the excavation of screened shovel tests. Fieldwork for this project
was conducted on 19 January 2011. This survey encountered no significant cultural resources in
the project area. Construction of the Nile DU #1H well pad and its associated lease road will
have no adverse effect on any significant cultural resources. Provided the project is carried out as
proposed, no further cultural resources investigations are recommended.

INTRODUCTION

This report presents results of a cultural resources survey conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., (GeoMarine Project No. 30563.02.07) under subcontract to Titanium Environmental Services, LLC,
for XTO Energy, Inc., for the proposed Nile DU #1H well pad and associated lease road (Bureau
of Land Management [BLM] Lease No. TX NM 124678). The proposed project area is located
on an interfluve between Grannies Creek and an unnamed tributary in eastern Shelby County,
Texas (Figure 1). The intersection of Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 139 and County Road (CR) 22514 is located northwest of the project area. The community of Huxley, Texas, is located
approximately 2.7 kilometers (km; 1.7 miles [mi]) to the southeast.
The Nile DU #1H project area consists of a 5.6-acre well pad and 373 meters (m; 1,224 feet [ft])
of lease road right-of-way (ROW). The landscape encompassing the proposed project area is
composed of agricultural operations and managed timberlands. This proposed well pad
infrastructure will be constructed on private property owned by Curtis and Vickie Cooper of
Shelbyville, Texas. The mineral rights, however, are the possession of the BLM, and this project
is therefore under the oversight of that agency. This work was conducted under BLM Cultural
Use Permit No. 103-2920-06-X for review by the BLM Field Office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Fieldwork for this project was initially conducted on 19 January 2011 by Project Archeologist
Christopher Goodmaster and Field Technician Brett Lang. Melissa Green served as the project
Principal Investigator throughout the process of this investigation. As per BLM cultural
resources survey requirements, a minimum buffer area of 10 acres was surveyed around the
proposed well pad location. This resulted in the cultural resources survey of approximately 18.9
acres for this project.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The proposed Nile DU #1H project area is located in the Sabine River valley, which bisects the
Tertiary uplands of the South Central Plains physiographic region in southeastern Shelby County,
Texas (Griffith et al. 2004). This region is characterized by rolling or hummocky plains
underlain by the sands of the Eocene-age Wilcox formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1993).
The project area is situated on an interfluve between Grannies Creek to the south and unnamed
tributaries of Grannies Creek to the north and west at an elevation of approximately 60â65 m
(197â213 ft) above mean sea level on a slope of 0â2 percent (Figure 2). The confluence of these
two streams is located approximately 1.9 km (1.2 mi) to the east, just before Grannies Creek
empties into Toledo Bend Reservoir. The soils of the proposed project area largely consist of the
Alazan-Besner complex. The Alazan-Besner complex consists of areas of comingled soils
composed primarily of the Alazan series and the Besner series. Both series are loamy, siliceous,
semiactive, thermic Aquic Glossudalfs; however, the Alazan series soils tend to be more finegrained (i.e., loam), and Besner series soils are slight more coarse (i.e., fine sandy loam). This soil
complex tends to have a brown to dark grayish brown A horizon over a brown to pale brown E
horizon underlain by a strong brown or reddish yellow Bt/E horizons. The northern half of the
proposed lease road occupies soils of Metcalf-Timpson complex and the Latex series. The
Metcalf-Timpson complex consists of intermingled areas of the relatively poorly drained silt
loams of the Metcalf series with moderately well-drained loams and very fine sandy loams of the
Timpson series. Metcalf series soils are classified as Glossaquic Paleudalfs whereas Timpson
series soils are classified Oxyaquic Glossudalfs. Metcalf soils exhibit A and E horizons of dark
grayish brown and light yellowish brown silt loam, respectively, overlying a series of yellowish
brown loam Bt horizons. Areas of Timpson soils are typically characterized by a dark grayish
brown silt loam A horizon with a sequence of underlying E-BE horizons of yellowish brown to
strong brown fine sandy loam followed by a series of strong brown to yellowish brown loam Bt
horizons. Latex soils are classified as Glossic Paleudalfs and are moderately well drained but
slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy Pleistocene-age sediments over clayey Tertiary-age
deposits on upland terraces. The surface layer consists of a thin, brown fine sandy loam A
horizon over a thin, brown fine sandy loam E horizon followed by a series on Bt and Bt/E
horizons.
The project area is located within the Austroriparian biotic province (Blair 1950; Dice 1943).
Once blanketed by oak-hickory-pine forests, the area now supports loblolly and shortleaf pine and
is locally referred to as the Pineywoods (Gould et al. 1960). This region supports a diverse biotic
community. Mammal species in the area, either presently or historically, include deer
(Odocoileus virginianus), cougar (Puma concolor), feral hogs (Sus scrofa), black bear (Ursus
americanus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.), opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
beaver (Castor sp.), and raccoon (Procyon lotor). Hydrophilic vegetation, such as water oak (Q.
nigra), elm (Ulmus sp.), and black tupelo (N. sylvatica) and numerous aquatic vertebrates and
invertebrates are also common in the area. The climate of the project area is humid and
subtropical, characterized by hot summers and mild winters.

CULTURAL CONTEXT
This section presents a brief synopsis, based on regional archeology, of Native American cultural
chronology and Euro-American history of East Texas. Given the size of the region and the depth
and breadth of cultural complexity that has developed in the area, this discussion must necessarily
be limited in scope. References are provided to supplement the information summarized here.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The earliest known inhabitants of the Pineywoods of East Texas were the broad-spectrum huntergathers loosely referred to as the Paleoindian culture. Over several thousand years, these
nomadic people adopted increasingly restricted territories and targeted the abundant game and
other resources in the region, typically moving in seasonal rounds to procure various foods and
raw materials. During the subsequent cultural period referred to as the Archaic, populations
generally continued this way of life for several millennia based on the abundant nature of
resources in the Pineywoods region. By the Middle Archaic period, the people of East Texas
began cultivating starchy and oily seed plants and, in the Late Archaic period, became active in
expansive intraregional social networks based on trade and shared religious beliefs. Gradually,
the Archaic lifestyle became increasingly sedentary, due in part to increased reliance on
horticulture and the development of ceramics. By the Woodland period, the manufacture and use
of ceramics became widespread. The Woodland period continued to expand in cultural
complexity for at least a millennia, resulting in an increase in settled villages, the expansion of
extensive long-distance trade networks, the construction of burial mounds and the development of
elaborate ritual practices, the domestication and cultivation of native plants, and the rise of
societies led by hereditary leaders. From these roots developed the foundation of the Caddo
culture. Over the last millennia, the Caddo settled in permanent villages and continued the
development of maize agriculture and other effective methods of food gathering, processing, and
storage, as well as elaborate ritual life, ranked societies, mound-building, ancestor veneration,
ritual and political centers, long-distance exchange, warfare, competition, and sophisticated craft
production.
A generalized prehistoric cultural sequence for the East Texas culture area is outlined in Table 1.
Detailed synopses of East Texas prehistoric chronology are provided in other sources and will
therefore not be discussed in this report. For additional information, see Kenmotsu and Perttula
(1993), Perttula (1988), Story (1981, 1985, 1990), and Thurmond (1985, 1988, 1990).

HISTORIC EURO-AMERICAN ERA
The initial European penetration into the general area of East Texas occurred in the middle of the
sixteenth century (ca. 1542; Table 2) when the survivors of the Hernando de Soto Spanish
entrada, led by LuÃ­s de Moscoso de Alvarado after de Sotoâs death, entered Texas, probably
somewhere between present-day Shreveport, Louisiana, and Texarkana, Texas, in their attempt to
reach New Spain by land (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Weddle 1985). In 1690, the Spanish
introduced the first of their missionsâwith the goal of eradicating the indigenous religions and
Christianizing the native populationsâin the Hasinai area of East Texas, but abandoned them in
1693 after failing to convert and control the local population (Swanton 1942:46â49).

The earliest French presence in Texas was led by RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, who
established Fort Saint Louis in 1685 along the Texas coast in present-day Victoria County (Davis
and Bruseth 2000; Fort St. Louis 2009; John 1975:182), followed later by Louis Juchereau de St.
Denis, who in 1714 set up a trading post at Natchitoches in present-day Louisiana, and by BÃ©nard
de la Harpe, who in 1719 began his trading post, Le Poste des Cadodaquious, in present-day
Bowie County (Harper 2002). Spanish fear of an increased French presence in Texas led to the
decision in 1716 to try again to establish a series of buffer missions and presidios in present-day
6

East Texas and Louisiana (Cooper et al. 2003; Pool 1975:28; Swanton 1942:46â49). When
France and Spain went to war over the issue, the French forced the Spanish to abandon the area
(Newcomb 1961:288). However, after the truce in 1721, the French withdraw from Texas, and
the Spanish reestablished the missions and set Los Adaes as the capital of the Province of Texas.
After briefly regaining control of the area, the French sold it to the United States in 1803 as part
of the Louisiana Purchase.
Following the sale of Louisiana in 1803, the United States considered most of Texas to be part of
the Louisiana Purchase and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939). The
area to become Shelby County was known at that time as a refuge for outlaws and fugitives
because of its proximity to the âneutral ground,â a disputed area between Spanish and American
territories until 1806 (Coleman et al. 1984; Neill 1950). The first official American exploration
of the region was by the Freeman-Custis Expedition in 1806 (Flores 1984). The earliest settlers
were largely subsistence farmers residing on small holdings, confined to the areas immediately
adjacent to the Red River, but after 1818, settlement pushed into the prairies along river
tributaries and early roads such as Daytonâs Road and Trammelâs Trace (LaGrone 2008). By
1818, John Latham, the first Anglo-American resident of Shelby County, had settled in the
southeastern portion of the area (Harper 2009).
After Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821, the Mexican government first organized
Shelby County as part of the Nacogdoches Municipality and established Nashville as the county
seat in 1824 (Coleman et al. 1984; Harper 2009). For the most part, East Texas was beyond the
direct range of the 1835â1836 battles for Texas independence that took place primarily in South
and Central Texas. In 1836, the Congress of the Republic of Texas officially named Shelby
County after Isaac Shelby, a Revolutionary War hero and governor of Kentucky (Coleman et al.
1984:19; Harper 2009). By 1847, the county population had grown to approximately 3,500
residents (Coleman et al. 1984:19; Harper 2009).
Texas traded its independence for U.S. statehood on 29 December 1845, entering the union as the
twenty-eighth state. The majority of the settlers moving into Shelby County came from other
Southern states and thus introduced large-scale agriculture, livestock raising, and slavery (Harper
2009), although slave ownership was not predominant in Shelby County. After the presidential
election of 1860, Texas began to consider secession, since the sympathies of most of the AngloAmerican residents of Texas lay with the South. On 1 February 1861, Texas became part of the
Confederate States of America (Harper 2009). Shelby County wholeheartedly supported the war
effort of the Confederacy (Harper 2009), with an estimated 750 men from Shelby County serving
in either Texas or Confederate army units (Harper 2009). The defeat of the Confederacy in 1865
brought about the end of slavery in Texas, the breakdown of the old slave-based plantation
system, a distressed economy, and the presence of a Union army of occupation (Harper 2009).
After the Civil War, the large plantations were broken up and partially sold off to speculators and
investors, and the majority of former slaves and poor whites became sharecroppers (Harper
2009). The town of Center officially became the Shelby County seat in 1866 and currently
retains this title (Harper 2009). After 1870, as the population began to gradually increase and the
railroads arrived, the region began to recover from the worst effects of the war. The lumber
industry began to grow (Coleman et al. 1984:19; Harper 2009) as railroads allowed transportation
of lumber from timber-rich Polk, Angelina, San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Trinity, and
Nacogdoches counties. Small towns along the rail routes and sawmills to process this lumber
sprang up throughout these East Texas counties (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:824), but small,
7

owner-operated farming continued to be important. By 1940 agriculture and population began a
slow, steady increase (Harper 2009), even though the population of Shelby County declined after
World War II. However, by 1970, the population again rose after the Sabine River Authority was
created in 1950 and Toledo Bend Reservoir was dedicated in 1960 (Coleman et al. 1984:22).
Leading the present economy of Shelby County are sawmills and timber/lumber-related industries
as well as farming and lignite coal, sand, oil, and gas production (Harper 2009). The Sabine
National Forest also currently contributes to the economy by attracting recreational tourism and
through lumber, grazing, hunting, and oil production (Harper 2009; Miller and Tull 1984).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND METHODOLOGY
The cultural resources survey recorded in this document was designed to identify both prehistoric
and historic archeological sites along with important architectural resources located within the
Nile DU #1H project area. This work was undertaken with two primary management goals in
mind:
1. To locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey areas
2. To assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
The first of these goals was accomplished by a program of background and archival research,
intensive pedestrian survey, and excavations undertaken using the field methods described in this
section. The second goal consists of assessment and evaluation based on National Register
criteria defined in 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Â§60.4 (National Park Service 1990).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN THE PROJECT AREA
To determine previous cultural resources survey efforts and the locations of previously recorded
historic or archeological resources in the project area, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas online
database maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) was consulted. Review of THC
records indicated that two previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted within a 1.6km (1-mi) radius of the project area. One survey, located approximately 1.5 km (0.9 mi) to the
southwest of the proposed Nile DU #1H project area, was conducted for BLM purposes in 2001.
Unfortunately, no further details regarding that survey were available in the THC database.
Another survey was conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., for the proposed Amazon DU #1H well pad,
located approximately 1.1 km (0.7 km) to the northwest, in November 2010 and January 2011
(Goodmaster 2011; Table 3). Site 41SY348, a twentieth-century domestic midden with no
architectural remains or intact cultural features, was identified during the Amazon DU #1H
survey and was recommended to be not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Goodmaster
2011:20â26). Site 41SY348 is located over 1.1 km (0.7 mi) northwest of the proposed project
area and will not be adversely affected by the construction of the Nile DU #1H infrastructure.
Various sources of historical and geographic data were consulted to ascertain the likelihood of
historic-era structural resources existing within the proposed project area. These sources include
topographic maps (which often record cultural resources such as cemeteries, houses, and related
features) and aerial photography. Based on a review of these historic records and previously
recorded archeological site locations, it is evident that the region in general has experienced a

dynamic history. Evaluating these sources with more recent records, however, indicates that the
substantial development has occurred in recent years, altering much of the historic landscape.
Furthermore, cross-referencing the locations of nearby previously recorded cultural resources
with geomorphic features such as landforms and soils suggests that prehistoric occupation of the
region was typically confined to upland escarpments and areas adjacent to perennial streams.
Historic period habitation within the region was minimal during the nineteenth century; however,
settlement increased markedly during the twentieth century.

METHODOLOGY

Survey Methods
Based on the background and archival research conducted, it was determined that the proposed
Nile DU #1H project area had a moderate probability of containing prehistoric cultural sites based
on the presence of localized areas of well-drained, sandy soils and its proximity to Grannies
Creek. Given the amount of groundcover and the nature of archeological sites in the region, it
was assumed that ground visibility in the project area would not be conducive to visual inspection
and that subsurface excavation via shovel testing would be necessary to adequately survey the
area. Shovel tests consisted of hand-excavated units 30â40 cm (11.8â15.7 in) in diameter
excavated in 20-cm (7.9-in) levels, with the excavated soil passed through a 0.64-cm (0.25-in)
hardware mesh screen to recover artifacts. The location of each shovel test was recorded with a
submeter-accurate TrimbleÂ® GeoXTâ¢ global positioning system (GPS) unit, and the exposed
soil profile documented. Each shovel test was backfilled upon completion of the recording
process.

SURVEY RESULTS
This section presents the results of the cultural resources survey and assesses the effects of the
proposed Nile DU #1H project on cultural resources in the vicinity. Management considerations
and recommendations based on the findings of this survey are presented in the final section.

BACKGROUND AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH RESULTS
Review of THC records indicated that two previous cultural resources investigations have been
conducted within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project area and one previously recorded site is
located within the search radius. Site 41SY348, a twentieth-century domestic midden with no
9

architectural remains or intact cultural features, is located over 1.1 km (0.7 mi) northwest of the
proposed project area (Goodmaster 2011:20â26) and will not be adversely affected by the
construction of the Nile DU #1H infrastructure. Archival research focused on the historic period
settlement in the immediate vicinity of the project area. The 1863 von Rosenburg map of the
Sabine River valley indicates that the Harris and Latham farmsteads existed on the opposite side
of Grannies Creek, approximately 1.6 km (1 mi) south of the proposed project area while the
Golden farmstead was located approximately 1.6 km (1 mi) north. In the early twentieth century,
Wimberlyâs Gin was located approximately 0.5 km (0.3 mi) to the southwest, as evidenced by the
1937 Sabine National Forest 1:126,000-scale topographic map. By the mid-twentieth century,
several primary structures existed in the vicinity of the project area, as depicted on the 1944
United States Geological Survey (USGS) Logansport 15-minute (1:62,000-scale) topographic
map. A review of historic aerial photography indicates that little development, aside from
residential and agricultural development, has occurred in the vicinity of the project area in the
mid-to-late-twentieth century.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY RESULTS
The proposed Nile DU #1H project area was intensively investigated to determine the presence of
cultural resources using a combined technique of systematic visual reconnaissance and the
excavation of screened shovel tests. Approximately 18.9 acres were investigated, with nine
shovel tests excavated as part of this cultural resources survey (Figure 3).
The Nile DU #1H project area occupies an interfluve between Grannies Creek to the south and
unnamed tributaries of Grannies Creek to the north and west. The proposed project area supports
a mixed hardwood forest (Figure 4) and is adjacent to areas of managed pine silviculture,
agricultural operations, and rural residences.
A modern residence, several associated
outbuildings, and a stock pond are located immediately east of the proposed lease road and an
additional stock pond exists north of the proposed well pad location (Figure 5). Groundcover
within the project area consisted primarily of leaf litter; however, the lease road occupies a rural
residential lot with a manicured lawn. The topography is hummocky, with several low-lying,
periodically inundated areas dispersed between prominent rises. Shovel testing targeted many of
these localized rises (Figure 6). In general, soil profiles exposed within shovel tests consisted of a
thin (10 cm [4 in]) fine sandy loam A horizon that ranged from brown (10YR 4/3) to yellowish
brown (10YR 5/4) overlying a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4 to 10YR 5/6) B horizon (Table 4).
Redoximorphic features, typically exhibited as concretions or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) soil
mottling, were present at depths greater than 70 cm (27 in) in some shovel tests.
No artifacts were encountered on the surface or in any of the shovel tests excavated within the
proposed Nile DU #1H project area. This cultural resources survey encountered no cultural
resources, as defined under 36 CFR 60.4. The area affected by the proposed Nile DU #1H project
holds a very low probability of containing significant cultural resources.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This cultural resources survey was conducted to document and assess cultural resources within
the proposed Nile DU #1H project area and to provide adequate and relevant information for use
in the management of cultural resources within the project area. One previously recorded
archeological site, 41SY348, within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the project area will not be adversely
affected by the proposed project. All shovel tests within the proposed project area were found to
be negative for artifacts and other cultural materials. No historic properties as defined under 36
CFR 60.4 were identified during this cultural resources investigation of the project area. The area
affected by the Nile DU #1H project holds a very low probability of containing significant
cultural resources.
Based on the results of this survey, there is a very low potential for deposits containing
archeological materials within the proposed project area. Given the lack of cultural resources in
the project area, it is recommended that the proposed construction will not adversely affect any
significant cultural resources. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2), it is recommended that no
further cultural resources investigation is necessary. Consequently, it is recommended that
construction be allowed to proceed. However, in the unlikely event that evidence of
archeological deposits is encountered during construction, it is recommended that work in the
immediate area immediately cease and representatives of the THC and the BLM are contacted
and made aware of the inadvertent discovery.
