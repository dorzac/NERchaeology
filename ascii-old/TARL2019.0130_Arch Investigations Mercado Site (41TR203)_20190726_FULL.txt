ABSTRACT
On behalf of North Tarrant Infrastructure (NTI), aci consulting conducted survey, testing, and
data recovery investigations at the Mercado site (41TR203), a prehistoric multi-component site
in the Interstate Highway 35W (I-35W) right-of-way (ROW) along the West Fork of the Trinity
River in Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Texas for the North Tarrant Expressway (NTE), Segment
3A Project. The work was done in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act and
the Antiquities Code of Texas. The survey and testing investigations were conducted under
Texas Antiquities Permit 6635, with Dr. Ann M. Scott serving as Principal Investigator.
Subsequent data recovery investigations were performed under Permit 6753, first with Dr. Scott
and then Julie Shipp serving as Principal Investigator.
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) is defined as the existing and proposed ROW straddling the
existing lanes of I-35W and extending from near the edge of the West Fork of the Trinity River
north for approximately 1,000 feet (ft) (304 meters [m]). The width of the APE varies from 200
to 282 ft (60 to 86 m) on the west side of I-35W and from 52 to 190 ft (15 to 58 m) on the east
side of I-35W. Vertical impacts at the bridge for drill shafts are about 60 ft (18 m) deep from the
ground surface into bedrock. Other impacts include excavating the ground surface to a depth of
approximately 4 to 5 ft (1.2 to 1.5 m) near the northern end of the APE. Most of the
improvements consist of fill placement on the existing ground surface. Thus, the APE
encompasses 10.232 acres in total, on both sides of the existing I-35W roadway, with vertical
impacts of up to 60 ft (18 m). All parcels comprising the APE are owned by the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Investigations focused on Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric components that would be subject to project impacts. Survey and testing occurred
during 2009 and 2013, respectively. The data recovery investigations were conducted during the
spring and summer of 2014.
A series of Analytical Units (AUs), representing well-preserved, temporally and culturally
distinct prehistoric occupations that occurred on the river terraces of the West Fork of the Trinity
River, were identified using multiple lines of archeological and geomorphic data, including
microstratigraphy. Radiocarbon dates indicate a range of seasonal, intermittent occupations that

occurred from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods (2600-500 year[s] calibrated
before present [yr Cal BP]).
The Late Archaic component at the Mercado site (principally AUs 6-8) formed on a relatively
stable surface for about 600 years (approximately 2700-2100 yr Cal BP). The lithic assemblage
was limited in variability, containing only a few stone tool forms and types; however, the tools
and debitage indicate a fair degree of initial-stage tool manufacture and reduction, and more
commonly the later and final stages of formal tool manufacturing. There was also considerable
sharpening or rejuvenation of tools before they were discarded. The site is interpreted as an open,
seasonally occupied (spring to fall) campsite in the context of a local environment with a broad
spectrum of resources, including riverine, woodland, and grassland habitats. Their prey ranged
from small mammals and aquatic life to deer and bison. The larger prey was commonly killed
and processed off-site, but there were some evidence of whole specimens of both deer and bison
being processed at the camp.
During the Late/Transitional Archaic Period at the Mercado site, mussels became a more
prominent food source, but the subsistence strategy continued to include variable and broadspectrum hunting and collection activities. Plant processing within earth ovens is evident during
this transitional period. The Late Prehistoric component at the site is indicative of a hunting
encampment focused on deer, broad-spectrum small mammals, amphibians, and reptiles. Small
hearth/earth oven features also preserved significant evidence of plant food processing.
There are discernible trends in the subsistence data that indicate changes in occupational
intensity, subsistence, and inferentially group size. At the same time, the technological
consistency of burned rock features suggests a long-lived subsistence pattern, stretching from the
Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. This subsistence pattern was perhaps made possible by the
location of the site, which is situated on a relatively stable surface at the convergence of riverine,
woodland, and grassland habitats.
Site 41TR203 is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for
State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation. The site is NRHP eligible under Criterion D

for having yielded information important to our understanding of prehistory. The site qualifies as
a SAL according to the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas
Administrative Code [TAC], Title 13, Chapter 26), as the site is situated on state-owned
property. Furthermore, the site qualifies for formal designation as a SAL under 13 TAC 26.10
(subpart A(1)).

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The Mercado site investigations took place intermittently over the course of five years and
involved the efforts of a remarkable team, some of whom remained involved throughout, some
who left but then came back in the end, and some who just shined for their moment during the
Project. You are all invaluable. Thanks to everyone for working overtime to get it done.
This Project would not have been possible without the assistance and coordination of Jennifer
Oshel, Environmental Compliance Manager for North Tarrant Infrastructure; and Stan Reece,
Vice President, and Kevin Ramberg, Chief Operating Officer, at aci consulting. We appreciate
their commitment to the Project.
The authors would like to express gratitude for the guidance and inspiration from Texas
Department of Transportation archeologists, Eric Oksanen and Dr. Scott Pletka, and Texas
Historical Commission archeologists, Arlo McKee, Bill Martin, and Mark Denton (retired). Eric
Oksanen and Arlo McKee were also researchers for this investigation. Eric provided a study that
he conducted on Gary points, and Arlo conducted the geoarcheological investigations along with
Dr. Charles Frederick.
The stellar field crews who were part of this investigation maintained high levels of
professionalism and morale despite harsh weather of all seasons and prairie winds that at times
threatened to land us in Oklahoma. The crew for the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) testing phase consisted of Jennifer Hatchett Kimbell, Bennett Kimbell, Michael Smith,
Tess Noble, Sarah Loftus, and Jonathon Comer. The data recovery team consisted of Rosemarie
Pavel, Michael Smith, Ruben Castillo, Stephanie Martin, Megan Egan, Don Baden, Jonathon
Comer, Robin Polseno, Patrick Gainey, Bennet Kimbell, and Jennifer Hatchett Kimbell. Jennifer
also served as Project Archeologist, Field Lab Director, TDS Mapper, and GIS Specialist.
Dr. Robin Benson Barnes, Katie Canavan, and Nicole Inskeep supervised the laboratory and
curatorial duties in various phases of the Project. Megan Lamont served as GIS Specialist. Julie
Shipp was Principal Investigator (PI) for the analysis and reporting phases of the investigation
and was involved from the beginning of the Project.

Dr. Ann M. Scott was the original ringleader of this operation, serving as the PI throughout
NRHP testing and data recovery fieldwork, and coming back into the fold to help coordinate the
reporting. This Project benefitted immensely from her involvement.
As usual, Dr. Charles Frederick contributed significantly to our understanding of the site, from
providing unofficial guidance during the NRHP testing phase to conducting the geoarcheology
investigations during the data recovery, and essentially being on-call.
aci consulting had the pleasure of teaming with Principal Investigators from other companies and
their teams to compile this report. Those individuals are Dr. Ann M. Scott and Dr. David Yelacic
from Terracon, Dr. Mary Jo Galindo from Galindo ENV, and Dr. James W. Karbula from
PaleoWest. Mary Jo Galindo and James W. Karbula provided expert review of the research in
the final phases. Katie Canavan and Megan Cochran graciously accepted the challenge of
formatting and editing this report.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Report Title: Data Recovery of the Mercado Site (41TR203), A Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric
Open Occupation Campsite in the Deep Terraces of the West Fork of the Trinity River in Fort
Worth, Tarrant County, Texas
Report Date: July 2019
Report Number: 12-13-027
Agency: Texas Department of Transportation
Texas Antiquties Permit Number: Data Recovery 6753, NRHP Testing 6635
Project Description: The North Tarrant Expressway (NTE), Segment 3A Project (or Project)
includes road expansion activities for the relief of traffic congestion along the corridors of
Interstate Highway 820 (I-820), Interstate Highway 35W (I-35W), and State Highway 183
(SH 183) in the cities of Fort Worth, Haltom City, North Richard Hills, Bedford, and Euless in
Tarrant County, Texas. aci consulting conducted Phase III data recovery at the Mercado site
(41TR203) within the new right-of-way (ROW) acquired for the NTE Project by the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) (on Parcels 852-west and 853-east). Phase III
archeological data recovery was conducted consistent with the requirements of the Texas Natural
Resources Code Title 9, Chapter 191 (Antiquities Code of Texas) and Section 106 (36 Code of
Federal Regulations [CFR] 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Coordination
with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) under the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) and
Section 106 of the NHPA of 1992, as amended, was conducted in advance of the proposed road
expansion and related activities. Data recovery excavations were conducted under TAC Permit
6753 as mitigation for the adverse effects proposed to prehistoric archeological site 41TR203.
The purpose of the Phase III data recovery was to ensure that the site was mitigated before the
road expansion construction began and to fulfill TAC and Section 106 requirements. A summary
of survey and testing investigations previously conducted under TAC Permit 6635 is presented in
this report.

The APE is currently defined as the existing and proposed ROW extending from near the edge of
the West Fork of the Trinity River north for approximately 1,000 feet (ft) (304 meters [m]). The
APE covers a total area of about 10.232 acres and includes both sides of I-35W. The width varies
from 200 to 282 ft (60 to 86 m) on the west side of I-35W and from 52 to 190 ft (15 to 58 m) on
the east side of I-35W. Impacts at the bridge for the drill shafts are about 60 ft (18 m) deep from
the ground surface into bedrock. Other impacts include excavation of the ground surface to a
depth of approximately 4 to 5 ft (1.2 to 1.5 m) near the northern end of the APE. Most of the
improvements consist of fill placement on the existing ground surface. All parcels are owned by
TxDOT. No work took place on private property.
The conditions of TAC Permit 6753 included the hand excavation of 34.8â40.8 cubic meters
3
(m ) of sediments at the site. Data recovery conducted by aci consulting occurred in two

investigations during the spring and summer of 2014. The required volume of hand-excavated
sediments was not achieved during the first phase of fieldwork. During the second phase, the
THC, in coordination with TxDOT, allowed a modified scope of work to maximize data
collection in the time remaining. Overall, a total of 86 1 square meter (m2) excavation units
(EUs) and a 17-m-long trench were excavated within the APE. The trench was excavated for
geoarcheological purposes and was extended to a width of 3.4 m by the end of the data recovery.
Fifteen 1-m by0.5-m EUs were placed within the trench over exposed features. A total of 44
features were recorded during the data recovery investigation, including 32 from the block
excavations and 12 from the trench and trench extension. The excavated features consisted of
small basin hearths, mussel shell scatters and middens, burned rock middens, pits, and a cachelike lithic concentration. In total, 36.9 m3 of sediments were excavated during the two data
recovery investigations led by aci consulting. Of the 36.9 m3, 23.8 m3 were excavated by hand
and 13.1 m3 by mechanical trenching.
In total, 8,346 faunal remains were recovered and analyzed. Additionally, 64 liters of soil matrix
were submitted for flotation analysis. Lithics included 390 pieces of debitage and 22 tools,
including bifaces, projectile points, and unifaces. Mussel shell and burned earth were also
collected and analyzed.

CHAPTER 1 â INTRODUCTION

By: Julie Shipp and James W. Karbula
The North Tarrant Expressway (NTE) Project (or Project) includes road expansion activities for the
relief of traffic congestion along the corridors of Interstate Highway 820 (I-820), Interstate
Highway 35W (I-35W), and State Highway 183 (SH 183) in the cities of Fort Worth, Haltom City,
North Richard Hills, Bedford, and Euless in Tarrant County, Texas. aci consulting conducted
Phase III data recovery at the Mercado site (41TR203) within the new right-of-way (ROW)
acquired for the NTE Project by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) (on Parcels
852-west and 853-east). Phase III archeological data recovery was conducted consistent with the
requirements of the Texas Natural Resources Code Title 9, Chapter 191 (Antiquities Code of
Texas) and Section 106 (36 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 800) of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA). Coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) under the
Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) and Section 106 of the NHPA of 1992, as amended, was conducted
in advance of proposed road expansion and related activities. Data recovery excavations were
conducted under TAC Permit 6753 in mitigation to proposed adverse effects to prehistoric
archeological site 41TR203. The purpose of the Phase III data recovery was to ensure that the site
was mitigated before the road expansion construction began, and to fulfill TAC and Section 106
requirements. A summary of survey and testing investigations previously conducted under TAC
Permit 6635 are presented in this report.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is defined as the existing and proposed ROW extending from
near the edge of the West Fork of the Trinity River heading north for approximately 1,000 feet (ft)
(304 meters [m]) (Figures 1.1 and 1.2). The APE covers about 10.232 acres on both sides of I35W. The width varies from 200 to 282 ft (60 to 86 m) on the west side of I-35W and from 52 to
190 ft (15 to 58 m) on the east side of I-35W. Impacts at the bridge for the drill shafts are about 60
ft (18 m) deep from the ground surface into bedrock. Other impacts include excavating the ground
surface approximately 4 to 5 ft (1.2 to 1.5 m) near the northern end of the APE. Most of the
improvements consist of placing fill on the existing ground surface. All parcels are owned by
TxDOT. No work took place on private property.

Methods employed were coordinated in detail with TxDOT to ensure THC concurrence with
hand-excavated units as well as mechanical trenching that occurred during the data recovery.
Revised methods that were employed during the data recovery were concurred upon by both
TxDOT and THC before the change in effort was conducted.
The conditions of the TAC Permit 6753 included the hand excavation of 34.8 to 40.8 m3 of
sediments at the site. Data recovery conducted by aci consulting occurred in two investigations
during the spring and summer of 2014. The required volume of hand-excavated sediments was not
achieved during the first phase of fieldwork. During the second phase, the THC, in coordination
with TxDOT, allowed a modified scope of work to maximize data collection in the time remaining.
Overall, a total of 86 1 by 1-m excavation units (EUs) and a 17-m-long trench were excavated
within the APE. The trench was excavated for geoarcheological purposes and was extended to a
width of 3.4 m by the end of the data recovery. Fifteen 1 by 0.5-m EUs were placed within the
trench over exposed features. A total of 44 features were recorded during the data recovery
investigation, including 32 from the block excavations and 12 from the trench and trench
extension. The excavated features consisted of small basin hearths, mussel shell scatters and
middens, burned rock middens, pits, and a cache-like lithic concentration. In total, 36.9 m3 were
excavated during the two data recovery investigations led by aci consulting. Of the 36.9 m3, 23.8
m3 were excavated by hand and 13.1 m3 by mechanical trenching.
In total, 8,346 faunal remains were recovered and analyzed. Additionally, 64 liters of soil matrix
were submitted for flotation analysis. Lithics included 390 pieces of debitage and 22 tools,
including bifaces, projectile points, and unifaces. Mussel shell and burned earth were also collected
and analyzed.
The investigations at site 41TR203 encountered buried features consisting of bone, mussel shell,
fire-cracked rock (FCR), lithics, and charcoal located within a series of stratified substantial
cultural occupation zones. Using multiple lines of archeological and geomorphic data, including
microstratigraphy, a series of Analytical Units (AUs) were identified representing temporally and
culturally distinct aboriginal occupations that occurred on the river terraces of the West Fork of the
Trinity River. Radiocarbon dates indicate a range of seasonal, intermittent occupations that
occurred from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric sociocultural intervals (approximately 2600

to 500 years calibrated before present [yr Cal BP]). This series of occupation zones exhibits
outstanding context and organic preservation especially in faunal, mollusk, and botanical remains.
Data from the site addresses research questions regarding changes in subsistence strategies and
technology from the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods in north Central Texas, particularly
on sites along the West Fork of the Trinity River.
Site 41TR203 is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for
State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation. The site is NRHP eligible under Criterion D for
having yielded information important to our understanding of prehistory. The site qualifies as a
SAL according to the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas (TAC,
Title 13, Chapter 26), as the property is situated on state-owned property. Furthermore, the site
qualifies for formal designation as a SAL under 13 TAC 26.10 (subpart A(1).
1.1

Introduction

TxDOT proposed road expansion activities for the relief of traffic congestion along the corridors of
I-820, I-35W, and SH 183 in the cities of Fort Worth, Haltom City, North Richard Hills, Bedford,
and Euless in Tarrant County, Texas. On behalf of TxDOT and to fulfill requirements under
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1992, as amended, for Segment
3A of the NTE Project, aci consulting conducted Phase III data recovery at site 41TR203, which
was located within the new ROW acquired by TxDOT for the NTE Project (on Parcels 852-west
and 853-east) (see Figures 1.1 and 1.2). Site 41TR203 is a stratified prehistoric site considered
eligible for the NRHP under Criterion D and for designation as a SAL under Criteria 1 and 2 of the
Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas.
1.2

Site Setting

Segment 3A is approximately 8.4 miles (mi) (13.5 kilometers [km]) long, and for design and
construction purposes, is divided into two segments. The North Segment consists of the I-820/I35W Interchange and includes sections of I-820 east and west from Mark IV Parkway to North
Beach Street, a portion of I-35W north of the interchange to Fossil Creek Boulevard, and a portion
of I-35W south of the interchange. The South Segment begins with the southern boundary of the
North Segment (near IH30) and includes work on US Highway 287. The South Segment also
includes a portion of the frontage road.

The boundary of site 41TR203 has been extended onto the ROW on the east side of I-35W, which
was the location of the Phase I survey at site 41TR202. The cultural deposits in the area correlated
more closely with site 41TR203, rather than with site 41TR202. The APE is located within the
South Segment of the NTE Segment 3A Project ROW, on the northern bank of the West Fork of
the Trinity River as it crosses I-35W.
Site 41TR203 is in an open grassy field primarily on the west side of I-35W but extends through
the interstate and continues to the east side as well. The new extended site boundary encompasses
239,214 m2 on the west side of I-35W and 4,909 m2 on the east side of I-35W, for a total of
244,123 m2. Both the eastern and western sides of I-35W are cultivated agricultural fields. The
western boundary of site 41TR203 abuts the Trinity River. Historic aerials depict the meandering
of the Trinity River almost touching the northwestern boundary of the site (see Chapter 6). The
area has been severely impacted over the years by previous roadway construction, maintenance,
agriculture, and the channelization of the Trinity River. Despite the urban setting and previous
impacts, the APE remains primarily intact.
The surface geology at site 41TR203 is mapped as Holocene alluvium (Barnes 1972). The soil is
mapped as Frio silty clay, 0-1 percent slopes, which formed within loamy and clayey calcareous
alluvium and typically exhibits an A1-A2-A3-A4-Bk profile. Frio soils are a Cumulic Haplustoll,
which have a mollic epipedon at least 50 centimeters (cm) thick and have a texture finer than
loamy fine sand. Frio soils also exhibit an irregular decrease in organic content and have a slope of
less than 25 percent. Frio soils have a high potential for both shallow and deeply buried
archeological components (Abbott 2011).
The site lies within the West Fork Soil, which formed at the top of the Pilot Point Alloformation,
and is located near the ground surface, underneath the plow zone at 41TR203. The West Fork Soil
was first identified by Ferring (1986) and dates to the Late Holocene. West Fork Soil is the surface
soil on the Trinity River floodplain in some places, and in other places, it is buried by recent
alluvium (Ferring 1986). Numerous projects have dated the West Fork Soil where it is buried by
the recent alluvium, but few have examined the West Fork Soil where it is the surface soil
(Frederick 2011). One potential research benefit from excavations at site 41TR203 was to further
define the West Fork deposits at the site and to more closely correlate this natural stratigraphic and

presented in Chapter 6.
1.3

Previous Investigations Near APE

A literature review of the THC (2018) Archeological and Historic Sites Atlas databases (Atlas)
revealed that no sites other than 41TR202 and 42TR203 have been recorded within 1 km of the
Project APE. Four archeological surveys have been conducted within 1 km of the Project APE. In
2000, a linear survey sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) was conducted
on the south side of the Trinity River. A report documenting the results of the survey was not
located, but no affiliated sites are listed in Atlas. Geoarcheological coring was conducted near the
project area as well as to the northwest along the Trinity River (Osburn et al. 2005; discussed
below). No archeological resources were discovered during a survey conducted prior to railroad
system improvements west of the project area (Tinsley and Forbes 2010). Two historic sites were
recorded during an additional survey related to railroad corridor improvements west of the project
area, but neither is located within 1 km of the proposed project area (Green and Hunt 2010).
Site 41TR198 is located approximately 3.4 km (2.1 mi) southeast of the APE, downstream from
sites 41TR202 and 41TR203, and on the northern bank of the West Fork of the Trinity River
(Figure 1.3). Site 41TR198 had stratified components dating from the Late Archaic to the Late
Prehistoric periods and contained a significant amount of well-preserved faunal remains as well as
burned rock features and bone and shell lenses (Peter and Harrison 2011). The natural and cultural
deposits at 41TR198 are comparable to site 41TR203.
1.4

Previous Investigations at 41TR203

Site 41TR203 was originally located through geoarcheological coring conducted by Geo-Marine
for the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 2005 under TAC Permit 3704 in
association with the Central City Hydraulic Mitigation Areas Project (Osburn et al. 2005; Figure
1.4). During this initial investigation, 66 cores were excavated in areas that were considered to
have a high probability for archeological sites within three zones: Zone 3A for the hydraulic
mitigation, Zone 3B for dam construction, and Zone 3C for recreation zones. Sites 41TR202 and
41TR203 were located within the eastern half of Zone 3C. Site 41TR202 was identified on the

within Cores 5 and 6 to a depth of 234 cm (7.6 ft) below the surface (cmbs).

No cultural materials were observed within the cores excavated at site 41TR202. Cultural materials
on the surface consisted of a scatter of mussel shell and burned rock that spanned approximately
35 m (115 ft) northwest to southeast. Previous investigators concluded that this site was likely to
contain buried cultural deposits and should be subject to further investigation (Osburn et al. 2005).
Cultural material was located on the surface and from 45 to 234 cmbs (1.5 to 7.7 ft) within the
cores at site 41TR203. The cores were excavated to 366 cmbs (12 ft). A scatter of mussel shell,
burned rock, and one chert flake were observed on the surface between cores 5 and 6. Burned clay,
bone, charcoal, and mussel shell were identified throughout the core profiles. Radiocarbon dates
from charcoal identified within the cores, as well as the types of cultural materials and their
distribution, led investigators to suggest that the site contained Late Archaic components separated
by alluvial events. Additional testing was recommended (Osburn et al. 2005).
Backhoe trenching was conducted by SWCA Environmental Consultants in 2009 for the Expedited
Intensive Archeological Survey at the West Fork Trinity River, Tarrant County Project, which
consisted of the widening of the I-35W roadway and bridge construction for TxDOT under TAC
Permit 4924 (Galindo and Lawrence 2009; see Figure 1.4). Investigators did not have access to the
east side ROW at the time; therefore, that area was not investigated to determine if site 41TR202
was present. Eight backhoe trenches were excavated at site 41TR203 within the APE, which
consisted of the existing and proposed I-35W ROW. Six of the eight trenches were positive for
cultural material (see Figure 1.4). Three features were identified, including two burned rock
features and one concentration of shell and bone. The site appeared to contain at least three
discrete, buried cultural components from about 60 to 80 cmbs (25 to 30 inches), 100 to 150 cmbs
(40 to 60 inches), and 280 to 300 cmbs (110 to 120 inches). The cultural material consisted of
charcoal, bone, burned rock, mussel shell, and one chert flake. The West Fork Soil was identified at
the site as well. Site 41TR203 was recommended for NRHP testing, and site 41TR202 was
recommended for additional survey to confirm the presence or absence of the site within the APE
(Galindo and Lawrence 2009).
1.5

NRHP Testing

aci consulting conducted a Phase I survey to locate site 41TR202 within the APE and conducted
Phase II NRHP testing at site 41TR203 in August 2013. Ten backhoe trenches and seven EUs were
placed at site 41TR203, and four trenches and one 50 by 50-cm test unit (TU) were excavated in
Mercado Site (41TR203)

the APE on the east side of the highway, where it was probable that a portion of site 41TR203
would be located (see Figure 1.4). The natural and cultural deposits were similar on both sides of
the highway, and the decision was made to include the cultural material on the east side of the
highway as part of site 41TR203.
The cultural materials were consistent with the materials located during the 2009 survey, including
burned rock, mussel shell, bone, charcoal, and scant lithic material. One chert flake and one chert
biface were the only lithics located during the testing investigation. Some possible daub was
recovered. Two burned rock features were excavated.
Previouis investigaations documented three cultural components at site 41TR203, encompassing
both sides of the highway. The component at 270 to 300 cmbs that was reported from the expedited
survey in 2009 was not relocated during the current investigation. However, a shallower
component, which is mostly still intact below the plow zone, was located. The three cultural
components are located at depths of approximately 25 to 45 cmbs, 60 to 80 cmbs, and 100 to 120
cmbs. Radiocarbon dates from previous investigations at site 41TR203 confirm that the three
components date to the Late Archaic period from approximately 2210 to 1590 yr Cal BP.
1.6

Summary of Archeological Work Performed

Prior to fieldwork, aci consulting conducted background literature research using all available
publications, site files (including the NRHP site files), and United States Geological Survey
(USGS) topographic quadrangle maps (both modern and historic). The purpose of the archival
research was to identify any previously recorded archeological sites (to procure site forms), historic
structures, districts, historical markers, properties listed on the NRHP, and SALs that overlapped
the project area. Additionally, this data served as a basis for understanding the archeological impact
on the area from the past to present. The literature search identified previously recorded sites and
surveys within a 1-km buffer around the APE. Site forms were obtained from the THC database for
review and to update with the necessary changes based on the data recovery. United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil maps and USGS geologic maps were consulted to
determine the relative depth of Quaternary or Holocene alluvial deposits at site 41TR203.
Between February 12 and March 22, 2014, aci consulting archeologists conducted the first phase of
data recovery excavation at site 41TR203 on the north bank of the West Fork of the Trinity River.

During initial data recovery, 33 features were recorded within three discrete zones. The three
occupation zones date to the Late Archaic period from approximately 2500 yr Cal BP to 1500 yr
Cal BP. An additional data recovery investigation was performed between June 9 and 17, 2014 to
fulfill the TAC permit. In the second phase of investigation, 11 more features were recorded.
All field investigations were consistent with the requirements of Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the
NHPA of 1966 (as amended, 1992) and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation
Act of 1990. All work met acceptable professional and safety standards. Personnel met the
requirements listed under the Secretary of the Interior Standards for Archeology and Historic
Preservation.
All artifacts collected in the field were temporarily transferred to the aci consulting laboratory in
Austin, Texas, where they were cleaned, cataloged, labeled, and analyzed. Data was entered into a
database to facilitate analysis and report production. Artifacts were processed for curation in
accordance with the 36 CFR Part 79 and in accordance with the curation agreement entered into by
aci consulting and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) curation facility. TxDOT
provided artifact inventory forms for analysis. All artifacts were processed, analyzed, and prepared
for curation consistent with TARL standards.

CHAPTER 2 â ENVIRONMENT AND CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY

By: Mary Jo Galindo
2.1

Environment

Archeological site 41TR203 is within the floodplain of the West Fork of the Trinity River
straddling I-35W in Fort Worth, Texas. While the site boundary was extended to the eastern side of
the highway, the data recovery investigations were conducted exclusively on the western side
where the site deposits were concentrated. Elevation at the site is approximately 520 ft above mean
sea level (msl). Although the site is presently adjacent to its northern bank, the West Fork of the
Trinity River was considerably more sinuous before it was artificially channelized for flood control
purposes in the mid-twentieth century, and site 41TR203 was probably previously situated between
50 to 100 m southeast of the channel according to historic map data (Foster et al. 2006). The
underlying geology of the site is mapped as Holocene alluvium (Fisher 1972), while the soil is Frio
silty clay, 0-1 percent slopes, which formed within loamy and clayey calcareous alluvium (Ressel
1981). Frio soils have a high potential to contain both shallow and deeply buried archeological
components (Abbott 2011).
2.2

Environmental Setting

The site lies within the Grand Prairie ecological region, where the terrain is an undulating plain
generally underlain by Lower Cretaceous limestones with interbedded marl and clay (Griffith et
al. 2004) (Figure 2.1). The vegetation of the Grand Prairie is similar to the Northern Blackland
Prairie; however, the limestone of the Grand Prairie is relatively more resistant to weathering, yet
meandering streams deeply incise its limestone surface. This habitat historically supported a rich
mixture of diverse plant and animal communities available to the prehistoric peoples of northcentral Texas. Grand Prairie grasses include big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, little bluestem, hairy
grama, Texas wintergrass, sideoats grama, and Texas cupgrass. The original vegetation was
tallgrass prairie in the upland areas and elm, pecan, and hackberry in riparian areas where deeper
soils have developed in floodplain deposits or where the underlying clays have been exposed by
limestone erosion. Invasive species such as Ashe juniper and honey mesquite have increased with
settlement and increasing urbanization (Griffith et al. 2004). Most of the prairie has been converted
to cropland (e.g., corn, grain sorghum, and wheat), non-native pasture, and expanding urban uses
around Fort Worth.

Site 41TR203 is within the Texan Biotic Province that occupies an intermediate location between
the grasslands of the Southern Plains to the west and the deciduous forests of the Southeast
(Blair 1950). A total of 49 species of mammals occur in the region, including white-tailed deer,
bison, bear, squirrel, rabbit, and raccoon, along with a wide range of bird species and aquatic fauna
such as turtle, snake, frog, fish, and freshwater mussel.
Tarrant County has a subtropical climate with hot, humid summers and mild winters, except for
short-lived periods of colder weather. The region receives sunshine about 76 percent of the time.
Temperatures fall to or below an average of 20Â°F about six days per year. Only 7.4 cm (2.9 in) of
precipitation fall on average as snow, with frozen precipitation occurring in three of four years.
Hailstorms typically occur two or three days a year. A wide range of annual temperature extremes
characterizes the region. In Tarrant County, the records for daily extremes reflect a low of -8Â°F in
February 1899, and a high of 113Â°F in June 1980. Typically, temperatures average 47.4Â°F in the
winter season (December to February) and 83.3Â°F in the summer season (June to August)
(Ressel 1981: Table 2). The region has an average annual precipitation of 81.5 cm (32.1 in), with
more than a quarter of it occurring during April and May. About 60 percent of the yearly
precipitation falls from April through September, usually at night, with an average of about 44
rainfall events a year. The maximum recorded one-day rainfall amount was 24.3 cm (9.57 in),
which fell in 1932. The prevailing winds are usually from the south, and the highest speeds reach
22.5 km (14 mi) per hour in March and April.
2.3

Paleoenvironment

Archeologists are interested in how environments and site settings have changed through time,
because observations about current climatic conditions cannot be assumed to apply to the past.
Climates and geological processes have literally shaped archeological deposits, and they provide
insight about both specific subsistence resources available at a given time period and the uneven
preservation of the archeological record. Walter Taylor (1967:184â187) may have been among the
first in 1948 to call for the collection of environmental data by archeologists using the Conjunctive
Approach, but by the late 1960s, such practice was entrenched within the New Archeology
paradigm. Today many universities concentrate their anthropological graduate programs on the
complex relationships between people and the environment. Concurrent with Taylorâs directive, the
fossil pollen record in Texas was being assembled as early as the 1940s by J. E. Potzger and B. C.
Mercado Site (41TR203)

17

Tharp (1943, 1947, 1954) using a series of peat deposits. Their early attempts were informative, as
fossil pollen grains can be more reliable paleoenvironmental indicators than any archeological or
paleontological data, but early studies like those by Potzger and Tharp lacked chronological control
(Bryant and Holloway 1985:40).
Site 41TR203 is within the narrow Grand Prairie physiographic area of the Cross Timbers (Griffith
et al. 2004), which is sandwiched between the North-Central Plains and the Blackland Prairies
(BEG 1996) (Figure 2.2). Alluvial sediments from north Texas generally do not contain preserved
pollen in quantities sufficient for the reconstruction of valid paleoenvironmental studies (Bryant
and Holloway 1985:66). For this reason, peat bogs in Oklahoma and central Texas have become
proxies for fossil pollen evidence providing insight about the north Texas paleoenvironment (see
Figure 2.1).
The reconstruction of paleoenvironmental conditions at site 41TR203 involved multiple lines of
evidence used to infer past conditions, including stable carbon isotopes, sedimentation rates
informed by radiocarbon assays, faunal analysis, and mussel shell artifacts. These proxy data were
chosen, because they have a specific relationship to the nature of the past environment and the
potential to accurately reflect environmental conditions that prevailed at the time in which they
were preserved at site 41TR203. Following Caran (1998: Table 4), a geoarcheological study (see
Chapter 6) using stable carbon isotope analysis and radiocarbon assays was used to establish
adequate stratigraphic, contextual, and chronological controls. Faunal preservation was exceptional
at the site, allowing these data to be added to the model. Finally, isotope ratio data from the mussel
shell analysis provided another climatic indicator for the site. These multiple lines of evidence are
then compared to the paleoenvironmental sequences determined by the fossil pollen record. The
following discussion of fossil pollen evidence is generally limited to the Late Holocene time frame
preserved at site 41TR203, as determined by radiocarbon assays (3390 to 590 yr Cal BP).

Fossil Pollen Evidence

Lois E. Albert (1981) analyzed peat core samples from Ferndale Bog in Atoka County, Oklahoma
(about 160 miles northwest of site 41TR203) (see Figure 2.1). Her study revealed that from
approximately 5000 yr Cal BP until 1700 yr Cal BP the fossil pollen record is dominated by high
percentages of grass and herbaceous pollen with some Quercus (oak) and Carya (hickory) pollen
present (Albert 1981:v; Bryant and Holloway 1985:64). During those 3,300 years, minor
fluctuations in pollen types were evident, but overall stability was indicated. By 1700 yr Cal BP
there was an increase in Pinus (pine) pollen, signaling the migration of pine into the region,
according to Albert (1981:v). Holloway (1993) conducted further studies at Ferndale Bog that
situated the beginning of the pine migration at 2100yr Cal BP and the establishment of an oakhickory-pine forest after 1200 yr Cal BP (Bryant and Holloway 1985:64). Holloway (1993) found
that the percentage of pine pollen remained moderate and stable during the 900-year interval before
increasing dramatically after 1200 yr Cal BP, although pine pollen never exceeded 30 percent.
Both studies agree that an initial post-glacial (10,000 yr Cal BP) grassland vegetation was replaced
first by an oak savanna, followed by an oak woodland (5000 yr Cal BP), and finally by a migration
of pine that peaks about 1200 yr Cal BP.
The earliest study of the central Texas paleoenvironmental record was conducted at Patschke Bog
(Potzger and Tharp 1943) (Figure 2.1). The post-glacial period (last 10,000 years) in central Texas
was characterized as a time of gradual warming and drying with a predominant savanna of grasses
and some oak and hickory trees. All of the central Texas peat bog studies reflect overall declines in
arboreal pollen besides oak and concurrent increases in herbaceous and grass pollen (Bryant and
Holloway 1985:61). Bryant (1977) studied the Gause Bog and the Boriak Bog (see Figure 2.1) and
concluded that the establishment of the present oak-savanna vegetation probably occurred no later
than 3000 yr Cal BP, and the vegetation has remained stable since then. Holloway et al. (1987)
push this occurrence to 1500 yr Cal BP (Bryant and Holloway 1985:62). The discrepancy may be a
function of the incomplete fossil pollen record at any one location. The upper 3 to 4 m of Gause
Bog were removed for commercial purposes in the 1940s at the same time that the Boriak Bog was
partially drained and suffered an uncontrolled burn. The uppermost radiocarbon date at Boriak Bog
was 3400 yr Cal BP, suggesting that the last several thousand years of deposition is missing.
Conversely, the Weakly Bog (150 miles southeast of site 41TR203) (see Figure 2.1) spans the last
2,400 years. Pollen data from the Weakly Bog suggest that from 2400 to 1500 yr Cal BP, central
Mercado Site (41TR203)

20

July 2019

Texas vegetation probably consisted of open woodland dominated by oaks with some open
grassland areas. Around 1500 yr Cal BP, the present oak-savanna vegetation established itself,
replacing the oak woodland. Thus, a prolonged period of drier and warmer climatic conditions
existed in central Texas after 1500 yr Cal BP according to this fossil pollen record (Bryant and
Holloway 1985:62; Holloway et al. 1987).
2.5

Cultural Chronology

The following overview of prehistoric north-central Texas is derived mainly from Daniel J.
Prikrylâs (1990, 1993) investigations throughout north and northeast Texas, Dee Ann Story et alâs
(1990) synthesis of upper Trinity River basin archeological data, Mark J. Lynottâs (1981) work in
the Cross Timbers and Blackland Prairie of north Texas, and Jack L. Hofmanâs (1989) summary of
southern Great Plains archeology. Reservoir development in north Texas targeted the Trinity River
drainages, resulting in numerous archeological investigations prior to their inundation. Several
large projects took place along the Trinity Riverâs East Fork at Lake Lavon and Lake Ray Hubbard,
contributing significant knowledge about the regionâs prehistory (THC 2018), as has a recent data
recovery project at site 41DL203 (Tinsley and Dayton 2011). Investigations along other parts of the
Trinity River basin have involved the upper Elm Fork of the Trinity River in the Denton area,
including Ray Roberts Reservoir, Lewisville Lake, and Grapevine Lake (Ferring and Yates 1997;
THC 2018). Large-scale research along the West Fork of the Trinity River has been primarily
limited to Mountain Creek Lake (THC 2018), although a recent data recovery project was
conducted at 41DL436 prior to a transportation undertaking on a tributary of the West Fork of the
Trinity River (Nickels 2014). The following cultural chronology is tailored to the time frame
represented at 41TR203, as determined by radiocarbon assays (3390 to 590 yr cal BP), and focuses
on the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods.
2.5.1

Archaic Period (8500-1250 yr Cal BP)

The Archaic period in north-central Texas extended from approximately 8500 to 1250 yr Cal BP
with three subdivisions, including early (8500â6000 yr Cal BP), middle (6000â3500 yr Cal BP),
and late (3500 to 1250 yr Cal BP), distinguished mainly by projectile point types, inferred climate
changes, and shifting subsistence strategies (Prikryl 1990). Based on the definition of analytical
units at site 41TR203, a Late/Transitional Archaic Period for the West Fork of the Trinity River is
proposed (1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP), overlapping the early Late Prehistoric period.
Mercado Site (41TR203)

21

July 2019

Diagnostic artifacts associated with the Early Archaic consist of splitstem varieties, while the
Middle Archaic is represented by basal-notched types such as Bell, Andice, Carrollton, and
Bulverde. Late Archaic dart points include the Castroville, Marshall, Edgewood, Elam, Trinity, and
Gary types (Prikryl 1990). Most of these projectile points were recovered on the surface and their
ages determined by similar artifacts dated in other neighboring regions.
Based on the dearth of discrete or stratigraphic Archaic occupations that have been analyzed in the
region, north-central Texas archeology did not warrant its own chapter in The Prehistory of Texas
(Perttula 2004), an otherwise comprehensive volume. Generally, the Archaic record likely reflects
a slowly increasing population that had to respond to warmer and drier climatic conditions
(Lynott 1981). As such, Archaic groups in the Grand Prairies region probably developed
diversified hunting and gathering patterns focused on bottomland resources of rivers and major
creeks (Hofman 1989). The Calvert Site in the Trinity Valley of Denton Creek (41DN103) (Ferring
and Yates 1997) yielded a burial, hearths, and an unmixed Middle Archaic assemblage of artifacts
and fauna. Investigators at the site suggested that the climate may have been drier, and that the
homogeneity of artifact types with adjacent regions might indicate that Middle Archaic groups
participated in broader cultural interactions (Ferring and Yates 1997:305).
Two Late Archaic occupations at Mountain Creek Lake and Ray Roberts Reservoir are
characterized by repeated occupations by small groups. In north-central Texas, the Late Archaic
(and subsequent Late Prehistoric) archeological record commonly describes human burials, several
of which are associated with Wylie pit features along the East Fork Trinity River (Stephenson
1952). These pit features became a hallmark of the Late Prehistoric Wylie focus. Investigations at
the Richland-Chambers Reservoir indicated that the Wylie pit feature extended back to the Late
Archaic and functioned as large-scale food processing sites, analogous to burned rock midden
features in central Texas. The burials and pit features suggest larger groups came together
seasonally for large-scale processing of food resources during the Late Archaic and extending into
the Late Prehistoric.
Other sites along the upper Elm Fork of the Trinity River that are suitable for comparative analysis
with the Archaic component of site 41TR203 include 41CO144 (Jayrn site) and 41CO150 (Gemma
site), which were both excavated within chute cut-off channels (Ferring and Yates 1997). Rapid
channel filling preserved discrete occupation surfaces with features and charcoal that were

separated by sterile alluvium. Site 41CO150 has one of the best series of stratified Late Archaic
occupations in the region (Ferring and Yates 1997).
2.5.2

Late/Transitional Archaic Period (1815-1415 yr Cal BP)

Based on the definition of Analytical Units 4 and 5 at site 41TR203, a Late/Transitional Archaic
Period for the West Fork of the Trinity River is proposed (1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP), overlapping
the early Late Prehistoric period. The two periods are intentionally left intertwined in this
chronology, similar to the transitional period between the Archaic and Late Prehistoric Periods in
Central Texas (Johnson and Goode 1994; Carpenter et al. 2013). Johnson and Goode (1994) place
the end of the Archaic Period on the Eastern Edwards Plateau at about 1400 yr Cal BP, but they are
open to the possibility that Archaic lifeways continued to about 800 yr Cal BP. Although not a
focus of the research design, the Late/Transitional Archaic Period at site 41TR203 is proposed
based on the analysis of radiocarbon assays from Features 14, 21, and 26 (Betas 396617, 396618,
396629, 396635, and 396636). This series of Late/Transitional Archaic prehistoric occupations is
recorded at the lower contact of the West Fork Soil transitioning into the Lower Pilot Point
Alloformation in the terrace setting. More discussion of the Late/Transitional Archaic concept is
provided in the Chapter 10 synthesis; however, it is constrained by a lack of diagnostic lithic tools
from Features 14, 21, and 26, and instead focuses on subsistence evidence.
2.5.3

Late Prehistoric Period (1250-250 yr Cal BP)

Prikryl (1993) divides the Late Prehistoric period into Late Prehistoric I (1250 to 750 yr Cal BP)
and Late Prehistoric II (750 to 250 yr Cal BP) based on projectile point and ceramic types. Late
Prehistoric I temporally diagnostic arrow points include Scallorn, Catahoula, Steiner, Alba, and
Bonham. Diagnostic ceramics primarily consist of grog-tempered, undecorated varieties, although
when decorated, the influence from Caddo ceramics of East Texas is evident. During the Late
Prehistoric II, influences from southern Plains groups are apparent in the archeological record,
which may correspond to an increase in the size of the north-central Texas bison herd. Increasing
population may have limited hunting ranges and resulted in a gradual trend toward horticulture and
sedentary village life (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970).
Plains-influenced material culture (Prikryl 1990) included calcareous-tempered ceramics and
unstemmed triangular arrow points like Maud, Fresno, Harrell, Washita, and Perdiz. Also typical

Mercado Site (41TR203)

are thumbnail scrapers and two- and four-beveled knives. Hoes fashioned from bison scapula
provided evidence of horticulture from investigations at Lewisville Lake (Denton County) and
Lavon Lake (Collin County) (Barber 1969). The Henrietta complex in north-central Texas was
based on findings at the M. D. Harrell site along the Brazos River in Young County. This site and
others were often situated on sandy elevated landforms and terraces above river valleys, and
contained middens, house structures, rock hearths, storage pits, and burials (Brooks 1989).
By the 18th century, documented groups in and around the region included Tonkawa, Apache,
Comanche, Wichita, Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo (Newcomb 1961; Newcomb and
Campbell 1982). Sites attributed to this period contain European ceramics, glass beads, flintlock
musket fragments, and metal arrow points in conjunction with chipped lithic tools.

CHAPTER 3 â INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY OF 41TR202 AND NRHP
TESTING OF 41TR203

By: Julie Shipp, James W. Karbula, and Jennifer Hatchett Kimbell
aci consulting conducted an intensive pedestrian survey and NRHP testing in August 2013 under
TAC Permit 6635. The survey of site 41TR202 was conducted on the east side of I-35W on the
north bank of the West Fork of the Trinity River. The NRHP testing at site 41TR203 was
conducted on the west side of I-H35, also on the north bank. This chapter presents the data
collected from both survey and NRHP testing, which resulted in combining the two sites into
41TR203. The features excavated during NRHP testing are discussed further in the Analytical
Units and Feature Descriptions chapter (Chapter 7).
3.1
3.1.1

Field Methods
Intensive Pedestrian Survey at 41TR202

The field methods were based in part on the previous work done at sites 41TR202 and 41TR203.
Both sites were located during a coring survey conducted by Geo-Marine in 2005 (see Figure 1.4).
Eight backhoe trenches were excavated at site 41TR203 by SWCA in 2009, but no additional work
was conducted within the proposed ROW on the east side of I-35W at site 41TR202 due to access
issues. Therefore, at the beginning of the current investigation, it was unknown if the boundary of
site 41TR202 extended into the current APE within the proposed ROW on the east side of I-35W.
Thus, the field effort began by conducting the survey on the east side of I-35W to determine if
site 41TR202 was present within the APE.
Four backhoe trenches (BHTs) and one 50 by 50-cm TU were excavated within the proposed ROW
on the east side of I-35W (Figure 3.1). The trenches were placed from south to north along the
proposed ROW and were oriented north-to-south. Backhoe trenches were excavated to a width of
4 ft (1.2 m), a length of 20 ft (6.1 m), and a depth ranging from 5 to 10 ft (1.5 to 3 m). One person
was monitoring the excavation, and one person was investigating the back-dirt pile for cultural
materials. The trenches were initially dug to 4 ft (1.2 m), then investigators examined the walls for
cultural materials, drew profiles, and took photographs of the trenches.

NRHP Testing at 41TR203

NRHP testing at 41TR203 also consisted of BHT and TU excavation (see Figure 3.1). Prior to
excavation, the trenches from the intensive survey conducted by SWCA in 2009 were relocated and
flagged (see Figure 1.4). Feature 1 in BHT 2 was a burned rock feature at approximately 80 cmbs
that previous investigators had covered and reburied. This feature was relocated and excavated, and
the trench retained its designation as BHT 2. Nine additional BHTs were excavated to the north and
west to define the site boundary and within the center of the site to further understand the cultural
and natural deposits near the site centroid. Six TUs were excavated, including one (Unit 1) at
Feature 1 (F01) first located during the 2009 survey and the others at additional features.

Survey Results
Site 41TR202 Incorporated into 41TR203

Four BHTs and one 50 by 50-cm TU (Unit 6) were excavated for the intensive pedestrian survey at
site 41TR202 (see Figure 3.1). The cultural deposits in the trench profiles appeared to be similar to
those at site 41TR203, with three main occupation zones (I, II, and III) and similar artifacts, such as
burned rock, mussel shell, burned clay, and few lithics. Feature 11, a mussel shell midden, was
located within the Unit 6 in Zone II. The site was discussed with TxDOT archeologists in the field,
and it was decided to lump site 41TR202 with 41TR203, since they appeared to be the same site,
divided by I-35W.
The new site boundary likely extends from the eastern extent of the APE on the east side of I-35W.
The poisitive cores from the GeoMarine study in 2005 are approximaltey 30 m to the east of the
APE. Artifacts from site 41TR203 (formerly 41TR202) are at minumin likely to be present from
the eastern extent of the current APE on the east side of I-35 to the locations of the 2005 cores.

41TR203 NRHP Testing Results

Eleven BHTs (in addition to the four on the east side of I-H35) and seven 1 by 1-m TUs (in
addition to Unit 6 on the east side of I-35W) were placed at site 41TR203 (see Figure 3.1).
Backhoe trench and feature numbering were continued from the initial NRHP testing conducted by
SWCA. BHT 2 was re-excavated to relocate Feature 1 (F 1), which was covered and not excavated
initially. Table 3.1 summarizes the BHTs.

Features

Eight new features were located, and Feature 1 was relocated. The features consisted of hearths,
charcoal and ash concentrations, rock middens, and a shell midden. Features 1, 5, 6, and 8 were
excavated. The remaining features were covered and their locations recorded in anticipation of
future excavation.
Feature 1: Feature 1 was first observed by archeologists from SWCA during their 2009 backhoe
trenching work at site 41TR203. At that time, the archeologists photographed and documented the
feature, covered it with orange safety fencing, and backfilled the trench. aci consulting
archeologists relocated the trench based on the map of trenches provided by SWCA and used a
backhoe to carefully remove the fill from above the feature level. The feature was located at a
depth of approximately 50 cmbs and is composed of a cluster of FCR. Once the feature had been
re-exposed, archeologists from aci consulting laid out a 1 by 1-m TU (Unit 1), oriented to the
cardinal directions, centered over the feature. A vertical datum was set at 10 cm above the surface.
The unit was excavated in 10-cm levels, and all fill was screened through 1/4-inch mesh. A 10-cm
level in the eastern half of the unit outside the feature was excavated first, leaving the feature intact.
After the intact feature was documented through a sketch map and photographs, the feature was
bisected, and the upper 10 cm of the eastern half soil of the feature was removed. A portion of the
feature fill was set aside as a sample for flotation, and the rest was screened for the presence of
artifacts. This process was repeated for the second 10-cm level outside of the feature and then
inside the eastern portion of the feature. By the end of the second 10-cm level, the feature had
disappeared. The profile of the feature was not distinctive. The excavation process was repeated on
the western side of the unit, outside the feature and then inside the feature in 10-cm levels.

Feature 1 consisted of a roughly circular cluster of FCR measuring approximately 60 cm in
diameter. The northwestern corner of the TU also contained two fragments of FCR from the same
elevations as the feature and two other FCR fragments to the east of the feature which may also be
associated. The upper elevation of the cluster was approximately 50 cmbs or 60 cm below datum
(cmbd), while the lower elevation was approximately 64 cmbs. The feature comprised 20 to 25
larger cobbles and 20 to 30 small fragments. A few clumps of baked clay were found within the
feature, but the soil within the feature did not differ significantly from outside of the feature.

Photo 3.2. Feature 1 in Process of Excavation
Feature 4: Feature 4 was originally observed as a concentration of charcoal, ash, and baked soil in
the west wall of BHT 10 at approximately 84 cmbs. A 1 by 1-m TU (Unit 2) was established over
the feature, with the west wall of the BHT creating the east wall of the TU. A vertical datum was
established at 10 cm above the surface. The upper 50 cm of overburden was removed
mechanically, and hand excavation began at that level. Only the eastern half of the unit was
excavated, and the fill was screened through 1/4-inch mesh. No cultural material was recovered
from the levels above 90 cmbd. One clump of baked soil was recovered from between 90 and 100
cmbd. The fill around the feature was excavated in 5-cm levels, but no artifacts were present. The
feature measures approximately 45 cm from north to south by 25 cm from west to east. Charcoal
samples were removed for radiocarbon dating and plant identification. Excavation was terminated
at 110 cmbd, and the feature was covered with several layers of material for preservation. Further
investigation of this feature was recommended.

Feature 5: Feature 5 was initially observed in the west wall of BHT 11 as a cluster of FCR at
approximately 55 cmbs. A 1 by 1-m TU (Unit 3) was established over the feature after the upper
25 cm of overburden had been mechanically removed. A vertical datum was established at 10 cm
above the surface. Only the eastern half of the unit was excavated. The upper 30 cm of fill was
removed quickly in 10-cm levels and screened through 1/4-inch mesh, but no cultural material was
recovered. At approximately 65 cmbd (55 cmbs), the cluster of FCR was exposed. Some charcoal
and baked earth were observed in association with the FCR. Two bone fragments were also
recovered from the soil matrix between 65 and 75 cmbd. A sample of feature fill was removed for
flotation analysis. No evidence of the feature was found below 75 cmbd (65 cmbs).

Feature 6: Feature 6 was initially observed as a cluster of FCR with smears of charcoal and baked
earth in the floor of BHT 2 at approximately 115 cmbs. A 1-x-1-m TU (Unit 4) was established
over the feature, and a vertical datum was established at 10 cm above the surface. Due to space
constraints, the unit was aligned parallel to BHT 2 rather than to the cardinal directions. The crew
carefully removed matrix from around the visible FCR and then from around mussel shell, bone,
and areas of baked earth and charcoal, leaving as much cultural material in place as was possible.
Matrix was screened through 1/4-inch mesh, and all cultural material found in the screen was
collected. Between 122 and 130 cmbd, 41 individual articles were mapped and collected as pointplotted items. Mapped materials included FCR, mussel shell, bone fragments, baked earth, and
charcoal. The bone fragments recovered were relatively fragile and tended to break apart easily
during excavation. At 130 cmbd, very few artifacts were still present in the unit, and no artifacts
were present below 134 cmbd.
The feature extent, which was difficult to determine when the excavation unit was established,
proved to encompass the northwest, northeast, and southeast quadrants of the excavation unit; very
little material was present in the southwest quadrant. The feature appeared to represent a discard
pile of food remains and cooking debris (FCR, ash, and charcoal). The FCR did not appear to
reflect the kind of pattern that would be expected of a hearth or oven feature.

Feature 7: BHT 10 was expanded in order to determine whether additional features similar to
Feature 4 might exist nearby. The presence of one or more similar features in the immediate
vicinity of Feature 4 would support the hypothesis that Feature 4 represented a structural support
post. The backhoe was used to remove overburden to the east of Feature 4, and at approximately 90
cmbs, just over 2 m east of Feature 4, three amorphous clusters of charcoal were exposed. The
largest of the three charcoal clusters was roughly circular in outline, measured approximately 9 cm
in diameter, and was labeled as Feature 7. A sample of charcoal from this cluster was removed for
radiocarbon dating. No other cultural material was observed in association with Feature 7, but the
charcoal clusters may indicate the presence of the remains of one or more posts. The feature was
covered with several layers of material before the trench was backfilled. Further investigation of
Feature 7 was recommended.

clusters of charcoal that were not labeled as features.

Feature 8: Feature 8 was originally observed as a lens of FCR and mussel shell in the east wall of
BHT 2 at approximately 20 to 30 cmbs, immediately below the plow zone. A 1 by 1-m TU (Unit 7)
was established to the east of BHT 2, and the same vertical datum used for Unit 1 was also used for
Unit 7. The feature consisted of a cluster of FCR with small amounts of charcoal and baked earth.
Several mammal bone fragments were also present within the FCR cluster. The feature appears to
be limited to a lens between approximately 34 and 45 cmbd. A flotation sample of feature fill was
taken from each 10-cm excavation level, and samples were also taken of the soil from outside the
feature. Just west of the FCR cluster and at a slightly lower elevation, were several fragments of
animal bone. Fifty-six cmbs below the animal bone, the soil matrix was devoid of cultural material.
This feature may represent a small hearth with a collection of discarded animal bones nearby, or it
may represent an area where both FCR and animal bones were discarded.

Feature 9: Feature 9 was located in the east wall of BHT 14. The feature consisted of burned clay
and charcoal in the east wall of the trench. It was noted that the feature was similar to Feature 4,
which is possibly a burned post or tree root. Both features were vertical in orientation and consisted
primarily of burned earth and charcoal. The charcoal within Feature 9 was not as substantial as the
pieces from Feature 4. Feature 9 was also shallower, ranging in depth from 40 to 70 cmbs.
Feature 9 was not excavated. The feature was covered and reburied. A small sample of the feature
was collected in the event that we chose to date the charcoal or float the sample. Those samples
were not analyzed.

Feature 10: Feature 10 was located in the walls and floor of the northern end of BHT 16. A dense
concentration of burned rock was noted in both walls and the floor of the trench. The feature was at
a depth of 20 to 50 cmbs and was still present in the floor when trenching was ceased. The density
of rocks suggests that this feature may be a burned rock midden. The feature was covered and and
protected for excavation during data recovery phase when an excavation block was placed at the
north end of the trench.

Feature 11: Feature 11 is a mussel shell midden that was located in one of four trenches excavated
on the east side of the highway, in BHT 19. The feature was originally noted as about five pieces of
burned rock in the east wall of the trench, at approximately 60 cmbs. A 50-cm TU (Unit 6) was
situated over the rocks and was excavated from the surface. A mussel shell midden was then
located over the burned rock at approximately 45 cmbs. The shells were concentrated in the
southeast corner of the TU, but the material was present throughout the 50-cm test. The feature did
not appear to extend into the trench and was not present in the west wall of the trench. Feature 11
was covered for future excavation. An excavation block was intended to be placed to extend from
the east wall of the trench to excavate the feature, but that block was never excavated, thus neither
was Feature 11.

Geoarcheology

Three broad cultural components were located at site 41TR203, which now encompasses the APE
on both sides of the highway. The component at 270 to 300 cmbs that was reported from the
expedited survey was not relocated during the current investigation. However, a shallower
component, which was mostly still intact below the plow zone, was located. The three cultural
Mercado Site (41TR203)

44

July 2019

components were located at depths of approximately 25 to 45 cmbs, 60 to 80 cmbs, and 100 to
120 cmbs.
A column sample was collected from the BHT 12 wall adjacent to Feature 6, Unit 4, and the
physical properties were analyzed. The magnetic susceptibility and particle-size analyses were
most indicative of potential discrete cultural occupations and the formation of a paleosol at the
bottom of the profile. The magnetic susceptibility peaked at several places, namely just under the
plow zone and again at the bottom of the profile (Figure 3.2).
The particle-size analysis correlated more closely to the assertion of an upper, middle, and lower
component; although, the textual variation is fairly minimal and indicative of a clayey alluvial
flood plain. Peaks in the coarser textures are also indicative of discrete flood events that would
bury and preserve archeology components (Figure 3.3).

Radiocarbon Dates

A total of 13 radiocarbon dates were obtained from the survey and testing at the site, including four
from the 2005 survey, six from the intensive survey conducted in 2009, and three from the NRHP
testing (Table 3.2) (also see Appendix A). The dates are generally positioned in correct
stratigraphic order from the Late Archaic period to the Late Prehistoric Period. However, some of
the dates are out of sequence. This is due in large part to the material types tested. The sediment
samples are less precise than the charcoal samples and date to older periods that the charcoal
samples from the same period.

Botanical Remains

Seven flotation samples and one radiocarbon sample were submitted to Dr. Leslie Bush for
macrobotanical analysis (see Appendix B). The flotation samples represent 20.65 cubic decimeters
of soil matrix from six excavation units and Features 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8. All the carbonized samples
were wood charcoal, 45 of which could be identified to genus or species. The trees identified were
primarily box elder and cedar elm, which are typical floodplain species. The botanical study, while
lacking in remains directly related to diet, such as charred seeds or bulbs, illustrated that wood
charcoal was abundant and identifiable at the site. Further analysis of wood charcoal at the site
would contribute to the identification of fuel types and potentially indicated changes in vegetation
types, and thus climate and seasonality.
3.3.5

Faunal Remains

All the animal bones collected during the NRHP testing of site 41TR203 were analyzed by Dr. Jodi
Jacobson (see Appendix C). The majority of the 1,073 vertebrate bones that were analyzed were
mammal, ranging from large to small, and including bison, horse, deer, antelope, pig, dog, raccoon,

rabbit, prairie dog, possum, rat, and vole. The specimens were analyzed for human modification,
post-depositional alterations, and age and sex of the animal. Four cut marks and one chop mark
were observed, and 53 of them appear to have been burned. Evidence of post-depositional
alterations include carnivore gnawing on five of the bones and varying degrees of weathering.
The preservation of the faunal material was good and the remains identifiable. The presence and
availability of bison and antelope are still relatively unknown in north Texas. The Fish Creek
Slough site (41DL436) (see Figure 2.1) would potentially provide a nice comparison site for
site 41TR203 in these regards. In addition, the presence of white-tailed deer could provide data on
paleoenvironment. And finally, there is substance data concerning cooking techniques that could be
derived from breakage patterns on the bones. In general, the faunal material is well-preserved and
maintains a high potential to contribute to research questions regarding available resources,
cooking techniques, climate, and seasonality (see Appendix C).

Recommendations
Archeological Site Evaluations

As federal funding is involved with the proposed Project, under the Section 106 process of the
NHPA, federal agencies are required to consider the impact of a project on historic properties that
are included in or eligible for the NRHP. The regulations for administering the Section 106 process
are contained in 36 CFR Part 800 â The Protection of Historic Properties.
Under the Programmatic Agreement (PA) between the FHWA, the Texas State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO), the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and TxDOT,
TxDOT has identified, initiated, and continued consultation with interested parties which includes
Native American Tribes with interests in the region (36 CFR 800.1â3)
Site 41TR203 was initially identified by Galindo and Lawrence (2009) as an archeological historic
property potentially eligible for listing in the NRHP (36 CFR 800.4) under Criterion D.
Investigators also found that the site was also eligible for SAL designation. The current
investigation also recommends site 41TR203 as eligible for listing in the NRHP and for SAL
designation. The NRHP nominating and evaluation criteria are listed in 36 CFR 60.4. An

archeological site must possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, and association, and:
A. That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
B. That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C. That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or
that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D. That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.
Site 41TR203 is potentially eligible for listing under Criterion D of the evaluation criteria.
Criterion D refers to the potential of a site to ââ¦have yielded, or may be likely to yield,
information important in prehistory or history.â Critical to a site being able to provide information,
and therefore, fulfill the requirement of Criterion D is the physical preservation and integrity of
place of deposits and material.
The investigations at site 41TR203 encountered deposits consisting of bone, mussel shell, FCR,
and charcoal within three occupation zones. The organic material had a high degree of
preservation. Radiocarbon dates that were obtained from the original intensive surveys and NRHP
testing show that these occupations occurred during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods
(see Appendix A). This site has the potential to address research questions regarding changes in
subsistence strategies from the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods in north-central Texas,
particularly on sites along the West Fork of the Trinity River.
The site would also qualify as a SAL according to the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the
Antiquities Code of Texas (TAC, Title 13, Chapter 26), as the property is situated on state-owned
property. Furthermore, the site may qualify for formal designation as a SAL under 13 TAC 26.10
(subpart A(1). Similar to the NRHP evaluation criteria, the Texas Antiquities Committee uses one
or more of the following criteria when assessing the appropriateness of official landmark
designation, and/or the need for further investigations under the permit process:
1. The site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or
history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
Mercado Site (41TR203)

49

July 2019

2. The siteâs archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. The site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
4. The study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; and/or
5. The high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to insure maximum legal protection, or alternatively
further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting
when the site cannot be protected.
The site has potential to qualify under Criterion (1), as the site has potential to provide significant
information about prehistoric subsistence and paleoenvironment. The site has potential to qualify
under Criteria (2) and (3) for stratified alluvial deposits that have potential to contain preserved and
intact cultural material, and the observed high degree of faunal preservation is rare at most Texas
archeological sites, respectively. In addition, the site has potential to qualify under Criterion (4), as
the site has potential to investigate theories on subsistence, resource procurement, and possibly
intrasite patterning.
Based on the fieldwork and analysis conducted, site 41TR203 was recommended as eligible for
listing in the NRHP and formal designation as a SAL. aci consulting proposed that the ROW
contains an archeological historic property (36 CFR 800.16(l)(2)). Therefore, the proposed
undertaking would have an adverse effect on archeological historic properties (pursuant to
Stipulation VII of the First Amended PA among the FHWA, TxDOT, Texas SHPO, and ACHP
Regarding the Implementation of Transportation Undertakings [PA-TU]). The Project merited data
recovery investigations in compliance with the Memorandum of Understanding ([MOU] 43 TAC
2.24(f)(4)(A)) between TxDOT and the THC. Data recovery excavations at site 41TR203
commenced the following winter.

CHAPTER 4 â RESEARCH DESIGN

By: Julie Shipp
The Mercado site (41TR203) was determined to be NRHP and SAL eligible because of its potential
contribution to north-central Texas archeology. In particular, site 41TR203 is significant in that
there are discrete, well-preserved Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric components within the top 1.5
m of alluvium on the West Fork of the Trinity River. Few sites of this type have been excavated;
thus, the site provides the opportunity to investigate these periods within the Upper Trinity River
Basin, and how subsistence strategies may have changed throughout the Late Archaic to Late
Prehistoric periods.
The data recovery excavations conducted in February, March, and June of 2014, confirmed the
contextual integrity of the site, and the amount and types of data collected provide for a productive
data recovery investigation. After fieldwork was completed, geoarcheological investigations were
conducted (see Chapter 6), 39 radiocarbon dates were obtained (see Appendix A), and the AUs for
the investigation were defined.
4.1

Analytical Units

The AUs are comprised of the four main occupations identified through peaks in microartifacts (B,
E, G, and L), with the addition of five of the ephemeral occupations (C, D, J, K, and M) for which
there is excavation data. However, this makes for eight AUs rather than nine, because
Occupations B and D were combined to create AU 1, and Occupations K and L were combined to
create AU 6 in Block C. Occupation J stands on its own as AU 5. In addition, Occupation E was
split into two separate AUs due to the discrepancy in radiocarbon dates and depths below datum.
The AUs are numbered 1 through 8 from the top to bottom of the profile (Table 4.1). Chapter 7
outlines the occupations and the depths of the AUs.

The manifestation of AUs differs in each block. Not all AUs are present within each block, and the
thickness varies between blocks. This is in part due to the exercise of creating AUs that match the
excavation data, while also correlating with the occupations derived from the geoarcheological data
and, in most cases, increasing the width of those occupations. The variation between AUs in
different blocks is also due to the horizontal expression of the site, such as the topography at the
time of occupation and the location of activity areas.
The cultural data recovered from each AU further defines the nature of each unit. The AUs are
evaluated in relation to the excavation zones, in that they date to three primarily different periods
throughout the occupations of the Late Holocene. The cultural features and artifact types that are
present within each AU reflect apparent changes through time in subsistence strategies and
possibly the intensity or duration of the occupations. AUs 1 through 3 date to the Late Prehistoric
period, with a radiocarbon date range of 1530 to 930 yr Cal BP. AU 1 contained a burned rock
midden. AU 2 contained a simple hearth feature. AU 3 is characterized by small hearth features
and faunal material. AUs 4 and 5 are radiocarbon dated to an apparent Late/Transitional Archaic
period (1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP) that is characterized by mussel shell middens and few other
artifacts. AUs 6 through 8 are Late Archaic occupations (2760 to 2145 yr Cal BP), and this lower
portion of the site is composed of a sheet midden with abundant mussel shell, burned rock, lithics,
burned clay, and faunal material, including bison.

Research Design

The site provides the opportunity to investigate settlement patterns and subsistence strategies
within the Upper Trinity River basin in north-central Texas and how those strategies may have
changed throughout the Late Archaic period. The research questions were approached from a
Historical Ecological perspective. Historical Ecology is a general theoretical framework that
focuses on human relationships with a particular environment over the long term and considers the
landscape as a part of human ecology. This approach provides a practical context in which to
combine archeology with ecological studies and allows for humans to both affect and be affected
by ecology rather than simply being set into the backdrop of a static environment (BalÃ©e 1998;
Crumley 1994a, 1994b).
The Historical Ecological approach is well-suited for the study of hunter-gatherer behavior at
site 41TR203, because it relies on the subsistence data. The primary archeological assemblages
from the site are faunal remains and FCR; only a handful of lithic artifacts have been recovered.
However, the botanical remains extracted from the soil are also an important contribution to a
balanced perspective on the broad-spectrum diet and subsistence strategies employed by Late
Archaic hunter-gatherers in the Upper Trinity River Valley (Ferring and Yates 1997).
The Historical Ecology approach is also relevant because of the repeated occupations of the site.
The late Holocene landscape was evolving from both natural and cultural processes during these
episodic occupations by humans. The ecology of the site certainly changed over the course of the
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, and data from site 41TR203 suggest a Late/Transitional
Archaic period in the region, which remains poorly defined.
This Research Design includes the five main topics of 1) Paleoenvironment; 2) Regional
Chronology; 3) Subsistence Strategies; 4) Lithic Technology; and 5) Geoarcheological Analysis of
Burned Earth. Each topic heading contains completed analyses and research questions that were
addressed.

4.2.1.1

Research Topics
Paleoenvironment

The Late Archaic period is marked by numerous fluctuations in climate (Abbott 2011; Ferring and
Yates 1997). Human adaptations are often related to creating stability in an unpredictable and
suddenly changing climate (Butzer 1982; Rosen 2007), and a significant amount of climate data
has been compiled for the Late Holocene in north-central Texas (Ferring 1994; Ferring and Yates
1997). However, much work remains to be done in Texas to create linkages between climate and
the availability of resources for prehistoric peoples and the subtle variability with which these
relationships changed temporally and spatially (Abbott 2011).
The climate data from site 41TR203 assist in refining our understanding of the nature of the
climate from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods, which also provided information
about the seasonal use of the site and insight into the continued use of the site during this time,
including the apparent periods of abandonment between occupations.
Stable Carbon Isotopes
Stable carbon isotopes analysis is an invaluable tool for which to measure changes and identify
patterns in environmental fluctuations. There are a few other sites in the Upper Trinity River
Valley where stable carbon isotopes have been reviewed, but most of these studies are incomplete
compared to the profile at site 41TR203. The existing data from these sites do, however, reflect a
climate shift around the same time, despite some variations (see Chapter 6). Additional
paleoclimate work remains to be done in order to help refine the climate shift in the region during
the Late Archaic period. Site 41TR203 was a good candidate for this due to the wide chronological
range in sample dates and good preservation at the site. Stable carbon isotope research questions
include the following:
1. Were there any major climate shifts that occurred near the end of the Late Archaic?
2. What is the pattern of shifting C3 and C4 faunal and floral specimens? Does the pattern
correlate with the AUs at the site?
3. Do the climate shifts and C3/C4 patterns at site 41TR203 correlate to other contemporary
sites in the region?

Sedimentation Rates
Frederick and McKee (see Chapter 6) used 33 radiocarbon dates from both feature contexts and
microartifact samples in each of the blocks (A through C) at site 41TR203 to produce a composite
age-depth model that reflects the sedimentation rate. Models for each profile were produced by
using radiocarbon ages that were calibrated according to a published radiocarbon calibration curve,
standard deviations, and depth measurements. The age-depth models were calculated, making the
sole assumption in each case that the sediments were deposited with the oldest deposits at the
bottom and youngest at the top. The 95 percent confidence interval (CI) of the age-depth model and
the probability distributions of each sampled date were then plotted and an image file created (see
Chapter 6: Figure 6.12). This method allowed for the sedimentation rates of each of the profiles to
be compared. Research Design questions included:
1. Do sedimentation rates correlate with occupations?
2. Does the sedimentation at the site reflect a steady deposition, or were there variations in
flood plain aggradation rates?
3. What is the relationship between the paleosol and AUs 6 through 8? Did the slower
sedimentation during this period affect the context of the cultural material, and to what
degree?
4. Are the variations in sedimentation rates attributed to rainfall, channel migration, channel
incision, or a combination of these factors?
5. What are the post-depositional disturbances?
6. Do sedimentation rates correlate with the other environmental data?
Faunal Analysis
Faunal bone preservation at site 41TR203 is considered exceptional because out of 8,346 vertebrate
specimens, 7,265 (87%) were identifiable to class (see Chapter 8). Even so, the vertebrate remains
at the site lack the diversity to provide detailed data on fluctuating climate. However, there is a
clear distinction in the assemblages from the upper and lower portions of the site, which reflect a
change in C3 and C4 environments. In addition, bison are only present in the lower portion of the
site. Some questions regarding paleoenvironment that the faunal assemblage can address are:

Mercado Site (41TR203)

56

July 2019

1. What are the differences between the faunal assemblages from the upper portion (AUs 1
through 5) and the lower portion (AUs 6 through 8) of the site?
2. Do the changes in faunal assemblages indicate changes in C3 and C4 plants?
3. What are the results of the stable carbon isotope analysis on the rabbit specimens? Do they
correlate to the other isotope subsets?
Mussel Shell
Mussel shell is an excellent proxy indicator of paleoenvironmental factors. Species identification of
mussel shell can reveal where habitat shell was harvested from, i.e., the nature of the local water
source. The stable carbon isotope analysis on the mussel shell provides data regarding the
environmental changes at the site during the eight described occupations. Environmental data from
the mussel shell should help to address such questions as:
1. What are the changes in temperature and rainfall in AUs 1 through 8?
2. What is the nature of the river over the course of the siteâs occupations?
3. Do the shifts in mussel species correlate with changes in C3 and C4 plants?
4.2.1.2

Regional Chronology

The Mercado site is located in the Upper Trinity River Basin, which begins at the northern end of
the Trinity basin, from the headwaters of the four branches of the Trinity River, the Clear Fork, the
West Fork, the Elm Fork, and the East Fork, down to the southern end of Dallas County.
Significant comparable sites within the Upper Trinity River Basin that contain Late Archaic
components were identified, and the archeological assemblages compared with those at 41TR203
in an attempt to further refine the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods in north-central Texas.
The goal is to compare the Mercado site with the other sites in relation to research topics of
paleoenvironment, subsistence strategies, and geoarcheological burned earth analysis.
Radiocarbon Dating
In order to compare site 41TR203 with other Late Archaic sites in the Upper Trinity River Basin,
additional radiocarbon samples were collected from all features and from within all defined cultural
zones to refine the chronology at the site (see Appendix A). Radiocarbon dating is especially

Mercado Site (41TR203)

57

July 2019

important given the paucity of diagnostic artifacts recovered from the site. Research questions
regarding radiocarbon dating included:
1. What are the date ranges for the AUs?
2. Do these ranges match other sites in the region for Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
occupations?
3. Are there date ranges in the AUs for cultural periods that have not been previously defined?
4.2.1.3

Subsistence Strategies

Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups returned to site 41TR203 to procure and
process resources for more than 1,500 years. However, while it is clear these activities were taking
place, the resources that were being exploited and the way they were processed may have shifted
according to seasonality, climate, or as a result of human adaptation in the form of technological
innovations that occurred throughout the siteâs occupational history. Considering how subsistence
strategies shifted or remained static at site 41TR203 over time has the potential to provide
important insight into the lives of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric peoples living in north-central
Texas.
Previously recorded sites located along the West Fork of the Trinity River do not typically contain
many lithic artifacts, and this is the case at site 41TR203. However, in the absence of large
quantities of lithic artifacts, data pertaining to subsistence strategies can be ascertained through
other methods of analysis, particularly through the analysis of floral and faunal remains. Floral and
faunal remains, both of which are found at macro and micro scales at site 41TR203, were used to
identify what resources were procured and processed at the site over time. Additionally, the
excavation and analysis of burned rock cooking features provided information about how these
resources were being processed.
1. What were the resource opportunities at the site in addition to mussel shell and hardwood?
2. Did the available resources differ between occupations?
3. During what seasons was the site inhabited?
4. Did the seasonality change from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric?

Faunal Analysis
Faunal remains were the most abundant artifacts recovered at the site. Of these, the diversity was
limited with a predominance of bison and deer in AUs 6 through 8. The recovery of bison remains
at site 41TR203 is interesting given that, to date, the degree to which bison was a part of the Late
Archaic peopleâs subsistence strategy in this region of north-central Texas is not yet well defined
(Peter and Harrison 2011). Excavations at site 41DL203 identified bison remains in scant quantities
within all observed Late Archaic components; however, at site 41TR198, located approximately
3.4 km (2.1 mi) downstream from site 41TR203, no bison remains were identified within the Late
Archaic assemblage (Peter and Harrison 2011; Tinsley and Dayton 2011). Bison availability may
have been a factor, but the faunal assemblage at nearby site 41TR203 contained a significant
number of bison as well as white-tailed deer.
Zooarcheological studies conducted during the data recovery phase were designed to determine
species variability, human subsistence strategies, taphonomic processes, and cultural use of bone.
The faunal analysis was conducted by Dr. Jodi Jacobson. Research design questions posited by
Shipp and Jacobson include:
1. Do the changes in faunal assemblages reflect changes in C3 and C4 ecosystems?
2. Are there a significant number of bison remains?
3. How does the number of bison compare to other open-prairie-style species?
4. Do grassland changes appear to have affected the presence of bison?
5. Do any of the specimens exhibit cut marks?
6. Do the cut marks or other data indicate the animals were butchered on site or were they
brought in from elsewhere?
7. Do the various species reflect a broad-spectrum diet?
8. Does the faunal material reflect a specialized use of the site?
9. Does the assemblage suggest seasonal occupation of the site? If so, is there a change in
seasonality in the AUs?
10. Do the concentrations of faunal remains reflect different processing activities?
11. Is there evidence of bone grease processing?
12. Were some of the rock features used for boiling bones to produce bone grease?

Mercado Site (41TR203)

59

July 2019

13. Was the site near the kill sites of the animals and used as an initial processing site, or does
the evidence suggest a post-processing site? Does this differ between AUs?
Mussel Shell
Mussel shell was present within all AUs at the site and was by far the predominant artifact category
in AUs 4 and 5. This phenomenon is addressed in regard to resource availability and climatic
factors. The shell itself is proxy climate data and may be utilized for stable carbon isotopes, but this
analysis was not conducted.
Mussel shell that represents a non-repetitive element was identified to the lowest taxon possible
(often species in well-preserved assemblages). This reveals the mussel community structure
harvested. Using the program UNIO by Robert Warren, the riverine habitat the shell was harvested
from was estimated. When possible, shell lengths were measured as a proxy for age, enabling
species-specific age histograms to be generated. Depending on the stratification of the assemblage,
potential harvest pressure through time can be assessed by evaluating shifts in the age structure.
While identifying the shell, signs of burning, raccoon predation, and tooling were also noted. By
quantifying the shell, the relative abundance of the mussel community being harvested can be
determined in addition to the likely habitat of the river from which these mussels were collected,
and potentially, the harvest pressure on this mussel community.
Approximately 23 percent of the total mussel shell assemblage was analyzed by Traci Popejoy,
who was guided by the sampling strategies of Woo et al. (2015) and Cambell (2017). Research
questions that she sought to address include:
1. Are the mussel species in AUs 4 and 5 different than the other AUs?
2. Is there tooling evidence on the shells?
3. Were the shells harvested on a regular basis?
4. What was the riverine habitat the shells were collected from, and did it change between
AUs?
5. Do changes in stable carbon isotopes correlate with changes in grassland types?

Mercado Site (41TR203)

July 2019

Botanical Remains
The botanical analysis was conducted by Dr. Leslie Bush. No charred seeds were recovered, only
wood charcoal and two charred bulb fragments. The research questions regarding botanical remains
and subsistence strategies are:
1. What plants were processed at the site?
2. What type of wood was burned as fuel in hearth features?
3. Are these wood types present in the modern vegetation?
4. What types of vegetation were located at the site throughout the Late Archaic occupation to
the Late Prehistoric occupation, and do these differ?
5. Do the plants reflect seasonal use of the site?
6. How does this floral assemblage compare to other regional sites?
Burned Rock Features
Rock features were the most common feature type at the site and ranged from small basin hearths
to burned rock middens. The ways in which people were processing plant and animal resources
using burned rock features provide insight into subsistence strategies beyond simply identifying
what resources were being exploited. The rock features potentially provide information concerning
what level of effort and innovation went into processing the resources and help further our
understanding of plant and animal processing in this region during the Late Archaic period. Burned
rock feature analysis focused on questions such as:
1. What types of resources were processed in each feature?
2. What types of burned rock features are present?
3. What sorts of scenarios occurred to create the archeological remains?
4. Were both plants and animals processed at the site in these features?
5. Are some of the rocks boiling stones?
6. Are the rock features typical of other Late Archaic rock features both inside and outside of
the region?
7. Do rock sizes indicate feature use?

Lithic Technology

The amount of lithic material recovered from the Mercado site was sparse, as is the case with most
of the sites in the region during these periods. However, there were lithics recovered from all AUs,
including 11 projectile points. The lithics were analyzed according to TxDOT protocols. Research
questions regarding lithic material include:
1. Are there distinct lithic assemblages within each AU? How do they vary?
2. What types of stone tool are present within each AU?
3. What types of raw material were being used?
4. What percentage of the lithic material was heat-treated?
4.2.1.5

Geoarcheological Analysis of Burned Earth

As mentioned above, the geoarcheological investigations involved defining the alluvial stratigraphy
(including the Pilot Point Alloformation), creating an age-depth model that defined the
sedimentation rates in each excavation block, analyzing microartifacts, and defining 13 main and
ephemeral occupations.
Other geoarcheological analyses involved soil micromorphology and stable carbon isotopes. The
latter subtopic was addressed above in the paleoenvironment section. The results of the soil
micromorphology indicated that some of the pieces of burned earth were mixed with sand and
burned elsewhere from where they lay. Thus, the burned earth was not burned in-situ, but rather
altered elsewhere and dropped at or near the location of excavation.

identified two morphological variants of burned clay in the artifact assemblage: 1) platy fiber
impressed fragments; and 2) irregular rounded objects. The geoarcheological study (see Chapter 6)
documented three forms of burned earth: 1) in-situ thermal rubified rims associated with thermal
features; 2) small fragments of burned earth presumed to have been detached from the baked earth
of thermal features (presumably scatted by cleaning out hearths and other features); and 3) platy,
apparently sand-tempered objects. The first two categories are thought to be related and were noted
in the soil micromorphological analysis (see Chapter 6, Figures 6.26 and 6.22) as well as in the

microartifact study. The last category, platy burned objects, was incidentally sampled by a
micromorphological sample from Feature 20, Unit 28. Although it was not apparent that the latter
was a fiber-impressed burned object, the appearance of this material in thin section indicated that it
was not incidentally fired site matrix material, but rather contained considerably more sand, and
was most likely a sand-tempered earthen object of some form.
Research included: 1) background research; 2) documentation of the burned earth assemblage in
basic terms; 3) characterization of the materials using various analytical methods, specifically using
thin section petrography and computer tomography; and 4) experimental replication and
subsequent analysis of resulting objects in a manner similar to that used to characterize the burned
earth artifacts.

CHATPER 5 â FIELD AND LABORATORY METHODS

By: Julie Shipp
5.1

Field Methods

The field methods for the date recovery were based on the findings of the NRHP testing. The site
was originally recorded as two sites during the survey phase, including site 41TR202 on the east
side of the highway and site 41TR203 on the west side of the highway. During testing, it appeared
that the cultural occupations were contemporaneous, and the smaller investigated area on the east
side of the highway (41TR202) was incorporated into the site boundary of 41TR203. The largest
concentration of cultural material on the west side of the highway that was located during NRHP
testing was the focus of data recovery excavations.
The deposits appeared as at least three occupation zones in between sterile deposits; thus, a general
excavation method was outlined in the field with TxDOT archeologists in an attempt to maximize
time and effort and avoid excavating numerous unit levels in sterile clay. It was the consensus that
mechanical excavation be employed in between occupations.
5.1.1

Excavation Blocks

Both mechanical and hand excavation were employed to investigate site 41TR203. The plow zone,
which was estimated to be the upper 25 cm of sediment, and the previously identified zones lacking
features and substantial cultural evidence (estimated as 15 to 20 cm in thickness) were removed by
mechanical excavation. The sterile levels were scraped in layers within the entire excavation block
before the hand excavations commenced at Zones I through III. The locations for the handexcavated units were determined based on the locations of known features or occupation surfaces
encountered during NRHP testing.
The original permit research design plan was to hand excavate two levels per occupation zone, or
approximately six levels per 1 by 1-m unit in Excavation Blocks A through D, and six levels in
Block E near Features 4 and 7. The approximate total of hand excavations of cultural zones was
proposed at 348 levels, or 34.8 m3, and up to 40.8 m3. However, as excavations unfolded, it became
apparent that Zones I and II consisted primarily of discrete, scattered features, rather than dense
occupation surfaces, and in some cases were not two levels thick. Excavation units that were not

65

July 2019

used to define feature boundaries, such as mussel shell or burned rock middens, were not
hand-excavated, particularly because the units were not abundant in artifacts; these levels were
mechanically scraped. The use of careful mechanical excavation also improved efficiency and
helped to meet deadlines without the loss of data-rich features. This change in methodology was
discussed and approved verbally in the field by TxDOT archeologists on March 5, 2014.
Block A, a 4 by 4-m excavation block, was placed between BHT 3, where Feature 2 was located,
and BHT 2, where Features 1 (an FCR cluster in Zone 2), 6 (FCR, mussel shell, and bone in
Zone 3), and 8 (FCR, mussel shell, bone, and burned earth in Zone 1) were located (see Chapter 7
and Figure 7.1).
Block B, a 4 by 4-m excavation block, was placed at the north end of aci consultingâs BHT 16,
where Feature 10 was exposed at 25 cmbs (see Chapter 7and Figure 7.1). Feature 10 is a burned
rock midden that was observed in the trench floor and extended into the east, west, and north walls.
The feature was not excavated during the testing phase because of time constraints. The excavation
block was centered over the north end of BHT 16, encompassing Feature 10.
Block C, a 4 by 4-m excavation block, was placed west of the south end of aci consultingâs BHT
11 (see Chapter 7 and Figure 7.1), where Feature 5 (a cluster of FCR, baked earth, and charcoal at
55 to 75 cmbs) was exposed and partially excavated.
Block D, located on the east side of I-35W, was not excavated due to lack of time (see Chapter 7
and Figure 7.2). Rather, aci consulting expanded the geoarcheology trench to investigate the
densest occupations identified during the excavations. To maximize the area investigated, the THC
supported the use of additional exposures with limited hand excavation. An emphasis was directed
toward detecting, recording, and sampling features. Ten 50-cm shovel tests were excavated in a
checkerboard-type pattern on alternating sides of the trench. The shovel tests within the
geoarcheology trench expansion resulted in the recording of nine additional features.
Block E, located in the southern part of the site, was re-opened to explore the possible post features
discovered during the previous testing phase (see Chapter 7 and Figure 7.3). Features 4 and 7 were
relocated, as were two additional possible posts, designated Features 22 and 23. The four post
features appeared to be in an arc pattern of an approximate 4.5-m radius. Although these features
appeared to possibly represent a prehistoric structure that had burned, the nature of the features was
Mercado Site (41TR203)

66

July 2019

still questionable. No substantial lenses of cultural material were observed in the sediments above
these features, suggesting that the occupation surfaces found in other portions of the site do not
extend this far south. Thus, mechanical scraping of about 80 cm in this area was utilized to reach
the top of the cultural zone at which time the 1 by 3-m excavation block. An expedited radiocarbon
sample was sent for analysis during the field investigations. The results of the analysis revealed
Feature 23 was modern (Beta 375548). With concurrence from TxDOT and the THC, further
investigation of Block E was abandoned, and no further excavations were required in the block.
This was devised to maximize the area for data recovery.
Between June 9 and June 17, 2014, aci consulting archeologists conducted further data recovery
investigations at site 41TR203. In the original scope of work, it was proposed that between 34.8
and 40.8 m3 of deposits would be hand-excavated. The total amount of hand excavations when aci
consulting originally left the field was 23.8 m3, which was an insufficient amount to meet the
excavation requirements for the THC permit. The THC required at least an additional 5 m3 of
Zone III be excavated. Thus, Block F was opened west of the geoarcheological trench that had
been excavated by Charles Frederick. Zone III in that block was represented by only an ephemeral
signature of the sheet midden, and it was decided to open an approximately 7.5 by 14.5-m block on
the west side of the geoarcheological trench, which included the entire area in the center of the site
between the previous excavation blocks and the geoarcheological trench. A total of 5.5 m3 of
Zone III was hand-excavated in 23.5 units within Block F. Twenty-three 1 by 1-m and one 1
by 0.50-m excavation units were opened in various small blocks throughout Block F over
potential features that had been exposed during scraping (see Chapter 7 and Figure 7.1).
5.1.2

Backhoe Trenching

One 17-m-long by 1-m-wide trench was machine excavated for geoarcheological purposes from
the south end of Block A to the north end of Block C (see Chapter 7 and Figure 7.1). TxDOT in
consultation with aci consulting decided the focus of the investigataion should shift to the center of
the site, on the west side of the highway where the geoarcheological trench was situated. It was
determined the trench would be extended to the west by an additional 2.4 m, for a total width of
3.4 m, and 15 50-cm test pits were hand-excavated across the floor of Zone III, 5 of which sampled
features. During the subsequent field visit by TxDOT and the THC on March 18, 2014, it was
further suggested that a sample across the floor of Zone III be taken at 50-cm intervals. This
Mercado Site (41TR203)

67

July 2019

revision in methodology was suggested to save time and to gather as much feature data as possible
with the time remaining. The work at the trench was to be equivalent to the 54 levels that were
planned for Block D. TxDOT and the THC approved the above-mentioned approach and change in
effort via email correspondence with aci consulting on March 20, 2014.
5.1.3

Excavation Procedures

A Sokkia Total Station was set up over the main site datum established during the NRHP testing,
which was given the point N 1000 E 3000, elevation 100. A 5-m grid was staked out across the
site. A single vertical datum, relative to the elevation of the site primary datum, was established for
each excavation block.
Prior to excavation, beginning elevations and photographs were taken. Shovel skimming was the
primary excavation technique, with some troweling in instances where a finer provenience is
required, as in the case of feature excavation. Excavation levels were 10-cm thick and were
screened through 1/4-inch (6.35 millimeter [mm]) hardware cloth. An excavation level form was
completed for each 10-cm level. A sketch plan view map of the level floor was drawn, and the
floor was photographed. All artifacts were collected, including FCR, burned earth, daub, lithics,
bone, and shell, and were placed in bags and labeled by unit and level provenience. Artifacts larger
than 3 cm found in-situ were plotted, as well as concentrations of pieces of burned earth and
pedogenic features. The top and bottom elevations were taken for mapped feature artifacts. A
feature form was completed for each feature (see further detail below).
All in-situ charcoal was collected from excavation levels and features, then piece-plotted on field
record maps (see further detail below). Artifacts smaller than 6.35 mm were recovered from the
flotation processing of bulk soil samples; the methodology for this is presented below. Additional
documentation and records included a daily journal maintained by the Project Archeologist,
excavation unit and feature forms, plan view and profile sketches of unit floors and features,
excavation block and trench wall records, photograph logs, field specimen logs, and sample
specimen logs.
5.1.4

Sampling

Bulk soil samples were collected from each hand-excavated level. The bulk soil samples were
taken in 5-cm increments from the southwest corners of all 1 by 1-m excavation units. This resulted
Mercado Site (41TR203)

68

July 2019

in two bulk samples per 10-cm excavation level. Each sample is approximately 10 by 20 by 5 cm in
size and result in about 1 liter in volume. The samples chosen for analysis were determined based
upon the excavation results (i.e., which samples provided the most valuable data for addressing the
proposed research questions). The majority of the samples used were from features. A minimum of
one 2-liter sample from each feature was collected.
An additional 24 bulk samples were collected from the control trench (BHT 25) located along the
northern margin of the site. The trench was opened and a 20 by 10-cm bulk soil sample column
was collected in 5-cm increments to approximately 120 cmbs. These samples served as control
samples for comparative analysis. Additionally, column samples were taken from Blocks A
through C at 5-cm intervals during the geoarcheological analysis.
Samples collected for Accelaerator Mass Spectometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating were primarily
those from charred plant material. As mentioned, radiocarbon samples were collected in-situ from
excavation levels and features. The samples were collected in a way to avoid contamination by
hand touching. Samples were placed in aluminum foil and wrapped to avoid crushing of the
specimen. The sample bags were labeled with the appropriate provenience information, numbered
in sequence with a specimen number, and logged on the specimen sample form. Carbonized
samples were not collected from the screen. The samples selected for submission were chosen after
an inventory of the samples had been completed. Floral and faunal materials were also chosen for
AMS dating.
5.1.5

Feature Excavation

All burned rock hearths and middens were exposed to their full extent during the block excavation
and mapped in plan view. Features were bisected and excavated in controlled 10-cm levels to
expose the feature profiles. All corresponding 1 by 1-m units containing feature materials were
excavated in depth, simultaneously. Any artifacts or burned rock that was encountered during
feature excavation was initially pedestaled. At the base of each level, photographs were taken and
exposed artifacts were mapped in place. Additionally, top and bottom elevations for all sizable
artifacts and burned rock were recorded using the control vertical datum. Following
documentation, all artifacts and burned rock were collected and bagged for further analysis. Once
the base of the feature was reached, the profile was drawn and photographed. The other half of the
feature was treated the same way. All of the feature back fill from burned rock hearths and middens

69

was collected unless the feature size made total collection impractical. In such instances, a 25percent sample of the feature was collected. Feature forms were used to document and describe all
feature attributes including size, shape, depth, artifacts present, matrix descriptions, and degree and
type of thermal alteration.
5.1.5.1

Burned Rock Features

Burned rock hearths and middens were recorded with the possible cooking technologies and
scenarios in mind. Attributes of the features that were recorded include the length, width, outline,
cross-section, rock shape, rock count, rock density, feature coherence, fine matrix, and charcoal.
The nature of the deposits surrounding the feature was also recorded. Collection of these attributes
aided in the interpretation of these often complex but informative cooking features (Ellis 1997).
5.1.5.2

Mussel Shell Middens

All complete mussel shell and fragments of shell including the umbo were collected to determine
the minimum number of individuals. Shell fragments, not including umbos, were counted and
noted on the excavation level forms but not collected.
5.1.5.3

Concentrations of Burned Clay or Daub

Burned clay or possible daub features were treated like other features and recorded in detail, with
samples collected from the burned areas as well as adjacent sediment matrix for thin section
comparisons. Larger portions (approximately 10 cm in size) of burned clay features were collected
for further analysis in the lab.
5.2

Laboratory Methods

Artifacts and samples collected in the field were bagged by material or sample type and recorded
on a Lot Record Form in the field laboratory. The field bags were transported to the aci consulting
laboratory in Austin, Texas. The laboratory staff inventoried the artifact bags, prepared the artifacts
or samples for in-house analysis or transport to specialists for study, and prepared artifacts for
curation at TARL.

5.2.1

Inventory

Artifacts and samples were assigned lot numbers based on provenience. Lot numbers were
assigned in the field laboratory, and lot information was recorded on a lot record inventory.
Artifacts were stored and then transported to the aci consulting laboratory in Austin, Texas in large
plastic bins. After arriving at the laboratory, all artifact bags were accounted for and the lot record
was entered into the electronic Microsoft Access database created for the testing phase at site
41TR203. The database has since been converted to Microsoft Excel.
5.2.2

Cleaning and Sorting of Artifacts

Once in the laboratory, artifacts were cleaned and re-bagged as necessary. This involved washing
or brushing. Cleaning methods were determined on a case-by-case basis in part by the preferences
or requirements of the artifact analysts. Once the artifact bags were cross-checked with the field
records and electronic database, artifact bags were sorted into analytical categories. These
analytical categories were initially based on material types. Further into the analysis, samples of
artifacts were chosen for special studies.
5.2.3

Analysis Techniques

FCR was sorted in the aci consulting laboratory before being sent to a studies specialist. Soils,
faunal, lithics, mussels, botanical material, and burned earth were analyzed in the laboratories of
the special studies scientists.
5.2.4

Fire-cracked Rock

FCR was subject to a basic analysis in the aci consulting laboratory. The rocks from features were
sorted and charted by size, from 1 to 15 centimeters. FCR was then transported to Dr. Richard
Thompson Stark for further analysis. Data was analyzed from the following domains of relevance:
size-longitudinal axis (mm), weight-scaled measurements (grams), weights per feature, weights per
AU, cumulative weights, presence/absence of vugs, fractures descriptions (polygonal, curvilinear,
dendritic, hackly, steppe), plan view photos/illustrations of refit joints, color (cortex/core) (Munsell
values integrated describing the cortex and profile), refit analysis limited to within features, and
general vertical distribution of FCR.

5.2.5

Lithics

Lithics from the data recovery investigations of site 41TR203 were analyzed by Dr. James W.
Karbula according to TxDOT lithic analysis protocol in the PaleoWest laboratory.
5.2.6

Faunal

The faunal material was analyzed to the highest taxonomic level possible, or to the approximate
size of the animal at a minimum. The specimens were counted for the number of identified
specimens (NISP) and minimum number of individuals (MNI) when possible. The faunal
specimens were examined for rodent gnawing, evidence of burning, fracturing, and butchering
marks. Paleoenvironmental data was also obtained from the faunal material. The faunal analysis
was conducted by Dr. Jodi Jacobson, formerly of TRC Solutions, Inc.
5.2.7

Mussels

Mussel shell was counted for the NISP. MNI was not calculated for mussels due to the degree of
fragmentation. Because of this, only whole mussel shells or those that at least retained the umbo
were collected. The mussel analysis was conducted by Traci Popejoy, PhD Candidate at the
University of Oklahoma.
5.2.8

Botanical

The bulk samples selected for analysis underwent flotation processing in the aci consulting
laboratory. A 60-gram subsample of the soil was removed prior to flotation for possible soils and
microbotanical analysis. These samples were not utilized. The light fractions of the flotation
samples were sent to Dr. Leslie Bush for analysis.
5.2.9

Burned Earth

The burned earth was treated to a basic analysis in the aci consulting laboratory. These artifacts
were weighed and examined for distinguishing features, such as fiber impressions. Dr. Charles
Frederick conducted further analysis on the burned earth.

Soil

The soil samples were analyzed for texture, calcium carbonate content, organic carbon content, and
magnetic susceptibility. The detailed profile drawings from the backhoe trenches and excavation
blocks aided in the analysis. This work was conducted by Dr. Charles Frederick.
5.3

Curation

Artifacts, excluding culled materials such as burned rock and soil, and records of the investigation
will be curated at TARL in Austin, Texas. The collection will be prepared in accordance with the
facilityâs requirements for curation.

CHAPTER 6 â GEOARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

By: Charles D. Frederick and Arlo McKee
This chapter presents the results of geoarcheological investigations of the alluvial deposits exposed
at site 41TR203. Using data derived from analysis of the bulk physical properties, soil
micromorphology, microartifacts, and radiocarbon dating, this work presents a stratigraphic
framework for the data recovery in archeological excavations.
6.1

Setting

Archeological site 41TR203 is situated on the floodplain of the West Fork of the Trinity River,
immediately west of I-35W and south of Northside Drive in Fort Worth, Texas. Today, the site lies
adjacent to the north bank of the river, but prior to channelization in the mid-20th century, the West
Fork of the Trinity River was considerably more sinuous and only closely approached the site on
the northwest (Figure 6.1). The site resides about halfway between the 1915 Trinity River channel
and the northeast valley wall, defined by the outcrop of the Lower Cretaceous undivided Pawpaw
Formation, Weno Limestone, and Denton Clay (BEG 1972).
The soil mapped at the site by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is Frio silty
clay, 0-1 percent slopes, occasionally flooded (Ressel 1981). The Frio soil series is classified as a
fine, smectitic, thermic Cumulic Haplustoll and is described as forming within âvery deep, welldrained, moderately slowly, permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy and clayey alluviumâ
(National Cooperative Soil Survey 2015). The type section for the Frio series exhibits an A-Bk
profile where the A-horizon is divisible into four parts and is about 1 m thick.
6.2

Alluvial Stratigraphy

The cultural deposits at the site lie within the Pilot Point Alloformation of the Trinity River. The
Late Quaternary alluvial stratigraphy of the Trinity River has been described by Ferring (1994,
1990), and the Pilot Point is one of seven unconformity-bounded (or allostratigraphic) units
identified by Ferring. A suite of 32 radiocarbon ages are cited by Ferring (1994: 51â52) for this
deposit, and these indicate deposition of the Pilot Point Alloformation occurred in the middle to
late Holocene between approximately 4500 and 500 yr Cal BP.

Mercado Site (41TR203)

Figure 6.1. Trinity River Channel 1915

76

Although the thickness of the Pilot Point is not explicitly stated by Ferring (1994), examination of
the measured sections he documented provides some impressions. In the flood basin facies, the
deposit is generally between 1.5 m and 3 m thick (e.g., 3 m at the Aubrey Site; 1.6 m at site
41CO144-J), whereas in the near channel meander belt facies it is much thicker, often in excess of
6 m (e.g., 6.1 m at 41CO144-C; > 6 m at 41CO141-NC1).
The alluvial architecture (or three-dimensional arrangement of the alluvial deposits) identified by
Ferring suggests that for the majority of the Holocene, the floodplain of the Trinity River has been
vertically aggrading, depositing each allostratigraphic unit directly upon the previous one in a layer
cake manner. This has resulted in the Pilot Point Alloformation being the surficial deposit of the
floodplain in most places, although in proximity to the modern channel, it is often buried by a thin
(<1 m) veneer of the Recent Alluvium. As a result, numerous archeological studies have
encountered the Pilot Point Alloformation. In fact, it is relatively uncommon for such studies of the
Trinity River floodplain to expose any deposit older than the Pilot Point.
Although a number of different alluvial depositional facies have been described for the Pilot Point
Alloformation, Ferring mentions only one soil formed within it, which he named the âWest Fork
Soil.â This soil sometimes occurs as the surface soil on the floodplain, and in other places as a
paleosol where it has been buried by sediments associated with the youngest alloformation, the
Recent Alluvium. This soil is present toward the top of the Pilot Point, and the top of this soil is the
upper boundary of this alloformation where it has been buried by recent sediments. The period of
formation of the West Fork soil is noted by Ferring (1994:59) to be somewhat variable. A cumulic
or pachic variant is described as having âformed on floodplains between ca. 4.5 ka and the
present,â whereas âa facies of the âWest Fork soilâ formed along meander belts as the rate of
lateral migration of channels slowed between ca. 1.5â1.4 kaâ and this soil is found adjacent to
modern meander belts often buried by Recent Alluvium.
Following Ferringâs work, several archeological studies have determined the age of the West Fork
Soil by direct radiocarbon dating of soil organic matter, charcoal, and in some instances, mussel
shell. Some, such as Hall et al. (2011), have suggested that the formation of this soil in flood basin
settings is a shorter duration than Ferring advocates for the cumulic version and longer than the
lateral migration variant. Specifically, Hall et al. (2011) argue that the West Fork Paleosol on the
Clear Fork of the Trinity at 41TR170 was formed between 2300 and 1000 yr Cal BP and represents
Mercado Site (41TR203)

77

July 2019

a wet meadow soil that was buried by channel rejuvenation associated with the onset of the
Mediaeval warm around 1000 years ago. Other studies (e.g., Skinner et al., 2005; Skinner et al.
n.d.) have noted the presence of multiple stacked buried soils within thick sections of the Pilot
Point Alloformation, but the origins of such exceptional occurrences are still relatively poorly
understood. Given that thick deposits of the Pilot Point principally occur within meander belt
environments, it is likely that multiple buried soils within thick deposits of the Pilot Point occur
near the rear of meander belts and at the edge of the flood basin environments, and that the location
and age of such occurrences are controlled by local depositional factors such as distance from
channel, height of surface above the channel, threshold of overbank sedimentation, as well as
regional climatic factors (see discussion in Frederick et al. 2006).
In order to more objectively assess the age of the West Fork soil, we compiled a sample of
radiocarbon age determinations obtained for this soil by various archeological studies, including
the work by Ferring (1994) and the work done as part of this Project (Table 6.1 presents the list of
dates and sources below). This list, which consists of 40 age determinations from work done prior
to this study, is not intended to be comprehensive and does not include work done on small
tributaries of the Trinity River. When the results of this study are included, the total increases to 74
dates. The resulting dates were then calibrated and compiled into aggregate sum probability
distributions, which are shown in aggregate form on Figure 6.2 and by site on Figure 6.3.

all of the sites listed on Table 6.1. Plots in red are from this site, the West Fork Soil (top 65 cm of
the profile) and the Paleosol (below 100 cm).
The results provide a much clearer image of the age of the West Fork Soil/Paleosol. In the
aggregate, the age of the West Fork Soil using all samples returns a mean and standard deviation of
1531Â±159 yr Cal BP and spans the period between approximately 4000 and 250 yr Cal BP with the
majority falling between 700 and 2400 yr Cal BP. If the results of this Project are excluded, the age
is 1662Â±784 yr Cal BP. As can be seen on Figure 6.3 the age of the West Fork Soil varies
considerably between sites.
In the Radiocarbon Ages column of Table 6.1, the two-letter keys for material dated are bs = bulk
soil, ch = charcoal, and sh = mussel shell.

The Pilot Point Alloformation at 41TR203

The alluvial deposits that comprise the site were examined in block excavations A, B, and C, and
within a single, long backhoe trench that spanned nearly the entire distance between Block A (the
northernmost block excavation) and Block C. A control trench was also excavated off site. From
each block excavation and the trench, a profile was drawn and described. These profiles are
illustrated on Figures 6.4, 6.5, and 6.6. A similar profile was observed in each of these exposures,
and a composite stratigraphic profile for the site is provided on Figure 6.7, and a general
description is provided on Table 6.2. The site deposits are divided into two basic groups: 1) Upper
Pilot Point, which comprises the upper meter of the excavations; and 2) the Lower Pilot Point,
which consists of deposits below 1 m. The top approximate 60 cm of the Upper Pilot Point exhibits
a distinct soil, which is identified as the West Fork Soil. The entire exposed section of the Lower
Pilot Point has been altered to form a soil as well, and this feature is here termed the Paleosol. The
site excavations did not expose the top of the next older alloformation, the Sanger, and cores

obtained by Osburn et al. (2005) suggest that this deposit lies more than 3.6 m below the present
ground surface. The two cores obtained from the site indicate that beneath the Paleosol, the Pilot
Point here is comprised of near channel overbank sediments (aka a crevasse splay).

In order to characterize the nature of the deposits, samples were collected at 5-cm increments from
each of the three block excavations, and the control trench and these samples were characterized in
the lab for particle size distribution, calcium carbonate content, magnetic susceptibility, organic
carbon content and stable carbon isotopic composition of soil organic carbon. The particle size
distribution was determined on a Beckman-Coulter LS13-320 Lasersizer, and were pre-treated with
30 percent hydrogen peroxide and concentrated sodium hydroxide to remove organic matter, and

gasometrically with a Chittick device (cf. Dreimanis 1962; Machette 1986), and the magnetic
susceptibility was determined on a Bartington MS2 meter and an MS2b sensor (Gale and
Hoare 1991). Organic carbon content and stable carbon isotopes were determined by Greg Cane
using a Costech 4010 elemental analyzer (EA) in conjunction with a Thermo Finnigan MAT 253
Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, Germany) at the Keck Paleoenvironmental and
Environmental Stable Isotope Laboratory, Department of Geology, University of Kansas

Figure 6.11. Depth Variation in Sediment/Soil Physical Properties of the Deposits within the
Control Trench
In general terms, the deposits show little textural variation with respect to depth. Block A contains
more sand than the other profiles and exhibits a slight upward coarsening in the top 40 cm and a
similar but less pronounced trend within the paleosol. The cores examined by Osburn et al. (2005)
note a coarsening of the Pilot Point from southeast to northwest at this site, and this is generally
consistent with the trend observed within the block profiles. But it is fair to say that there is little
textural variation within the deposits overall. All three excavation block profiles show subtle but
clear magnetic susceptibility enhancement of the West Fork Soil and the Paleosol, and this is most
notable with respect to the ACk horizon that separates them, which exhibits notably lower low
frequency magnetic susceptibility values. All the profiles exhibit clear visible evidence of organic
enrichment of the West Fork Soil in the upper 60 cm of the profile and the Paleosol, but laboratory
analysis of organic carbon content fails to show a clear organic enrichment of the Paleosol, which
is perplexing, given the clear melanization of this deposit that was visible in the field (see Figure
6.7). Calcium carbonate content is low within the West Fork Soil and the Paleosol, and varies
inversely with respect to the magnetic susceptibility, as one would expect if the variation in
calcium carbonate is related to soil formation.
But Ferring (1994:116) notes that the vertical variation of calcium carbonate within the Pilot Point
Alloformation is an artifact of depositional control, stating that, âSoil formation was pronounced
when deposition rates slowed and when finer sediments were deposited; the finer sediments had
lower initial carbonate content, resulting in a vertical carbonate distribution similar to that in a
Mercado Site (41TR203)

90

July 2019

profile in which a soil had formed.â In other words, Ferring argues that the decrease in carbonate
within the West Fork Soil is due to deposition of less carbonate-rich sediment rather than
pedogenesis and dissolution by meteoric water (i.e., rainfall). First, there is no correlation between
particle size and calcium carbonate content (Pearson product moment correlation coefficient of r =
0.1890), but a weak negative correlation between low frequency magnetic susceptibility and
calcium carbonate (Pearson product moment correlation coefficient of r = -0.3513). There is a
reasonable necalgative correlation between organic carbon and calcium carbonate (Pearson product
moment correlation coefficient of r = -0.4729), indicating that deposits with the greatest organic
carbon have the lowest calcium carbonate content, which is what would be expected if the
carbonate content was affected by leaching by meteoric water. Hence, despite the anomalous
absence of organic matter enrichment within the Paleosol, the other physical attributes are
consistent with both the West Fork Soil and the Paleosol as pedogenic features. It is interesting to
note that the Paleosol also corresponds with a period of slower sedimentation that occurred
between approximately 2600 and 2050 yr Cal BP (see age-depth model discussion below).
In regard to magnetic susceptibility, it was noted previously that both the West Fork Soil and the
Paleosol appear to exhibit magnetic susceptibility enhancement. But in addition to this, the
magnetic susceptibility plots all three block profiles illustrate one or more discrete anomalies, and
comparison of these with the microartifact data indicates that each one is attributable to an
occupation. In Block A, there is a single discrete rise in magnetic susceptibility between 40 and 50
cm that directly corresponds with the major occupation in the Zone I excavation slice, whereas in
Block B, there is a prominent peak in magnetic susceptibility at 20 cm that directly corresponds
with the uppermost occupation and specifically a peak in fragments of micro-burned earth. In
Block C, there are two small discrete peaks in the magnetic susceptibility curve, one at 20 cm,
which corresponds with a peak in small FCR, and another around 50 cm, which directly
corresponds with the major occupation within the top of the Zone II excavation slice. Hence, it
appears that the broad trends in magnetic susceptibility are of a pedogenic origin, but the abrupt
changes are anthropogenic.

Age-Depth Model and Sedimentation Rate

In order to better understand the age structure of the deposits, the radiocarbon dates from each of
the blocks (A through C) were analyzed to produce an age-depth model that reflects sedimentation
Mercado Site (41TR203)

91

on the site. This included 33 radiocarbon dates that were analyzed from both feature contexts and
microartifact samples. The age-depth model was produced using the Bchron package in R Studio
(Parnell 2014; R Core Team 2014). The Bchron package was developed for the task of studying
sedimentation rates in aggrading settings that typically reflect relatively continuous sedimentation,
such as lacustrine settings. Settings with pauses in sedimentation can cause difficulties.
The methods that the Bchron package uses to produce an age-depth model have been fully
presented by Haslett and Parnell (2008) and Parnell, et al. (2008) and are only briefly reviewed
here. Models are produced by first inputting raw radiocarbon ages, standard deviations, and depth
measurements. The ages are then calibrated according to a published radiocarbon calibration curve.
In the case of site 41TR203, intcal13 was used (Reimer et al. 2013). The calibrated age
probabilities are then calculated for each measured sample in the profile and assigned to that
sample depth. An age-depth model is then calculated using the calibrated age-depth probability
distributions to simulate potential ever-increasing paths through the profile. This is to state that the
only assumption that the model makes is that the sediments were deposited with the oldest deposits
at the bottom and youngest at the top. The model is left to iterate through 10,000 ever-increasing
random paths, and the probability occurrence of the iterated paths is used to estimate the
parameters of a Poisson-Gamma distribution for each depth in the core. The 95 percent CI of the
age-depth model and the probability distributions of each sampled date are then plotted and output
to an image file (Figure 6.12)

Mercado Site (41TR203)

Figure 6.12. Results of the Age-depth Calculations from Blocks AâC
Figure 6.12 shows the differences in each profile calculation and the final aggregate age-depth
model using all profiles on the right. Notice the numerous age reversals have resulted in the agedepth calculation following the path of greatest probability and allowing for both younger and
older dates to be incorporated in the upper 50 cm of the profile.
This method allows for the sedimentation rates of each of the profiles to be compared. Although
each block contained a comparable stratigraphic profile, there were differences in age-depth
projections for the upper portion of the profile that varied by up to 500 years. The results, shown in
the three panels on the left side of Figure 6.12 suggest that this is likely a function of the numerous
age reversals present in each profile. These reversals become compounded when combining dates
across the site. The majority of the reversals occur in the range between approximately 20 and 60
cm. Additional turbation was evident in the analysis of the microartifact samples in the upper 30
cm of the profile (discussed below). Following examination of the age-depth models for each
block, it was concluded that the most reliable approach was to aggregate all the radiocarbon ages
for the site and use the combined data set to compile an age-depth model for the entire site, and this
plot is shown on the right side of Figure 6.12.

Mercado Site (41TR203)

The principle advantage of using this method is that it facilitates estimating the age of unsampled
locations of the profile with associated uncertainties. These data are therefore useful for assessing
temporal variations in sedimentation rate at the site (Figure 6.13 and Table 6.3) and estimating the
probable age of the different occupations (discussed below in the Microartifacts section). Visual
inspection of the simplified age-depth plot suggests that the sedimentation rate at the site has varied
through time, between periods of relatively rapid sedimentation (e.g., ~2700 to 2600 yr Cal BP
[15.75 cm/century], ~2040 to 1880 yr Cal BP [13.44 cm/century], ~1450 to 1200 year Cal BP
[9.87 cm/century], and ~620 to 460 yr Cal BP [4.27 cm/century]) and periods of slower
sedimentation (e.g., 260 to -2040 yr Cal BP [5.28 cm/century], ~1880 to 1450 yr Cal BP
[3.24 cm/century], ~1200 to 620 yr Cal BP [2.12 cm/century], and ~460 yr Cal BP to present
[0.7 cm/century]). Hence, the West Fork Soil, which generally occupies the upper 60 cm of the site,
appears to be attributable to a period of slow sedimentation that occurred after 1200 yr Cal BP
(although the earliest phase appears to also encompass a period of more rapid sedimentation
between ~1500 and 1200 yr Cal BP). Interestingly, the Paleosol, which occurs at the site at depth
below a meter, appears to be formed during a period of slower sedimentation that occurred between
2600 and 2050 yr Cal BP.

Microartifact Analysis

A single 20 by 20-cm column of bulk sediment samples was collected at 5-cm increments from one
wall of excavation Blocks A, B and C, and from the control trench. These samples were
subsequently disaggregated with sodium hexametaphosphate, wet-sieved through a 1-mm sieve,
and then dried. The dried residues were then passed through 2- and 4-mm sieves, and the cultural
material from each size fraction (1 mm, 2 mm, and 4 mm) was separated by type (specifically
debitage, burned rock, burned earth, mussel shell, charcoal, bone, and Historic artifacts) then
counted and weighed. A total of 11,737 microartifacts were identified for a combined weight of
1,625 grams (g). The results of this work are presented graphically by count on Figures 6.14, 6.16,
6.18, and 6.20 and by weight percent on Figures 6.15, 6.17, 6.19, and 6.21. These data were then
used in conjunction with drawings of the excavation block walls from where the columns were
collected to identify the stratigraphic position of the various occupation zones.
6.5.1

Occupation History as Inferred from the Microartifact Data

A close examination of the depth distribution of the cultural material recovered by the microartifact
columns suggests that there are about 13 prehistoric occupations at the site during the last 2,700
years and were designated A through M. Four of these occupations appear, on the basis of ubiquity
within the microartifact columns, to represent significant presence within the block excavations,
and they are B (Late Prehistoric, ~1100 to 600 yr Cal BP), E (Late Prehistoric, ~1400 to 1350 yr
Cal BP), G (Transitional Archaic, ~1730 to 1470 yr Cal BP), and L (Late Archaic, ~2585 to 2300
yr Cal BP). In the following discussions and data presentations, the presumed occupations are
referred to in depth below surface rather than elevation, primarily because the relative depositional
position is better captured by depth for occupations which exhibit subtle slopes. For instance, an
occupation surface that is dipping within a large stratigraphic unit may consistently have the same
depth below surface but be represented by different elevations owing to the sloping surface.
As previously noted, the deposits at the site appear to represent relatively continual sedimentation
throughout the last 2,700 years, although the sedimentation rate appears to have varied slightly
through time. Most of the prehistoric occupations appear to exhibit fairly discrete depth profiles,
which when viewed in light of the sedimentation rate, imply fairly good contextual integrity. Two
places in the profile, however, present exceptions to this generalization: 1) the plow zone (top 30 or
35 cm); and 2) the lowest occupations (L and M, ~110 to 135 cm).
Mercado Site (41TR203)

96

July 2019

The presence of Historic age artifacts to a depth of about 35 cm suggests that plowing dispersed
historic materials downward into sediments that were originally deposited in the Late Prehistoric,
between 500 and 1,200 years ago, and most likely dispersed Late Prehistoric cultural material
upward. Prehistoric materials were noted above 30 cm in all three block excavations, and some of
these materials exhibited peaked depth distributions; however, it is not clear if these represent
discrete occupations with integrity or the depth frequency is merely are an artifact of Historic
dispersion of prehistoric remains by the plow.
The most significant and widely dispersed occupation is L (and possibly M), that was the subject of
the Zone III excavations in each block. This occupation is thicker than most, and different artifact
classes exhibit peaks at slightly different depths, which to the conclusion that this âsingle
occupation,â which is estimated to have occurred between 2585 and 2300 yr Cal BP, may represent
a surface with more time averaging than most, and really be the result of multiple short stays over a
long period of time.
Between the base of the plow zone and Occupation L, the microartifact data suggests that the site
was repeatedly occupied between ~2250 and1200 yr Cal BP, but only two of these appear to have
been significant (E and G). Most of these occupations are represented by very small artifact
occurrences and either are occupations for which the blocks are on the edge of the occupation
surface or very short duration stays. The nearly continuous presence of these occupations (when
observed as depths on Table 6.4) may be due to a too literal interpretation of the microartifact
depths. In addition, some of the occupations represented as âdistinctâ events in different blocks
may be the same event owing to small scale vagaries in sedimentation.

In the section below, the results of the microartifact columns are discussed for each separate block
excavation and summarized on Tables 6.5 through 6.7.
6.5.1.1

Block A

Within the Block A microartifact column, Historic materials were noted to co-occur with
prehistoric materials to a depth of 20 cm, which is most likely an artifact of plowing moving
Historic items down the profile. The prehistoric occupations that appear to be present are listed on
Table 6.5. Prehistoric materials exhibit a broad but distinct peak between 10 and 20 cmbs, with
charcoal, bone, mussel shell, lithics, and FCR all peaking in this portion of the profile. This peak is
separate from a smaller but discrete occurrence of charcoal, mussel shell, lithics, and FCR at the
very top of the Zone I excavation slice at 30 cmbs. The main occupation within the Zone I slice is
located between 40 and 45 cm and is represented by elevated amounts of bone, charcoal, burned
earth, lithics and FCR. Between the Zone I and the Zone III excavation slices, there is a very subtle
increase in charcoal, bone, burned earth, and lithics at 60 cmbs, and in lithics, mussel shell, and

top of the Zone III excavation slice at 95 cm; however, the main prehistoric expression in this
excavation slice is between 110 and 115 cm and is represented in the microartifact column by
peaks in all artifact classes. The fact that the frequencies rise to the base of the column suggests
that the microartifact column was not deep enough to bracket this entire occupation.

as 15 cm. There appears to be a shallow occupation that has been dispersed upward, the peak of
which is probably right at the top of Zone 1 around 15 to 25 cm, which consists of FCR, burned
earth, and a few lithics and mussel shells. The south wall profile exhibited a clear component
around 40 cmbs (D), but in the microartifact data this is very subtle, with minor peaks in bone
fragments and burned earth. A much more pronounced occupation is present immediately below
this around 45 to 55 cm, denoted by discrete level of mussel shell, burned earth and FCR, and in
the south wall profile this occupation was a nearly continuous line of mussel shell. A very small
peak in burned earth and medium and small bone fragments between 60 and 65 cm may represent
an occupation (H?) as well, but this was not noted in the south wall profile nor represented by other
artifact classes. A few isolated flakes of microdebitage were observed between excavation zones II
and III (cf. 75 to 80 cmbs, 95 cmbs), but these were not associated with any other artifact classes
and may be occupations not well represented in Block B. Within the Zone III excavation strip there
is a very pronounced occupation that appears to between 115 and 125 cm, represented by every
artifact class. The thickness of this occupation zone suggests that it may be more than one
occupation that occurred in a relatively short period. The final occupation within the Block B
column is present at the very base of the Zone III excavation, around 135 cmbs, and is represented
by increases in small and medium bone fragments and one FCR.

as well as around 20 cm, and mussel shell around 20 cm. The first clear relatively undisturbed
prehistoric presence is present around 30 to 35 cmbs, represented by small but consistent amounts
of charcoal, burned earth, and FCR. This suite of occupation debris does just overlap with the
lowest Historic materials and it is possible that this occupation surface is the source of some of the
prehistoric cultural material within the plow zone. There is a prominent occupation between 55 and
70 cmbs near the top of the Zone II excavation window, which is represented by FCR, lithics,
burned earth, and mussel shell. A second component appears to be present near the base of the
Zone II excavation, around 75 to 85 cmbs, consisting of small but apparently discrete increases in
mussel shell and lithics. Burned earth does not show a bimodal distribution within the Zone II
excavation, but rather a broad smear peaking around 60 to 65 cm and trailing off gradually, and the
presumed occupation around 75 to 80 cm is within the tail of this distribution. Between the Zone II
and Zone III excavations there are two isolated occurrences that may represent occupations. The
first is a small peak in mussel shell around 95 cm, and the second is a small peak in burned earth
that peaks at 105 cm. Within the Zone III excavation slice, there is a prominent occupation near the
top of the block, between 110 and 125 cmbs, represented by every artifact class, but the peak depth
varies by material. This variation may indicate that this occurrence is actually more than one
occupation. At the very base of the Zone III excavation there is a rise in charcoal, bone, mussel
shell, and lithics which appears to represent another occupation surface.

Soil Micromorphology

Four samples were collected from the site excavations for petrographic examination. The majority
of these were derived from the Late Archaic occupations in the Zone II excavations. A single
sample was collected from the deposits exposed in Zone II excavations in Block B. The samples
collected were: 1) Block B, South Wall, Zone II; 2) Block B South Wall, Zone III; 3) Block A,
Zone III, Unit 23, Level 5 (130 to 140 cm), Feature 20, burned earth within occupation; and 4)
Block C, Zone III, Level 8 (130â140 cm), Feature 24.

Mercado Site (41TR203)

Samples collected for micromorphology consisted of oriented blocks carved from the excavation
walls/floors that were then wrapped in toilet tissue and masking tape, and subsequently dried,
embedded in polyester resin under a vacuum, then slabbed on a rock saw. The block samples were
first dried at low temperature (50ËC) in a convection oven then embedded in polyester resin under a
vacuum when less than 15 cm long. Larger samples were not vacuum-embedded. Samples were
first unwrapped then placed in a plastic container and the provenience and orientation information
transferred to the new sample container. Then the embedding medium, a 7:3 mixture of
unpromoted polyester resin and styrene mixed with a small amount of methyl ethyl ketone
peroxide catalyst, was added to the container up to the upper edge of the sample but with care not
to completely immerse the sample.
The sample was then placed in a vacuum desiccator and placed under a vacuum with a vacuum
pump. After a few minutes, the vacuum was released, and more resin added if necessary, then once
again placed under a vacuum. This procedure was repeated about four times, after which the
sample was removed from the desiccator and resin once again added to nearly, but not completely,
cover the sample. The next day, the samples were completely immersed in polyester and allowed to
cure for about a week. Once the polyester set, samples were placed in a low temperature (50ËC)
convective oven overnight to completely harden the polyester. The samples were then slabbed with
a rock saw using mineral oil as the lubricant. Slabs were subsequently scanned on a flatbed
scanner, the locations for thin sections selected, and the position then drawn on a print of the slab.
The thin section blanks were then cut from the slabs using a water-cooled trim saw, immediately
dried, labeled, and notched for orientation.
The seven prepared blanks were then submitted to HD Analytical Solutions, Inc. (London, Ontario,
Canada) for thin section manufacture. Upon completion the prepared 2 by 3-in (51-x-76-mm) thin
sections were scanned at 1000 dpi using transmitted light on a flatbed scanner and an 8.5 by 11-in
color print made. The enlarged prints of the slides were examined for features of interest, and the
thin sections were then examined at low magnification on a Leica S8APO binocular microscope
equipped to permit transmitted polarized light microscopy. The lowest magnification on the
S8APO permits viewing a 1-cm-wide area of the slide, whereas the highest magnification provides
a 1.5-mm-wide field of view. High magnification examination was performed on a Leica DMEP
polarizing light compound microscope. Photomicrographs of samples were collected using a Leica

general guidelines provided by Bullock et al. (1985) and Stoops (2003).
6.6.1

Block B, Zones II and III

Two samples were collected from the south wall of the Block B excavations including one from
Zone II and one from Zone III. The sample from Zone II yielded a single slide that was centered on
visible occupation materials, specifically a mussel shell and a fragment of burned earth.
Examination of the slide revealed the presence of strong subangular blocky to weak prismatic
structure and a chamber microstructure. The sample exhibits an open porphyric related distribution
with a small amount of fine sand set in a silty clay matrix, and overall the deposit exhibits a c/f
ratio of 20:80 with a limit of 0.1 mm. The ground mass is light brown in plane light and exhibits a
speckled b-fabric in cross-polarized light. About 1 to 2 percent of the slide consisted of small (0.25
mm thick) calcium carbonate coats lining pores.
The cultural material on this slide consists of one large item (a mussel shell) and a single rounded
aggregate of burned earth. No large charcoal fragments are present, but there are numerous very
small (0.02 to 0.05 mm) fragments scattered across the slide, with the greatest concentrations
observed with fecal pellets (worm casts; see bottom right panel on Figure 6.22). The sample from
Zone III shows a similar pattern, except there small cultural materials are dispersed across 10 cm of
sediment with no obvious occupation surface or even clear concentrations. Although worms are
incapable of moving large artifacts, they are capable of dispersing small materials <1 to 2 mm in
diameter and may also bury and concentrate larger items by bioexhumation.

dispersed charcoal. The passage feature on the right (labeled YPF) is presumably younger, and still
retains a porous, and dispersed fecal microfragments. Other passage features are visible on this
image, and it is likely that much of this fine matrix has been reworked by worms on more than one
occasion.
6.6.2

Floor of Block A

A single block was collected from a patch of burned earth that was exposed on the floor of Unit 28,
between 130 and 140 cmbd, in Block A, Zone II excavation. In the field it was anticipated that this
was part of an in-situ thermal feature (such as a thermal reaction rim that might be associated with
a fire kindled on a flat surface), but the thin section revealed that this interpretation is incorrect.
The location of the sample within the excavation unit is shown in the top left portion of Figure
6.23, and a photograph of this object prior to collection of the sample is shown in the top right
portion of Figure 6.23. After the block was embedded and slabbed, it became apparent that the
burned objects in question had very sharp lower boundaries (see Figure 6.23, bottom left). This is
inconsistent with in-situ thermal oxidation rims under heated features, which are typically clear to
gradual. Examination of the thin section revealed that the burned objects in question, which were
about 23 mm long by 8 mm tall, consist of a mixture of fine to medium sand and silty clay similar
to the site matrix, resulting in a close porphyric related distribution and a c/f ratio of 60:40. The
sand fraction is composed of approximately 60 percent quartz and 40 percent carbonate rock
fragments. The sand and fine material are poorly mixed together, with distinct patches of each
clearly visible. The fragments exhibit a subtle horizontal fabric parallel or slightly subparallel with
the long axis of the fragments. The fine portion of the matrix is a reddish-brown color in plane
light, and the carbonate rock fragments all appear gray, consistent with exposure to heat.

(highlighted in a thin black line). Rectangles A and B are locations of photomicrographs shown on
Figure 6.24.
None of the site matrix contains anywhere near this much sand (Figure 6.24, top half), and this fact,
considered together with the abrupt edges (especially the bottom edge) of these objects suggests
that they represent sand-tempered silty clay that was subsequently burned and dropped onto the
occupation surface. They were not fired here in this location, but it is not clear if this object was
fired intentionally or accidentally, but the fact that they exhibit oxidized colors throughout, as
opposed to the carbon core typically associated with ceramics, suggests that they were fired in a
high-temperature freely oxidizing thermal environment different from most prehistoric ceramics. It
is probable that this object (or objects) was made of clay mixed with sand to check cracking of the
smectite-rich clay. Burned objects similar to this were observed at site 41DL203 (Tinsley et al.
2011:111â117), except there were more prominent fiber impressions on one side and they were
fired a higher temperature, as indicated by the fact that the clays had started to sinter. Following
experimentation designed to try and replicate them, it was concluded that the most likely origin
was a mud plastered thatch roof. The objects here (at site 41TR203) were not fired at as high of a
temperature as the ones observed at site 41DL203, but some of the burned earth objects from this
occupation do have fiber impressions. It may be worth a closer look at some of the fiber-impressed
objects during a later phase of the analysis.
Apart from the burned objects, the deposits beneath Feature 20 were typical for the site. These
sediments exhibit a prominent 15 to 17-mm-wide prismatic structure that parts to 5 to-10 mm
subangular blocky structure and has a chamber to channel microstructure. The open
porphyric-related distribution consists of a small amount of fine sand set in a silty clay matrix, and
overall the deposit exhibits a c/f ratio of 20:80 with a limit of 0.1 mm. The ground mass is light
brown in plane light and exhibits a speckled b-fabric in cross-polarized light. There appear to be
about 5 percent of pores with relatively thick (0.25 mm) coats of calcium carbonate (see Figure
6.24, bottom two photos). Several clear, weakly coalesced and porous passage features consistent
with worm bioturbation were observed, and many others that have subsequently coalesced into a
dense matrix are suspected given the number of arcuate edges observed across the slide.

Feature 24

A distinct deposit of ash and burned earth, Feature 24 was exposed in Units 47 and 50, within
Block C, Zone III, Level 8, 130 to 140 cmbd (Figure 6.25). A single large micromorphology block
was collected from Feature 24, and it was embedded in two parts as it naturally parted along ash in
the upper third of the block. Three thin sections were made from this block (Figure 6.26, panel 1).
Although the site notes do not clearly state an interpretation of this feature, it is most likely that this
feature was an in-situ hearth that consisted of a layer of ash and charcoal, overlying a thick (~15
cm) reddened thermal reaction rim that formed in the earth beneath the fire. The cross-section of
the feature suggests the reddened reaction rim was slightly more than 10 cm thick, but the slabs
made from the embedded blocks suggest it was closer to 15 cm thick, and as such is very thick for
such a feature.
Uncharacteristically, the slabbed polyester embedded block from this feature was, in some ways,
more interpretable than the thin sections, as many of the features clearly visible in the block were
often difficult to resolve in the thin sections. The dominant attribute of this block was intense
reworking of the fine-grained matrix by soil mesofauna, specifically worms. Owing to the
dramatically different color and composition of the feature deposits, the degree of faunal reworking
is much more readily observed here than in the dark grayish brown matrix that dominates the
occupation away from the feature. Bi-directional movement of the fine earth matrix is apparent in
all three thin sections made from this block. The upper-most thin section sampled vestiges of the
ash and rubified earth, and it is clear that there was once more ash in the upper part of this feature,
and much of it has been dispersed by fauna, both up and down from its original location. The intact
fragments of ash show minor reworking by fauna (in the form of inclusion of small rounded
fragments of burned earth within the ash) (see Figure 6.26, panels 3 and 4), whereas the slides from
the lower portions of the rubified reaction rim reveal an intimate mix of burned earth and
redeposited ash. Although it is difficult to estimate with confidence, it appears that more than 75
percent of this feature has been reworked by worm bioturbation. This is representative of the
degree of post-depositional bioturbation within the deposits at the site, and it is abundantly clear
why there are no sedimentary structures preserved within the deposits.
There are few clues as to how hot this feature became, but one fragment of burned earth located in
the vicinity of the ash in the upper part of the block was partially vitrified (see Figure 6.26, panels 5
Mercado Site (41TR203)

113

and 6), suggesting that this feature was quite hot at some point. Of course, the depth of the reaction
rim would also point to this as well, although it is unclear to what extent thermal saturation (the
period of time at elevated temperature) may be responsible for the very thick reddened zone under
this hearth.

Stable Carbon Isotopes

One source of paleoenvironmental information collected during the analysis of site 41TR203 is the
stable carbon isotopic composition from bulk soil organic matter. Figure 6.27 shows the results
from the four profiles analyzed with respect to the estimated ages of each sample. The results are
also shown plotted by depth below surface on Figures 6.8 through 6.11. The overall trend from
site 41TR203 is for a slight increase in organic carbon from C4 plants from the start of the record
around 2700 yr Cal BP to about 1900 years ago. With the exception of one sample from the
Control Trench at depth, the maximum contribution C4 plants observed occurs around 1900 yr Cal
BP at around 48 percent Carbon from C4 plants. After this point the trend shifts toward a
decreasing contribution in C4 to minimum values of approximately 20 to 25 percent at the top of
the site. This shift can be modeled in all profiles as a second order polynomial that suggests a
maximum C4 concentration at 1897 yr Cal BP. This regression explains over 80 percent of this
variation at the site (Figure 6.28).

Notice that although there are changes in the high-frequency variation between each profile, the
overall trend of increasing enrichment of Î´13C until approximately 2000 yr Cal BP. At that point,
there is an overall decline in Î´13C values.

Figure 6.28. Linear Regression from Each Dated Profile at Site 41TR203
Using data from site 41TR170 (Figure 6.29), a nearly identical trend in carbon isotopic signature is
3
identified (Hall et al. 2011). The isotopic data from 41TR170 was interpreted as suggesting relative
stability within the Pilot Point alluvium at near a 64 percent contribution from C4 plants. Near the
top of the West Fork Paleosol, Hall notes a shift toward a community dominated by C4 species,
which occurs after around 1000 yr Cal BP. The high values of Î´13C were interpreted as
representing a tall grass prairie vegetation within a wet meadow floodplain, with the upper shift in
Î´13C as representing a change to a drier climate with lower water tables, channel downcutting, and
invasion of dry floodplain trees (Hall 1982, 1990; Hall et al. 2011). Although the data from site
41TR203 does not compete with this interpretation, it can be seen that this shift occurs much earlier
and at a more gradual pace than was described at site 41TR170. In fact, main difference in the
dataset from sites 41TR170 and 41TR203 is a shift in Î´13C values of approximately 2.8 per mil
and a slightly older record at site 41TR203. The shift in absolute Î´13C values may be explained by
the fact that site 41TR203 occupies a lower position in the valley below the major confluence of
the Clear Fork and West Fork, while site 41TR170 is positioned over 5 mi upstream from this
confluence along the Clear Fork Trinity River. The data from site 41TR170 can also be fit with
Mercado Site (41TR203)

118

July 2019

nearly an identical regression equation with an apex at 1937 yr Cal BP and an R2 suggesting that
the regression explains over 85 percent of the data. If we take these regressions at face value, then
it is possible to state that this shift toward a drier climate is present as a regional signature
beginning at around 2000 yr Cal BP.

Figure 6.29. Four Recent Î´13C Studies from the Upper Trinity River Valley
Notice the similarities between site 41TR170 and potentially site 41TR198, which may be
reflective of a regional climatic signature. In contrast, the results from two lower-order tributaries
of the East Fork (sites 41DL203 and 41COL172) are reflective of highly localized variations.
A regional Î´13C signature is not so clear when compared with other studies in the Upper Trinity
River Valley (see Figure 6.29). The most directly comparable site is 41TR198, which is situated
along the West Fork in a similar setting as site 41TR203, with the exception that Sycamore Creek,
a small tributary, has contributed sediments to the site (Peter and Harrison 2011). The isotopic
signature from site 41TR198 was interpreted as a general increasing composition C3 vegetation
during the period of West Fork Soil formation then very slightly drier conditions occurred after this
period. However, the sampled record at site 41TR198 was much shorter than at site 41TR203, and
a regression equation does not adequately fit the sample spread. Comparing the overall trend
Mercado Site (41TR203)

119

July 2019

between the two sites suggests that there may be a comparable subtle shift in Î´13C at site 41TR198
within the West Fork Soil, but the Recent Alluvium capping the site reflects a local signature from
inputs of Sycamore Creek.
Site 41DL203 is located along a medium-sized tributary of the East Fork of the Trinity River,
Rowlett Creek (Frederick 2011). The analyzed Î´13C at that site extends back to approximately
3100 yr Cal BP, and it shows a gradual increase of organic carbon from C3 plants from the start of
the record until around 500 yr Cal BP. While the magnitude of this shift is comparable to the record
at site 41TR203, the shift is much more gradual, and it begins earlier in time than at site 41TR203.
Frederick (2009:102) attributed this character to pedogenic processes having more of an influence
on smoothing the record rather than on reflecting the regional depositional processes. At
approximately 500 yr Cal BP the record at site 41DL203 begins to swing back in favor of C4
vegetation by about 10 percent, which was interpreted as being reflective of being influenced more
by a detrital, or regional, signal than by a local or pedogenic. However, given that the other sites in
the comparative set do not show this shift, it seems equally likely that the Latest Holocene or
Recent Alluvium would be reflective of the most localized signature.
Site 41COL172 was located along Muddy Creek, a tributary of the East Fork Trinity River
(McKee 2010). This stream is located highest in the watershed of the comparative sites and is
consequently expected to contain the most locally variable signature. The sampled record does not
quite stretch back to 1000 yr Cal BP and is very highly variable from sample to sample. Overall,
there is a general trend of decreasing C4 vegetation between approximately 1000 yr Cal BP and
400 years ago and a trend back toward increasing C4 vegetation within the Recent Alluvium. This
may be subtly apparent in the data, but high-frequency variation from sample to sample results in a
poorly expressed regression. This general trend is similar to observations at site 41DL203 and
perhaps site 41TR198, with a shift toward C4 enrichment during the past 500 years. Although
Muddy Creek owes its name to its propensity for having a nearly continually saturated floodplain
during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, this does not appear to reflect a similar signature of a
wet meadow bottomland vegetation.

Discussion

The results of the geoarcheological investigations indicate that the site contains evidence of
multiple short-term prehistoric occupations of the floodplain of the Trinity River that occurred a
Mercado Site (41TR203)

120

July 2019

relatively short distance from the channel during the last three millennia. The deposits exposed by
the site excavations represent the upper part of the Pilot Point Alloformation, which was deposited
in the middle to late Holocene. A cumulic soil called the West Fork Soil generally marks the upper
part of the Pilot Point, and the excavations revealed the West Fork Soil in the top 65 cm of the
profile, and a paleosol below that between ~100 and 150 cm below the modern ground surface.
Coring during previous phase of work (Osburn et al. 2005:44) found that the Pilot Point
Alloformation here is almost 4 m thick, and they inferred that a coarser textured portion of the
deposit beneath the site was deposited as a crevasse splay on a floodplain, but the depth of these
deposits is more consistent with deposition within a meander belt setting. Regardless of the actual
depositional environment, it is clear that the site was, at least early in its history, close to the Trinity
River channel, and the presence of the Paleosol here is most likely related to the mechanics of
sedimentation within or adjacent to the meander belt.
Analysis of the aggregate sum probability age distributions for a sample of radiocarbon ages
obtained from the West Fork Soil at other sites in the region indicates that the age of the Paleosol at
site 41TR203 is consistent with the older parts of the West Fork Soil.
Statistical analysis of the radiocarbon ages from the site yielded an age-depth model that permits
assessing variations in sedimentation rate through time as well as estimating the age of various
occupations with the site deposits. Three periods of more rapid sedimentation appear to have
occurred between 2700 and 2600, 2050 and 1880, and 1450 and 1200 yr Cal BP, with slower
sedimentation rates occurring between these events. The oldest period of slower sedimentation,
between 2600 and ~2050 yr Cal BP appears to coincide with formation of the Paleosol.
Analysis of the depth variation in microartifacts recovered from three column samples, one from
each major block excavation, provide an impression of the number and age of prehistoric
occupations at the site and also provide some evidence for assessing the contextual integrity of the
occupations. At least 13 probable prehistoric occupations were noted in these samples, most of
which appear to be relatively discrete, isolable occupations. Some of these are represented by very
small amounts of cultural material, whereas there appear to be four major occupations that contain
abundant cultural material. The top 35 cm of the profile exhibits evidence of disturbance by
cultivation and the next to the lowest occupation appears to represent multiple occupations over a
long period of time and may exhibit some evidence of overprinting. Examination of a small suite of
Mercado Site (41TR203)

121

July 2019

soil micromorphology samples provided insights on several issues. Such examination of burned
earth within the next to lowest Late Archaic occupation suggests that there may have been a mud
plastered thatch-roofed building on the site at that time. Examination of samples collected from a
hearth within the same occupation revealed that worm bioturbation has been excessive and may
have contributed to the apparent compression of multiple occupations in the lowest part of the site.
Finally, documentation of the depth variation in stable carbon isotopes yielded a record of past
vegetation change similar to some of the previously published studies. Although the temporal
inflection points between these periods here appears to vary somewhat from recently published
work.
It should be noted that two lines of investigation discovered during this work may be worth
pursuing in more detail. First, during the picking and examination of the microartifact samples the
presence of numerous small snails was noted and following from other recent investigations of
Trinity River tributary deposits in this region (cf. Nickels et al. 2014), it is possible that the
identification of these snails by a malacologist may provide more details on how the floodplain
environment changed throughout the period of occupation. Second, the burned earth objects
identified in Feature 20 (and the surrounding occupation surface), which appear to be sandtempered mud, most likely represent mud plastered thatch associated with an ancient building that
today has almost negligible archeological visibility. Detailed documentation of the burned earth
objects within this assemblage (e.g., size, shape, thickness, nature of fiber impressions, and
additional petrographic examination) combined with experimentation designed to better understand
the origin and function of such material, similar to that performed at site 41DL203 (Tinsley et al.
2011) but specifically aimed at mud plastered thatch, may provide additional insights on the
creation and structural implications of such burned objects.

CHAPTER 7 â ANALYTICAL UNITS AND FEATURE DESCRIPTIONS

By: James W. Karbula, Julie Shipp, and Ruben Castillo
For the purposes of this investigation and in accordance with TxDOT standards, the excavation
data from site 41TR203 was subdivided for analysis into 8 different AUs. AUs are defined as
distinct occupational time periods that correspond with discrete periods of human activity. The
AUs were derived based on data collected during the data recovery excavations, and in particular,
the geoarcheological investigations.
7.1

Data Recovery Excavations

The data recovery excavations began with three 4 by 4-m blocks (A through C) (Figure 7.1). The
excavations were focused on three stratigraphic zones within the 1.5-m profile that contained dense
cultural material, and the deposition in between the zones was removed mechanically. Block D,
located on the east side of I-35W, was not excavated due to lack of time (Figure 7.2). Rather, aci
consulting expanded the geoarcheology trench to investigate the densest occupations identified
during the excavations.The geoarcheological trench was excavated along the east side of the data
recovery excavations, from Block A to Block C (Figure 7.1). This trench was then expanded to the
west. Block E, located in the southern part of the site, was reopened to explore the possible post
features discovered during the previous testing phase (Figure 7.3). An expedited radiocarbon
sample form Block E was sent for analysis during the field investigations, which revealed Feature
23 was modern (Beta 375548). Further investigation of Block E was abandoned. A final excavation
block, Block F, was excavated in the middle of all previous excavations (Figure 7.1). This block
was opened to explore the sheet midden comprised of AUs 7 and 8. The upper portions of the
profile were not excavated within Block F.
7.2

Geoarcheological Investigations

Given the importance of the geoarcheological investigations in determining the AUs, the following
provides a brief overview of the results of the microstratigraphic analysis authored by Frederick
and McKee (see Chapter 6). Frederick and McKeeâs analysis, which included bulk physical
properties, radiocarbon dating, micro-artifacts, and soil micromorphology, revealed 13 identifiable
occupations within a 1.5-m alluvial profile containing approximately 2,700 years of cultural
deposition. The 13 occupations vary significantly in terms of length, intensity, integrity, and
Mercado Site (41TR203)

124

July 2019

cultural features. Of the 13 occupations identified through microstratigraphy, 4 are substantial
occupations with high quantities of cultural materials and features (B, E, G, and L). These four
major occupations were identified during the field investigations and were subject to excavation at
Stratigraphic Zones I through III. The remaining nine occupations (A, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, and M)
were identified through the microstratigraphic analysis. These are more ephemeral and were not
observed as discrete occupations in the field, although excavation data was collected for five of
them (C, D, J, K, and M). Per Frederick and McKee (Chapter 6), some of the more ephemeral or
minor occupation zones have âvery small artifact occurrences and either are occupations for which
the blocks are on the edge of the occupation surface or very short duration stays.â Thus, assigning
each of the occupation zones to AUs may be a too literal interpretation of the microartifact depths,
in light of other evidence, and some of the occupations represented as distinct events in different
blocks may be the same event owing to small vagaries in sedimentation.
The physical properties identify the soil as the Pilot Point Alloformation of the Trinity River
floodplain. The Pilot Point began to form during the middle Holocene and continued until recently.
The West Fork Soil has formed in the upper portion of the Pilot Point, from the ground surface to
approximately 60 cmbs. A Paleosol formed during a time of exposure in the lower portion of the
Pilot Point from about 100 to 150 cmbs. The cultural deposits were excavated primarily from these
two soils, as depicted in Figure 7.4.
Frederick and McKee used a Bchron Package to produce an age-depth model for the site. This
exercise attempted to reconcile discrepancies in the radiocarbon dates in the upper 60 cm of the
profile. Bioturbation was noted in the field at ground surface and in the top sections of the profile,
and a distinct plow zone is present, resulting in the deposition of Historic-age artifacts up to 35
cmbs. The plow zone and bioturbation account for a significant amount of mixing in the upper
portion of the profile. The model makes it easier to compare the numerous profiles at the site, and
also to assign ages for portions of the profile that were not excavated (see Chapter 6).

AUs are initially assigned on the basis of observed and recorded divisions of cultural content,
separation in the sediments, depth below surface, calibrated radiocarbon ages, and correlated
closely to the age-sedimentation model and microartifact studies. The identification of AUs is
initially narrowly matched to the identified geoarcheological occupation zones, and both charcoal
and sediment radiocarbon ages. The AUs, as initially identified, are comprised of the four main
occupations identified through peaks in microartifacts (B, E, G, and L), calibrated radiocarbon
ages, the age-sedimentation model of the landform, and correlated depths below surface of

associated burned rock features, with the addition of five of the more ephemeral occupations (C, D,
J, K, and M) for which there is excavation data. However, this makes for eight AUs rather than
nine, because Occupations B and D were combined to create AU 1, and Occupations K and L were
combined to create AU 7 in Block C (Table 7.1). Occupation J stands on its own as AU 6. In
addition, Occupation E was split into two separate AUs because of the discrepancy in radiocarbon
dates and depths below surface. The AUs are numbered 1 through 8 from the top to bottom of the
profile.

The cultural data recovered from each AU further defines the nature of each unit. The manifestation
of AUs differs in each block. Not all AUs are present within each block, and the thickness varies
between blocks. The variation within AUs in different blocks is also due to the horizontal
expression of the site, such as the topography at the time of occupation and the location of activity
areas. The AUs are evaluated in relation to the excavation zones, in that they date to three primarily
different periods throughout the occupations of the Late Holocene. The cultural features and artifact
types that are present within each AU reflect apparent changes through time in subsistence
strategies and possibly the intensity or duration of the occupations.
AUs 1 through 3 date to the Late Prehistoric period, with a range of 1530 to 930 yr Cal BP. AU 2
contained a simple hearth feature. AU 1 contained a burned rock midden. AU 3 is characterized by
small hearth features and faunal material. In AUs 1 through 3, only eight flakes and two formal

Mercado Site (41TR203)

130

July 2019

stone tools were recovered. Yet, over 1,200 faunal elements were recovered from AUs 1 through 3
and were concentrated in AU 3. Faunal elements consist primarily of small, unidentified mammal
bone fragments along with several positive identifications of white-tailed deer. AUs 4 and 5 date to
a Transitional Archaic period (1710 to 1415 yr Cal BP). AU 4 is characterized by mussel shell
middens and few artifacts (four uniface fragments, eight flakes, and 57 pieces of bone, including
deer).
AU 5 contained one rock midden (Feature 15) and three pit features (Features 16, 17, and 31) along
with 14 pieces of debitage and 54 fauna fragments. AUs 6 through 8 are Late Archaic occupations
(2760 to 2145 yr Cal BP), and this lower portion of the site is composed of a sheet midden with
abundant mussel shell, burned rock, lithics, burned clay, and faunal material, including bison. The
collection of stone tools and debitage from AUs 6 through 8 includes 20 stone tools, approximately
350 pieces of debitage, and nearly 6,000 faunal elements.
Through detailed examination of AUs 1 through 8 (see below), it becomes apparent that site
41TR203 can be meaningfully evaluated in terms of three main prehistoric sociocultural intervals
in the north-central Texas regional chronology: Late Archaic, Transitional Archaic, and Late
Prehistoric. This may be best achieved by examining multiple and additional lines of archeological
data, by AU, and by features and artifacts recorded within AUs, within the overall framework of
the geoarcheological model. These include 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon ages from feature
contexts, faunal and stone tool associations, depth below surface, and feature morphology within
the context of the intact and nearly pristine terrace sediments, and the presence of the deeply buried
paleosol (see Chapter 10). This explains in part, the observed overlap in radiocarbon ages, cultural
content, feature morphologies, organics, and stone tool assemblages observed between different
groupings of AUs (see below and Chapter 10).
7.3

Contextual Integrity

The site maintained a high degree of contextual integrity at the time of the excavations. The
sedimentation rates obtained from the age-depth model demonstrate how periods of more rapid
sedimentation preserved the occupations that occurred on the more stable surfaces formed during
times of slower sedimentation. There are, however, some exceptions to the otherwise ideal alluvial

Mercado Site (41TR203)

131

July 2019

deposition, including disturbances from post-depositional processes and some mixing of
occupations within the Paleosol.
The post-depositional disturbances are primarily from plowing. Bioturbation from tree roots or
rodents was not common in the excavation profiles below 30 cmbs and was primarily present in the
upper 30 cm of the profile. The plow zone consists of the top approximately 30 cm of the profile,
although it is as shallow as 20 cm in some places, as evidenced by intact hearth features located at
20 cmbs. Historic and prehistoric artifacts were mixed within the plow zone, and it is difficult to
discern the level of disturbance of the prehistoric components in the uppermost portion from
plowing (see Chapter 6). Furthermore, the surface may have been graded during the construction of
the West Fork Trinity River flood zone, which includes a levee system.
AUs 6 through 8, in the lower portion of the profile, are located within the Paleosol, which formed
when sedimentation rates slowed between 2600 and 2050 yr Cal BP. The slower sedimentation
coupled with more frequent and/or denser occupations likely caused some mixing of cultural
material from multiple occupations. AU 6 in particular appeared in the field as the most artifactdense occupation, when in fact it may represent several smaller occupations over a period of
approximately 600 years.
The assignment and location description of each AU is discussed in more detail below. The
discussion includes a brief description of the features that were excavated in each AU with
associated calibrated radiocarbon ages. All artifact types were present within each unit, and include
burned rock, charcoal, lithics, burned clay, and faunal material. However, it should be noted that
portions of AU 3, all of AU 4, and portions of AU 5 primarily contained mussel shell. See Table
7.1 for a summary of the occupations and depths of the AUs. Table 7.2 summarizes radiocarbon
ages with 2-sigma calibrations by feature, sediment zone, and AU. Table 7.3 summarizes
associated radiocarbon dates from bone collagen.

Analytical Unit Descriptions

This section includes more detailed descriptions of the AUs that represent distinct occupational
time periods of site 41TR203 and the feature and artifacts attributed to each. The descriptions are
presented first, followed by associated figures. Figures 7.5 through 7.7 correlate 2-sigma calibrated
radiocarbon ages from the site with the proposed ages of the geoarcheology investigations. Figures
7.8 through 7.15 show an overview of the excavations and highlights features associated with each
AU, culminating with Figure 7.16, which maps all features discussed within the AUs.
7.4.1

Analytical Unit 1

(1280 to 970 yr Cal BP)
AU 1 was at 10 to 35 cmbs, ranging from elevations of 99.97 to 99.72, and was beneath (and
possibly truncated by) the plow zone. This AU correlates with Strat Zone I in Block B. Occupations
B and D were both incorporated into AU 1, as were the deposits 5 cm above Occupation B and the
10 cm in between B and D (Figure 7.6). Occupation B was one of the main occupations, and D was
one of the ephemeral occupations. The radiocarbon dates from features also suggest that AU 1
likely represents more than one occupation.
The majority of the features in AU 1 were small hearths with a significant amount of deer and other
associated faunal material. The most distinctive feature of AU 1 is a burned rock midden
(Feature 10) (Figure 7.8). During the excavations, the midden was bisected and was found to be
basin- shaped, with good preservation of wood charcoal, including one large (20-cm-long) piece of
wood that remained within the center of the midden. Five radiocarbon dates were obtained for the
midden from charred samples of oak, elm, cherry, unidentified hardwood. The dates range from
1280 to 970 yr Cal BP (Betas 399610, 396611, 396612, 396615, 396616) (see Table 7.3). Feature 8
was excavated during the testing phase, but it also was located adjacent to Zone I in Block A and
thus, correlates with AU 1. Feature 8 was a hearth feature with abundant faunal material, primarily
deer.
One unifacial fragment, four pieces of debitage (three 1/4-inch flakes and one 1-inch flake),
88 macrobotanical remains, and 38 faunal elements are attributed to AU 1.

7.4.2

Analytical Unit 2

(1530 to 1380 yr Cal BP)
AU 2 was beneath the plow zone, from 20 to 40 cmbs, ranging in elevations from 99.81 to 99.61.
This component correlates with Strat Zone I in Block C and with Occupation C (Figure 7.7).
Occupation C was also recorded with Block A and was 5 cm thick in both blocks (Figure 7.5).
However, AU 2/Occupation C was not observed during the scraping of Block A and thus, there is
not excavation data for the AU within Block A. AU 2 is 20 cm thick in Block C and was expanded
by 15 cm to include the excavation data above and below the occupation as identified from the
microartifact analysis.
The excavation focused on the eastern portion of the block, around Feature 12 (Figure 7.9).
Feature 12 was a hearth that consisted of eight burned limestone cobbles. Faunal remains, mussel
shell, burned rock, burned earth, charcoal, and lithics were present within this component, but were
not abundant. A radiocarbon sample from a charred piece of oak wood yielded a date of 1530 to
1380 yr Cal BP (Beta 396608) (see Table 7.3). The radiocarbon samples from the geoarcheological
investigation yielded a date of about 1200 yr Cal BP.
One blade-flake fragment, three pieces of debitage (one 1/4-inch flake and two 1-inch flakes), 11
macrobotanical remains, and 10 faunal elements are attributed to AU 2.
7.4.3

Analytical Unit 3

(1055 to 930 yr Cal BP)
AU 3 correlates with Strat Zone I in Block A and was at 35 to 50 cmbs, ranging in elevation from
99.81 to 99.66 (Figure 7.5). Occupation E was only expanded by 5 cm to incorporate the excavated
material and to create AU 3.
Feature 13 was excavated within Block A and is a hearth feature that consisted of three overlying
courses of rock (Figure 7.10). Many of the rocks appeared thermally fractured and in-situ. A
significant amount of burned clay and charcoal were present. A piece of red oak charcoal from
Feature 13 was dated to 1055 to 930 yr Cal BP (Beta 396613) (see Table 7.3).

Mercado Site (41TR203)

136

July 2019

No stone tools, one piece of debitage (one 3/4-inch flake), four macrobotanical remains, and over
1,225 faunal pieces are attributed to AU 3.
7.4.4

Analytical Unit 4

(1710 to 1415 yr Cal BP)
AU 4 correlates with Strat Zone II in Block B and was 40 to 60 cmbs, ranging in elevation from
99.67 to 99.47 (Figure 7.6). Occupation E was only expanded by 5 cm to incorporate the excavated
material and to create AU 4.
Feature 21 was a mussel shell midden that was located along the southern wall of Block B and
appeared to continue beyond the wall (Figure 7.11). The portion of the shell midden that was
visible within the excavated block measured approximately 1 m north to south, 2 m east to west,
and 10 cm thick. A radiocarbon sample from a charred piece of ash wood yielded a date of 1710 to
1560 yr Cal BP (Beta 396629) (see Table 7.3). This feature is similar to Feature 14, excavated from
Block C and AU 5. Both features are mussel shell middens, and the only features excavated that
date to the Transitional Archaic period.
Features 25 through 28 were excavated from the geoarcheology trench. Feature 25, 26, and 28 were
shell middens, which are prevalent in this AU. Feature 27 was a pit feature that was also excavated
from the geoarcheology trench with a significant amount of burned clay and charcoal.
A total of four unifacial fragments, eight pieces of debitage (two 1/4-inch flakes and six 3/4-inch
flakes), 75 macrobotanical remains, and 29 faunal elements are attributed to AU 4.
7.4.5

Analytical Unit 5

(1815 to 1570 yr Cal BP)
AU 5 correlates with Strat Zone II in Block C (Figure 7.7). AU 5 was 45 to 75 cmbs, at elevations
ranging from 99.56 to 99.26. Occupation G was expanded 10 cm above and 5 cm below the range
defined during the geoarcheological analysis. Occupation G/AU 5 was also present in Block A, but
was not observed during the mechanical scraping and thus, was not excavated within this block
(Figure 7.5).

Mercado Site (41TR203)

137

July 2019

The focus of excavations in AU 5 was around Feature 14, which was a mussel shell midden that
extended into the northern wall of the block (Figure 7.12). The excavated portion of Feature 14 was
approximately 3 m east to west, 1.5 m north to south, and 10 cm thick. Two radiocarbon samples
from charred pieces of elm and unidentified hardwood yielded dates of 1720 to 1570 yr Cal BP
(Beta 396618) and 1815 to 1615 yr Cal BP (Beta 396617), respectively (see Table 7.3). Feature 14
in AU 5 is similar to and dates to roughly the same interval as Feature 21, excavated from AU 4.
Features 15 through 17 and Feature 31 were excavated with the geoarcheology trench. Feature 15
was a rock midden, and Features 16, 17, and 31 were pits. Features 1 and 5 from the testing phase
correlate with AU 5 and were hearth features.
No stone tools, 14 pieces of debitage (six 1/4-inch flakes, six 3/4-inch flakes, and two 1-inch
flakes), 54 macrobotanical remains, and 54 faunal elements are attributed to AU 5.
7.4.6

Analytical Unit 6

(2760 to 2145 yr Cal BP)
AU 6 correlates with the top of Strat Zone III in Block A (Figure 7.5). AU 6 was 90 to 100 cmbs, at
elevations ranging from 99.26 to 99.16. Occupation J was expanded 5 cm to include the
excavations above the occupation. Occupation J/AU 6 was also in Blocks B and C, but because of
its ephemeral nature, was not observed with the other blocks during the mechanical scraping and
thus, was not excavated in those blocks (Figures 7.6 and 7.7).
Features 18 and 19, excavated in this AU, were hearth features defined by a concentration of
burned rock, although burned rock was prevalent throughout the zone (Figure 7.13). The features
contained all artifact types, namely burned rock, burned earth, mussel shell, lithics, bone, and
mussel charcoal. Two radiocarbon dates from charred pieces of hardwood collected from Feature
18 yielded ages of 2345 to 2295 yr Cal BP (Beta 396632) and 2325 to 2145 yr Cal BP (Beta
396634) (see Table 7.3).
Feature 30 was excavated from within the geoarcheology trench, and its spatial location correlates
with AU 6. This feature was a hearth.

Mercado Site (41TR203)

138

July 2019

One biface fragment, two pieces of debitage (one 1/4-inch flake and one 1-inch flake), 27
macrobotanical remains, and 67 faunal elements are attributed to AU 6.
7.4.7

Analytical Unit 7

(2720 to 2350 yr Cal BP)
AU 7 correlates to Strat Zone III in all blocks, and Occupation L from the geoarcheological
analysis (Fiugres 7.5, 7.6, and 7.7). AU 7 was 105 to 130 cmbs, at elevations ranging from 99.11 to
98.76, depending on the excavation block. AU 7 was characterized by an extensive sheet midden
containing faunal material, mussel shell, burned rock, burned earth, lithics, and charcoal. The
midden was the densest in Block A but was present in all blocks. Additional features consisted of a
few discrete ring hearths comprised of burned limestone that contained faunal remains. Lithic
materials, which were relatively scarce at the site, were most prevalent in this AU, and several dart
points were recovered from AUs 7 and 8.
AU 7 was the most productive component at the site and is most likely a series of occupations that
occurred over a period of approximately 400 to 500 years. AU 7 comprises the majority of Strat
Zone III, and the excavations were 20 to 35 cm thick. The cultural deposits within this component
resulted in the formation of a sheet midden that consisted of various faunal materials, mussel shell,
burned rock, burned earth, charcoal, and lithics. The abundance of faunal material was particularly
notable in comparison to other units and included bison bone and teeth as well as teeth and bones
from a variety of smaller fauna.
Additionally, sand was observed within pieces of burned earth during the soil micromorphological
analysis of this component. The sand is not present within the matrix and appears to have been
intentionally added. This suggests there could have been some sort of mud-plastered structure at the
site during this occupation or perhaps the burned clay was used as boiling stones. Both of these
hypotheses have been suggested for sites similar to site 41TR203.
Fourteen features (Features 6, 29, 32 through 41, 43, and 44) were located within the sheet midden
defined in AU 7, including Block F and the geomorphic trench (Figure 7.14). The features were
either basin-shaped hearths or pit features with highly burned reaction rims, indicating that these
features may have been used as ovens. The features were heavily burned and contained substantial

Mercado Site (41TR203)

amounts of ash with a few pieces of burned rock in the bottom. The sheet midden may be a result
of cleaning out these ovens.
Features 34 through 41, 43, and 44 were excavated from AU 7 in Block F. Features 35 through 39
and 43 were hearth features, and Features 34 and 44 were pits that were less well-defined but may
also have served as hearths as discussed above. Feature 40 was a small shell midden that may
simply have been a particularly dense concentration of shells, for it was not nearly as large or
clearly defined as the mussel shell middens from AU 4. Feature 41 was a dense concentration of
artifacts including in-situ burned earth. A charred piece of cherry wood from this feature yielded a
date of 2720 to 2430 yr Cal BP (Beta 396624) (see Table 7.3). Feature 43 was a hearth feature that
also appeared to exhibit in-situ burned earth. A radiocarbon date from an indeterminate piece of
charred material yielded a date of 2680 to 2640 yr Cal BP (Beta 396623) (see Table 7.3).
Features 29, 32, and 33 were excavated from the geoarcheology trench, and their spatial location
correlates them with AU 7. These were hearth features. Feature 6 from the testing phase is also in
AU 7 and was a pit feature.
A total of 13 stone tools including Gary Late Archaic projectile point forms and uniface and biface
fragments, as well as 316 pieces of debitage (117 1/4-inch flakes, 24 1/2-inch flakes, 92 3/4-inch
flakes, and 83 1-inch flakes), 242 macrobotanical remains, and 4,474 faunal elements are attributed
to AU 7.
7.4.8

Analytical Unit 8

(2740 to 2355 yr Cal BP)
AU 8 is stratigraphically situated beneath AU 7, at the bottom of Strat Zone III (Figures 7.5, 7.6,
and 7.7). It was the deepest stratigraphic unit excavated at the site, from 125 to 145 cmbs, ranging
in elevations from 98.70 to 98.56, depending on the excavation block.
Feature 20 was the most productive hearth feature excavated in Block A (Figure 7.15). The feature
was a limestone hearth in a roughly circular pattern. The rocks ranged from 3 to 12 cm in size and
were flat to subangular. Faunal materials, including bison teeth and a bison scapula, mussel shell,
charcoal, and burned earth were collected from within the feature. Two radiocarbon dates were
processed from the feature. A sample of charred white oak yielded a date of 2715 to 2360 yr Cal

BP (Beta 396625), and a sample of burned cherry wood was calibrated to 2700 to 2635 yr Cal BP
(Beta 396626) (see Table 7.3).
Features 24 and 42 were excavated within AU 8. Feature 24 was a hearth feature with a dense
concentration of ash and burned earth. Two soil micromorphology samples were taken from
Feature 24, one from the feature and one from the surface outside of the feature. These samples
demonstrated an unusually thick thermal reaction rim and vitrification near the top of the features.
A sample of charred hickory or pecan wood from the feature yielded dates of 2700 to 2355 yr Cal
BP (Beta 396620) (see Table 7.3).
Feature 42 was located in Block F and consisted of eight large cobbles arranged in a disarticulated
circular shape. Cultural materials associated with the feature included a few faunal remains and
lithic material. There was a noticeable amount of sedimentation between Components IIIb and IIIc
of about 20 cm within Block F. Components IIIb and IIIc conformed in the other blocks. A date of
2740 to 2490 yr Cal BP was obtained from a charred piece of hardwood from Feature 42 (Beta
396637).
Five stone tools including Gary and Ensor Late Archaic projectile point forms, 31 flakes (nine 1/4inch flakes, three 1/2-inch flakes, ten 3/4-inch flakes, and nine 1-inch flakes), 80 macrobotanical
remains, and 2,261 faunal elements are attributed to AU 8.

Description
Feature 8 was originally observed and only excavated during the NRHP testing phase as a lens of FCR and mussel shell in the east wall
of Backhoe Trench (BHT) 2 at approximately 20â30 cmbs (100.06â99.74; see Table 7.4), immediately below the plow zone. A 1-x-1-m
excavation unit (Unit 7) was established to the east of the BHT. The same vertical datum used for Unit 1 was also used for Unit 7. The
feature consisted of a cluster of FCR with small amounts of charcoal and baked earth. Several mammal bone fragments were also
present within the FCR cluster. The feature appears to be limited to a lens between approximately 34 and 46 cmbd. A flotation sample of feature fill was taken from each 10-cm excavation level, and samples were also taken of the soil from outside the feature. Just
west of the FCR cluster and at a slightly lower elevation were several fragments of animal bone. Below the animal bone, by 56 cmbs,
the soil matrix was devoid of cultural material. This feature may represent a small hearth with a collection of discarded animal bones
nearby, or it may represent an area where both FCR and animal bones were discarded.

Description
Feature 10 was originally located during NRHP testing and excavated during the data recovery phase from the walls and floor of the
northern end of BHT 16 (see Table 7.4 ). A dense concentration of burned rock was noted in both walls and the floor of the trench.
The feature was at a depth of 20â50 cmbs (99.83â99.70) and was still present in the floor when trenching was ceased. The density,
size, arrangement, and presence of a basin lined with larger, unfractured rocks, along with organic remains, suggest that Feature 10
is an earth oven with its lower heating elements still intact. Excavation Block B was opened around this feature during data recovery. The feature is a dense concentration of FCR located just underneath the plow zone. The top of the feature was likely disturbed
and partially truncated by plowing and from the discovery of the feature by machine.
Feature 10 is a roughly oval basined pit that measures 140 cm northâsouth by 120 eastâwest, and is 15 cm thick. The feature was bi
sected along its northâsouth axis, between Units 25 and 29 to the west, and to the west of Units 26 and 30. Excavation was in 10 cm
levels in Units 25 and 29 and was expediently removed from Units 26 and 30. All soil matrices and FCR were collected, along with 11
point-plotted FCR from the top of the feature within Unit 25. A total of 426 FCR weighing 61.93 kg was collected, making this the
largest burned rock feature. The cross-section showed the feature to consist of a shallow basin containing a dense, compact layer of
large FCR representing the basal rock heating elements of an earth oven. FCR and burnt earth nodules in Units 30 and 31 appeared to
represent the partial clean-out of the feature. Charcoal flecking was ubiquitous, and large pieces of charred branches were located at
the bottom of the basin (76 charcoal remains in total). Additionally, 12 macrobotanical remains (carbonized plants) and 10 faunal
specimens were collected, including one from a small bird (dove, plover, screech owl size), two from a small mammal (rabbit, prairie
dog, or squirrel size), and seven from miscellaneous vertebrates.

Description
Feature 12 was a small hearth or possible discard pile of FCR and other cultural materials located during mechanical scraping in Block
C between 29 and 39 cmbs (99.7â99.6). The feature was approximately 50 cm in diameter, and was excavated within Units 47 and 51,
in 10 cm levels but not bisected. The feature consisted of eight large cobbles in a ring, none of which were overlapping. One medium
to large mammal (deer to pronghorn size) bone, 11 charcoal remains, and one unidentified mussel shell were collected from the feature.

Description
Feature 13 was a small, basined hearth or earth oven located during mechanical scraping in Block A at a depth of 29â46 cmbs
(99.87â99.70; see Table 7.4). The feature was in a figure 8 shape, approximately 80 cm in diameter and 15 cm thick. The feature
was excavated in Unit 10 in 10-cm levels but not bisected. A dense cluster of approximately 50 FCR was fractured in situ in two and
three flat layers. The basined nature, the bed of larger rocks in the lower basin, and the loose smaller FCR covering the lower bed
are suggestive of a small earth oven. The loose smaller rocks may represent lid rocks from the upper elements of a small-sized
oven. Alternatively, the remains of a small hearth feature may be indicated. Four charcoal remains, one unidentified mussel
shell, and burned clay were collected from the feature, along with one lithic flake, Â¾-inch in size. A piece of historic glass was collected from the first excavation level, indicating that the top of the feature may have been truncated or partially mixed with the
bottom of the plow zone.

Description
Feature 21 was a mussel shell midden located during mechanical scraping in Block B at a depth of 53 cmbs (99.59; see Table 7.4).
The feature was excavated in 10 cm levels from Units 37 and 38. Amorphous in shape, the feature dimensions were approximately
1 m northâ south and 2 m eastâwest, although the feature extended into the south wall of the excavation block and so the extent
of the size and shape is unknown. A large round area in the middle of the feature did not contain mussel shell; the shape is vaguely
amorphous and may be a possible indicator that a textile or mat may have been used to carry and place the cooked ingredients and
then removed afterward. The analyzed shells from Feature 21 consisted of 72 Fusconaia sp., 40 Pleurombemini, 27 Cyclonaias
mortoni, 22 Pleurobema riddelli, 13 Amblema plicata, five gastropods, three Plectomerus dombeyanus, three Quadrula sp., one
Lampsilis teres, one Quadrula apiculata, one Tritigonia verrucosa, one Truncilla truncata, and 36 unidentified mollusks. Additionally, four pieces of debitage (two Â¼-inch flakes and two Â¾-inch flakes), and four macrobotanical remains (three charcoal and one
carbonized plant) were present within the feature.

Description
Feature 1 was first observed by archeologists from SWCA during their 2009 backhoe trenching work at site 41TR203. At that time,
the archeologists photographed and documented the feature, covered it with orange safety fencing, and backfilled the trench. aci
archeologists relocated the trench based on the map provided by SWCA and used a backhoe to carefully remove the fill from above
the feature level during the NRHP testing phase. The feature was located at a depth of approximately 50 cmbs (99.43) and is composed of a cluster of FCR (see Table 7.4). Once the feature had been re-exposed, archeologists from aci laid out a 1-x-1-m excavation unit (Unit 1), oriented to the cardinal directions, centered over the feature. A vertical datum was set at 10 cm above the
surface. The unit was excavated in 10-cm levels, and all fill was screened through Â¼-in mesh. A 10-cm level in the eastern half of
the unit outside the feature was excavated first, leaving the feature intact. After the intact feature was documented
through a sketch map and photographs, the feature was bisected, and the upper 10 cm of the eastern half of the feature was removed. A portion of the feature fill was set aside as a sample for flotation, and the rest was screened for the presence of artifacts.
This process was repeated for the second 10-cm level outside of the feature and then inside the eastern portion of the feature. By
the end of the second 10-cm level, the feature had disappeared. The profile of the feature was not distinctive. The excavation
process was repeated on the western side of the unit, outside the feature and then inside the feature in 10-cm levels.
Feature 1 consisted of a roughly circular cluster of FCR measuring approximately 60 cm in diameter. The northwestern corner of the
excavation unit also contained two fragments of FCR from the same elevations as the feature. Two other FCR fragments to the east of
the feature may also be associated. The upper elevation of the cluster was approximately 50 cmbs (60 cmbd), while the lower eleva
tion was approximately 64 cmbs. The feature contained 20â25 larger cobbles and 20â30 small fragments. A few clumps of baked clay
were found within the feature, but the soil within the feature did not differ significantly from that outside of the feature. The feature
is interpreted to be a small hearth, or possible rake-out discard pile. The matrix from outside the feature yielded 10â15 small mam
mal bones and bone fragments, several of which were whole rodent bones.

Description
Feature 5 was excavated during NRHP testing phase in the west wall of BHT 11 as a cluster of FCR at approximately 55 cmbs (see
Table 7.4). A 1-x-1-m excavation unit (Unit 3) was established over the feature after the upper 25 cm of overburden had been mechanically removed. A vertical datum was established at 10 cm above the surface. Only the eastern half of the unit was excavated.
The upper 30 cm of fill were removed quickly in 10-cm levels and screened through Â¼-in mesh, but no cultural material was recovered. At approximately 55 cmbs (65 cmbd), the cluster of FCR was exposed. Some charcoal and baked earth were observed in association with the FCR. Two bone fragments were also recovered from the soil matrix between 65 and 75 cmbd. A sample of feature fill
was removed for flotation analysis. No evidence of the feature was found below 65 cmbs (75 cmbd). The feature is interpreted to be
a small hearth, or possible rake-out discard pile.

Description
Feature 14 was a mussel shell midden located during mechanical scraping in Block C at a depth of 53â65 cmbs (99.48â99.37; see Table 7.4). The excavated part of the feature was amorphous in shape and measured approximately 3 m eastâwest by 1.5 m
northâsouth and 20 cm thick. However, the northern portion of the feature extended into the northern wall of the excavation block
and was not excavated, thus the full feature size is unknown. The feature was excavated from within Units 41, 42, 43, 46, and 47. The
mussel shells were primarily one and two layers thick. One FCR specimen weighing 0.08 kg was collected from Feature 14. A total of
15 faunal specimens from one snake (Serpentes), one cottontail (Sylvilagus sp.), one deer (Odocoileus sp.), one deer or pronghorn
(medium to large Artiodactyla), one deer or pronghorn (medium to large mammal size), nine miscellaneous mammals, and one miscellaneous vertebrate were analyzed. Sixteen Fusconaia sp., 16 Pleurobemini, 10 Pleurobema riddelli, five Amblema plicata, two
Plectomerus dombeyanus, two Cyclonaias mortoni, two Truncilla truncate, one Tritigonia verrucosa, one gastropod, and seven
unidentifiable mollusk shells were analyzed. Eleven pieces of charcoal were also observed and collected, as well as one piece of
debitage, 1/4-inch in size.

Description
Feature 6 was a cluster of FCR with smears of charcoal and baked earth initially observed in the floor of BHT 2 at approximately 115
cmbs and excavated during the NRHP testing phase (98.91; see Table 7.4). A 1-x-1-m excavation unit (Unit 4) was established over
the feature, and a vertical datum was established at 10 cm above the surface. Due to space constraints, the unit was aligned parallel
to the BHT rather than to the cardinal directions. The crew carefully removed matrix from around the visible FCR and then from
around mussel shell and areas of baked earth and charcoal, leaving as much cultural material in place as was possible. Matrix was
screened through Â¼-in mesh, and all cultural material found in the screen were collected. Between 122 and 130 cmbd, 41 individual
articles were mapped and collected as point-plotted items. Mapped materials included FCR, mussel shell, baked earth, and charcoal.
At 130 cmbd, very few artifacts were still present in the unit, and no artifacts were present below 134 cmbd. The feature extent, difficult to determine when the Unit 4 was established, proved to encompass the northwest, northeast, and southeast quadrants of
the excavation unit; very little material was present in the southwest quadrant. The feature appears to represent a discard pile of
food remains and cooking debris (FCR, ash, bone, and charcoal). The FCR did not appear to reflect the kind of pattern that would
be expected of a hearth or oven feature.

However, the field bag was lost after being checked into the aci laboratory. Artifacts in Feature 29 included 51 primary flakes, the
majority of which were Edwards chert, that appeared to be a cache of flakes. The feature could be the result of a single knapping
episode.â Additionally, 21 large mammal (bison or elk size) bones were excavated in Feature 29 and analyzed, along with eight
macrobotanical remains (charcoal), and one piece of debitage measuring Â¾-inch in diameter. No further information is available on
the feature from aci records.

Description
Feature 35 was first observed as a loose scatter of seven burned rock weighing 1.02 kg after scraping down to excavations in Block F
(see Table 7.4). The feature was excavated within Unit 67, and was round, 50 cm in diameter, and 10 cm thick. Feature 35 was bisected, and half of the feature was collected.
The burned rock was in a ring shape, and contained lithic debris and mussel shell. Some burned rock and bone were scattered outside of the feature as well. A 20-cm-long area of burnt earth (similar to the one outside of Feature 20.1) was sampled for soil
micromorphology. The entire piece of burnt earth was collected. It appears that the burned rocks and burnt earth were removed
from within the feature, as the center is empty except for some burnt earth nodules and a few shells. Cultural materials recovered
from this feature include eight macrobotanical remains (charcoal), one quartzite biface fragment (SN211.01) and nine pieces
of debitage, (one Â¼-inch flake, one Â½-inch flake, three Â¾-inch flakes, and four 1-inch flakes). Feature 35 may represent the remains
of a rockless cooking pit, or alternatively, an amorphous area of cultural discard, part of a sheet midden of cultural debris scattered over a larger area on a relatively stable geomorphic surface, over a lengthy period of time.

Description
Feature 36 was a burned rock feature located during mechanical scraping in Block F and excavated within Unit 63 (98.95; see Table
7.4). The feature was small, approximately 45 cm northâ south by 35 cm eastâwest and 10 cm thick, and consisted of at least three
rocks averaging 10 cm in diameter with some smaller fragments. The entire feature was collected in one bag. The rocks were in a
cluster with few overlapping, but no distinct layers were apparent. There was not enough rock to define a shape. Burned clay was
located throughout, and the feature also contained two pieces of lithic debitage (one Â¼-inch flake and one 1-inch flake), four
macrobotanical remains (charcoal), and mussel shell. The feature may represent a discard pile from nearby cooking or baking activities.

Description
Feature 20.1 was a burned rock feature (possibly a hearth) containing a concentration of artifacts within an occupation zone with a
dense artifact scatter. The feature was excavated from Block A, within Units 18, 19, 22, and 23 at 110â117 cmbs (99.06â98.99; see
Table 7.4). Feature 20.1 measured approximately 135 cm northâsouth, 115 cm eastâwest, and 10 cm thick. Most of the rocks were
in one layer, some in two layers, and varied from 3 to 12 cm in size. Some of the rocks were fractured in situ. The profile was a very
shallow basin, almost flat. One Cyclonaias mortoni and one unidentified mollusk shell were analyzed from this feature. The 187
faunal remains included eight bison (Bison bison), two probable bison (cf. Bison), eight large Bovidae (bison), one medium-large or
large mammal, 146 large mammals (bison or elk size), nine miscellaneous mammal, and 13 miscellaneous vertebrate remains.
Charcoal was also observed and collected. Feature 20.1 may represent an intact hearth feature or earth oven basal remnant with
an associated lid rock or rake-out pile immediately adjacent.

Description
Feature 4 was originally observed as a concentration of charcoal, ash, and baked soil in the west wall of BHT 10 at approximately 84
cmbs during NRHP testing. The feature was then excavated during the data recovery phase. A 1-x-1-m excavation unit (Unit 2) was
established over the feature, with the west wall of BHT 10 creating the east wall of the excavation unit. A vertical datum was
established at 10 cm above the surface. The upper 50 cm of overburden was removed mechanically, and hand excavation began at
that level. Only the eastern half of the unit was excavated, and the fill was screened through Â¼-in mesh. No cultural material was
recovered from above 90 cmbd. One clump of baked soil was recovered from between 90 and 100 cmbd. The fill around the feature
was excavated in 5-cm levels, but no artifacts were present. The feature measured approximately 45 cm northâsouth by 25 cm eastâ
west. Charcoal samples were removed for radiocarbon dating and species analysis. Excavation was terminated at 110 cmbd, and the
feature was covered with several layers of material for preservation. Feature 4 was initially thought to be prehistoric posts but was
later found to be historic. Associated Features 7, 22, and 23 appeared to be in an arc pattern of an approximate 4.5-m radius located
in Block E. An expedited radiocarbon sample was sent for analysis during the field investigations. The results of this analysis were that
Feature 23 was modern (Beta 375548). TxDOT and the THC concurred with the abandonment of Block E, and the feature was not
investigated further.

Description
Feature 7, like Feature 4, was observed in BHT 10 during NRHP testing. The expansion and establishment of excavation units within
BHT 10 was instituted to determine whether other features similar to Feature 4 existed in context with each other. The presence of
such features would lend weight to the hypothesis that Feature 4 was a prehistoric post. Mechanical excavation of overburden approximately 2 meters to the east of Feature 4 led to the discovery of three amorphous clusters of charcoal at 90 cmbs. The largest of
which measured to about 9 cm in diameter. Feature 7, later, was covered with material and abandoned to be investigated in the future.

Feature 11 was a mussel shell midden in BHT 19, one of four trenches that were excavated on the east side of the highway during the
NRHP testing. The feature was originally noted as about five pieces of burned rock in the east wall BHT 19 at approximately 60
cmbs. A 50-cm shovel test was situated over the rocks and was excavated from the surface. A mussel shell midden was then located over the burned rock at approximately 45 cmbs. The shells were present throughout the shovel test and concentrated in the
southeast corner. The feature did not appear to extend into the trench and was not present in the west wall of the trench. Feature
11 was covered and was not excavated during the NRHP testing or data recovery phase.

A total of 8,346 vertebrate faunal remains were recovered from the Mercado site (41TR203) during
data recovery by aci consulting (Table 8.1). Site 41TR203, located along the West Fork of the
Trinity River, is a multicomponent site containing Late Archaic, Transitional Archaic, and Late
Prehistoric occupations. The entire vertebrate faunal assemblage was examined. The present
analysis forms the basis for addressing several research issues relating to this assemblage, such as
species variability, human subsistence strategies, taphonomic processes, and the cultural use of
bone. Specific vertebrate faunal research questions developed for data recovery include:
1. Do the changes in faunal assemblages reflect changes in C3 and C4 ecosystems?
2. Are there a significant number of bison remains?
3. How does the number of bison compare to other open prairie style species?
4. Do grassland changes appear to have affected the presence of bison?
5. Do any specimens exhibit cut marks?
6. Do cut marks or other data indicate that the animals were butchered on site or were brought
to the site from elsewhere?
7. Do the various species reflect a broad-spectrum diet?
8. Do the vertebrate faunal remains reflect a specialized use of the site?
9. Does the assemblage suggest seasonal occupation of the site? If so, do the AUs reflect
changes in seasonality?
10. Do the concentrations of faunal remains reflect different processing activities?
11. Is there evidence of bone grease processing?
12. Were any of the rock features used for boiling bones to produce bone grease?
13. Was the site near the kill sites of the animals and used as an initial processing site, or does
the evidence suggest a post-processing site? Does this differ between AUs?
The following descriptions and discussions focus on the AUs and features, then on the vertebrate
faunal assemblage as a whole, allowing for intra-site comparison within a temporal framework.
The discussion begins with a description of the research methods used in this study. This is

Research Methods

The faunal identifications were made by Jodi Jacobson, with the aid of her personal comparative
collection and specimens on loan from the University of Tennessee, Department of Anthropology,
Vertebrate Comparative Skeletal Collection. In addition, published osteological references

Mercado Site (41TR203)

214

July 2019

(Balkwill and Cumbaa 1992; Ford 1990; Jacobson 2004; Olsen 1964, 1968) were consulted. All
vertebrate faunal remains recovered from 1/4-inch screening of excavated deposits and from
flotation heavy fraction were analyzed. No faunal sampling was conducted. Basic information
recorded for each specimen, a complete bone or tooth or a fragment thereof, included the taxon,
element, laterality, portion, weathering, burning, gnawing, and evidence of butchering and
working.
Taxonomic classification follows Page and Burr (1991) for fish, Stebbins (2003) for reptiles and
amphibians, Peterson (1988) for birds, and Schmidly (1994) for mammals. Taxonomic
identifications were made to the lowest level of specificity (e.g., order, family, genus, species)
warranted by each specimen. When diagnostic characteristics were not as variable, such as
presence of a character which had been noted as defining only 65 percent of the time in bison, the
modifier cf. (compares favorably) was used. For example, in the case above, a species
determination would be listed as cf. Bison bison.
Not all of the animal bones were identifiable beyond class. Therefore, size categories were used to
differentiate the various bones. Size categories by class or other taxonomic level are useful for
understanding human subsistence strategies and prey choice preferences (high biomass versus low
biomass) within an environment. Size categories may also give an indication of an environmentâs
overall species richness (Lawton 1990). Size categories for birds include small (e.g., dove,
American golden plover, screech owl), medium (e.g., mallard duck, caracara, red-tailed hawk), and
medium-large (e.g., goose, turkey, great blue heron). Size categories for mammals include very
small mammal (e.g., wood rat, hispid cotton rat, vole), small (e.g., rabbit, prairie dog, squirrel),
small-medium (e.g., opossum, beaver, skunk), medium (e.g., dog, raccoon, bobcat), medium-large
(e.g., deer, pronghorn, pig), and large (e.g., bison, cattle, horse). Identified Artiodactyla bones not
identifiable to species were sub-divided into medium-large artiodactyl (e.g., white-tailed deer, mule
deer, pronghorn), large artiodactyl (e.g., bison, elk), and medium or larger artiodactyl (i.e., any
artiodactyl larger than sheep or goat). Very small Muridae include cotton rats, woodrats, and prairie
voles.
The interpretation of any faunal assemblage is subject to several sources of probable bias. First,
because of preservation factors and excavation techniques, it is impossible to recover every bone
originally deposited in a site. An excavated assemblage, therefore, is by very nature a sample. In
Mercado Site (41TR203)

215

July 2019

addition, it is a sample of a sample because few sites, if any, are excavated in total. Depending on
where excavations occurred within a site, such as in structures, middens, refuse disposal areas, and
activity areas, analysis of the recovered faunal remains can produce varying or conflicting
interpretations. Sample size is another potential source of bias, particularly in small assemblages.
As stated by Grayson (1984a:117), âextremely small samples probably do not provide an adequate
base from which statistical inferences concerning relative abundances within the target population
can be made.â (The target population is the animal set exploited by a group of people [Grayson
1984a:116].) Sample size is also subject to other biases.
Relative taxonomic abundances may be significantly correlated with the size of the samples from
which they have been determined. Consequently, interpretations of relative abundances may prove
to be primarily interpretations of the size of the samples from which the abundances have been
derived (Grayson 1984a:129). One measure of taxonomic abundance is richness. This refers to the
number of taxa (e.g., species) that have contributed to a faunal assemblage (Cruz-Uribe 1988:180;
Grayson 1984a; Leonard 1989:23). Another measure sometimes used to ascertain taxonomic
abundance is general diversity, which takes into account both the number of taxa present (i.e.,
richness) and the relative frequency of each taxon (Cruz-Uribe 1988:179). Some researchers (e.g.,
Grayson 1984a:138â149; Leonard 1989; Leonard and Jones 1989; Meltzer et al. 1992) have shown
strong correlations between richness and sample size as measured by NISP.
In the present analysis, interpretations are based on the NISP, the MNI, and relative percentages.
The MNI is the number of animals of an identified taxon necessary to account for all the recovered
bones of that taxon (Shotwell 1955:330). Although used by American paleontologists as early as
the 1920s (see Grayson 1973:433, 1984a:27â28), the method for determining MNI was introduced
into American archeology by White (1953). Improvements of Whiteâs technique have occurred
over the years (BÃ¶kÃ¶nyi 1970; Chaplin 1971; Grayson 1973, 1979, 1984a). The different methods
utilized for determining MNI, however, can yield varying results for the same assemblage (see
Casteel 1977a, 1977b; Grayson 1973, 1978, 1979, 1984a; Horton 1984; Ringrose 1993:126â128).
As a result, some researchers see little value in the use of MNI (e.g., Casteel 1977b; Turner 1980).
As suggested by Horton (1984:255), âthere is no single âbestâ method, since the one that is chosen
depends upon the result desired, and on the particular features of the site and excavation.â With
these drawbacks in mind, MNI values are presented as a quantitative counterbalance to the NISP
values. It is a means of standardizing the data. In addition, MNI values are used herein because
Mercado Site (41TR203)

216

July 2019

they are relatively unaffected by differential fragmentation among species and samples and are,
therefore, better for assuring comparability among indices computed for different samples (CruzUribe 1988:180; Klein and Cruz-Uribe 1984). In addition, not all levels of aggregation to obtain
MNI values are likely to be sensible according to site contexts and research questions. The problem
of aggregation, therefore, is probably not as great as Grayson (1984b) suggests (Ringrose
1993:128).
After the variables were recorded, the NISP was computed for each taxon and the minimum MNIs
were determined for each identified species or genus (see Table 8.1). The calculation of minimum
MNIs is done in two ways. First, MNIs are calculated based on the site assemblage as a whole and
assume that all specimens of a specific taxon could represent the same individual, regardless of
provenience. Second, the maximum MNIs were calculated based on the total MNIs according to
each of the eight AUs that represent distinctive geomorphic stratigraphic levels that correspond to
three cultural/temporal periods, including Late Archaic, Transitional Late Archaic to Late
Prehistoric, and Late Prehistoric. This type of MNI is based upon provenience or association with
specific features and geomorphic stratigraphic units. The calculation of each type of MNI
considered taxon, element, side, portion, and age, which was based on the degree of bone fusion,
tooth eruption and wear, and porosity (i.e., overall ossification) of bone specimens. The bones of
very young mammals are distinctly spongier (i.e., less ossified) than those of adults. The
calculation of MNI values for higher taxonomic levels and for animal size classes other than
mammals (e.g., small bird, medium bird) was determined by the composition of the assemblage.
For example, if a specimen was identified to a taxonomic level higher than genus (e.g., Rodentia
[order]) and another specimen was recorded at a lower taxonomic level within it (e.g., Neotoma
sp.), the MNI was determined only for the lower taxonomic level.
Not all recovered vertebrate archeofaunal remains from a site are cultural. Although some
researchers base intrusiveness on the presence of partial or nearly complete skeletons of animals,
such as small rodents (Thomas 1971; Ziegler 1973), analysts also must consider the taphonomic
factors affecting the differential preservation of bones (Lyman 1984) as well as recovery
techniques. Szuter (1989:209â219) presents five pieces of evidence for interpreting rodent bones.
Three of these criteria are used in varying degrees in this analysis: (1) ethnographic accounts; (2)
ecological studies; and (3) archeological evidence (including context and condition of the bones).

As indicated by the research questions, elucidation of subsistence patterns is a major focus of this
analysis. Subsistence systems involve at a minimum the interaction of humans, technology, and
floral and faunal resources. The study of these interactions through time and across space provides
a description and an understanding of various lifeways (Lyman 1982:331). A subsistence study,
therefore, requires consideration of more than just the animals. It is intimately involved with the
interaction of humans, including their technology and adaptive exploitative strategies, and animals
with the environment and with each other. Several diverse but related fields of research are used,
including ethnography, environmental science, cultural ecology, and animal ecology.

Natural History and Ethnographic Background

The following are brief descriptions of the natural history of taxa identified to the level of family,
genus, or species (see Table 8.1). Their natural histories provide a database from which to glean
information for reconstruction paleoenvironments and habitats associated with the various
occupations spanning the Late Archaic through the early Late Prehistoric periods at the Mercado
site. When available, ethnographic data are presented for these taxa. These data are derived from a
variety of North American Indian groups, not only those of the Plains and Southwest, and are not
intended to suggest exact usage by the Native American inhabitants of the Project area. Rather,
they are presented as examples of why and how the identified taxa may have been exploited by the
inhabitants of the Mercado site (41TR203).

Class Actinopterygii â Ray-Finned Fishes
Family Ictaluridae (Catfish)

The vertebrate assemblage contains one fish bone, that of a medium-size catfish. Species
associations with general size classifications are not possible for catfish. The bullhead catfish
family is the largest family of freshwater fish endemic to North America north of Mexico, with 40
species found in the U.S. and Canada. Four species of Ictaluridae, including Ictalurus melas (black
bullhead), Ictalurus natalis (yellow bullhead), Ictalurus furcatus (blue catfish), and Ictalurus
punctatus (channel catfish), occur in the West Fork of the Trinity River in the vicinity of the
Mercado site (41TR203). A single non-diagnostic cranial specimen was recovered from AU 8;
thus, it could represent one of the following four species that occur in the region.

Mercado Site (41TR203)

218

July 2019

The black bullhead, Ictalurus melas, prefers slow-moving or still water over mud or other soft
bottoms in lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams. It avoids upland streams. It can attain a length of 15 to
30 cm. Spawning occurs in May or June with the spawning season varying widely according to
locality, and it may extend into August. Although the black bullhead, a bottom feeder, is
omnivorous, it browses along the bottom in search of anything edible (Page and Burr 1991:194;
Thompson 1985:106â107).
The yellow bullhead, Ictalurus natalis, prefers slow-moving or still water over mud or other soft
bottoms in lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams. It can attain a length of 15 to 30 cm. Spawning occurs
in May or June with the spawning season varying widely according to locality, and it may extend
into August. Although the yellow bullhead, a bottom feeder, is primarily carnivorous and will eat
almost any animal matter, the bulk of its diet consists of aquatic insects, but it also consumes
clams, snails, leeches, worms, and small fish (Page and Burr 1991:194; Thompson 1985:108).
The blue catfish, Ictalurus furcatus, occurs in rivers with a swift current where it can attain a large
size. A length of 1.2 m and weight of more than 68 kilograms (kg) is possible. However, a size of 9
to 18 kg is more common. Spawning occurs in late spring and early summer in pools and
backwaters. Although the blue catfish, a bottom feeder, is primarily carnivorous, its principal diet
consists of other fish, and it is also a scavenger that feeds mainly at night (Brown 1970:6; Cross
1967:210â212; Kemp 1971:35; Parmalee et al. 1972:Table 11; Sublette et al. 1990:237â239).
The channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, prefers slow-moving or still water over deep pools with
mud or other soft bottoms in lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams but avoids upland streams. It can
attain a length of 1.27 m. Spawning occurs in May or June. Although the channel catfish, a bottom
feeder, is omnivorous, it also browses along the bottom in search of anything edible (Page and Burr
1991:191â192).

Class Amphibia â Amphibians
Family Bufonidae (True Toads)

Bufo sp. (n = 1)
Only one amphibian bone was recovered from the site. Species present included toads the size of a
large woodhouse toad. There was also one bone classified as herpetile that was indeterminate

219

between reptile and amphibian. Five species of toads, including Bufo debilis (eastern green toad),
Bufo punctatus (red-spotted road), Bufo Speciosus (Texas toad), Bufo valliceps (Gulf Coast toad),
and Bufo woodhouseii (Woodhouseâs toad), occur in the vicinity of the Mercado site (41TR203). A
single femur shaft was recovered from AU 8; thus, it may represent any of the following five
species.
Bufo debilis (eastern green toad) matures to be 1.5â2 inches long. It thrives in unusually dry
habitats in open, grassy plains near pools where breeding takes place. It is primarily nocturnal, and
breeding occurs from March to September when rain sufficiently fills pools, ditches, or streambeds.
If conditions are not favorable, it will not breed. It feeds on a variety of insects (Garrett and
Barker 1987:6).
Bufo punctatus (red-spotted toad) matures to be 1.5 to 3 inches long. It thrives in unusually dry
habitats in open grassland, but requires a constant source of moisture such as springs, seepages,
pools along streams, and cattle tanks. It is primarily nocturnal and most active at twilight. It feeds
on a variety of insects. Breeding occurs from April to September when rain sufficiently fills pools,
ditches, or streambeds (Garrett and Barker 1987:10).
Bufo speciosus (Texas toad) matures to be 2 to 3 5/8 inches long. It is adapted to dry environments,
prefers sandy soils, and can be found in a variety of habitats ranging from prairies to open
woodlands to cultivated areas. Its sources of moisture in dry locales are cattle tanks, irrigation
ditches, and temporary rain pools. It feeds on a variety of insects. Breeding occurs from April to
September after rains sufficiently fills pools, ditches, or streambeds (Garrett and Barker 1987:11).
Bufo valliceps (Gulf Coast toad) matures to be 2 to 4 inches long. It occurs in a variety of moist
habitats that include ditches, gardens, dump sites, and storm sewers. It is primarily nocturnal and is
most active during twilight. It feeds on a variety of insects. Breeding occurs from March to
September when rain sufficiently fills pools, ditches, or streambeds (Garrett and Barker 1987:12).
Bufo woodhouseii (Woodhouseâs toad) occurs where suitable soils and moister conditions exist,
such as in river valleys. It is usually confined to the vicinity of streams and river valleys, and to
agricultural areas and river floodplains in more mesic habitats with permanent water. This toad is
an excellent burrower that prefers loose soil. As with most toad species, Woodhouseâs Toad is
nocturnal, emerging from its burrow to feed at dusk and after dark. It breeds from March to
Mercado Site (41TR203)

220

September in permanent water or in temporary pools after heavy summer rains (Degenhardt et al.
1996:61â63; Garrett and Barker 1987:15; Johnson 1977:76â78; Stebbins 1985:72, Map 33;
Wheeler and Wheeler 1966:4, 44; Williamson et al. 1994:161â162).
Because toads are fossorial and/or seek shelter in burrows, their presence within the site is
considered intrusive. In addition, it is doubtful that true toads (i.e., Bufo spp.) were eaten because
they produce a toxic skin secretion that is irritating to the eyes and to mucous membranes and can
cause skin inflammations (Brown 1985:560; Conant 1975:305; Johnson 1977:70; Stebbins
1985:68-69; Williamson et al. 1994:153, 159, 161).
8.3.3
8.3.3.1

Class Reptilia â Reptiles
Family Emydidae (Box and Water Turtles)

Terrapene sp. (Box Turtle) (n = 2)
There were a total of 52 reptile bones recovered from site 41TR203. Medium-sized reptiles,
specifically turtles but some snakes as well, dominated the reptile assemblage. There were no large
reptiles (e.g., alligators) recovered from the site. Some researchers may assume that only
medium-sized reptiles were consumed, but there is coprolitic evidence from southwest Texas and
elsewhere (Bryant 1974; Reinhard and Bryant 1992) that Native Americans consumed small
lizards. Given other evidence for cultural modification of the bone (e.g., cuts and thermal
alteration), the reptile specimens are considered having a cultural association.
Terrapene sp. (box turtle) can attain a length of 10 to 15 cm. It is a terrestrial species that can
enclose itself in its shell. It prefers dry open grasslands, seldom entering wooded areas. Although it
is very dependent upon water, the box turtle may enter shallow pools during hot weather. Box
turtles hibernate in the ground during the winter, and burrows can reach depths of 61 cm in open
grasslands but are shallower in woodlands. These turtles can have a population density of more
than one individual per acre. The box turtle is omnivorous, with a diet consisting of insects,
vegetation, and carrion (Collins 1974:95â98; Degenhardt and Christiansen 1974:30â33; Ernst and
Barbour 1972:96â102; Williamson et al. 1994:134). Although the box turtle is sometimes eaten, it
is believed to be a source of illness (Ernst and Barbour 1972:95).

Trachemys scripta (Red-eared Slider) (n = 41)
Trachemys/Pseudemys sp. (Slider/Cooter Turtle) (n = 2)
The slider (Trachemys scripta), which attains a length of 9 to 36 cm, is an aquatic species that
seldom ventures far on land. It prefers quiet water, soft bottoms, and abundant aquatic vegetation.
The slider basks on logs or floats at the surface. Hibernation occurs in underwater burrows and in
hollow stumps. Nesting usually takes place in damp, friable soil near water. Several clutches of
eggs are laid from late April to July, with births occurring from early July to late September. Its
diet consists of aquatic plants, crayfish, snails, tadpoles, fish, and insects (Degenhardt and
Christinsen 1974:37â40; Ernst and Barbour 1972:147â154; Stebbins 1985:100â101).
Turtles were consumed as secondary food resources by the prehistoric inhabitants of Texas.
Although box turtles may have been easy to obtain by simply picking them up when observed,
special techniques were probably necessary to obtain aquatic and semi-aquatic species. Some,
however, may have been caught when they ventured onto land to nest. After killing the turtles with
a stone, the Miwok roasted the turtles in ashes until they split open. Then, the intestines were
removed (Barrett and Gifford 1933:139). Among the Pawnee, turtles were used to make soup
(Weltfish 1977:231). After first killing the turtles by putting their heads in a fire, the Cheyenne
eviscerated them while they were still in their shells. âThen a large fire was built, and the turtles
were placed about it, standing up on the edges of their shells and thus roasted. Some people boiled
the turtles in their shellsâ (Grinnell 1923[I]:308). The Florida Seminole usually did not kill the
turtles prior to preparing them for consumption, rather ââ¦they merely cut off the plastron and
butcher the animal alive and kicking, when it is set up before the fire and roasted in its own ovenâ
(Skinner 1913:76â77). The Southeastern groups ate turtle eggs (Swanton 1946:298).
Besides functioning as a food resource, turtles have also been used as a source of raw material for
utilitarian objects and ornaments, such as carapace bowls and rattles, by a variety of peoples, such
as the Southeastern groups (Swanton 1946:252, 627). The Hopi, one of many groups that used
turtle shells as dance rattles, killed the turtles to be used as rattles:
by cutting the skin away from the shell and drawing the body out of the shell by the
neck. The body was thrown back into the water in the belief that it would grow a
new shell and so be caught again on another occasion. The shells were brought

back to the village and hung up to dry in the sun, being tested at intervals by flicking
with the forefinger to determine the amount of drying advisable to produce the
maximum sound. Sheepâs hooves were tied to the shells to produce the completed
rattle (Beaglehole 1936:23).
Formerly, the Navajo used a turtle carapace as a medicine cup in chants (Kluckhohn and
Wyman 1940:45). The Menomini often tipped arrows, for use in battle, with turtle claws
(Skinner 1921:322).

Lacertilia â Lizards
Several species of lizards, including Ophisaurus attenuates attenuates (western slender glass
lizard), Hemidactylus turcicus (Mediterranean gecko), Anolis carolinensis (green anole),
Cophosaurus texanus taxanus (Texas earless lizard), Crotaphytus collaris collaris (eastern collared
lizard), Holbrookia maculate perspicua (eastern earless lizard), Phrynosoma cornutum (Texas
horned lizard), Sceloporus olivaceus (Texas spiny lizard), Scelporus undulates consobrinus
(southern prairie lizard), Sceloporus undulates hyacinthinus (northern fence lizard), Eumeces
faciatus (five-line skink), Eumeces obsoletus (plains skink), Aumeces septentrionalis obtusirostris
(southern prairie skink), Scincella lateralis (ground skink), Cnemidophorus gularis gularis (Texas
spotted whiptail), and Cnemidophours sexlineatus viridis (prairie-lined racerunner) (Garrett and
Barker 1987:130â191), are indigenous to the Mercado site area along the West Fork of the Trinity
River. A few lizard specimens (n = 2) are not identifiable to a lower taxonomic level.
Lizards were consumed by many peoples, such as the Hualapai and Yavapai (Gifford 1936:268;
Spier 1928:117, 123), some Florida groups (Swanton 1946:252, 281, 298), and Texas coastal
groups (Krieger 1956:50, 53â54). Larger lizards (e.g., chuckwalla) that were worth catching and
preparing due to their size, were eaten by some Basin-Plateau groups (Steward 1938:40), Death
Valley groups (Wallace 1978), and the Yavapai (Gifford 1936:268). The Hualapai used a hooked
or barbed stick to pull chuckwallas from rock crevices (McGuire 1983:32). Similar techniques were
employed by the Yavapai (Gifford 1936:268) and Death Valley groups (Wallace 1978). A probable
lizard-extracting hook recovered from a rock shelter in Death Valley consists of a hardwood handle

with an attached sharply pointed bone barb (Wallace 1978:110â112). After capturing a chuckwalla,
the Yavapai killed it by seizing it by the tail and striking it against a rock. Then, either gutted or
ungutted, it was cooked in hot ashes (Gifford 1936:268). The Miwok roasted lizards in hot ashes
after gutting them (Barrett and Gifford 1933:137, 139). Lizards caught by the Tarahumara were
skinned and roasted on a spit. The Tarahumara also used some lizard species for medicinal
purposes such as remedies for toothaches, headaches, and sterility in women. The open bodies of
lizards were used as a poultice for fractured bones (Bennett and Zingg 1935:127; Pennington
1963:134â135). The Yavapai occasionally fed lizards to captive eagles and hawks (Gifford
1932:240).
The paucity (n = 2), small size, and unburned condition of the recovered lizard remains from the
Mercado site suggest that their presence is not the result of cultural factors. In addition, lizards seek
refuge and/or hibernate in burrows. Therefore, the lizard is considered intrusive (i.e., natural).
Although it is possible that lizards may have been occasionally consumed by the occupants of the
Mercado site during times of extreme food stress, the quantity and type of recovered faunal remains
indicate that this generally was not the case.

Family Colubridae (Non-poisonous Snakes)

Lampropeltis sp. (Kingsnake) (n = 2)
Three species of kingsnakes, including Lampropeltis calligaster calligaster (prairie kingsnake),
Lam- propeltis getulus holbrooki (speckled kingsnake), and Lampropeltis getulus splendida (desert
kingsnake), occur in the vicinity of the Mercado site. Snake specimens consist of vertebrae that
could be associated with any of these three species. However, of the three species, the site area is
within the primary environs of the prairie kingsnake.
Lampropeltis calligaster calligaster (prairie kingsnake) attains a length of 2 to 3 ft and prefers open
grassland, rocky hillside pasture, and riparian woodland habitats. Its diet includes mice, rats,
gophers, moles, birds, frogs, toads, lizards, and other snakes. It is egg-bearing, laying clutches in
earthen cavities several inches below the ground surface during June and July (Tennant 1985:151).
Lampropeltis getulus holbrooki (speckled kingsnake) is found primarily in the easternmost part of
Texas, east of the West Fork of the Trinity River. It usually attains a length of 18 to 36 in, although
the record length is 6 ft. It prefers damp grassy pastures and shelter beneath piles of driftwood and

logs in forested bottomland. It is a powerful constrictor and is generally carnivorous, with a diet
consisting of smaller vertebrates, foraging mostly at night. It is egg-bearing in early summer and
hatches in late summer (Tennant 1985:168).
Lampropeltis getulus splendida (desert kingsnake) is found primarily in the western half of Texas,
west of the West Fork of the Trinity River. It attains a length of 22 to 38 in with a record of 60 in. It
prefers subterranean environs for protection from predators. Its diet includes other snakes, lizards,
and small mammals. It is egg-bearing, laying clutches in late June or July and as deep as 12 in
below the ground surface (Tennant 1985:169).
8.3.3.4

Family Viperidae (Poisonous Snakes)

Eight species of poisonous snakes, including Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma (western
cottonmouth), Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix (southern copperhead), Agkistrodon contortrix
laticinctus (broad-banded copperhead), Crotalus atrox (western diamondback rattlesnake),
Crotalus horridus (timber or canebrake rattlesnake), Sistrurus milirius streckeri (western pygmy
rattlesnake), Sistrurus catenatus tergeminus (western massasauga), and Micrurus fulvius tenere
(Texas coral snake), occur in the vicinity of the Mercado site. Snake specimens consist of a
vertebra that could be associated with any of these eight species.
Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma (western cottonmouth) is found primarily in the eastern half of
Texas that includes the West Fork of the Trinity River. It generally attains a length of 20 to 30 in,
with a record of 60 in. It prefers woodland or grassland, most often within a quarter-mile of
permanent water. It favors semiaquatic environments but can survive in entirely dry environments.
Its diet is primarily frogs, but also includes fish, mammals as large as muskrats and young
cottontails, water birds, and water snakes. It is a live-bearing snake with young born during August,
September, and October (Tennant 1985:226; Werler 1978:21â22).
Agkistrodon contortrix laticinctus (broad-banded copperhead) is found primarily in the central part
of Texas, with its eastern boundary near the West Fork of the Trinity River. It attains a length of
18 to 38 in. It prefers tree-shaded areas where leaves, logs, and branches offer terrestrial shelter. Its
diet includes a variety of prey with deer and harvest mice being most common. It is live-bearing,
laying clutches in July through September (Tennant 1985:230; Werler 1978:14â15).

Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix (southern copperhead) is found primarily in the eastern third of
Texas, with its western boundary near the West Fork of the Trinity River. It attains a length of 18
to 30 in, with a record of approximately 38 in. It prefers tree-shaded areas where leaves, logs, and
branches offer terrestrial shelter. Its diet includes a variety of prey, with white-footed and harvest
mice being most common. It is live-bearing, laying clutches in July through September (Tennant
1985:228; Werler 1978:12â13).
Crotalus atrox (western diamondback rattlesnake) is found throughout Texas, with the exception of
the easternmost part of the state. It is the largest, most widespread and most dangerous serpent in
the state. It attains a length of 3 to 4 ft. It is a resident of nearly every terrestrial habitat within its
range. Its diet includes mostly mammals such as mice, cottontails, jackrabbits, and ground-living
birds. It is live-bearing with birthing usually in September (Tennant 1985:233â234; Werler
1978:30â31).
Crotalus horridus (timber or canebrake rattlesnake) is found in the eastern third of Texas, with the
Trinity River near its western boundary. It attains a length of 30 to 60 in, with a record of just over
74 in. It prefers dense, extensive thickets and also occurs in deciduous woods and second-growth
pastures of unused farmland. Its diet includes mostly mammals, such as mice, cottontails, rats, and
squirrels. It is live-bearing with birthing usually in late summer (Tennant 1985:238; Werler
1978:34â35).
Sistrurus catenatus tergeminus (western massasauga) is found in central Texas within the Trinity
River drainage. It generally attains a length of 24 in, with a record of nearly 35 in. It prefers
grasslands and is primarily nocturnal, hiding below ground or in dense clumps of prickly pear
cactus or bunchgrass during the daylight. Its diet includes mostly small mammals including mice,
lizards, snakes, and frogs. It is live-bearing with birthing usually in July and August (Tennant
1985:246; Werler 1978:24â25).
Sistrurus milirius streckeri (western pygmy rattlesnake) is found in the eastern third of Texas, with
its western boundary within the vicinity of the West Fork of the Trinity River. It generally attains a
length of 18 to 24 in. It prefers dry habitats and is primarily nocturnal. Its diet includes mostly
small mammals as well as mice, lizards, snakes, and frogs. It is live-bearing with birthing during
the summer and late summer (Werler 1978:28â29).

Micrurus fulvius tenere (Texas coral snake) is found in the southeastern half of Texas with its
northwestern boundary near the vicinity of the West Fork of the Trinity River. It generally attains a
length of 30 in. It prefers dry habitats that include coastal plains, pine woods, hardwood forests,
rocky canyons, and sandy wooded areas. It is an efficient burrower, coming to the surface after
warm rains to feed upon small lizards and snakes. It is Texasâs only poisonous snake that is eggbearing (Werler 1978:45â46).
Several historic groups, such as the Miwok (Barrett and Gifford 1933:137), Shoshonean groups
(Steward 1938:40), and Texas coastal peoples (Krieger 1956:50, 53â54) ate snakes. Rattlesnake
meat was considered a delicacy by the Tonkawa (Sjoberg 1953:286). Most people did not consider
snakes as food items, although some groups, such as the Choctaw (Campbell 1959:13), did
consume them as famine foods. The Navajo had a taboo against the killing of snakes. To do so was
believed to cause aches and pains in the spine (Hill 1938:176). The Western Apache generally did
not molest snakes. âWhen snakes were killed, accidentally or otherwise, they were buried to
prevent contact with snake blood or a dead snake, for if such occurred it was believed that the
unfortunate person would become crippledâ (Buskirk 1986:142). The Sanpoil and Nespelem
believed that eating snake flesh would result in âgradual withering and deathâ (Ray 1932:90).
Snakes were more likely to be used for non-subsistence purposes. The Gros Ventre sometimes
decorated the backs of bows with snakeskins (Kroeber 1908:151). The Wishram dipped their arrow
points in rattlesnake venom (Spier and Sapir 1930:199, 231). Some Southeastern groups used the
teeth of venomous snakes as arrow points. In addition, some Southeastern medicine men used
snake teeth for scarification and wore snakeskins, or even live snakes, on their heads (Swanton
1946:252). Among the Omaha, if someone disregarded the authority of the chiefs or disturbed the
social order, official punishment (i.e., death) was administered with the poisoned end of an
ironwood staff that was also tipped with rattlesnake fangs (Fletcher and La Flesche 1911:213). The
Southern Miwock used rattlesnake meat as medicine (Barrett and Gifford 1933:137). Both nonpoisonous and poisonous snakes have a prominent and significant role in the Snake Ceremony of
the Hopi. The ceremony, which has been described as an elaborate prayer for rain (Hough
1903:51), is announced 16 days before its celebration commences. It consists of 9 days of
ceremonies. The ceremonies of the first 7 days are held in secret. The final two days are public
dances performed in the plaza. The dance on the first public day is the Antelope Dance, and the
dance on the second public day is the Snake Dance proper (Fewkes 1897:277).

The Pomo performed a ceremony which required the use of a rattlesnake. A single rattlesnake was
caught with a forked stick. After its mouth was sewn up, the snake was taken to the village where a
man held it between his teeth as he danced around a pole. Following the dance, the snake was
placed in a hole and given an offering of feathers and beads. Then the stitches were removed from
its mouth, and it was returned to the spot where it was captured. This Rattlesnake Ceremony was an
integral part of the Pole Ceremony which was performed to ensure good crops and bountiful
harvests (Barrett 1952:57).
Most, if not all, of these types of non-subsistence functions, unfortunately, have a low probability
for preservation in the archeological record. Therefore, in some situations it is not possible to
determine whether the presence of snake remains is due to cultural factors. The paucity of snake
remains within the vertebrate assemblage, however, suggests their presence is intrusive, not
cultural.

Class Aves â Birds
Family Anatidae (Web-footed Waterfowl)

Tribe Anserini â Geese
Branta canadensis (Canada Goose) (n = 1)
There were a total of 16 avian bones recovered from site 41TR203, of which only 5 were
identifiable beyond class, belonging to the order Anseriformes (water fowl) including a Canada
goose (Branta canadensis), small to medium duck and medium duck or goose (Anatidae), and
unassignable waterfowl (Anseriformes). Overall, medium aves (e.g., duck, goose, etc.) dominate
the avian assemblage.
The Canada goose (Branta canadensis) is a year-round resident in the Dallas area. Its habitat
consists of marshes and stream channels. Breeding begins in early March. Nesting sites include
marshes, the tops of muskrat houses, islands, and cliffs. Nests are lined with down. Most clutches
contain 4 to 7 eggs. Molting occurs about a month after the young hatch. The Canada goose is
attracted to cultivated fields where it feeds on grains such as maize. In addition, grasses and marsh
plants are also consumed (Bellrose 1976:141â164; Peterson 1990:40, Map 35; Rue 1973:7â17).

Geese were important secondary food items for many peoples. Although not hunted extensively by
the Gros Ventre, goose eggs were a favorite food (Kroeber 1908:149). The Miwok employed fire at
night to attract geese. As the birds approached, they were killed with clubs (Barrett and Gifford
1933:187). Whenever available, geese were eaten by the Pomo, who usually hunted them with
bows and wood-pointed arrows, and slings. The Wintun and some Pomo groups even hunted geese
with a type of bola. After the birds were plucked, they were broiled (Barrett 1952:100, 140, 148).
Geese also had non-subsistence-related functions. Goose feathers are used ceremonially by various
Puebloan groups (Beidleman 1956:18). The Zuni use the feathers of this bird on prayer sticks. In
addition, ceremonial dance masks and ritual objects are decorated with goose feathers (Ladd
1963:81). The Pomo used goose feathers in making some clothes. In addition, down was used for a
head-net. Whistles and ear ornaments were manufactured from the wing bones (Barrett 1952:100).
Although the Canada goose is presently considered a choice game bird (Martin et al. 1951:51), the
paucity of goose remains (n = 1) recovered from the Mercado site suggests geese were not
generally the focus of subsistence strategies. They were probably obtained opportunistically,
possibly attracted to cultivated fields.
8.3.5

Class Mammalia â Mammals

There are 7,174 mammal bones recovered from site 41TR203, of which 2,018 (28.1 percent) are
unassignable to a size designation due to the fragmented condition of the bone. A total of 5,155 are
assignable to a size category. Overall, large mammals (bison-size) account for 1,449 specimens or
28.1 percent of the mammal assemblage. Medium-large mammals (deer/pronghorn-size) account
for 868 specimens, or 16.8 percent of the mammal assemblage. Medium-size mammals
(dog/coyote- and beaver-size) account for 34 specimens or 0.7 percent of the mammal assemblage.
A general grouping of medium or large mammals accounts for 2,567 specimens or 49.8 percent of
mammal assemblage. Higher body mass mammals, such as bison-size and deer/antelope-size,
dominate the assemblage. Small-medium (e.g., fox and raccoon-size) and small mammals (e.g.,
lagomorph- and squirrel-size) account for 18 specimens, or 0.3 percent, and 179 specimens, or 3.5
percent, account for the mammal assemblage, respectively. Very small mammals and microtines,
such as cotton rats, pocket gophers, harvest mouse, and ground squirrel, comprise 0.8 percent (n =
41) of the mammalian assemblage (see Table 8.1).

Family Leporidae (Rabbits, Hares)

Sylvilagus sp. (Cottontail) (n = 34)
Although the cottontail (Sylvilagus sp.) specimens were not identified to the species level, two
species, including the swamp rabbit (S. aquaticus) and eastern cottontail (S. floridanus), of this
small game mammal may be represented within the faunal assemblage.
The eastern cottontail is the most widespread, occurring throughout the state (Bailey 1931:54;
Davis and Schmidly 1994:86â92; Findley et al. 1975:89). The majority, if not all, of the cottontail
remains are probably of this species (Bailey 1913:18, 33, 1931:54; Davis and Schmidly 1994:86â
92). It inhabits brushland and marginal areas and seldom ventures far from brush cover.
Brush or shrubs are necessary for resting and hiding (Bailey 1931:54â60; Chapman and Willner
1978:2â3; Clark and Stromberg 1987:80; Findley 1987:57; Zeveloff 1988:92). This cottontail
subsists mainly on grasses, forbs, and shrubs (Bailey 1931:55â56; Chapman et al. 1982:102;
Chapman and Willner 1978:3). Cultivated plants, including maize, are also eaten (Bailey 1931:55â
56; Chapman et al. 1982:101). Much of the cottontailâs water requirements are provided by its food
(Bailey 1923:71â72; Chapman et al. 1982:102; Findley 1987:57; Zeveloff 1988:92).
The archaeofaunal assemblage may contain remains of the swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus),
but it is not very likely. The Mercado site is at the western boundary of the swamp rabbit (Bailey
1913:43, 1931:63), which prefers poorly drained river bottoms and coastal marshes. It is adapted to
a semi-aquatic habitat and is at home in the water (Davis and Schmidly 1994:87).
The cottontail has a restricted home range of usually 1 to 5 acres and is normally active early in the
morning and at night. Predation by a variety of animals, including bobcats, coyotes, foxes,
raccoons, skunks, raptors, snakes, is the major cause of cottontail deaths, and it is the primary
regulator of cottontail abundance (Chapman et al. 1982:106â107; Clark and Stromberg 1987:78â
79; Ingles 1941:236; Zeveloff 1988:88, 92). The cottontail, however, is an r-selected mammal. Its
high mortality rate is offset by a high reproductive rate. Breeding generally occurs from mid or late
winter through late summer. A single female may have as many as 6 litters, usually of 4 to 7
individuals, per year. The first and last litters of the year tend to be smaller. Female desert
cottontail born in the spring are capable of breeding during their first summer, offsetting their low
litter sizes. The young are born hairless and blind in a pear-shaped, fur-lined nest dug 6 to 10

inches into the ground (Chapman et al. 1982:94; Clark and Stromberg 1987:78, 81; Findley
1987:57â58; Hoffmeister 1986:131, 137; Martin et al. 1951:241â242; Zeveloff 1988:93).
Cottontails were hunted for food and other uses by many historic peoples, such as the Navajo (Hill
1938:171), Hopi (Beaglehole 1936:11â15), Omaha (Fletcher and La Flesche (1911:104, 376, 451),
and Chippewa (Densmore 1929:44). Although cottontails were occasionally killed during
communal hunts or drives for jackrabbits, different hunting strategies were utilized to procure
cottontails due to their behavior. They do not usually venture far from cover and when alarmed,
they seek shelter in burrows. In addition, âcottontails often move along regular paths, wearing trails
or runways in the vegetation, snow, or underbrush pilesâ (Schwartz and Schwartz 1981:104). Thus,
they are easy to find. Finally, cottontails do not run as fast as, nor do they run as far as, jackrabbits.
All these factors make it easier for cottontails to be procured by individual hunters using simple
techniques such as snares and traps.
Basin-Plateau groups hunted cottontails with snares and with bows and arrows (Steward 1938:39).
The Omaha used headless arrows with sharpened shafts for hunting rabbits (Fletcher and La
Flesche 1911:451). The Sanpoil also killed rabbits with bows and arrows (Ray 1932:87). The Hopi
used deadfalls and snares to catch rabbits (Beaglehole 1936:17). Among the Northern Shoshone,
cottontails were hunted by boys with the aid of dogs (Lowie 1909:185). Some groups such as the
Chiricahua Apache employed long sticks to dislodge rabbits from burrows. An end was twisted
into the fur and then the animal was pulled out (Opler 1941:326). Before thrusting the stick into the
hole, the Navajo worked one end down to a point and abraded it so that it would catch in the fur
easier. If the burrow had two openings, however, the Navajo built a fire in one and smoked the
animal out. Cottontails caught in the jackrabbit drives were clubbed (Hill 1938:171).
After skinning rabbits and removing the internal organs, the Pomo pounded the carcasses to a pulp.
This reduced the bones to small fragments that could be easily consumed with the meat which was
broiled (Barrett 1952:63). After the cottontails were skinned and cleaned, the Shoshone cooked
them in the hot ashes (Lowie 1924:197). Although the Havasupai usually roasted rabbits in ashes,
roasting pits may also have been used (Spier 1928:117). The Chippewa prepared the carcasses two
ways:

Mercado Site (41TR203)

a.

The meat was removed from the bones, roasted, and pounded. The bones were then
pounded with what meat remained on them. The pounded bones were boiled in a small
kettle and the grease skimmed off and eaten with the pounded meat.

b.

The meat was cut in pieces and dried, along with the bones. The bones were pounded into a
powder and mixed with the dry meat and any available grease. This was eaten dry, and not
boiled at the time of using (Densmore 1929:44).

As stated earlier, cottontails also had non-subsistence functions. Caddo women used rabbit skins
dyed red for tying their hair behind their heads (Espinosa 1927:177). The Sanpoil used rabbit fur
for caps, mittens, and blankets (Ray 1932:87). The Ute (Lowie 1924:216) and Plains Cree
(Mandelbaum 1940:214) also had rabbit skin blankets. These were worn as robes and/or functioned
as bedding. Although rabbit skin robes were commonly made with only jackrabbit skins by many
peoples, some groups, such as the Havasupai (Spier 1928:188, 190) and Shoshone (Lowie
1924:216), also used cottontail skins. The cup-and-pin game was played with either a cottontail or
jackrabbit skull by the Havasupai (Spier 1928:340).
Lepus californicus (Black-tailed Jackrabbit) (n = 8)
The black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) occurs throughout the entire state and inhabits
deserts and open short-grass prairies with scattered shrubs. In addition, this jackrabbit is very
adaptable to agricultural conditions (Davis and Schmidly 1994:92â94). Areas of heavy brush or
woods are avoided (Cockrum 1982:134â135; Dunn et al. 1982:133; Findley 1987:54â55; Findley
et al. 1975:93â94; Hoffmeister 1986:140â141; Zeveloff 1988:98). âThey are found in mesquite,
sagebrush, desertscrub, into open piÃ±on-juniperâ (Hoffmeister 1986:141). The black-tailed
jackrabbit is most common, however, in open, treeless habitats (Findley 1987:55).
The jackrabbit usually feeds at night on grasses, mesquite, and herbs. Cultivated crops are also
consumed. As with the cottontail, the jackrabbit obtains protein and certain B vitamins by
consuming its soft droppings. This leporid, like the cottontail, depends on succulent or green
vegetation for water. Surface water, however, is drunk when available. The size of the jackrabbit
home range is dependent upon the availability of food, cover, and water. The black-tailed
jackrabbit has a home range that varies from 4 to 75 ha. Daylight hours are usually spent in its
form, an unlined hollow scratched into the ground. Forms are found both in the open and in dense
vegetation. The breeding season extends from mid or late winter to late summer. As a result, a

single female may have as many as 7 litters, usually of 2 to 4 individuals, per year. The young are
born in shallow depressions or excavations that are sometimes fur-lined. Unlike cottontails, the
newborns are precocial (more independent). They are fully furred, can see, and are able to move
about. Because the black-tailed jackrabbit is an r-selected species, the yearly number and size of
litters per breeding female help to offset the high mortality rates. The jackrabbit is subject to
predation by a wide variety of predators, such as snakes, eagles, hawks, owls, coyotes, foxes,
bobcats, skunks, and humans (Clark and Stromberg 1987:84â87; Cockrum 1982:134; Dunn et al.
1982; Findley 1987:56; Hoffmeister 1986:141â142; Schwartz and Schwartz 1981:114â121;
Zeveloff 1988:84, 98â100).
Although some people consider jackrabbit flesh unpalatable or inferior to that of the cottontail
(e.g., Buskirk 1986:134; Castetter and Opler 1936:25; Dunn et al. 1982:137; Opler 1941:325â326;
TGFOC 1945:133â134), ethnographic data indicate jackrabbits were exploited as food resources
and as raw material sources by many peoples, such as the Navajo (Hill 1938:170â171), Havasupai
(Spier 1928:108), Omaha (Fletcher and La Flesche 1911:104), Cheyenne (Grinnell 1923:I:247,
II:218, 269), Coahuiltecans (Ruecking 1953:481), and Basin-Plateau groups (Steward 1938:38â39).
Jackrabbit behavior is ideal for communal hunts and drives. When alarmed, the jackrabbit may
remain motionless or run away slowly or very rapidly. It can attain speeds of 30 to 35 mi (56 km)
per hour over short distances. Normally, a jump covers 5 to 10 ft (1.5 to 3 m), but the distance
increases to 15 to 20 ft (4.6 to 6 m) when the animal is speeding. It can also jump as high as 5.5 ft
(1.7 m) (Dunn et al. 1982:134; Findley 1987:56; Schwartz and Schwartz 1981:119). Therefore,
hunting the jackrabbit with a bow and arrow is difficult. Communal efforts are more efficient.
Although the Hopi held communal rabbit hunts at irregular intervals through the year, such hunts
usually occurred in early summer and fall when the crops had to be protected from the rabbits or
when rabbits were needed daily to feed captive eagles. The hunters formed a two-winged circle
and, as they walked toward the center of it, they flushed the rabbits from the bushes and killed them
with curved or straight pointed throwing sticks (Beaglehole 1936:11â17). The Navajo clubbed the
jackrabbits as they tried to escape an encircled area. Although nets and corrals were not used by the
Navajo when hunting rabbits, fire was occasionally employed. After the animals were encircled
with fire, they were clubbed to death as the fire closed in on them (Hill 1938:170â171). BasinPlateau groups also used fire surrounds but not very often âbecause desert shrubs are usually too
widely spaced for a fire to spreadâ (Steward 1938:39). Instead, the jackrabbits were driven into a
Mercado Site (41TR203)

233

large semicircular arrangement of long, low nets where the animals were killed with sticks or bows
and arrows (Steward 1938:38â39). After driving them into huge nets, as much as 100 yards long,
the Paiutes shot the rabbits with arrows (Lowie 1924:196â197). The Havasupai did not encircle the
rabbits. Instead, they employed a straight formation to drive the animals which were then shot,
never clubbed (Spier 1928:112). Communal hunts could last for several days or as much as a
month (e.g., see Lowie 1924:196â198; Steward 1938:97). Western farmers used large rabbit drives
in the late 1800s to control jackrabbit populations (Dunn et al. 1982:138). Jackrabbits âtend to
graze forage more severely than cattleâ (Findley 1987:56).
After the rabbits were skinned and dressed, the Hopi cooked the meat in a pot with maize and
squash (Beaglehole 1936:14). The Havasupai roasted rabbits in ashes and possibly in roasting pits
(Spier 1928:117). Shoshonean groups employed several methods to cook rabbits, including hot
ashes and watertight baskets in which hot stones were placed for heating the contents. In addition,
some of the Shoshonean groups pounded the bones very fine and consumed them with the meat
(Lowie 1924:196â197, 233).
Most of the aforementioned groups made jackrabbit skin robes and/or blankets. The construction
techniques were basically similar. Therefore, only one, that of the Plains Cree, is presented:
A rabbit was flayed by breaking through the skin at the tendons of the hind legs and
the whole hide peeled back over the head. The hide was then cut in one continuous
strip, 3 to 4 inches wide, and hung to dry for 2 days. It soon curled so that the fur
was outermost on all sides. Four poles were lashed together to make a rectangular
frame. A strip of hide was laced to the top of the frame and a line of perforations
punched along its length. Similar strips were attached to the two vertical sides of the
frame. The initial strand of fur was passed in and out of the top holes and then
through one hole on the side strip where it was looped back on itself. The âsimple
loopâ netting technique was used. When one strand ran out, another was knotted to
it (Mandelbaum 1940:214).
Jackrabbits also had other non-subsistence uses. Some Northern Shoshone men wore rabbit skin
caps with several rabbit tails attached (Lowie 1909:181). Sometimes, Havasupai women used tubes
made from jackrabbit leg bones as rattles on their belts (Spier 1928:188). The cup-and-pin game of
the Havasupai utilizes the jackrabbit.
Mercado Site (41TR203)

The cup and pin game consists of a cotton-tail or jackrabbit skull fastened to a
sharply pointed twig, about 8 cm. long, by a slightly longer cord. The base of the
skull is cut away, the teeth drawn, and it is boiled free of meat. The cord is tied
behind the incisors. Holding the stick, the skull is swung toward the body and
caught on the point. Catching by any hole scores 1; any tooth hole, 6; ear hole, 10;
incisor hole, 40; and if the stick splits off in a foramen palatinum, the game is won.
Three hundred or more counters are made of soapweed leaves split into narrow
pieces, 10 cm. long. The side which gets all the counters wins (Spier 1928:340â341).

Family Sciuridae (Squirrels and Allies)

Spermophilus sp. (Ground Squirrel) (n = 3)
Four ground squirrel species, including the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus
tridecemlineatus), eastern fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), eastern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans),
and black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), occur in the vicinity of the Mercado site,
41TR203 (Bailey 1931:109â117; Davis and Schmidley 1994:102â120; Findley et al. 1987:70â73;
Zeveloff 1988:131â142).
The thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) is a small ground squirrel
whose range is from northern Texas and in a corridor extending from Tarrant and Dallas counties
in north-central Texas south to Atascosa, Bee, and Calhoun counties along the Gulf Coast. They
prefer short-grass prairies. They live in burrows which radiate well-marked paths to their feeding
grounds. These squirrels are strictly diurnal, but their annual cycle of activity includes a very long
period of hibernation that lasts up to 240 days. Adults enter hibernation in July and the young in
August or September. They emerge from the middle of February to the first of March. Their diet is
green grasses and herbs but also includes seeds, flower heads, and insects. Generally, one litter is
produced annually with young numbering 2 to 13. The young are self-reliant after 6 weeks. They
mature sexually at about 9 to 10 months (Davis and Schmidly 1994:108â110).
Several groups hunted ground squirrels for food and other uses. Even early Euro-Americans ate
these animals and sometimes used the skins for clothing (Tomich 1982:202). Basin-Plateau groups
caught ground squirrels by pouring water into the burrows and capturing the animals as they tried
to escape. Digging sticks or rodent skewers were used to remove them from their burrows. They

were also smoked out. Away from their burrows, they were killed with deadfalls or were run down
and dispatched with sticks and stones (Lowie 1924:199; Steward 1938:40). âThe Tepehuan hunt
five species of squirrels that are killed either because they are edible or because they prey upon
newly planted corn fieldsâ (Pennington 1969:134). Two of these species are ground squirrels that
are either killed with bows and arrows or caught in a rock or basket trap (Pennington 1969:124).
The Sanpoil flooded ground squirrels out of their burrows and then killed them with clubs (Ray
1932:87). The Havasupai used deadfalls to kill squirrels. âTraps are placed on the rodent trails in
the fields and near storehouses to catch the squirrels and rats which root up the corn, tear their way
into the storehouses, etc.â (Spier 1928:113). The Yavapai caught ground squirrels in stone deadfall
traps. They also extracted them from their burrows with sticks (Gifford 1936:266â267). The
Miwok hunted squirrels mostly in the winter when they were fat. They were shot with bows and
arrows or captured by dogs (Barrett and Gifford 1933:137, 183).
The Miwok (Barrett and Gifford 1933: 183) and Havasupai (Spier 1928:117) did not preserve
squirrel meat, but rather prepared it for immediate consumption. If the animal was to be boiled, the
Havasupai first eviscerated it and removed the skin, head, and tail. If it was to be roasted, it was
only eviscerated (Spier 1928:117). The Yavapai cooked ground squirrels in an earth oven after they
eviscerated and skinned them (Gifford 1936:267). After the ground squirrels were skinned and
drawn, the Tepehuan roasted them either on spits or on coals (Pennington 1969:124). Great Basin
peoples prepared ground squirrels for consumption by first burning off their fur in an open fire.
âThey might then have been pit roasted whole, sometimes eviscerated and stuffed with wild onions.
Ground squirrelsâ¦were also boiled and pulverized in a mortar or on a metateâ (Fowler 1986:82).
Preparation of these animals included processing the bones and entrails (Fowler 1986:82).
In addition to eating the ground squirrel, the Yavapai used its skin for a tobacco bag:
Ground squirrels taken for food, normally skins not saved. August was the best time
to obtain squirrel skins for tobacco bags. Deadfall traps were used and were baited
with prickly pear. To skin the squirrel, cuts were made on the inside of both hind
legs and carried to the anal opening. No cut made full length of abdomen. Cuts in
the legs were later sewed, leaving openings 1 Â½ in. in diameter for the insertion of
tobacco. No brains used on squirrel skin, which was held in a workerâs lap or on his
leg and rubbed with a small stone (Gifford 1936:273).

Sciurus niger (Eastern Fox Squirrel)
The eastern fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) is a large tree squirrel whose range includes all of eastern
and central Texas. They are adapted to a wide variety of forest habitats, with open upland forests of
mixed trees being preferred, particularly mature oak-hickory woodland. Hollow trees are preferred
den sites, otherwise they build outside leaf nests consisting of leaves and twigs. A single fox
squirrel occupies an area of at least 4 ha in extent. Acorns are the mainstay diet and are buried in
the fall in individual caches for winter use. They also have a fondness for green corn. Mating
occurs in January and February and again in May and June. Females average four offspring per
year. Sexual maturity is attained in 10 to 11 months (Davis and Schmidly 1994:117â118).
Glaucomys volans (Eastern Flying Squirrel)
The eastern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) is a small squirrel with a flattened, bushy tail.
Flying squirrels do not actually fly but travel by gliding from one tree to another, with glides being
6â9 m in length. Its range is the eastern third of Texas with Tarrant County being near its western
boundary. These nocturnal squirrels inhabit forested areas where suitable trees are present to afford
den sites. They are sociable and tend to live together in groups. Holes in stumps are preferred den
sites, otherwise they utilize almost any cavity that is dry and large enough. Nuts and acorns are
their mainstay diet, but they also procure insect larvae, beetles, young and eggs of birds,
persimmon, and cultivated corn. Food is cached in holes in trees for winter use. Mating occurs in
February and March and again in July. Females average three to four offspring per year during a
single mating. Sexual maturity is attained in one year (Davis and Schmidly 1994:119â120).
The Yavapai caught tree squirrels in stone deadfall traps. After they were skinned, they were
roasted in an earth oven (Gifford 1936:267). The Navajo killed tree squirrels with bows and
arrows, skinned and cleaned them, and cooked them on hot coals. Sometimes caps were made from
the skins (Hill 1938:172). âThe skins were tanned and hung on cradles for the protection of babiesâ
(Hill 1938:172) in case of a fall. The Tepehuan killed tree squirrels with bows and arrows, with
stones thrown either by hand or with a sling, or by felling trees in which they were hiding. After the
squirrels were skinned and eviscerated, they were roasted either on a spit or on coals (Pennington
1969:124).

Cynomys ludovicianus (Black-tailed Prairie Dog)
The eastern boundary of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) range is in Tarrant
County (Davis and Schmidly 1994:114). It inhabits semi-arid, short-grass prairies, avoiding stands
of tall grass. It is a highly social animal that lives in very large colonies that can extend over large
expanses of plains. Family groups retain some cohesion and independence within the wellorganized colonies. Communication among colony members is both vocal and visual. A dome or
doughnut-shaped mound surrounds the entrance to the burrow which may extend almost vertically
to a depth of 5 m before leveling off. The entrance mound prevents water from entering the burrow.
Much of the winter is spent in the burrow. Breeding occurs in late winter, and a single litter of
about four young is born in late March and early April. The black-tailed prairie dog consumes the
stems, leaves, and seeds of a variety of grasses, weeds, and shrubs. The black-footed ferret, an
endangered species, was the most specialized predator of prairie dogs. Formerly, both species had
nearly identical distributions. Other predators include hawks, coyotes, foxes, bobcats, badgers, and
snakes (Davis and Schmidly 1994:112â115; Findley 1987:67â68; Findley et al. 1975:130â132;
Hoffmeister 1986:194â196; Zeveloff 1988:145, 147).
Prairie dogs are not known to store food in their burrows. During the summer, they are active early
in the morning and late in the afternoon. During the winter, they stay underground when it is very
cold. Although it is not known if they hibernate, they generally emerge from their burrows between
mid-February and late March. Prairie dog populations are periodically decimated by diseases, such
as plague (Findley 1987:68; Hoffmeister 1986:196â198; Pizzimenti and Hoffmann 1973:3;
Zeveloff 1988:145, 149â150).
Prairie dogs have a reputation as agricultural pests. Because they are believed to compete with
livestock for food on grasslands, eradication (e.g., poisoning) campaigns have been aimed at prairie
dogs. As a result, they have been extirpated throughout much of their range (Findley 1987:68;
Hoffmeister 1986:195; Zeveloff 1988:145, 150). However, these rodents are not as harmful as was
once maintained.
Because they tend to be most numerous on ranges that have already been
overgrazed by livestock, they could be a symptom rather than a cause of poor range
conditions. In fact, they may actually hasten the recovery of poor rangelands, for
they tend to feed on plants typical of a rangeâs early stages. This practice ultimately

238

encourages the growth of climax plant species, those appearing at the end of the
successional sequence. It is these climax plants which provide high-quality livestock
forage (Zeveloff 1988:145).
The burrowing activities of these mammals can severely impact buried cultural deposits if their
colonies are established in a buried site. The potential for faunal turbation is great.
The Hopi used deadfalls and snares to catch prairie dogs (Beaglehole 1936:17). Northern Shoshone
boys used their dogs to hunt prairie dogs (Lowie 1909:185). These animals were dug out of their
burrows, drowned out of their burrows, or shot with bows and arrows by the Navajo (Hill
1938:171).
Special arrows were used in hunting prairie dogs. These were unfeathered, and the
points had only one barb. (Formerly, when arrow points were found, one barb was
broken off, or bone points of this pattern were made. With the introduction of iron,
points of the same type were hammered out) (Hill 1938:171).
A piece of mica, placed in a split stick, was used by the Navajo to blind a prairie dog as it emerged
from its burrow. It was then shot and pulled out by means of a barbed arrow (Hill 1938:171â172).
After heavy rains, flood waters were directed into holes to drown out the prairie
dogs. Water was also carried to the holes for this purpose. The hole was first
plugged with manure and grass, and a basin built around it. When the basin was
filled, the plug was removed, allowing a large volume of water to descend into the
hole at one time (Hill 1938:172).
If several frightened prairie dogs ran into the same hole, the Navajo dug them out with a digging
stick. In addition, the Navajo used traps to catch these animals. Nooses attached to a rock or stake
were placed at the burrow entrances (Hill 1938:172). Similar methods were utilized by BasinPlateau groups to procure prairie dogs. âThey were either dug with a digging stick, pulled from
their burrows by means of a rodent skewer, smoked out, flooded out, or killed with deadfall trapsâ
(Steward 1938:40). The Yavapai caught prairie dogs in stone deadfall traps (Gifford 1936:266).
The Navajo generally used only one method for cooking prairie dogs. After the carcass was
cleaned, the liver, lungs, and fat were placed in the body cavity, and it was salted. The opening was

pinned closed with twigs. âThen the hair was singed in an open fire and the animal buried in the
ashes to roastâ (Hill 1938:172). The Yavapai cooked prairie dogs in hot ashes after first cleaning
and skinning them (Gifford 1936:266).
8.3.5.3

Family Geomyidae (Pocket Gophers)

Geomys bursarius (Plains Pocket Gopher) (n = 2)
Plains pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius), the only pocket gopher species occurring in the vicinity
of the Mercado site, 41TR203, typically inhabits sandy soils where the topsoil is 10 cm or more in
depth. Clayey soils are usually avoided. The pocket gopher is a highly fossorial rodent that lives a
solitary life almost entirely underground. Owls, hawks, snakes, badgers, weasels, foxes, and
coyotes are major predators. It subsists on a wide variety of herbaceous plants, grasses, bulbs,
tubers, roots, and cacti. In addition, it also consumes crops. Feeding tunnels parallel the surface and
average between 15 and 30 cm in depth (Bee et al. 1981:106; Hoffmeister 1986:223â224; Zeveloff
1988:161, 165). Depending on soil conditions, burrow systems can vary from less than 30 cm to
more than 1 m in depth (Felthauser and McInroy 1983:557). During the winter, pocket gophers also
burrow through the snow, depositing soil excavated from their underground burrows in the snow
tunnels (Hoffmeister 1986:225). Breeding occurs from February through August. Litters consist of
about 3 to 4 individuals. The young are born in a nest within the burrow. The nest may be as much
as 1.6 m deep (Davis and Schmidly 1994:126â127; Hoffmeister 1986:225).
Because the pocket gopher is highly fossorial, it mixes and deepens the soil. A single individual
can displace 1 to 3 or more tons of soil annually (Kennerly 1964:428; Richens 1966:533).
Consequently, the impact of faunal turbation via this rodent on the cultural deposits of
archeological sites yielding remains of this burrower should be considered. Recent research has
focused on the effects of pocket gopher burrowing activities on the distribution of archeological
materials (Bocek 1986; Erlandson 1984; Johnson 1989).
Several groups ate pocket gophers, including the Gosiute Shoshone (Steward 1938:138â139),
Navajo (Hill 1938:172), Tepehuan (Pennington 1969:124â125), and Plains Cree (Mandelbaum
1940:199). Pocket gophers and other small burrowing rodents were important sources of food for
the Basin-Plateau groups. In addition to using the hunting methods previously mentioned to obtain
prairie dogs, pocket gophers were also run down and killed with sticks and stones if they were

observed away from their burrows (Steward 1938:40). The Plains Cree caught gophers with snares.
âA sinew noose was placed over a gopherâs hole. The other end of the line was held by the snarer.
When a gopher appeared, the line was jerkedâ (Mandelbaum 1940:199). A similar technique was
used by the Gros Ventre (Kroeber 1908:149).
After the gophers were skinned and cleaned, the Gosiute Shoshone dried the meat without
removing the bones (Steward 1938:139). The Tepehuan skinned and cleaned the gophers before
they were either roasted on a spit or boiled with other meat (Pennington 1969:125). These rodents
also had nonfood functions. The Navajo drank a mixture consisting of water and gopher stomach
and flesh as a remedy for stomach aches (Hill 1938:172). Such a usage would not be visible in the
archeological record.
8.3.5.4

Family Castoridae (Beaver)

Castor canadensis (Beaver) (n = 8)
cf. Castor canadensis (Beaver) (n = 1)
C. canadensis/Erethizon dorsatum (Beaver/Porcupine) (n = 1)
At the time of European contact, beaver lived throughout North America, âexcept for the arctic
tundra, most of Florida, and the southwestern desertsâ (Zeveloff 1988:190). Intensive trapping
during the nineteenth century exterpated or reduced the beaver, a semi-aquatic mammal and the
largest extant rodent in North America, throughout much of its range by the early 1900s. As a
result of restocking programs since that time, beaver now thrive in much of their former range. In
terms of the Project area, beaver presently occur along the Trinity River and its tributaries
(Cockrum 1982:103; Findley et al. 1975:187; Hall and Kelson 1959:547; Hoffmeister 1986:319;
Zeveloff 1988:189).
The beaver is associated with permanent bodies of water. It is abundant along permanent
watercourses where its preferred foods, including cottonwoods, willows, aspens, or alders, are
plentiful. Non-woody vegetation, such as corn and various water plants, is also eaten. Food is
stored for winter consumption. Two types of house structures are constructed. One is the familiar
dome-shaped, mud and stick lodge surrounded by open water. The other is a bank house with an
underwater entrance, but the main chamber is above the high-water line. The dam is its other
Mercado Site (41TR203)

241

familiar construction. A single litter, usually of three or four young, is born in nests within the
houses in April or May. Besides humans, principal predators include coyotes, dogs, wolves,
bobcats, mountain lions, otters, and minks (Cockrum 1982:102; Findley et al. 1975:187â188;
Hoffmeister 1986:319â321; Jenkins and Busher 1979; Schwartz and Schwartz 1981:174â181;
Zeveloff 1988:189â192).
Historically, the beaver was exploited as a food resource and for its pelt. It was the mainstay of the
North American fur trade for almost three hundred years (~1550â1840). The Navajo obtained
beaver along the San Juan River. âReturning raiding parties passing there broke the dams and,
when the water drained out, dug the beaver from their holesâ (Hill 1938:170). Shaman headbands
were made from the skins. The castor was burned as incense in the Bead Way chant and was
burned and inhaled as a cure for bad colds (Hill 1938:170). Tonkawa men occasionally tied their
hair with beaver fur (Newcomb 1961:138). The Osage hunted beaver for meat and pelts (La
Flesche 1932:221; Mathews 1961:447). Prior to the appearance of the Euro-American, the
Cheyenne used dogs to hunt beaver for food and clothing (Grinnell 1923:I:295â296). The
Chippewa trapped beaver, the tail of which was considered a great delicacy due to its fat content
(Densmore 1929:44). The Crow made glue with the hide from a beaver tail (Lowie 1922:231).

Family Muridae (Mice and Rats)

Reithrodontomys sp. (Harvest Mouse) (n = 1)
Two species of harvest mice occur in the vicinity of the Mercado site, 41TR203, the plains harvest
mouse (Reithrodontomys montanus) and fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens).
These mice prefer to inhabit climax, or nearly climax, well-drained grasslands. Their nests are
composed of fine grass compacted into small balls and are either in bunch grass or just beneath the
ground in their burrows. Their diet consists of green parts and seeds of a variety of plants,
including small grains. They breed year-long with 2 to 5 per litter. They are sexually mature in
approximately 2 months (Davis and Schmidly 1994:159â165).

Sigmodon sp. (Cotton Rats) (n = 3)
Sigmodon hispidus (Hispid Cotton Rat) (n = 6)
The Hispid Cotton Rat (Sigmodon hispidus) occurs throughout the entire State of Texas. It is a
moderately large robust rat that inhabits tall-grass areas where such grasses as bluestem, cordgrass,
or sedges offer both freedom of movement under a protective canopy and an adequate food supply.
They form a network of interconnecting travel ways. They live in dens at the bases of small, low
clumps of mesquite in otherwise nearly barren terrain. Nests are built either in chambers off
underground burrows or above ground in dense clumps of grass, piles of brush, or other areas that
offer some concealment and protection. Nests are globular, about 12 cm in diameter and are
composed of shredded grasses and weeds. Their diet is almost exclusively plant material, but they
also feed on the eggs of ground-nesting birds. Their breeding is prolific, producing several litters of
2 to 10 young averaging five times per year. They are subject to violent fluctuations in populations
with eruptions in populations followed by crashes, usually as a result of disease (Davis and
Schmidly 1994: 188â189).
Neotoma sp. (Woodrat) (n = 1)
The Mercado site, 41TR203, is within the range of two woodrat (Neotoma) species, including
eastern woodrat (N. floridana) and southern plains woodrat (N. micropus). Each tends to occupy
different habitats. The Eeastern woodrat (N. floridana), found in the eastern third of Texas west to
Wichita, has a wide range of habitat that includes swamplands, forested uplands, and arid plains.
These rats do not construct surface nests, but rather live in burrows at the bases of trees. They
normally live in underground burrows with dens or build a large surface house at the base of a tree.
They also take over the burrows dug by other and larger animals. Their diet consists almost
exclusively of vegetable matter which provides both food and water. In east-central Texas, they
feed on acorns, yaupon berries, and the leaves of oaks, yaupon, French mulberry, green briar,
peppervine, rattan, and hackberry. The breeding season extends from January to September with
litters ranging from one to five and up to three litters annually. Major predators include owls,
snakes, ringtails, coyotes, badgers, bobcats, and weasels (Bailey 1931:175â180; Cockrum
1982:114â115; Davis 1974:221; Davis and Schmidly 1994:192â193; Findley 1987:97â100;
Findley et al. 1975:241â242; Hoffmeister 1986:406â407; Zeveloff 1988:209â210).

The southern plains woodrat (N. micropus) prefers xeric or semi-arid grasslands with thickets of
cacti, mesquite, or thornbush. It also inhabits crevices in rocky outcrops. Bulky, conspicuous
houses are commonly constructed of sticks, cactus joints, and thorns. These houses are built at the
base of shrubs and cacti or in rock outcrops. Protected within the house, the nest consists of dry
grasses and fine plant fibers. Within the structure, tunnels are used for food, resting chambers, and
escape routes. In addition, an underground burrow system may be present. Two or more litters, of
usually two or three young, are born from early spring until August. A variety of plant materials is
consumed, including leaves, seeds, roots, berries, and nuts. Prickly pear blades and various cacti
fruits are favored foods. Major predators include snakes, owls, hawks, coyotes, foxes, and bobcats
(Bee et al. 1981:140â141; Davis 1974:218â219; Findley 1987:97â100; Findley et al. 1975:238â

The woodrat is often called a âpack ratâ from its habit of collecting all sorts of objects, both
cultural and non-cultural, and incorporating them into the den or nest. This rodent can disturb the
artifact distribution patterns of a site and/or create pseudo-features (Hester and Hill 1980; Hoffman
and Hays 1987). Burned woodrat houses, including contents, look suspiciously like prehistoric
hearths (Hester and Hill 1980). Therefore, woodrats are a potential agent of faunal turbation at sites
in which their bones are found. However, the presence of woodrat bones in a siteâs faunal
assemblage is not necessarily indicative of intrusion. As suggested by ethnographic data, the
woodrat was exploited by several groups.
Woodrats were eaten by the Jicarilla Apache (Opler 1936:207), the Navajo (Bailey 1931:185; Hill
1938:173), Walapai (McGuire 1983:32), Basin-Plateau groups (Steward 1938:40, 83, 158), Kiliwa
(Michelsen 1967:74), Yavapai (Gifford 1932:205, 1936:266), and Chiricahua Apache (Opler
1941:325). This rodent was a staple in the diet of peoples in southern Texas (Hester and Hill
1980:318). Ethnographic literature also mentions unspecified rats (possibly woodrats) as having
been consumed by groups such as the Omaha (Fletcher and La Flesche 1911:104) and Tonkawa
(Newcomb 1961:139). The flesh of this rodent has been described as âtender, sweet, and delicious
as young rabbit or quailâ (Bailey 1931:180).
Basin-Plateau groups used woodrat hunting techniques similar to those for ground squirrels and
prairie dogs (Steward 1938:40). The Navajo killed woodrats after digging them from their nests
(Hill 1938:173). The Chiricahua, working in pairs, procured woodrats with a different technique.

While a hunter poked a stick into a nest opening, another hunter waited for the prey at the other
opening. When it came out, it was shot with a headless arrow that had a sharpened shaft.
Sometimes the woodrats were hit with a stick when they tried to escape from the nest (Opler
1941:325). The Hopi utilized deadfalls and snares to catch rats (Beaglehole 1936:17). The Kiliwa
poked a pole into the nest. When the frightened animal attempted to flee, it was stomped by a
hunting companionâs feet, killed with rocks, or shot with an arrow. If the woodrat refused to
emerge, the nest was burned (Michelsen 1967:75). A hooked stick was used by the Walapai to
remove woodrats from their nests (McGuire 1983:32). The Yavapai employed several methods for
procuring woodrats. Stone deadfall traps were used. Woodrat nests in cacti or bushes were pulled
apart with the curved end of 6- to 8-ft sticks. The rats were killed as they tried to escape. In
addition, the hunters took the piÃ±on nuts stored in the nests. Woodrats were also forced from their
nests by poking the straight end of the long sticks into their nests. The woodrats were killed with
bows and arrows or with sticks. If a hunter seized a woodrat by its neck with his bare hands, the
rodent was struck against the rocks to kill it (Gifford 1932:217, 1936:266). The Tepehuan trapped
woodrats with an inverted, tilted earthenware bowl âsupported by a figure-four release mechanism
and baited with a few grains corn or wheat (Pennington 1969:125).
Michelsen (1967:76) provides a detailed description of the preparation of a woodrat for
consumption by the Kiliwa:
Preparations for eating are quick and efficient. First a fire is built of small
branches. While the flames are high the whole animal is tossed into the fire. When
the hair is well singed the rat is removed with a pair of sticks, used as tongs, and
placed on a branch of fresh juniper or some similar evergreen. The skin, partially
cooked, slips off cleanly and easily. The entrails are removed and the rat laid on the
green boughs. After the flakes of the fire have died down sufficiently the carcass is
placed on the coals to roast for 10 or 15 minutes.
The most remarkable part of the procedure takes place after the meat is cooked. The
legs are pulled off and nibbled in the classic manner. However, the rib cage, spine
and pelvis are placed on a flat rock, sometimes a metate, and thoroughly crushed
with a hammerstone. The carcass, well shredded, is then eaten, bones and all
(Michelsen 1967:76).

After singing off the fur, Great Basin groups pit-roasted wood rats whole or eviscerated them and
stuffed them with wild onions (Fowler 1986:82). The Yavapai prepared wood rats for consumption
in several ways. They either boiled them whole or after removal of the intestines. After skinning
and eviscerating the wood rats, the Yavapai placed the skin in the abdominal cavity and baked the
carcass under ashes. The skin was consumed as a delicacy. Wood rats also were preserved for short
periods for later consumption. In that case, they were slightly charred after skinning and were hung
in the hut in bundles of 20 or 30. They could be kept this way for a few days, and when they were
to be eaten, they were boiled (Gifford 1936:266). After skinning and cleaning the woodrats, the
Tepehuan roasted them either on a spit or over coals (Pennington 1969:125).
Woodrats had other cultural uses. The Navajo sometimes used woodrat fur in incense (Hill
1938:173). A subsistence strategy of the Pawnee indirectly exploited woodrats. In the fall, women
collected part of these rodentsâ wild bean and potato hoards, leaving a portion for the woodratsâ
consumption (Weltfish 1977:321, 415â416). The Yavapai also raided woodrat nests for piÃ±on nuts.
Woodrat brains were preserved for skin dressing, and their skins, with the fur side in, were used as
infant winter foot wrappings (Gifford 1936:257, 266, 275). The woodrat remains recovered from
LA 151618 are considered cultural.

Family Canidae (Dogs, Coyotes, Wolves, Foxes)

Canis sp. (Dog/Coyote) (n = 7)
Dog/coyote (Canis familiaris/C. latrans) remains consisting of teeth, a pelvis, and a tibia were
recovered from the Mercado site. The dog is associated closely with humans. Based on a
radiocarbon date of about 8400 B.C., the earliest known domestic dog remains in North America
came from Jaguar Cave, Lemhi County, Idaho (Lawrence 1967:44). âSince dogs were
domesticated from an Old World, not a New World stock, and since the remains discussed are of a
small animal with typical dog characters, domestication must have taken place at a considerably
earlier dateâ (Lawrence 1967:44). When humans entered North America, dogs accompanied them.
The domestic dog probably descended from the wolf (C. lupus). As Olsen believes:
The wolf has perfected hunting habits that would not have been lost on early human
hunters who observed their game-getting practices. Both wolves and humans were
pack, or team, hunters early on, and it is likely that these similar tactics for

obtaining prey were influential in bringing about the initial stages of association
between the two species. This hunting association and the fact that both hominids
and large canids have mutually compatible social organizations eventually led to
taming and, ultimately, to domestication (1985:xi).
Pre-Columbian dog remains in North America fall into at least four size categories: 1) a large wolflike northern form; 2) the Plains Indian dog (known in the Southwest as the large Pueblo dog), 3)
the small short-faced Pueblo dog; and 4) the small long-faced Pueblo dog (Allen 1920:503; Olsen
1974:343, 1985:35). As Solis (1931:61) records, the Caddo had hybrid dogs, called jubines, that
were dog, coyote, or wolf mixtures.
When Spanish explorers first entered the American Southwest, Spanish greyhounds, used to control
local populations, accompanied them. These dogs were larger than coyotes and large Pueblo dogs
but smaller than the local wolf (Olsen 1978:19; Winship 1990:34). On several occasions during the
Coronado entrada (ad 1540â1542), greyhounds were used in dog-baiting episodes. In an effort to
force Bigotes and Cacique to reveal the whereabouts of a supposed golden bracelet, dogs were set
on them, but the victims were not injured seriously (Bolton 1990:200, 203). In an incident that
occurred either during the siege or after the fall of Moho in early ad 1541, some freed Indians were
chased and bitten by a Spanish dog. As in the previous incident, no one died (Bolton 1990:228).
During De Sotoâs expedition into what is now the southeastern United States, Spanish dogs served
similar functions. Bloodhounds were used âin tracking down Indians, retrieving those who tried to
escape and tearing in pieces guides who misledâ (Swanton 1939:92). As settlers moved into New
Mexico, so did various domestic dog breeds.
Dogs were (and in some cases still are) used by many groups for hunting, as beasts of burden, and
at least occasionally, as food. Although not specifically trained for hunting, Hopi dogs were
sometimes used to run down game. Puppies or older dogs also were butchered and fed to captive
eagles and hawks when rabbit meat was unavailable (Beaglehole 1936:8, 21). The Havasupai
sometimes used dogs for hunting rabbits and deer (Spier 1928:113). The Navajo used dogs âfor
hunting when no ritual was involved. They were trained to track and follow wounded animals.
Some were castrated. They were never eatenâ (Hill 1938:97). The Navajo still use dogs to guard
their sheep. The Yavapai occasionally ate dogs. They were either cooked in an earth oven or boiled.
Dogs also were used for hunting fawns and wounded deer (Gifford 1932:205, 217â218, 1936:264).

A unique Yavapai custom involved dogs and teeth. To ensure healthy permanent teeth, the first
deciduous tooth lost by a child was either encased in food and fed to a dog or thrown toward the
east by the childâs father (Gifford 1936:300). Dogs occasionally were eaten by the Miwok, who
sometimes used them to hunt squirrels and deer. After Euro-American contact, the Miwok used dog
skins for quivers (Barrett and Gifford 1933:219, 270). Among the Tepehuan, âdogs constitute an
important element in individual or communal hunting, and good hunting dogs are highly prizedâ
(Pennington 1969:119).
Among the Arikara, the flesh of young dogs was served during a feast, such as that of the Buffalo
Society observed by Gilmore in 1926 (Gilmore 1934). Arikara methods of killing and butchering
dogs on such occasions were different from those of other groups. The hostâs wife did the killing,
dressing, and cooking. She seized the dog by its hind legs and whirled it several times in a vertical
circle. Then she struck its head and back on the ground with enough force to stun the animal. While
in this condition, she placed a foot on its neck, suffocating it. Supposedly, the swinging made the
dog dizzy and lessened its pain when it hit the ground. After the dog was dead, the hostâs wife laid
it on a fire and turned it until the hair was singed off. Then she washed the carcass with water to
remove the singed hair. She began the actual butchering process by slitting the carcass from throat
to tail. The viscera were removed and discarded along with the head and tail, which were severed
next. The dressed carcass, with its skin still on it, was divided into portions according to wellestablished traditions (Gilmore 1934:37â38). âThese portions are the two forequarters, the two
hindquarters, the two sets of ribs, the cervical and dorsal vertebrae with adjacent bones and muscles
between the shoulders, and the lumbar vertebrae with the bones and muscles which form the pelvic
girdleâ (Gilmore 1934:38). Then the portions were cut into small pieces and boiled.
Coyotes (C. latrans) occur throughout the Southwest, occupying a wide range of habitats. The
coyote is found throughout New Mexico, but it is most common in grassland. It subsists primarily
on animal matter (Cockrum 1982:24â25; Findley et al. 1975:281). âBroken country, interrupted by
rocks, brush, clumps of piÃ±on-juniper or other vegetation, makes excellent habitat for coyotesâ
(Hoffmeister 1986:462). Dens usually are in the ground. Brush-covered slopes, riverbanks, and
rock ledges serve as den sites. Unlike wolves, coyotes normally do not mate for life. A single litter,
of usually 5 or 6 pups, is born in the spring. Much of the coyote diet consists of rabbits, rodents,
and carrion, but birds, sheep, deer, juniper berries, cactus fruit, and insects are also eaten. To
protect their livestock, ranchers have killed thousands of coyotes, but programs to eradicate these

canids generally have been ineffective. Coyotes are also hunted for their valuable pelts. The
coyoteâs major nonhuman predators are cougars and wolves (Findley et al. 1975:281â282; Bee et
al. 1981:165; Cockrum 1982:24; Hoffmeister 1986:464; Zeveloff 1988:248â249).
The Yavapai ate coyotes when deer were scarce, using large deadfall traps to catch them. After
they eviscerated and skinned the canid, they either cooked it in an earth oven or boiled it. They did
not eat its marrow (Gifford 1932:205, 216, 1936:266). Some Plains groups, such as the Cheyenne,
also ate coyotes (Grinnell 1923:I:256). Although the Tepehuan did not eat coyotes, they hunted
them because coyotes kill chickens and consume young cornstalks. Some hunting techniques made
use of bows and arrows or pit traps (Pennington 1969:127).
Although coyotes were occasional food resources, they were probably sought more for their pelts.
Currently, they are still a valuable furbearer (Carbyn 1987:372). Although the Hopi did not eat
coyotes, they caught them with deadfall traps and used their skins (Beaglehole 1936:17â18). The
Navajo used several types of deadfall traps to obtain coyote skins for the Coyote Way chant
(Hill 1938:168â170). The Yavapai used coyote skins without the legs for capes, robes, and
blankets, and also made quivers from coyote hides (Gifford 1932:226, 1936:273, 286). The hides
were dried inside out. âThen moist earth was applied and the skin worked with the hands to soften
itâ (Gifford 1932:223). As a variation, the hide was softened by rubbing it with a stone. Then it was
buried in damp ground for less than a day. Brains were unnecessary for processing coyote hides.
Just four or five skins sewn together made a robe (Gifford 1932:223, 226, 1936:273, 286). The
Havasupai tracked coyotes in the snow to obtain their pelts for robes and bedding (Spier 1928:111).
The Tepehuan used coyote skins as sleeping mats (Pennington 1969:127). Coyote pelts were used
for robes and blankets by the Sanpoil (Ray 1932:86), Northern Shoshone (Lowie 1909:179), and
Havasupai (Spier 1928:111), among others. The Sanpoil made quivers from coyote skins (Ray
1932:89). The dog/coyote remains recovered from the Mercado site are those of an adult and are
considered cultural.

Definite deer specimens (n = 156) are the highest identified taxon in the Mercado site vertebrate
archaeofaunal assemblage. Historically, two deer species, including mule deer (Odocoileus
hemionus) and white-tailed deer (O. virginianus), occurred in or near the vicinity of the Mercado
site (Findley et al. 1985:329, 331). The mule deer, a browser, is found at all elevations and in a
variety of habitatsâbrushy and wooded areas, broken country, and open plains. It inhabits the
Upper Sonoran, Transition, and Canadian zones (Bailey 1913:32, 43, 47). As a result, a varied diet
is consumed. It is a browser that feeds mainly on oak, juniper, piÃ±on, cliffrose, bitterbrush, fir,
ponderosa pine, and aspen. When grazing, forbs are preferred over grasses. Cultivated crops are
also consumed. The winter diet primarily consists of juniper, piÃ±on needles, sagebrush, saltbush,
and Mormon tea. Formerly, major predators included grizzly bears and wolves. Mountain lions,
coyotes, bobcats, and eagles also prey on mule deer (Bee et al. 1981:220â221; Cockrum and
Petryszyn 1992:164; Davis and Schmidly 1994:278â283; Findley 1987:140â141; Findley et al.
1975:328â329; Hoffmeister 1986:542â543; Zeveloff 1988:326â327).
The white-tailed deer also inhabits the Upper Sonoran, Transition, and Canadian zones (Bailey
1913:32, 1931:35, 37). In areas where both species live close together, white-tailed deer usually
occur at higher elevations and in more rugged terrain, âsuch as steep, rocky, canyon sidesâ (Findley
et al. 1975:330). During summer, white-tailed deer may be found as high as 10,000 ft (Findley et
al. 1975:332). This species is âfound primarily in woodland communities consisting of evergreen
oaks or in mixtures of oak-juniper-pinyonâ (Hoffmeister 1986:545). White-tailed deer also occur in
desert scrub. Juniper, piÃ±on, hackberry, mesquite, and other bushes and shrubs supply much of
their diet. They also eat crops, such as corn. Predators of adult white-tailed deer and/or fawns
include coyotes, wolves, bobcats, mountain lions, gray foxes, and raptors (Hoffmeister 1986:545,
547â548; Zeveloff 1988:329â330).
Usually, only male deer have antlers, which are shed in early February at the end of the breeding
season. New antlers begin growing in May and remain in velvet until sometime in September when
they stop growing. Breeding takes place from late fall to early winter, primarily from December 1
through January 15. Does usually mate for the first time when they are about 18 months old. Deer
are K-selected mammals. As a result, the gestation period is almost 7 months.
In pre-Columbian and early historical times, deer were important food resources and also provided
raw materials for clothing and tools. Deer were one of the principal animals hunted by the Jicarilla

Apache. âWhistles, designed to imitate the bleat of the fawn, were used to draw does to their death,
and head nooses were strung along trailsâ (Opler 1936:207). Individuals and small parties of
Omaha hunted deer, usually in winter when the deer were fat and in good condition (Fletcher and
La Flesche 1911:270â271). The Chippewa had several deer hunting techniques, such as using pitch
torches and deer calls. The deer were attracted to the light and a sound similar to that of a fawn
(Densmore 1929:128â129, 149). Individual Sanpoil hunters had a similar technique, using a leaf to
imitate fawn sounds. Deer hunting by the Sanpoil was mainly a group venture that often occurred
during winter and consisted of driving deer to the head of a canyon or valley or into a river where
the animals were easily killed. They also drove deer over the edge of a cliff (Ray 1932:77â81).
Prior to the acquisition of the horse, the Hopi, working in pairs, sometimes ran down individual
deer on foot. More often, however, a group of hunters surrounded and rounded up a number of
deer. Although the hunters sometimes killed the exhausted animals with arrows, they usually
strangled them (Beaglehole 1936:3â7). Navajo hunters drove deer into an ambush, tracked them
down, waited in ambush for the animals to pass by, stalked deer, used animal disguises,
occasionally encircled deer with fire, used pit falls, and ran them down on foot (Hill 1938:96â133;
Elmore 1953). Some Basin-Plateau groups killed deer with poisoned arrows (Steward 1938:36).
The importance of deer as a raw material source for clothing, tools, and other items is well known
and needs no discussion. Several cultural customs associated with deer, however, are presented.
The Jicarilla Apache gathered the waste and bones of deer and disposed of them far from camp to
ensure continued success in hunting (Opler 1936:207). When the Navajo obtained sufficient deer
meat, they broke the accumulated bones. âNot a single one was left whole, because it was believed
that by breaking the bones deer hunted in the future would be unable to escape. These bones and
the horns were deposited at the base of a cliff roseâ (Hill 1938:128). The Hopi did not break the
bones for marrow or give them to their dogs, but rather placed the bones (including the skulls) and
unused antlers on a shrine (Beaglehole 1936:7â8). The Laguna cooked the head and bones in a
large cooking jar (Goldfrank 1954:419), and the Kiliwa ground deer bones to a fine paste in a
mortar (Michelsen 1967:77). All of the deer remains recovered from the Mercado site are
considered cultural.

Family Antilocapridae (Pronghorn)

Antilocapra americana (Pronghorn) (n = 6)
cf. Antilocapra americana (Pronghorn) (n = 2)
Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) formerly occurred throughout the Southwest, but intensive
hunting greatly reduced their numbers by the early 1900s. The eastern boundary of the present
range is just east of Tarrant County. Since the early 1900s, they have been expanding within their
former range. Pronghorn were once almost as numerous as bison. They inhabit arid and semi-arid
grasslands, subsisting on browse such as sagebrush, buckbrush, and rabbitbrush. Prickly pear cacti,
forbs, grasses, and cultivated crops are also eaten. Most, or all, of the necessary water is obtained
from the plants consumed. Pronghorn congregate in large herds (e.g., 100 individuals) during the
winter but disperse into smaller groups in the spring. Breeding occurs in the fall. Does give birth,
usually to twins, in mid-June. The pronghorn uses its great speed (up to 60 miles per hour) to elude
predators such as bobcats and coyotes (Findley 1987:144â145; Findley et al. 1975:333â334;
Hoffmeister 1986:549, 551â552; Jones et al. 1985:318; Zeveloff 1988:334â336).
The pronghorn served as a food resource for many North American pre-Columbian and historic
peoples. The Cheyenne dug pits and built enclosures on established trails where large numbers of
pronghorn were enticed, drawn, led, or driven and killed with clubs (Grinnell 1923:I:277â290).
Solitary Chiricahua Apache hunters stalked pronghorn (Opler 1941:324). Pronghorn was the
Navajoâs second most important meat source. Many deer hunting techniques also served to bring
down pronghorn. Animals were stalked, tracked, flushed, driven into an ambush, run down, or
driven into a corral by a pair or group of Navajo hunters, but impounding was the most common
method (Hill 1938:101â113, 117â131, 145â156). The Hopi also relied on deer hunting methods to
hunt pronghorn, and they treated the bones in a similar manner (Beaglehole 1936:4â9). The Pima
stalked pronghorn (Ebeling 1986:594). During the summer and fall, the Sanpoil often found
pronghorn near water holes, where one or two men using bows and arrows hunted them together
(Ray 1932:82). The Shoshone and Crow conducted communal pronghorn drives into corrals
(Lowie 1922:211; Steward 1938:34â35, 81â82). The Havasupai occasionally wore a disguise when
stalking pronghorn. âThe stuffed headskin of an antelope is worn on the head, while the body is
painted pink and white to resemble that animal. Mimicking its actions, the hunter approaches
within ten or fifteen meters before he lets fly (Spier 1928:110). The Yavapai hunted pronghorn by

stalking, driving, or surrounding them. In addition to eating the meat of this animal, they also
consumed the marrow (Gifford 1932:216, 1936:265).
Pronghorn also were a raw material resource for various material culture items of many groups.
The Yavapai used pronghorn skins for leggings, breechcloths, and drumheads, but because
pronghorn skin is thin and easily torn, they did not use it for all the same purposes as they used
deer hides (Gifford 1936:273â274, 288). The Yavapai also used the horns as flakers (Gifford
1936:287). The Havasupai made ropes from pronghorn skin (Spier 1928:146), and the Hopi used
the horn as an arrow wrench (Spier 1928:161). The Navajo made clothes from pronghorn hides, but
the hides were not sturdy enough for moccasins (Hill 1938:156). All the pronghorn specimens
recovered from the Mercado site are considered cultural.

Family Bovidae (Bovids)

Bison bison (Bison) (n = 46)
cf. Bison bison (Bison) (n = 4)
Bison remains were recovered from the Late Archaic components from the Mercado site (see
Table 8.1). The bison, the largest extant terrestrial mammal in North America, was formerly the
dominant mammal of the prairies. This grazer of open grasslands once numbered in the millions,
but it has been extirpated throughout most of its range. By 1890, less than 1,000 bison were left in
North America. Extermination of the bison was part of a United States government policy to
suppress the Indian tribes that depended on them for food, clothing, and shelter. At the turn of the
century, efforts were finally made to save them from extinction (Zeveloff 1988:345). Today, almost
100,000 live in public and private herds in western North America.
Although the bison is primarily a grassland species, it also occurs along forest edges and in the
prairie-forest transition zone. This bovid is very gregarious, living in large herds. Core herds
consist of females, calves, yearlings, and 2-year-olds. Older males are solitary or form small groups
on the peripheries of the main herds. During the breeding season, from mid to late summer, the
males join the female-subadult herds. Bison are a K-selected species. After a gestation period of
approximately 9.5 months, a single precocil calf per breeding female is usually born in the spring.
Occasionally, a female may have twins. Although sexual maturity is attained by the age of 3 for

both sexes, males generally do not breed much until the age of 6 (Bee et al. 1981:229â230; Findley
1987:146; Zeveloff 1988:346â347).
Bison are efficient grazers. They are âcapable of growing and maintaining good condition on less
nutritious fare than domestic cattle requireâ (Findley 1987:146). Although grasses are preferred,
sedges and brushy plants are consumed when grass is unavailable. Bison seek water each day.
During droughts, however, they can go several days without water. Besides humans, major
predators include wolves and grizzly bears (Bailey 1931:16; Bee et al. 1981:230; Findley
1987:146; Zeveloff 1988:346).
Large quantities of burned bone and unidentified bone raises the possibility that intensive bone
processing occurred at the site. Ethnographic data indicate marrow extraction and bone grease
processing were undertaken by many groups (Binford 1978; Densmore 1929:44; Grinnell
1923:I:216; Lowie 1922:214; Mandelbaum 1940:193; Peale 1871; Ray 1932:107; Wilson
1924:174; Wissler 1910:22â23). Mainly, the bones of large game animals such as bison, deer, elk,
caribou, and bear were processed for marrow and bone grease, but the bones of smaller animals,
such as rabbits, were also processed for grease by some groups (Densmore 1929:44). Besides being
a primary source of food, bison were a raw material resource for various material culture items of
many groups, which is well documented in the ethnographic literature and will not be dealt with
further here. All the bison specimens recovered from the Mercado site are considered cultural.
Given the groupings above, subsistence would have been focused on medium or larger mammals.
Small mammals were not widely selected. Very small mammals and microtines within the
assemblage are likely intrusive or naturally occurring. However, coprolite studies from the Lower
Pecos indicate cotton rats, voles, and other rodents were commonly consumed by Native
Americans (Bryant 1974; Reinhard and Bryant 1992; Texas Beyond History 2013).
An analysis of MNI indicates similar reliance as NISP. For the most part, only one bone, or no
more of any one element was present for most species. In those cases, the MNI was determined to
be 1. The mammal genus with the greatest MNI is deer. Due to the potential for both white-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) to be present, any bone not
identifiable to species per Jacobson (2004) or exhibiting either characteristics of both species or
indeterminate characteristics was left as a broader deer determination (Odocoileus sp.). Only one
bone was identifiable as mule deer, (O. hemionus), but 15 bones exhibited characteristics
Mercado Site (41TR203)

254

July 2019

identifiable as white-tailed deer (O. virginianus). Therefore, MNI for mule deer is equal to 1, but
MNI for white-tailed deer is two based on the presence of two right distal humeri. In addition, for
deer unassignable to species (Odocoileus sp.) there were two left nearly complete/complete petrous
portions, two right petrous portions (one complete and one posterior half), two upper left third
molars, and two right distal humeri (one adult and one fetal). While an argument could be made
that most of the specimens used to establish general deer MNI may represent unassignable to
species specimens from the two white-tailed deer MNI already established, the presence of sameside distal humeri mean that no fewer than four deer (inclusive of mule deer, white-tailed deer, and
general unassignable to species deer) are represented at the site. Furthermore, by using specimens,
such as teeth (e.g., an un-erupted lower third molar and deciduous lower fourth premolar), wear
patterns on a lower third molar and upper third premolar, heavy wear on a lower fourth premolar
and upper third molar, and a fetal bone, it is possible to establish the presence of deer from at least
four distinct age groups: 1) fetal; 2) 4 to 5 months of age; 3) 3 to 3.5 years of age; and 4) 6 to 6.5
years of age, resulting in an MNI of at least four individuals.
Bovid bone was identified to bison if clear indicators following Balkwill and Cumbaa (1992) were
present on the bone, although it is assumed, due to the radiocarbon-dated stratified deposits, the
bovid bone represents bison. Any bovine bone associated with AUs 2 through 8 (below the plowzone and deeper) can be assumed to be bison based on stratigraphic context and age. One bone, the
proximal half of a metacarpal, was examined for being cow (Bos taurus), since its characteristics
were identified based on Balkwill and Cumbaa, however (characteristics 3, 4, and 5) vary from 57
to 88 percent accurate, therefore there is a substantial possible error, especially given its
stratigraphic context with Feature 34 in AU 8, a well-dated Late Archaic context.
One left complete second to third fused carpal was examined using the defining characteristics of
Balkwill and Cumbaa (1992) where only 57 percent accuracy for bison was achieved for
character 1, 46 percent accuracy for cow for character 2, and 59 percent accuracy for bison and 72
percent accurate for being cow for character 3. There are similar sized cf. bison carpals within the
same stratigraphic contextand it is possible that all of the carpals are from the same individual.
Therefore, identifying domesticated cow within the assemblage is very weak, and all the identified
bovine specimens are considered bison. Bison MNI is equal to 2 based on two left astragali, two
left distal humeri, two left ulnar carpals, two left second to third fused carpals, and two left upper
third molars.
Mercado Site (41TR203)

255

Similar to deer, some of the specimens could not be assigned specifically to species and were left at
a broader designation of bovidae. The MNI of 2 for bovidae is based on two left calcanei.
Medium-size mammals, such as canid- and beaver-size, are represented by an MNI of 1.
The small mammal presence is higher based on an MNI for cottontail (Sylvilagus sp.) of 4 based on
four right distal humeri. In addition to the cottontail, the MNI for jackrabbit (Lepus sp.) is 2 based
on two right astragali. Overall, at least six lagomorphs (four cottontail and two jackrabbits) are
represented in the site assemblage.
MNI for very small rodents indicates a minor presence at the site. The pocket gopher (Geomys sp.)
MNI is 2 based on two right proximal ulnas. The Hispid cottonrat (Sigmodon hispidis) MNI of 3 is
based on three left mandibles, but Sigmodon sp. is assigned an MNI of one based on one left
mandible, therefore the MNI for all cotton rats is 4.
8.4

The Vertebrate Faunal Assemblage

The vertebrate faunal assemblage recovered from site 41TR203 consists of 8,346 specimens. A
variety of taxa was identified (see Table 8.1), some of which are considered intrusive. Most of the
assemblage consists of mammals (n = 7,174, 86.0 percent). The second largest category consists of
indeterminate vertebrate remains (n = 1,080, 12.9 percent). Reptiles (n = 73) represent 0.9 percent,
birds (n = 16) represent 0.2 percent, and amphibians (n = 1), indeterminate amphibian/reptile (n =
1), and fish (n = 1) each represent < 0.1 percent. The identified taxa and the NISP and minimum
MNI for each taxon are listed in Table 8.1 and represent that for the site as a whole. Summaries of
material recovered from the site as a whole and discussions regarding environment and subsistence
strategies, taphonomy, cultural bone modifications, and interpretations are discussed in the
following sections, along with a discussion of the same topics divided by AU.
In general, less than 50 percent of bones from Texas assemblages are identifiable to class, and in
this case, 87.1 percent (n = 7,266) was identified which is above the norm. The assemblage is
dominated by deer-size and larger mammals. Of the 8,346 vertebrate remains identified, 85 (1.0
percent) are complete and unbroken. This low percentage of complete, unbroken bones is similar to
other well-preserved sites in Texas.

Mercado Site (41TR203)

256

For comparison, the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235) has one of the more well-preserved
archeological faunal assemblages in Texas and is located in a similar open (non-rockshelter)
alluvial setting in Williamson County (Baker 1998). Of the 15,309 vertebrate remains recovered
from 1/4-in screens, only 30 percent were identifiable to class or a more specific taxon. Of the
38,618 specimens recovered from 1/8-inscreens, only 32 percent were identifiable to class or a
more specific taxon. Only 0.7 percent of the 1/4-in screened and 0.6 percent of the â-in screened
bone were complete and unbroken.
In contrast, although the assemblage at Fish Creek Slough (41DL436) in Dallas County was not as
fragmented as most regional faunal assemblages, only 53.1 percent of the 8,701 bones were
identifiable to class. The site, however, had much greater faunal diversity, with mammals only
representing 68 percent of the assemblage. Consequently, identification of the numerous small
bone fragments to class was more complicated. Of the Fish Creek Slough assemblage, 435 bones
(5 percent) were complete, unbroken specimens, which is greater than the complete, unbroken
specimens from the Mercado site. Given the good preservation and stratigraphic context of bone
recovered, the faunal assemblage data are informative with regards to environment, subsistence
strategies, butchering and processing, cultural bone modification, and taphonomic conditions.
8.4.1

Environment

Due to the lack of diversity of species present there is limited habitat information available.
However, there were a wide range of habitats utilized by the prehistoric occupants of site 41TR203
over its Late Archaic, Transitional Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric, and Late Prehistoric
cultural/temporal periods of use. White-tailed deer, fox, and squirrel are indicative of forest or
forest-edge (Schmidly 1994). Mule deer, cottontail rabbits, and jack rabbits prefer shrub
brush/chaparral habitats (Schmidly 1994; NRCS 1999). Bison, pronghorn, hispid cotton rat, harvest
mouse, and pocket gopher are indicative of open prairie and grassland. Beaver, goose, duck, other
waterfowl, water snake, pond turtles, red-eared sliders, and catfish all inhabit aquatic/wetlands
(Peterson 1988; Schmidly 1994; Stebbins 2003).
Some of the terrestrial species present in the assemblage can inhabit multiple environs as
represented by ecotones within the above habitats, such as prairie or brush (e.g., ground squirrel
and hispid cotton rat) and grassland or creek bottoms (e.g., harvest mouse). While overall, the
species present are diverse and representative of multiple habitats, they are consistent with a single

ecotone of grassland with adjacent riparian habitat. More notable, however, are how these
environmental indicators vary when broken down by AU and associated within their temporal
components (Table 8.2).

Data on Seasonality

There were numerous indicators for seasonal use of the site. The presence of reptiles, especially
turtle, although minimal (n = 73, 1 percent of total assemblage), indicate the site was used during
warmer seasons with temperatures above 38 to 45 Â°F (temperature at which most species of turtles
hibernate), likely between spring to late fall (i.e., March to November) (National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] 2013; Roots 2006). Many amphibians and reptiles will
estivate during times of drought, which in Texas can be an indicator of seasonality as mid-summer
typically has lower rainfall, but given the proximity of the West Fork of the Trinity River and
perennial drainage, limits of species availability due to seasonal estivation cannot be assumed.
While antlers were recovered from the site, typically antlers are not necessarily indicative of human
subsistence and hunting as deer antlers are shed annually and were a highly sought-after resource
for tool manufacture. There was one antler fragment consistent with being near the end of its course
of velvet at time of death. The antler fragment suggests a late summer or early fall presence, or
immediately prior to the rutting season (SeptemberâOctober) based on typical antler development
of present-day Texas deer (Brown 1994; Jacobson 1994; Marchinton and Miller 1994; Schmidly
1994).

Mercado Site (41TR203)

259

July 2019

Other indicators for seasonality using deer are available due to the presence of fetal and a 4- to
5-month-old fawn (Odocoileus sp.). The fetal bone is represented by a distal humeri consistent in
size with comparative material from a maternal April death in Tennessee. Given the difference in
timing of parturition between white-tailed deer in Tennessee (late May to June) and Texas (May to
early June), the maternal death associated with the fetal bones likely occurred around mid to late
March in Texas. Additionally, two lower un-erupted third molar fragments and the wear on a
deciduous fourth premolar indicate the presence of a 4- to 5-month-old fawn based on eruption and
wear patterns (Cain and Wallace 2003). Deer reproductive cycles are based on annual
photoperiodic cues set based on the location of their birth. Given modern and historic reproductive
cycles for white-tailed deer in the Dallas area (Jacobson 1994), this suggests seasonal occupation
sometime between late September to November. Therefore, based on deer alone, there are multiple
seasons of occupation at the site, including spring and fall.
Seasonal bird migration and presence/absence of these species at a site can also be used to determine season of use by human occupants. In Texas, however, the presence of migrating waterfowl at
the site is not typically conclusive as there are species of ducks that are resident year-round in the
state. One exception to this, the presence of Canada geese (Branta canadensis), would suggest a
winter presence at the site between October and March, although there are some geese that linger
longer in Texas.
Therefore, while most indicators above effectively suggest occupation of the site during moderate
temperature months (early spring through late fall), there is also evidence for mid-summer and
winter use of the site, although more minimal. Given the deep temporal use of the site, seasonal
indicators will also be examined within each AU and cultural/temporal affiliation, including Late
Archaic, Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric.
8.4.3

Taphonomy

The bones were examined for signs of breakage (spiral and green breaks versus dry breaks) and
weathering. A total of 85 bones (1.01 percent) are complete and unbroken. The degree of
weathering to which a bone had been subjected was recorded for each specimen. The degree of
weathering was recorded following Lymanâs (1994) synthesis of Behrensmeyer (1978), Andrews
(1990), and Johnson (1985). The weathering scale consists of rankings from 0 to 5 where 0 equals a
bone with some flesh still attached and 5 is a bone with large splinters which is disintegrating.
Mercado Site (41TR203)

260

July 2019

Typically, all archeological material is minimally assigned a 2 or 3 ranking. Bone assigned a
ranking of 5 has likely been exposed to the sun and weathering for a prolonged time prior to burial,
whereas bones with a ranking of 2 or 3 have been buried shortly after or at the time of their discard.
Most (n = 6,956, 82.9 percent) of the bone recovered from site 41TR203 is assigned a ranking of 3.
Of the remaining, only three specimens (< 0.1 percent) are assigned a ranking of 2, 1,196
specimens (14.2 percent) a ranking of 4, and one bone (< 0.1 percent) a ranking of 5. A few bones
are between weathering classifications, so 143 bones (1.4 percent) are assigned a rank between 3
and 4 and 70 bones (0.8 percent) are assigned a rank between 4 and 5. Twenty-four specimens (0.3
percent) are not assigned a ranking due to burning which obscured the degree of weathering,
oversight, and indeterminate classifications. The higher degree of bones with a rank of 3 indicate
these specimens spent only minimal time on the surface before being buried which is consistent
with floodplain deposits. Additionally, while all but 83 of the specimens exhibit a break of some
kind, the fragments are generally larger and more identifiable as is evidenced by the low ratio of
specimens assigned as indeterminate vertebrate.
8.4.4

Skeletal Part Frequencies

Skeletal part frequencies can be used to infer butchering, transport, food preparation, disposal
habits, nutritional analysis, activity areas, site function, economic institutions, and social
organization (Reitz and Wing 1999). Researchers (Read 1971; Styles 1981) have proposed that
bones of large animals may not be transported from the kill site to the habitation site and the
likelihood of differential conveyance increases with the animalsâ distance from the habitation site.
White (1952) posited that not all parts of a large animal, such as bison, would have been brought
back to camp. He stated that âsince the lower limb does not carry any usable meat it is conceivable
that it was chopped off and left at the place of kill to reduce the loadâ (White 1953: 162). The
process of returning only the higher, meat-yielding elements to the site after a kill is sometimes
referred to as âschlepping.â
Skeletal part frequency analysis is useful in not only determining potential site function (kill site
versus habitation site) but can provide additional insight. Skeletal part frequencies can help
researchers infer taphonomic conditions, for instance when less dense bones such as vertebrae may
be present in lower frequency than dense bone such as long bone fragments. They provide
information about the archeological siteâs ecological surroundings. If there are different frequencies

Mercado Site (41TR203)

261

July 2019

of high versus low meat utility bones for similar sized species but which inhabit different habitats,
the case may be made that one of those species is being locally obtained while the other may be
coming from a greater distance. Skeletal part frequencies can also aid in understanding the
relationship between human subsistence strategies and dietary stress. For example, the presence of
primarily high meat value elements at a site suggests the abundance of game animals (i.e., non-food
stress), whereas the presence of highly processed lower meat value elements suggests food stress.
As bison and deer are the most prevalent typical prey species, an examination of their skeletal part
frequencies was conducted. Pronghorn, while similar in size to deer, are only minimally
represented (n = 7) in the assemblage and are represented by no more than one animal (MNI = 1).
Given the absence of a robust sample, pronghorn are not included in the analysis as any discussion
would be lacking in relevance.
The following analysis uses bovid and cervid NISP to illustrate trends in skeletal part frequencies
(Figure 8.1). The NISP is used since its method of calculation is consistent throughout the entire
site assemblage and consists of larger values that are more suitable for illustrating trends. One
drawback in using NISP is that the occurrence of specific elements is over-represented due to
breakage that may result in multiple counting of the same element. However, since NISP values are
consistently applied throughout the entire assemblage, they are deemed appropriate given the low
MNI values, which do not lend themselves to generating indices and exhibiting trends. In addition,
MNI values are not calculated for unidentified bovid and cervid specimens but rather at the lower
taxonomic levels only (e.g., genus, species) which reduces the frequency of occurrence of these
taxa in other archeological contexts in which they may be present.

There is greater skewing for the frequency of the lowest meat utility elements (skull and phalanges)
in cervids than bovids, although both depict a higher frequency of those elements than higher meat
utility elements. One explanation for this skewing may be that pronghorn were also present at the
site, and many elements including ribs, vertebrae, and long bone fragments would be more difficult
to distinguish between deer and pronghorn when fragmented. Therefore, all medium-large
artiodactyl bones including deer, pronghorn, and those specimens unassignable to genus were
analyzed and results are presented in Figure 8.2. For this figure, all vertebrae were grouped to also
include those unassignable to cervical, thoracic, lumbar, or caudal. There is still a much greater
skewing toward lower utility medium-large artiodactyl bones present at the site indicating difficulty
in identifying to species some elements that are morphologically similar to animals of the same size
was not a good explanation. Given that within the species relative density of most bones of
artiodactyls are similar (e.g., metapodials denser than vertebrae), if procured and processed in the
same manner, skeletal part frequencies should be more similar. Therefore, something beyond
taphonomic processes is responsible for the differences in skeletal part frequencies between bovids
and cervids.
8.4.4.1

Deer

Given mule deer is represented by a single specimen (n = 1), variations between cervid species
cannot be examined with confidence to determine if there were differences between mule deer and
white-tailed deer. Conflating all deer could be problematic, because while the two species have
been known to ecologically overlap and even hybridize, their preferred habitats are different.
Differences in skeletal part frequencies between the two species could influence the numbers due to
differences in hunting strategies or local availability of the two species.
Given that the majority of the identified bone assignable to species, however, was white-tailed deer
(n = 13), it is assumed the majority of the unassignable specimens represent white-tailed deer. For
discussion purposes, all mule deer, white-tailed deer, and Odocoileus sp. specimens are grouped
together for a discussion with regards to skeletal part frequencies. To better interpret the data, meat
utility rankings for white-tailed deer (Jacobson 2000) are used to determine the number of
Odocoileus element groupings for high, middle, and low meat utility ranking (Figure 8.3). Deer
bones from site 41TR203 were broken down by utility ranking and plotted to compare their skeletal

Mercado Site (41TR203)

264

July 2019

part frequencies to the frequencies of elements with the same utility rankings in one animal (Figure
8.4).
Upon examination, deer are unrepresented by any high and middle meat utility parts and are
heavily over-represented by low meat utility parts relative to the average distribution. Despite the
fact that lower utility bones also tend to have higher density, this substantial difference suggests
that the site could have been used for initial processing with low meat utility parts discarded post
processing. Low meat-bearing but high marrow yield elements, such as the metapodials, display
evidence for marrow processing (spiral fractures and platform impacts/percussion point fractures),
suggesting that marrow was removed from the bones during initial processing and the bones
discarded. Given the rate at which deer catabolize fat stores from their long bones, metapodials
would retain fat stores long after most other long bones are depleted. In contrast, there was no
evidence for intentional breakage on the phalanges.

8.4.4.2

Bison

Skeletal part frequencies and standardized gross utility rankings for bison were also examined.
Emersonâs (1990) averaged total products model was used to separate bison elements into high,
middle, and low utility categories. Elements with a unit value greater than 70 (e.g., ribs, thoracic
vertebrae, and lumbar vertebrae) are considered high meat utility. Elements with a unit value
between 30 and 70 (e.g., cervical vertebrae, sternum, sacrum/pelvis, femur, and scapula) are
considered middle meat utility. Any elements with a unit value less than 30 (e.g., humerus, cranial,
tibia, radius/ulna, metacarpal, metatarsal, caudal vertebrae, tarsals, phalanges, and carpals) are
considered low meat utility. While classified as low, humeri and tibia are right on the cusp of
middle meat utility elements. Most identifications were left broad as bovidae if not assignable to
bison based on morphological characteristics, but due to the age of deposits, it is assumed most, if
not all, of the bone is actually bison. Due to this, the general distribution of elements for bison
within Emersonâs (1990) bison rankings are depicted in Figure 8.5.
As can be noted in Figure 8.6, there is a similar pattern of over-representation of low utility parts as
with deer, but not to the same pronounced degree. In addition, there were fewer middle meat utility
parts present relative to both high and low meat utility parts as there are in the standard distribution.
While most of the high and middle meat utility elements (e.g., ribs, thoracic vertebrae, lumbar
vertebrae, cervical vertebrae, sternum, pelvis, scapula) are less dense (Lyman 1994) and, therefore,
more subject to taphonomic processes, one of the middle meat utility elements (i.e., femur) is much
more dense and likely to be preserved. While there were significantly more femur fragments (n =
8) than less dense vertebrae (i.e., thoracic vertebrae n = 2), there are a higher number of scapula (n
= 12) and rib (n = 19) fragments. It is possible other taphonomic factors beyond soil acidity and
erosion may be the cause of the bone fracturing.
Given that bovids are heavier and more robust than deer, it is also likely a higher degree of bone
discard at a processing site would be necessary to allow for transport, or schlepping, higher
meat-yielding elements back to the habitation site (Perkins and Daly 1968; Reitz and Wing 1990).
Meat might be stripped from heavy bones such as femurs and the heavier bones discarded.
Furthermore, when processing the front limb, the easy disarticulation point is at the blade of the
scapula, so removal of it and stripping of associated meat would be an efficient method in
butchering. Many of the bison long bones also exhibit evidence (i.e., spiral fracture and percussion

points) for marrow processing, but no discernible evidence of grease processing. Removal of fatty
marrow for carrying would be lighter and more expedient than hauling the heavier bones.
Canid bones and evidence of carnivore gnawing and breakage of bone at the site are present. Canid
gnawing of spongy bone can be destructive. In general, though, given the preservation of other
fragile bone, such as artiodactyl neonate bone, the high presence of trabecular bone, and even many
trabecular fragments without associated cortical exterior in the assemblage, other factors beyond
taphonomy are likely responsible.
Of interest is that bovid cranial specimens were identified in the assemblage, but no bovid cervical
vertebral fragments were recovered. Cervical vertebrae articulate with the skull, and it would be
anticipated to find them in association with the skull. The complete absence of cervical vertebrae
suggests removal from the site in whole or, more likely, the schlepping of high meat-yielding
elements back to the site, leaving less meat-value elements at the original kill site (Perkins and
Daly 1968; Reitz and Wing 1990).

Fragmentation

The types and amount of fragmentation of bones were examined and recorded (Table 8.3).
Extensive fragmentation of larger bones is typically indicative of heavy processing for marrow and
bone grease. Smashing of long bones of medium mammals and larger was common amongst most
Great Plains groups for the extraction of marrow and bone grease (Kehoe and Kehoe 1960; White
1953, 1954, 1955). General observations during analysis were that some long bones, those with
higher utility based on marrow content had been fractured, but the bone does not appear to have
been smashed for bone grease extraction. In addition, while most of the long bones such as femurs,
humeri, tibias, radii, and metapodials have been broken for marrow, phalanges had not been
intentionally broken.

Approximately 8 percent of the specimens in the assemblage exhibit spiral and green breaks. Of the
627 bones with spiral fractures, 506 specimens belong to medium-size or larger mammals
including indeterminate mammals, artiodactyls, pronghorn, deer, and bovids. The remaining 121
specimens with spiral fractures include rabbit (n = 3), indeterminate size mammal (n = 105), and
indeterminate vertebrate bone (n = 13). Of the 627 bones exhibiting spiral fractures, 336 could not
be identified to element. Of the remaining 291 spiral fractured bones, the majority (n = 264, 91
percent) exhibiting spiral fractures are long bones. Among them, however, are only four phalanges,
despite being the dominant bone present for both deer and bovids that exhibited spiral fractures.
A separate designation of green fractures was recorded, as not all fresh breaks result in spiral
fractures. Green break could be caused by splitting ribs or other bones, smaller animal long bones
being broken, also some carnivore fracturing results in green breaks. While the majority of
Mercado Site (41TR203)

270

July 2019

specimens with green breaks belonged to medium-size or larger mammals, including indeterminate
mammal, artiodactyls, pronghorn, deer, and bovids (n = 30), rodent (n = 2), leporid (n = 9),
indeterminate-size mammal (n = 5), waterfowl (n = 1), and indeterminate vertebrate (n = 1) also
had signs of green breaks. The overall low frequency of intentional breakage and percentage of
unbroken bones indicate that dietary stress was not severe as the specimens do not appear to have
been highly processed for bone grease.
Given the presence of striking platforms/percussion points on some of the bones, the location of
spiral breaks, the intactness of many epiphyseal ends, and the general large nature of even midshaft
fragments, there is clear evidence for marrow processing of bison and deer from the site. However,
there is little to minimal indication for bone grease manufacturing. Based on skeletal part frequency
analysis above, elements âabsentâ or with only minimal presence are those with higher meat utility.
It should be taken into consideration if their absence could be due to high fragmentation as a result
of bone grease processing which would have obscured identification of the element. However,
these elements are not the ones most likely to contain high quality marrow and grease deposits.
Deer and bison tend to catabolize fat from long bones in a specific order. Deer catabolize their fat
stores, the femur, humerus, tibia, and radius marrow fat is mobilized at similar rates with the upper
limbs just above the lower, but the metapodials are the last reservoir for fat storage and can
maintain high fat levels even when the fat in the femur has dropped below 30 percent. Bison
medullary cavities tend to maintain stable reserves until after most body fat and bone grease from
axial bones have been depleted, with eventual reserves pulled from the proximal-most bones first
(humerus and femur) and progressing to the distal-most bones (metapodials and phalanges) last.
This gives other cause for reliance on the more dependable long bone marrow over the depleted
bone grease reserves for seasonally stressed bison. There is no evidence for more than potential
limited bone grease processing at the site, which is based on a few specimens exhibiting spiral
fractures as discussed in the AU discussions below.
8.4.6

Carnivore and Rodent Modification

Of the 8,346 bones recovered from the site, 58 (0.7 percent) exhibit signs of carnivore or rodent
modification. Thirty-one specimens exhibit evidence of carnivore modification (Photo 8.1). Of the
carnivore modified specimens, two had been gnawed. One of the specimens has been punctured by

Mercado Site (41TR203)

271

July 2019

a canine or carnassial. Twenty-eight specimens exhibit etching, polishing, and worn edges typical
of bones which had been through a carnivoreâs digestive tract.
Rodents had gnawed on 27 of the bones recovered from the site. All the bones had been gnawed by
mice, rats, or voles. None of the bones had been gnawed by squirrels. Research (Klippel and
Synstelien 2007) has shown that brown rats only gnaw bone which is fresh and still laden with fats,
while squirrels only gnaw on thicker bone cortices after their fats have leached away. Rats will
gnaw on bones recently deposited, while squirrels tend to be more likely to gnaw on bone left
exposed for a prolonged period of time. Therefore, most of the gnawing likely occurred near or at
the time of deposition, suggesting at least some commensal rodent presence.
8.4.7

Taphonomy Summary

Despite the fact that most of the bone (n = 7,586, 90.9 percent) exhibits dry (post-depositional) or
indeterminate (unknown whether just post-mortem or post-depositional) breaks, the bone from
site 41TR203 is more identifiable and better preserved than most assemblages in Texas. Given the
minor degree of green/spiral breaks, it is assumed that the identifiability of the assemblage is
directly related to the absence for any evidence of substantial bone grease processing of the
assemblage. The minor presence of advanced weathering combined with the overall preservation of
the bone is also indicative of relatively fast burying of the faunal remains. Despite some evidence
for carnivore and rodent gnawing, there is only a minor degree of scavenging on remains after
butchering. This would also indicate fairly rapid burying of the material during or just postdeposition. Lastly, taphonomy alone cannot be responsible for skeletal part frequency differential
distributions of the major prey species at the site. There is some evidence for initial processing of
remains at the site and some selective transport of elements to the site from the original kill site
which was likely some distance away from the habitation site.

Cultural Modification

The bone was examined for evidence of cultural modification, including cut, chop, and saw marks,
other signs of processing such as a striking platform for bone breakage and marrow extraction
(Figure 8.2), or any form of thermal alteration. Bone was also examined for modification into or
use as a bone tool. In addition, as other evidence for expedient bone tool use has been noted at
other regional sites with minimal lithic assemblages, the bones were examined for abrading or
other evidence of use wear (Photo 8.3). Of the 8,346 bones recovered from the site, 810
(9.7 percent) had evidence for cultural modification. Of the 810 bones which had been culturally
modified, thermal alteration (n = 692, 84.8 percent) was by far the most common form of
modification.

Thermal Alteration

The color of the burned bones was recorded as an indicator of the degree of thermal alteration.
Brown discoloration is indicative of short-term and lower heat burning, such as exposure to a grass
fire or camp fire for less than 6 minutes (Lyman 1994). Blackened bone has been carbonized and
would indicate prolonged exposure to a grass fire or camp fire. Gray and white bone has been fully
calcined, which means that it has lost all organic matter and become plastically deformed. Thermal
alteration was by far the most prevalent modification on the bone (n = 692, 84.8 percent of
culturally modified bone, 8.3 percent of all bone in the assemblage). Of the 692 bones with thermal
alteration, 205 exhibit brown discoloration, 304 are blackened, 159 are fully calcined, and 24 have
turned gray from heating.
Thermal alteration includes both direct burning of the bone which was exposed to fire and indirect
modification of the bone from another heat source. It was noted during analysis that numerous long
bones, a mandible, and rarely, a rib had a localized brown spot on the bone varying in size but
approximately 2 to 3 cm long by 2 to 3 cm wide. Within the browning were microfractures on the
bone radiating out, indicating quick contact with extreme heat (rather than being held over a flame
and slowly increasing in heat to the bone). The localized browning was near or adjacent to a
spiral/green break, typically at the breakage point along a long bone for marrow extraction. Similar
brown marks have been described elsewhere in the literature). They have been assumed to be
Mercado Site (41TR203)

275

July 2019

associated with heating of the bone for marrow extraction. A suggestion has been that these marks
are instead the result of application of a heated rock to the bone, in essence searing the bone and
weakening it, such that striking it would cause it to break with less effort. There is evidence from
site 41TR203 for burned rock features. The rock could have been heated for placing the meat on
the rocks and heating palettes. As heating of poor lithic raw material is well-known to make
breakage more predictable and less labor-intensive (Domanski and Webb 1992), it is possible
similar techniques were applied to bone for marrow extraction.
Since the fragments of small lizard (cut), very small colubrid snake (thermal alteration), small aves
(thermal alteration), pocket gopher (cut), marsh rice rat (thermal alteration), cotton rat (thermal
alteration), and a microtine mouse/vole (thermal alteration) exhibit evidence of cultural
modification, it is suggestive that these species may have been subject to human consumption.
8.4.10

Analytical Units

Most of the bone recovered from site 41TR203 was recovered from well-stratified deposits with
associated C-14 dates. Of the 8,346 total bones recovered from the site, 8,067 (97 percent) are from
well-defined stratigraphic levels that are grouped into three temporal/cultural periods, including
Late Archaic, Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric. The remaining 279 bones are either
located between levels or could only be assigned to rough approximations of levels.
Temporal associations of each analytical unit (AU) were determined by radiometric dating
(Table 8.5). Dates for those units have been compiled, and the oldest occupation is discussed first.
Given the good stratigraphic control and good preservation of bone, it was possible to examine
shifts in species presence at the site over time and determine changes in both subsistence strategies
and environment (Table 8.5).

Analytical Unit 8 (2645-2430 yr Cal BP)

AU 8 is the oldest context associated with cultural material recovered from site 41TR203.
Stratigraphically, it is beneath AU 7 at the base of Strat Zone III. A total of 2,261 vertebrate
remains were recovered from AU 8, accounting for greater than 27.1 percent of the entire
vertebrate assemblage at the site. Table 8.6 summarizes the NISP and MNIs for each taxon and
general animal size recovered from AU 8. Feature 21.1 has bison associated with it, while Feature
20 has only unidentified large mammal (bison-size), and Feature 24 has a few specimens identified
as jackrabbit and cotton rat. No faunal remains were associated with Feature 42.
Grassland species, such as bison (n = 28), rabbit (n = 20), and pocket gopher (n = 2), dominate the
identifiable bone recovered from AU 8. Cotton rats (n = 4) can inhabit scrub brush or grassland and
most jackrabbits (n = 5), cottontails (n = 5) and other rabbits (n = 10) occupy open and scrub brush
terrain. Odocoileus sp. could represent either mule deer or white-tailed deer. While white-tailed
deer are more diverse in habitats which they can utilize, they must have forest edge/riparian nearby
for foraging. Mule deer (n = 1) prefer shrub brush and chaparral habitats. As it cannot be assigned
to species, and mule deer and white-tailed deer tend to utilize different habitats, overlap of their
presence is considered uninformative. Whereas deer are the dominate mammal in the entire
vertebrate assemblage based on NISP, within AU 8 there are only 10 deer bones contrasted with a
total of 70 bovid bones that are all bison. In addition to grassland species, there is a presence within
AU 8 of aquatic/wetland species such as catfish (n = 1), turtle (n = 1), beaver or beaver/porcupine
(n = 4).
Therefore, based on the species present, it is likely that the environment and habitat associated with
site 41TR203 during the Late Archaic period represented in AU 8 was an open grassland prairie,
potentially grassland floodplains near to a reliable aquatic resource (see Table 8.6). Most of the
Mercado Site (41TR203)

277

July 2019

aquatic species present (beaver, catfish, and turtles) prefer slow-moving water or shallow ponds
with muddy bottoms. It is possible that despite the faster-moving waterway of the West Fork of the
Trinity River located there today, the aquatic resources may have come from an oxbow, slough, or
slow meander associated with the West Fork of the Trinity River that is no longer present. Figure
8.7 illustrates the frequencies of grassland/prairie, chaparral, and woodland species. Figure 8.8
illustrates the frequencies of aquatic versus terrestrial taxa.
8.4.11.1

Seasonality Data

Given the presence of reptiles (i.e., turtles and snakes) in the assemblage, there is evidence for
warmer weather occupation of the site, as turtles typically hibernate when temperatures drop below
45Â°F. Based on historic and modern daily averages, the average daily temperatures in the Dallas
area are above 45Â°F from March through November. Reptiles are the only indicator of seasonality
within AU 8.

Skeletal Part Frequencies

Skeletal part frequency analysis for deer (Figure 8.9) depicts a similar degree of high, middle, and
low utility elements. While sample size is only 10, elements present in AU 8 represent either
nearby or onsite kill and consumption. These elements include ribs, cervical vertebrae, metatarsals,
lateral malleolus, a temporal bone fragment, and a lower incisor. What is interesting is a contrast
illustrated in Figure 8.10 for white-tailed deer with the analysis for the entire site discussed above
where low utility parts dominated. That is not the case with AU 8.
Skeletal part frequency of the 70 bovid bones associated with AU 8; however, indicate a slightly
higher degree of low utility elements than expected and a few less middle utility elements. It is
assumed, due to the deposits having been dated to 2645 to 2430 yr Cal BP, that all bovid bone
within AU 8 is bison. Bones included in the frequency analysis below include ribs, femur, patella,
scapula, humeri, radii, tibia, metacarpals, various tarsals and carpals, lateral malleolus, phalanges,
and teeth. There were some vertebral fragments, but unassignable to cervical, thoracic, lumbar, or
caudal. There is evidence for carnivore modification on 18 specimens, and both innominates and
vertebrae with their high porosity could have been easily consumed. Overall, it appears both meat
processing and consumption was occurring at the site within the AU 8 Late Archaic period
occupation of the site.
8.4.11.3

Cultural Modification

Both deer and bovid skeletal part frequencies are consistent with some onsite processing and
consumption. In addition, modified bone from AU 8 consists of 17 specimens with cut marks
(26.6 percent of the 64 total cut marks recorded at the site), 3 specimens with chop marks
(100 percent of the three total chop marks recorded at the site), 2 specimens with percussion
points/striking platforms (33.3 percent of the six total percussion/striking marks recorded at the
site), 1 abraded expedient bone tool (33.3 percent of the total for this category recorded at the site),
and 117 burned specimens (16.9% of all burned bone at the site). The modification numbers
suggest onsite butchering, and the burning is consistent with cooking and subsistence activities.
8.4.11.4

Breakage

Of the 2,261 total bones recovered from AU 8, 23 are unbroken, 2,150 have only evidence of dry
breakage, 83 exhibit spiral fractures, three have evidence for other green bone fresh fractures, and
Mercado Site (41TR203)

281

four have indeterminate breaks. As spiral and green breaks are evidence for cultural processing, a
review of bones was undertaken to analyze which bones were being intentionally broken. Forty-six
unidentified specimens exhibit spiral fractures. Of the specimens with spiral breaks identifiable to
element, or at least to a broad category such as âlong bone,â 35 of the 37 specimens are long bones
including undefined long bone (n = 27), humeri (n = 4), radius/ulna (n = 3), and tibia (n = 1). The
remaining two specimens that exhibit spiral fractures include a second phalanx. In addition,
non-spiral green break fractures are also present on two long bone fragments and a temporal cranial
bone. Therefore, all the intentional fragmentation is consistent with marrow removal or breakage of
the skull to access the brain for consumption.

Weathering

Bone from AU 8 was assessed for its degree of weathering. Bone with a ranking of 3 (n = 1,865)
was most prevalent, although there are 357 fragments with a ranking of 4, and 41 fragments with
an intermediary ranking of 3 to 4. In general, weathering indicates most of the bone was buried
immediately after its disposal, but given the 357 bones with a ranking of 4, at least some were
exposed to weathering prior to burial.
8.4.12

Analytical Unit 7 (2260-2210 yr Cal BP)

AU 7 was initially analyzed as a series of occupations that span a period of 500 years and is
stratigraphically within Strat Zone III. Most of the bone within AU 7 was recovered from a sheet
midden, potentially formed from cleaning of a few notable earth oven features also located within
AU 7. A total of 4,474 vertebrate remains were identified in AU 7, which accounts for more than
half (52.3 percent) of the total vertebrate assemblage recovered from the site. In addition, the
assemblage from AU 7 accounts for more than half of the total mammalian assemblage (n = 3,584,
51.2 percent), the majority of the avian assemblage (n = 16, 88.9 percent) including all but one of
the waterfowl from the site total assemblage, the majority of the reptile assemblage (n = 66,
90.4 percent) including all but one of the turtle remains from the site, and the only unassignable
herptile bone (n = 1). Table 8.7 summarizes the NISP and MNIs for each taxon and specimen
recovered from AU 7. Only a few specimens identified to a taxon were recovered from features.
Bison is associated with Features 32, 34, and 41, and snake and leporids are associated with
Feature 33. No faunal remains are associated with Features 6, 35, 36, 38, 40, and 43.

The fauna from AU 7 is the most diverse of any of the AUs and includes grassland, mixed scrub
brush and grassland, scrub brush, riparian, and wetland/aquatic species. Grassland and prairie
species dominate. Bison (n = 15) and bovids (n = 57) assumed to be bison due to the age of
deposits associated with AU 7 is nearly equal to the NISP in AU 7, but most of the pronghorn (n =
5) and the only identified mule deer (n = 1) are also within AU 7. Both bison and pronghorn are
grassland species, although mule deer tend to occupy more scrub brush settings and other open
settings. Other grassland species were present, such as pocket gopher (n = 3) and hispid cotton rat,
which prefers tall grass (n = 3). There is a moderate presence of species preferring both grassland
and scrub brush including a harvest mouse (n = 1), ground squirrel (n = 2), coyote/dog (n = 6), and
those preferring brushy/chaparral or edge open environments including the one mule deer (n = 1),
cottontail (n = 25), jackrabbit (n = 3), and other leporid rabbit (n = 19). The primary
riparian/woodland species present is white-tailed deer (n = 5), though the one fox bone could
belong to either a gray fox, which prefers woodland, or a kit fox, which prefers grasslands and
deserts.
In addition, there are a moderate amount of vertebrate species that prefer aquatic environments,
including beaver (n = 6), indeterminate beaver or porcupine (n = 1), Canada goose (n = 1), ducks
and small geese (n = 2), indeterminate waterfowl (n = 1), box turtle (n = 2), red eared slider (n =
41), other sliders/cooters (n = 1), pond turtle (n = 3), and other indeterminate turtle (n = 17).
Environmental preferences of the identified species are illustrated in Figure 8.11. The presence of
diverse species across these habitats is indicative of an early stage successional environment with
some grassland transitioning to scrub brush/chaparral and riparian habitat available along the river.
This ties in well with noted shifts in C-4 to C-3 plants which peak during and then drop with the
temporal termination of AU 7.
Most of the aquatic species utilize slower moving, pond-like habitats (e.g., ducks, turtles, and
beaver), so it is likely there was a nearby oxbow, slough, or other relict channel associated with the
West Fork of the Trinity River during this Late Archaic period utilization of the site. There is a
much higher degree of vertebrate aquatic species present than in the later AUs (AUs 1 through 6),
however, given the shell midden associated with AU 6, there may have been a shift in the type of
aquatic resource utilization from vertebrate to invertebrate taxa. The mollusk shell is discussed
elsewhere (see Chapter 10). A comparison of terrestrial to aquatic taxa represented in AU 7 is
illustrated in Figure 8.12.

Seasonality Data

Given the presence of reptiles (especially turtles) in the AU 7 assemblage, there is evidence for
warm weather occupation, as turtles typically hibernate when temperatures drop below 45Â°F (Roots
2006). Based on historic and modern daily averages (NOAA 2013), the average daily temperatures
in the Dallas area are above 45Â°F from March through November. Geese could also indicate
warmer temperatures, but some geese winter in the Dallas area so their presence is not definitive.
Another seasonal indicator is the presence of geese and ducks recovered from AU 7. In Texas,
however, the presence of migrating waterfowl is not typically conclusive as there are species of
ducks that are resident year-round in the state. One exception to this, the presence of Canada geese
(Branta canadensis), would suggest a winter use of the site between October and March, although
there are some geese that linger longer in Texas.
There were no juvenile or neonate artiodactyls in the assemblage associated with AU 7, and while
there was antler, none of it was in velvet. Since deer drop their antlers annually, there is potential
for them to have been picked up or associated with any season of the year. Given the above, it is
probable that AU 7 was occupied multiple times given both warm and winter seasonal indicators.
This is consistent with other artifact analyses associated with AU 7 that suggest multiple
occupations over a 500-year time span.
8.4.12.2

Skeletal Part Frequencies

When skeletal part frequencies from bovids and deer are examined from AU 7, interesting trends
are noted. There were only five white-tailed deer bone clearly assignable to a utility category (four
low utility and one middle utility) and only one mule deer bone (middle utility) in the AU 7
assemblage. Presence of both could represent different subsistence strategies, yet due to low
sample sizes, all deer including white-tailed deer, mule deer, and unassignable Odocoileus sp. were
grouped together. The deer bone was pooled in order to examine skeletal part frequencies. Results
are similar to those when the full site assemblage was assessed with a much higher than anticipated
presence of low utility elements (Figure 8.13). This would support use of the site during this
timeframe for initial animal processing with at least some of the higher utility elements being
transported to the site from kill sites located some distance away (i.e., schlepping the high meat
value elements back to the habitation site).

Mercado Site (41TR203)

288

July 2019

Bison and bovid bone present, however, indicate a similar trend as the deer with a much higher
than anticipated presence of low utility bones (Figure 8.14). Therefore, it is likely that the site
would represent a kill and initial processing location with some transport of middle and high utility
bones to the site from other kill sites located some distance away.

Modification

There were only minimal cut marks present on bones from AU 7 (n = 12), no chop marks, and only
three specimens with percussion points/impact platforms associated with marrow processing. This
represents only 0.3 percent of the AU 7 assemblage and is surprising given the presence of earth
oven features within this occupation level. However, 412 bones, or 9.4 percent of the AU 7
assemblage, exhibits signs of burning which would be consistent with cooking in earth ovens and
later disposal.
8.4.12.4

Breakage

Of the total 4,474 bones from AU 7, 33 specimens are unbroken, 4,048 exhibit dry breaks, 216
exhibit spiral breaks, 15 exhibit non-spiral green breaks, and 126 have indeterminate breaks. As
spiral and green breaks are evidence for cultural processing, a review of bones was undertaken to
analyze which bones were being intentionally broken. A total of 109 bones of undetermined
element exhibit spiral fractures, of which 100 were long bones including undefined long bone (n =
89), radius/ulna (n = 4), femur (n = 3), tibia (n = 3), and metatarsal (n = 1). The remaining
specimens with a spiral fracture included one scapula and six rib fragments. In addition, non-spiral
green break fractures were also present on one humerus, two radii, one tibia, one tarsometatarsus,
eight long bone fragments, and one unknown specimen. Therefore, the majority of intentional
fragmentation is consistent with marrow removal. Some bone grease processing is possible given
the fragmentation on ribs and scapula, although the spiral fragmentation could have occurred
during other butchering or expedient bone tool production.
8.4.12.5

Weathering

The bone from AU 7 was assessed for its degree of weathering. Bone with a ranking of 3 (n =
3,553) was most prevalent. There are 690 specimens with a ranking of 4, 75 with an intermittent
ranking of 3 to 4, 69 with an intermittent ranking of 4 to 5, 1 with a ranking of 5, and 1 with an
indeterminate ranking. Given the high occurrence of 3 and 4 rankings it is likely that most of the
bone was left exposed to weathering for a short, not prolonged, period prior to burial. Some of the
bone, however, was exposed to weathering for a substantial time given the 4 to 5 and 5 rankings.
Given the presence of most of the bone in a sheet midden, some of the bones dumped on top could
have been left unexposed during unoccupied times.

Analytical Unit 6 (2000 yr Cal BP)

AU 6 is associated with the top of Strat Zone III and may be associated with a dense shell midden.
A total of 67 vertebrate remains were identified in AU 6, accounting for only 0.8 percent of the
total vertebrate assemblage from the site. Only a few specimens were recovered from Feature 30,
and none were recovered from Feature 19. The fauna from AU 6 is not very diverse, as it only
contains mammals and vertebrates. The identifiable mammal species are limited to bison (n = 3),
large artiodactyl (n = 2), cottontail (n = 1), and other rabbit (n = 1). Table 8.8 summarizes the NISP
and MNIs for each species and specimen recovered from AU 6.

Given the small sample size, little specific analysis is possible for AU 6. There is no presence of
deer or any medium-large artiodactyls. Bison consists wholly of three teeth fragments, with large
artiodactyl consisting of a sesmoid and possible astragalus fragment. Only seven specimens were
culturally modified, all of which are burned. One large mammal bone had an odd groove on the
external surface which could be incised, but no additional information is available.
Obviously, there were some open grassland or edge environments due to the presence of bison and
cottontail, but given the paucity of identified vertebrate remains, no environmental information can
be stated with confidence based on the vertebrate fauna.
8.4.13.1

Weathering

All bone from AU 6 was assessed for their degree of weathering, of which all 67 specimens
exhibited a fragmentation ranking of 3, suggesting minimal or no exposure prior to being buried.

Analytical Unit 5 (1815-1470 yr Cal BP)

AU 5 corresponds to Strat Zone II. A total of 54 vertebrate remains were recovered from AU 5
which account for only 0.6 percent of the total vertebrate assemblage from the site. The fauna from
AU 5 is not very diverse but includes mammals, reptiles, and vertebrates, and identifiable species
are limited to pronghorn (n = 1), indeterminate deer (n = 1), medium-large artiodactyl (n = 4),
cottontail (n = 1), a slider/cooter turtle (n = 1), and snake (n = 1). Notably absent are bison, bovid,
large artiodactyl, and large mammal remains. The presence of pronghorn suggests at least some
lingering grassland presence, but not enough or of the quality to support bison, as it is assumed
bison would be a preferred prey over pronghorn if present. Also, the only identified pronghorn
specimen was a tooth located in a floodplain with no definitive cultural association. It is possible
the pronghorn represents redeposition instead of a cultural event. Table 8.9 summarizes the NISP
and MNIs for each species and specimen recovered from AU 5.
Given the minimal presence of bone, little specific information can be gleaned from the small
assemblage from AU 5. The only modified bone are four burned fragments. All 54 fragments
exhibit a 3 rank for weathering, so they were buried shortly after their disposal. There are no bones
suggestive of seasonality, with the exception of the turtle which would indicate a warm season
occupation.

Analytical Unit 4 (1710-1560 yr Cal BP)

AU 4 corresponds to Strat Zone II. Part of AU 4 includes a mussel shell midden. There is limited
bone associated with AU 4, with only 29 vertebrate remains identified, which account for only
0.3 percent of the total vertebrate assemblage from the site. Only a few bone specimens were
recovered from Features 25 and 26, and none were recovered from Feature 21. The fauna from
AU 4 is limited to only one identifiable species, coyote/dog (n = 1) with the remainder being only
identifiable to mammal and vertebrate. Notably absent are artiodactyls. Table 8.10 summarizes the
NISP and MNI for each species and specimen recovered from AU 4.
Again, the paucity of vertebrate remains recovered from AU 4 limit the information that can be
gleaned from it. The only modified bone includes two burned specimens. Weathering rankings
include eight specimens with a rank of 3, 17 with a rank of 4, and one with a rank of 4 to 5.
Weather rankings suggest bone was left exposed for some duration prior to burial. There are no
indicators for seasonal use.

13.5 percent of the total vertebrate assemblage from the site. The fauna from AU 3 is lacking in
overall diversity and of bone identifiable beyond class. Deer, including white-tailed deer (n = 8)
and indeterminate deer (n = 77), dominate the assemblage. An additional 55 medium-large
artiodactyls were also recorded. Large Bovidae (bison-size) (n = 5) is represented by a phalanx and
a few rib and vertebra fragments. These large Bovidae remains could not be identified to genus or
species. Therefore, there are no definitive grassland species present. The assemblage consists
predominantly of mixed scrub brush and woodland or wood-edge species (Figure 8.18). Table 8.11
summarizes the NISP and MNIs for each species and specimen recovered from AU 3.
8.4.16.1

Skeletal Part Frequencies

Skeletal part frequencies were assessed for deer. There was a wide disparity in the frequencies in
which low utility bones are present with regard to high and middle utility (Figure 8.16). Low utility
bones consist predominantly of metapodials, phalanges, radius/ulna, carpals, and cranial remains.
Much of the lower utility long bones exhibit evidence of spiral or green fractures which are
consistent with processing for extracting bone marrow.
8.4.16.2

Breakage

Of the total 1,225 specimens in the AU 3 assemblage, 21 are unbroken, 815 exhibit dry breaks, 261
exhibit spiral breaks, exhibit non-spiral green breaks, and 21 have indeterminate breaks. As spiral
and green breaks are evidence for cultural processing, a review of bones was undertaken to analyze
which bones were being intentionally broken. A total of 170 specimens of undetermined elements
exhibit spiral fractures. Of the specimens with spiral breaks identifiable to element, or at least to a
broad category such as âlong bone,â 83 include undefined long bone (n = 75), metacarpal (n = 5),
tibia (n = 2), and metatarsal (n = 1). The remaining bones with spiral fractures include a first
phalanx (n = 2), cranial fragments (n = 5), and one axial fragment. In addition, non-spiral green
break fractures were also present on a humerus and a metatarsal, two long bone, one cranial, and
three unidentifiable fragments. Therefore, most of the intentional fragmentation is consistent with
marrow extraction or breakage of the cranium to access the brain.

Seasonality

Despite the nearness to the West Fork of the Trinity River, no aquatic species, reptiles, or
migratory birds, being potential seasonal indicators, were identified in the AU 3 assemblage.
Juvenile deer are represented by two unerupted third molars that would have belonged to a fawn
approximately 4 to 5 months of age. Given modern and historic reproductive cycles for white-tailed
deer in the Dallas area (Jacobson 1994), this would suggest seasonal use of site 41TR203 during
late September to November.

Analytical Unit 2 (1530-1200 yr Cal BP)

AU 2 occurred directly beneath the plow zone. The vertebrate assemblage associated with AU 2 is

of the total vertebrate assemblage from the site. The identified fauna from AU 2 is limited to only
one identifiable taxon beyond class, medium-large artiodactyl (n = 1) with the remainder only
identifiable to mammal. Table 8.12 summarizes the NISP and specimens recovered from AU 2.
Given the limited size of the assemblage, only minimal information can be gleaned; however, there
is one potential expedient tool with an abraded edge associated with AU 2. The only other modified
bone has either been gnawed by rodents (n = 2) or burned (n = 2). Weathering rankings include
nine specimens assigned to a rank of 3, but one specimen has a rank of 2. Weather rankings suggest
bone was buried soon after its deposition. There are no identified faunal indicators for seasonal use
of the site.

Table 8.14 summarizes the NISP and MNIs of the vertebrae faunal assemblage (n = 212) from
excavated contexts that are not assigned to any of the eight stratigraphic temporal/cultural AUs
described above. These specimens are primarily derived from trenches and shovel tests that were
not able to provide more accurate depth and geomorphological context. Identified taxa include a
single lizard specimen (Lacertilia), deer (Odocoileus sp.) (n = 15), pronghorn (n = 1), cf. pronghorn

identified taxa are associated with these two features (see Table 8.14). The occurrence of bison,
deer, and pronghorn suggests many of these unassigned specimens are most likely associated with
the Late Archaic component at the Mercado site, or AUs 7 and 8. Because there is no chronological
affiliation or vertical association assigned to these specimens, they do not warrant further

AMS Dating

Ten specimens were selected to submit for AMS dating to supplement the radiometrically dated
charcoal samples culled from the eight AUs (see Table 8.15). Table 8.15 summarizes the
specimens culled for further processing and submittal for AMS dating. The ten specimens were
judgmentally selected based upon the following criteria: 1) identification to the lowest taxonomic
level, preferably species or genus; 2) complete or nearly complete, or an articular end of a long
bone; 3) large enough to produce a reliable AMS date; and 4) as many of the eight AUs were
represented as possible, particularly those grouped according to cultural/temporal affiliation,
including Late Archaic (AUs 6 through 8), Transitional Archaic (AUs 4 and 5), and Late

Summary

Research questions posed prior to analysis included species presence and environmental shifts,
subsistence strategies, taphonomy, and cultural use of bone. The breadth of information presented
thus far will be summarized with respect to these issues.
Specific vertebrate faunal research questions developed for data recovery include:
1. Do the changes in faunal assemblages reflect changes in C3 and C4 ecosystems?
Environmental conditions and species availability within the catchment area of the site altered over
time. The vertebrate faunal assemblages recovered from AUs 1 through 8 provide collaborative
evidence in conjunction with the radiometric dates of paleoenvironmental habitats that were
exploited by the Late Archaic, Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric inhabitants of
site 41TR203. Regarding the radiometric dated geomorphic levels at the site, stable carbon isotopes
reported as Î´13C values provide information on local vegetation. It has been recognized for a long
time that different groups of plants have significantly diverse pathways of photosynthesis, resulting
in a unique chemistry in plant tissues. Most plants are C3 (approximately 95 percent), with C4

accounting for approximately 5 percent. The C3 and C4 pathways produce different Î´13C
signatures. C3 woody plants have Î´13C values that are less than -19percent (more negative), and
C4 grasses have Î´13C values that are more than -19percent (less negative) (OâLeary 1988). Seven
AMS radiocarbon dates of bone collagen from AUs 1 through 8 yielded Î´13C values ranging from
-9.1 to -0.5percent spanning the period 2723 to 956 yr Cal BP (774 B.C. to A.D. 994) (see Table
8.5). Based upon Î´13C values, the earlier Late Archaic components (AUs 7 and 8) had local
vegetation consisting of mixed shrubs/grasses vegetation as evidenced by Î´13C values clustering
around -9.1 to -9.5 and also -20.0 to -20.5 from bison and deer collagen. The Transitional Archaic
period vegetation was likely dominated by grassland with deer collagen yielding a Î´13C value of 20.2. More recently, during the Late Prehistoric, the local vegetation was grassy shrubland as
evidenced by cottontail collagen yielding a Î´13C value of -18.2. The vertebrate faunal assemblages
collaborate these paleoenvironments.
2. Are there a significant number of bison remains?
All the identified bison remains (to genus level) were recovered from the Late Archaic components
comprised by AUs 6 through 8. The total bison and cf. bison NISP (n = 49) is the largest meat
producing identified taxon from this component. Its absence in the assemblages for the Transitional
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods is indicative of its importance in the subsistence of the Late
Archaic period occupants of the site.
3. How does the number of bison compare to other open prairie style species?
The bison NISP (n = 49) compared to other grassland taxa include pronghorn (n = 5) and deer (n =
67) during the Late Archaic period. The presence of bison and pronghorn are indicative of
predominately grassland habitats while the deer supports a grassland and forest ecotone
environment being present nearby to the site during the Late Archaic.
4. Do grassland changes appear to have affected the presence of bison?
There are noted environmental changes represented by the shifting ratios and presence of identified
taxa noted in the AUs where the amount of bone present exceeds 100 specimens, which includes
AUs 3, 7, and 8. AU 8, representing the Late Archaic, is dominated by grassland species such as
bison, but with a shift to a more diverse assemblage during AU 7, which is slightly later during the

Mercado Site (41TR203)

302

July 2019

Late Archaic. There are indicators of nearby prairie with a successional ecotone of scrub brush and
riparian habitats overlapping or adjacent to the site. By the time of AU 3, representing the Late
Prehistoric at 1719 to 1025 yr Cal BP, taxa presence shifted to those species that prefer woodland
and some scrub brush and mixed open habitats.
The occupation of the Mercado site (until 1050 yr Cal BP) ends just prior to the earliest occupation
of a well-preserved nearby site, Fish Creek Slough (41DL436). The earliest occupation at Fish
Creek Slough is dated to 1270 AD, or approximately 800 yr Cal BP. In that earliest occupation at
the site, bison was present, but minimally (n = 2), with an increase in the presence of bison by AD
1405 to 1650 and a decreasing in their presence after A.D. 1650. The two well-preserved, nearby
sites can give a fairly holistic picture of bison presence and shifting grassland availability from
2645 yr Cal BP to the nineteenth century.
The faunal evidence suggests a shift or transition from predominately a grassland habitat to a
mixed grassland and forest or ecotone habitat during the end of the Late Archaic into the
Transitional Archaic periods. This change from predominately grassland to mixed grassland and
forest appears to have affected the presence of bison and a shift in the subsistence economy as
represented by the later (Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric) cultural components.
5. Do any specimens exhibit cut marks?
Cut marks, minimal chops, and breakage of bone with a hammerstone (percussion points) were
evident and browning at some break points may have indicated localized heating of bone with hot
rocks to make breakage of the bone easier. Spiral fractures were predominantly noted on long
bones consistent with breakage for the extraction of marrow. There was no pattern suggesting an
increase or decrease in marrow extraction over time, and there is no direct evidence for processing
bone to extract grease at the site.
6. Do cut marks or other data indicate that the animals were butchered on site or were brought
to the site from elsewhere?
Skeletal part frequencies for AU 8, Late Archaic, indicate nearby kill and onsite consumption, but
skeletal part frequency analysis for both bison and deer for AU 7, Late Archaic, and for deer for
AU 3, Late Prehistoric, would indicate that while the animal was killed near the site, and some

Mercado Site (41TR203)

303

July 2019

initial processing for meat removal and marrow extraction occurred at the site. Elements with high
and middle meat utility may have been transported to the site from other kill loci through
schlepping.
7. Do the various species reflect a broad-spectrum diet?
The diverse faunal assemblage recovered from the Late Archaic (AUs 6 through 8) component
suggests a broad-spectrum subsistence strategy. However, the paucity of fish, amphibians, reptiles,
and birds suggests these taxa are likely intrusive to the cultural deposits or were acquired
opportunistically if readily available by the siteâs occupants. In contrast, the larger game that
includes bison, deer, and pronghorn appear to reflect a focal hunting strategy of large game, with
hunting forays on short trips to surrounding areas and the kill sites being elsewhere. The presence
of most of the siteâs lagomorph (n = 39) remains, also from the Late Archaic component, suggests
these smaller game animals were probably acquired opportunistically.
8. Do the vertebrate faunal remains reflect a specialized use of the site?
The vertebrate faunal assemblage from the Mercado site strongly suggests the site was used as a
semi-permanent seasonal camp by its prehistoric occupants, spanning the Late Archaic,
Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. The Late Archaic component, represented by
AUs 6 through 8, represents a base camp where bison, deer, and pronghorn were killed elsewhere,
and the high-meat yielding elements were returned to the site for further processing for
consumption. The Transitional Archaic occupation, represented by AUs 4 and 5, is characterized
by shell middens (see Chapter 8). The vertebrate faunal assemblage is indicative of a focal
subsistence centered on the harvesting and processing of mollusks from the West Fork of the
Trinity River. The Late Prehistoric component, represented by AUs 1 through 3, has a limited
variety of taxa with an emphasis upon deer (n = 86). The deer specimens are indicative of hunting
forays into the nearby deciduous forests and schlepping the higher meat-yielding bones back to the
Mercado site for further processing for consumption.
9. Does the assemblage suggest seasonal occupation of the site? If so, do the AUs reflect
changes in seasonality?

Mercado Site (41TR203)

304

July 2019

The occurrence of amphibians and reptiles in the Late Archaic assemblage, AUs 6 through 8, is
indicative of spring through fall use of the site when these taxa would have been active. There is no
direct evidence of a winter or cold weather occupation of the site. Indirect evidence of a fall
occupation is illustrated by the dominance of bison, deer, and pronghorn. Traditionally, among
Plains Tribes, fall hunting forays were pursued prior to the winter months, when the large game
animals were most fit with regards to their meat value and condition of their hides for making
clothing and shelters. Consequently, an apparent focus on hunting large game animals indirectly
supports a fall occupation of the site.
10. Do the concentrations of faunal remains reflect different processing activities?
The vertebrate faunal remains do not reflect different processing activities. A large part of the
assemblage is fragmented as a result of probable processing of bone marrow. The fragmentation of
predominately the long bones appears to have occurred during both the Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric occupations of the site. The paucity of vertebrate faunal remains from the Transitional
Archaic period occupation of the site does not permit reflecting upon this, since the component is
dominated by shell middens.
11. Is there evidence of bone grease processing?
The types and amount of fragmentation of bones were examined and recorded. Extensive
fragmentation of larger bones is typically indicative of heavy processing for marrow and bone
grease. Smashing of long bones of medium mammals and larger was common amongst most Great
Plains groups for the extraction of marrow and bone grease (Kehoe and Kehoe 1960; White 1953,
1954, 1955). General observations during analysis were that for bison, deer, and pronghorn, some
long bones with higher utility based on marrow content had been fractured, but the bone does not
appear to have been smashed for bone grease extraction. In addition, while most of the long bones
such as femurs, humeri, tibias, radii, and metapodials have been broken for marrow, phalanges had
not been intentionally broken.
12. Were any of the rock features used for boiling bones to produce bone grease?
Some of the rock features may have been used to prepare bone grease; however, general
observations during analysis were that for bison, deer, and pronghorn, some long bones with higher

Mercado Site (41TR203)

305

July 2019

utility based on marrow content had been fractured, but the bone does not appear to have been
smashed for bone grease extraction.
13. Was the site near the kill sites of the animals and used as an initial processing site, or does
the evidence suggest a post-processing site? Does this differ between AUs?
The general absence or paucity of low-meat yielding elements of bison, deer, and pronghorn
suggests the kill sites were likely near the Mercado site, and the highest meat-yielding bones were
returned, or schlepped, back to the site for further preparation for consumption. There does not
appear to be any difference in the processing of the larger game animals between the Late Archaic
(AUs 6 through 8) and the Late Prehistoric (AUs 1 through 3). The paucity of vertebrate faunal
remains from the Transitional Archaic period, AUs 4 and 5, does not permit comparisons with the
preceding Late Archaic or the subsequent Late Prehistoric period occupations.
8.7

Paleoenvironment

Table 8.16 summarizes the preferred habitats of the identified taxa recovered from AUs 6, 7, and 8,
which represent the Late Archaic occupation at site 41TR203. The identified taxa represent all
available local habitats and environs that include aquatic, riparian, grassland, deciduous forest, and
culturally modified landscapes. Since the Late Archaic occupants of the Mercado site unlikely were
engaging in agricultural activities, agricultural fields are unlikely to have existed as a habitat for
those taxa, but they are mentioned and included as a basis for possible early agricultural pursuits
along the West Fork of the Trinity River. Bison, deer, and pronghorn, the largest game animals,
also having the highest meat value, were undoubtedly the focal subsistence taxa hunted by the site
occupants during this period. Based on the elements present in the assemblage, local individuals
were likely hunted opportunistically, while more oftentimes the animal kill sites were some
distance from site 41TR203, and the high meat value bones were returned, or schlepped back, to
the site for further processing. Expansive grasslands with deciduous forests along the river would
be expected to be dominant during this period. Precipitation and temperatures were ideal for
maintaining the grassland and mixed deciduous forest habitats and ecotones, which has supportive
evidence in the presence of aquatic and riparian taxa also represented in the assemblage.

The large and medium-large vertebrate fauna that prevailed during the preceding Late Archaic
period (see above) is surpassed by the presence of shell middens during the Transitional Archaic
period (see above). This major shift in subsistence and procurement strategies may be associated
with climatic events that altered the preferred habitats of grazers and browsers such as the bison,
deer, and pronghorn. Or there was a shift in subsistence preferences that emphasized exploitation of
mollusks in the West Fork of the Trinity River. Given the presence of the shell middens, the river
must have had a reliable water flow that provided an ideal habitat for large numbers of mollusks.
Table 8.18 summarizes the identified taxa and their preferred habitats for AUs 1, 2, and 3 which
represent the Late Prehistoric occupation of site 41TR203. The limited taxa indicate habitats
consisting of mixed deciduous forest and grassland with riparian also represented. There are no
aquatic vertebrate taxa and only medium-large (e.g., deer) and small (e.g., cottontail, cotton rat,
wood rat) mammals are represented. The cottontail and deer would have been attracted to
agricultural fields if they existed. These taxa were likely hunted opportunistically when they
entered the vicinity of the Mercado site.

The oldest levels dating to 2740 to 2250 yr Cal BP (AUs 7 and 8) were dominated by grassland,
especially bison, and other open or edge species with moderate supplemental use of aquatic
species. After a very minimal presence of bison represented by fragmented teeth in AU 6 at
approximately 2000 yr Cal BP there is a complete absence of identifiable bison bone in any of the
AU 1 through 5 assemblages. Given the dominance of bison in the diet when available, the paucity
or absence of bison or large Bovidae indicates they rarely occurred within the site catchment area
after 2000 yr Cal BP through 1050 yr Cal BP. Also of note is that after approximately 2210 yr Cal
BP, represented by AU 7, there is an absence of any vertebrate aquatic habitat species, which is
interesting given the proximity of the West Fork of the Trinity River. This coincides with the
introduction of shell midden assemblages and may simply signify a shift from vertebrate to
invertebrate aquatic resources. Most of the aquatic species utilized, such as beaver, ducks, turtles,
and catfish, would tend to prefer slower moving or ponded waters, such as a slough, oxbow, or
slow meander. The shift in subsistence at this time may also indicate a change in the riverine
environment as well, and the mussel shell assemblage provides information pertinent to the type of
aquatic environment represented by those species during later occupations.
8.8

Subsistence Strategies

It is hard to discuss accurate usage of aquatic resources without the complimentary information on
findings regarding the mollusk analysis, but it appears only in the earliest assemblage, AU 8 of the
Mercado Site (41TR203)

309

July 2019

Late Archaic period, focused on the use of aquatic resources. Additionally, those resources seem to
either have been hunted (e.g., beaver and ducks) or gathered (e.g., turtles), with only minimal
fishing occurring as only one catfish bone was identified in the assemblage. Shifts after 2,000 years
ago suggest a reliance on deer, after which there is little diversity in the later Transitional Archaic
and Late Prehistoric assemblages.
8.9

Taphonomy

The preservation of bone at site 41TR203 is unique for North Texas assemblages of its age. A few
factors likely contributed to the siteâs preservation, including rapid sedimentation and burial of
material, likely from flood events of the West Fork of the Trinity River, and the substantial use of
mussel shell which, due to its calcareous nature, can alter soils to be less acidic and allow for better
bone preservation. There was substantial dry bone breakage at the site, but most bone was not
heavily weathered, and fragments tended to be larger than smaller, still in good condition, and not
brittle. There was some evidence for rodent gnawing and carnivore consumption (puncture and
digestive erosion), but its presence is minimal considering the amount of bone recovered. Overall,
few sites in Texas could come close to a similar level of preservation as the Mercado site.
8.10

Cultural Use of Bone

North Texas and the region surrounding Tarrant and Dallas counties tend to be poor in high quality
lithic resources. Expedient bone tools have been noted at other sites in the region, such as Fish
Creek Slough (41DL436), and were noted here at the Mercado site (41TR203) as well. When
processing bone for marrow, breaks tend to be sharp. Although they may become dull over time
and deposition, the working edges generally are retained with an angled edge, yet some bones in
the assemblage exhibited a polish from being held, used, and worn, with abraded edges being sharp
as they should be. Bone, unlike stone, cannot easily be re-sharpened, so once becoming dull
through use, most bone tools would have been discarded. In addition to the expedient bone tool
presence, there were a couple of long bone fragments that had been incised, although the bone was
too fragmentary to better identify the taxon or the toolâs function. Sites should be more closely
assessed to look at seeming raw bone for potential cultural modifications to glean a better picture of
expedient bone tool use in addition to other cultural use of bone.
The unique preservation and large faunal assemblage from the Mercado site have provided
knowledge about cultural lifeways, prehistoric human ecology, and environmental conditions

spanning approximately 2740 to 930 yr Cal BP at the Mercado site in north-central Texas along the
West Fork of the Trinity River. This information helps to fill a void where there has been little
direct knowledge of subsistence and paleoenvironmental data for this region of Texas during this
timeframe.

CHAPTER 9 â LITHICS

By: James W. Karbula and Robert Lassen
9.1

Introductions and Methods

In accordance with TxDOT Chipped Stone Analytical Protocol (TxDOT 2014), lithic artifacts were
separated into various taxonomic groups during analysis to help determine associations between
landscape, periods, groups, and regions and the manufacturing styles and techniques used among
the people who occupied these spaces. The analysis follows the basics of the Protocol outline for
both stone tools and debitage. All studied artifacts were coded with metrics on the TxDOT Stone
Tool Microsoft Excel recording forms.
Artifacts were initially separated into two taxonomic groups according to technology: chippedstone (the result of flint knapping) or ground stone (lithic manufacturing via the grinding or
pecking of one stone with another). Class was then used to further separate the tools (lithics
designed for intentional use/function) from the non-tools (lithics that cannot demonstrate
intentional use/function). When appropriate, artifacts were assigned an Analyst Specimen Number,
the formula for which begins with the Lot Number assigned in the field per unique provenience
followed by an analyst assigned number in numeric order. Analyst Specimen Numbers are
provided in this chapter when discussing unique artifacts which correspond with artifact tables and
photographs.
Those artifacts classified as chipped-stone tools were further separated into subgroups based upon
primary manufacturing technique: simple detachment-based, complex detachment-based, and
core-based. Simple detachment-based tools are considered those which required little to no
modification once detached (e.g., flakes or blades). Complex detachment-based and core-based
tools are those tools subject to substantial modification prior to use, including bifacial and unifacial
reduction (e.g., projectile points). Core-based tools, however, are distinguished by their
manufacture from material cores, as opposed to manufacture from detachments. Because the
difference between complex detachment-based tools and core-based tools lies in the initial piece
the tool was manufactured from, differentiation is difficult (TxDOT 2014).
Simple detachment-based tools were then separated into two classes: flakes and blades, further
distinguished by either modified or unmodified flakes or blades. Complex detachment-based and
Mercado Site (41TR203)

313

July 2019

core-based tools were separated into bifaces and non-bifaces, further distinguished by formal and
informal bifaces/non-bifaces. A formal tool is considered that which can be easily recognized by its
morphology due to the traditional manner in which the tool was manufactured. Conversely, an
informal tool cannot be recognized beyond that it is a complex detachment-based or core-based
tool. Complex detachment-based and/or core-based formal tools were identified by their function,
then identified within the classical typological system (Gary, Ellis, Ensor, etc.) (TxDOT 2014).
When analyzing the lithic collection from 41TR203, five stages of manufacture were recognized
per the TxDOT Protocol (2014). Stage 1 refers to the initial reduction. Pieces are recognized by the
presence of cortex and show signs of mass thinning, initial shaping, and âhard-hammer
percussion.â Stage 2 refers to blanks, those pieces which exhibit intentional reduction towards
develop into a tool. Minimal cortex may remain. Stage 3 refers to preform production, where a
generalized tool has been developed and only a minimal number of tools can be manufactured
moving forward. Significant reduction in thickness is visible and shaping and thinning of the tool is
what remains to be addressed. Stage 4 refers to tools that have been manufactured and need
marginal work to be completed (notching, edge grinding). Stage 5 refers to rejuvenated tools
marked by retouched edges, reduction in size, or remodeling (TxDOT 2014). Raw materials type
for tools (and for debitage) is generally observed and recorded in the following discussion and
quantified in the TxDOT Stone Tool recording forms.
Core based tools that are clearly bifacial (flaked on both sides of the artifact) are classified as
formal tools and then by function (arrow, dart, adze, knife) dependent upon size, thickness, number
of working edges, presence of hafting technology, and especially indications of use and resharpening, such as heavily modified blade or working edge lateral edge angles and impact
fractures. Utilized and re-sharpened projectile points are easily identified through altered lateral
edge angles and impact fractures. These types of artifacts were typically broken during resharpening and rejuvenation. Most of the projectiles at site 41TR203 exhibit utilized, re-sharpened,
and broken attributes during re-sharpening. Several of the darts at site 41TR203 strongly resemble
the Late Archaic Gary type with a contracting, pointed and tapering stem with a broad blade and
variable shoulders, which is a well-documented manufacturing trajectory for these formal tools.
Core-based or core-derived non-bifacial tools with one working unifacial edge (i.e., uniface) can
represent formal or informal tools based on intentional versus unintentional modification and
Mercado Site (41TR203)

314

determination of function (e.g., adze, knife, burin, end-scraper, drill, etc.). Unifaces can be
manufactured on flakes used for specific functions or unmodified expedient tools. These often
exhibit extensive cortex as a core-derived tool. Observations are recorded regarding productionrelated discard versus use-related discard. Tool breakage fracture patterns are evaluated in support
of this determination. Basic use wear studies were conducted of the projectile points to examine
where possible edge morphology flake scar patterns, edge construction types, wear patterning,
flaking attrition, crushing, smoothing, presence of polish, etching, and hafting evidence. Further
analysis of the lithic collection included indication of thermal alteration on the artifacts. Thermal
alteration is the intentional subjection of the lithic to fire in order to more easily work the piece.
Due to the difficulty in determining whether a piece was intentionally subjected to fire or
incidentally subjected to fire, all pieces visibly subjected to heat were termed thermally altered.
An estimation of percent cortex was undertaken for the flakes. Debitage was grouped in the
following percentages: 0 percent, 1 to 25 percent, 26 to 50 percent, 51 to 75 percent, 76 to 100
percent.
9.2

Stone Tools

A total of 394 lithic items were collected from data recovery investigations in 4 open excavation
blocks (A, B, C, and F) and 1 geoarchaeological trench investigation at site 41TR203 (excluding
shatter). Of the 27 tools recovered, 13 are considered formal tools, 9 informal tools, and 5
otherwise classified. Twelve of these are complete or fragmented projectile points, six are biface
fragments (209.01, 211.01, 118.01, 228.01, 251.01, and 247.01), seven are modified or unmodified
utilized flakes (51.01, 89.01, 223.01, and 145.01, 103.01. 165.02, 192.04), and one is a ground
stone fragment in four pieces which do not conjoin (144.01) (Table 9.1). Six of the darts are
complete specimens (136.01, 209.02, 254.01, 90.01, 90.02, and 264.01), and six are fragments
(250.01, 73.01, 237.01, 276.01, 136.03 and 151.01). One flake is identified as a small flake-blade
preform, narrow and blade-like in shape, with a distinct dorsal ridge (58.01). Projectile points are
also classified by AU and by feature in Table 9.1. All studied artifacts were coded with metrics on
the TxDOT Stone Tool recording forms.

Projectile Points (n = 12)
Gary Projectile Points (n = 5)

Four projectile points may represent variants of the Gary Late Archaic type commonly found in in
northeast Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas (Larsen and Larsen 2018; Turner et al. 2011;
Mercado Site (41TR203)

316

July 2019

Suhm and Jelks 1962; Prikryl 1990; Turner et al. 2002) (Photo 9.1). The chronological range is
typically Late Archaic to Early Woodland (4000 to 1000 yr Cal BP). These tend to be thick,
medium to large, triangular bladed contracting stem projectile points with indistinct squared
shoulders that may be slightly barbed or have an upward taper. The points exhibit medium to long,
contracting, pointed to rounded stem bases. Stems can also be slightly expanding with a convex
base. Gary variants typically exhibit a random flaking pattern and heavily re-sharpened blades.

Photo 9.1. Gary Points Recovered from 41TR203 (from Left to Right: 254.01, 136.01, 209.02,
and 250.01)
Specimen 254.01 is made on a coarse-grained gray chert. The blade lateral edge angles are heavily
altered, indicating use and re-sharpening (Stage 5; TxDOT 2014). The shoulders are indistinct but
slightly barbed, the stem markedly contracting, and the base pointed. The flaking pattern is random
and crude. Flaking attrition indicates bifacial wear consistent with use in cutting, and distal polish
suggests piercing. Though it was almost certainly hafted, no polish indicative of hafting was
observable at 20x. Specimen 136.01 is a smaller projectile point manufactured on a white, opaque
chalcedony-like material. The blade is re-sharpened and the artifact reused and re-sharpened (Stage
5). One shoulder is slightly flared and the other indistinct. The stem is markedly contracting and

tapering to the pointed base. Bifacial attrition along the lateral blade edges indicates cutting use,
but no polish was observable under 20x magnification. Specimen 209.02 is manufactured on a finegrained gray chert. The triangular blade edges are relatively straight and even, but exhibit altered
lateral edge angles on both edges at the distal tip, and it is, therefore, a Stage 5 utilized and resharpened artifact. The stem is markedly contracting and the base slightly convex. The shoulders
are somewhat barbed. Traces of cortex are present along the base. This artifact may have been
much larger before extensive re-sharpening. The blade edges exhibit bifacial flaking attrition and
shallow polish, along with polish on the stem, indicating that the point was hafted and used for
cutting. Specimen 250.01 is another Stage 5 heavily utilized and re-sharpened projectile point. This
small dart exhibits significantly altered and damaged blade lateral edge angles, and a significant
impact fracture emanating from the distal tip. The dart is manufactured on a fine-grained tan
material. The shoulders are heavily re-sharpened; the stem markedly contracting to the pointed or
rounded base. Bifacial attrition and shallow polish along the blade edges, along with the impact
damage, indicate that the point had pierced and cut materials. Proximal polish demonstrates that the
point was hafted.
One projectile point bears affinities to the well-documented Gary projectile point type and is likely
of similar age range (Photo 9.2). Specimen 264.01 is a small, triangular bladed projectile point with
extensively altered lateral edge angles indicating a Stage 5 finished, utilized, and re-sharpened
artifact. The artifact is manufactured on a fine-grained, slightly purple banded chert and may
exhibit evidence of thermal alteration. The shoulders are well pronounced. The contracting stem is
broken due to impact burination and the base missing except for along one edge. Like most points,
it exhibits bifacial cutting attrition along its blade edge, along with shallow polish. Signs of hafting
were likely obliterated in the proximal damage, however. The artifact exhibits the size, blade shape,
and contracting stem of Late Archaic Gary points.

9.2.1.2

Wells Projectile Point (n = 1)

One projectile point is morphologically similar to the documented Wells projectile point type.
These artifacts are long, narrow darts with distinct to weak shoulders and a long contracting stem
(Turner et al. 2011:170; Prewitt 1974; Prikryl 1990, Shafer 1963; Suhm and Jelks 1962). These are
typically Middle Archaic projectile points (6000â4500 yr Cal BP) and collected from east Texas,
east central Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Specimen 90.01 is a long, slender, narrow
projectile point (see Photo 9.2). The artifact is manufactured on a fine-grained tan-brown chert. The
blade is extensively re-sharpened, and almost reworked to a drill-like tip. The shoulders are
indistinct and the stem is long, narrow, contacting, and tapering. The base is straight to slightly
convex. The blade exhibits bifacial edge attrition, along with shallow lateral and deep distal polish,
consistent with piercing and cutting. The stem is also slightly polished, indicating hafting.
9.2.1.3

Ensor/Ellis Projectile Point (n = 1)

One projectile point is identified as Ensor with Ellis affiliations (90.02) (see Photo 9.2). The artifact
is small and thick with a heavily re-sharpened blade, side or corner notches, a markedly expanding
stem, and a convex base. This point exhibits bifacial edge attrition as well as shallow distal and
Mercado Site (41TR203)

lateral polish on the blade, consistent with use as a projectile point. Additional stem polish
indicates hafting. It is manufactured on a fine-grained gray chert. Turner et al. (2011) suggest that
there is a wide range of variation among basal shapes of Ensor points with a chronology that spans
the Transitional Archaic (~2200 to 1400 yr Cal BP). They are geographically widespread in central
and south Texas. The artifact morphology fits well within the documented range of variability for
Ensor points (Anthony and Brown 1994; Karbula 2000, Prikryl 1990; Story et al. 1990; Suhm and
Jelks 1962). In fact, the morphological variation of many projectile points of the Texas Late
Archaic and Transitional Archaic intervals has led to the recognition of an Ensor- Frio-Fairland
continuum, all of similar age and varying morphologies. Turner et al. (2011:93) also suggest that
Ellis projectile points can be difficult to distinguish morphologically from Ensor. And the
geographic distribution of Ellis points overlaps the location of 41TR203 in Tarrant County, northcentral Texas. The temporal range for Ellis is Late to Transitional Archaic, and they have been
dated to early as 3000 yr Cal BP (Turner et al. 2011:93).
9.2.1.4

Miscellaneous Forms (n = 5)

Five artifacts are identified as miscellaneous projectile point forms (Photo 9.3). Two are
broad-bladed triangular projectiles that can be generally assigned to Late Archaic, based on size
and general morphology. One of these is a fragment missing the distal portion of the artifact
(237.01). The lateral blade edges that remain are extremely sinuous and uneven. The flaking is
irregular. This dart may have been broken during final thinning of the blade based on the perverse
fracture (Stage 4, Final Stage). Additionally, there is a lack of edge attrition and polish, suggesting
it was not used. The dart exhibits wide corner notches and one shoulder is very strong and
pronounced. The stem is contracting and the base slightly convex. Another broad triangular bladed
specimen (151.01) is manufactured on a fine-grained light tan chert. One shoulder and the base are
missing. One corner notch is an indication of hafting. The artifact is Stage 5, utilized and resharpened, as the blade is extensively re-sharpened. Bifacial edge attrition indicates cutting use.
Another fragment represents a miscellaneous distal tip (276.01, not depicted). The shoulders may
be intact and are very indistinct, but the base is missing. The proximal break was reworked into a
scraper edge. The scraper edge and one lateral edge exhibit shallow unifacial scraping attrition, as
well as shallow polish. The artifact is Stage 5, utilized and heavily re-sharpened.

Another specimen is bifacial and a possible project point (73.01). It is triangular in form with no
notches or shoulders. The intact stem is slightly expanding and the base is straight suggestive of
hafting. The blade is extensively re-sharpened (Stage 5), and there is a significant impact fracture
emanating from the distal tip. It exhibits bifacial attrition on one edge and unifacial on the other,
with shallow polish present on the lateral and proximal edges as well. A final artifact, 136.03, is a
very small distal point fragment. The thickness indicates that it is likely from a dart point, but no
other typological information can be discerned. It is made on heat-treated chert. It exhibits bifacial
edge attrition but no observable polish.

9.2.2

Bifaces (n = 6)

The biface fragments are small, crude, and trend toward expedient use of available materials.
Specimen 209.01 is thick and crudely sharpened on a small chert cobble (Photo 9.4). Two very
sinuous crude edges are apparent and the tool is covered in approximately 70 percent cortex.
Bifacial flaking attrition is visible on one edge, along with shallow lateral and distal polish,
suggesting the tool was used for cutting and piercing activities. Specimen 211.01 is a crude
fragment manufactured on a quartz cobble. Although some bifacial and unifacial edge attrition is
Mercado Site (41TR203)

321

July 2019

visible, polish could not be discerned due to the shiny nature of the material. Specimen 118.01 is
another small, thick, crude, seemingly expedient piece manufactured on a small chert cobble with
rough sinuous edges and extensive cortex (approximately 40 percent). Bifacial edge attrition was
noted on both lateral edges, as well as deep polish, indicating it may have been used to cut soft
material. Biface fragment 251.01 is a flake removed from the lip of a biface exhibiting one sinuous
bifacial edge which appears to have been re-sharpened into a burin-like point. The lateral edges
exhibit bifacial flaking attrition, along with deep polish on the edges and tip, indicating piercing
and cutting soft material. The piece was likely broken during re-sharpening.
Specimen 228.01 is well-thinned, bifacial, and exhibits one steeply beveled edge that appears to be
unifacial and the primary working edge of the tool. The two unifacially modified scraping edges
exhibit unifacial flaking attrition, with bifacial attrition on the one bifacial edge. Shallow polish is
also present, suggesting the scraping or cutting of harder materials. All of these biface fragments
are small and would fit comfortably between the thumb and forefinger during use. Specimen
247.01 is a flake representing the removal of a bifacial edge or lip during rejuvenation.

Utilized Flakes (n = 7)

These artifacts are all small, utilized flakes, either intentionally modified or unmodified, for
expedient use, and typically exhibit edge damage (Photo 9.5). Uniface 145.01 is a thick flake from
a small broken chert cobble, that appears to have been expediently modified resulting in a crude
unifacial edge thinned on one side and also with extensive cortex. The artifact was probably used
as an expedient cutting or slicing tool. The worked edge exhibits some unifacial attrition, but no
polish was observable. Specimen 145.01 may represent a flake from a core altered steeply on one
edge for expedient use as a cutting or slicing tool. Specimen 51.01 is lenticular in shale and bladelike, with a distinct dorsal ridge. This artifact is interpreted to represent an unmodified flake bladetool for expedient use and appears to exhibit edge damage. The one modified edge has unifacial use
attrition, but no polish was noted. Specimen 223.01 is a small, thick modified flake with
approximately 30 percent cortex and a pronounced unifacial edge on the dorsal side of the flake.
Specimen 223.01 may represent a crude flake from a core intentionally modified or nibbled along
one unifacial edge for use as an end scraper. The distal and both lateral edges exhibit conforming
microscopic attrition, along with shallow polish that may be associated with scraping hard
materials. Uniface 89.01 is a small, thin modified flake fragment with a pronounced ânibbledâ or
worked unifacial edge also on the dorsal face that is not well pronounced. This artifact may
represent a recycled flake modified on one edge for use an end scraper. The distal modified edge
exhibits unifacial edge attrition and deep polish, possibly indicative of scraping soft material.
Uniface 103.01 (not pictured) is a small but thick cortical flake with a distal end that has been
trimmed to a steep scraper bevel. Itâs microscopic use-wear exhibits unifacial attrition on the distal
end and shallow polish, suggesting the scraping of hard material. Uniface 192.04 (not pictured) is a
short flake with roughly 75 percent cortex and a unifacially modified distal edge. It also exhibits
distal unifacial edge attrition and the shallow polish associated with scraping hard material. Finally,
165.02 is a modified flake fragment with a utilized, slightly concave edge. This worked edge has
microscopic attrition, shallow polish, and was likely used as a spokeshave for working hafts or
shafts. Similar to the bifaces in the collection, all are small pieces that would be navigable between
two fingers for focused scraping activities. All seven pieces exhibit one apparent âworkedâ edge,
from simple observation, but is difficult to determine at this level of analysis whether all of these
three represent intentional alteration or more expedient tools with edge damage from use.

Lithic Debitage

A total of 390 pieces of lithic debitage were collected from the site (Tables 9.2 and 9.3). These
were broken down into four size classes (1-in [Photo 9.6], 3/4-in [Photo 9.7], 1/2-in [Photo 9.8] and
1/4-in) and then further categorized as either complete, broken, or fragmentary flakes, or shatter in
accordance with the Sullivan and Rozen (1985) âinterpretation-freeâ typology. Thermal alteration,
percent cortex, material type, and other unique attributes were recorded. Minimum Number of
Nodules (MNN) are assessed, and platform types are evaluated. Form completeness is addressed, a
size-grade analysis is conducted, and percent cortex studied and quantified. The results are then
examined for the collection as a whole, by AU, and by feature where appropriate. All studied
artifacts were coded with metrics on the TxDOT Core and Debitage recording forms.

The lower deposits (AUs 6 through 8) contained almost 90 percent of the lithic debitage (n = 349),
and approximately 90 percent of the formal tools (n = 19). The smallest pressure flakes and biface
thinning flakes (1/4-in sieve) representing final stage sharpening and re-sharpening predominated
in the AU 7 assemblage both in terms of whole flakes and flake fragments (55 whole flakes, 20
broken flakes, 37 flake fragments). Flakes on the 1/2-in sieve were present in relatively small
numbers in AU 7 (11 whole flakes, 4 broken flakes, and 9 fragments). Larger flakes (3/4-in and 1in sieves) were present in the AU 7 assemblage and represented initial-stage thinning and tool
manufacture primarily with fist-size or smaller cores (101 whole flakes, 16 broken flakes, and 46
fragments). Many of these larger flakes exhibited extensive cortex (Photo 9.9). A small number of
the whole flakes and flake fragments are recorded as thermally altered (Photo 9.10). There was no
evidence of larger cores, fist-sized or larger cores, or core fragments in the site as a whole, nor in
AU 7. Core reduction occurred with easily transported materials or small cobbles in the immediate
vicinity.

Flakes with cortex remnant were only present in AUs 7 and 8, and in Features 35, 37, 38, 41, 43,
and 44 (Tables 9.4 through 9.7). Only Feature 43 is positively identified as a basined hearth.
Feature 43 contained only one half-inch flake with cortex. The remainder of these features are
loosely categorized as earth oven lid rock/rake-out or discard piles, dumps, or alternatively
potentially a small hearth (see Chapter 7). Flakes with cortex were thus common in the sheet
midden of cultural debris that represents AUs 6 through 8 (see Chapter 10). A total of 75 larger
flakes with cortex (1-in and 3/4-in) versus 35 flakes on the smaller sieves (1/2-in and 1/4-in) with
cortex, indicates both initial stage and later stage reduction and manufacture of formal tools from
small cobble size or smaller cores (see below). Cortex percentages are recorded in Tables 9.4
through 9.7. Not surprisingly, all of the flakes on the 1/4-in and 1/2-in sieves (n = 35) are 50
percent cortex or less. Perhaps surprisingly, only 9 of the 75 flakes with cortex on the 3/4-in and 1in sieves exhibit 50 to 100 percent cortex. Approximately 32 percent of the flakes (n = 110 of 347,
both whole and fragmentary) in AUs 7 and 8 exhibit cortex. This aspect may indicate that later
stage thinning, sharpening in support of tool production and re-sharpening of utilized tools, were
more important activities at the site rather than initial stage reduction and preform manufacture.

Flakes with heat treatment in the form of thermal preparation or burning were recorded solely as
thermally altered. Per the TxDOT Protocol (2014), âit is difficult to distinguish between
purposefully treated materials from those that were incidentally burnedâ (p. 28). Based on this
aspect, âdebitage should be recorded as thermally altered, not altered, or indeterminateâ¦.and
conservativelyâ (p. 28). Further, âidentifying alteration on pieces of insufficient mass is
unreliableâ¦all pieces recovered below the 1/2-in sieve should be recorded as indeterminateâ (p.
28) (TxDOT 2014). Given the small numbers of identified thermally altered flakes in the collection
(n = 29), and over 40 percent collected on the 1/4-in sieve (n = 14), thermal alteration at the site
does not represent a significant line of research. A few thermally altered pieces of debitage were
identified (Table 9.8), and a small number of these were pot lidded. Alteration was observed in the
form of a purple discoloration, cracking, spalling, and pot lidding in these few specimens. All of
the thermally altered flakes were identified in AUs 7 and 8, and related features include Features
38, 41, and 44 (see Photo 9.10).

Flake Platforms

Flake platforms in this assemblage are characterized as abraded, faceted, multi-faceted, complex,
flat, cortical, crushed, and indeterminate, based on the classification system laid out in the TxDOT
Chipped Stone Analytical Protocol (TxDOT 2014). Table 9.9 lists the counts for each platform type
Mercado Site (41TR203)

July 2019

per AU. In the Late Prehistoric component (AUs 1 through 3), very few flakes with preserved
platforms were encountered, but the ones that could be identified were flat, indicating an expedient
core flaking technology was utilized. The Transitional Archaic component (AUs 4 and 5) is similar,
with the majority of identifiable flake platforms being flat or cortical. However, one faceted
platform is present to indicate more careful core preparation. In the Late Archaic component (AUs
6 through 8), far more debitage is present, enabling a better understanding of the knapping
activities taking place. Flat and cortical platforms are present in roughly equal numbers compared
to abraded and faceted platforms. This duality indicates that expedient flake core knapping and
early stage reduction were occurring in conjunction with later stage flake production and biface
thinning. As tool production becomes more formalized, and the flaking requirements become more
precise, the flintknapper must pay increased attention to the preparation of each flaking platform.
As such, preparations such as faceting and abrading are signs of late stage knapping of formal
tools, such as bifaces, prismatic blades, and some unifaces.

Raw Materials

A variety of chert material types were observed in the debitage collection (AUs 6 through 8). The
in-situ context of the cultural deposits, especially in AU 7, was excellent based on observed chert
material types. Most if not nearly all Lots (proveniences) from unit and feature contexts exhibited
flakes all of a consistent chert material type, specific to that unit or feature location, implying flakes
were removed off the same nodule. In provenience after provenience, flakes were all of a consistent
chert material type that varied between locations. Different test units and features exhibited

Mercado Site (41TR203)

333

July 2019

different chert material types, but within each specific context, flakes were of only one or two
material types, and nearly all of the feature-associated flakes were the same parent material. This is
highly indicative of an intact context.
Raw material analysis was conducted using the MNN technique. For this technique, materials are
separated by archeological component then grouped according to similarities that would suggest
that they may have been derived from the same cobble. In this respect, it is similar to the
âminimum number of individualsâ that is assessed in faunal analysis. In this analysis, the first step
in grouping the raw material for each component was to observe their reactions under long wave
ultraviolet light. Chert from the Edwards Formation of central Texas is known to fluoresce orange
under long wave UV light, while most other materials from the Southern Plains do not (Hofman et
al. 1991). Thus, the debitage from each component was first sorted into âEdwardsâ and âNot
Edwardsâ categories. Then, materials were sorted based on visual characteristics under natural
light, such as color, mottling, inclusions, and texture. Tables 9.10 through 9.12 give the results of
the MNN analysis for each component.

Even in the artifact-sparse upper two components, the MNN analysis reveals a variety of raw
materials in use: a minimum of six nodules for the Late Prehistoric and seven for the Transitional
Archaic. In the larger Late Archaic component, a minimum of 25 nodules are represented.
However, the most well represented materials in all the components are the gray and tan varieties
of Edwards chert. Non-Edwards materials are also notably present in all components but are not as
abundant as the Edwards cherts. Additionally, cortex is observed for most of the material types, and
in all cases, it is the smooth, dense cortex that is typical of stream cobbles.
There has been a question of whether any of the raw materials observed at the Mercado site
originated from the outcrops at what is now Fort Hood in Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas. The
evidence presented above strongly suggests that none of the materials at this site came from the
Fort Hood area. The presence of stream-derived cortex on the vast majority of the materials
indicates that river-tumbled cobbles are the primary, and possibly the only, source of knappable
stone at the site. Fort Hood is a primary geologic chert source, so any of the materials from there
would exhibit either bedrock-derived cortex, or none at all if blanks were knapped at the source.
Moreover, the Mercado site materials often exhibit stream-derived cortex on even the smallest
flakes, suggesting that relatively small river cobbles were likely used. Although a diversity of raw
materials is present at this site, it is possible that they could all derive from a single local riverine
source.
9.7

Ground Stone (n = 1)

Four fragments of one ground stone artifact were documented in the collection (144.01). The pieces
do not refit, but they are of the same material (sandstone), likely part of the same artifact, and were
recovered together. The largest piece (approximately 1.5 by 1-in) is a thin slab (1 cm in height),
with a thin outer edge and exhibits two very smooth grinding facets, one on each side of the
artifact.
9.8

Summary

The collection as a whole can be categorized at the bottom of the site deposits (105â145 cmbs) as
containing diagnostic projectiles of the Late Archaic Interval in the form of Gary and Ensor/ Ellis
projectile points. Figure 9.1 illustrates the distribution of stone tools in AUs 6 through 8 in
association with cultural features. The primarily Late Archaic aspect of these projectile point types
overlaps the approximate 2700 to 2100 yr Cal BP timeline for the lower site deposits (AUs 6

through 8), as established by a series of 2-sigma radiocarbon ages, many in feature context, and by
geomorphic studies. The lower assemblage contains all Late Archaic or miscellaneous darts with
no admixture from later time periods, small biface fragments, and small utilized flakes, and in
small numbers. The assemblage is consistent with limited hunting activities at the site, including
projectile point and biface manufacture and re-sharpening. Overall, the site appears to have been an
open, seasonally occupied campsite where a limited set of activities occurred, at least in the Late
Archaic interval.

CHAPTER 10 â MUSSEL ANALYSIS

By: Traci Popejoy
This chapter describes the freshwater mussel fauna from site 41TR203. The species composition
of different analytical units is explored. An analysis of the taphonomic processes affecting the
assemblage is included to describe potential preservation effects on unionid species
representation. Using Dr. Robert Warrenâs program UNIO and the relative abundance of mussel
species remains, a description of past riverine habitat is provided.
Freshwater mussels (hereinafter may be referred to as just mussels) are benthic bivalves within
the family Unionidae. These organisms used to be ubiquitous among the eastern United States
and have experienced population declines since the early twentieth century (Haag and Williams
2014). Mussel shells were used as spoons and hoes, but more-often represent a âstress foodâ for
hunter and gatherers (Claassen 1998; Parmalee and Klippel 1974). They provide many cultural
and provisioning ecosystem services to modern cultures (Vaughn 2017).
10.1

Materials and Methods

Mussels leave a chiral pair of calcium carbonate shell per individual. Specimen can be quantified
by the

presence

of

ânon-repetitive

elementsâ

(NRE),

which

for

mussels

is

an

umbo/psuedocardinal teeth pair indicative of either the left or right shell of one organism (Mason
et al. 1998; Giovas 2009). Thus, NRE represents the number of individuals in an assemblage and
can often be identified to fine taxonomic levels (most often to species). âNumber of specimensâ
(NSP) is used to count identified and unidentified specimens, such as outer shell margins, within
the assemblage. NSP is not indicative of a single organism as there may be numerous
unidentifiable or identifiable fragments from one shell (unlike umbos, which usually survive
intact). For quick enumeration, only NRE will be discussed in this report.
While complete identification is ideal when discussing molluscan diversity (Woo et al. 2015),
partial identification of assemblages can reveal some information about the community structure.
The goal of this analysis was to quantify the community structure among all AUs. As such, lots

Mercado Site (41TR203)

340

July 2019

were chosen for identification with the goal to identify an equal number of lots among the
analytical units. The number of NRE was different among different lots and among analytical
units; lots from the same analytical units tended to be the same size. Assuming lots have similar
size and identifiability, we can estimate the number of NRE within this assemblage then estimate
the percentage of the shells identified among different analytical units (Table 10.1). AUs 2, 3,
and 6 were small and thus almost all lots were identified. AUs 1, 4, 5, and 7 potentially contained
many shells and are potentially under-sampled (Woo et al. 2015). In total, there are an estimated
4,344 shells within the assemblage and 981 were counted. Thus, an estimated 23 percent of the
total assemblage was sampled.
Below is Table 10.1, which is the estimated NRE in each AU and the number actually counted.
Estimated NRE in AU was calculated by multiplying the mean NRE per lot by the total number
of lots within the AU; then the NRE identified was divided by the estimated NRE to get
percentage counted.

Specimens were identified, counted, and measured from randomly chosen lots among all AUs.
Identifications relied on characteristics discussed in the systematic paleontology (below) and in
Howells (2013). Modern shells within the Oklahoma Biological Surveyâs comparative collection
were also consulted, though these specimens are from the Little and Kiamichi Rivers in
Oklahoma. Shells were measured for length (the most typical malacological measure of mussel

size) and pallial line-to-lateral teeth length (highly correlated with shell length, and precise on
fragmented shells) (Randklev et al. 2009).

Freshwater Mussel Diversity

Fusconaia sp. is the most abundant species present in site 41TR203 (Figure 10.1, Table 10.2). In
total, 15 taxa were identified from the assemblage. Multiple identifiers are used to indicate
moderately unidentifiable specimen (Table 10.2); when species could be eliminated, they were.
While specimens were identified to the lowest taxonomic level as possible, some could not,
especially within the Pleurobemini tribe (see Systematic Paleontology). To address this
difference in identification specificity, we address taxonomic shifts among AUs using the
taxonomic tribe (Figure 10.2).

Figure 10.1. Aggregated Abundance of Mollusk Taxa
Table 10.2, below, shows the aggregated abundances of specimen within site 41TR203. Taxa
with asterisks denote species of conservation concern; L. satura and F. chunni are listed as
threatened by the state of Texas while P. riddelli are state threatened and petitioned for listing
under the Endangered Species Act.

Figure 10.2. Mussel Tribes
As depicted in Figure 10.2, there is an abundance of different mussel tribes within each
analytical unit. Colors correspond to different mussel tribes based on Haag (2012). If the tribe is
listed as NA, the non-repetitive element is either a gastropod or a fossilized marine shell.
Percentages represent the estimated proportion of the analytical unit quantified.

As illustrated in Figure 10.3, the tribe follows Haag (2012). Grey boxes delimit analytical units.
Numbers above feature bars are the total NRE counted from the feature. It is important to
remember that âzooarcheological measures of taxonomic abundance are ordinal scale, at bestâ
(Grayson 1984b; Wolverton 2013; Wolverton et al. 2014). Systematic paleontology is provided
to assess data quality, as suggested by Driver (1992) and Wolverton (2013). Specimen were also
re-identified to address identification fidelity. Of the two lots re-identified, most identifications
were consistent, with a tendency to be more conservative (and identify to a broader taxonomic
level) during re-identification.
10.3

Taphonomy

When discussing sample fidelity, it is important to address taphonomy or âthe study of the
transition, in all details, of organics from the biosphere into the lithosphere or geological recordâ
(Lyman 1994). Taphonomic analysis was conducted for the freshwater mussel assemblage using
Wolverton et al. (2010)âs conceptual model (Figure 10.4). Different mussel species produce
different shells, relating to their habitat conditions; this phenotype is related to habitat
preferences with certain substrates favoring lighter, more inflated shells. Thus, different unionid
species have shells with distinctive preservation potential. Wolverton et al. (2010) analyzed the
preservation potential of freshwater mussel shells based on two physical characteristics: shell
sphericity and shell density. The authors found that as shell sphericity increases, preservation
potential increases regardless of shell density; as shell density increases so does preservation
potential. While they quantified density and sphericity of shell from the Brazos River, we take
their density and sphericity values as representative of the Trinity River fauna as well.
Based on Wolverton et al.âs (2010) conceptual model, preservation within the assemblage is
moderate. The most abundant taxa (Fusconaia spp. and C. mortoni) are of only moderate
preservation potential and there are multiple species of low preservation potential (L. teres and L.
hydiana) present within this assemblage. For Figure 10.4C, robusticity was estimated by ranking
the summed sphericity and density scores of known individuals and then determining where the
species with missing density and sphericity would be on this gradient. In this graph, we expect

Mercado Site (41TR203)

345

the highest abundance for those with the highest preservation potential (P. dombeyanus and A.
plicata). The moderate preservation of this assemblage recommends it to full analysis if possible.

are explained in Table 10.2.
Preservation can also be quantified through the amount of unidentified material in the
assemblage. For the subset sampled: 19.9 percent of NRE are unidentifiable while 39.3 percent
could not be identified to a specific species or clade. Of the 1478 specimens counted, 62.7
percent contain non-repetitive elements.
10.4

Paleoenvironmental Reconstruction

A paleoenvironmental reconstruction based upon the NRE present in each analytical unit was
derived using Warrenâs (1991) software program UNIO (Version 3) (Warren 1991) (Figure
10.5). UNIO assesses four habitat variables based on either NTAXA (taxa identified) or NRE:
water depth, current velocity, substrate composition and habitat type.

Water depth was

quantified between 0.0 dm to 46 dm (0 to 4.6 m). Current velocity was categorized as strong
âSW,â moderate âMO,â slow âSL,â and standing âST.â Substrate composition was defined as
cobble-gravel âC-G,â gravel âG,â gravel-sand âG-S,â sand âS,â sand-mud âS-M,â and mud âM.â
Finally, waterbody type was defined as Large River âLR,â Medium River âMR,â Small River
âSR,â Large Creek âLC,â Small Creek âSC,â and Lake âL.â Species were assigned numerical
weights (0, 0.5, and 1) based on published habitat preferences; thus, if a species was routinely
reported to occur in a gravel-sand substrate, then a score of 1 would be assigned for that
environmental variable. In total, UNIO determines the percentage of an archeological
assemblage that is adapted to a particular habitat category (see Morey and Crothers 1998;
Warren 1991 for an in-depth discussion of UNIO). As the UNIO program was not created for
Texas freshwater mussel communities, some Mississippi taxa were used as proxies for endemic
Texas species.

The following species are not included in the UNIO program: Cyclonaias

mortoni, Lampsilis hydiana, Pleurobema ridilli, and Quadrula apiculata. For missing species,
the following species were used instead, respectively, because they share similar ecological
requirements: Quadrula pustulosa (recently renamed to Cyclonaias pustulosa), L. siliquoidea, P.
cordatum, and Q. quadrula (Howells 2013; Howells et al. 1996; Williams et al. 2008; Williams
et al. 2017). Species only identified to tribe were grouped with the most abundant species within
Mercado Site (41TR203)

347

July 2019

that tribe (for example Lampsilini species were included with L. teres counts). Tables 10.3 and
10.4 show the percentage of assemblage that are found in those habitats by analytical unit, while
Figure 10.5 depicts a boxplot of different habitat values, aggregating to a mean habitat variable
for site 41TR203 with all analytical units having equal weight.
Based on the results generated by the UNIO program, the freshwater mussel assemblage from
site 41TR203 was adapted to a small river with shallow waters (<1.5 m). These river reaches
exhibited both variable velocity with small gravel and sand substrate. The shallow water depth is
expected due to mussel ecology and could be indicative of mussel harvest in shallow waters by
native peoples. The abundance of many Pleurobelemini individuals, specifically Fusconaia spp.,
are indicative of a headwater stream (Haag 2012). Lampsilini species such as L. hydiana and L.
teres are most often found within sandbanks, near slow waters.
The program UNIO uses modern observations of mussel habitat preference to determine which
habitats archeological freshwater mussel shell might have lived in. Each analytical unit was run
through the program to produce its own habitat characteristics.

Oxygen Isoptopes

As freshwater mussels feed from the surrounding water, assimilate the relevant material, and
deposit nacreous shell layers as they grow, the chemical composition of a musselâs shell should
reflect the isotopic signatures of their environment. As mussels are long lived organisms and
generally cease growth at low temperatures, their shell represents long term trends in isotopic
signatures of water during their growing season (Dettmann et al. 1999). Heavy oxygen isotope
ratio within mussel shell is driven by water temperature and stream water isotopic ratio. A
streamâs heavy oxygen isotope ratio is a result of the source of water (precipitation or snow melt)
and the amount of evaporation occurring within the river. In a metadata analysis, 95 percent of
the variation in freshwater mussel shell Î´18O was explained by the stream water Î´18O, which is
often driven by latitudinal differences in precipitation (Pfister et al. 2019). While there are
species-specific growth cessation temperatures, freshwater mussels generally stop growth (and
thus depositing shell with isotopic signatures) during the winter or at temperatures below 12Â°C
(Dettmann et al. 1999).
The heavy oxygen isotope ratios found in shell from 41TR203 exhibit remarkable variation but
generally follow the climatic trends found for this region during the late Holocene. Using the
time frames presented for each AU in Table 10.5, we find that the mean Î´18O increases from 4.00 o/oo at 2600 BP to -3.71 o/oo at 990 BP (Figure 10.6). Mussel shell from AUs 2, 4, and 5
(time period 1815 BP to 1380 BP) have highly variable Î´18O values (Table 10.5). This could be a
result of different habitats sampled, or could be indicative of quick climate shifts from dry to wet
periods, or could be the result of admixture within the assemblage.

Denton Creek (Brown 1989).

Temperature modeling for modern shells over-estimated the water temperature by 3 to 5Â°C; this
might represent a calibration issue for paleoclimatic modeling of water temperatures (Van
Plantinga and Grossman, 2018). As both source Î´18O and temperature shift through time in
freshwater, estimating temperatures from Î´18O values from archeological freshwater mussel
shells is tenuous (Dettman et al. 1999). Thus, temperature is not extrapolated from the Î´18O
values but instead discussed as larger trends evident within the data.
When comparing this analysis with other assessments of paleoclimate in North Central Texas
during this region, the heavy oxygen isotopic ratio support that this region underwent slight
cooling during the late Holocene. Humphries and Ferring (1992) posit that while middle
Holocene temperatures generally match late Holocene and current temperatures, their carbon
isotopic data indicate that the middle Holocene was more dry (higher evaporation and thus more
negative Î´18O values) than the early and late Holocene. Data from site 41TR203 match this
conclusion as a general increase in Î´18O values is seen, indicating less evaporation or more
precipitation was occurring during this period. Brown (1998) found similar Î´18O values in
mussel shell deposited at site 41DL270 on Denton Creek as those found within site 41TR203
during a similar time span. Denton Creek represents a smaller tributary on the West Fork of the
Trinity River, while site 41TR203 is on the mainstem of the East Fork of the Trinity River. This
difference in river network position could explain the slightly higher Î´18O values; the smaller
stream might be more heavily forested (based on the river continuum concept) and thus, might
experience less evaporation. While Î´18O ratios are slightly different, the general increase in Î´18O
values would indicate that this region was experiencing more precipitation and/or lower
temperatures as the late Holocene continued.

Systematic Paleontology

Class: Bivalvia
Family: Unionidae
Tribe: Amblemini

Mercado Site (41TR203)

July 2019

Genus: Amblema
Species: Amblema plicata (Threeridge)
Amblema plicata is oval to rectangular with three to seven distinctive ridges. This species is
thick, moderately inflated with a high, bulbous beak. The pseudocardinal teeth of this species are
large, rough, and triangular. The right pseudocardinal tooth is angled toward the middle of the
ventral margin. This species is robust (and thus often preserve well) and is moderately tolerant of
low water quality and can inhabit both streams and lakes (Howells et al. 1996).
Tribe: Pleuroblemini
Specimen identified to this group either exhibited characteristics of both Fusconaia and
Pluerobema or did not have distinctive enough characteristics to confidently assign to a single
genus. Most often the presence of a sulcus and torn pseudocardinal teeth with curved lateral teeth
prevented confident identification.
This tribe is under current morphological and genetic investigation. While both Fusconaia and
Pleurobema are monophyletic (meaning they belong to separate clades genetically; Inoue et al.
2018), the Fusconaia species within the Trinity River are morphologically indistinguishable
(Pieri et al. 2018).
Genus: Fusconaia spp.
The Trinity River possibly contains three Fusconaia species: F. askewi, F. chunii, and F. flava.
Shells produced by this genus vary from being triangular with high beaks to very quadrate shells
with low beaks. Species were identified to this taxon by the presence of a sulcus to the anterior
of the posterior ridge. The pseudocardinal teeth are triangular and torn, meaning they exhibit
deep ridges within the teeth and are often divergent compared to Pluerobema ridelli specimen.
The lateral teeth of this genus are often straight with a narrow interdentum. This genus is most
abundant in headwater streams with sand/gravel substrates.

Genus: Pleurobema
Species: Pleurobema ridelli
These shells of this species are triangular to sub-quadrate and are moderately thick. They often
contain an inflated beak that is above the hinge line. The posterior ridge is not proceeded by a
sulcus. The psuedocardinal teeth are triangular and moderate. The lateral teeth can be curved and
are separated from the psuedocardinal teeth with a wide interdentum. This species occurs in
small rivers and prefers sand/gravel substrate.
Tribe: Lampsilini
Genus: Lampsilis
Shells identified to this group had small, compressed teeth. Shells are light and fragile;
preservation is often low for these species. This genus tends to produce inflated shell which can
aid identification.
Species: Lampsilis hydiana
Lampsilis hydiana have elliptical to oval and moderately inflated shells. They have diagnostic
beaks that are above the hinge line, but not as high as L. satura. Psuedocardinal teeth are
compressed and triangular, often larger than those of L. teres. This species is often found in
shallow waters of rivers, with mud and sand substrate.
Species: Lampsilis satura
Lampsilis satura have very inflated, oval shells that are fragile. The beak is above of the hinge
line and is very inflated. They have a very deep, inflated beak that contains muscle scars within
the umbo cavity. The psuedocardinal teeth are generally compressed and triangular. This species
is typically found in rivers with low velocity water. This species has not been found within the
basin since the earliest surveys in 1920s (Wolverton et al. 2016).

Mercado Site (41TR203)

357

July 2019

Species: Lampsilis teres
Lampsilis teres produce oblong shells that are generally more elongate than L. hydiana and with
psuedocardinal teeth that are the thinnest of the Lampsilis genus. Shells are not very dense, but
exhibit moderate sphericity and thus have low preservation potential. These species occur in both
rivers and streams and is intolerant of droughts.
Genus: Obliquaria
Species: Obliquaria reflexa
Obliiquaria reflexaâs shell is round and inflated; it contains distinctive knob-sculpturing that are
in the middle of the shell and alternate between the right and left shells. The beak is barely over
the hinge line and the umbo is not inflated. The psuedocardinal teeth are moderately large and
strong. This species occurs in streams, rivers, and lakes with no obvious substrate preference.
Genus: Plectomerus
Species: Plectomerus dombeyanus
Plectomerus dombeyanus produce rectangular shells that are compressed and moderately thick.
These shells have a distinctive angle between the posterior and ventral margin that helps
differentiate it from M. nervosa. This species has a strong posterior ridge and irregular, ridged
sculpturing along the margin of the shell. The beak does not surpass the hinge line. The
psuedocardinal teeth of this species are heavy and divergent. On the right valve, the
psuedocardinal tooth points towards the junction of the anterior and ventral margin (straight
down). This species occurs in streams, rivers, and lakes, with no known water velocity or
substrate preferences.

Mercado Site (41TR203)

358

July 2019

Genus: Potamilus
Species: Potamilus purpuratus
This Lampsilini species creates an inflated, ovoid shell with variable shell density. The shell
exhibits no sculpturing, and the beak is inflated above the hinge line. This shell can have a
moderate posterior wing and the anterior and posterior margins are notably unequal. The
psuedocardinal teeth are moderate in size and are compressed. In some individuals
psuedocardinal teeth can be flipped towards the umbo and slightly torn. This species is found in
streams, rivers, and lakes. Potamilus purpuratus is tolerant of low water quality.
Genus: Truncilla
This grouping is used for specimen that exhibited the posterior ridge of the Truncilla genus but
could not be identified at the species level.
Species: Truncilla donciformes
Truncilla donciformes creates a suboval to elliptical shell with the distinctive Truncilla posterior
ridge. The psuedocardinal teeth are larger than other Lampsilines and are distinct. This species
can be differentiated from T. truncata with its more quadrate shape, thinner shell, and less severe
posterior ridge. This species is mostly found in large rivers and prefers mud, sand, and gravel
substrates. It can often be found in deeper areas of the river in slow to moderate water velocity.
Species: Truncilla truncate
This species creates an inflated triangular shell with a very distinctive posterior ridge. While
there is no sculpturing on this shell, the posterior ridge is sharp and almost turns over on itself.
The beak is above the hinge line and the umbo is inflated. The psuedocardinal teeth are strong,
divergent, and triangular. This species is often found in stream and rivers. They prefer moderate
flows and sand/gravel substrates.

Tribe: Quadrulini
This tribe can be identified by their quadrate shape and triangular psuedocardinal teeth. On the
left valve, the psuedocardinal tooth closest to the anterior margin is larger and taller than the
other psuedocardinal tooth.
Genus: Cyclonaias
Species: Cyclonaias mortoni
Cyclonaias mortoni produces a subquadrate shell that is moderately thick. While not every
specimen contains sculpting, the presence of irregular pustules on the shell is indicative of this
taxonâs shell. The beak can be above the hinge line and the psuedocardinal teeth are typical of
the Quadrulini tribe. These psuedocardinal teeth tend to be curvier than other Quadrulini species.
The lateral teeth are short compared to species in the Plueroblemini tribe. This species occurs in
streams and rivers, typically in gravel substrate and moderate flows.
Genus: Megalonaias
Species: Megalonais nervosa
This species produces shell that is quadrate to rectangular and compressed. The beak is narrow
and barely above the hinge line, distinguishing it from A. plicata. The psuedocardinal teeth are
massive, triangular, and rough. The right psuedocardinal teeth points toward the middle of the
ventral margin. This taxonâs shell has crosshatching near the umbo and ridges near the posterior
margin. This mussel tends to live in rivers with moderate flow and gravel substrates.
Genus: Quadrula
Species: Quadrula apiculate
This species is ovoid to triangular and variable compression. The beak is above the hinge line
and is only moderately inflated. This species has distinctive sculpturing: pustules cover the shell
in a regular pattern. The psuedocardinal teeth are moderately large and very triangular, helping
Mercado Site (41TR203)

July 2019

distinguish it from C. mortoni. The anterior psuedocardinal tooth on the left valve is often larger,
distinguishing it from other triangular shells. This species is tolerant of low water quality and can
be found in rivers, lakes and reservoirs on sandy substrates
Genus: Tritigonia
Species: Tritigonia verrucose
This species of mussel creates a compressed, ellipsoid to rectangular shell with distinctive
sculpturing. The shell has a strong posterior ridge and is entirely covered with sculpturing; the
posterior margin of the shell has a fluted, wavy edge. The psuedocardinal teeth are large and
triangular; the left valveâs teeth generally complete two sides of an equilateral triangle. The
umbo is very shallow and barely reaches over the hinge line. The shell also has strong beak
sculpturing, making it easier to distinguish from P. dombeyanus. This species is found within
streams, rivers, and reservoirs on a variety of substrates. These species are known to lay on the
surface of the substrate during the summer season and prefer oxygen-rich riffles (Howells 2013).
Class: Gastropoda
Group PH
Gastropod shells that exhibited conical shapes were identified to this grouping.
Group PL
Gastropod shells that did not exhibit much variation in the z axis (i.e., the entire coil was flat)
were identified to this grouping; might belong to the family Planorbidae.

CHAPTER 11 â PLANT REMAINS

By: Leslie Bush
Forty-two flotation samples from the Mercado site (41TR203) were submitted for identification
and analysis of plant remains. Thirty-five flotation samples were 2.0 cubic decimeters (cu dm)
(âlitersâ) each; seven samples were smaller, ranging from 1.0 to 1.9 liters (Table 11.1). In total,
78.9 cu dm of soil matrix were processed and analyzed for plant macroremains.

11.1

Site Setting

The majority of the Mercado site is located on the floodplain of the West Fork of the Trinity
River west of I-35W. Vegetation in the site area is currently a mowed field, but a much more
diverse floodplain would have been present prior to channelization of the Trinity River. Not
surprisingly, plants of riparian zones tend to tolerate flooding and other disturbances better than
their upland counterparts. Many species may share the canopy in a floodplain forest, and
âdominance is absent or poorly definedâ (Lee 1945:163). Common trees of floodplains in the
Trinity River area include elms (Ulmus spp.), hackberries (Celtis spp.), green ash (Fraxinus
pennsylvanica spp.), various types of oaks (Quercus spp.), pecan (Carya illinoinensis), and
roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii) (Bezanson 2000:115, 124). Riverbank trees are

Mercado Site (41TR203)

363

July 2019

typically willows (Salix spp.), cottonwood (Populus deltoides), sycamore (Platanus
occidentalis), and boxelder (Acer negundo) (Bezanson 2000:115, 124). Wild onions (Allium
spp.) and camas (Camassia scilloides) are riverbank species that produce edible bulbs.
Floodplains and riverbanks also support useful vines such as grapes (Vitis spp.) and Virginia
creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia). Oxbows, sloughs, marshes, and other wetlands associated
with the Trinity River would have offered plant resources, such as cattail (Typha spp.), and
aquatic tubers or rhizomes, including arrowhead (Sagittaria spp.) and spatterdock (Nuphar
lutea).
Upland vegetation would have been very different from riparian vegetation in prehistoric times,
as it is today. Tarrant County lies in the Fort Worth Prairie section of the Cross Timbers and
Prairies vegetation area, where upland vegetation protected from modern human impacts is a
mixed-grass prairie characterized by grasses such as little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparius),
Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula) and forbs
(Bezanson 2000:115-116, 125; Diggs et al. 1999:52-53).
Mean annual precipitation in Tarrant County during the period 1951 to 1980 was 31.3 in
(795 mm). Precipitation has a unimodal distribution, peaking in April and May followed by a dry
summer. The frost-free season in Tarrant County today averages 230 days and runs from March
26 through November 11 (NFIC 1987:465-466).
11.2

Methods

Flotation samples for this project were processed in 2017 (32 samples) and November 2018
(10 samples) in a modified version of the TAS Field School method (Bush 2012, 2013). The
manual flotation used heavy fraction mesh with square openings of 1.0 mm and light fraction
mesh with triangular openings of 0.3 by 0.4 by 0.5 mm. One hundred carbonized poppy seeds
(Papaver somniferum) were added to three of the flotation samples processed in 2017 to assess
small seed recovery rates (Wagner 1982). Poppy seeds are used because they are readily
available, not native to the study area, and at about 1.0 mm long they approximate the size of
many wild seeds in North America. In the laboratory, 81, 90, and 95 seeds were recovered, for an

Mercado Site (41TR203)

364

July 2019

average recovery of 88.7 seeds in the 2017 samples. This is slightly higher than the recovery rate
of 87.0 for samples from the Mercado site processed in 2013 and comparable to recovery rates
reported for the Incinerator (Sunwatch) Machine using 0.59 mm bottom mesh (Wagner 1982),
the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) manual system using 0.5 mm bottom mesh
(Hunter and Gassner 1998), and the Flot-Tech Machine at Indiana University using 1.0 mm
bottom mesh (Bush 2001). Recovery rates for this Project are well above rates reported for IDOT
projects and the Incinerator Machine with 1.0 bottom mesh (Wagner 1982). Recovery rates in the
90s have been occasionally reported for manual flotation systems (Bush 2013) and machines
with 0.6 mm bottom mesh (Bush 2001, 2013; Hunter and Gassner 1998).
Plant material from the light fractions was transferred in March 2017 (32 samples from feature
contexts) and November 2018 (10 samples, 8 from non-feature contexts, and 2 from Feature 10)
to Macrobotanical Analysis, where sorting and analysis took place in April and May 2017, and
November and December 2018. The flotation samples were sorted according to standard
procedures (Pearsall 2000). Light fractions were weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200 by 0.01-g
electronic balance before being size-sorted through a stack of graduated geologic mesh.
Carbonized botanical materials that did not pass through the No. 10 mesh (2 mm square
openings) were completely sorted, counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized plant
parts and non-botanical material in this size fraction consisted of rootlets, grass leaves and stems,
gastropods, mussel shell, and bone fragments. It was weighed and bagged but not further sorted.
Materials that fell through the 2 mm mesh (âresidueâ) were examined under a stereoscopic
microscope at 7-45 X magnification (2017 samples) or 6-55 X magnification (2018 samples) for
carbonized botanical remains other those present in the larger size fraction. Identifiable material
was removed from residue, counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized seeds in the
light fraction were identified and recorded on a presence/absence basis on laboratory forms.
Examined residue smaller than 2 mm was weighted, recorded, and labeled only.
For each flotation sample, wood charcoal fragments were selected at random from those larger
than 2 mm until 20 fragments were examined, or all fragments were examined in cases where
fewer than 20 were present. When fewer than 20 wood charcoal fragments were present in the

Mercado Site (41TR203)

365

July 2019

larger size fraction, additional identification was attempted for successively smaller pieces until
identification could not be made beyond the division level (âhardwoodâ) or until identification
had been attempted for 20 fragments. Fragments were snapped to reveal a clean transverse
section and examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 28-180 X magnification. When
necessary, tangential or radial sections were examined for ray seriation, presence of spiral
thickenings, types and sizes of intervessel pitting, and other minute characteristics.
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison to
materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of standard
reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; Martin and Barkley 2000;
Musil 1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980; Wheeler 2011). Plant nomenclature follows the
PLANTS Database (NRCS 2018).

Uncarbonized Plant Remains

Most uncarbonized plant parts at the Mercado site appear in the form of rootlets and grass stems
that are clearly related to the modern vegetation at the site. Uncarbonized seeds are a common
occurrence on most archeological sites, but they usually represent seeds of modern plants that
have made their way into the soil either through their own dispersal mechanisms or by
faunalturbation, floralturbation, or argilliturbation (Bryant 1985:51-52; Miksicek 1987:231-232).
In all except the driest areas of North America, uncarbonized plant material on open-air sites can
be assumed to be of modern origin unless compelling evidence suggests otherwise (Lopinot and
Brussell 1982; Miksicek 1987:231). The seeds at the Mercado site consist primarily of grasses
and weedy annuals relating to the current vegetation and recent disturbances on the site. All
uncarbonized plant parts, including seeds, are interpreted here as modern.

Analytic Unit 1 (Feature 10)

AUs 1 through 3 date to the Late Prehistoric. Four samples from Feature 10, a burned rock
midden, were analyzed from AU 1 (Tables 11.4 and 11.5). At 0.20 g/cu. dm., density of plant
material was relatively high in this feature (site average for all contexts was 0.06 g/cu. dm.; nonMercado Site (41TR203)

369

July 2019

feature contexts in AU 1 were 0.02 g/cu. dm.). With Feature 26 (AU 4), Feature 10 was one of
two features where a bulb scale fragment was recovered, indicating that bulbs such as wild onion
or camas were exposed to fire (i.e., cooked) during this occupation. Oak wood charcoal is
frequently associated with burned rock cooking since oak burns hot and produces excellent coals
(Collier and Turner 1981; Marcouiller and Anderson n.d.). Interestingly, oak wood charcoal was
not common in Feature 10, represented by only 4 of 74 identifiable fragments. Other, more
common, woods in the feature include elm, blackhaw, and plum/cherry. Elm trees (certainly
American elm and probably cedar elm) are important for producing large sheets of bark for
baskets or roofing material wood for lodge construction and wooden mortars (Gilmore 1934).
Blackhaw, a shrub, produces straight shoots that are useful for making arrows. Oak was better
represented in the two samples taken from outside feature context in AU 1, where 7 of 11
identifiable wood charcoal fragments were oak. It is possible the elm and blackhaw wood
charcoal in Feature 10 represents convenient disposal of craft materials and associated debris by
fire.

Analytic Unit 2 (Feature 12)

Feature 12, a hearth of burned limestone cobbles, was the only feature analyzed from AU 2
(Tables 11.6 and 11.7). It yielded 11 wood charcoal fragments sufficiently large for
identification, of which five could be identified as white group oak; the others were also oak but
could not be further classified. Botanical density was 0.025 g/cu. dm.

Analytic Unit 3 (Feature 13)

This AU was characterized by small hearth features and faunal material, including white tailed
deer bone. Carbonized plant remains in Feature 13 consisted only of wood charcoal (Tables 11.8
and 11.9). Four fragments were large enough for identification. Two were oak and two were elm.
Botanical density was 0.02 g/cu. dm.

Analytic Unit 4 (Features 21 and 25 through 28)

AUs 4 and 5 are Transitional Archaic. All features in AU 4 were shell middens except for
Feature 27, a pit feature. Feature 26, one of the mussel shell middens, contained more non-wood
remains than any other feature analyzed in this or previous investigations at the site (Tables
11.10 and 11.11). Non-wood remains consisted of a bulb scale fragment, four acorn nutshell
fragments, eleven acorn cap fragments, three goosefoot seeds, and a stick-tight seed. The acorn
parts recovered are not directly edible, but acorn nutmeats provide starch and fat once the
astringent tannins have been leached from the meats or flour (Ortiz and Parker 1991:95-108).

The goosefoot seeds recovered from Feature 26 are thick-coated, wild forms. The seeds,
flowerheads, and greens of goosefoot are edible. Goosefoot is in the same botanical family as
beets and spinach (Chenopodiaceae), and its greens are similar. The immature, edible
flowerheads of goosefoot (âhuauzontleâ) have been compared to broccoli (Glore 2006:57). The
stick-tight âseedâ from Feature 26 is the remains of a bur with few recorded economic uses
(Moerman 1998). It was likely disposed of by fire immediately after being plucked from human
clothing or the fur of a dog or game animal. Stick-tight is common in riparian areas of Texas in
the spring (February through May), with fruits available March through May (Diggs 2006:962-

966). All 20 wood charcoal specimens examined for Feature 26 could be identified as some type
of oak, with both white group oak (n = 14) and red group oak (n = 2) present.
Other features in Analytic Unit 4 contained only wood charcoal and indeterminable carbonized
remains (Tables 11.10 and 11.11). Three wood taxa could be identified in Feature 28, including
hickory/pecan, elm, and a legume (probably honeylocust or redbud). The other three features
contained only one identifiable wood type each. Oak was present in Features 21 and 25, and elm
was present in Feature 27.
Macrobotanical remains in these features were generally sparse, with an average 0.043 g/cu. dm.
When the non-feature flotation samples from this AU are included, the density drops to 0.037
g/cu. dm.
11.10 Analytic Unit 5 (Features 14 through 17 and 31)
Average botanical density in AU 5 features is identical to that of AU 4 at 0.032 g/cu. dm. One
bedstraw seed was recovered from Feature 16. Otherwise all remains consisted of wood charcoal
(Tables 11.12 and 11.13). Oak was present in Features 16 and 17. Feature 17 also included elm.
Wood charcoal in other features consisted of plum/cherry (Feature 31), ash and redbud
(Feature 14), and boxelder and legume (Feature 15).

11.11 Analytic Unit 6 (Features 18, 19, and 30)
AUs 6 through 8 are Late Archaic occupations comprising a sheet midden with abundant mussel
shell, burned rock, lithics, burned clay, and faunal material, including bison. Botanical density in
AU 6 is low, 0.02 g/cu dm. With the exception of three bark fragments from Feature 19, all
botanical remains are wood charcoal (Tables 11.14 and 11.15). Identifiable wood in Feature 19
wood consisted of a single fragment of blackhaw. Feature 30 yielded oaks (red group and white
group) and an unidentifiable diffuse porous wood fragment that is not consistent with oak. Cedar
elm was the only identifiable wood charcoal in Feature 18.

11.12 Analytic Unit 7 (Features 29, 32 through 36, 28 through 41, and 43 through 44)
Botanical density in feature contexts averaged 0.070 g/cu dm. in AU 7, and non-feature contexts
averaged 0.015 g/cu dm. The only non-wood plant part recovered was a grass stem fragment
from Feature 43 (Tables 11.16 and 11.17).
Plum/cherry (genus Prunus) was the most common type of wood in AU 7, largely because of
19 fragments in Feature 41 where it was the only wood type identified. Feature 41 was a dense
concentration of artifacts and burned earth. Plum/cherry wood charcoal was present in smaller
numbers in an additional 6 features from AU 7: Features 29, 32, 38, 39, 40, and 43 (hearths) and
Feature 34 (a pit). Mexican plum (Prunus mexicana) is the most common member of the genus
Prunus in north-central Texas today, and it grows well in river bottoms (Simpson 1999:250).
Mexican plum does not sprout from rhizomes, however, so it appears as single stems in riparian
woodlands and other situations in which it grows (Correll and Johnson 1970:759; Diggs et al.
1999:949; Simpson 1999:250). The larger, thicket-forming black cherry (Prunus serotina) is
another candidate for the abundant Prunus wood charcoal in AU 6. Although this species is not
attested by herbarium specimens for Tarrant County today, it is recorded for Dallas County
(Diggs et. al 1999:950), and black cherry has been known to extend its range along streambeds
(Simpson 1999:254).
After plum/cherry, oaks were the next most common wood type in AU 7, with 29 oak fragments
identified from 7 features and 1 non-feature context. Eighteen boxelder fragments were
recovered from Feature 43, but it was not recovered elsewhere in AU 7. Other woods identified
in AU 7 consisted of hickory/pecan, ash, legume, and blackhaw.

Carbonized plant remains in AU 8 consisted of wood charcoal (all contexts) and a carbonized
root fragment from a non-feature context (Tables 11.18 and 11.19). Woods identified were
plum/cherry and oak. Features 20 and 24 yielded both oak and plum/cherry woods while the
third feature analyzed from the AU, Feature 42, produced only oak. Outside feature context, one
sample had plum/cherry and one oak. Botanical density was 0.063 g/cu. dm. for feature contexts
and 0.045 g/cu. dm. for non-feature contexts.

11.14 Non-Feature Contexts
Carbonized plant remains in non-feature contexts were sparse and consisted only of wood
charcoal and a woody root fragment (Tables 11.20 and 11.21). Site-wide, average botanical
density for non-feature contexts was 0.02 g/cu. dm. as compared to 0.07 g/cu. dm. for feature
contexts. Wood taxa present in non-feature contexts generally reflected woods found in feature
context for that AU. Only in AU 4 did a non-feature sample yield plant types not found in feature
context in that AU: Lot 58 yielded one fragment of blackhaw wood charcoal and one of juniper.
Other blackhaw specimens were found in AUs 1, 6, and 7.

11.15 Wood Charcoal as an Environmental Indicator
Wood collection for fuel is a cultural activity governed by cultural rules (e.g., preference for
particular fuels in particular circumstances [Metzger and Williams 1966], particular areas of the
landscape favored or avoided for fuel collection [Dufraisse 2008]). In wood charcoal
assemblages, restrictions on particular species or collecting locations may result in the absence of
particular types of woods (Metzger and Williams 1966). Nonetheless, the steady demand for
such heavy, bulky material as fuelwood, combined with criteria for âgoodâ fuelwood that
frequently emphasizes dryness and diameter over species usually results in a wood charcoal
assemblage that reflects trees available in the local environment (Allevato et al. 2012; Asch and
Asch 1986; Shackelton and Prins 1992; Smart and Hoffman 1988). At the Mercado site, the
wood charcoal reflects a floodplain environment, as evidenced by the presence of tree types that
are found primarily along watercourses such as boxelder, plum/cherry, and ash. Floodplains
associated with trunk streams, which experience longer periods of inundation, tend to have a
slightly different species composition than floodplains of tributary streams or ravines (Table
11.22). The overall taxa composition of wood charcoal at the Mercado site is more like the larger
streams than tributary streams or ravines in the region. Hackberry, mulberry, and soapberry, trees
that are common on smaller streams and ravines, are absent from the assemblage, and white
group oak is more common than red group. Hackberry mulberry, and soapberry have many
documented uses among historic Native Americans, none of which suggest particular spiritual
power that would result in avoidance of their wood for fuel (Moerman 1998). A local understory
including the smaller trees redbud, dogwood, and Mexican plum or black cherry and blackhaw is
also indicated.

11.16 Summary
Archeological plant remains from the Mercado site consisted of primarily of wood charcoal. The
wood taxa composition is consistent with the floodplain forest of a major stream channel such as
the Trinity River. Bulb scale fragments were found in Feature 10 (Late Prehistoric) and Feature
26 (Transitional Archaic), indicating exploitation of bulb plants such as onion and camas that
would have grown in the immediate site area. Feature 26 also produced acorn and goosefoot.

CHAPTER 12 â FIRE-CRACKED ROCK ANALYSIS

By: Richard Thompson Stark
12.1

Introduction

Analysis of FCR from site 41TR203, the Mercado site, is helpful in understanding the specific
functions of associated features as well as more general trends in subsistence strategies utilized at
this locale from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods. Patterns of commonality and
difference in archeologically recovered FCR describe the re-use of this specific locale for earth
ovens and open hearths from 2740 to 930 yr Cal BP. Beyond the analysis and interpretations
herein, this research may be used to generate ideas for other potentially useful archeological
analyses, or experimental designs, and to establish commonality in protocols for FCR sampling,
terminology, and curation. This chapter defines key terms, methodology and results of analysis
of approximately 690 fragments of archeologically recovered FCR from 41TR203. Parameters of
analysis include descriptions of rock type(s), size, colors, fracture patterning, cumulative
weights, and density distributions. This FCR analysis is feature-focused, in that FCR is discussed
in the context of an associated feature, or associated AU for isolates.
12.1.1

Caveats and Context

While lipid analysis was not conducted on FCR surfaces, the presence/absence of residues and
vugginess was noted and samples with indications of potentially fruitful lipid analysis were
curated for future analysis. The presence of vugs presents ideal contexts for the preservation of
material directly related to the feature use and FCR production. Any subsequent lipid analysis of
the FCR fragments from site 41TR203 must consider that the source of residues may be from
fuels, organic packing material, secondary taphonomic processes, or foods. In some cases,
determining if encountered FCR is the result of cultural or natural process can be problematic,
however this does not appear to be the case at 41TR203, and FCR here are assumed to be
culturally derived. FCR produced in non-food processing contexts, such as for sweat baths,
ceramic and lime kilns, and sacred rituals is beyond the scope of this research, as all FCR
recovered from 41TR203 is assumed to be related to food production.
FCR exists as a commonly encountered archeological material with exceptional research
potential. While Texas archaeologist have been describing and sampling FCR from middens and
Mercado Site (41TR203)

391

hearth features for over 100 years, FCR sampling and analysis remains unstandardized, with
incipient interpretive potential (Hester 1991). This research is situated with appreciation of the
volumes of previous FCR research, and within the incipient hopeful potentials, which stimulate
further rigorous sampling with creative and comprehensive analyses. Ethnographic evidence
indicates that FCR utilized for food processing may be produced in a variety of feature types,
including open hearths and earth ovens. Middle Range Theory and specifically ethnographic
analogy is used here as an interpretive model building device to frame questions and ideas about
archeological recovered materials, not serve as a direct analogy for the archeological record.
Similarly, the accretion models and statistical analyses are to be utilized to magnify the data, for
context and the generation of ideas and questions.
12.1.2

Definitions

Hearth: The place where the fire and its combustion related components rests; archeologically
visible as charcoal, scorched earth, and/or thermal elements. Although hearths are defined here
as the surface upon which a fire is built, they may or may not include stone thermal elements.
The nature and quantity of thermal elements in a hearth feature is indicative of the intensity (i.e.,
time, temperature) of the desired cooking environment. FCR fractures found within hearths are
diagnostic to the general heating and cooling histories that they experience.
Open hearths create a roasting/drying cooking environment. Any fuel added resides
stratigraphically above stone thermal elements and the original fuel used to heat the thermal
elements burns to ash. While open hearths vary, they imply an informal social setting of daily
mundane food rituals. Open hearths, which present a dry/roasting cooking environment are
observed ethnographically as site nuclei, with human behavior and artifacts discard in
predictable patterns surrounding open hearths. Open hearths are also observed to heat stone
boiling elements and as ancillary to earth ovens, used for expedient food preparation during the
construction and use of an earth oven. That is, smaller ancillary hearth features are expected
immediately adjacent to earth oven hearths, representing the preparation or re-heating of food
consumed by the earth oven specialists themselves, on site, as opposed to the food prepared in
the earth oven, which is consumed by the extended group in a different social setting.
Archeological signatures of open hearths include roasting platforms of FCR and ash on

Mercado Site (41TR203)

392

July 2019

unprepared ground and FCR features with shallow to flat basins. Unless extinguished, fuels in
open hearths tend to burn to ash, with limited charcoal remaining.
Earth Oven: A closed hearth feature utilizing radiant heat in a moist environment. Components
of earth ovens include a hearth, thermal elements, and some form of lid/cap to retain the heat,
making the combustion environment oxygen-reduced. Earth ovens exist as hearths with earthen
or organic lids and utilize layers of moist organic packing material to produce a steamy slowcook environment. Maintaining prolonged food temperatures hovering near 100 degrees
Centigrade requires high initial temperatures of the thermal elements as well as water in the
packing material. In earth ovens radiant heat from the thermal elements is sealed by an earthen/
organic lid, providing heat convection throughout the oven, flowing between the thermal
element, packing material, and food. Earth ovens represent behavior surrounding either bulk
processing of resources or festive food processing, or a combination of both (Stark 2002a). Bulk
processing of food in earth ovens is often seasonal, relating to the time of the year when plants
have stored up their maximum amount of energy or when meat from a nearby kill is butchered,
quartered, and bulk processed in earth ovens bone-in (Brink and Dawe 1989). FCR from earth
ovens exhibit both expansion fractures, from the rapid expansion of the stones during initial
heating events, and contraction fractures which occur as the stones cool slowly.
Earth ovens create oxygen-poor cooking environments, and if hardwoods are used as fuel, then
earth ovens will produce abundant charcoal, typically underneath the FCR. That said, because
earth ovens make use of stored energy in hot rocks, hardwood fuel is not necessary, and
lightweight, fast-burning fuels may be used in earth ovens, thus impacting the amount of
archeologically observed charcoal. Social settings for earth oven use include 1) during a plant
harvest, when subsistence strategies organize around bulk-processing of plants with seasonal
high energy stores; 2) during the preparation of a feast, when an animal is slaughtered for
immediate consumption by an extended family group; 3) in fuel-poor environments, as a means
to maximize fuel resources when a large amount of food is cooked; 4) in fat-poor subsistence
strategies, as a means to render fat throughout animal flesh cooked bone in; and 5) to transform
inedible plant tissues into a nutrient packed edible form (for example, prior to the harvest of ripe
plants to make edible food from hard to digest greens, or during seasonal periods of food scarcity

[i.e., famine] to transform otherwise unused toxic plant tissues into a palatable and nutritious
form) (Wandsnider 1997).
Wandsnider (1997) (Figure 12.1) has identified seven significant trends with earth oven foods:
1) plant tissues are earth oven cooked more often than meat tissues; 2) the plant tissues most
often earth oven cooked are inulin-rich; 3) the meat tissues most often cooked are fat-rich; 4)
meats are earth oven cooked for a short time compared with plant cooking; 5) often, meats are
earth oven cooked for social aggregations and immediate consumption; 6) earth oven cooking
creates food tissues which are then more palatable and nutritious; and 7) earth ovens are often
used to bulk process large amounts of food.

Figure 12.1. Trends in Earth Oven Foods (Adapted from Wandsnider 1997)
Fire-cracked rock middens: FCR middens exist as collections of discarded thermal elements.
FCR middens provide opportunities for lithic sourcing, refit analysis, and accretion modeling,
with implications for interpreting site intensity values, iterations of use, and composite values for
represented food loads. FCR middens relate to hearths in the immediate vicinity and are utilized
for artifact caching. FCR encountered in middens represents patterned discard and is relatable as

Mercado Site (41TR203)

394

discard from specific hearth features. FCR middens accrete as hearth features, which are cleaned
out and prepared for the next use. The exact relationship between FCR midden accretion and
intensity/iterations of hearth use is not clear; however, one observed limestone FCR midden
related to bulk plant processing accretion occurred at approximately 0.125 cmÂ³ per use (Stark
2002b). Differentiation between middens, open hearths, and earth ovens, and isolating the
hearths related to FCR discard is critical to interpreting the associated artifacts of site 41TR203.
Ethnographic evidence indicates social patterns for earth oven use, with each categorical social
setting corresponding to a distinct archeological artifact suite.
Ethnographic observations of FCR discard indicate that it is related to thermal failure,
manifesting in fractures and increased inability to retain heat after re-use. FCR fragmentation is
the result of brittle deformation of the rock structure across natural cleavage and bedding planes.
Cleavage planes are internal surfaces within a stone which are determined by the crystal lattice,
while bedding planes exist as former depositional surfaces within sedimentary rocks. During and
prior to the production of FCR, as rocks are heated in open fires, thermal stresses act upon the
rocks as they are heated for energy transfer to another medium, often food (Jackson 1998; Thoms
1989). The term FCR is applicable to all thermally altered stone, as micro-fissures are present in
stones which have not experienced visually obvious fracturing. Fractures may be described as
meandering, conchoidal (curvilinear), hackly (angular), stepped, and dendritic or branching.
FCR fracture patterns exist in several forms. FCR fractured during the heating process can
exhibit expansion related fracturing which produces fragments with conchoidal/curvilinear
profiles. As the stones inter-granules heat-up and differentially expand at the micro-level,
potentially producing elastic limit failures within the stone, manifesting in the explosion of
curvilinear fragments. FCR fractures which occur as the rocks cool exhibit contraction fractures,
producing hackly joints and polygonal fragments. Contraction fractures follow a model of elastic
limits reached from implosion, similar to the production of mud cracks and perma-frost fissures.
Contraction fractures in FCR are generally associated with stone cooling and could be
precipitated from rapid cooling experienced upon earth oven closure or when hot stones are
placed inside of an animal cavity. Although more research is required, it appears that polygonal
contraction fractures created during slow-cooling differ from stone dissolution resulting from the

Mercado Site (41TR203)

395

July 2019

dendritic curvilinear pattern observed in micro-fissures after water-quenching and immediate
cooling (Stark 2002a).
FCR fractures naturally manifest as a reduction series in halves and thirds, further reducing in
patterns which appear generally similar and yet infinitely different, exhibiting visual tendencies
which are symmetrical, chaotic, or Fibonacci-like. It remains uncertain as to the best statistical
model in which to describe FCR, and particularly how to delineate and describe anomalies in the
data, we examine the fractal dimension here. Many naturally created fractures and fragments
exhibit a fractal dimension, including geological erosional processes and the disaggregation of
coal, gneiss, granite, pumice, sand, and glacial till (Barton 1995; Borodich 1997; Brown 2001;
Turcotte 1997; Turcotte and Huang 1995). Rock fragmentation creates size/frequency fragment
distributions in a fractal (power law) pattern, which obeys the following: N(>r) = rË Í© , where
N(>r) equpals the number of fragments with a long axis greater than r, and d, which measures the
relative abundance of fragments of varying sizes, is the fractal dimension (Brown 2001:620;
2005; Turcotte 1986; 1997). The natural fragmentation of stone produces straight regression
lines of size/frequency distributions, exhibiting a power law or fractal dimension. With this effort
as a baseline, future research may find value in the investigation of patterned anomalisms to the
power law, and how these differences in the expected natural straight-line regressions relate to
patterns of human discard and reuse, secondary taphonomic processes, and archeological
sampling bias.
12.2

Methods of Analysis

This FCR analysis for site 41TR203 is grouped by feature, with the intent to describe the patterns
of details related to groups of thermally fractured stone and situate any interpretive statements
regarding the human actions responsible for these patterns (Table 12.1; Figure 12.2). These
interpreted human actions, represented by data clouds of fragmented FCR, related to inferred
past behavior, and may identify both ancient action and the more recent actions of the
archaeologists, particularly related to sampling bias. Data was analyzed from the following
domains of relevance:
1. Size: longitudinal axis (mm)
2. Weight: scaled measurements (kilo grams)

D= ln (N>r)/ln (r), where D is the fractal dimension, and ln(N>r) is the natural logarithm of
fragments greater in size than r (Brown 2001; 2005). Calculations compliment and acknowledge

Fire-cracked Rock by Feature
Feature 10 Fire-cracked Rock

Feature 10 has the best sample size of the site 41TR203 FCR collection, represented by 426 FCR
fragments collected from a 40 by 120-cm prepared basin. FCR surfaces occasionally include
vugs, and coloration is primarily gray (2.5Y 5/1), with blotches of light red (7.5 R 6/6) and
streaks of red (7.5R 4/8). FCR fragment sizes included 8 fragments less than or equal to 10 mm,
9 fragments less than or equal to 20 mm, 66 fragments less than or equal to 20 mm, 92 fragments
less than or equal to 30mm, 49 fragment less than or equal to 40 mm, 80 fragments less than or
equal to 50 mm, 65 fragments less than or equal to 60 mm, 43 fragments less than or equal to 70
mm, 32 fragments less than or equal to 80 mm, 8 fragments less than or equal to 90 mm, and 3
fragments less than or equal to 100 mm (Photos 12.1 through 12.11).

Feature 10 FCR fragments appear as rectilinear spherical polygons with a micro-topography of
ridges and linear craters. Many of the FCR from Feature 10 include curvilinear flakes scars
which remove cortex on the distal portions of tabular FCR. The curvilinear fractures appear to
have occurred prior to polygonal fractures in Feature 10. These FCR fracture scar signatures
indicate rapid expansion from heating the rocks quickly in a roaring fire followed by implosion
fractures from cooling. This sequence of fractures is consistent with hearth preparation and use
of an earth oven. Micro-charcoal appears clinging to some of the Feature 10 stones, indicating an
oxygen reduced environment consistent with what would be expected from earth oven
combustion matrix. Feature 10 FCR include iron nodules and concretion occurrence in bedding
planes and within vugs (Photos 12.1 through 12.11). While Feature 10 is dominated by limestone
FCR, one FCR fragment from Feature 10 is sandstone, one FCR fragment from Feature 10 is
sandstone. Feature 14, Figure 3 illustrates multi-modality in the size distribution of FCR,
centered upon 30 mm and 50 mm for Feature 10. Although the exact cause(s) for the multiple
peaks in the size distribution analysis is uncertain, our initial interpretation is that it related to
either sampling techniques or a cultural practice of selecting certain size classes of FCR for use
or discard elsewhere. The rapid exponential, fractal, and cumulative regression expressions of
size/frequency distributions are presented for FCR from Feature 10 in Table 12.2. In the Power
Law expression of the fractal dimension, the regression does not follow the expected linear
trajectory of natural rock fragmentation. Anomalies on both ends of the Power Law curve could
represent cultural, taphonomic, and sampling bias. Further interpretation of these results could be
approached through a middle range theoretical approach which reconstructs an analogous FCR
data set mimicking Feature 10 with experimental replication, followed by statistical analysis,
coupled with a review of ethnographic and archeological examples of selective FCR discard.

Feature 12 Fire-cracked Rock

FCR from Feature 12 is comprised of six fragments. FCR surface coloration is primarily gray
(2.5Y 5/1), with blotches of light red (7.5 R 6/6) and adhering black charcoal flecks (Photo
12.12). FCR from Feature 12 is comprised of tabular limestone, with curvilinear and hackly
fractures, and cortex present in all fragments. FCR fragment sizes included two fragments less
than or equal to 50 mm, two fragments less than or equal to 60 mm, and two fragments less than
or equal to 70 mm. No fragment sets appear to refit. While the analysis of Feature 12 is limited
by sample size, the trimodal size distribution may be the result of hearth cleaning, or selected
stones for use within an animal cavity or represent an open hearth. Ancillary hearths are often
located to earth ovens, representing food consumed by the cooks during the construction and use
of the earth oven. The curvilinear and hackly nature of fractures within Feature 12 support this
interpretation, as this type of fracturing is observed to be related to expansion fracturing
manifesting from rapid rock expansion.

Feature 15 Fire-cracked Rock

Analyzed FCR from Feature 15 (which includes all of the FCR from the feature) consists of
24 kg of 94 fragments. FCR surfaces occasionally include vugs and coloration is primarily gray
(2.5Y 5/1), with blotches of light red (7.5 R 6/6). FCR fragment sizes included 4 fragments less
than or equal to 30 mm, 5 fragments less than or equal to 40 mm, 24 fragments less than or equal
to 50 mm, 29 fragments less than or equal to 60 mm, 17 fragments less than or equal to 70 mm,
10 fragments less than or equal to 80 mm, and 5 fragments less than or equal to 90 mm
(Figure 12.5, Photos 12.13-12.16). Fragments appear as rectilinear spherical polygons with a
micro-topography of ridges and linear craters. Size distribution for Feature 15 FCR generally
follows a bell curve centered upon 60 mm. Statistical analysis indicates the rapid exponential,
fractal, and cumulative regression expressions of size/frequency distributions for FCR from
Feature 15 (Table 12.3). In the Power Law expression of the fractal dimension, the regression
does not follow the expected linear trajectory of natural rock fragmentation; however, the
isolation and elimination of select variables produced a highly liner power law regression. The
nature of FCR fragmentation suggests that Feature 15 may represent an intact FCR collection of
an earth oven hearth. This hypothesis could be tested through experimental replication.

Feature 16 Fire-cracked Rock

Feature 16 is represented by three FCR collected from a 50-cm diameter prepared basin
(Figures 22 and 23). No cortex is present and the fragments do not appear to re-fit. FCR surface
coloration is primarily gray (2.5Y 5/1), with some adhering charcoal flecks. The FCR fragments
recovered in Feature 16 are multi-sided polygons, with linear fractures suggesting implosion and
contraction. While interpretation of Feature 16 is limited by sample size, fracture patterns
suggest a contraction consistent with slow cooling in an earth oven. If this FCR accumulation
represents anything more than random discard, the isolated nature of Feature 16 FCR may
indicate a special purpose, such a use within an animal cavity, or possibly as a small isolated and
out of the way accumulation around the temporary shelter posts. Use as prop stones is not ruled
out; however, we would expect more curvilinear fracturing for limestone FCR created in an
open-hearth environment.

Feature 18 Fire-cracked Rock

Feature 18 is represented by 16 FCR, with size distributions ranging in size from 30 mm to 70
mm (Figures 24 through 26). Cortex is present on some samples and one set of FCR refit. FCR
surface coloration is primarily gray (2.5Y 5/1), with some adhering charcoal flecks. The
fragments are multi-sided and tabular polygons, with some curvilinear fracture scars present.
Curvilinear fracturing can occur during rock expansion as the limestone is heated and expands
beyond its elastic limit, it does so in curves. The inclusion of both curvilinear scaring and linear
polygonal fracturing suggests that the limestones were heated in a very hot fire and then cooled
slowly, producing both types of fracturing in the collection. Fracture patterning and size
distribution analysis suggest that Feature 18 FCR was created from both explosion during
expansion and an implosion during contraction, consistent with fracturing in an earth oven
environment.

Feature 19 Fire-cracked Rock

Feature 19 is represented by a collection of seven FCR (Photo 12.20), burnt earth, charcoal, and
shell 35 cm diameter. FCR fragment sizes included three fragments less than or equal to 1 cm,
two fragments less than or equal to 6 cm, and two fragments less than or equal to 7 cm
(Figure 12.8). Coloration is primarily gray (2.5Y 5/1), with blotches of light red (7.5 R 6/6). The
fragments appear as roughly cubic polygons, some with cortex. The fragmentation on the FCR
from Feature 19 is consistent with contraction fracturing through implosion, suggesting an earth
oven environment. While the fragments do not appear to refit, it is probable that the smallest
fragments derived from the two other parent FCR, and that the size distribution bimodal variance
may represent post-depositional weathering of micro-fissures set up during heating, or some
cultural practice which would encourage micro-fragmentation.

Feature 20.1 Fire-cracked Rock

Feature 20.1 is represented by a collection of approximately 90 limestone FCR fragments.
Coloration is primarily gray (2.5Y 5/1), with blotches of light red (7.5 R 6/6). Several fragment
sets refit in meandering, angular fractures which appear to overly curvilinear fractures. The FCR
of Feature 20.1 are both tabular, with curvilinear expansion fractures and hackly/angular
fractures producing polygons (Photos 12.21 through 12.23). Some cortex is present. Feature 20.1
includes FCR fragments, with fracturing consistent with both rapid expansion and subsequent
contraction cooling.

Three fragments from Feature 20.1 refit in arcs which transverse the entire face of the stone,
meandering as hackly, angular fractures which divide a tabular stone in thirds (Photo 12.24). A
curvilinear expansion fracture scar extends along the distal face of each of these three fragments,
which refit and thus, pre-dates them. The stones appear to have experienced an explosive
fracturing upon heating and subsequent contraction fragmentation occurred upon cooling. Other
fragments appear as rectilinear spherical polygons with a micro-topography of ridges and linear
craters. The linear craters contain deep meandering troughs at the location of the original microfissures within the deep fabric of the stone. Coupled with FCR refit analysis, FCR reduction scar
descriptions and the interpreted sequencing of this type of prehistoric lithic reduction provides a
potentially fruitful avenue for further research.

Feature 30 is represented by a collection of 24 limestone FCR fragments, bison, and shell, from a
prepared basin, 50 cm in diameter. FCR fragment sizes included three fragments less than or
equal to 10 mm, nine fragments less than or equal to 20 mm, and five fragments less than or
equal to 30 mm (Figure 12.10). Feature 30 FCR appears as two or three stones which have
broken in half, and those halves have broken in half again, etc. Two fragment sets refit in
meandering, angular fractures. The fragments appear as rectilinear spherical polygons with a
micro-topography of ridges and linear craters (Photo 12.27). The linear craters contain deep
meandering troughs at the location of the original micro-fissures within the deep fabric of the
stone. These meandering joints intersect in roughly perpendicular confluences of primary, or
original, troughs with secondary fissures (Photo 12.28). Three of the fragments include the
invertebrate fossils bivalves Gryphaea navia, and Inoceramus sp from the Kimamitia, Fort
Worth, or Duck Creek limestone formations (Photo 12.29). Cortex is present on some examples,
and the general FCR surface coloration is primarily gray (2.5Y 5/1), with blotches of light red
(7.5 R 6/6). Anomalies on both ends of the Power Law curve are naturally inexplicable and could
represent cultural, taphonomic, and sampling bias (Table 12.5).

Feature 35 is represented by a collection of seven limestone FCR fragments collected from a ring
within a prepared basin, 50 cm in diameter. FCR fragment sizes included five fragments less

equal to 70 mm (Figure 12.11, Photo 12.30). Feature 30 FCR appears as rectilinear spherical
polygons created from contraction fractures, with no cortex visible.
While the fractures appear consistent within a slowly a reducing temperature environment in an
earth oven, the isolated nature of Feature 35 and mono-modal size distribution suggests
intentional selection for a specific culinary task. Lipid analysis may be helpful in future research
to facilitate interpretations of isolated small and mono-modal clusters of FCR such as Feature 35.

Feature 42 is represented by a collection of 42 limestone FCR fragments. FCR fragment sizes
included six fragments less than or equal to 30 mm, five fragments less than or equal to 40 mm,
four fragments less than or equal to 50 mm, seven fragments less than or equal to 60 mm, eight
fragments less than or equal to 70 mm, ten fragments less than or equal to 80 mm, and two
fragments measured less than or equal to 100 mm (Figure 12.12). The bi-modal FCR size
distribution may indicate multiple firings, a hypothesis which could be tested through
experimental replication of Feature 42. Statistical analysis indicates the rapid exponential,
fractal, and cumulative regression expressions of size/frequency distributions for FCR from
Feature 42 (Table 12.6). While the Power Law expression does not follow the expected linear
trajectory of natural rock fragmentation, the removal of anomalies on both ends of the Power
Law curve would better model the natural fracturing of stone. The anomalies could represent
cultural selection such as discard and re-use, error from secondary taphonomic processes, and/or
sampling bias. FCR from Feature 42 appears as rectilinear spherical polygons created from
contraction fractures consistent with an earth oven environment, and may represent an intact
earth oven hearth, used multiple times.

Summary and Conclusions

Archeological sampling at site 41TR203 included all observed thermally altered rocks, which
were catalogued by lot, feature, and analytical unit. The FCR was weighed, measured and
counted by lot number. Eight rock features were sorted by size, with sizes ranges from 1 to 10
cm at the long axis. Data from natural rock fracture produce linear regression lines within the
fractal dimension of their size/frequency distributions (Figures 12.13 through 12.15). Patterned
data from defined FCR parameters for specific features at site 41TR203 indicate anomalies, and
the probable interplay between sampling bias, discard patterns, and selective re-use of FCR for
particular culinary tasks. Fracture patterns consistent with implosion during a reducing
temperature environment were most commonly seen in the FCR collection at site 41TR203,
suggesting that earth oven cooking was commonly employed here to steam shellfish and
mammals.
Socio-economic implications of earth oven utilization include general broadening of the dietary
spectrum and intensification of forager interaction on the Archaic cultural landscape. While earth
oven cooking does allow for more types of foods to be rendered nutritious and delicious, in this
situation, the predominant use of earth ovens may be the result of the foragers utilizing one type
of preparation to cook both shellfish and venison together. Earth oven clambakes are well known
in the ethnographic literature and for lean meats such as venison, bone-in earth oven preparation
provides an Archaic substitute to bone marrow extraction, effectively rendering bone lipids
throughout the fabric of the meat, making it succulently palatable, more nutritious, and
deliciously tender.
Feature 10, within AU 1, was a basin-shaped burned rock cluster of 426 pieces of FCR
(weighing 61.93 kg) that was 1.5 m in diameter and 30 cm deep, dating to approximately 1280 to
1050 yr Cal BP. Feature 15, within AU 5, contained 94 rocks, weighing approximately 24.36 kg.
FCR use at site 41TR203 appears to have increased exponentially over time. If volumetric FCR
is a measure of subsistence intensity, then subsistence regimes appear to pulse and to intensify
over time, with the most energetically intense episode represented by Feature 10.

In all but a few examples, the FCR appear to represent one limestone outcrop, probably the
Kimamitia, Fort Worth, or Duck Creek limestone formations; however, without microscopic or
XRD confirmation, this is uncertain. Mineral inclusions within the FCR fragments include iron,
limonite, and pyrite nodules. An outcrop of the Fort Worth/Duck Creek interface exists
immediately across the Trinity River from site 41TR203, in between the river and what is now
Bluff Street. One example of sandstone from an unidentified source is also present
Refit analysis allows for description of the form and sequencing of fractures scars. Refit analysis
was limited to stone from within individual features. A potentially fruitful future avenue of
research would be to attempt to refit FCR fragments between features of suspected co-terminus
activity. Although beyond the scope of this research, refit analysis of FCR amid features could
determine direct connections on the landscape between various hearth features and area of
discarded.
Four features, with more than 20 FCR fragments each, were subjected to statistical analysis to
evaluate the fractal dimension of their size/frequency distributions (Table 12.9). What, if
anything, may we conclude from the results of the statistical analysis of the fractal dimension for
FCR from Features 10, 15, 30, and 42? The analysis indicates that the archeological sample of
FCR is not fully fractal in its size/frequency distributions.
While it is beyond the scope of this research, a fractal analysis of waste fragments from
controlled FCR experiments designed with graduated thermal variances could perhaps isolate the
differences, identify the pattern, and help frame further questions. Experimentally testing the
size/frequency distributions related to the predicable physical process of thermal weathering may
help explain the phenomenon. It also may be fruitful to conduct further statistical analysis of the
cumulative distributions of the different AUs against each other, in pairs, to see if they are
statistically indistinguishable or if the difference is statistically significant.
Utilizing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) 2-sample test to measure the maximum distance
between two cumulative distributions, we discern if the distributions are the same or different
(Tables 12.7 and 12.8). Further use of this type of test in FCR analysis, coupled with further
experimental replication of specific features could perhaps lead to isolation of behavioral and/or
physical processes within the regression patterns. In this case we are able to determine that FCR

sample size, the data suggest that sampling size bias may be the primary driver.

CHAPTER 13 â SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS

By: Julie Shipp, James W. Karbula, and Mary Jo Galindo
13.1

Research Design

The Mercado site provides the opportunity to investigate settlement patterns and subsistence
strategies within the Upper Trinity River basin in north-central Texas, and how those strategies
may have changed throughout the Late Archaic period. The research questions were approached
from a Historical Ecological perspective. Historical Ecology is a general theoretical framework
that focuses on human relationships with a particular environment over the long term and
considers the landscape as a part of human ecology. This approach provides a practical context in
which to combine archeology with ecological studies and allows for humans to both affect and
be affected by ecology rather than simply being set into the backdrop of a static environment
(BalÃ©e 1998; Crumley 1994a, 1994b).
The Historical Ecological approach is well-suited for the study of hunter-gatherer behavior at
site 41TR203, because it relies on the subsistence data. The primary archeological assemblages
from the site are faunal remains and FCR; only a handful of lithic artifacts have been recovered.
However, the botanical remains extracted from the soil were an important contribution to a
balanced perspective on the broad-spectrum diet and subsistence strategies employed by Late
Archaic hunter-gatherers in the Upper Trinity River Valley (Ferring and Yates 1997).
The Historical Ecology approach is also relevant because of the repeated occupations of the site.
The late Holocene landscape was evolving from both natural and cultural processes during these
episodic occupations by humans. The ecology of the site certainly changed over the course of the
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods, and data may be available for a Late/Transitional
Archaic period in the region, which remains poorly defined.
This Research Design includes the five main topics: 1) Paleoenvironment; 2) Regional
Chronology; 3) Subsistence Strategies; 4) Lithic Technology; and 5) Geoarcheological Analysis
of Burned Earth. Each topic heading contains completed analyses and research questions that
were addressed.

Paleoenvironment

The Late Archaic period is marked by numerous fluctuations in climate (Abbott 2011; Ferring
and Yates 1997). Human adaptations are often related to creating stability in an unpredictable
and suddenly changing climate (Butzer 1982; Rosen 2007), and a significant amount of climate
data has been compiled for the Late Holocene in north-central Texas (Ferring 1994; Ferring and
Yates 1997). However, much work remains to be done in Texas to create linkages between
climate and the availability of resources for prehistoric peoples and the subtle variability with
which these relationships changed temporally and spatially (Abbott 2011). The climate data from
site 41TR203 assists in refining our understanding of the nature of the climate from the Late
Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods, which also provided information about the seasonal use
of the site and insight into the continued use of the site during this time, including the apparent
periods of abandonment between occupations.
13.2.1

Stable Carbon Isotopes

Stable carbon isotopes analysis is an invaluable tool for which to measure changes and identify
patterns in environmental fluctuations. There are a few other sites in the Upper Trinity River
Valley where stable carbon isotopes have been reviewed, but most of these studies are
incomplete compared to the profile at site 41TR203. The existing data from these sites do,
however, reflect a climate shift around the same time, despite some variations (see Chapter 6).
Additional paleoclimate work remains to be done in order to help refine the climate shift in the
region during the Late Archaic period. Site 41TR203 was a good candidate for this due to the
wide chronological range in sample dates and good preservation at the site.
Stable carbon isotopes analysis is possible because most plants during photosynthesis
discriminate less against 13CO2 than tropical grasses (Nordt et al. 1994). The CalvinâBenson
metabolic pathway (C3) is typical of most plants, while the HatchâSlack metabolic pathway (C4)
is typical of tropical grasses (Abbott 2011). The difference in carbon isotope fractionation during
photosynthesis results in a characteristic carbon isotope ratio that serves as a diagnostic indicator
for the occurrence of C3 and C4 plants. The two types of plant species have distinct, nonoverlapping values. The Î´13C values of C3 plants range from approximately -32 to -20 percent
Mercado Site (41TR203)

with a mean of -27 percent, while C4 plants range from approximately -17 to -9 percent with a
mean of -13 percent (Nordt et al. 1994:109).
Humphrey and Ferring (1994) studied a series of 58 lacustrine, spring and pedogenic carbonate
samples from site 41DN479, the Aubrey Clovis site about 52 miles north-northeast of
site 41TR203 (Figure 13.1) (Ferring and Yates 1997:43). At the Aubrey site, the early Holocene
samples are depleted in Î´13C, while those from the middle Holocene (8000 to 4000 yr Cal BP)
are enriched, followed by a return to lighter compositions in the late Holocene. The analyses
demonstrated a discrete episode with depleted isotopes in the latest Pleistocene, indicating
temperatures colder than at present. Alternatively, this trend could signify an influx of depleted
meltwaters to the Gulf of Mexico. Either way, the depletion is followed by a rapid warming trend
into the Holocene. No evidence for warmer temperatures is indicated for the middle Holocene,
Instead, annual average temperatures apparently remained stable after minor fluctuations during
the early Holocene (Ferring and Yates 1997:43).
Carbon isotope trends indicate colder and drier late Pleistocene climates, followed by wetter
conditions in the early Holocene, and a marked shift to drier climates in the middle Holocene.
The late Holocene appears to have been moist, but with a dry period ~2000 to 1200 yr Cal BP
(Ferring and Yates 1997:43). Correspondingly, rapid alluviation is indicated by the climate
during the Early Holocene (11,000 to 7500 yr Cal BP), until the slow alluviation pedogenesis of
the Middle Holocene. The Late Holocene is characterized by moderate to rapid alluviation (4500
to 2000 yr Cal BP) except for alluviation pedogenesis during dry period ~2000 to 1200 yr Cal
BP (Ferring and Yates 1997). The results of this carbon isotope study from the Aubrey site
comport well with those from site 41TR203.

Archeological Site

Similarly, the organic carbon from Late Quaternary alluvial deposits and soils from along three
streams at Fort Hood Military Reservation (about 150 miles south-southwest of site 41TR203)
was subjected to stable carbon isotope analysis by Nordt et al. (1994). The analysis revealed
significant shifts in the ratio of C3 to C4 plant biomass production during the past 15,000 years.
Results suggest that environmental conditions were the coolest and wettest between 15000 and
11000 yr Cal BP (Nordt et al. 1994), followed by a transitional period between the late
Pleistocene and the warmer and drier Holocene (11,000 to 8000 yr Cal BP), based on a slight
increase in the abundance of C4 plant biomass. Although it should be noted that it is possible for
C4 plants to grow in humid environments. During the middle Holocene (6000 to 5000 yr Cal BP)
mixed C3/C4 plant communities were nearly replaced by C4-dominated ones, indicating prairie
expansion and warmer/drier climatic conditions (Nordt et al. 1994). By 4000 yr Cal BP, the ratio
of C3 to C4 productivity was similar to the transitional period, suggesting a return to a
cooler/wetter climate. Nordt et al. (1994) detected no other significant shifts in the C3/C4 ratio
since that time, except for a brief increase in the abundance of C4 plant biomass around 2000 yr
Cal BP during a warmer and drier period. The results of this study from Fort Hood comport well
with those from site 41TR203. Fredrick and McKee (see Chapter 6) propose a regional signature
in the shift toward a drier climate ~2000 yr Cal BP, and data from both the Aubrey site and Fort
Hood support this assertion.
Fredrick and McKee (see Chapter 6) provided a source of paleoenvironmental information for
site 41TR203 by examining the stable carbon isotopic composition from bulk soil organic matter.
They determined that the overall trend at site 41TR203 is for a slight increase in organic carbon
from C4 plants from the start of the record around 2700 yr Cal BP to about 1900 yr Cal BP,
when the maximum contribution from C4 plants occurred (48 percent). After this point, the trend
shifted toward a decreasing contribution from C4 plants to minimum values of approximately 20
to 25 percent. Fredrick and McKee (see Chapter 6) demonstrated that this shift can be modeled
in all profiles from site 41TR203 as a second order polynomial, suggesting a maximum C4
concentration at 1897 yr Cal BP.

When compared to data from site 41TR170, which is 11.5 km southwest of site 41TR203, a
nearly identical trend in carbon isotopic signature is evident (Hall et al. 2011). The isotopic data
from site 41TR170 suggests relative stability within the Pilot Point alluvium with a 64 percent
contribution from C4 plants. Near the top of the West Fork Paleosol, Hall et al. (2011) notes a
shift toward C3 plant community dominance after around 1000 yr Cal BP. The values of Î´13C
within the Pilot Point alluvium were interpreted as representing tall grass prairie vegetation
within a wet meadow floodplain. Conditions then shifted near the top of the West Fork Paleosol
to a drier climate with lower water tables, channel incising, and the invasion of dry floodplain
trees (Hall 1982, 1990; Hall et al. 2011).
This shift occurs 900 to 1,000 years earlier at site 41TR203, and proceeds at a more gradual pace
than was described at site 41TR170 (see Chapter 6). A slightly older record is preserved at
site 41TR203, and the shift in absolute Î´13C values may be a consequence of 4site 1TR203
occupying a lower position in the valley below the major confluence of the Clear Fork and West
Fork, while site 41TR170 is positioned more than 5 miles upstream from this confluence and
along the Clear Fork Trinity River. Fredrick and McKee (see Chapter 6) propose that the shift
toward a drier climate is present as a regional signature beginning at around 2000 yr Cal BP.
However, a regional Î´13C signature is not as evident when compared with other studies in the
Upper Trinity River Valley, including sites 41TR198, 41DL203, and 41COL172 (see Figure
13.1). Of the three, the most directly comparable site is 41TR198, which is about 3.4 km (2.1 mi)
southeast and represents a much shorter time frame than site 41TR203. It is situated along the
West Fork in a similar setting as site 41TR203, except that a small tributary (Sycamore Creek)
has contributed sediments to the site (Peter and Harrison 2011). The isotopic signature from
site 41TR198 was interpreted as an increase of C3 vegetation during the period of West Fork
Soil formation and then slightly drier conditions afterwards. When examining the overall trends
at the two sites, there may be a comparable subtle shift in Î´13C at site 41TR198 within the West
Fork Soil, but a local signature is reflected in the Recent Alluvium capping the site, indicative of
Sycamore Creek inputs (see Chapter 6).

Mercado Site (41TR203)

Site 41DL203 (see Figure 13.1) is located along Rowlett Creek, a medium-sized tributary of the
East Fork of the Trinity River (Frederick 2009). The analyzed Î´13C at this site extends back to
approximately 3,100 years, demonstrating a gradual increase of C3 plants from the start of the
record until around 500 years ago. While comparable to results at site 41TR203, the shift at
site 41DL203 is much more gradual and it begins earlier in time than at site 41TR203. Frederick
(2009:102) attributed this discrepancy to pedogenic processes having more of an influence on
smoothing the record rather than on reflecting the regional depositional processes. Site
41COL172 (see Figure 13.1) is located along Muddy Creek, another tributary of the East Fork
Trinity River (McKee 2010). The analyzed Î´13C at this site does not quite stretch back 1,000
years and results were highly variable from sample to sample. There is overall a general trend of
decreasing C4 vegetation from the start of the record until around 400 years ago followed by a
trend back toward increasing C4 vegetation within the Recent Alluvium, which is similar to
observations at site 41DL203 (Fredrick and McKee; see Chapter 6). Research Design questions
included:
1. Were there any major climate shifts that occurred near the end of the Late Archaic?
Palynological data from the Weakly Bog suggest that from 2400 to 1500 yr Cal BP vegetation in
central Texas probably consisted of open woodland dominated by oaks with some open
grassland areas. Around 1500 yr Cal BP, near the end of the Late Archaic, a prolonged period of
drier and warmer climatic conditions existed in central Texas, according to this fossil pollen
record (Bryant and Holloway 1985:62).
Wetter conditions were evident at the Aubrey site during the early Holocene, followed a marked
shift to drier climates in the middle Holocene (8000 to 4000 yr Cal BP) (Ferring and Yates
1997:43). The late Holocene appears to have been moist, but with a dry period ~2000 to 1200 yr
Cal BP. The stable carbon isotopes analysis at Fort Hood indicates that during the middle
Holocene (6000 to 5000 yr Cal BP) the prairie expanded amid warmer and drier climatic
conditions, only to return to a cooler and wetter climate by 4000 yr Cal BP, the beginning of the
Late Archaic (Nordt et al. 1994). Conditions have remained relatively stable, except for a brief
increase in the abundance of C4 plant biomass around 2000 yr Cal BP along with relatively

warmer/drier conditions (Nordt et al. 1994). These results at the Aubrey site and Fort Hood
resonate with findings at 41TR203, and together indicate a perceptible climate shift during the
last quarter of the Late Archaic period to more xeric conditions.
2. Do the climate shifts and C3/C4 patterns at site 41TR203 correlate to other contemporary
sites in the region?
3. What is the pattern of shifting C3 and C4 faunal and floral specimens? Does the pattern
correlate with the AUs at the site?
Fredrick and McKee (see Chapter 6) propose that this shift toward a drier climate is present as a
north Texas regional signature (at sites 41TR170 and 41TR203) beginning at around 2000 yr Cal
BP, based on stable carbon isotopes analysis. Whereas, at two other comparative sites (41DL203
and 41COL172; see Figure 13.1), the correlating shift occurs 400 to 500 years ago, but these
discrepancies may be attributed to local pedogenic processes.
These findings suggest that while the central Texas palynological record provides an
approximate framework for the paleoenvironment of north Texas, the studies of stable carbon
isotopes at sites 41TR170 and 41TR203, along with prior studies in the Upper Trinity River
Valley region and at Fort Hood, have produced a more refined sequence with regional
implications (Table 13.1). At site 41TR203, AU 6 dates to 2760 to 2145 yr Cal BP, when C4
plant communities are near their maximum and approaching the threshold identified by Frederick
and McKee (see Chapter 6) for the onset of warmer and drier conditions and decreasing C4 plant
communities (Table 13.2). This comports with central Texas fossil pollen data (Nordt et al.
1994). AUs 1 and 3 (1280 to 970 yr Cal BP and 1055 to 930 yr Cal BP, respectively) correspond
to a xeric period increasingly dominated by C3 plant communities such as dry floodplain trees
(Hall et al. 2011) and more open oak-savanna (Holloway et al. 1987). Conversely, AUs 7 and 8
(2720 to 2350 yr Cal BP and 2740 to 2355 yr Cal BP, respectively) correspond to mesic
conditions increasingly dominated by C4 plant communities (see Chapter 6.)

Sedimentation Rates

Frederick and McKee (see Chapter 6) used 33 radiocarbon dates from both feature contexts and
microartifact samples in each of the Blocks (A through C) at site 41TR203 to produce a
composite age-depth model that reflects the sedimentation rate. Models for each profile were
produced by using radiocarbon ages that were calibrated according to a published radiocarbon
calibration curve, standard deviations, and depth measurements. The age-depth models were
calculated, making the sole assumption in each case that the sediments were deposited with the
oldest deposits at the bottom and youngest at the top. The 95 percent CI of the age-depth model

and the probability distributions of each sampled date were then plotted and an image file created
(see Chapter 6, Figure 6.12). This method allowed for the sedimentation rates of each of the
profiles to be compared. Research Design questions included:
1. Do sedimentation rates correlate with occupations?
2. Does the sedimentation at the site reflect a steady deposition, or were there variations in
flood plain aggradation rates?
3. What is the relationship between the paleosol and AUs 6 through 8? Did the slower
sedimentation during this period affect the context of the cultural material, and to what
degree?
4. Are the variations in sedimentation rates attributed to rainfall, channel migration, channel
incision, or a combination of these factors?
Although each block contained a comparable stratigraphic profile, there were differences in agedepth projections for the upper portion of the profile (between approximately 20 and 60 cm) that
varied by up to 500 years. Thus, it was concluded that the most reliable approach was to
aggregate all the radiocarbon ages for the site and use the combined data set to compile an agedepth model for the entire site (see Chapter 6). This approach was useful for assessing temporal
variations in sedimentation rate at the site and estimating the probable age of the different
occupations. The results suggest that the sedimentation rate at site 41TR203 has varied through
time, between periods of relatively rapid sedimentation and periods of slower sedimentation
(Tables 13.3 and 13.4). The pattern at the Mercado site is more complicated than what Ferring
and Yates (1997) describe for the Upper Trinity River Valley, where rapid alluviation is
indicated during the Early Holocene (11,000 to 7500 yr Cal BP), until the slow alluviation
pedogenesis of the Middle Holocene. Further, the Late Holocene is characterized by moderate to
rapid alluviation (4500 to 2000 yr Cal BP) except for alluviation pedogenesis during dry period
~2000 to 1200 yr Cal BP (Ferring and Yates 1997).

At the Mercado site, sediment accumulated at the relatively slow rate of 5.28 cm per century
during AUs 6, 7, and 8 (~2040 to 2600 yr Cal BP); whereas, moderate to rapid alluviation is
indicated for the Upper Trinity River Valley during a much broader 2500-year span that
encompasses AUs 6, 7, and 8 (Ferring and Yates 1997). Conversely, during AU 2 (~1200 to
1450 yr Cal BP) sedimentation at the Mercado site proceeded at a relatively fast rate during the
tail end of an 800-year dry period in the Upper Trinity River Valley.
Importantly, seven of the eight AUs defined at site 41TR203 correspond to periods of slower
sedimentation, which may have contributed to their overall integrity. Three of these, AUs 6, 7,
and 8, are preserved within the Paleosol that occurs at the site below the West Fork Soil at depths
greater than 1 m. Frederick and McKee (see Chapter 6) conclude that the presence of the
Paleosol at site 41TR203 is most likely related to the mechanics of sedimentation within or
adjacent to the meander belt of the Trinity River channel. Stable Carbon Isotopes data (see Table
13.2) indicate the period from 2700 to 1900 yr Cal BP was dominated by C4 plant communities
(see Chapter 6), which is indicative of higher rainfall and more mesic conditions. Thus, a
combination of environmental factors including slower sedimentation rates likely contributed to
the formation of the Paleosol preserving AUs 6, 7, and 8 at site 41TR203.

5. What are the post-depositional disturbances?
6. Do sedimentation rates correlate with the other environmental data?
For both questions 5 and 6, Frederick and McKee (see Chapter 6) identified two areas of
probable post-depositional disturbance. The top 35 cm of site 41TR203 exhibited evidence of
disturbance by cultivation and portions of AU 7 appear to represent multiple occupations over a
long period of time and may exhibit some evidence of overprinting. Tables 13.5 and 13.6 include
isotopic and paleoclimatic data, which demonstrate that AUs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are associated with
overall xeric conditions, while AUs 6, 7, and 8 occurred during mesic conditions of the Late
Archaic.

Faunal Analysis

Faunal bone preservation at site 41TR203 is considered exceptional because out of 8,346
vertebrate specimens, 7,265 (87 percent) were identifiable to class (see Chapter 8). Even so, the

Mercado Site (41TR203)

452

July 2019

vertebrate remains at the site lack the isotopic resolution to provide detailed data on small
fluctuations in climate. However, there is a clear distinction in the assemblages from the upper
and lower portions of the site, which reflect a change in C3 and C4 environments. In addition,
bison are only present in the lower portion of the site. Some questions regarding
paleoenvironment that the faunal assemblage can address are:
1. What are the differences between the faunal assemblages from the upper portion (AUs 1
through 5) and the lower portion (AUs 6 through 8) of site 41TR203?
2. Do the changes in faunal assemblages indicate changes in C3 and C4 plants?
3. What are the results of the stable carbon isotope analysis on the rabbit specimens? Do
they correlate to the other isotope subsets?
The overall faunal assemblage is dominated by deer-sized and larger mammals, with bison
specimens present from 2645 to 2000 yr Cal BP throughout AUs 6, 7, and 8. The main difference
between the upper and lower portions of the site is that bison remains are not found in any AUs
that are radiocarbon dated to after 2000 yr Cal BP. Isotopic data indicates that climate conditions
during AUs 1 through 5 were xeric and dominated by C3 plant communities, while during AUs 6
through 8, conditions were more mesic and C4 plants dominated. Results of the faunal analysis
comport with the isotopic data.
Based on the dominance of grassland species (bison, rabbit, pocket gopher, etc.) in AU 8 and the
presence of aquatic/wetland species, Jacobson (see Chapter 8) interpreted the paleoenvironment
during 2645 to 2430 yr Cal BP as open grassland prairie or potentially grassland floodplain with
a reliable water source that was shallow, slow moving, and had a muddy bottom like that of an
oxbow, slough, or slow meander. Within AU 8, the presence of reptiles (mainly turtles) was the
lone indicator of seasonal occupation during March to November (based on historic and modern
daily temperature averages). The types of both bison and deer skeletal parts recovered indicated
that these animals were processed and consumed at site 41TR203, with some long bones
exhibiting spiral fractures associated with marrow extraction.

Mercado Site (41TR203)

453

July 2019

The faunal bone in AU 7 was the most diverse of any analytical unit with grassland and prairie
species dominating the assemblage. Jacobson (see Chapter 8) interpreted the paleoenvironment
during 2660 to 2210 yr Cal BP as an early-stage successional environment with grassland
transitioning to scrub brush chaparral and riparian woodland with an aquatic habitat. The
presence of reptiles and Canadian geese, the latter of which would have been in residence during
October to March (based on known daily temperature averages), suggests year-round occupation
of site 41TR203 during AU 7. Bison and deer skeletal parts continue to indicate that they were
processed and consumed on-site, including long bones with spiral fractures.
AU 6 also contained bison and rabbit, but no deer specimens among a sparse faunal bone
assemblage (n = 67). Jacobson (see Chapter 8) tentatively interpreted the paleoenvironment at
2345 to 2145 yr Cal BP as an open grassland or woodland edge habitat. AU 5 dates from 1815 to
1570 yr Cal BP and contained deer and rabbit specimens along with turtles, but no bison were in
the assemblage. Another shell midden is represented in AU 4, dating from 1710 to 1415 yr Cal
BP. The faunal bone assemblage from AU 4 included dog, coyote, and other unidentified
medium- to large-sized mammals, exclusively.
No bones from aquatic or bird species were in the assemblage from AU 3, which dates from
1055 to 1025 yr Cal BP. Jacobson inferred a late September to November occupation and
interpreted the paleoenvironment during AU 3 as mixed scrub brush and woodland or woodland
edge habitat. No seasonal indicators were discernable for AUs 1 and 2, and both assemblages
contained minimal deer and other mammal bone. Preservation in AU 2 was indicative of the
bone being rapidly buried, comporting with the rapid soil sedimentation rate during 1530 to 1200
yr Cal BP (see Chapter 6). Table 13.7 illustrates how isotopic and faunal analyses complement
each other to provide paleoenvironmental reconstructions that span all but AU 2.

OxCAL Modeling of Radiocarbon Ages and Analytical Units
Introduction

To further refine the range of all radiocarbon ages and of the indicated analytical unit date ranges
at the Mercado site (41TR203), a widely available calibration software program OxCAL was
employed to apply Bayesian radiocarbon models and statistics to collected data. Bayesian
chronological models are statistical models that interpret both relative and absolute chronological
information for archeological projects (Buck and Juarez, 2017:2). These Bayesian techniques are
developed over the last 30 years by statisticians and software developers capitalizing on a
revolution in our ability to implement simulation-based models, as opposed to an exact
calculation approach (Buck and Juarez, 2017:2). With modern-simulation based implementation

456

methods, stratigraphic information and the Bayesian solution equation can now be applied to
very large stratigraphic sequences using widely available Bayesian radiocarbon calibration
packages such as OxCAL (Black and Juarez 2017:13). The current version of OxCAL v 4.3.2
online was utilized for the current analyses (Bronk Ramsey 2017), using the r:5 IntCal 13
atmospheric calibration curve (Reimer et al. 2013). All of the collected radiocarbon dates which
have been assigned to an AU, including bone collagen isotopic radiocarbon dates from specially
collected samples, were subject to a modeling export in OxCAL. This has resulted in more
precise date estimates that otherwise would be obtained by individual calibrations. This work is
greatly assisted by following Millardâs (2015) introduction to model building in OxCAL.
A total of 28 radiocarbon dates were utilized to develop phase-based models of AUs (see
Table 7.2). Each of these individual dates is assigned to an AU through multiple lines of other
archeological data, including conventional radiocarbon ages, depth below surface, archeological
content, and correlations to the Mercado site geoarchaeological age-depth model. Of these, seven
dates are bone collagen dates more recently analyzed (Beta 494143, 494144, 494147, 494149,
494150, 494151, 494152). From Table 10.1, AUs 1 through 3 date at 2-sigma calibrations to a
range of 930 to 1530 yr Cal BP (Late Prehistoric), AUs 4 and 5 to a range of 1415 to 1815 yr Cal
BP (Transitional Archaic), and AUs 6 through 8 to 2145 to 2740 yr Cal BP (Late Archaic).
In OxCal, individual radiocarbon dates, sequences of dates, or cultural phases, or more complex
sequences with phases, or multiple sequences can be modeled. And other information can be
incorporated such as phase boundaries based on the presumed age of a collection of
archeological materials, without having actual radiocarbon sample ages that distinguish the
boundary. For the Mercado site modeling, each group of AUs (n = 3), was modeled as a potential
phase of occupations that occurred at the site. The model for each group of AUs (AUs 1 through
3, 4, 5, and 6 through 8) was asked to assign a beginning and ending boundary, based on the
statistical calculations. The calibrated conventional ages of specific point-plotted and dated
charcoal samples were entered into the model for each phase. Results are available in single plots
of each radiocarbon age showing the highest probability modeled in actual calendar ages
(BC/AD), and also a modeled radiocarbon determination in yr Cal BP, and as multiple plots that

illustrate the modeled calendar ages relationally to one another within the phase. Results are also
available as curve plots that exhibit the modeled range of radiocarbon years in yr Cal BP, and the
specific calendar dates relationally to one another. In these plots, outlier dates that do not fit the
modeled data are easily observed and isolated.
13.3.2

AUs 6 through 8, Oldest Occupation Zone

Consider that the 2-sigma calibrated age range of the oldest prehistoric occupation at the site
(2145 to 2740 yr Cal BP, Late Archaic) is approximately 595 years. From Figures 13.2 and 13.3,
a much narrower modeled range of 120 years is predicted, from approximately 2360 to 2480 yr
Cal BP, still well within the Late Archaic time frame. The model utilized 12 calibrated
radiocarbon ages, including bone collagen dates. Five bone collagen dates are represented, which
fit perfectly into the age range for the Late Archaic model (Beta 494144, 494149, 494150,
494151, 494152). One is a piece of bison bone from Feature 20.1 in AU 8 (Beta 494149).
Feature 20.1 is identified as an earth oven with an associated rake-out or discard pile. A second
bison element with a closely equivalent date was recovered in Feature 32 during a trench
expansion. Feature 32 is identified as a small basined hearth in AU 7 containing numerous faunal
and charred elements, including bison, deer, and rabbit. A third is identified as Bovidae in
Feature 41 in AU 7 (Beta 494152). Feature 41 is a rock cluster not readily assigned to a feature
type. Deer bone collected from AUs 7 and 8 in non-feature contexts (Beta 494151, 494144) also
support the modeled date ranges (see Table 7.3).
There is clearly one outlier that is not included in this predicted age range. The outlier is a piece
of charred hardwood collected in Feature 18 (Beta 396632, 396634), recorded as a small
burned rock hearth in Block A, Zone 3, in AU 6, at approximately 124 cmbd (Table 7.2).
Feature 18 exhibits clearly earlier conventional dates at 2210 and 2250 +/- 30 yr Cal BP than the
rest of the model and may represent an earlier more isolated campsite that occurred some 200
years before the bulk of the occupation in AUs 7 and 8 at approximately 2400 yr Cal BP; and
yet Feature 18 is dated well after Features in AUs 4 and 5 at approximately 1700 to 1800 yr Cal
BP. In calendar dates, without the outlier and ignoring the modeled boundaries, looking
only at the specific modeled dates, this oldest occupation at the site is modeled at
Mercado Site (41TR203)

458

700-380 BC, a span of approximately 320 calendar years. With the phase boundaries as
predicted by the model, the phase is dated in calendar years from 800 to 380 BC
(approximately 540 years). Predominantly, in terms of diagnostic projectile points, Gary
projectiles were recovered in AUs 6 through 8. Thus, the Gary occupation at the Mercado site
may have occurred from 2360 to 2480 yr Cal BP based on Bayesian statistical modeling
analyses conducted in OxCal.

AUs 4 and 5, Late/Transitional Archaic Occupation Zone

The actual 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon ages for AUs 4 and 5 indicate a range of 1415 to 1815
yr Cal BP, a range of approximately 400 years. From Figures 13.4 and 13.5, again, a much more
narrowed, modeled range of 1620 to 1780 yr Cal BP is predicted covering a span of 160 years.
The model utilizes 5 calibrated radiocarbon ages. One outlier is excluded from the model and
Figures 13.5 and 13.5; a bone collagen date that does not support the proposed range is a piece of
rabbit bone (Sylvilagus sp.) from Feature 14, from 49 to 60 cmbd. The 2-sigma calibrated age
range is much younger than expected at 1172 to 956 yr Cal BP (Beta 494147, see Table 7.3).
Feature 14 was a midden-like mussel shell scatter. One explanation for the younger date on this
rabbit bone in this zone of relatively good context, from 45 to 75 cmbs in all of the block
excavations at the site, would be intrusion of the rabbit bone. In calendar dates, also without the
outlier, this transitional prehistoric occupation at the site is OxCal modeled at 200 to 450 AD, a
250-year time span. The boundaries of the Phase are modeled at 50 to 650 AD (approximately
600 years).

AUs 1 through 3, Late Prehistoric Occupation Zone

The actual 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon ages for AUs 1â3 indicate a range of 930 to 1530 yr
Cal BP, just over 600 years. From Figures 13.6 and 13.7, a third much more narrowed, modeled
range of 1060 to 1260 yr Cal BP is predicted covering a span of 200 years. The model utilizes six
calibrated radiocarbon ages. One outlier is excluded from the model and Figures 13.6 and 13.7; a
bone collagen date that does not support the proposed range is a piece of deer bone collected
from non-feature contexts in AU 3 (Beta 494143), from 22 to 30 cmbd. The 2-sigma calibrated
age range is much older than expected at 1376-1528 yr Cal BP (see Table 7.3). Again, there is a
potential issue with a bone collagen date from a non-feature context, although AUs 1 through 3
appear to exhibit relatively good sediment context from 10 to 50 cmbs at the site. In calendar
dates, also without the outlier, this Late Prehistoric occupation at the site is OxCal modeled at
700 to 1025 AD, a 325-year time span. The boundaries of the Phase are modeled at 550 to 1175
AD (approximately 625 years).

of mussel shell can reveal where habitat shell was harvested from (i.e., the nature of the local
water source). The stable carbon isotope analysis on the mussel shell provides data regarding the
environmental changes at the site during the eight described occupations. Mussels (Anodontidae
and zebra mussels) can live only one year and those that do typically live in ponds or ephemeral
streams. However, those mussels are highly unlikely to arrive in archeological deposits because
they produce thin shells that easily fracture. The majority of the mussels found in site 41TR203
live >10 years but less than 80. Based on their size it is estimate that most were around 4 to 5
years old. Thus, the shell isotope data are accurate measures of the weather during the correlating
occupations.
Mussel shells contain a record of the oxygen isotope ratios of the water bodies in which they
grew (Abell 1985:184). In general, most mussels grow in isotopic equilibrium with their aqueous
environment (Fritz and Poplawksi 1974). The ratio of oxygen-isotope concentrations, Î´18O, is
one of the most widely recognized paleoenvironmental proxies, although more commonly used
in ocean contexts (Caran 1998). The oxygen isotopes are found within the carbonate radical in
calcium carbonate, which is the main compound in mussel shell composition. The ratio is
considered to be directly related to water temperature because the rate of evaporation of water
generally increases with temperature, resulting in the depletion of 16O and the relative
enrichment of the heavier isotope 18O in the remaining water. In this scenario, temperature is
assumed to be the only factor capable of affecting the rate of evaporation, ignoring cloud cover,
humidity, water turbidity, and other variables.
Paul Abell (1985) used oxygen isotope ratios of 80 modern gastropod shells from throughout
Africa to demonstrate a correlation with rainfall patterns as indicated by permanent vegetative
cover. Negative oxygen isotope ratios corresponded closely with these vegetated areas that
received substantial rainfall (Abell 1985:192).

All the oxygen isotope ratios from site 41TR203 are in the negative range (Table 13.9),
indicating ample rainfall while the site was occupied. Within each AU, variation among the
samples is evident (Table 13.10). Notably, within Feature 14 in AU 5 the samples varied by 2.48 percent, while Feature 21 samples from AU 4 varied by -1.31 percent, and Feature 10
samples from AU 1 varied by -0.85 percent. The degree of variation in Feature 14 samples (AU
5) and in those from AU 2 suggests a possible mixture of shells of different ages and
environments, although discrepancies in the oxygen isotope ratios may result from temperature
effects on precipitation and the evaporative isotope enrichment of rainfall and water bodies
(Abell 1985). The smallest variation occurs in AU 8 samples, suggesting that Lot 144 may be
closely associated with Feature 20, along with Lot 169.

Abell (1985) identified several potential pitfalls with studying oxygen isotope ratios in mussel
shell, including:
â¢

Shells of most freshwater mussels are mainly aragonite, whose crystal structure is
thermodynamically unstable relative to calcite (Folk 1965); therefore, the potential exists
for a continuous process of recrystallization and a concomitant isotope recalibration with
the new environment. Thus, ancient shells with evidence of recrystallization should not
be sampled.

â¢

The reworking of the sediments in which mussel shells were embedded can produce a
mixture of shells of different ages and environments. Rolled and weathered shells must
remain suspect and not be sampled.

â¢

The isotopic content of a body of water is not necessarily an accurate reflection of the
total local environment. For example, the oxygen isotope ratios of mussels that can
successfully aestivate will reflect the highly evaporative conditions in ephemeral streams
or lakes, and their isotopic ratios will vary significantly from mussels growing in the
same locality, but in permanent water bodies.

â¢

Differentiating between temperature effects and evaporation effects on oxygen isotope
ratios is complex. Abell (1985:183) attributed discrepancies in the oxygen isotope ratios
to temperature effects on precipitation and evaporative isotope enrichment of rainfall and

Mercado Site (41TR203)

water bodies. Grossman (1982) calculated a temperature-oxygen isotope ratio
relationship for the precipitation of aragonite. At 25Â°C, an increase of 1Â°C in water
temperature produces an oxygen isotope ratio roughly 0.2 percent more negative.
Mussel shell preservation at site 41TR203 was evaluated as moderate (see Chapter 10), in part
because the most abundant taxa (Fusconaia spp. and C. mortoni) are of only moderate
preservation potential and there are multiple species of low preservation potential (L. teres and L.
hydiana) present within the siteâs assemblage. Lampsilini species are most often found within
sandy banks near slow waters. L. teres are intolerant of drought, while Fusconaia spp. are
indicative of headwater streams. Overall, the mussel assemblage from site 41TR203 was adapted
to a small river with shallow water (less than 1.5 m deep), exhibiting variable velocity, and with
small gravel and sand substrate (see Chapter 10).
13.5

Research Questions

1. What are the changes in temperature and rainfall in AUs 1 through 8?
Based on the relatively consistent oxygen isotope ratios from AU 1 through AU 8, there does not
appear to be significant change in temperature and rainfall reflected in the mussel shell
composition. Average 18O ratios for AUs range from -2.92 percent for AU 2 to -4.51 percent for
AU 4, a difference of -1.59 percent. Average ratios for all other AUs cluster around -4 percent
(Table 13.11). Thus, there does not appear to be a correlation between oxygen isotope ratios and
mesic or xeric climatic conditions as derived from other sources (see Chapter 6; Hall et al. 2011;
Holloway et al. 1987). Marked variation within samples from the same AU, such as between
Lots 50 and 65 in AU 2 and Lots 121 and 128 in AU 5 (see Table 13.10), suggests a possible
mixture of shells of different ages and environments, or possibly higher temperatures affecting
the evaporative isotope enrichment of rainfall and water bodies (Abell 1985). AU 2 represents
330 years, and AU 5 is a 40-year interval, while a mussel shell can at most represent a single
year, providing but a glimpse into its paleoclimate.

2. What is the nature of the river over the course of the siteâs occupations?
The West Fork of the Trinity River during the occupation of site 41TR203 was a small river with
a gravel and sand substrate and shallow water that exhibited variable velocity, as evidenced by
the diversity of mussels in the assemblage (see Chapter 10). The consistently negative values for
oxygen isotope ratios of mussel shell during all AUs indicate ample rainfall that would have
supported permanent vegetative cover (Abell 1985).
3. Do the shifts in mussel species correlate with changes in C3 and C4 plants?
Similar to the lack of correlation with climatic condition, there does not appear to be shifts in
mussel species that correspond to changes in C3 and C4 plants. This may be a consequence of
the less than ideal preservation of the mussel shell assemblage, or of the relatively short span of
time that is reflected by a mussel shell compared to the length of an analytical unit at site
41TR203. Also there could be multiple changes in isotopic signatures within an AU.

Regional Chronology

The Mercado site is located in the Upper Trinity River Basin, which begins at the northern end of
the Trinity basin, from the headwaters of the four branches of the Trinity River, Clear Fork, West
Fork, Elm Fork, and East Fork, down to the southern end of Dallas County. Significant
comparable sites within the Upper Trinity River Basin that contain Late Archaic components
were identified, and the archeological assemblages compared with those at site 41TR203 in an
attempt to further refine the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods in north-central Texas.
The goal was to compare the Mercado site with the other sites in relation to our research topics
of paleoenvironment, subsistence strategies, and the geoarcheological burned earth analysis.
13.7

Radiocarbon Dating

In order to compare site 41TR203 with other Late Archaic sites in the Upper Trinity River Basin,
additional radiocarbon samples were collected from all features and from within all defined
cultural zones to refine the chronology at the site. Radiocarbon dating is especially important
given the paucity of diagnostic artifacts recovered from the site. Research questions regarding
radiocarbon dating included:
1. What are the date ranges for the AUs?
2. Do these ranges match other sites in the region for Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
occupations?
3. Are there date ranges in the AUs for cultural periods that have not been previously
defined?
Analysis of the detailed AUs 1 through 8 using multiple lines of archeological,
geoarchaeological and zooarchaeological evidence indicates prehistoric cultural occupations at
the Mercado site (41TR203) can be meaningfully evaluated in terms of three main prehistoric
periods in the north-central Texas regional chronology. These are the Late Archaic,
Late/Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods in the north-central Texas regional
archeological record. Per 2, the Archaic period in north-central Texas extended from
approximately 8500 to 1250 yr Cal BP with three subdivisions, early (8500 to 6000 yr Cal BP),
Mercado Site (41TR203)

473

July 2019

middle (6000 to 3500 yr Cal BP), and late (3500 to 1250 yr Cal BP), distinguished mainly by
projectile point types and inferred climate changes and shifting subsistence strategies (Prikryl
1990). Based on the definition of Analytical Units 3 and 4 at site 41TR203, a Late/Transitional
Archaic period for the West Fork of the Trinity River is proposed (1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP),
overlapping the early Late Prehistoric period. Finally, the Late Prehistoric period can be divided
into Late Prehistoric I (1250 to 750 yr Cal BP) and Late Prehistoric II (750 to 250 yr Cal BP)
(Prikryl 1993).
Multiple lines of archeological evidence indicate there is considerable overlap in cultural
components between three different groupings of AUs, which basically correspond to their
locations in the terrace sediment profiles. Lines of evidence include 2-sigma calibrated
radiocarbon ages from feature contexts, faunal and stone tool associations, depth below surface,
and feature morphology within the context of the intact and nearly pristine terrace sediments, and
the presence of the deeply buried paleosol. There is considerable overlap observed in cultural
content, feature morphologies, organics, and stone tool assemblages between different groupings
of AUs. These lines of evidence are discussed below within the context of the AUs, by the
associated features and artifacts recorded within AUs, and within the overall framework of the
geoarchaeological model. Geoarchaeological data in the form of micro-stratigraphic studies and
the age-sedimentation model support this analysis. The meaningful groupings of AUs to be
examined are AUs 1 through 3 (Late Prehistoric), AUs 4 and 5 (Late/Transitional Archaic), and
AUs 6 through 8 (Late Archaic).
Frederick and McKeeâs analysis (see Chapter 6), which included bulk physical properties,
radiocarbon dating, micro-artifacts, and soil micromorphology, revealed 13 identifiable
occupations (A through M) within a 1.5-m alluvial profile containing approximately 2,700 years
of cultural deposition. The 13 occupations vary significantly in terms of length, intensity,
integrity, and cultural features. However, per Frederick and McKee (see Chapter 6), some of the
more ephemeral or minor occupation zones have âvery small artifact occurrences and either are
occupations for which the blocks are on the edge of the occupation surface or very short duration
stays.â Thus, assigning each of the occupation zones to AUs may be a too literal interpretation of

Mercado Site (41TR203)

474

July 2019

the micro-artifact depths, in light of other evidence, and some of the occupations represented as
distinct events in different blocks may be the same event owing to small vagaries in
sedimentation.â The inferred geoarchaeological age of AUs 1 through 3 (Occupations B through
E) is 1400 to 600 yr Cal BP. The actual 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon ages for AUs 1 through 3
indicate a range of 1530 to 930 yr Cal BP, a relatively close correlation (Table 13.1). The feature
related radiocarbon ages from AUs 1 through 3 emanate from charred Cherry and Oak wood
embedded in rock Features 10 and 13 (Betas 39610 to 39613, Betas 39615 and 39616) (see
Table 7.2). This series of Late Prehistoric occupations is recorded from 10 to 50 cmbs in the
block excavations correlating to the West Fork Soil of the Upper Point Alloformation in the
terrace setting. This is a sediment range of only 40 cmbs in depth. A bone collagen date from the
general occupation zone on deer bone (Odocoilus virgianus) yielded an overlapping 2-sigma
calibrated radiocarbon range of 1528 to 1376 yr Cal BP (Beta 494143) (see Table 7.3).
The inferred geoarchaeological age of AUs 4 and 5 is 1730 to 1350 yr Cal BP. The actual 2sigma calibrated radiocarbon ages for AUs 4 and 5 indicate a range of 1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP,
another relatively close correlation. The feature-related radiocarbon ages from AUs 4 and 5
emanate from charred red and white oak, ash and elm and other hardwood associated with
Features14, 21 and 26 (Betas 396617, 396618, 396629, 396635, and 396636; see Table 7.2).
Features 14, 21, and 26 are three midden-like mussel shell scatters (see Chapter 7). This series of
Late/Transitional Archaic prehistoric occupations is recorded from 40 to 75 cmbs in the block
excavations at the lower contact of the West Fork Soil transitioning into the Lower Pilot Point
Alloformation in the terrace setting. This is a sediment range of only 35 cm in depth. One bone
collagen date that does not support the proposed range is a piece of rabbit bone (Sylvilagus sp.)
from Feature 14. The 2-sigma calibrated age range is younger than expected at 1172 to 956 yr
Cal BP (Beta 494147) (see Table 7.3).
The inferred geoarchaeological age of AUs 6 though 8 is 2600 to 2033 yr Cal BP. The actual
2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon ages for AUs 6 through 8 indicate a range of 2740 to 2145 yr Cal
BP, a third relatively close correlation. The feature-related radiocarbon ages from AUs 6 through
8 emanate from charred white oak, cherry, pecan, and other hardwoods associated with

Mercado Site (41TR203)

475

Features 20.1, 24, 32, 41, 42, and 43 (Betas 396625, 396626, 396620, 396633, 396624, 396637,
396622, and 396623, respectively; see Table 7.2). Feature 20.1 is identified as an earth oven with
an associated rake-out or discard pile. Feature 24 is identified as a cooking pit of ash and burned
earth. Features 32, 42, and 43 are identified as small basin-shaped hearths. Feature 41 is only
loosely categorized as a possible a small hearth, earth oven lid remnant, or discard pile (see
Chapter 7). This Late Archaic occupation is recorded from 90 to 145 cmbs located within the
Paleosol identified within the Lower Pilot Point Alloformation in the terrace setting. This is a
sediment range of only 55 cmbs in depth.
Bone collagen radiocarbon ages are in support of the charred wood sample ages for AUs 6
through 8. Bison bone from Feature 20 and Feature 32 yielded 2-sigma calibrations of 2536 to
2351 yr Cal BP and 2723 to 2383 yr Cal BP, respectively (Betas 494149, 494150; see Table 7.3).
A third specimen of probable Bison (Bovidae) from Feature 41 yielded a supportive 2-sigma
radiocarbon age of 2703 to 2360 yr Cal BP (Beta 494152), remarkably enough. Deer bone
(Odocoilus hemionus) from the general cultural layer was 2-sigma radiocarbon dated at 2489 to
2337 yr Cal BP (Beta 494151). A second specimen of deer bone (Odocoilus sp.) from the general
occupation zone was dated at 2688 to 2350 yr Cal BP (Beta 494144). The bone collagen dates
exhibit considerable overlap, indeed.
Prikrylâs (1990) cultural sequence for the North Central Texas range of dates for the Late
Archaic period is 3500 to 1250 yr Cal BP and best correlates to the three deepest AUs (6, 7, and
8) at site 41TR203 (Late Archaic, 2740 to 2145 yr Cal BP). Prikrylâs 2,250-year span for the
Late Archaic contains what is categorized at the Mercado site (41TR203) as a Late/Transitional
Archaic period (1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP). The Late/Transitional Archaic period date range is
associated with AUs 4 and 5. Following in the sequence, Prikrylâs Late Prehistoric I date range
spans for 500 years (1250 to 750 yr Cal BP) and would compare to 41TR203âs AUs 1, 2, and 3
(1530 to 930 yr Cal BP). There is reasonable correlation between the well documented and cited
chronological sequence by Prikryl (1990) in the Elm Fork investigations to the sequence
observed at site 41TR203, offset by a couple hundred years.

Two dart point styles that are featured at 41TR203, Gary and Ellis, were introduced in the Late
Archaic period in Northeast Texas and were continued to be utilized into the Early Ceramic
period dating from 200 BC to AD 800 (Story 1990; Turner et al. 2002). This was a temporal
period when Gary points were common (Turner et al. 2002). Johnson (1962) concludes that the
Gary manufacturing changed through the course of time between the Late Archaic and
transitioning into the Early Ceramic period. The primary way the Gary points changed, was in
size (reduced) as the technology transitioned from the Late Archaic period into the Early
Ceramic period.
The end of the Archaic Period is generally thought to coincide with the appearance of the bow
and arrow, which heralded lifeway changes that altered the dynamics of human adaptive
strategies (Carpenter et al. 2013). Johnson and Goode (1994) describe this transitional period as
the most difficult and complex of all the period boundaries. They suggest that the Archaic may
have ended 400 years earlier when smaller dart points such as Darl appear, or even 400 years
later with the adoption of ceramics during the Toyah phase in central Texas (Johnson and Goode
1994:40). The issue of when these changes occur and what to call the interval is part of a larger
research problem, beyond the scope of this discussion, that would address the nature of cultural
change and continuity across north-central Texas.
An additional comparison was made with site 41DL270 (see Figure 13.1), which has interpolated
dates for their Gary like points found within the collection of being 2950 yr Cal BP and being
associated with the Late Archaic period, although one should caution that only one of the Gary
points was recovered from excavation and the rest were from a collectorâs assemblage (Anthony
and Brown 1994). In addition, site 41DL270 was approximately 200 years older the
site 41TR203. These concerns aside, similarities between sites 41DL270 and 41TR203 exist as
they appear to have a similar faunal assemblage, shell middens, hearths, and other associated
cooking features.
A total of 251 deer remains were recovered from site 41DL270, making up 22.4 percent of their
faunal collections with the remains being more abundant in top cultural zones. Bison faunal
remains are scarce in lower zones but present and represent 14.6 percent and found in the Late
Mercado Site (41TR203)

477

Archaic zones. Other faunal remains found within the assemblage consist of small mammals,
rabbits, turtle, birds, snake, vertebrata, rodents, and carnivores (Anthony and Brown 1994). The
faunal collection at site 41DL270 has many similar species that were also excavated from
site 41TR203.
Numerous sites including but not limited to sites 41DL270, 41DL12, 41DL148, and 41DL199
(see Figure 13.1) in the North-Central Texas archeological record have presence of mollusk
lenses with associated faunal and lithic assemblages. Shell middens are geographically located
near floodplains and lower terraces, as the freshwater mussels were exploited as a food source.
Sites with shell lenses are most commonly dated to the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric I
period. Site 41DL270 had two unionid bivalves identified. Of the two mollusks (Plectomerus
dombeyanus) is a possible manuport from the Trinity River system (Anthony and Brown 1994:
265â273). The Plectomerus dombeyanus is one of the common mollusks found at site 41TR203.
Other common species of mussel shells are found at both sites such as Amblema plicata,
Quadrula mortoni, Tritogonia verrucosa, Lampsilis teres, and Lampsilis hydiana.
The morphology of the features and the basic function of the site at 41DL270 are similar enough
for comparisons for the excavations at 41TR203 but lack the chronological indicators that would
help better interpret the sites. The one Late Archaic point (a possible Gary-like point) was
positioned stratigraphically in the consistent cultural zone that aligned with its temporal
framework but was older in age than what was found at 41TR203. The other six Gary points
found at site 41DL270 were analyzed within the Bill Young Collections and do not have any
context to dating the site or if the points were associated with any feature.
Gary points recovered from the Mercado site present a curious case for several reasons: they are
situated on the western frontier of the Gary landscape, they are knapped of chert as opposed to
the typical quartzite and fossilized wood, and they come from one of the better-dated and
stratified contexts documented to date (2740 to 2355 yr Cal BP), which suggests that some of
these artifacts may have been crafted nearer the onset of the Gary tradition. Additionally, at the
Mercado site, Gary points are not related to typical artifact assemblages consisting of ceramics.

Gary points, which are prolific across the Red River Basin of present-day East Texas, Louisiana,
Oklahoma, and Arkansas beginning about 2,500 years ago, predominate the lithic assemblage at
the Mercado site. The Mercado site demonstrates that Gary points are found in the Tarrant
County area around this period, possibly suggesting a westward foray of eastern occupants out
onto the southern Plains. Further, the chronometric analysis detailed in this report, as well as the
age-depth modeling by Oksanen (2018), suggests that this collection of Gary points in the
western portion of the traditional region date to approximately 2700 yr Cal BP. Not only is this
collection found farther west than usual, but it may represent the onset of the Gary tradition.
In questioning the material type of this small assemblage of Gary points from the Mercado site,
Oksanen (2018) asserts:
The selection of locally available material, chert, quartzites and siliciï¬ed wood
(petriï¬ed wood) from stream load and upland gravel sources was a determinate
for the size of the ï¬nished product. Occasionally, they were made from other chert
sourcesâthe Mercado site points are unusual as they are all made from chert. In
contrast, only four of the 35 Gary points and preforms at site 41DL203, along
Rowlett Creek, are chert. At 41HS915, the Hawkwind Site, in East Texas,
approximately half of the Gary points were chert and most of these were from
gravel sources. One of the largest collections of Gary points is from the Houston
area Diamond Knoll Site-41HS796, demonstrating the range and diversity within
the type.
Examining the breakage and fracture patterns of the 41DL203 Gary points suggests that quartzite
may have been a preferred material. The broken chert points exhibited catastrophic fractures
from impact to the extent they were discarded at a larger size than many of the quartzite points. It
appears the quartzite points were less prone to complete failure, and when breaks occurred, the
points could be rejuvenated effectively and efï¬ciently. The use of chert may be the result of athand material rather than the preferred choice. The basic shape of the Gary point allows for the
variability in workmanship [and] accommodates the inherent limitations in the lithic material,
while maximizing its toughness.
Mercado Site (41TR203)

479

July 2019

This suggests that the Gary point knappers may have been choosing more reliable materials
(non-chert) if they were readily available, because the tools would not break easily upon impact
and they would last longer because quartzite is a durable material suitable for resharpening. The
Mercado site inhabitants either lacked access to quartzite or petrified wood resources or using
chert may have been a cultural preference. A better understanding of how Central Texas chert
resources and culture influenced this northern region would shed light on this question, which is
beyond the scope of the current work.
Understanding the variability of Gary points has long been a topic of study and debate. Oksanen
(2018) examined collections from across the region and demonstrated a range of diversity within
the type. Not only are there morphological differences regionally, there can be diversity within a
site as illustrated by the Diamond Knoll (41HS796) Gary point collection (Oksanen 2018).
Factors affecting this variability include the individual skills of those knappers, quality of the
raw resources, use and re-use over time, and social identity (tribal or kin affiliation). The
workability and poor quality of resources would limit the ability to create design standards let
alone the inherent differences between point makers.
The use-life of a point can imply that the repeated sharpening reduces the size; however, other
issues may be at play such as introduction of new technologies. Even with the advent of the bow
and arrow, Gary points persisted temporally. As Oksanen (2018) points out:
Gary points may have been produced to be smaller and lighter, a local adaptation
as arrow points. Without well-stratified archeological deposits and a rich
chronological record, the technological differences cannot be discerned. While
there have been some compelling studies on type variation (e.g., Foxe et al.
2018), it appears to remain inconclusive on fully understanding the factors behind
this vast variability.
Considering the regional issues with variability, mobility, resource availability, and
chronological detail, the Gary occupation at site 41TR203 contributes greatly in understanding
transitional Archaic peoples. Despite the modest sample size of points, the stable, intact nature of

the archeological components at the Mercado site allows a detailed chronology of the type,
resulting in one of the best-dated Gary point assemblages. Whether the occupants of the site
represent local populations, those from the northeast, or people from more central areas of Texas,
they successfully subsisted on large game and mussels on the banks of the West Fork of the
Trinity River for more than a millennium.

Subsistence Strategies

Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups returned to site 41TR203 to procure
and process resources for more than 1,500 years. However, while it is clear these activities were
taking place, the resources that were being exploited and the way they were processed may have
shifted according to seasonality, climate, or as a result of human adaptation in the form of
technological innovations that occurred throughout the siteâs occupational history. Considering
how subsistence strategies shifted or remained static at site 41TR203 over time has the potential
to provide important insight into the lives of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric peoples living in
north-central Texas.
Previously recorded sites located along the West Fork Trinity River do not typically contain
many lithic artifacts, and this is the case at site 41TR203. However, in the absence of large
quantities of lithic artifacts, data pertaining to subsistence strategies can be ascertained through
other methods of analysis, particularly through the analysis of floral and faunal remains. Floral
and faunal remains, both of which are found at macro and micro scales at site 41TR203, were
used to identify what resources were procured and processed at the site over time. Additionally,
the excavation and analysis of burned rock cooking features provided information about how
these resources were being processed.
Analysis of FCR from site 41TR203, the Mercado site, was helpful in understanding the specific
functions of associated features as well as more general trends in subsistence strategies utilized at
this locale from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods. Patterns of commonality and
difference in archeologically recovered FCR describe the re-use of this specific locale for earth
ovens and open hearths from 2740 to 930 yr Cal BP. Beyond the analysis and interpretations

Mercado Site (41TR203)

481

herein, this research may be used to generate ideas for other potentially useful archeological
analyses, or experimental designs, and to establish commonality in protocols for FCR sampling,
terminology, and curation. This chapter defines key terms, methodologies and results of
analyzing approximately 690 fragments of archeologically recovered FCR from site 41TR203.
Parameters of analysis included descriptions of rock type(s), size, colors, fracture patterning,
cumulative weights, and density distributions. The FCR analysis was feature focused, in that
FCR was considered in the context of an associated feature (or associated AU for isolates).
Archeological sampling at site 41TR203 included all observed thermally altered rocks, which
were catalogued by lot, feature, and analytical unit. Feature 10 within AU 1 was a basin-shaped
burned rock cluster of 426 pieces of FCR (weighing 61.93 kg), that was 1.5 m in diameter and
30 cm deep, dating to approximately 1280 to 1050 yr Cal BP. Feature 15, within AU 5,
contained 94 rocks, weighing approximately 24.36 kg. FCR use at site 41TR203 appears to have
increased exponentially over time (see Chapter 12, Figures 12.33 through 12.35). If volumetric
FCR is a measure of subsistence intensity, then subsistence regimes appear to pulse and to
intensify over time, with the most energetically intense episode represented by Feature 10.
In all but a few examples, the FCR appear to represent one limestone outcrop, likely the
Kimamitia, Ft. Worth, or Duck Creek. Mineral inclusions within the FCR fragments include iron,
limonite, and pyrite nodules. An outcrop of the Ft. Worth/Duck Creek interface exists
immediately across the Trinity River from site 41TR203, in between the West Fork of the Trinity
River and present-day Bluff Street. One example of sandstone from an unidentified source is also
among the FCR assemblage.
Social settings for earth oven use include 1) harvesting and bulk-processing of plants with
seasonal high energy stores; 2) preparing a feast for immediate consumption; 3) maximizing fuel
resources by cooking a large amount of food; 4) rendering fat throughout animal flesh cooked
with bones intact; and 5) transforming inedible plant tissues into a palatable and nutritious form
(see Chapter 12).

1. What were the resource opportunities at the site, in addition to mussel shell and
hardwood?
2. Did the available resources differ between occupations?
3. During what seasons was the site inhabited?
4. Did the seasonality change from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric?
There are noted environmental changes represented by the shifting ratios and presence of
identified taxa in AUs 3, 7, and 8, with AU 8 representing the Late Archaic. Their assemblage is
dominated by grassland species such as bison, but with a shift to a more diverse assemblage
during AU 7, which is slightly later during the Late Archaic. There are indicators of nearby
prairie with a successional ecotone of scrub brush and riparian habitats overlapping or adjacent
to the site. By the time of AU 3, representing the Late Prehistoric at 1055 to 930 yr Cal BP, taxa
presence shifted to those species that prefer woodland and some scrub brush and mixed open
habitats. Seasons represented throughout the occupations at the Mercado site span spring,
summer, and fall and tend to exclude winter.
13.9

Faunal Analysis

Faunal remains were the most abundant artifacts recovered at the site. Of these, the diversity was
limited, with a predominance of bison and deer in AUs 6 through 8. The recovery of bison
remains at site 41TR203 is interesting given that, to date, the degree to which bison was a part of
the Late Archaic peopleâs subsistence strategy in this region of north-central Texas is not yet
well defined (Peter and Harrison 2011). Excavations at site 41DL203 (see Figure 13.1) identified
bison remains in scant quantities within all observed Late Archaic components; however, at site
41TR198, located approximately 3.4 km (2.1 mi) downstream from site 41TR203, no bison
remains were identified within the Late Archaic assemblage (Peter and Harrison 2011; Tinsley
and Dayton 2011). Bison availability may have been a factor, but the faunal assemblage at
nearby site 41TR203 contained a significant number of bison as well as white-tailed deer.
Zooarcheological studies conducted during the data recovery phase were designed to determine
species variability, human subsistence strategies, taphonomic processes, and cultural use of bone.

The faunal analysis was conducted by Dr. Jodi Jacobson. Research design questions posited by
Shipp and Jacobson include:
1. Do the changes in faunal assemblages reflect changes in C3 and C4 ecosystems?
2. Are there a significant number of bison remains?
3. How does the number of bison compare to other open prairie style species?
4. Do grassland changes appear to have affected the presence of bison?
5. Do any of the specimens exhibit cut marks?
6. Do the cut marks or other data indicate that the animals were butchered on site or that
they were brought in from elsewhere?
7. Do the various species reflect a broad-spectrum diet?
8. Does the faunal material reflect a specialized use of the site?
9. Are there young animals or teeth that may suggest seasonal occupation of the site? If so,
is there a change in seasonality in the AUs?
10. Do the concentrations of faunal remains reflect different processing activities?
11. Is there evidence of a bone grease processing?
12. Were some of the rock features used for boiling bones to produce bone grease?
13. Was the site near the kill sites of the animals and used as initial processing site, or does
the evidence suggest a post-processing site? Does this differ between AUs?

1. Do the changes in faunal assemblages reflect changes in C3 and C4 ecosystems?
Environmental conditions and species availability within the catchment area of the site altered
over time. The vertebrate faunal assemblages recovered from AUs 1 through 8 provide
collaborative evidence in conjunction with the radiometric dates of paleoenvironmental habitats
that were exploited by the Late Archaic, Late/Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric
inhabitants of site 41TR203. Regarding the radiometric dated geomorphic levels at the site,
stable carbon isotopes reported as Î´13C values, provide information on local vegetation. It has
been recognized for a long time that different groups of plants have significantly diverse
Mercado Site (41TR203)

484

July 2019

pathways of photosynthesis, resulting in a unique chemistry in plant tissues. The two main
pathways are called C3 and C4. C3 plants are woody; most trees and shrubs are C3. C4 plants are
mostly grasses. The C3 and C4 pathways produce different Î´13C signatures. C3 woody plants
have Î´13C values that are less than -19 percent (more negative), and C4 grasses have Î´13C
values that are more than -19 percent (less negative) (OâLeary 1998). Seven AMS radiocarbon
dates of bone collagen from AUs 1 through 8 yielded Î´13C values ranging from -9.1 to -20.5
percent spanning the period 2723 to 956 yr Cal BP (774 BC to AD 994) (see Table 7.5). Based
upon Î´13C values, the earlier Late Archaic components (AUs 7 and 8) had local vegetation
consisting of mixed shrubs-grasses vegetation as evidenced by Î´13C values clustering around 9.1 to -9.5 and also -20.0 to -20.5 from bison and deer collagen. The Late/Transitional Archaic
period vegetation was likely dominated by grassland with deer collagen yielding a Î´13C value of
-20.2. More recently, during the Late Prehistoric, the local vegetation was grassy shrubland as
evidenced by cottontail collagen yielding a Î´13C value of -18.2. The vertebrate faunal
assemblages corraborate these paleoenvironments.
2. Are there a significant number of bison remains?
All of the bison remains were recovered from the Late Archaic components comprised by AUs 6
through 8. The total bison and cf. bison NISP (n = 49) is the largest meat-producing identified
taxon from this component. Its absence in the assemblages for the Late/Transitional Archaic and
Late Prehistoric periods is indicative of its importance in the subsistence of the Late Archaic
period occupants of the site.
3. How does the number of bison compare to other open prairie style species?
The bison NISP (n = 49) compared to other grassland taxa include pronghorn (n = 5) and deer
(n = 67) during the Late Archaic period. The presence of bison and pronghorn are indicative of
predominately grassland habitats while the deer supports a grassland and forest ecotone
environment being present nearby the site during the Late Archaic.

Mercado Site (41TR203)

4. Do grassland changes appear to have affected the presence of bison?
There are noted environmental changes represented by the shifting ratios and presence of
identified taxa noted in the AUs where the amount of bone present exceeds 100 specimens,
which includes AUs 3, 7, and 8. AU 8, representing the Late Archaic, is dominated by grassland
species such as bison, but with a shift to a more diverse assemblage during AU 7 which is
slightly later during the Late Archaic. There are indicators of nearby prairie with a successional
ecotone of scrub brush and riparian habitats overlapping or adjacent to the site. By the time of
AU 3, representing the Late Prehistoric at 1055 to 930 yr Cal BP, taxa presence shifted to those
species that prefer woodland and some scrub brush and mixed open habitats.
The occupation of the Mercado site (until 1050 yr Cal BP) ends just prior to the earliest
occupation of a well-preserved nearby site, Fish Creek Slough (site 41DL436) (see Figure 13.1).
The earliest occupation at Fish Creek Slough is dated to 1270 AD, or approximately 800 yr Cal
BP. In that earliest occupation at the site, bison was present, but minimally (n = 2), with an
increase in the presence of bison by AD 1405 to 1650 and a decreasing in their presence after
AD 1650. The two well-preserved and nearby sites can give a fairly holistic picture of bison
presence and shifting grassland availability from 2645 yr Cal BP to the 19th century.
The faunal evidence suggests a shift or transition from predominately a grassland habitat to a
mixed grassland and forest or ecotone habitat during the end of the Late Archaic into the
Late/Transitional Archaic period. This change from predominately grassland to mixed grassland
and forest appears to have affected the presence of bison and a shift in the subsistence economy
as represented by the later Late/Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric cultural components.
5. Do any specimens exhibit cut marks?
Butchery evidence was limited, although dirt adhering to unwashed bone likely obscured some
cut marks. Regardless, cut marks, minimal chops, and breakage of bone with a hammerstone
(percussion points) were evident, and browning at some break points may have indicated
localized heating of bone with hot rocks to make breakage of the bone easier. Spiral fractures
were predominantly noted on long bones consistent with breakage for the extraction of marrow.
Mercado Site (41TR203)

486

July 2019

There was no pattern suggesting an increase or decrease in marrow extraction overtime, and
there is no direct evidence of processing bone to extract grease at the site.
6. Do cut marks or other data indicate that the animals were butchered on site or were
brought to the site from elsewhere?
Skeletal part frequencies for AU 8, Late Archaic, indicate nearby kill and onsite consumption.
However, skeletal part frequency analysis for both bison and deer for AU 7, Late Archaic, and
for deer for AU 3, Late Prehistoric, would indicate that while the animal was killed near the site,
and some initial processing for meat removal and marrow extraction occurred at the site,
elements with high and middle meat utility may have been transported to the site from other kill
loci through schlepping.
7. Do the various species reflect a broad-spectrum diet?
The diverse faunal assemblage recovered from the Late Archaic (AUs 6 through 8) component
suggests a broad-spectrum subsistence strategy. However, the paucity of fish, amphibians,
reptiles, and birds suggests these taxa are likely intrusive to the cultural deposits or were
acquired opportunistically if readily available by the siteâs occupants. It likely that many of these
smaller remains were simply not recovered in the Â¼-inch screen. In contrast, the larger game that
includes bison, deer, and pronghorn, appear to reflect a focal hunting strategy of large game,
with hunting forays on short trips to surrounding areas, and the kill sites being elsewhere. The
presence of most of the siteâs lagomorph (n = 39) remains also from the Late Archaic component
suggests these smaller game animals were probably acquired opportunistically.
8. Do the vertebrate faunal remains reflect a specialized use of the site?
The vertebrate faunal assemblage from the Mercado site strongly suggests the site was used as a
semi-permanent seasonal camp by its prehistoric occupants, spanning the Late Archaic,
Late/Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. The Late Archaic component,
represented by AUs 6 through 8, represents a base camp where the high-meat yielding elements
from large game (bison, deer, and pronghorn) that were killed elsewhere were being returned for
Mercado Site (41TR203)

487

July 2019

further processing and consumption. The Late/Transitional Archaic occupation, represented by
AUs 4 and 5, is characterized by shell middens (see Chapter 10). The vertebrate faunal
assemblage is indicative of a focal subsistence centered on the harvesting and processing
mollusks from the West Fork of the Trinity River. The Late Prehistoric component, represented
by AUs 1 through 3, has a limited variety of taxa, with an emphasis upon deer (n = 86). The deer
elements are indicative of hunting forays into the nearby deciduous forests and schlepping the
higher meat yielding elements back to the Mercado site for further processing and consumption.
9. Does the assemblage suggest seasonal occupation of the site? If so, do the AUs reflect
changes in seasonality?
The occurrence of amphibians and reptiles in the Late Archaic assemblage, AUs 6 through 8, is
indicative of spring through fall use of the site when these taxa would have been active. There is
no direct evidence of a winter or cold weather occupation of the site. Indirect evidence of a fall
occupation is illustrated by the dominance of bison, deer, and pronghorn. Traditionally, among
Plains Tribes, fall hunting forays were pursued prior to the winter months, when the large game
animals were most fit with regards to their meat value and condition of their hides for making
clothing and shelters. Consequently, an apparent focus on hunting large game animals indirectly
supports a fall occupation of the site.
10. Do the concentrations of faunal remains reflect different processing activities?
The vertebrate faunal remains do not reflect different processing activities. A large part of the
assemblage is fragmented as a result of probable processing of bone marrow. The fragmentation
of predominately the long bones appears to have occurred during both the Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric occupations of the site. The paucity of vertebrate faunal remains from the
Late/Transitional Archaic period occupation of the site does not permit reflecting upon this, since
the component is dominated by shell middens.

Mercado Site (41TR203)

488

July 2019

11. Is there evidence of bone grease processing?
The types and amount of fragmentation of bones were examined and recorded. Extensive
fragmentation of larger bones is typically indicative of heavy processing for marrow and bone
grease. Smashing of long bones of medium mammals and larger was common amongst most
Great Plains groups for the extraction of marrow and bone grease (Kehoe and Kehoe 1960;
White 1953, 1954, 1955). General observations during analysis were that for bison, deer, and
pronghorn, some long bones with higher utility based on marrow content had been fractured, but
the bone does not appear to have been smashed for bone grease extraction. In addition, while
most of the long bones such as femurs, humeri, tibias, radii, and metapodials have been broken
for marrow, phalanges had not been intentionally broken.
12. Were any of the rock features used for boiling bones to produce bone grease?
Some of the rock features may have been used to prepare bone grease; however, general
observations during analysis were that for bison, deer, and pronghorn. Some long bones with
higher utility based on marrow content had been fractured, but the bone does not appear to have
been smashed for bone grease extraction.
13. Was the site near the kill sites of the animals and used as an initial processing site, or
does the evidence suggest a post-processing site? Does this differ between AUs?
The general absence or paucity of low-meat yielding elements of bison, deer, and pronghorn
suggests the kill sites were likely near the Mercado site and the highest meat-yielding elements
of the butchered game was returned, or schlepped, back to the site for further preparation for
consumption. Differences in the processing of the larger game animals between the Late Archaic
(AUs 6 through 8) and the Late Prehistoric (AUs 1 through 3) do not appear. The paucity of
vertebrate faunal remains from the Late/Transitional Archaic period (AUs 4 and 5) does not
permit comparisons with the preceding Late Archaic or the subsequent Late Prehistoric period
occupations.

13.10 Paleoenvironment
Table 13.12 summarizes the preferred habitats of the identified taxa recovered from AUs 6, 7,
and 8, which represent the Late Archaic occupation at site 41TR203. The identified taxa
represent all available local habitats and environs that include aquatic, riparian, grassland,
deciduous forest, and culturally modified landscapes. Since the Late Archaic occupants of the
Mercado site unlikely were engaging in agricultural activities, agricultural fields are unlikely to
have existed as a habitat for those taxa, but they are mentioned and included as a basis for
possible early agricultural pursuits along the West Fork of the Trinity River. Bison, deer, and
pronghorn, the largest game animals, also having the highest meat value, were undoubtedly the
focal subsistence taxa hunted by the site occupants during this period. Based on the elements
present in the assemblage, local individuals were likely hunted opportunistically while more
oftentimes the animal kill sites were some distance from site 41TR203, and the high meat value
elements were returned, or schlepped back, to the site for further processing. Expansive
grasslands with deciduous forests along the river would be expected to be dominant during this
period. Precipitation and temperatures were ideal for maintaining the grassland and mixed
deciduous forest habitats and ecotones, which has supportive evidence in the presence of aquatic
and riparian taxa also represented in the assemblage.

The large and medium-large vertebrate fauna that are prevalent during the preceding Late
Archaic period (see above) are surpassed by the presence of shell middens during the
Late/Transitional Archaic period (see Chapter 10). This major shift in subsistence and
procurement strategies may be associated with climatic events that altered the preferred habitats
of grazers and browsers such as the bison, deer, and pronghorn. Or, there was a shift in
subsistence preferences that emphasized exploitation of mollusks in the West Fork of the Trinity
River. Given the presence of the shell middens, the river must have had a reliable water flow that
provided an ideal habitat for large numbers of mollusks.
Table 13.14 summarizes the identified taxa and their preferred habitats for AUs 1, 2, and 3 which
represent the Late Prehistoric occupation of site 41TR203. The limited taxa indicate habitats
consisting of mixed deciduous forest and grassland with riparian also represented. There are no
aquatic vertebrate taxa and only medium-large (i.e., deer) and small (i.e., cottontail, cotton rat,
wood rat) are represented. The cottontail and deer would have been attracted to agricultural
fields if they existed. These taxa were likely hunted opportunistically when they entered the
vicinity of the Mercado site.

The oldest levels dating to 2740 to 2350 yr Cal BP (AUs 7 and 8) were dominated by grassland,
especially bison, and other open or edge species with moderate supplemental use of aquatic
species. After a very minimal presence of bison represented by fragmented teeth in AU 6 at
approximately 2345 to 2145 yr Cal BP, there is a complete absence of bison, bovid, or even large
artiodactyl bone in any of the AUs 1 through 5 assemblages. Given the dominance of bison in the
diet when available, this absence suggests bison no longer occurred within the site catchment
area for the site after 2000 yr Cal BP represented by AU 7, there is an absence of any vertebrate
aquatic habitat species, which is interesting given the proximity of the West Fork of the Trinity
River. This coincides with the introduction of shell midden assemblages and may simply signify
a shift from vertebrate to invertebrate aquatic resources. Most of the aquatic species utilized,
such as beaver, ducks, turtles, and catfish, would tend to prefer slower moving or ponded waters
such as a slough, oxbow, or slow meander. The shift in subsistence at this time may also indicate
a change in the riverine environment as well, and the mussel shell assemblage provides
information pertinent to the type of aquatic environment represented by those species during
later occupations (see Chapter 10).

13.11 Subsistence Strategies
It is hard to discuss accurate usage of aquatic resources without the complimentary information
on findings regarding the mollusk analysis, but it appears only the earliest assemblage, AU 8 of
the Late Archaic period, focused on the use of aquatic resources. Additionally, those resources
seem to either have been hunted (e.g., beaver and ducks) or gathered (e.g., turtles), with only
minimal fishing occurring as only one catfish bone was identified in the assemblage. Shifts after
2,000 years ago suggest a reliance on deer after which there is little diversity in the
Late/Transitional Archaic and Late Prehistoric assemblages.
13.12 Taphonomy
The preservation of bone at site 41TR203 is unique for North Texas assemblages of its age. A
few factors likely contributed to the siteâs preservation, including rapid sedimentation and burial
of material, likely from flood events of the West Fork of the Trinity River, and the substantial
use of mussel shell which, due to its calcareous nature, can alter soils to be less acidic and allow
for better bone preservation. There was substantial dry bone breakage at the site, but most bone
was not heavily weathered, and fragments tended to be larger than smaller, still in good
condition, and not brittle. There was some evidence for rodent gnawing and carnivore
consumption (puncture and digestive erosion), but its presence is minimal considering the
amount of bone recovered. Overall, few sites in Texas could come close to a similar level of
preservation as the Mercado site.
13.13 Cultural Use of Bone
North Texas and the region surrounding Tarrant and Dallas Counties tend to be poor in high
quality lithic resources. Expedient bone tools have been noted at other sites in the region, such as
Fish Creek Sough (site 41DL436) (see Figure 13.1), and were noted here at the Mercado site
(41TR203) as well. When processing bone for marrow, breaks tend to be sharp. Although they
may become dull over time and deposition, the working edges generally are retained with an
angled edge, yet some bones in the assemblage exhibited both a polish from being held, used,
and worn, with abraded edges being sharp as they should be. Bone unlike stone, cannot easily be

re-sharpened, so once becoming dull through use, most bone tools would have been discarded. In
addition to the expedient bone tool presence, there were a couple of long bone fragments that had
been incised, although the bone was too fragmentary to better identify the taxon or the tools
function. Sites should be more closely assessed to look at seeming raw bone for potential cultural
modifications to glean a better picture of expedient bone tool use in addition to other cultural use
of bone.
The unique preservation and large faunal assemblage from the Mercado site have provided
knowledge about cultural lifeways, prehistoric human ecology, and environmental conditions
spanning approximately 2740 to 930 yr Cal BP at the Mercado site in north-central Texas along
the West Fork of the Trinity River. This information helps to fill a void where there has been
little direct knowledge of subsistence and paleoenvironmental data for this region of Texas
during this timeframe.
13.14 Mussel Shell
Mussel shell was present within all AUs at the site but was by far the predominant artifact
category in AUs 4 and 5. This phenomenon is addressed below in regards to resource availability
and climatic factors.
Mussel shell represents a non-repetitive element that can be identified to the lowest taxon
possible (often species in well-preserved assemblages). This reveals the mussel community
structure harvested. Using the program UNIO by Robert Warren, the riverine habitat the shell
was harvested from was estimated. When possible, shell lengths were measured as a proxy for
age, enabling species-specific age histograms to be generated. Depending on the stratification of
the assemblage, potential harvest pressure though time can be assessed by evaluating shifts in the
age structure. While identifying the shell, signs of burning, raccoon predation, and tooling were
also noted. By quantifying the shell, the relative abundance of the mussel community being
harvested can be determined in addition to the likely habitat of the river from which these
mussels were collected., and potentially the harvest pressure on this mussel community.

Approximately 50 percent of the total mussel shell assemblage was analyzed by Traci Popejoy,
who was guided by the sampling strategies of Woo et al. (2015) and Cambell (2017). Research
questions that she sought to address include:
1. Are the mussel species in AUs 4 and 5 different than the other AUs?
2. Is there tooling evidence on the shells?
3. Where the shells harvested on a regular basis?
4. What was the riverine habitat the shells were collected from, and did it change between
AUs?
5. Do changes in stable carbon isotopes correlate with changes in grassland types?
Popejoy utilized Dr. Robert Warrenâs program, UNIO, to determine the volume of mussel
species remains. UNIO also helped to recreate the prehistoric riverine environment by looking at
what species prefers water depth, current velocity, substrate composition, and the preferred
habitat of the mussels. Additionally, while analyzing the freshwater mussels, tooling evidence
was a subject of identification; however, no quantifiable tooling evidence was discovered during
the analysis of the mussels.
The UNIO program generated results for the freshwater mussel assemblage that was analyzed
from site 41TR203. The analysis concluded that the mussels were adapted to a small river with
shallow waters that are less than 1.5 m in depth. The primary substrate composition relating the
mussel assemblage preferred small gravel and sand substrates with a variable current velocity.
The shallow depth of where the mussels occupy within the river may have been an indicator of
an opportunistic subsistence strategy performed by prehistoric people. The four tribes
(Pleurobemini, Quadrulini, Amblemin, and Lampsilini) outlined in the analysis were commonly
found within all the AUs. Of the eight AUs that were defined at site 41TR403, AU 4 (1710 to
1415 yr Cal BP) had the highest concentration of shell. A comparison between AU 5 (1815 to
1570 yr Cal BP) and AU 4 shows a dramatic increase of shell represented within AU 4. The
variety of tribes found within AU 4 and AU 5 is relatively consistent, with Pleurobemini being
the most prevalent tribe, followed by Quadrulini, Amblemini, and then Lampsilini with the
lowest volume within site 41TR203.
Mercado Site (41TR203)

Mussel harvesting was practiced on a recurrent basis throughout all AUs at site 41TR203,
indicating that the riverine habitat stayed consistent throughout the prehistoric cultural
occupations. Although, the spike of exploiting mussels within AUs 4 and 5 may indicate a
climatic shift in the surrounding area to a more arid grassland environment. The shift would have
modified the larger fauna patterns and in turn would have resulted in the necessity to exploit the
mussels on a larger scale for sustenance. Thus, mussels fit the definition of a âstressâ food that
was exploited in times of necessity. The analysis had no definitive evidence supporting seasonal
occupation.
13.15 Botanical Remains
The botanical analysis was conducted by Dr. Leslie Bush, who helped define the subsistence
strategies of the prehistoric people at the archeological site 41TR203. No charred seeds were
recovered, only wood charcoal and two charred bulb fragments. The research questions
regarding botanical remains and subsistence strategies are:
1. What plants were processed at the site?
The light fraction remains of the flotation process brought several species of plants that were
harvested and prepared from the local area by the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric huntergatherer groups. The notable species of organic materials that were identified during the analysis
consisted of goosefoot seed (Chenopodium sp.), stick-tight seed (Galium sp.), acorn caps
(Quercus sp.), and acorn nutshells (Quercus sp.). Goosefoot seeds and the acorns found within
features may indicate a food resource that was harvested and baked within the features. The
stick-tight seeds are commonly known to have burs and were most likely taken from clothing or
animals during the preparation phase of the baking and thrown into the feature to be disposed.
The stick-tight âseedâ is common in modern vegetation throughout riparian zones and produce
fruits between March and May (Diggs 2006). Inferring the month range of when stick-tight is
most commonly occurring seasonally may give an indication of what months the camp site may
have been occupied in the past.

2. What type of wood was burned as fuel in hearth features?
3. Are these wood types present in the modern vegetation?
A side-by-side comparison of the fuel sources throughout the AUs demonstrate that the wood
charcoal remains stay consistent throughout time and that the likelihood of the vegetation was
the same throughout the different occupational zones from the Late Archaic to the Late
Prehistoric. The fuel types present within the analysis listed are common species found in the
modern vegetation of the site that consists of primarily oaks (Quercus sect. Quercus; Quercus
spp; Quercus sect. Lobatae), elm (Ulmus spp.), plum/cherry (Prunus spp.), blackhaw (Viburnum
cf. rufidulum), hickory/pecan (Carya spp.), boxelder (Acer negundo), ash (Fraxinus spp.), and
the legume family (Fabaceae; most likely honeylocust or redbud). The species of wood
described above are used as fuel for the earthen ovens and oak wood is regularly linked with
burned rock cooking due to oak producing hot temperatures and ideal coals for baking (Collier
and Turner 1981; Marcouiller and Anderson n.d.).
4. What types of vegetation were located at the site throughout the Late Archaic occupation
to the Late Prehistoric occupation, and do these differ?
5. Do the plants reflect seasonal use of the site?
6. How does this floral assemblage compare to other regional sites?
Two important conclusions were found through the botanical analysis that demonstrate the use of
the burned rock features and support the activity areas of the occupational zones of the site. The
example comes from AU 1 (1280 to 970 yr Cal BP) of Feature 10, where a charred plant bulb
scale fragment was recovered in the flotation sample. The plant bulb was most likely wild onion
or camas that was baked in the large earthen oven that is described as Feature 10. The other
valued supporting evidence comes from AU 4 (1710 to 1415 yr Cal BP) of Feature 26. Feature
26 was an anomalous defined feature of mostly shell. However, the botanical remains included
another charred bulb fragment, 4 acorn nutshell fragments, 11 acorn cap fragments, 3 goosefoot
seeds, and a stick-tight seed, all of which may indicate a portion of the prehistoric peopleâs diet.
The indication of the plant bulb fragments found within earthen oven Feature 10 and Feature 26

can be extrapolated to understand the functions of the other burned rock features found within
other AUs at the site.
13.16 Burned Rock Features
Rock features were the most common feature type at the site and ranged from small basin hearths
to burned rock middens. The ways in which people were processing plant and animal resources
using burned rock features provide insight into subsistence strategies beyond simply identifying
what resources were being exploited. The rock features potentially provide information
concerning what level of effort and innovation went into processing the resources and help
further our understanding of plant and animal processing in this region during the Late Archaic
period. Burned rock feature analysis focused on questions such as:
1. What types of resources were processed in each feature?
2. What types of burned rock features are present?
3. What sorts of scenarios occurred to create the archeological remains?
4. Were both plants and animals processed at the site in these features?
5. Are some of the rocks boiling stones?
6. Are the rock features typical of other Late Archaic rock features both inside and outside
of the region?
7. Do rock sizes indicate feature use?
Burned rock feature morphology, technology and utilization was consistent throughout the Late
Archaic and Late/Transitional Archaic periods but may have been more focused during the Late
Prehistoric Interval. During the Late Archaic Interval at site 41TR203, (approximately 2700 to
2100 yr Cal BP), broad spectrum exploitation of available resources is indicated centered on
hunting of large mammals including bison and deer, as well as of numerous small mammals, and
included riverbank and riverine resources. AUs 6 through 8 appear to represent a relatively stable
or slowly aggrading landform where multiple aboriginal groups camped throughout an
approximate 600-year time span, leaving a sheet midden (Feature 20) of subsistence debris
including FCR, mussels, animal bone, stone tools, and charred fuel woods. Several elements of

Mercado Site (41TR203)

499

July 2019

bison and deer bones were located in feature contexts. Faunal studies may indicate that bison
kills were conducted off site and portable portions were brought back to site 41TR203 for further
processing and consumption. Mussel shell was common in the sheet midden. Burned rock
features included earth oven basal and lid rock elements, small basin-shaped hearths, rockless
pits, and simple discard piles, all abandoned on a stable occupation surface resulting in the mix
of cultural deposits.
At least one large earth oven is identified in the AU 8 sediments based on multiple lines of
archeological data, including feature forms, test unit data, photographs, drawings, rock size and
weight information, and associated artifacts. Feature 20.1 appears to represent the remnant of a
basal heating element to an earth oven, and associated rake-out or discard pile (see Chapter 7).
Larger rocks in a relatively tight concentration are present at the south end of the documented
extent of the feature, in association with bison teeth. The rocks present as a dense layer of larger,
less fractured FCR in a compact arrangement. These exhibit the appearance of the rock lined
basal elements of an earth oven (Black et al. 1997; Black et al 1998; Black and Thoms 2014),
and the rocks to the north a possible oven lid rock or rake-out pile. The lid rock or rake-out pile
consisted of smaller, more highly fractured rocks, in a scattered arrangement, both at the same
elevation.
Feature 20.1 was excavated from Block A within Units 18, 19, 22, and 23 at 110 to 117 cmbs
(99.06 to 98.99). Feature 20.1 measured approximately 135 cm north-south, 115 cm east-west,
and 10 cm thick. Feature size, rock size, and rock weight information suggest a possible earth
oven. This is supported by the fact that the larger and heavier rocks are present in the tight
cluster. A total of 22 FCR weighing 1.25 kilograms was collected from the feature. Most of the
rocks were in one layer, some in two layers, and varied from 3 to 12 cm in size and were flat to
subangular. Some of the rocks were fractured in-situ. The profile was a very shallow basin,
almost flat. From the Feature 20.1 drawing, mussel shell and bone are present in the lid rock
scatter, and bone in the tight cluster, but no mussel is observed within the larger rock cluster.
Additionally, 63 faunal specimens from large mammals (bison or elk size) were recovered and
analyzed.

Mercado Site (41TR203)

Numerous smaller basin-shaped hearth features are documented in the Late Archaic deposits
(AUs 6 through 8). Features 32, 42, and 43 represent small circular clusters of larger, less
fractured rocks, dug into basins often consisting of 2 to 3 rock layers, with the largest rocks
typically at the bottom (see Chapter 7). Photographs and plan and profile drawings (see Chapter
7) indicate Features 42 and 43 consist of tight clusters of FCR with several layers and the largest
rocks in a shallow basin at the bottom the features. In both features, charcoal and/or clay or
mussel are embedded in the matrix of the feature, between and under the rocks. Select features
were subject to collection and burned rock size and weight measurements. Feature 42 feature
contained 42 FCR weighing 12.72 kg. While FCR size and weight data are unavailable, Feature
43 consisted of approximately 50 pieces of FCR arranged in a rough circle measuring
approximately 50 cm north-south, 50 cm east-west, and 15 cm thick. The base of the feature was
basin-shaped, with a dense layer of burned earth and charcoal at the bottom. Feature 32 is
interpreted to represent a small basin-shaped hearth feature. It included 64 FCR weighing 13.72
kg. Feature 32 and Feature 42 contained some of the largest numbers of the largest rocks (7 to 10
cm in size), and largest weight of rocks of features at the site.
Numerous FCR features in the Late Archaic deposits are ambiguous to morphology or function.
These consist of loose scatters of smaller, highly cracked, and fractured FCR that are only
roughly circular in shape, or not circular, do not exhibit any basin shape in profile view, are
typically one layer of rocks thick, and that contain numerous types of artifacts and faunal
remains. In the Late Archaic zone, this includes Features 18, 30, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, and 44.
These types of FCR features are posited as possible scattered hearth remnants, or rakeout/discard piles from earth ovens, or simply dumps of nearby cultural activities, and which
contribute to the overall sheet midden effect.
Additional rock feature types in the Late Archaic occupations (AUs 6 through 8) include unlined,
charcoal-stained, ash and baked clay cooking pits, and scatters of mussel shell and FCR.
Feature 19 was a dense concentration of burned earth, some in nodules and some in large angular
pieces, as well as charcoal, and FCR (see Chapter 7). Feature 6 was a cluster of FCR with smears
of charcoal and baked earth identified in BHT 2 during the testing phase. Mapped materials

Mercado Site (41TR203)

501

included FCR, mussel shell, baked earth, and charcoal. Feature 24 was a dense concentration of
ash and burned earth that appeared to be a cooking pit. The feature was excavated from Block C
in Units 43, 47, and 58 at 131 cmbs. The feature was excavated on its 90-cm-long north-south
axis and measured approximately 30 cm wide and 30 cm thick. There was a burned rim around
the top of the feature, and several large chunks of ash within, and numerous faunal remains.
Feature 40 was an amorphous concentration of shell and small FCR (less than 5 cm) located
adjacent to areas of charcoal staining and burned earth.
Late/Transitional Archaic burned rock features are basically the same, only with no positive rock
evidence of large earth oven construction and use. Yet there are some indications of earth oven
use and plant food processing in the recovered macrobotanical remains from AU 4. In addition,
there appears to be more of an emphasis on mussel exploitation, still within a broad-based
resource exploitation system. The Late/Transitional Archaic deposits (AUs 4 and 5) are of a
much lesser density than the Late Archaic occupations (AUs 6 through 8) and appear to represent
an approximate 400-year time span (1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP). The Late/Transitional Archaic
occupation zone also accumulated during a period of slower sedimentation, according to the
age-sedimentation model, but over a shorter period of time. Thus, the features in the
Late/Transitional Archaic are likely to be less culturally overprinted and more representative of
short periods or short-lived events. Stable carbon isotope ratios from radiocarbon assays on
sediment samples indicate a trend toward a more xeric environment and dominated by C3 plant
communities, with increased sediment aggradation and good preservation of the buried cultural
deposits.
Feature 15 was a dense concentration of rocks that was possibly a hearth, oven remnant, or oven
lid rock pile. Only scant information is available on the feature. Feature 15 exhibited one of the
highest rock counts and weights in the deposits, with 94 FCR weighing approximately 24.36 kg.
The count and weight are suggestive of an earth oven basal remnant, but there is no other
information about the size, shape, rock layering, and rock types/sizes. Earth ovens are typically
associated with plant food processing, although well understood to have processed a broad
spectrum of resources. One ground stone metate fragment (in four non-conjoining pieces) was

Mercado Site (41TR203)

502

July 2019

recovered in the AU 4 deposits. Metates are typically associated with the grinding of plant foods
and plant food processing in earth ovens (Black et al. 1997; Black et al 1998; Black and
Thoms 2014). There are also several examples of ambiguous FCR features also in the
Late/Transitional Archaic deposits. These include Feature 1 and Feature 5, and are identified
only as a range of possible feature types including displaced hearths, small ovens, lid rock/rakeout piles, or discard heaps, containing various lithics, faunal materials, and mussel shell (see
Chapter 7). Similar to the deeper, Late Archaic occupation zone, the Late/Transitional zone
exhibited a variety of rockless cooking pits and features consisting of charcoal stained earth and
baked sediment (Features 16, 17, 27, and 31).
In the Late/Transitional Archaic sediments, Features 14, 21, 25, 26, and 28 are mussel shell
middens, mussel shell concentrations, mussel shell scatters depending upon, size, density and
depth. All were ubiquitous with numerous different types of mussel, mammal bones and charcoal
(see Chapter 7). Feature 26 is notable for containing a charred bulb scale fragment along with
other charred plant food remains (4 acorn nutshell fragments, 11 acorn cap fragments, 3
goosefoot seeds, see Appendix B). With preparation, some of these represent possibly utilized
plant foods. The bulb is an indication that wild onions or camas were processed and consumed
during this occupation. Camas bulbs were often prepared in Late Archaic, Late/Transitional
Archaic, and Late Prehistoric contexts in an earth oven (Black et al. 1997; Black et al 1998;
Black and Thoms 2014, see below). Thus, Feature 26 may represent the spilled out or dumped
contents of an earth oven, complete with mussel shell. Feature 14 was a midden of mussel shells
and other artifacts measuring approximately 3 m eastâwest by 1.5 m northâsouth and 20 cm
thick.
Assuming an adequate sample of the Late Prehistoric deposits (AUs 1 through 3), burned rock
midden technology was focused on the manufacture and use of earth ovens and earth oven
cooking (Black et al. 1997; Black et al 1998; Black and Thoms 2014), supplemented with small
basin-shaped hearths for food processing, warmth, and other utilities. The Late Prehistoric zone
lacked mussel shell features, and based on faunal remains, was heavily focused on hunting deer,
and other mammals, small and large, within a broad-based generalized exploitation system. The

Mercado Site (41TR203)

503

July 2019

Late Prehistoric interval was a period of more xeric conditions (C3 plant communities), more
rapid sedimentation, increased aggradation of the terrace deposits, and excellent site
preservation.
Feature 10 resembles an oval basin pit that is approximately 140 cm north-south by 120 cm
east-west, and 15 cm thick. This feature had the most collected burned rock specimen of all the
features excavated with 426 specimens, weighing approximately 61.93 kg. Feature 10 is also the
largest burned rock feature excavated at site 41TR203. The feature was bisected along its middle
axis and the cross-section showed the feature to consist of a shallow basin containing a dense,
compact layer of large burned rocks representing the basal rock heating elements of an earth
oven (see Chapter 7). Burned rock and burned earth nodules in adjacent Units 30 and 31 may
represent the partial clean-out of the feature. Charcoal flecking was ubiquitous, and large pieces
of charred branches were located at the bottom of the basin. Two sediment matrix samples were
processed from Feature 10 to recover macrobotanical remains (see Appendix B). At 0.14 grams
per liter (g/l), the density of plant material was relatively high in this feature (site average = 0.06
g/l). It is one of two features where a bulb scale fragment was recovered, indicating that bulbs
such as wild onion or camas were cooked during this site occupation (see Feature 26 above). Ten
faunal remains from small mammals were collected from the feature. The density, size,
arrangement, and presence of a rock-lined basin of larger unfractured rocks, along with organic
remains, suggest that Feature 10 is a larger earth oven with its lower heating elements still intact
(see Chapter 7).
Features 8 and 12, in the Late Prehistoric deposits, fit into that amorphous category of possibly a
hearth remnant, oven remnant, lid rock/rake-out pile, or simply a dump/discard pile. Feature 13
is a well-documented small basin-shaped hearth or small earth oven. The feature was in a figure
8 shape, approximately 80 cm in diameter, and 15 cm thick (Unit 10, AU 3). A dense cluster of
approximately 50 FCR was fractured in-situ in two and three flat layers. The basin-shaped
nature, the bed of larger rocks in the lower basin, and the loose smaller FCR covering the lower
bed are suggestive of a small earth oven. The loose smaller rocks may represent lid rocks from

Mercado Site (41TR203)

504

July 2019

the upper elements of a small-sized oven. Alternatively, the remains of a small hearth feature
may be indicated.
The same feature types are present throughout the terrace deposits during the Late Archaic,
Late/Transitional Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods, only in differing densities, and states of
cultural overprinting or preservation. Archaic burned rock cooking, burned rock technologies,
earth oven cookery, small hearths, and rockless pits (from which foodstuffs, fuel, and FCR were
removed) were all utilized to process a great variety of resources, including bison and deer, a
diversity of smaller mammals, and river margin and riverine resources, including numerous
species of mussels and plant foods (Black et al. 1997; Black et al 1998; Black and Thoms 2014).
The presence of a metate fragment and the morphology of Feature 10, and the recovery of a
charred bulb scale fragment (potentially wild onion or camas) are robust indications of the
processing of plant foods as well as the presence of other charred plant remains. Plant food
processing can be inferred if not demonstrated by the presence of similar FCR features in
different contexts at the site (Black et al. 1997; Black et al 1998; Black and Thoms 2014). Stone
boiling is possible and cannot be eliminated at the site, but there is no direct evidence of this.
Detailed rock size, rock type, and rock weights within the context of plan and profile feature
drawings, photographs, mapping, and sampling can definitely be interpreted to determine feature
use, type, and function. But these data sets are lacking consistency in the site records and do not
represent a robust and reliable data set from which to make these inferences at site 41TR203.
The different types of features and cultural remains were variably dispersed in well-preserved
archeological contexts as sheet middens, shell middens, earth oven and hearth feature remnants,
lid rock/rake-out piles, dumps, and discard piles (Black et al. 1997; Black et al 1998; Black and
Thoms 2014). The types of features observed at site 41TR203 are common and not unique in the
north-central Texas archeological record.
13.17 Lithic Technology
The amount of lithic material recovered from the Mercado site was sparse, as is the case with
most of the sites in the region during these periods. However, there were lithics recovered from

Mercado Site (41TR203)

505

July 2019

all AUs, including 12 projectile points. The lithics were analyzed according to TxDOT protocols.
Research questions regarding lithic material include:
1. Are there distinct lithic assemblages within each AU? How do they vary?
2. What types of stone tool are present within each AU?
3. What types of raw material were being used?
4. What percentage of the lithic material was heat-treated?
Overall, the Mercado site (41TR203) exhibits a low-density stone tool collection with few formal
tools consistent with several other sites in the north-central Texas archeological region
(Prikryl 1990; Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner et al. 2002). There is very little basis for comparison
between the three different occupation zones (Late Prehistoric, Late/Transitional Archaic, Late
Archaic) due to the sparse nature of the uppermost assemblages. Recovery is sparse in the Late
Prehistoric period (1250 to 250 yr Cal BP). A total of eight flakes and one unifacial fragment
were recovered from AUs 1 through 3. These consist of three whole flakes and five flake
fragments. From direct observation, chert material types in AUs 1 through 3 include fine-grained
gray, dark gray, tan, tan and gray banded, and dark tan/brown. These are all very similar in
nature with little variation in material type, only slight variations in color. Also present is one
very small flake on coarse grained black material. The presence of a uniface tool is consistent
with the significant recovery of deer bone and other mammal bone in Late Prehistoric feature
contexts and may reflect hide scraping, although the tool is small and seemingly expedient in
nature. No flakes were recorded as exhibiting cortex. None of the flakes are recorded as
thermally altered.
Twenty-two pieces of debitage were recovered in the Late/Transitional Archaic collection. This
small number is likely partly due to sample size and the targeting of the rich Late Archaic zone at
the site during the course of the field investigations. One ground stone metate fragment was
recovered in four small pieces. Although the pieces do not conjoin, the material of the four
elements is identical in terms of abrasive surface, likely sandstone, and the presence of a
grinding facet on one side, in the same location; therefore, these may represent the same artifact.
The presence of a grinding stone is unique in the site assemblage and consistent with the use and
Mercado Site (41TR203)

506

July 2019

construction of earth ovens and plant food processing that is presumed to have occurred
throughout the site history. Debitage is counted as 10 whole flakes and 12 flake fragments.
Represented are several different chert material types. These include fine grained tan, brown,
tan/brown, tan/brown banded, gray and pink. Fine grained tans and grays were most common.
Also present are coarse grained gray and brown chert material types. The similarity in material
types is suggestive of utilization of local, small cobbles for bifacial thinning. The small
collection is equally divided between large 1-in and 3/4-in size flakes (sieves), and small
pressure flakes (1/4-in sieve). Though only a few flakes, initial stage reduction and later stage
sharpening and resharpening of probable bifacial tools and projectile points is indicated. The
occupations in AUs 4 and 5 include broad spectrum small mammal and riverine resource
exploitation (mussel shell). No flakes are recorded as exhibiting cortex. None of the flakes are
recorded as thermally altered.
A significant lithic assemblage was collected from the Late Archaic occupation in AUs 6 through
8. The assemblage contains 20 of the 22 stone tools and 349 of the 390 flakes recovered at the
Mercado site (41TR203). Gary projectile points are considered diagnostic of the Late Archaic
period and are consistent in age with the proposed 2700 to 2100 yr Cal BP timeframe of AUs 6
through 8 (see Chapter 9). Five projectile points in the collection are considered Gary darts. One
is an unidentified Late Archaic point. One projectile resembles an Ensor or Ellis dart with an
associated time range of 2200 to 1400 yr Cal BP which is consistent with the Late Archaic site
deposits. Five dart points are unidentified, two of which are broad-bladed, which is a trait of Late
Archaic lithic technology. One of these may represent a projectile broken during the later or last
stages of manufacture and thinning. All of the other darts are utilized, heavily resharpened
projectiles (see Chapter 11).
Six small bifaces and four small unifaces are present in the collection. The biface fragments are
small, crude, and trend toward indicating the expedient use of available materials. The unifaces
are all small, flake unifaces. Similar to the bifaces in the collection, all are small pieces that
would be navigable between two fingers for focused scraping activities. All four unifacial pieces
exhibit one apparent âworkedâ edge, from simple observation, and is difficult to determine

whether these four represent intentional alteration or more-so expedient tools with edge damage
from use.
In terms of debitage, larger flakes (1-in, 3/4-in sieves) were present in the Late Archaic
assemblage and represent initial-stage thinning and tool manufacture primarily with fist-size or
smaller cores. In addition, the smallest pressure flakes and biface thinning flakes (1/4-in sieve)
representing final stage sharpening and resharpening predominated in the Late Archaic
assemblage both in terms of whole flakes and flake fragments (see Chapter 9, Table 9.2). Many
of these larger flakes exhibited extensive cortex. Flakes with cortex were common in the sheet
midden of cultural debris that represents AUs 6 through 8 (approximately 30 percent). Only a
very small number of the whole flakes and flake fragments are recorded as thermally altered.
There was no evidence of larger cores, fist-sized or larger cores, or core fragments in the site as a
whole, nor in the Late Archaic interval. Core reduction occurred with easily transported
materials or small cobbles in the immediate vicinity. These aspects may indicate that later stage
thinning and sharpening in support of tool production and the resharpening of utilized tools were
more important activities at the site rather than initial stage reduction and preform manufacture.
A high number and diversity of chert material types were recorded. Numerous chert material
types and parent materials were present, including a variety of fine-grained grays, tans, and
browns, some banded, and a few coarse-grained gray and tan material types, as well as
cryptocrystalline materials, possibly quartzite. This variation reflects a number of different
sources for siliceous materials and may represent use of the site by a number of different groups
over a longer period of time (AUs 6 through 8). The in-situ context of the cultural deposits,
especially in the Late Archaic was excellent, based on concentration of specific observed chert
material types at different, specific hearth feature locations. Clusters of the same material were
consistently found together at feature locations, implying removal from the same core (at a
specific location).
One potentially important lithic feature was recorded in AU 7 (Feature 29). Feature 29 was a
cache of more than 50 large primary flakes in a dense cluster. A photo is presented in Chapter 7.
The flakes were tightly clustered together, all large flakes, and many exhibited cortex indicating

initial stage reduction off of a larger core. This is a unique find at the site in comparison to the
remainder of the lithic collection. Unfortunately, no further information is available on the cache,
in terms of feature forms, mapping, sampling, or collection (see Chapter 7).
The collection represents significant data primarily in AUs 6 through 8 representing a Late
Archaic long-lived, relatively stable surface for approximately 600 years (2700 to 2100 yr Cal
BP). Although there are many identifiable differences between AUs 6 through 8, there are more
similarities, especially when compared with the other periods at the site. The tools and debitage
from AUs 6 through 8 indicate a fair degree of initial stage tool manufacture and reduction, and
to a larger degree, predominantly the later and final stages of formal tool manufacture, with
considerable evidence of used or expended tool resharpening or rejuvenation, prior to discard
(see Chapter 9). The lithic assemblage was limited in variability and contains only a few stone
tool forms and types. Present are a limited variety of small, expedient knives, cutting and slicing
tools, hide scrapers, immediate-use tools, and hunting implements in the form of projectile
points. Overall, the site appears to have been an open, seasonally occupied campsite where a
limited set of tool production activities occurred, at least in the Late Archaic interval. Yet
occurring within the context of broad-spectrum resources exploitation of the local environment
in terms of faunal and riverine resources, from very small mammals to bison sized prey,
including an impressive array of resources available in the West Fork of the Trinity River.
From the lithic assemblage, the Late Archaic occupation of the site was a seasonally occupied,
temporary hunting camp where dart points were manufactured, used and resharpened, along with
the use of a few supportive tools. This is consistent with the faunal data from AUs 6 through 8,
which contains extensive evidence of the hunting and processing of bison- and deer-size
mammals as well a variety of smaller mammals. Deer and bison were hunted off site and
transportable portions brought back to the camp for processing. There is also evidence of the
processing of whole specimens of deer and bison on site (see Chapter 8) during the Late Archaic
Interval.
From additional lines of archeological evidence in the form of mussels, hearth feature
morphology, and associated artifact content, the Late/Transitional Archaic occupations (AUs 4
Mercado Site (41TR203)

and 5) were temporary camps oriented around mollusk collection and consumption, along with
variable and broad-spectrum hunting and collection activities. Plant food processing probably in
earth-type ovens is indicated within this Late/Transitional Archaic set of occupations on the
West Fork terrace. In the later history of the site, during the Late Prehistoric, site 41TR203 was a
hunting encampment focused on deer and broad-spectrum small mammal, amphibian, and
reptilian exploitation and a riverine focus, with small hearth features and significant evidence of
plant food processing in earth type oven.
13.18 Burned Earth Synthesis
The analysis of the artifact assemblage of the materials recovered by the excavation of
site 41TR203 identified two morphological variants of burned clay in the artifact assemblage:
1) platy fiber impressed fragments; and 2) irregular rounded objects. The geoarchaeological
study (see Chapter 6) documented three forms of burned earth: 1) in-situ thermal rubified rims
associated with thermal features; 2) small fragments of burned earth presumed to have been
detached from the baked earth of thermal features (presumably scatted by cleaning out hearths
and other features); and 3) platy, apparently sand-tempered objects. The first two categories are
thought to be related and were noted in the soil micromorphological analysis (see Chapter 6,
Figures 6.26 and 6.22) as well as in the microartifact study. The last category, platy burned
objects, was incidentally sampled by a micromorphological sample from Feature 20, Unit 28.
Although it was not apparent that the latter was a fiber-impressed burned object, the appearance
of this material in thin section indicated that it was not incidentally fired site matrix material, but
rather contained considerably more sand, and was most likely a sand-tempered earthen object of
some form.
Research topics included: 1) background research; 2) documentation of the burned earth
assemblage in basic terms; 3) characterize the materials using various analytical methods,
specifically using thin section petrography and computer tomography; and 4) experimental
replication and subsequent analysis of resulting objects in a manner similar to that used to
characterize the burned earth artifacts.

Mercado Site (41TR203)

510

July 2019

The burned earth assemblage was comprised of approximately 3,300 specimens and was
examined by Dr. Charles Frederick (see Appendix D). The specimens were collected from the
features found within the excavation blocks and the geoarcheology trench. The frequent
observation made from the analysis was the specimens were reddened (rubefaction), expressed
by a 7.5 YR Munsell hue and hardened (sintered). An alternative observation made of the burned
earth specimens was that some of the specimens exhibited a carbon core that would have been
developed by the material being thermally altered and the oxidation of the organic material not
being burned completely.
Burned earth has been linked in the archeological record to representing an applied mud plaster
that would have been spread over thatched roofing as a means of fire and leak proofing. When
the mud plaster is applied the imprint of the thatch grass roof would be imprinted onto the mud
plaster and then when thermally altered it would keep the impression. Site 41TR203 showed no
significant evidence to support that the burned earth was from a mud plaster for a prehistoric
structure. Another rarity in the archeological record is âbaked clay ballsâ that were used
expediently for hot rock cooking when rocks were not locally available. Even though sources site
the north- central Texas being one of the geographic areas where the baked clay balls were used,
site 41TR203 showed no evidence of this activity within the assemblage. The conclusion was the
burned earth specimens excavated at site 41TR203 were accidental byproducts of human
occupation and their activities on the landscape (see Appendix D).
13.18.1 Comparative Settlement Patterns Summary
Using four area sites with similar chronographic spans, the settlement pattern at site 41TR203 is
compared and contrasted in the following section using stratigraphy, sedimentation rate, features,
and assemblages.
13.19 Site 41CO150
13.19.1 Stratigraphy and Sedimentation Rate
Site 41CO150 (Gemma site) is in the floodplain of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River about
50 miles north-northeast of site 41TR203. Within its complicated stratigraphy, hearths with
Mercado Site (41TR203)

511

July 2019

faunal remains and artifacts were recorded in the fill of two separate, old river channels. The
assemblage dates to ~2900 to 1700 yr Cal BP during the Late Archaic, which makes it a good
candidate for comparison with the slightly younger assemblage from site 41TR203 that dates to
~2600 to 500 yr Cal BP. The Gemma site is considered one of the best series of stratified Late
Archaic occupations in the region because it revealed features and charcoal in discrete
occupation surfaces, most of which were separated by sterile alluvium within a chute cut-off
channel (Ferring and Yates 1997:61). However, one should note that only approximately six
radiocarbon dates were obtained for site 41CO150.
The Late Prehistoric deposits at site 41CO150 were within a neck cut-off channel associated with
an oxbow lake, and similarly well-stratified, consisting of finely laminated silts in couplets of
courser flood-stage silt overlaid by post-flood clay suspension (Ferring and Yates 1997:58). The
Late Prehistoric assemblage consisted of hearths and shell-tempered ceramic sherds and
demonstrated the continued use of abandoned river channels for occupation as the Late Archaic
groups had done. These deposits indicate slow floodplain aggradation after ~1700 yr Cal BP
with little change since; whereas, several meters of late Holocene floodplain accretion are
documented at the Aubrey site (41DN479) about 10 miles south-southeast of site 41CO150 and
also along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Thus, highly variable sedimentation rates are
indicated in various parts of the Upper Trinity River Valley during the same periods in
prehistory. Variation in sedimentation rates is also evident at the Mercado site at ~1700 yr Cal
BP, which falls within a period of slower sedimentation (~1880 to 1450 yr Cal BP), but another
interval of more rapid sedimentation follows at ~1450 to 1200 yr Cal BP.
13.19.2 Features and Assemblages
Late Archaic occupation at 41CO150 was evidenced by 44 features, most of which were unlined
or clay-lined hearths with ash, indicating complete fuel burning in shallow pits with good air
circulation. The highest densities of mussel shell were associated with unlined hearths in Stratum
B2 at the site. The rock-lined hearths tended to have more charcoal. Hearths in Stratum B2
contained a considerable range of small mammals, fish, turtle, birds, and deer remains, indicative
of grassland, aquatic, and woodland environments. Of the 23 typed projectile points from
Mercado Site (41TR203)

512

July 2019

site 41CO150, 7 are Gary points (contrary to Prikyrl [1990]), with the remainder including Darl,
Marcos, Ellis-Ensor, Godley, Yarborough, and Trinity (Ferring and Yates 1997:67-72). Overall,
the lithic assemblage suggested an intensive occupation with 14 bifacial tools exhibiting frequent
resharpening.
The occupation in Stratum A3 at site 41CO150 overlays Stratum B2 and is about 500 to 600
years younger. While A3 had a high density of artifacts, bone, and mussel shell, there were only
a few small hearth features. The untyped projectile points were corner-notched to short-stemmed
shapes and stylistically distinct from those in Strata B2 or A2 (above A3). Interestingly, Gary
points were within B2, absent from A3, and appeared again in A2 (Ferring and Yates 1997:75).
Site 41CO150 was interpreted as a record of repeated occupations by apparently mobile groups
who exploited local resources from habitats surrounding the site (Ferring and Yates 1997:99).
13.20 Site 41CO144
13.20.1 Stratigraphy and Sedimentation Rate
Site 41CO144 is about 4 miles south of 41CO150 and was recorded along the Elm Fork of the
Trinity River within the fill of cut-off channels, in contexts similar to site 41CO150. Two
radiocarbon assays from 2 m below the surface date that portion of the site to ~2300 yr Cal BP.
Unlike site 41CO150, sediment accrued at site 41CO144 at a moderate rate until ~800 to 750 yr
Cal BP when slower deposition began (Ferring and Yates 1997:103). Similar sedimentation rates
are also evident at the Mercado site at ~800 to 750 yr Cal BP, which falls within a period of
slower sedimentation (~1200 to 620 yr Cal BP) corresponding to AUs 1 and 3, after which no
subsequent interval of more rapid sedimentation was recorded at the Mercado site.
13.20.2 Features and Assemblages
Seven features consisting of rock-lined and unlined hearths were encountered along with an
assemblage of burned rock, burned bone, burned clay, charcoal, mussel shell, debitage, and bison
remains. Besides Feature 5, which was intrusive and dated to ~500 yr Cal BP, there was no other
evidence of a Late Prehistoric occupation at site 41CO144. Features 1, 2, and 3 were in the same
stratigraphic context that was radiocarbon dated to ~2300 yr Cal BP. Overall, 13 projectile points
Mercado Site (41TR203)

513

July 2019

were recorded in Late Archaic context, including Dallas, Gary, Godley, and Ellis types. The
Mercado projectile points included 5 Gary points (in AUs 6-8 dated to ~2700 to 2100 yr Cal BP)
and an Ellis-Ensor point (in AU 4 dated to ~2200 to 1400 yr Cal BP), all in Late Archaic
contexts. Evidence of whole deer carcasses being processed at the site was encountered along
with indications of the exploitation of multiple habitats typical of bottomland environments, such
as grassland, woodland edge, and riparian (Ferring and Yates 1997). Less burned rock and
mussel shell than at site 41CO150 was noted, but the two sites shared a Late Archaic record
indicative of repeated occupations, stratified artifact assemblages and features, and the foraging
of local food resources (Ferring and Yates 1997:127).
13.21 Site 41CO141
13.21.1 Stratigraphy and Sedimentation Rate
Site 41CO141 is about 0.62 mi south of site 41CO144 and along the Elm Fork of the Trinity
River at its confluence with Spring Creek. Early excavations revealed a Late Archaic human
burial along with three hearth features and a knapping event ranging in time from ~1750 to 965
yr Cal BP (Yates and Ferring 1997:129-131). Later excavations produced more radiocarbon
assays, and overall at site 41CO141 the assemblage ranges from Late Archaic (~1750 yr Cal BP)
to Late Prehistoric (~1300 to 760 yr Cal BP). As at sites 41CO144 and 41CO150, there was good
geomorphic evidence of channel shifts in the vicinity of 41CO141 during ~3000 to 2000 yr Cal
BP. Otherwise, detailed information about sedimentation rates was not provided in the report,
perhaps, because site 41CO141 lacked detailed stratigraphic resolution. The later, more extensive
excavations at site 41CO141 suffered from widespread surface disturbances that were a
consequence of the site being encountered during construction of an adjacent bridge. Disturbed
soils were removed prior to controlled excavations, resulting in some degree of truncation.
13.21.2 Features and Assemblages
Besides the human burial, Late Archaic occupations are poorly represented at site 41CO141, but
evidence is present in the deepest level excavated (Gary and Ellis projectile points). Likewise,
the Mercado projectile points included multiple Gary points and an Ellis-Ensor point during the
Mercado Site (41TR203)

514

July 2019

Late Archaic. Late Prehistoric assemblages at site 41CO141 immediately overlay the Late
Archaic component, and are considered important evidence of the age and character of the
transition from the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods (Yates and Ferring 1997:135).
Similarly, AUs 4 and 5 at the Mercado site are dated to ~1815 to 1415 yr Cal BP during a
proposed Late/Transitional Archaic Period for the West Fork of the Trinity River.
The Late Prehistoric assemblage was comprised of relatively few lithic artifacts, but included
projectile points typed as Gary, Fresno, Scallorn, Alba-Catahoula, and Washita. One of the
Washita points was crafted from Edwards chert, while all other lithic artifacts were made of
quartzite or local chert. Intense cultural activity is indicated at the site, but lithic reduction was
not represented, and no ceramic artifacts were encountered. Site 41CO141 is interpreted as a
hunting and collecting station that was repeatedly occupied by mobile groups (Yates and Ferring
1997:154). Food was prepared and consumed at his location, although seasonally or periodically,
and the site may be associated with more permanent settlements nearby.
Seven features were defined, yielding abundant burned rock and substantial samples of bone and
mussel shell. Rock-lined hearths were common and associated with the mussel shell. The
cultural deposits resembled a midden. While turtle remains were the most numerous, deer
contributed the major meat component to the diet of residents at site 41CO141, and whole
carcasses were apparently processed at the site (Yates and Ferring 1997:148). Twelve deer
metapodials were used as tools (grinders), and other deer bones exhibit cut marks and spiral
fractures indicative of butchery and marrow extraction. Other animals such as rabbits, rodents,
turkey, quail, raccoon, and beaver were hunted along with a variety of fish and aquatic turtles.
Thus, the Late Prehistoric subsistence pattern at site 41CO141 was comparable to other Late
Archaic sites in the Upper Trinity River Valley, with the exploitation of riparian, woodland, and
grassland habitats and with small game and aquatic resources complimenting deer in the
assemblage (Yates and Ferring 1997:154).

Mercado Site (41TR203)

515

July 2019

13.22 Site 41TR198
13.22.1 Stratigraphy and Sedimentation Rate
Like the Mercado site, discrete occupational components with datable material were encountered
at site 41TR198, which is about 3.4 km (2.1 mi) southeast along the West Fork of the Trinity
River. Its components range from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric periods (Peter and
Harrison 2011). The sedimentation rates calculated for site 41TR198 do not comport with those
from the Mercado site. In fact, some of the fastest rates (35 cm/year at 1700 yr Cal BP and
22.3 cm/year at 1750 yr Cal BP) coincide with a much slower sedimentation rate of 3.24 cm/year
during ~1880 to 1450 yr Cal BP at site 41TR203. Likewise, the slowest sedimentation rate at
site 41TR198 (5.14 cm/year at 1360 yr Cal BP) occurs when sedimentation at site 41TR203 is
proceeding nearly twice as fast (9.87 cm/year during ~1450 to 1200 yr Cal BP).
13.22.2 Features and Assemblages
The components at site 41TR198 contained a significant amount of well-preserved faunal
remains, burned rock features, and bone and shell lenses. Late Archaic Feature 25 contained
onion or camas bulbs (AD 140 to 340) along with deer, turtle, and bird remains. Another bulb
from a non-feature context was dated to AD 300â350. Feature 10 in AU 1 dates to ~1280 to 970
yr Cal BP, while Feature 26 in AU 4 dates to ~1710 to 1415 yr Cal BP. Notably, no bison
remains were identified within the Late Archaic assemblage at site 41TR198. Likewise, bison
remains are not found in any AUs that are radiocarbon dated to after 2000 yr Cal BP at the
Mercado site. The most intensive occupation at site 41TR198 was at the end of the Late Archaic
(AD 140 to 350) and contained Yarborough, Trinity, and Axtell projectile points. The occupation
continued into the Late Prehistoric (AD 700 to 1040) with four grit-tempered ceramic sherds, but
the component lacked arrow points.
The hearth features at site 41TR198 were similar to those at the Mercado site and sites 41CO144
and 41CO150 along the Upper Trinity River Valley. Except while Ogalla chert dominates the
assemblage at sites 41CO144 and 41CO150, local Uvalde gravel and central Texas chert are
common at sites 41TR198 and 41TR170. At other nearby sites (41COL172 and 41DL203),
Mercado Site (41TR203)

quartzite is the material of choice along with some central Texas chert. A small cache of central
Texas Edwards chert primary flakes (Feature 29) was documented at the Mercado site, but most
of the lithic material appears to be locally sourced chert, with some quartzite present.
The variety of molluscs at the site indicates a medium-sized river with slow-moving waters to a
depth of 0.9 m and primarily mud with some sand as substratum. Before AD 900, the site
contains rock features and ground stone artifacts, but after that point rock features are not wellrepresented and ground stone is non-existent. This is interpreted as an emphasis on plant
resources in the Late Archaic (though deer were hunted) and a preference for smaller game
during the Late Prehistoric.
13.23 Site 41TR203
The Late Archaic component at Mercado site (principally AUs 6 through 8) formed on a
relatively stable surface during about 600 years (~2700 to 2100 yr Cal BP). The lithic
assemblage was limited in variability, containing only a few stone tool forms and types, but the
tools and debitage indicate a fair degree of initial-stage tool manufacture and reduction, and
more commonly the later and final stages of formal tool manufacturing. There was also
considerable resharpening or rejuvenation of tools before they were discarded. The site is
interpreted as an open, seasonally occupied (spring to fall) campsite in the context of a local
environment with a broad spectrum of resources, including riverine, woodland, and grassland
habitats. Their prey ranged from small mammals and aquatic life to deer and bison. The larger
prey were commonly killed and processed off-site, but there were some examples of whole
specimens of both deer and bison being processed at the camp.
During the Late/Transitional Archaic at the Mercado site, mussels become a more prominent
food source, but the subsistence strategy continued to include variable and broad-spectrum
hunting and collection activities. Plant processing within earth ovens is evident during this
transitional period. The Late Prehistoric component at the site is indicative of a hunting
encampment focused on deer, broad-spectrum small mammals, amphibians, and reptiles. Small
hearth/earth oven features also preserved significant evidence of plant food processing.

There are discernible trends in the subsistence data that indicate changes in occupational
intensity, subsistence, and inferentially group size. At the same time, the technological
consistency of burned rock features suggests a long-lived subsistence pattern, stretching from the
Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric, and perhaps made possible because site 41TR203 is situated
on a relatively stable surface at the convergence of riverine, woodland, and grassland habitats.
