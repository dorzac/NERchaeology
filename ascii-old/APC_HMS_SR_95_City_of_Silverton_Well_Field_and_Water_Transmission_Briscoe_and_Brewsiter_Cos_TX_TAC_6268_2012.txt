City of Silverton Well Field and Water Transmission Line Project

Abstract
The City of Silverton (City) plans to develop a water well field and to construct a new water
transmission line that will connect with an existing municipal water line west of the City in Briscoe and
Swisher Counties. The well field is currently privately owned and if deemed acceptable for the
development, the property may be purchased by the City. Funding for the project will be through the
Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) Economically Depressed Areas Program. The water
transmission line route will be installed in an easement owned by the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT). The part of the project located in the TxDOT easement is subject to the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT) which requires the consideration of any potential effects on cultural resources before new
construction projects begin.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) where new construction will take place for the well field is
not yet known, but could affect about 47.9 acres. The actual route of the water line has not been
determined. The estimated APE for the water line will be about 11 miles long by 15 feet wide or about
39.6 acres in area. The total area that could be affected by the project is about 78.4 acres. Antiquities
Planning & Consulting (APC) performed a cultural resources survey of corridors inside the well field of
about 103 acres and 28.8 acres inside RR2301 and SH86 rights-of-way, for total coverage of about 131.8
acres.
One historic house was found inside the well field tract. It is a 1950s dwelling with a metal
outbuilding. The house is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or
as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) based on lack of architectural style. During the survey, no
diagnostic artifacts were seen and no artifacts were collected for analysis or curation. Lastly, the property
has been farmed by one individual for 51 years and he has not found any cultural material in the fields.
For these reasons, APC concludes that no significant cultural resources eligible for listing in the
NRHP and/or as SALs will be affected by the proposed activity. APC, therefore, recommends that
development of the City of Silverton Well Field and Water Transmission Line project proceed with one
routine construction condition. APC recommends that if unexpected archeological deposits are exposed
during construction, digging should stop at the discovery location and APC should be notified, by
telephone at (512) 398-2946. The find should be evaluated by APC archeologists in consultation with the
Texas Historical Commission before digging resumes at the location.

City of Silverton Well Field and Water Transmission Line Project

1.0 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The City of Silverton (City) has plans to develop a water well field and to construct a
water transmission line to augment the municipal water supply (Figure 1). The project will be
funded with monies from the Economically Depressed Areas Program administered by Texas
Water Development Board (TWDB). The well field development will be reviewed and approved
by the Texas Commission of Environmental Quality (TCEQ) prior to construction.
The actual location of the water transmission line has not been determined. The water line
right-of way will be about 11 miles long by 15 feet wide and will be placed in the edge of
existing Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) easements. The well field is currently
privately owned and is a slightly less than one mile square section or about 607 acres in area. If
deemed acceptable for well field development, the City may purchase the property.
The part of the project that will be located on public land is subject to requirements under
the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) and review by the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
Brandt Engineers (Brandt), Amarillo, Texas, on behalf of the City, contracted with Antiquities
Planning & Consulting (APC) Kyle, Texas, to comply with the ACT and to conduct an intensive
cultural resources survey for the project. The survey was performed under Antiquities Permit
Number 6268.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) where new construction will take place is
approximately 47.9 acres in area. Eleven locations inside the well field may be affected in the
future and will cover areas 110 by 110 feet (0.28 acres each) for a total affected area of 3.06
acres. In addition, a ground storage tank and a pump station will be built in the tract covering 300
by 300 feet and will affect about 2.1 acres. The estimated collection line length inside the well
field is 9230 feet by 15 feet wide for a total of 8.34 acres. In sum, the affected area in the well
field may be 8.34 acres. Outside the well field, the proposed water line will affect about 39.56
acres. The total area inspected by APC was about 131.8 acres.
APC performed a survey of about 103.8 acres inside the well field. Inside existing
roadway easements and plowed fields adjacent to right-of-ways, 4 miles long by 15 feet wide or
28.8 acres, were examined, on both sides of the highway easements. The results showed that
although one historic building is present inside the well field locale, and it is not a significant.
Therefore, no properties potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic places
(NRHP) and/or as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) will be affected by the construction
and no further cultural resources work or consultation is needed.
APC recommends that the development of the water well field proceed anywhere inside
Section 99, Block B-2, Abstract 108, Swisher County. In addition, the installation of the water
transmission line along SH86 and RR2301 easements can proceed with one routine construction
condition. If unexpected archeological deposits are exposed during excavation, digging should
stop at the discovery location and APC should be notified, by telephone at (512) 398-2946. The
find should be evaluated by APC archeologists, in consultation with the THC, before digging
resumes at the location.

2.0 CITY OF SILVERTON WELL FIELD AND WATER TRANSMISSION LINE
PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
This report summarizes the findings of the 2012 cultural resources survey of the
proposed City of Silverton Well Field and Water Transmission Line Project area. The previous
report section begins the report with a Management Summary. The second section discusses the
project area, construction plans, environmental setting, cultural history, and previous cultural
resources investigations. The third section presents methodology and the fourth section reports
and discusses results. The fifth and final section presents conclusions and recommendations.
References and Appendices with maps close the report.
PROJECT AREA
The project area is located in a rural farm setting west of Silverton, Texas and East of
Tulia, Texas, about 48 miles south of Amarillo, in western central Swisher County and eastern
central Briscoe County (Figure 1). The water transmission line route will begin at an existing
City water line seven miles west of Silverton. The actual placement of the pipe is not yet known,
but will be inside the right of way of State Highway (SH) 86. It will extend west eight miles to
Ranch Road (RR) 2301, where it turns south. The route will run for four miles along one of the
easements of RR2301 to the well field (Figure 2).
The well field is located in Section 99, Block B-2, Abstract 108, Swisher County, three
miles south of the intersection of SH86 and RR 2301. It is currently used for cultivation and is set
up as a center point irrigation field divided into quarters (Figure 3). No archeological sites or
historic properties listed in the NRHP and/or designated as SALS are present inside, adjacent to,
or in the vicinity of the project area.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The water transmission line will be constructed inside the existing right-of-way of SH86 and
RR2301 and will connect the well field to an existing water line (Figure 4). It will be placed in the edge of
highway easements, pending the location of previously installed buried utilities. The side of the right-ofway where the water transmission line will be placed is not yet known and could be placed on either side
of SH86 and RR2301. At the time of writing, the planned pipe size is 12 inches, but is subject to change.
The length of the water line is 11 miles and the width of the easement that may be affected during
construction may be up to 15 feet.

City of Silverton Well Field and Water Transmission Line Project

The Area of Potential Effect (APE) where new construction of the water line will take place is
estimated to be about 47.9, including 8.34 acres for the well field and 39.56 acres for the water
transmission line. The depth of impact will be between 4-5 feet with a 36 to 42-inch minimum cover and
may be subject to change if the pipe size should change. The playa lake will be avoided and will not be a
part of the well field development. The two acres in the north east corner of the well field are owned by a
third party and will not be included in the development.
The well field will be developed inside Section 99, Block B-2, Abstract No.108, Swisher County,
in an area bout 607 acres in size. The well field contains eleven existing water wells ranging in depth from
200-760 feet and is currently in use as a center point irrigation field. Excluded from the project area are
the two acres at the northeast corner of the section and about twenty-three acres in the southwestern part
of the section where the playa lake is located. At this time, there are no plans to drill new wells. If wells
are drilled in the future, they will be 30 feet from existing wells. Current plans call for installing new
casings at selected existing wells (Figure 4). Each well that will be completed will have a concrete sealing
pad and piping installed in areas approximately 20 feet square around the well. Areas around the existing
wells measuring 110 feet by 110 feet will be fenced.
Collection lines will be constructed along with a ground storage tank and a booster pump station.
At this time, it is anticipated that the wells that are needed to meet the supply are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 11.
Plans call for a water transmission line to run between these wells and the pump station location that will
be located at the historic twentieth century building locale situated east of well number 5. Plans call for
the pump station and tank to be constructed in the vicinity of the existing building and should occupy an
area less than 300 feet by 300 feet. The layout designs for the collections lines and the pump station have
not yet been finalized.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The proposed project is located on top of the Llano Estacado in the northwestern Panhandle of
Texas in the High Plains physiographic region (Raiz 1957). It can be characterized as level farm land with
many playa lakes and is part of a massive mesa located near the eastern edge of the Caprock Escarpment.
In terms of structural geology, the region falls in the Amarillo Uplift, an area of moderate uplift (Oetking
et al 1959). The surface geology is made up of Pliocene, Miocene, and Oligicene-aged strata (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1979). Relief varies slightly from 3350 to 2265 feet above mean sea level (ft amsl).
The region is underlain by the Ogallala Fresh water aquifer and lies inside the Red River Basin.
The Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River is located about 10 miles northeast of the eastern part of the
line. The upper reaches of Tule Creek crosses SH86, near the easternmost part of the water line. The
western part of the project area is in the Plains Grassland region and the eastern part is in the Mesquite
Savanna vegetation region (Arbingast et al. 1975). Blair (1950) places the region in the Kansan biotic
province made up of short-grass plains.
Soils on top of the Llano Estacado are predominately Pullman Association deep, nearly level to
gently sloping clay loams on smooth uplands (Geiger and Mitchell 1973). Pullman Clay loam, 1 to 3 per
cent slope with a typical profile of 0 to 6 inches of clay loam over 45 inches of clay on top of about 60
inches of calcareous silty clay (Geiger and Mitchell 1973:20). Playas are surrounded by Estacado series
deep calcareous loamy soils 80 inches deep.

CULTURAL HISTORY OVERVIEW
In terms of cultural resources, the Llano Estacado is part of the Southern High Plains
archeological region of Northern Texas. It is a region with a rich and diverse cultural history known to
contain many canyons, streams and playa lakes often selected by prehistoric and historic groups for
occupation. Outcrops of flint gravels used for stone tool making are common. Protected, wooded, and
watered locations with varied plant and animal colonies including canyons, stream valleys, rock shelters,
playa lakes, and springs are present. Geographic placement between the High Plains, the Caprock
Escarpment, the Southwestern Desert, and the Pecos River made the Llano Estacado literally a center of
cultural mix and exchange and influence.
The Lake Theo archeological site in Caprock Canyon State Park about 25 miles east of the project
area is indicative of the length of human occupation in the region. It contained strata from the PaleoIndian
period (11,500 to 8000 BP), Archaic period (8000 to 2500 BP), Ceramic period (2000 to 500 BP), Late
Prehistoric (2500 Bp to 200BP) or Protohistoric period (200 BP to AD 1450), and into the Historic period
(A.D. 1540-1870) (Harrison and Killen 1978; Johnson and Holliday 1997). The reader is directed to
Johnson and Holliday (1997) and Boyd et al. (1997 and 1989) for thorough discussions of time periods
and regional archeological investigations. Brief overviews are presented here.
Prehistory
Prior to 11,500 years BP, Pre-Clovis cultures were probably present in the region. As early as
11,500 years BP, nomadic PaleoIndian groups were in the region and occupied caves, rock shelters,
springs, and bluff lines (Holliday 1997). These groups hunted mega fauna. Distinct flint knapping
technology existed during the Early PaleoIndian period and is characterized by fluted style projectile
points, such as Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview; with Firstview, Hell Gap, Midland, Milnesand, Sandia,
and Scotsbluff types. Archeological sites in the region from this period are Plainview, Rex Rogers,
Lubbock Lake, Midland, Lake Theo, and Ryan’s Site.
From 8000 to 2500 BP, Archaic peoples occupied camps in all environmental settings and camps
are found in larger numbers. Bison hunting and bison kill sites, prehistoric well excavation and use; food
processing features developed. Side and corner notched points are common in the Archaic. An example of
Early Archaic projectile point types in the region is Angostura. Archeological sites in the region from the
Archaic period are Lubbock Lake, Marks Beach, Lake Theo, Floydada Country Club, and Tule Canyon.
Technological and material culture changes mark the beginning of the Late Prehistoric period in
all regions. The bow and arrow are introduced and projectile point styles decrease in size. Limited
manufacture and ceramic use was in practice. Appearance of petroglyphs and pictographs occurs. Bison
kills occurred in large numbers in the region. The type of pottery most often found in Late Prehistoric
period sites is Mogollon brownware. Deadman’s, Garza, Harrell, Lott, Edwards, Scallorn, Perdiz, and
Washita style projectile points were in use. Evidence of travel, trade, and regional interaction is present in
the archeological record of this period.
During the Late Prehistoric period of A.D. 500 to A.D. 1100 to 1200, the Palo Duro complex of
semi-sedentary peoples was living on the Caprock east of the study area. As redefined by Boyd (1995),
this complex is represented in the archeological record by established residential bases with pit houses,
rock shelters, and open camps. Occupations were seasonal and with a focus on food gathering and
processing, and possibly horticulture. Burial data collected to date indicates the Palo Duro peoples
engaged in warfare during this time.
The Ceramic period (2000-500BP) is a time of transition and cultural infusion (Johnson and
Holliday 1995:528). During the Early Ceramic time period (2000-1000 BP), Archaic style dart points,

City of Silverton Well Field and Water Transmission Line Project

Late Prehistoric type arrow points, and Protohistoric period pottery are found in the archeological record
mixed together. In the Late Ceramic period (1000-500 BP), Puebloan trade pottery from the Southwest is
mixed Plains styled stone tools and projectile points.
The Protohistoric period (200 BP to AD 1450) is represented by numerous sites with living
surfaces, large game animal processing stations, and Garza points. Native American Jumano groups with
semi-sedentary and semi-nomadic Southwestern cultural traditions arrived in the area. Between AD 14001600 a series of discrete cultural assemblages developed in the Llano Estacado, including Palo Duro,
Garza. Tierra Blanca, Wheeler, Edwards, and Antelope Creek.
History
The first European explorers in the region arrived in the mid-sixteenth century and included
Francisco Vazquez De Coronado. Some scholars believe the expedition passed through Tule Canyon and
Palo Duro Canyon (Morris 1997; Stephens and Holmes 1989). Spanish missionaries allied with and
attempted religious conversion of Native American groups. Explorers Corporal Jose Mares in 1788; Don
Pedro Vial in 1787, 1788, and 1792; and Amangual, in 1801, discovered three routes across the Llano
Escatado (Morris1997:p182). The routes of Mares and Francisco Amangual passed south of Tule Canyon
in the vicinity of the project area. Spanish and French governments claimed control of the region until the
eighteenth century (Morris 1997:330).
Native American groups who occupied the area into Historic times were Lipan Apaches and
Comanches. In 1840, the Texas Santa Fe Expedition passed near Quitaque northeast of the project area. In
1852, Captain Randolph Marcy followed the Priarie Dog Town Fork into the region. Buffalo hunters
came in the mid-nineteenth century, along with military expeditions. Battles with the Indians were fought
in the region until the 1870s. Colonel Randald S. McKenzie entered the region in 1872 and battled
Indians at Tule Creek. The locale of the infamous 1874 McKenzie Horse Killing Site (archeological site
41SW30) at Tule Canyon is located in the vicinity of the project area (Speer 1970). Other notable historic
events in the region were the Red River War of 1874 and the battle of Palo Duro Canyon in 1874.
Briscoe County was separated from the Bexar District in 1876 and formally organized in 1892
(Abbe and Anderson 1996). Ranches and towns were established in the 1880s. The settlement of the City
of Silverton began in 1890. From 1900 to 1930, the economy shifted from ranching to farming and the
population of the county doubled. The rail road arrived in 1928. An economic decline followed from 1929
to 1950 and again from 1970 to 2000 when the county population was1790, with 771 in Silverton and 400
in Quitaque.
Abbe and Leffler (1996) provide a history of Swisher County and is the source of the facts
presented here. Swisher County remained unsettled until the 1800s, when the JA Ranch of Charle
Goodnight expanded into the area. The county was organized in 1890 and Tulia was made the seat of
government. From 1900 to 1920 the number of farms and ranches in the county steadily increased. The
rail road reached Plainview in 1906. Population declined in the 1930s until large scale irrigation and use
of underground water from the Ogallala formation became available in 1936. From the 1940 to 1950s the
county experienced some economic diversification, including feedlot operations, and the population
increased again and by 2000 it was 8378. Claytonville was established in 1954 around a gin, grocery, and
café (Anderson 1996b).
Previous Survey Investigations
South Tule Draw, 2 to 5 miles north of the project area, contains many prehistoric campsites,
lithic scatters, and hearths (Katz and Katz 1976) and also human burial sites (Taylor and Osburn (2010).
Lake MacKenzie, ca. 6 miles north of the project area, contains prehistoric campsites and lithic scatters
(Katz 1998). Three known archeological sites fall in the vicinity of the project and are 41BI545,

City of Silverton Well Field and Water Transmission Line Project

41SW30, and 41SW39. Site 41SW30 is the historic 1874 Mackenzie Horse Kill Site associated with the
Battle of Palo Duro Canyon. Site 41SW 39 is the Herring Ranch Burial. Site 41BI545 is the Quinn
Montaque Site, a multiple component Archaic and Late Prehistoric/Early Historic period open campsite.
Segments of the water transmission line route have been previously inspected for cultural
resources. A five-mile long portion of the line located in the SH86 highway right-of-way was surveyed
prior to the installation of the Mid-Plains Rural Telephone Cooperative buried fiber optic line (Briscoe
2008). No cultural resources were found west of Silverton along this portion SH86. The SH86 right-ofway from Intersection of US87 in Tulia to Intersection of SH207 in Silverton was inspected by
archeologists and no cultural resources were found (State Department of Highways and Public
Transportation 1975).
SUMMARY
No known archeological sites and/or historic properties listed on the NRHP and/or as SALS are
present inside, adjacent to, and/or in the vicinity of the project area. Part of the water transmission line
ROW along SH86 has already been examined for cultural resources by archeologists with negative
results. The well field locale has not been examined for cultural resources and contains High Probability
Areas (HPAs) for the presence for cultural resources, including a playa lake and potential historic house
sites.
It is anticipated that historic house sites may be present adjacent to roads laid out before the
1960s. Some house sites may be late nineteenth century in age and contain subterranean features such as a
cistern or well. Cisterns and/or wells can possess high research value, if intact, and should be avoided.
For these reasons and to comply with the ACT, performance of an intensive pedestrian survey was
recommended for the well field and parts of the water line that have not yet been inspect and it was
performed by APC in June 2012. Discussions of the survey research direction, methods, and results
follow in the next report sections.

3.0 CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
RESEARCH DIRECTION
The research purpose of the cultural resources survey is to collect new data about cultural history
and prehistory of the Llano Estacado. The regulatory objectives of the cultural resources survey are (1) to
locate any cultural resources present in the area proposed for new construction and (2) to identify any
significant historic properties present that could be affected by the proposed activity. These include, but
are not restricted to, buildings built before 1967, historic cemeteries (pre-1952), and archeological sites
(pre-1912).
METHODS
The survey tasks and methodology will be performed in accordance with, and at the rates
specified in, the Texas Archeology Survey Standards with modifications related to subsurface survey and
coverage. Before the survey, APC performed background research and developed the research direction
discussed here. Pertinent literature, site data, maps, and files related to known sites were reviewed using
the Texas Archeological and Historical Atlas, the Texas State Library, and the APC library sources.
Preliminary maps and indices were checked to determine if historic properties listed on the NRHP and/or
as a SAL fall inside or adjacent to the project area.
For management purposes, the survey area was divided into HPAs and Low Probability Areas
(LPAs) for the presence of cultural resources. HPAs for prehistoric sites were judged to be playa lakes.
HPAs for historic sites were judged to be house site locales depicted on maps and aerial photographs
dated 1967 and earlier. Plowed fields were judged to be LPAs.
Water Transmission Line
Parallel transects were walked at 5 meter intervals apart covering the potential 30-foot wide
highways easements where new construction may take place inside either side of the roadway easements.
The ground surface was visible along SH86 the south side of SH86 where trenching has recently been
performed. The ROWs of RR2301 on both sides were covered in dense grass and the survey corridor was
shifted to the adjacent plowed fields where visibility was 100 percent. Both sides of the road were
examined to allow for project design flexibility.
Of the 11 mile water line, a 6 mile segment along the south side of SH86 has been previously
inspected by archeologists. No archeological sites were found in the sections where the water transmission
line will be placed (Briscoe 2008). APC examined the 5 miles of the water transmission line route (30 feet
wide or about 18 acres in area) not yet inspected. The area surveyed was in plowed fields adjacent to the
right-of-way of 1 mile sections along both sides of SH86 located east of the intersection of SH86 and
RR2301.A 4 mile long segment south from the intersection of SH86 and RR2301 to the well field was
also inspected by inspected plowed fields. Linear survey was conducted at the rate of ca. 4 miles per day.
Shovel testing was not performed due to 100 percent surface visibility in plowed fields.
Four potential historic house site loci are located west of RR2301. A wind shield survey was
performed and the buildings were viewed from RR2301. Each building was assessed for age and
architectural style and potential eligibility. Although historic in age, no buildings are eligible.
Well Field
All HPAs in the well field section were visited and inspected for previous disturbance, surface
visibility, and evidence of cultural resources. These locales (ca. 5 acres) were one hundred percent
surveyed and include one large playa lake, a small playa lake, and one house site. No alluvial settings

and/or areas with low surface visibility were encountered
Arbitrary survey corridors of 110 feet wide by 640 feet long were examined around the perimeters
of the field where the wells area located. Corridors followed all four sides of the section and one crossed
the center section and southern section. A total of six corridors were examined measuring about 103 acres.
Coverage consisted of systematic parallel pedestrian transects at 10-20 meter intervals The survey rate
was modified to 20 acres per person per day due to high surface visibility and cultivated setting.
Shovel testing was not performed in the well field during the survey due to high surface visibility
and/or previous disturbance. LPAS were viewed, but not intensively surveyed, and included the bulk of
the cultivated areas inside the well field Coverage was more than adequate to apply findings to the entire
section of land.
The proposed well field locale in Section No. 99, Block B-2, Abstract 108, Swisher County
contains two buildings. One is located at the intersection of County Road V and RR 2301. It is not part of
the project area. It is depicted topographic maps and as Building 1 on project maps. The second is on
RR2301 between County Road V and County Road W inside the well field tract. The building locale is
depicted on topographic maps and on project maps as Building 2. It is a twentieth century house and was
inspected, assessed, described, and photographed.
Reporting
All data collected and findings were summarized in this document following Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) report guidelines. Project records will be stored at APC. Hardcopy versions of the
final report will be submitted to the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and distributed to agencies and
university libraries. In addition, as required by the THC, .pdf formats on an archival disc with a Texas
Report Abstract Form will be submitted. Lastly, APC will also provide required GIS shape files to the
agency for the area surveyed and any new cultural resources found.

4.0 SURVEY RESULTS
INTRODUCTION
The result of the cultural resources survey of the City of Silverton Well Field and Water
Transmission Line project area was positive for the well field and negative for the highway easements.
One historic mid-twentieth century dwelling was observed in the well field. Four dwellings in the vicinity
of the proposed water transmission line easement west of RR2301 were observed and it was determined
that although they are 45 years old or older, they are not potentially eligible significant historic properties.
Cultural materials were absent from highway right-of-ways and adjacent plowed fields and the well field
section.
No new prehistoric archeological sites were found around the playa area. The individual who has farmed
the property since 1951 stated that he has never found any artifacts while plowing. The survey yielded
limited new historic data about the cultural history of the Llano Estacado region and eastern Briscoe
County and western Swisher County, but no new data about area prehistory. Findings showed that the
proposed new construction of will not affect any significant cultural resources eligible for listing in the
NRHP and/or as SALs.
Water Transmission Line
The SH86 and RR2301 right-of-ways (ROW) and adjacent plowed fields do not contain any
cultural material. The south side of SH86 was freshly trenched exposing subsurface soils on the surface
(Figure
). No cultural material of any sort was observed, including routine roadside garbage, for the one
mile segment of SH 86 surveyed. The 15-foot wide RR2301 ROW was found to contain vegetation that
obscured the ground surface (Figure 10). For this reason, the ROWs were not intensively inspected.
Instead, unplanted, plowed fields adjacent to the ROW were walked where visibility was 100 per cent.

Well Field
One historic building was observed inside the well field inside Section 99, Block B-2, Abstract No.108,
Swisher County. It is a 1950s-1960s frame dwelling (Figure 8). Architecturally it can be described as
unstyled-altered. The main part of the buildings in 40 by 30 feet standard stick frame covered with
asbestos shingles. One side has an add-on that measures 8 x 8 feet (Figure 9). The rear of the house has
been altered (Figure 10). A small front porch has collapsed. It has a corrugate tin roof, asbestos siding,
modern aluminum windows, and additions that appear to be particle board. A storm cellar is present that
probably dates to the 1950s (Figure 11). All refuse around the house is modern. It is not occupied and
appears to have been vacant, but recently repaired.

RESOURCE SIGNIFICANCE
Evaluation Criteria
Newly found cultural resources are evaluated for their potential to be eligible for federal and state
listing as protected cultural properties. Two sets of eligibility criteria apply to the newly found historic
building inside the well field. The first set is for national listing. The second is for state designation.
Historic buildings may be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, if the
following conditions are met (36CFR800).
The quality of significance of the resource in American history architecture, archeology,
engineering, and/or culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects that
possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association,
and:
A. that are associated with events that have made significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
B. that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C. that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or
that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D. that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information in prehistory or history.
Under the Antiquities Code of Texas, resources that meet the following conditions are eligible for formal
designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
Historic Structures (Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26, Rule 26.15) may be designated if
(1) the structure, or building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places; and
(2) the structure, or building fits within at least one of the following criteria
a. is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history;
b. is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
c. is important to a particular cultural and or ethnic group

d. is the work of a significant architect, master builder, or craftsman;
e. embodies the distinctive characteristic of a type, period, or method of construction,
possesses high aesthetic value, or represents a significant and distinguishable entity
whose components may lack individual distinctions; and/or;
f. has yielded or may be likely to yield information important to the understanding of
Texas cultural or history.
Historic Building Evaluation
The architectural style of the historic building located inside the well field tract does not embody
distinctive characteristics of a type, method of construction, work of a master, and/or that possess high
artistic values. Based on these facts, the building is judged to be ineligible for listing in the NRHP and or
as a SAL. Due to its age of less than one hundred years, the materials around the building are judged not
to be archeological deposits.
DISCUSSION
Survey results were positive, however; no significant archeological sites (pre-1912) or historic
(pre-1967) house sites were found during the survey. One ineligible mid-twentieth century house was
found inside the well field. Cultural materials were not found in the potential water transmission line
right-of-ways. Insignificant historic are buildings are present along the west side of RR2301, however;
they are well outside the TxDOT easements and will not be directly and/or indirectly affected by the
project.
The historic dwelling is near the location were the storage tank and pump station will be built and
could be affected by the proposed project. It is not a significant historic property and does not merit
avoidance. At the time of writing there are no plans to incorporate the building into project plans and/or to
demolish or alter the structure, however; that may be subject to change before the City purchases the tract
and while the building is still in private hands. Due to its twentieth century age, alterations, and
deteriorating condition, incorporation, demolition, or other plans for the building do not require an historic
resources review.
Some of the wells observed inside the well field appear to be historic or about 50 years old. They
were judged to be industrial features rather than archeological or historic sites. The proposed re-casing of
the existing wells will occur in locations that have been previously disturbed by water well drilling and
well field operation and maintenance.
Despite the presence of a small playa lake, the cultural resources survey yielded no new
prehistoric archeological data for the Southern Plains of the Llano Estacado. Prehistoric sites are absent
from the project area. This fact is probably due to a lack of protected campsites locales, reliable water
supplies, chert gravels, and distance to the Prairie Town Fork and the Caprock Canyonlands.
Development of the water well field can proceed without additional cultural resources work.
From a cultural resources management perspective, the well field location is deemed acceptable for
development and ownership by the City of Silverton. The mid-twentieth century historic building inside
the well field is not important to local history and can be demolished without further consultation. The
water line route can be placed in ether side of the highway easements and installation will not affect any
cultural resources because none are present. Re-casing of existing water wells and construction of the
storage tank and booster pump station will not impact any cultural resources.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
CONCLUSIONS
In terms of new construction, the development of the City of Silverton Well Field and Water
Transmission Line project will not affect any cultural resources eligible for the NRHP or SAL listing.
From a research perspective, very limited new knowledge about the region’s twentieth century history
resulted from the survey. Four ineligible twentieth century dwellings are present west of RR2301 and one
is present in a small part of Section 99, Block B-2, Abstract No.108, Swisher County, where the well field
is planned.
The standing historic building present in the well field and in the vicinity of the proposed pump
station and storage tank is not historically and/or architecturally significant and is not old enough to be an
archeological site. The building can be altered and/or demolished without further consultation with the
Texas Historical Commission. Survey data clearly show that Section 99, Block B-2 in Swisher County
does not contain or have the potential to contain any significant cultural resources. The same findings
apply to the right-of-ways on both sides of SH86 and RR2301 right-of-ways examined.
RECOMMENDATIONS
APC recommends that the City of Silverton Well Field and Water Transmission Line project proceed, as
planned, with one standard construction condition. If unexpected archeological deposits are exposed
during construction, digging should stop at the discovery location and APC should be notified, by
telephone at (512) 398-2946. The find should be evaluated by APC archeologists in consultation with the
THC before digging resumes at the location.
