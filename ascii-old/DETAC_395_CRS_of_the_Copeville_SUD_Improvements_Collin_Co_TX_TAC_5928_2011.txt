ABSTRACT
In April 2011, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted
a cultural resource management survey of the proposed Copeville Special Utility District
Improvements in Collin County, Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit #5928 was obtained
and all terms of the permit were carried out as the utility district falls under the
jurisdiction of the Texas Antiquities Code. The survey was also conducted in
cooperation with the Corps of Engineers, Ft. Worth District, as a portion of the proposed
pipeline will cross land managed by the federal agency. Proposed capital improvements
for Copeville SUD include the addition of a 200,000 gallon single pedestal elevated water
storage tank on a one acre lot and 5,702 meters (m) (18,710 feet (ft)) of 30 centimeter
(cm) (12 inch (in)) water distribution pipeline. Total project area was 5.6 hectares (13.9
acres). The proposed pipeline along County Road 555, Business Hwy 78 and US Hwy
78 will be on private property adjacent to TxDOT and railroad right-of-ways. Shovel
testing and visual examination could not find any evidence of cultural resources; no
artifacts were collected. DETAC also examined the project area for the potential for
deeply buried sites. Examination of two profiles found the only buried soils were along
an interfluve between Elm and Tom Bean Creek south of the right-of-way. Daniel
Brown, Inc. will conduct the investigations into visual impacts by the proposed water
tank on nearby NRHP properties.
DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect” on
NRHP eligible properties for the proposed Copeville Water Supply Corporation project
as applied to jurisdiction under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). If dark greasy soils, artifacts, or bones are
encountered during construction, then all excavation should stop and a qualified
archaeologist should be contacted to investigate the site before continuing with the
proposed work.

INTRODUCTION
In April 2011, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC) conducted
a cultural resources survey of the proposed Copeville Water Supply Corporation water
supply improvements in Collin County, Texas (Figure 1).

Proposed capital

improvements for Copeville SUD include the addition of a 200,000 gallon single pedestal
elevated water storage tank on a one acre lot and 5,702 meters (m) (18,710 feet (ft)) of 30
centimeter (cm) (12 inch (in)) water distribution pipeline. The proposed pipeline along
County Road 555, Business Hwy 78 and US Hwy 78 will be on private property adjacent
to TxDOT and railroad right-of-ways. A portion of the proposed water line will cross
Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District property along the Elm Creek floodplain. The
survey was conducted at the request of the Copeville Water Supply Corporation in
compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act. The report was reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
and the Corps of Engineers, Ft. Worth District.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries and explore for buried soils that may contain
cultural resources. The report was prepared following the short report format outlined by
the Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) (2002a) with modifications requested by the
THC (Martin 1999). No cultural resources were found during the survey. Based on the
archaeological fieldwork, DETAC recommends a determination of “no effect” to cultural
resources eligible to the National Register of Historic Places.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The projects include 5,702 m (18,710 ft) of 30 cm (12 in) water distribution
pipeline in a 20 ft permanent easement with a 30 ft construction easement and a proposed
200,000 gallon single pedestal elevated water storage tank on a one acre tract. The total
project area was 5.6 hectares (13.9 acres). The proposed pipeline right-of-way was
staked at the time of the survey. The one acre lot was defined by a fence on all four
sides. Descriptions of topography, vegetation and modern disturbances are included in
the individual segment descriptions.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Collin County has been part of broad studies and investigated in both
larger examinations and in numerous smaller surveys. The larger investigations focused
on salvage surveys for Lake Ray Hubbard in Rockwall County and Lake Lavon in Collin
County. These and subsequent investigations nearby found, tested and conducted data
recovery efforts on a variety of historic and prehistoric sites. The numerous smaller
surveys in the area include both upland and lowland settings and were conducted
primarily for county utility services, e.g., Shelton and others (2009), and roads, e.g.,
Butler (2008) near Lake Lavon.
The closest documented cultural resources surveys to the proposed pipeline and
water tower are three areas surveyed for the Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District. The
surveys are 0.8 kilometers (km) ((0.5 miles), 2.2 km (1.3 miles) and 3.0 km (1.8 miles)
west of the project area. No sites were documented for these three surveys on the Texas
Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2011).
Only one site is within 1.6 km (1.0 miles) of the proposed pipeline.

Site

41COL19 was originally found in 1948 by R. L. Stephenson. The site is located on the
north bank of Elm Creek roughly 145 m (475 ft) north of the project area. The landowner
reported several fragmentary burials and projectile points found during cultivation. No
pottery was reported. No further work was recommended for the site (Stephenson 1948).
Another site, 41COL33, is located approximately 3 km (1.8 miles) west of the
project area along an unnamed tributary of Elm Creek. The site consists of two lithic
knives found through surface inspection during the Texas Archaeology Salvage Project
(Unknown 1964).
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The
documents of primary importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990)
discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Additionally, the THC, Department of Antiquities
Protection developed a document for the eastern Texas portion of the Texas State Plan
(Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). This document includes several historic contexts that
detail a particular facet of northeast Texas prehistory.

This State plan serves to

synthesize the current state of archaeological research in the region and identify problems

3

and objectives to be addressed in future research and cultural resources management
projects. Cultural chronology, aboriginal settlement patterns and subsistence, and historic
continuities are some of the general research directions that these recent studies
emphasize as important for developing future archaeological research designs. More
recently, Fields (2004:347-369) describes the archaeology of the Post Oak Savanna of
East–Central Texas which focuses on work in the Cooper Lake and Jewett Mine. Current
research in the area, published in the Archeological Journal of the Texas Prairie
Savannah, includes a study of A Possible Association Of Worked Flakes With
Proboscidean Bones Near Lake Lavon, Collin County, Texas and The Upper
Farmersville South Site (41COL44): A Small Late Prehistoric Occupation In Collin
County, Texas both by Wilson Cook. 41COL44 is approximately 11 km (6.8 miles) south
the project area.
The occupation of the area includes the Paleo-Indian (pre-700B.C.), Archaic
foraging cultures (ca.700 B.C. – A.D. 800) and Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800) through the
Historic European settlements. Within the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800 – 1680) the
area includes site from the Henrietta phase to the north and west and the Caddo culture to
the south and east. During the Historic period proto-historic populations, e.g., the
Kickapoo were relocated to Oklahoma.
The Paleo-Indian period (ca. 10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile
bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and animals
(Story 1990).

The Archaic (7000 B.C – A.D. 800) refers to hunter-gatherers who

implemented more regionally specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment
(Story 1990). The Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800-1600) of the region includes both
Plains Villagers from the north and west and the Caddoan culture from the east and south
(Crook 2011:16). These later historic cultures exhibited a greater reliance on cultigens
(Brown and Lebo 1990:16) and prolonged occupations at specific locales indicating an
increasingly sedentary lifestyle (Ferring and Yates 1997:6). The local Henrietta Phase
Plains villagers were influenced by Wichita groups of the southern plains while the
Caddo culture was influenced by the Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi
Valley (Story 1990:323). Diagnostic artifacts from both cultures include distinctive types
of pottery (Nocona Plain for Henrietta Phase versus Sanders and Williams Plain for

4

Caddo) and arrow points. The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history
behind the current cultural setting of the area and marks a transition from the native
population’s domination of the area, to the American immigrants establishment of farms,
towns and counties. Collin County was divided from Fannin County on 3 April 1846 as
settlers established small, self-sustaining farms. Moving produce to rivers was costly
until the railroad arrived in the 1870’s connecting the county to larger cities to the north
and south. Productivity increased until the Great Depression. Agriculture rebounded
slowly, expanding the pre-Depression levels of productivity as late as the 1950’s. Today
the area continues to prosper with a mixture of agriculture and industry (THA 2010).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were preformed in compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231,
1970); the Archaeological Protection Act of 1979 (PL96-95; 16 U.S.C. 470aa-mm), The
Texas Antiquities Code, and the guidelines set forth by the CTA (2002b).
The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National
Park Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) for determining eligibility of a cultural resource
to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The objectives of the survey were to
locate prehistoric and historic cultural resources sites within the survey areas. If sites
were found, then the investigations were to delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of
each site, determine each site’s integrity and provide a preliminary evaluation of each
site’s potential for NRHP eligibility.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using maps and files from the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2011). The site
location maps and cultural resources records at Texas Archaeology Research Laboratory
(TARL) were consulted to identify the location, types, and both State Archaeological
Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites within or in close
proximity to the project area.

The Site Atlas was consulted for published and

unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys.

5

DETAC conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area. To locate sites,
the pedestrian survey relied on visual examination and shovel testing.

Visual

examinations were conducted in areas with exposed soil surfaces in a continuous effort
between shovel tests at all locations with exposed surfaces. Shovel testing was conducted
in accordance with the THC’s guidelines for cultural resources surveys. Shovel testing
included excavating an area approximately 30 cm (12 in) in diameter in 10 cm (4 in)
levels down to the clay substrate or 90 cm (35 in). The excavated matrix was screened
through a 0.635 cm (0.25 in) wire mesh screen. The depth, soil type and color of each
shovel test were recorded along with a GPS position.
Daniel Brown, Inc. will conduct the investigations into visual impacts by the
proposed water tank on nearby NRHP properties.

RESULTS
The DETAC survey of the project area is divided into five segments (Figure 2).
Segment 1 describes the southern end of the proposed pipeline and its position next to an
existing TxDot right-of-way and a railway right-of-way. Segment 2 describes a small
section of private land and a section of US Army Corps of Engineers land that is 2.4 km
(1.5 miles). Segment 3 describes 1.6 km (1.0 miles) adjacent to an existing TxDoT rightof-way on private land. Segment 4 describes a one acre tract for the proposed water tower
and a 270 m (885 ft) long segment of pipeline. In addition, two cutbank profiles were
examined along an unnamed tributary to Elm Creek and at the interfluve between Elm
Creek and Tom Bean Creek.

Segment 1
The southern end of the proposed pipeline will be constructed between an existing
railroad right-of-way and an existing highway right-of-way along a wide upland ridge
with three stream channels (Figure 3). The two right-of-ways share a boundary that is
heavily disturbed by cut and fill from construction of both right-of-ways. Vegetation
along the segment is grass and mixed hardwoods. Soils along segment 1 include Heiden
clay and Houston black clay. The three stream channels in this area are intermittent
upland drainages. All three stream channels were in culverts under the railroad and

the pipeline will be placed on cut slopes or in fill areas between the railroad and highway;
no shovel tests were excavated.

Segment 2
Segment 2 extends from the bore under the railroad to a bore under Hwy 78. The
proposed pipeline will cross approximately 0.5 km (0.3 miles) of private property and 1.9
km (1.8 miles) of US Army Corps of Engineers land (Figure 4). The private property is a
pasture and has been disturbed due to agriculture. Soil series were Heiden clay and
Wilson clay loam. Soils were shallow loamy clay twenty centimeters below surface.
Five shovel tests were excavated in this area combined with surface inspection (Figure 4,
Table 1). The surface inspection and shovel testing did not reveal any evidence of past
Prehistoric or Historic period occupations. The portion of the segment across Corps of
Engineers land crosses several ridge toe slopes and the Elm Creek floodplain. This area
is forested with mixed hardwood trees with an understory of shrubs and grasses. The
center line of the right-of-way was cut and staked. A total of 70 shovel tests were
excavated (Figure 3, Table 1). Shovel tests found shallow olive brown, dark brown and
black clay soils between 10 and 30 cm deep to the subsoil. No artifacts were found in
shovel tests or surface inspection. Two stream profiles were cleaned and described to
assess the potential for buried soil horizons; they are described in the Buried Soil
Investigation Section.

Segment 3
For approximately 1.5 km (1 mile) the proposed pipeline will run adjacent to
Texas Highway 78 on the western side along an upland ridge (Figure 5). This section of
the right-of-way is adjacent to the existing TxDoT right-of-way on private land.
Vegetation along the segment was exclusively pasture grasses except for two portions
which were plowed fields and one which was adjacent to a parking lot. Soils along the
segment include Burleson clay and Houston Black clay. Visual inspections were
conducted in the areas with exposed soil. Eight shovel tests were excavated along the

segment (Figure 4, Table 1). Shovel tests ranged from ten to twenty centimeters deep in
black clay. Neither the surface inspection nor shovel testing found any artifacts or
revealed any evidence of past Prehistoric or Historic period occupations.

Segment 4
Segment 4 included a one acre tract for the proposed water tower and a a 270 m
(885 ft) long segment of pipeline (Figure 6). The tract and the pipeline are on the summit
of an upland ridge.

Vegetation is exclusively pasture grass. Six shovel tests were

excavated near the proposed water tower located at the west end of the proposed pipeline.
Shovel testing found dark brown to black loamy clay ranging from ten to twenty cm
below surface. Soils are Heiden clay and Wilson clay loam. Four similar shovel tests
were excavated along the proposed pipeline right-of-way adjacent to F.M. 555 (Figure 5,
Table 1). This section of the pipeline will tie into an existing pipeline. No artifacts were
found in the shovel tests.

Buried Soil Investigations
Buried soil investigations included examining the geologic map for the variety of
surface geologic formations, examining the project area for vertical exposures and
describing observed profiles using standard geologic and pedologic terminology.

The

examination of the geologic map of the area revealed the water tower, associated
pipeline, and the pipeline south of the Elm Creek floodplain are on the Pecan Gap Chalk
(Kpg). The Elm Creek floodplain is Quaternary alluvium (Qal) and the segment of the
pipeline north of Elm Creek is on a Quaternary terrace (Qt) (BEG 1967) (Figure 7).
Pecan Gap Chalk is an indurated glauconitic limestone/sand from the Late Cretaceous.
Soils that formed on this surface include Heiden clay, Houston Black clay, Ferris-Heiden
clay, and Wilson clay loam.

Soils that formed on the Quaternary terrace include

Burleson clay, Houston Black clay, and Heiden clay. Unfortunately, all of the soil series
descriptions for the Pecan Gap Chalk, Quaterary terrace, and Quaternary alluvium are
described as having A/C profiles except for the Wilson series that has an A/B/C profile.

Wilson series soils exist on upland ridge shoulders. The development of a B horizon is
caused by leaching of carbonates and salts while the other soil series have not had enough
time to develop (USDA 1969:50).
Visual examination of creek cutbanks in the Elm Creek floodplain was used to
look for buried soils given the homogeneity of the existing data and the lack of vertical
exposures along the pipeline right-of-way the Quaternary terrace. Geologically, the
floodplain has the greatest potential for intact buried soils and the stream channels
provide cutbanks profiles with depths in excess of the proposed 1.2 m (4 ft) depth of the
trench for the pipeline. The remainder of the pipeline right-of-way was examined for
vertical exposures as well, but none were found beyond isolated areas of slumping on the
backslopes of ridges south of the Elm Creek floodplain.
Two drainage channels were examined for buried soils within the Elm Creek
floodplain (Figure 5). Initially, the cutbanks of an unnamed tributary west of Elm Creek
was cleaned, photographed and were profiled. Second, the cutbanks of the interfluve of
Tom Bean Creek and Elm Creek was examined for buried soils. Both profiles are in
Trinity clay near the boundary between occasionally flooded (To), and frequently flooded
(Tf) mapping units. In general, Trinity clay is a deep calcareous clayey soil found along
major streams and tributaries. The typical profile includes an A horizon roughly 35 cm
(14 in) deep over a C horizon with parallellpipeds below 60 cm (24 in) (USDA 1969:25).
Dry cracks form in the A horizon to at least 50 cm (20 in).
The tributary profile is a 90 cm cutbank that was cleaned, troweled,
photographed, described (Table 1) and illustrated (Figure 8). A total of four horizons
were found. Soil textures were silty clay with variations in color from the amount of
organic material. The C horizon was differentiated from the overlying A horizon by the
presence of thin lenses with varying colors and textures. This profile is the result of soil
formating a single strata. The development of sub-horizons is the result of the amount of
organic material of which the upper horizons have a greater amount than the lower
horizons.

Tom Bean Creek and Elm Creek interfluve profile is a 140 cm cutbank that was
cleaned, troweled, photographed, described (Table 2) and illustrated (Figure 8). The
profile shows two episodes of deposition separated by a sloped abrupt boundary. Strata
1, (a gray silty clay loam,) was deposited and formed a vertisol followed by Strata 2, (a
olive gray silty clay,) which filled the voids in the surface of Strata 1 creating the
intermixed bodies of the 1C/2C horizon.

Strata 2 is the stable surface which has

developed an A horizon at the modern ground surface.

Topographically, the proposed pipeline will cross stable uplands and the Elm
Creek floodplain. Examination of the geologic map and soils information show that
surface geology includes Cretaceous limestone/sand and Quaternary deposits along the
creek floodplain. Soils across the project area have A/C profiles in clayey material.
Examination of two cutbank profiles in the Elm Creek floodplain revealed fewer
depositional episodes further from the larger creek channel and a more dynamic sequence

18

of deposition closer to the larger creek. The interfluve profile has a buried soil, but no
artifacts or evidence of an occupation were found to suggest the proposed project will
impact a buried archaeological site.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed Copeville Water Supply Corporation improvements will include the
construction of an elevated water tank on a one acre property and the construction of
roughly 5,702 m (18,710 ft) of pipeline north of Copeville, Texas.

No previously

recorded archaeological sites will be impacted. The surface inspection, shovel testing,
and profiling of stream cutbanks did not reveal any evidence of past prehistoric or
historic period occupations. If dark greasy soils, artifacts or bones are encountered
during construction, then work should stop in the immediate area. DETAC and the THC
should be contacted immediately.
In conclusion, the investigations did not document any cultural resources. Based
on the investigations, there is little chance of encountering cultural resources in the
project area. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect”
on NRHP eligible properties for the proposed Copeville Water Supply Corporation
project as applied to jurisdiction under the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)
and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).
