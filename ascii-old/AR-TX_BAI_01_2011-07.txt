Between March 23, 2009, and April 10, 2009, at the request of Civil Structures, Inc. (CSI), and on behalf
of the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Dallas District, archeologists from Blanton &
Associates, Inc., conducted intensive archeological surveys of five off-system bridge locations and one
culvert location (hereinafter “bridge locations” or “bridges”) in Navarro County, Texas, prior to the
proposed replacement of each structure and associated roadway improvements. The six locations included
County Road (CR) NE 3010 at Indian Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-093), CR NE 3030 at tributary of Cow Creek
(CSJ: 0918-18-094), CR SE 4060 at Rush Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-097), CR NE 3040 at Indian Creek (CSJ:
0918-18-098, CR NE 3120 at Humphries Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-099), and CR NE 3220 at Grays Creek
(CSJ: 0918-18-101). Augmented by shovel testing and backhoe trenching, investigations discovered no
archeological resources within the proposed construction areas and no artifacts were collected. Curation
was unnecessary.

PROJECT TITLE: Intensive Archeological Survey for Six Proposed Off-System Bridge Replacements
in Navarro County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and an intensive
archeological survey with backhoe trench excavations and shovel testing of five off-system bridge
locations and one culvert location (hereinafter “bridge locations” or “bridges”) in the vicinity of Kerens,
Navarro County, Texas. The six bridge locations included County Road (CR) NE 3010 at Indian Creek
(CSJ: 0918-18-093), CR NE 3030 at tributary of Cow Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-094), CR SE 4060 at Rush
Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-097), CR NE 3040 at Indian Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-098, CR NE 3120 at Humphries
Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-099), and CR NE 3220 at Grays Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-101). All proposed bridge
construction would occur within the existing 46-foot to 77-foot wide prescriptive easements. The Area of
Potential Effect for each crossing included the full width of each easement, the proposed facilities, the
approach roadways, and one proposed drainage easement on CR NE 3010 at Indian Creek. Because each
creek crossing possibly contained recent alluvium with the potential to contain intact buried archeological
deposits, subsurface investigations emphasized backhoe trenching.
PROJECT LOCATION: The six project areas are located in eastern Navarro County in the vicinity of
the City of Kerens: CR NE 3010 at Indian Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-093; Kerens, TX USGS 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle), CR NE 3030 at tributary of Cow Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-094; Kerens, TX USGS
7.5-minute topographic quadrangle), CR SE 4060 at Rush Creek (CSJ: 0918-19-097; Goodlow Park, TX
USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle), CR NE 3040 at Indian Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-098; Kerens, TX
USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle), CR NE 3120 at Humphries Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-099;
Bazette, TX USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle), CR NE 3220 at Grays Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-101;
Styx, TX USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle).

impossible to complete backhoe trenching due to a high water table, the presence of buried utilities, and
impassable roadways; shovel tests were excavated where trenching was not possible. Based on the lack of
archeological deposits within the project areas, Blanton & Associates, Inc. recommends that the proposed
construction be allowed to proceed as planned within the existing prescriptive easements at each of the six
project areas without additional investigations.

Between March 23, 2009 and April 10, 2009 at the request of Civil Structures, Inc. (CSI), and on behalf
of the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Dallas District, archeologists from Blanton &
Associates, Inc. (B&A) conducted intensive archeological surveys of six off-system bridge locations in
Navarro County, Texas prior to proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction
(Figures 1 and 2). The roadways are not the property of TxDOT, rather it is the Controlling Agency by
“Prescriptive Definition” and the proposed construction would occur within the existing 46 to 77-foot
wide prescriptive easements of the following gravel and/or dirt roads: County Road (CR) NE 3010 at
Indian Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-093), CR NE 3030 at tributary of Cow Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-094), CR SE
4060 at Rush Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-097), CR NE 3040 at Indian Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-098, CR NE 3120
at Humphries Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-099), and CR NE 3220 at Grays Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-101). The Area
of Potential Effect (APE) at each crossing included the full width of each easement, the proposed
facilities, the approach roadways, and one proposed drainage easement on CR NE 3010 at Indian Creek.
Due to excessive rainfall in late March 2009 and early April 2009, saturated ground and impassable
conditions of the unpaved roadways greatly impeded survey efforts.
Because the proposed construction would occur on property administered by TxDOT, the project is
subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas
Administrative Code. This legislation requires that any political subdivision of the State of Texas must
identify potential State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) through survey of public lands prior to actions
that could potentially damage those SALs. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) Division of
Archeology administers the code’s provisions. Protection of archeological sites under state law is tied to
eligibility for formal SAL designation pursuant to 13 TAC 26.8. Archeological surveys of public lands
require a Texas Antiquities Permit issued by the THC. Survey investigations were conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 5191 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young. As the project would
utilize funds from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the proposed construction is also
subject to the provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. Consideration of
archeological resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) that depends on criteria defined by National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60.
Investigations complied with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the Department of
the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists
(1987), and survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the Council of Texas
Archeologists (THC n.d.). The intent of the survey was to identify and describe all archeological
resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their potential for nomination to the NRHP or for formal
SAL designation, and should significant cultural resources be discovered, make recommendations for
future resource management options such as avoidance, preservation, or further investigations. All work
was conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the First Amended Programmatic
Agreement among the FHWA, TxDOT, the Texas State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and TxDOT regarding the Implementation of
Transportation Undertakings (PA-TU), as well as the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between
TxDOT and THC.

Navarro County is in the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic region (Fenneman 1931, 1938). Geology of
the six project areas consist of Holocene alluvium (CR NE 3220 at Grays Creek and CR SE 4060 at Rush
Creek), Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits (CR NE 3010 at Indian Creek, CR NE 3030 at tributary of
Cow Creek, and CR NE 3040 at Indian Creek), and the Paleocene age Willis Point Formation of the
Midway Group (CR NE 3120 at Humphries Creek) (Barnes 1972). Holocene Alluvium consists of
floodplain deposits (gravel, sand, silt, and silty clay), the Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits are gravel,
sand, silt, and clay derived from ancient terraces, and the Willis Point Formation is clay, silt, and sand
with mudstone and limestone (Barnes 1972). Regionally, Holocene alluviums have consistently been
shown to have a good potential for containing intact buried archeological deposits. In contrast, the
Paleocene and Pleistocene geology predates known human occupation of the region and have, therefore,
virtually no potential to contain buried intact archeological material.
SOI L S
Soils mapped for the various project locations include: Axtell fine sandy loam (1 to 3 percent slopes) on
CR NE 3030 at tributary of Cow Creek, Gowen clay loam (frequently flooded) on CR NE 3120 at
Humphries Creek and CR SE 4060 at Rush Creek, Trinity clay (frequently flooded) on CR NE 3220 at
Grays Creek, and Wilson clay loam (0 to 1 percent slopes) on CR NE 3010 and CR NE 3040 at Indian
Creek.
Axtel fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, developed from alluvium of mixed origins and consists of
fine sandy loam from 0 to 25 centimeters below ground surface overlying four clay B horizons from 25 to
208 centimeters below ground surface. Gowen clay loam, frequently flooded, is a deep clayey soil that
developed from Holocene alluvial deposits on narrow floodplains. Areas with this soil flood every two to
three years, often resulting in scour channels. A representative profile of Gowen clay exhibits three clay
loam A horizons from 0 to 121 centimeters below ground surface overlying a loam C horizon from 121 to
157 centimeters below ground surface.
Trinity clay, frequently flooded, is deep calcareous clay found on floodplains that formed in alluvial
sediments. A typical profile of Trinity clay, frequently flooded, exhibits four A horizons of very dark gray
to black clay from 0 to 147 centimeters below ground surface. Wilson clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, is
found on stream terraces and developed from Quaternary alluvium of mixed origins. A representative
profile exhibits dark gray to very dark gray clay loam from 0 to 20 centimeters below ground surface
overlying four clay B horizons from 20 to 121 centimeters below ground surface. Below the deepest B
horizon, a clay C horizon extends to at least 150 centimeters below ground surface (Meade et al. 1974).
F L OR A
Navarro County lies in the Texan biotic province, which represents a transitional zone between the
eastern woodlands and the western grasslands (Blair 1950). The province has been divided into four
subregions: the Blackland Prairie and Grand Prairie of the Blackland Prairies region, as well as the Oak
Woodlands and Eastern Cross Timbers of the Oak Woods and Prairies region. The bridge locations
occupy the Blackland Prairie subregion, which primarily supports tall and medium grasses such as little
bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) and hairy tridens (Tridens pilosus), as well as deciduous riparian

(Acer negundo) (Diamond et al. 1987). Land use adjacent to the rural bridge locations is largely
agricultural, though undeveloped acreage is common.

A review of records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and data available on the
THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) was conducted to determine the presence of any
previously recorded sites or previous project areas within a 1,000-meter radius of the APE. The research
indicated that there are no previously recorded archeological sites within a 1,000-meter radius of each of
the six bridges. However, parts of a previous archeological survey conducted in 1999 for the USDA are
within 850 to 1,000 meters of the bridges on CR NE 3010 and CR NE 3040 at Indian Creek. No sites
were discovered adjacent to either bridge (Skinner 1999). Although there are no previously recorded sites
near the six bridges, the density of known sites along and near drainages in other parts of Navarro County
suggests that the proposed construction areas have a good potential for containing archeological material.
The 1940 General Highway Map (Texas State Highway Department 1940) of Navarro County was
reviewed for previous structures and features adjacent to the six bridge locations. There are no structures
immediately adjacent to any of the bridges, though there are structures in the general vicinity of each
bridge. The scale (1 inch = 5,280 feet [1 mile] or 1 inch = 10,560 feet [2 miles]) of the map makes it
difficult to determine the exact location of something as discrete as a previous ranching or agriculturalrelated structure or feature. Survey efforts looked for standing structures and/or structural and feature
remains within and/or adjacent to the six bridges.

B&A conducted an intensive 100 percent pedestrian survey of the six APEs with surface and subsurface
investigations as necessary in accordance with an appropriate research design (developed pursuant to
13 TAC 26.21(d)) and survey methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and
Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) (1987), and the
survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the CTA (THC n.d.). Surface investigations
consisted of an inspection of the ground surface within the APEs, as well as those areas adjacent to and
visible from the APEs. Where possible, cutbank profiles along the creeks were inspected for the presence
of buried archeological deposits.
Given the potential for Holocene alluvium and the presence of alluvial soils at the six bridge locations,
backhoe trenching occurred as necessary based on field conditions. Backhoe trenches were approximately
5 meters (16.4 feet) long, 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) wide, and 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) deep and plotted with a
hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receiver. Following excavations, archeologists immediately
cleaned and examined trench walls to locate any in situ artifacts, cultural features, and/or soil anomalies
in the trench profiles (Figure 3). Stratigraphic units identified in each trench were described in detail on a
B&A geologic profile form. All trenching activities were monitored by an archeologist to avoid any
unnecessary damage to potentially buried archeological deposits. Because of the aforementioned saturated
conditions throughout the APEs, trench excavations were not possible in every quadrant of every creek
crossing (Figure 4). Further, the six bridges and county roads are in narrow prescriptive easements with
ditches and, frequently, buried utilities that prohibited safe backhoe trenching. When trenching was
warranted but not possible due to restricted space and/or saturated conditions, subsurface testing involved
hand-excavated shovel tests.

Shovel tests were 30 centimeters in diameter or on a side and excavated with a standard round point or
square head shovel in arbitrary 20-centimeter levels to a maximum depth of 100 centimeters below
ground surface or until soil characteristics or bedrock preclude deeper excavation. All removed soil was
screened through 0.25-inch wire mesh to ensure artifact recovery. All appropriate data was recorded on a
B&A shovel test form and all shovel test locations were plotted with GPS. The proposed archeological
investigations utilized a no-collection strategy.

The rural dirt and/or gravel roadways occupy narrow (46 to 77 feet wide) prescriptive easements. Erosion
along the banks of the creeks and around the bridge pilings was common. Additional impacts within the
APEs included fence paralleling the roadways, occasional surface and subsurface utilities, and previous
roadway construction (e.g., steep fill sections and roadside ditches). The following discussions proceed
through descriptions of existing and proposed facilities and conditions within the APEs to syntheses of
field investigations. Appendix A provides schematics of the existing bridges and roadway facilities, as
well as proposed construction plans and bridge layouts. Appendix B offers backhoe trench descriptions.
C R NE 3010 A T I NDI A N C R E E K (C SJ : 0918-18-093)
The existing CR NE 3010 easement at Indian Creek is approximately 52 feet wide and contains a 10-foot
wide single-lane dirt roadway (Figures 5 and 6). The existing roadway fill-section and ditches occupy the
majority of the prescriptive easement and APE. The existing bridge is a 33-foot long by 14-foot wide one
lane, three span timber stringer bridge. The proposed bridge would consist of a 40-foot long by 26-foot
wide prestressed concrete slab supported by three 24-inch diameter drilled shafts at each end, allowing for
two 10-foot wide travel lanes with one-foot wide guard rail rails. Rock rip rap would protect the
abutments. The approach roadways to the bridge would be paved for approximately 200 feet from the
eastern end of the bridge and 150 feet at its western end to match the width of the proposed bridge.
Construction would also require a five-foot wide by 220-foot long drainage easement in the northeast
quadrant of the creek crossing between Station Numbers 11+80 and 14+00. The overall APE measures
approximately 390 feet long, a maximum of 52 feet wide, encompasses roughly 0.47 acre, and extends a
maximum depth of 20 to 30 feet below the ground surface for bridge supports. Available engineering
plans indicate that subsurface impacts would not be necessary for the planned approach improvements
(see Appendix A).
Surface and subsurface survey investigations in the APE discovered no archeological resources.
Subsurface testing involved the excavation of one BHT (1) and nine STs (1 through 9) to determine the
presence or absence of buried archeological deposits (Table 1; see Appendix B). Repeated rainfall over
the course of several weeks resulted in standing water and muddy, impassable road conditions that
prevented multiple attempts to access the APE west of Indian Creek with a backhoe. However, road
conditions allowed trenching in the southeast quadrant of the crossing (see Figure 5). Excavations in BHT
1 extended to a maximum depth of 165 centimeters below ground surface. The soil profile exhibited four
broad stratigraphic zones (I through IV) consisting of, from top to bottom, sand and clay construction fill
(0 to 31 centimeters), silt clay loam (31 to 92 centimeters), sandy loam (92 to 158 centimeters), and sandy
basal clay (158 to 165 centimeters). Shovel tests extended to a maximum depth of 95 centimeters below
ground surface. STs 4 through 6 reached basal clay between 50 and 75 centimeters below ground surface
and a high water table (between 75 and 92 centimeters below ground surface) halted excavations in STs 1
through 3 and 7 through 9 (see Table 1).
C R NE 3030 A T C OW C R E E K (C SJ : 0918-18-094)
The existing prescriptive easement along CR NE 3030 is approximately 77 feet wide and contains a single
lane 10-foot wide gravel roadway (Figures 7 and 8). The existing roadway fill-section and ditches occupy

the majority of the prescriptive easement and APE. This bridge is not closed. The existing bridge
measures 28 feet long by 14 feet wide and contains a one lane single span timber stringer bridge with
timber abutments. The proposed bridge would consist of a 40-foot long by 26-foot wide prestressed
concrete slab supported by three 24-inch diameter drilled shafts at each end, allowing for two 10-foot
wide travel lanes with one-foot wide guard rail rails. Rock rip rap would protect the abutments. The
approach roadways to the bridge would be widened and paved for approximately 142.5 feet from the
eastern end of the bridge and 142.5 feet at the western end to match the width of the proposed bridge (see
Appendix A). The overall APE measures approximately 325 feet long, a maximum of 77 feet wide,
encompasses 0.57 acre, and extends an estimated maximum depth of 20 to 30 feet below the ground
surface for bridge supports. Available engineering plans indicate that no subsurface impacts would be
necessary for the planned approach widening (see Appendix A).
Surface and subsurface survey investigations in the APE discovered no archeological resources.
Subsurface testing involved the excavation of one BHT (1) and five STs (1 through 5) in the APE to
determine the presence or absence of buried archeological deposits (Table 2; see Appendix B). Due to the
narrow roadway with ditches and/or a steep sloping fill section, backhoe trenching was not possible in the
northeast, northwest, and southeast quadrants of the crossing; trenching could only be completed in the
southwest quadrant (see Figure 7). BHT 1 was excavated to a maximum depth of 170 centimeters below
ground surface and exhibited three stratigraphic zones (I through III) consisting of sand and clay
construction fill (0 to 42 centimeters), coarse sand (42 to 160 centimeters), and pea gravel (160 to 170
centimeters); at depth the trench began to fill with water and the walls began slumping (see Appendix B).
Shovel tests extended to a maximum depth of 125 centimeters below ground surface. Due to a high water
table, STs 1, 3 and 5 reached the water table between 105 and 120 centimeters below ground surface.
ST 2 reached wet and sticky basal clay at a depth of 57 to 70 centimeters below ground surface, at which
point excavations were halted (see Table 2). No shovel tests were excavated in the northeast quadrant of
the crossing due to a steep sloping fill section and a deep ditch.
C R SE 4060 A T R USH C R E E K (C SJ : 0918-19-097)
The existing prescriptive easement is approximately 46 feet wide and contains a single lane 10-foot wide
dirt and gravel roadway (Figures 9 and 10). The existing roadway fill-section and ditches occupy the
majority of the prescriptive easement and APE. The existing bridge consists of a 58-foot long single span
constructed from the bottoms of railroad box cars supported by steel pipe stringers and beams (Figure 11).
The proposed bridge would consist of 75-foot long single span structure with a 26-foot wide deck
supported by prestressed concrete girders. The deck would allow for a 24-foot wide clear roadway

with two 10-foot wide travel lanes. Three 36-inch diameter drill shafts would support either end of the
bridge, and stone riprap would protect the abutments. The approaches to the bridge would be widened and
paved for approximately 150 feet from the eastern end of the bridge and 150 feet at the western end to
match the width of the proposed bridge. The APE therefore measures approximately 375 feet long, a
maximum of 53 feet wide, encompasses 0.47 acre, and extends an estimated maximum depth of 20 to
30 feet below the ground surface for bridge supports. Available engineering plans indicate that no
subsurface impacts would be necessary for the planned approach widening (see Appendix A).
Surface and subsurface survey investigations in the APE discovered no archeological resources.
Subsurface testing in the APE involved the excavation of four BHTs (1 through 4) (see Figure 9). Trench
excavations extended a maximum depth of 178 centimeters below ground surface with each trench
exhibiting three broad soil zones (I through III). Zone I consisted of disturbed road construction fill that
extended from 0 to as deep as 54 centimeters below ground surface. Below Zone I, each trench contained
a zone of clay loam (Zone II) overlying sandy clay (Zone III). Water seepage began undercutting the
walls of BHTs 1 and 2 at depths of 125 and 170 centimeters, respectively, below ground surface thereby
forcing excavations to halt. Zone II in BHT 2 consisted of alternate bands of sandy clay loam and sandy
loam averaging about 12 centimeters in thickness, within which was evidence of additional micro
banding. The abrupt boundaries between micro bands suggest relatively recent alluvial deposition (see
Appendix B).
C R NE 3040 A T I NDI A N C R E E K (C SJ : 0918-18-098)
The existing prescriptive easement along CR SE 3040 at Indian Creek varies between 30 and 50 feet in
width and contains a single lane 12-foot wide gravel roadway (Figures 12 and 13). The existing bridge
was closed and evidently burned. The proposed bridge would be a 40-foot long single-span prestresssed
concrete slab beam structure approximately 26 feet wide. The deck would provide for two 10-foot wide
travel lanes, two-foot wide shoulders, and one foot of guardrail on each side. Three 24-inch diameter drill
shafts would support each end of the bridge. Riprap would protect the abutments. The approaches to the
bridge will be widened and paved for approximately 100 feet from the eastern end of the bridge and
100 feet at the western end to match the width of the proposed bridge. The overall APE therefore
measures approximately 380 feet long, a maximum of 46 feet wide, encompasses 0.40 acre, and extends
an estimated maximum depth of 20 to 30 feet below the ground surface for bridge supports. Available
engineering plans indicate that subsurface impacts would not be necessary for the planned approach
improvements (see Appendix A).
Surface and subsurface survey investigations in the APE discovered no archeological resources.
Subsurface testing involved the excavation of one BHT (1) and seven STs (1 through 7) in the APE to
determine the presence or absence of buried archeological deposits (Table 3; see Appendix B). Due to the

narrow roadway with ditches and/or a steep sloping fill section, backhoe trenching was not possible in the
northwest, southeast, and southwest quadrants of the crossing (see Figure 12). BHT 1 was excavated
northeast quadrant of the APE to a maximum depth of 100 centimeters below ground surface and
exhibited three stratigraphic zones (I through III) consisting of sand and clay construction fill (0 to
16 centimeters), sandy clay loam (16 to 44 centimeters), and sandy basal clay (44 to 100 centimeters).
Shovel tests extended to a maximum depth of 80 centimeters below ground surface. Due to a high water
table, STs 2 through 5 began filling with water between 55 and 75 centimeters below ground surface (see
Table 3). ST 1 reached wet and sticky basal clay at a depth of 64 to 75 centimeters below ground surface,
at which point excavations were halted.
C R NE 3120 A T H UM PH R I E S C R E E K (C SJ : 0918-18-099)
The existing prescriptive easement along CR NE 3120 at Humphries Creek is approximately 70 feet wide
and contains a single lane 12-foot wide gravel roadway (Figures 14 and 15). The existing 84-inch
diameter steel pipe culvert (Figure 16) would be replaced by two seven by 10-foot box culverts with
parallel concrete wingwalls approximately 84 feet long and 72 feet long. Overall width of the culvert
would be 38 feet to support a roadway width of 24 feet. The overall APE measures approximately
325 feet long, a maximum of 70 feet wide, encompasses 0.52 acre, and extends an estimated maximum
depth of 10 feet below the ground surface for the culvert. Available engineering plans indicate that
subsurface impacts would not be necessary for the planned approach improvements (see Appendix A).
Surface and subsurface survey investigations in the APE discovered no archeological resources. Repeated
rainfall over the course of several weeks resulted in impassable road conditions that prevented multiple
attempts to access the APE with a backhoe. As such, subsurface testing involved the excavation of 11 STs
(1 through 11) to determine the presence or absence of buried archeological deposits. Shovel tests
extended to a maximum depth of 47 centimeters below ground surface and terminated in basal clay
(Table 4).

The existing prescriptive easement along CR NE 3220 at Grays Creek is approximately 70 feet wide and
contains a single lane 12-foot wide dirt roadway (Figures 17 and 18). The existing bridge is a 66-foot long
and 14-foot wide four span timber stringer bridge with a timber deck and steel and timber substructure.
The proposed bridge would consist of an 80-foot long structure consisting of two 40-foot long spans of

prestressed slab beams supported by three drilled shafts. Overall width of the deck would be 26 feet,
allowing for two 10-foot wide travel lanes and one foot of guardrail on each side. The roadway would be
widened and tapered to the existing roadway for 145 feet on the north end and 140 feet on the south
end. The APE measures approximately 365 feet long, a maximum of 70 feet wide, encompasses 0.59
acre, and extends an estimated maximum depth of 20 to 30 feet below the ground surface for bridge
supports. Available engineering plans indicate that subsurface impacts would not be necessary for the
planned approach improvements (see Appendix A).
Surface and subsurface survey investigations in the APE discovered no archeological resources.
Subsurface testing involved the excavation of four BHTs (1 through 4) to determine the presence or
absence of buried archeological deposits. Trench excavations extended to a maximum depth of
242 centimeters below ground surface. Soil profiles exhibited three or four broad stratigraphic zones
(I through IV). BHTs 1 through 3 contained three zones consisting of, from top to bottom, sand and clay
construction fill, silt clay, and silt clay. BHT 4 exhibited a fourth zone of sandy clay from 215 to
242 centimeters below ground surface (see Appendix B).

SUM M A R Y A ND R E C OM M E NDA T I ONS
Intensive archeological survey efforts on CR NE 3010 at Indian Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-093), CR NE 3030
at tributary of Cow Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-094), CR SE 4060 at Rush Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-097), CR NE
3040 at Indian Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-098, CR NE 3120 at Humphries Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-099), and CR
NE 3220 at Grays Creek (CSJ: 0918-18-101) discovered no archeological resources. Surface
investigations revealed that the existing narrow prescriptive easements have been disturbed by erosion,
subsurface utilities, and roadway construction. The easements at the creek crossings also contain sloping
fill sections with ditches that greatly restricted mechanical subsurface testing. Subsurface investigations
revealed dense clay alluvial soils overlain by disturbed construction fill and road base. Examinations of
trench profiles revealed that recent alluvium was not common, as it has eroded or been truncated by road
construction.
Based on the above data, it is the opinion of B&A that there is little to no potential for the six APEs to
contain previously unidentified archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16[1]) or SALs (13 TAC
26.12). B&A recommends therefore that the proposed construction should be allowed to proceed as
planned in the six APEs without additional investigations, as survey efforts discovered no archeological
resources and previous levels of disturbance within the APEs are not conducive to the preservation of
archeological deposits so the proposed construction should not affect any SALs or archeological historic
properties pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4(d)(1).
If it is determined that TxDOT requires additional easements or work space for the proposed construction,
then additional archeological investigations would be necessary in those areas. In the event that
previously unidentified cultural materials are discovered during construction, work in the immediate area
of discovery would cease and the TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate accidental
discovery procedures in accordance with the aforementioned PA-TU and MOU.
