Abstract
This report detai Is the results of the final three seasons of
archeological investigations conducted under the auspices of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, at Aqui I la Lake in Hill
County, Texas. The first of the three seasons was undertaken in 1978
by a team of archeologists from Southern Methodist University (SMU).
The Texas Archeological Survey (TAS) of The University of Texas at
Austin conducted the investigations in 1980 and 1982. A total of 23
sites was included in the study. The report is organized into seven
sections spread across three volumes.
Volume I contains three
sections:
an introduction, a section detailing investigations at
sites which saw only limited work, and a section on investigations at
upland sites in the project area. Volume II consists of sections on
sites on high alluvial terraces and on the floodplain.
The final
volume holds various syntheses and interpretive chapters as wel I as a
proposed research design for the general area. These are followed by
a series of appendices which report the miscellaneous aspects of the
project and contain a number of data tables not in the text.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION

David 0. Brown

Aqui I la Lake, a reservoir project of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, is in central Hi I I County a few miles southwest of
Hillsboro, Texas. The dam impounding the lake is an earth fil I
structure, nearly a half mile in length, at mi le 23.3 on Aquilla
Creek, just below the confluence of Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks. The
lake began holding water in the Spring of 1983. The stated purposes
of the lake construction include flood control, recreation and water
supply for towns in the surrounding area. Both Hi I lsboro and Itasca
municipal water systems wi I I receive water from the lake.
The normal conservation pool of the lake, at an elevation of
537.5 feet above mean sea level (MSL), wil I inundate 3280 acres of
land, while at maximum flood stage, at 556 feet MSL, the lake wi II
cover 7000 acres. The archeological project area, which includes some
additional Corps of Engineers owned land surrounding the flood pool,
is slightly larger than this latter figure.
Archeological survey of the project area was conducted 1n 1972
(Skinner and Henderson 1972) and in 1975 (Lynott and Peter 1977) by
Southern Methodist University (SMU).
Originally, 125 prehistoric
sites were recorded by SMU in the various proposed lake and damsite
areas. This number was narrowed to 96 when the present damsite was
selected.
A brief summary of the 1982-83 Texas Archeological Survey
(TAS) reassessment and relocation of these sites is presented in
Site testing was undertaken by SMU in 1975 (Lynott and
Appendix I.
Peter 1977) and in 1977 (Skinner et al.
1978).
These two reports
detail the results of testing at 29 sites in the Aqui Ila Lake area.
SMU undertook one season of extensive testing in 1978 (Skinner et
al. ms.
and this report) in accordance with U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers contract DACW63-77-C-0093. Field work was supervised by
Daniel E. McGregor. The 1978 data, previously reported in Skinner et
al. (ms.), has undergone reanalysis using definitions and laboratory
procedures set up by TAS in 1980 in order to provide compatible data
1-1

INTRODUCTION
for an overview of the mitigation project.
This reanalysis was
conducted by Duane E. Peter of North Texas State University during
1981 and 1982 and is reported here in the chapters authored by him.
Subsequent to the 1975 testing program, one of the better
preserved sites in the Aquil la Lake area, the McKenzie site (41HI115),
was nominated to and subsequently placed upon the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP).
In December of 1978, 25 prehistoric sites
within the limits of the project area were determined eligible for the
NRHP as part of the Aquilla Reservoir Multiple ~esource Area. By May
of the following year, a Memorandum of Agreement was signed which
accepted a general plan of preservation, surface collection and
excavation as an effective mitigation effort.
In 1979, the Texas Archeological Survey began the mitigation
project.
The TAS work was conducted under U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers contract DACW63-79-C-0160, originally approved 28 September,
The Scope of Work under which this initial investigation was
1979.
carried out is included here as part of Appendix II.
The initial
season of fieldwork, under the supervision of Richard P. Watson with
David S. Dibble as Principal Investigator, was launched in November of
1979 and continued through January of 1980. Laboratory analysis of
these materials was completed in August of 1980, by which time
preparation of the initial draft report was wel I underway.
The second season of work by TAS, approved on 15 January, 1982,
was undertaken under Modification POOOOl to the existing TAS contract.
The Scope of Work for this subsequent season of investigations is also
included in Appendix II. This project, under the field supervision of
David 0. Brown, was in the field from the last of January until the
first part of June 1982.
Final lab work, initially under the
supervision of Laura Trawick, commenced in June of 1982 and extended
until the first part of 1983, with Jan Guy replacing Ms. Trawick as
lab supervisor in the fal I of 1982.
The present report combines the last season of excavations by SMU
with all of the TAS excavations. In all, investigations at 23 sites
(including 15 of the 25 sites which form the Aquilla Reservoir
Multiple Resource Area) are detailed here, ranging in intensity of
investigation from a single shovel test to three seasons of intensive
controlled excavation. The level of investigation planned for various
sites is given in the Scope of Work (Appendix II), while any
departures from planned investigations are detailed in the section
introductions and individual chapters.
Locations of the sites
investigated during the latter phases of the Aqui Ila Lake Project are
shown in Figure 1.1 and included in the subsequent volumes for
convenience of reference.

INTRODUCTION

The chapters of this report are divided into seven sections which
are contained in three separate volumes. The contributions of each
author are credited by chapter. Included at the begining of Volume I
is a I isting that correlates the site numbers given by SMU with those
given by TARL for the same site (Table 1.1). Listed at the end of the
table are those sites recorded by TARL but not by SMU. Volume I also
contains the environmental and cultural background of the project,
fol lowed by a section describing a series of sites where only I imited
archeological work was conducted. The final section of this volume
describes
excavations and surface collections at sites located
primarily on upland landforms. Several organizational schemes were
initially experimented with for this report, with a division along
simple landform categories providing the most coherent and logical
structure.
Thus,
Volume
II contains the remaining two site
description sections, detai I ing terrace and floodplain sites.
The
final volume contains the conclusions chapters as wel I as the
bib I iography and appendices. The final appendix contains a number of
data tables composed for the analysis and draft reports which were not
included in the final text to reduce the bulk of tables not directly
relevant to discussions in the text. The chapters describing the
1979-1980 TAS investigations, authored by Richard P.
Watson, are
taken from his 1982 doctoral dissertation at The University of Texas
at Austin.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENT IN THE AQUILLA LAKE AREA

David 0. Brown and Richard P. Watson

CLIMATE
Hi I I County 1 s climate can be described as humid subtropical.
According to Russel I 1 s (1945) modification of Koppen 1 s climatic
classification system, the Aqui I la Lake area lies on the boundary
between the Cfd climate regime of western East Texas and the Cwd
climate of North Central Texas and the Balcones Escarpment region.
The Cfd
climate
is
mesothermal in al I years with adequate
precipitation in al I seasons and occasional dry years.
The Cwd
climate 1s mesothermal in al I years with a dry season in winter and
occasional desert years.
Russel I 1 s adaptation of
this
system
classifies climates on the basis of frequency of occurrence of coldest
month temperatures. A mesothermal temperature regime has coldest
month temperatures between 32 and 64.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
As categorized by Carr (1967), who emphasizes the link between
climatic regimes and physiographic regions, Hi II County fal Is within
the North Central Texas climatic division of the Interior Region. The
seven divisions that compose the Interior Region are combined on the
basis of their common seasonal rainfal I characteristics, i.e., May and
September
rainfal I maxima.
An examination of the individual
precipitation curves for the seven divisions shows that the North
Central Texas division has strong similarities to the adjacent East
Texas region curve, differing primarily in the total amount of
rainfal I.
In addition, Hi I I County is located on the boundary of the
East Texas region, an area characterized by generally high annual
rainfal I but summer droughts. Average monthly precipitation for Hi II
County is shown in Figure 2.1.
An examination of the average monthly precipitation graph for
Hi I I County, compared to the East Texas and North Central Texas
climatic division averages (Fig. 2.1), indicates that Hill County is
nearly identical to the North Central Texas division mean with the
exception of the late summer-early fal I maximum.

precipitation for Hi I I County, at 34.13 inches, is also closer to the
North Central Texas average (32.93 inches) than that of East Texas
(45.96 inches).
Nearly al I of the precipitation 1n Hi I I County is rainfal I;
average snowfal I is only 1.3 inches per year 1 and 70 percent of the
winters have no measurable snowfal I (Brooks 1978). The rainfal I peaks
in spring and fal I are primarily due to the overriding of southward
moving cold, arctic air masses by warm, moist gulf air masses, brought
northward by prevai I ing southerly winds.
During the winter, the
prevailing north winds do not al low encroachment of moisture laden air
masses from the Gulf of Mexico and hence the low precipitation.
During the summer, there are no incursions of cold air masses to force
the
wet
gulf
air
masses
upward, although localized summer
thunderstorms are not uncommon.
Temperatures in Hi I I County are generally mi Id with hot summers.
The monthly variation is shown in Figure 2.2. Frost-free growing
season ranges from 214 days in nine out of ten years to 271 days in
one year in ten. Last frosts are rarely later than early Apri I and
early frosts seldom earlier than late October (Brooks 1978).

GEOMORPHOLOGY/GEOLOGY
Hi I I County I ies on the West Gulf Coastal Plain near its western
margin (Fenneman 1938). The Aqui I la Lake area is located on the first
major cuesta east of the Edwards Plateau, between the Edwards
Escarpment at the western edge of the Grand Prairie and the White Rock
Escarpment of the Black Prairie. The geological formations mapped in
the area surrounding Aqui I la Lake are shown in Figure 2.3, adapted
from Barnes (1970, 1972).
West of the study area, the Brazos River marks the Edwards
Escarpment and the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. North of
Waco, the escarpment is less pronounced than it is further to the
south and west, and is virtually free of the intense faulting that
characterizes the Balcones Escarpment south of Austin.
West of the
Brazos at Lake Whitney, the underlying bedrock is composed of Lower
Cretaceous I imestones and clays of the Edwards Plateau, including
formations belonging to the Fredericksburg and Washita groups (Barnes
1970; 1972; Sellards, Adkins and Plummer 1981). East of the river
in this area are smaller outcrops of the more recent Lower Cretaceous
formations, including the Edwards and Comanche Peak I imestones of the
Fredericksburg Group, that form the steep, highly dissected I imestone
bluffs along the Brazos at Lake Whitney.

ENVIRONMENT

Overlying the Fredericksburg Group are a number of formations
belonging to the Lower Cretaceous Washita Group, including the Pawpaw
Formation and Main Street Limestone (which farther to the south form
the upper members of the Georgetown Limestone). East of the Main
Street Limestone lies an outcrop of Grayson Marl, correlated with the
Del Rio Clay found to the south and west (Sellards, Adkins and Plummer
1981). In this area, the Washita Group formations form the underlying
sediment of the Washita Prairie, a subdivision of the Grand Prairie
marked by low rolling hil Is and gently sloping uplands (Brooks 1978).
Little Aqui I la Creek, one of the major tributaries of Aquil la Creek,
heads within the Grayson Formation, described by Barnes (1970) as:
Mostly clay, some thin lenticular beds of highly calcareous
siltstone, some thin I imestone beds composed mostly of
pelecypods, some beds of ocherous hematite, massive, blocky,
medium
gray;
weathers light gray to yellowish gray;
thickness 70-90 feet.
East of the Grayson Marl lies the Woodbine Formation whose sandy
sediments mark the Eastern Cross Timbers, a more heavily dissected
rolling hi I I terrain covered with scrub oak forest.
Al I of Aquilla
Creek within the project area and most of its main stem I ie within the
Woodbine and the Eastern Cross Timbers. Barnes (1970) describes the
Woodbine as:
Sandstone, some clay and shale.
Upper
part,
mostly
sandstone, fine grained, wel I sorted, in part tuffaceous,
ripple marked, large scale cross-bedding, reddish brown;
near top some sandstone with large discoid concretions,
medium to coarse grained, friable; some shale, jarositic,
gray,
fissile;
some marine megafossi Is, oyster reefs
locally.
Middle part, mostly sandstone, fine grained,
cross-bedded; some interbeds of clay, carbonaceous, in part
sandy, gray to brown. Lower part, interbedded sandstone and
clay;
sandstone, fine grained, very thinly bedded to
massive, some beds of ironstone and ironstone conglomerate,
white, red, brown; clay, sandy, gray to brown; channeled
locally. Thickness 175-250 feet, thickens northward.
East of the Woodbine I ies the Eagle Ford Group, the underlying
sediment of the Eagle Ford Prairie, the easternmost of the Black
Prairie (Fenneman 1938). Most of the Hackberry Creek drainage lies
within Eagle Ford group sediments. North of the Aqui Ila Lake area,
Cottonwood Creek, a major tributary of Aqui I la Creek, drains the
western edge of the Eagle Ford. In the Aqui I la Lake area, the Eagle
Ford is divided into the lower Lake Waco and the overlying South
Bosque formations. According to the geologic map, within the project
2-5

ENVIRONMENT
area, the Lake Waco Formation is found primarily north and west of
Hackberry Creek and the South Bosque Formation to the east. Barnes
(1970) describes the Lake Waco as:
Limestone and shale; I imestone forms top and bottom units
of formation;
shale, calcareous, bentonitic, interbedded
with thin beds of hard I imestone that are less abundant
upward; thickness 25-60 feet, thins upward.
The South Bosque Formation (Barnes 1970) is described as:
mostly shale, bentonitic 1n lower
Shale and limestone;
part,
soft, blocky, homogeneous, dark gray to black,
weathers medium gray to yellowish brown;
I imestone beds
scarce, more abundant downward, f laggy; thickness 30-150
feet, thins southward.
Sti I I farther east I ies the Austin Chalk, whose western edge
forms the White Rock Escarpment and whose central portion forms the
middle section of the Black Prairie (Fenneman 1938).
The headwaters
of Hackberry Creek and many of its smal I eastern tributaries extend
upward into the Austin Chalk. Thus, although it does not outcrop
within the Aqui I la Lake area, it has provided fine grained calcareous
sediments for deposition within the lake area. Given the escarpment
separating the Austin Chalk from the Eagle Ford group and the minimal
encroachment of the Hackberry Creek drainage into the former, it has
not been a major source of sediments deposited downstream. Barnes
(1972) describes the Austin Chalk as:
Upper and lower parts, chalk, mostly microgranular calcite,
some
interbeds and partings of calcareous clay, thin
bentonitic beds locally in lower part, lower part forms
light gray.
Middle part, mostly
westward-facing scarp;
thin-bedded marl with interbeds of massive chalk, locally
burrowed,
marcasite-pyrite nodules common, light gray.
Weathers white, marine megafossi Is scarce, thickness 300-500
feet, thins southward.
Farther to the east of the Austin Chalk are the more recent Upper
Cretaceous clays, marls and sands that form the eastern sections of
the Black Prairie (Fenneman 1938). Much of the eastern portion of
Hi I I County is underlain by the Taylor Marl (Brooks 1978), which
Fenneman (1938) associates with the Taylor Prairie.

ENVIRONMENT
SOILS
Two maJor classes of soi Is in the Aqui I la Lake area are those
derived from the Woodbine Formation and those derived from the Eagle
Ford Formation. The former are of a sandier texture than the latter
and support significantly different vegetation.
These two groups
coincide with the distribution of the two major biotic zones found
within the lake area, the Eastern Cross Timbers and the Blackland
Prairie. A smal I portion of the Grand Prairie occurs along the
extreme northwest margin of the Lake area, and is largely coincident
with the occurrence of Grayson Marl parent material.
The soi Is of the Aqui I la Lake area can be further broken down
into four major categories: deep to moderately deep, clayey prairie
soi Is; deep, loamy prairie soi Is; deep, sandy, and loamy savannah
soi Is;
and deep, loamy, and clayey alluvial soi Is (Brooks 1978).
Figure 2.4 shows the distribution of these associations.
The deep to moderately deep, clayey prairie soi Is are represented
by the Houston Black, Heiden, and Ferris soi Is in the Aqui I la Creek
drainage and by the Houston Black, Heiden, Altoga, and Ferris soils in
the Hackberry Creek drainage. In the Aquil la Creek drainage, these
soi Is are confined to the eastern uplands and a smal I area between the
confluence of Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks.
This group of soi Is
composes the vast majority of al I soi Is found 1n the Hackberry
drainage, covering large areas from the uplands to the lower terraces.
The Hi II County soi Is survey describes these soi Is as:
.. nearly level to moderately steep, moderately alkaline
soi Is on the prairie. Slopes are mainly less than 3 percent
but range to as much as 20 percent along the sides of the
drainageways.
The surface layer and underlying layers are clayey.
Deep, wide cracks form in the surface layer when the soi I is
dry. Water enters the soi Is rapidly through the cracks, but
when the soi I is wet and the cracks have been sealed, water
enters the soi Is very slowly. The underlying layers shrink
and
swell with wetting and drying.
These soi Is are
moderately wel I drained to wel I drained.
They are very
slowly permeable to moderately permeable (Brooks 1978:5).
The deep, loamy prairie soi Is are represented by the Normangee,
Wilson,
and Crockett soi Is in both the Aqui I la and Hackberry
drainages.

2-7

ENVIRONMENT
These are nearly level to gently sloping, mi Idly
alkaline to medium acid soi Is on the Prairie. Slopes range
from 0 to 5 percent.
These soi Is have a loamy surface layer and clayey
underlying layers.
Water enters the loamy surface layer
readily but moves slowly through the underlying layers. The
clayey layers shrink and swel I with wetting and drying.
These soi Is are moderately wel I drained to somewhat poorly
drained. They are very slowly permeable (Brooks 1978:6)

ENVIRONMENT
These soi Is occur primarily along the upland margins and slopes to the
west of Aqui I la Creek near its confluence with Hackberry Creek.
Brooks (1978) associates these soi I types with the Grayson Marl rather
than the Woodbine Formation.
The Gasi I, Konsi I, Crosstel I, Bastsil, Travis and Silstid soils
represent the deep, sandy, and loamy savannah soi Is found in the
Aqui I la Creek drainage. With the exception of the Crosstel I and
Bastsi I soi Is, these same soi Is compose the savannah soi Is of the
Hackberry Creek drainage. The vast majority of these soi Is are found
within the Aqui I la Creek drainage and along the western margin of the
Hackberry Creek drainage where the parent material is derived from the
Woodbine Formation.
These are nearly level to strongly sloping, mi Idly alkaline
to slightly acid soi Is on the prairie. Slopes range from 0
to 12 percent.
These soi Is have a surface layer of fine sandy, loamy
fine sand, or fine sandy loam. The underlying layers are
mostly sandy clay loam but range from clay to fine sand.
Most
of
these
soi Is
are moderately permeable, but
permeability ranges from very slow to rapid (Brooks 1978:8).
Pursley clay loams and Tinn clays comprise the deep, loamy and
clayey alluvial soi Is found in the Aqui Ila and Hackberry drainages.
The Pursley clay loam soi Is are confined exclusively to the Aqui Ila
drainage and to those secondary tributaries of Hackberry Creek that
drain areas of Woodbine Formation sandstones, clays and shales.
The
Tinn clay soi Is are developed on calcareous clayey alluvium derived
from areas of Eagle Ford limestones, shales and bentonite materials.
VEGETATION
Three major biotic zones occur 1n the Aqui I la Creek drainage:
the Blackland Prairie, the Eastern Cross Timbers, and the Grand
Prairie. The greater part of the proposed lake area, including most
of Aqui I la Creek, I ies within the I imits of the Eastern Cross Timbers
zone (Flook 1972:161). A large part of the remainder, including most
of the east bank and al I of the upper end of Hackberry Creek, I ies
within the Black land Prairie, while only the upper end of Little
Aqui I la Creek cuts through the Grand Prairie zone. The confluence of
these zones provided the prehistoric inhabitants with ready access to
a wide range off loral and faunal resources.

2-9

ENVIRONMENT
The climax vegetation of the Blackland Prairie, corresponding to
the soils formed in Eagle Ford Group sediments and the Upper
Cretaceous chalks and marls east of the lake area, was dominated by a
variety of grasses including Stipa leucotricha (Texas wintergrass) and
Andropogon sp. (bluestem). As noted, the Grand Prairie includes only
a smal I part of the upper Aqui I la Creek drainage. This biotic zone is
closely correlated with soi Is formed in the sediments of the Lower
Cretaceous Washita Group. Dyksterhuis (1946) characterizes this area
as part of the true prairie association as defined by Weaver and
Clements (1938).
The principal dominants of this association, as
described by Dyksterhuis (1946) from relict areas, are Andropo~on sp.
(bluestems), various perennial forbs - principally Legum1noseae,
Compositae, Scrophulariaceae, and Labiatae - and a variety of annual
grasses.
There has been
some disagreement
with
regard
to
the
characterization
of
the
Cross Timbers climax vegetation.
As
originally defined, Tharp (1926) considered the dominants to be oaks
and hickories, although the latter are restricted to the northern
parts of the Cross Timbers and are not present in this study area.
Weaver and Clements (1938) and Dyksterhuis (1948), however, believe
the endemic dominants to be grasses, primarily Little Bluestem
Schizach rium scoparius), Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerandi) and
Indian grass Sor hastrum avanaceum) that occur in a savannah-I ike
formation with scattered oaks.
From the economic perspective of a
group exploiting this region, the difference between these two
reconstructions would probably be more one of quantity than of kind.
Each of these three major biotic zones can be further subdivided
into
two microenvironments.
The uplands contain the botanical
community from which the biotic zone is defined, but a bottomland
forest also occurs along the margins of the permanent streams and
those intermittent drainages that contain sufficient water to support
tree growth.
A recent botanical study (Slack and Marcy 1983) has
subdivided the Aqui I la Lake area into a number of microenvironments
and attempted quantification of their distribution and the resource
diversity within them. This study of the modern environment found the
greater part of the area to be cropland, pasture and otherwise
disturbed by modern agricultural practices.
Comparison of
the
remaining habitats shows riparian woodland totals only 687.3 acres in
comparison to 3,203.1 acres of upland forest, parkland and savannah.
Upland forests, composed primarily of Mesquite, Oak and Cedar Elm
Woodlands, were the predominant microhabitat, comprising a total of
1592.2 acres in the project study area (Slack and Marcy 1983:26,27).

2-10

ENVIRONMENT
FAUNAL RESOURCES
Blair (1950) has included the Aqui I la Lake area in his Texan
biotic province.
He admits, however, that this province, with no
endemic vertebrate species, is a transitional region between the
Austroriparian province to the east and the Balconian and Kansan to
the west. Nonetheless, there are important differences in the faunal
resources avai I able within the various biotic zones described above,
and perhaps even more important distinctions between the specific
microhabitats defined during the Texas A l M botanical study (Slack
and Marcy 1983). This study found overal I and seasonal differences in
microhabitat preferences for avian species, with the greatest species
diversity occurring in the riparian forest. Riparian woodland, on the
other
hand, was second in capture success for smal I mammals,
superseded only by results from modern cropland.
Most of the large mammals observed in transect sampling were from
the upland forest area, although these figures are apparently biased
by the preponderance of this habitat. Excluding cropland sightings,
some interesting observations can be made. Riparian forest comprises
approximately one-sixth of al I non-agricultural and non-disturbed
land.
This ratio is close to the percentage of cottontai I rabbits,
the most commonly sighted large mammal in each of these zones. On the
other hand, no jackrabbits, no armadi I los and only one skunk in 16
were observed in the riparian zone. A third of the coyotes, one of
two opossums and single occurrence observations of both mountain lion
and whitetai I deer were in the riparian woodland microhabitat.
Al I of these figures, most of them too smal I to provide a
meaningful statistical sample, are based on modern data which may be
of little appl icabi I ity to the available prehistoric fauna I resources.
There are indications, for example, both in excavation data and in
conversations with older residents, that white-tailed deer were much
more common in aboriginal and historic times than they are today. It
is also difficult to
estimate
the
relative
percentages
of
microhabitats that would have been available in prehistory.
PALEOENVIRONMENT
Within the last decade, there has been some discussion of the
intensity, duration and tim~ng of Texas paleoenvironmental changes.
Theories range from the rather gradual warming trend of Bryant and
Shafer (1977) to periodic osci I lat ions which may have had a more
dramatic effect on human culture (Gunn 1979). Preliminary indications
from both the archeological (Di I lehay 1974) and geological records
(Baker and Penteado-Orel lana 1977) suggest that some fluctuations did
occur, despite the apparent stability of the Holocene pollen record.
2-11

ENVIRONMENT
Bryant (1977) and Bryant and Shafer (1977) propose a gradual
uni I ineal change toward a warmer and drier environment for Central
Texas from the Late Ful !glacial to some time before 3000 years ago
when the modern vegetation became established:
The termination of the Altithermal period is not clearly
defined in the pollen record of either the Boriack or
Hershop Bog and it is not characterized by the sharp
increases in the AP-NAP [arboreal pol len-nonarboreal pollen]
ratio. The pollen evidence does not imply a sudden or major
climatic shift toward either a more mesophytic vegetational
composition or a more mesic climate immediately fol lowing
the close of the Al ti thermal. Instead, the post-Altithermal
fossi I pollen record suggests that the Central
Texas
vegetation,
and
by inference, the climate, continued
unchanged unti I the present time (Bryant 1977:153).
This reconstruction 1s not universally supported,
however.
Di I lehay
(1974),
in an analysis of the temporal and spatial
distribution of bison remains from archeological and paleontological
sites, suggested a correlation between the presence of bison on the
southern Plains with climatic fluctuations (see also Greer 1976;
If the appearance and disappearance of bison are
Lynott 1980b).
correctly related to changes in climate, then significant shifts
during the past 10,000 years contradict Bryant and Shafer's hypothesis
of gradual uni lineal change.
Baker and Penteado-Orel lana (1977),
using geomorphic data from the Colorado River in Central Texas, have
also suggested significant fluctuations in the Late Pleistocene and
Holocene climate of Texas (Fig. 2.5).
On the basis of biosi I icate remains, Robinson (1979)
has
developed a model of fluctuating climates from South Central Texas.
Robinson found a decrease in arboreal plant phytol iths in his coastal
plain study site during the Altithermal/Hypsithermal period, fol lowed
by a recovery during the Subboreal and succeeding climatic periods
(after ca. 3,500 BP).
He suggests a mesic interval, with increased
arboreal and tal I grass phytoliths occurring around 3,000 BP,
corresponding with the beginning of Baker and Penteado-Orellana's
(1977) Phase 4 mesic interval.
He also records a brief mesic
interlude during the mid-Altithermal cold spike around 5,500 BP
(Robinson 1979:110).
Dering's (1979) work with the pollen and plant macrofossils from
Hind's Cave in the Lower Pecos region i I lustrates some trends in
vegetation change but I ittle that
could
be
termed
cyclical
fluctuations.
Because
of

interpretation of such information, particularly in archeological
contexts, Dering is reluctant to I ink all recognizable change to
climatic variation.
More recently, Hulbert (1984) has suggested the presence of
climatic osci I lations recognizable 1n the evidence avai I able from
leporid (lagomorph) fauna from various parts of Central and West
Central Texas.
His reconstruction suggests three major Holocene
climatic periods in the Lower Pecos region, with conditions more mesic
than today between 9,000 and 5,000 years BP, more xeric between 5,000
and 3,000 years BP and essentially modern conditions after 3,000 BP.
Note that this latter date corresponds with that proposed by Bryant
(1977) for the establishment of modern vegetation communities 1n
Central Texas.
To what extent these fluctuations may have affected culture is
stil I a matter for speculation.
Gunn and Prewitt (1984) have
reassessed Prewitt's (1981) Central Texas archeological sequence in
the I ight of the most recently available paleoclimatological data,
finding several correlations between culture change and climatic
variation. They described the Central Texas region as a broad ecotone
where climatic instabi I ity may have brought about periodic shifts 1n
adaptive strategies.
Responses to climatic change appear to have
included shifting cultural ranges and occasional tethering to the more
secure moisture of the Balcones Escarpment.
While changing climates during the Holocene may have radically
altered some of the environmental parameters of the Aqui I la Lake area,
the bedrock geology has remained essentially unaltered.
The great
difference in this particular feature of the environment has been the
evolution of the Aqui I la Creek drainage basin throughout the Holocene,
with some areas undergoing extensive erosion and alluvial downcutting
and the extensive, cyclical changes occurring on the major stream
floodplains through time.
Outside of some erosion in upland areas,
change has been most marked in the riverine environments.
Thus, while the resources avai I able within the major biotic zones
(which are in turn defined by major geologic bedrock zones) may have
changed through time, it is possible that each zone was altered
directionally, retaining the distinctions between the three basic
zones. Resources avai I able to the aboriginal occupants would have
varied within each zone.
Crosscutting these geo-biotic zones are
resource zones which also must be considered. Perhaps most important
of these is the riverine microhabitat found in al I three biotic zones,
though perhaps changing with time as the creeks meandered back and
forth across the floodplains.
Adjacent to these, in the uplands
across most of the project area, are the ancient terrace gravels of

2-14

ENVIRONMENT
the Uvalde Formation (see Byrd 1971 for a description of the or1g1n,
composition and distribution of these deposits) that apparently
provided
the
most important I ithic source for the aboriginal
inhabitants.
Soi Is, which change slowly, are an important indicator of the
prehistoric biotic environment in cases where modern agricultural
practices have totally destroyed the original flora and fauna.
Although there is no evidence for aboriginal agricultural activities
within the Aqui I la Lake area, the distribution of various suitable
soi I types might suggest places to look for evidence of such activity.
McCormick (1973) has discussed the use of economic plants by
various Plains and Southeastern Indian groups in an attempt to define
potentially important places for the Caddoan groups of east Texas.
The vast majority of the plants discussed are native to the bottomland
forests. The ethnohistoric use of plants should be taken only to
indicate the kinds and variety of plants exploited by native peoples
in similar environments and at similar levels of socioeconomic
organization, not as a suggestion that they were used by the
prehistoric inhabitants of Aqui I la Creek or the Central Brazos area.
The most significant aspect of the upland environment, from a
subsistence perspective, is the fauna it supports.
Lynott (1977:30)
has described the uplands as 11 â¢â¢ a sea of inedible grasses", an
assessment which may be slightly overstated, but 1s to some degree
correct.
The lowland forests probably supplied most of the economic plants
used by the prehistoric peoples of the Aquil la area. These forests
probably consisted of:
Oak, elm, hackberry, cottonwood, ash, black wi I low, pecan,
and
other
larger

plant community
1s dominated by various
combinations of beaked panicum, switchgrass, Indiangrass,
big and I ittle bluestem, eastern grama, vine mesquite, and
Florida papal um (USDA 1972:1).
In addition to providing native food plants, the floodplain
environment may
have also supported I imited horticulture.
Historic groups (Wichita, Anadarko) are known to have practiced
cultivation in the Central Brazos floodplain, and Jelks (1962)
has recovered a corn cob from a Late Prehistoric context at the
Kyle Site, only 22.5 kilometers from the confluence of Hackberry
and Aqui I la creeks. A single cob is not definitive evidence of

2-15

ENVIRONMENT
horticulture but the possibi I ity must be considered. No evidence
of agricultural products is reported by Stephenson (1970) from
historic sites (Stansbury, Fort Graham), where horticulture is
known to have been practiced, suggesting that the absence of
cultigens may be an accident of preservation or a bias 1n
archeological recovery techniques.
All available evidence suggests that the modern fauna of the
Central Brazos region is not essentially different from the
aboriginally avai Iable resources. The most important prehistoric
resources now absent from the region are bison and antelope,
remains of which were recovered from both the Kyle Site (Jelks
1962) and the McDonald Site (this report). Although both of
these animals can be regarded as highly ranked prehistoric
resources, it is not clear whether either was ever present in
large numbers in the Central Brazos region.
Of al I the changes suggested above, the most dramatic is the
alteration of the floral environment during the Historic Period.
This change has been radical, even making the identification of
the original communities difficult and causing a concomitant
alteration of the faunal resources present. Some reconstruction
can be and has been attempted on the basis of relict communities,
but many of the finer detai Is of the prehistoric environment may
never be known. Although the general nature of the environment
can often be I inked to specific soi Is or geomorphic features,
ful I
investigation
of archeological sites necessitates an
examination of the surrounding microhabitat as shown in the
archeological record itself (i.e., pollen, biosi lica and organic
residues). Large scale reconstruction wi I I only be possible
after
the accumulation of a sufficiently large sample of
microhabitats from any area during a given period of time.

GEOMORPHOLOGY

INTRODUCTION
A reconnaissance geomorphic study of the Aqui I la Creek drainage
basin
was made to map the f luvial terraces within the basin
(Fig. 3.1). The study was initiated to determine the ages of the
terraces and their archeological potential. Field investigations were
conducted throughout the drainage basin upstream from the confluence
with Hackberry Creek. Field work consisted of examining excavations
on several terrace levels, soi I stratigraphic studies of natural
outcrops and measurements of representative channel cross-sections on
Hackberry and Aqui I la creeks. The terraces were mapped from aerial
photographs onto a 1:24,000 topographic base provided by the U.S.
Geological Survey 7.5 minute Peoria Topographic Quadrangle.
Aqui I la Creek and its major tributary, Hackberry Creek, head in
the eastern edge of the Great Plains physiographic province of Texas
(Fenneman 1931). The streams flow south to their confluence near
Vaughan, Texas.
Aqui I la Creek flows into the Brazos River upstream
from Waco. The drainage basin is northwest of the zone of normal
faulting that marks the Balcones Escarpment (Barnes 1970). The
streams in the basin are incised into gently dipping Upper Cretaceous
sandstone, shales and limestones. Uni ike similarly sized streams to
the southwest, Aqui I la Creek has a southerly trend, essentially
fol lowing a strike valley excavated in the Woodbine Formation. This
is particularly apparent along the lower 8 kilometers of Hackberry
Creek and south along Aquil la Creek where the drainage incision into
the Woodbine Formation has accentuated the low relief cuesta capped by
the overlying Upper Cretaceous Lake Waco Formation of the Eagle Ford
Group (Barnes 1970). Exposures of the contact between the Woodbine
and Lake Waco formations can be traced along the length of southern
Hackberry Creek.

GEOMORPHOLOGY

FLUVIAL TERRACES
Emphasis in this investigation was given to the mapping and
stratigraphic interpretation of the terraces within the upper Aqui I la
drainage basin. These surfaces are the most extensive geomorphic
landforms within the basin and are probably the most significant
features related to the archeological potential of the study area.
Terraces are identified and mapped based on their elevation above the
modern
streams,
lateral
continuity,
degree
of
dissection,
sedimentology and soi I stratigraphy. Three distinct terrace levels
were identified in the field.
Aerial photograph interpretation
indicated that several terrace remnants correlated in the field may be
terraces of slightly differing age.
This conf I ict could not be
resolved without more detailed soi I stratigraphic work. But, these
age differences are probably minor relative to the age differences
between major terrace groups.
Description of the Terraces
TERRACE LEVEL 3
Along the eastern boundary of the basin are thin gravel deposits
that mantle the surface of fields and cap the weathering profile
developed on the underlying Lake Waco Formation.
The gravels are
comprised of resistant quartzite and chert cobbles. The resistant
nature of this residual lag gravel is evidence of extensive weathering
that has removed its less resistant components.
The elevation of the surface capped by these gravels 1s about 185
meters (607 feet) MSL. The terrace surface is about 35 meters above
the modern streams. The highest surface between the two creeks,
drained by Rocky Branch in the vicinity of the Triplett Ranch
Airfield, is capped by similar gravel deposits and is probably
correlative.
A similar surface exists on the western margin of the
basin.
Based on the quartzite and chert composition of this
and the high elevation above the modern streams, these
been identified as Uvalde gravels (Ritchie and Slaughter

Along the margins of this surface, extensive erosion by smal I,
high gradient streams has modified the terrace scarp. These streams
have formed smal I alluvial fans which are graded either to the major
streams or the adjacent lower terrace. The sedimentation on these fan
3-3

GEOMORPHOLOGY
surfaces indicates periodic reworking of older stable surfaces by
Â·gullying.
It is likely that the erosion process on these fans is
episodic, controlled both by the sediment yields from the Uvalde
surface
and the periodic occurrence of large rainfal I events.
Research on small alluvial fans has suggested that the erosion and
sedimentation processes are strongly control led by internal geomorphic
processes related to sediment production within the basin (Schumm
1977).
Therefore, these fans probably have a complex depositional
history and adjacent fans
would
probably
not
have similar
stratigraphies.
The ri I Is and fans were likely initiated with the
incision of the modern drainage of Aqui I la Creek and therefore their
development spans the entire period of the evolution of the drainage
basin.

TERRACE LEVEL 2
A second terrace level occurs at an elevation of 7 to 12 meters
(23 - 39 ft) above the modern stream level. The terrace is continuous
along the western side of Hackberry Creek and along the eastern side
of Aqui I la Creek. Isolated remnants of this terrace are present along
the western margin of Aquil la Creek. These remnants are difficult to
map because of their smal I area and because they are dissected by
smal I drainages. This terrace level may represent several closely
spaced terraces.
In general, this terrace level is less dissected
than the terrace 3 level, but more eroded and degraded than the
younger terrace 1 level.
A distinctive soi I stratigraphy has developed on the sandy
alluvium that comprises the alluvial fil I of this terrace on Aqui I la
Creek. Figure 3.2 shows soi I profiles measured in excavations at
sites 41HI76 and 41HI77 on this terrace level. The soi Is have a 15
centimeter thick plow zone that has destroyed the original A horizon.
This zone is light gray in color, reflecting the low organic content
of the soi I. Underlying the plow zone is an unweathered horizon of
variable thickness. This surface soi I caps a buried oxidized argi I I ic
B horizon that is 30 to 60 centimeters thick.
The parent material
underlying the B horizon at site 41HI76 ranges in texture from granule
gravel to silty sand. The thickness of the surface soi I varies with
topography,

in a downslope direction.
This poorly

of the alluvium deposited on this level.
It is
conceivable that most of this deposit has accumulated in historic
times.
This is suggested by the height of the hedgerows in relation
to the adjacent field which indicates that there has been considerable
post-settlement erosion and reworking of the sediment on this terrace.

3-4

GEOMORPHOLOGY
At one terrace remnant near site 41HI77, the Woodbine Formation
crops out a few meters below terrace level. While this may reflect
only the thickness of the alluvium near margins of the valley, it
does, however, suggest that this alluvial fi I I is not thick.
TERRACE LEVEL 1
The lowermost terrace along Aqui I la Creek and Hackberry Creek
merges with the active floodplain. This terrace is the most extensive
and laterally continuous terrace in the basin and is the most easily
mapped surface.
As would be expected, it is the terrace level least
modified by erosion although it has been altered by deposition along
its margins.
Two stratigraphic exposures in this terrace i I lustrate
the
sedimentology,
soi I
stratigraphy
and
post-depositional
modification.
A tributary gully to Hackberry Creek, opposite the McDonald Site,
has created an excel lent exposure of this terrace (Fig. 3.3). The
terrace alluvium is a black carbonate-mottled clayey silt derived from
the Eagle Ford Group.
On top of the terrace alluvium is an 88
centimeter thick layer of coarse grained col luvium derived from the
terrace 2 level.
The col luvium lacks soi I development except for a
recognizable, organic-rich Ap horizon
plow zone.
This soi I is
essentially the same as the surface soi I on the terrace 2 level in
terms of degree of development. Beneath the col luvium a buried soi I
is present, developed on the terrace alluvium. The soil has a 50
centimeter thick, organic-rich black A horizon overlying a
54
centimeter thick oxidized argi I lie B horizon. The entire exposure of
the C horizon is oxidized. The alluvium in this exposure is 2 to 3
meters thick, based on outcrops of the Woodbine Formation in the floor
of the gully.
At the confluence of Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks, a similar
buried soi I is present in the construction borrow pits cut into this
terrace level. In the borrow pit exposures this soi I is buried by
overbank sediment from the modern streams. Therefore, this terrace
surface is modified by overbank sediment near the modern creeks and by
col luvial deposition near its contact with the adjacent higher
terrace.
The alluvium compr1s1ng this terrace is clearly derived from the
Cretaceous shales. This silty alluvium is distinct from the alluvium
in the terrace 2 level along Aqui I la Creek, which is dominantly
sand-sized.
The abrupt change in the textural characteristics of
these terraces along upper Aqui I la Creek suggests that since the
formation of the Terrace 2 level a larger portion of the Aqui I la Creek
basin has extended onto the calcareous shales.
This hypothesis is
supported by the geologic map of the basin (Barnes 1972). Aqui I la

Creek, above the confluence with Hackberry Creek, has its main stem
entirely within the Woodbine sandstone. While the greatest percentage
of the basin sti I I I ies within the outcrop area of the Woodbine
Formation, several tributaries now drain Cretaceous shales. Little
Aqui I la Creek, a western tributary of Aqui I la Creek, has eroded
through the Woodbine Formation into the underlying Grayson Formation,
a calcareous siltstone. Numerous smal I eastern tributaries, such as
Cottonwood Creek, are headwardly extending into the overlying Eagle
Ford Group. The time interval between the formation of terraces 2 and
3 probably marks a period of significant drainage extension.
FLOODPLAIN LEVEL
The modern floodplain of Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks merges
almost imperceptibly with the lowest terrace. The floodplain is,
however, a zone of rapid sedimentation along the creeks. Evidence of
rapid sedimentation is the lack of soi I development on floodplain
deposits and the numerous buried trees on this surface.
Exposures cut into the floodplain at the
McDonald Site
(Fig. 3.4), indicate that the upper 45 centimeters of the exposed
trench are lighter in color and coarser grained than the underlying
sediment.
A possible explanation for this textural break is a rapid
increase in sediment loads, with agricultural land clearing causing
accelerated deposition on the floodplains. Numerous instances of this
phenomena have been observed throughout the United States (Knox 1972;
Costa 1975).
The main channels of Hackberry and Aquil la creeks are deep and
narrow, with low width-depth ratios typical of streams that transport
dominantly suspended load. Channel cross-sections were surveyed to
estimate the magnitude of bankful I discharge using the slope-area
method (Figs. 3.5, 3.6).
These estimates were compared with the
runoff records for Aqui I la Creek near Aqui I la, adjusted for drainage
area, to estimate the frequency of bankfull discharge on these stream
reaches.
A standard log Pearson III analysis was made of the Aqui I la
discharge data to determine runoff probabilities (Beard 1962). Figure
3.7 is the log Pearson distribution for the gaging station plotted on
probabi I ity paper.
Estimated bankful I discharge on Aqui I la Creek, drainage area 404
square kilometers, is 82 cubic meters per second and on Hackberry
Creek, drainage area 323 square kilometers, is 102 cubic meters per
second.
Based on these estimates, bankful I discharge would have a
probability of about .2 to .4 or a return period of 5 to 2.5 years.
These data confirm the stratigraphic evidence that flooding of the
lowest terrace level 1s common.

Terrace Ages and Potential for Buried Archeological Sites
Information on the ages of the terraces mapped would be valuable
in predicting which terrace levels would have the greatest potential
for buried
stratified
sites.
Although
precise quantitative
information on the terrace levels is not avai I able, it is possible to
speculate on their ages based on the soi I stratigraphy and the
erosional modification of the terraces.
First, it is apparent, based on the high degree of weathering and
the presumed Pl io-Pleistocene age of the Uvalde gravel (terrace 3),
that only surficial archeological remains wi I I exist.
The hi llslope
alluvial fan systems which drain this terrace level have probably been
active since the incision of the Uvalde surface. These alluvial fans
have the potential for buried archeological material. However, most
material preserved in these deposits wi I I have been transported.
Equally important, given the episodic erosion and deposition cycle
which dominates the hi I lslope system, it is likely that most material
wi I I have been reworked. Therefore, the potential for finding in situ
archeological sites separated by clear stratigraphic boundaries~would
appear to be slight.
The terrace 2 level is probably early Pleistocene in age.
This
assumption is based on the wel I developed buried soi I present on top
of the alluvium and the degree of dissection of the terrace remnants.
Furthermore, the gross textural characteristics of the alluvium
indicate that the terrace dates from a time period when the upper
Aqui I la drainage was less extensive. Buried archeological material
has been found on this surface (sites 41Hl76, 41Hl77, Skinner et
al. 1978).
At site 41Hl76 al I of the artifacts were recovered from
the horizons above the buried B horizon. At site 41Hl77 only about 3~
of the artifacts were found below this buried horizon. Based on this
information and the geomorphic evidence, it is obvious that the
formation of the terrace 2 level and the period of soi I formation in
which artifacts are found lacks soi I development and is therefore
relatively young.
Cultural material that occurs in this horizon has
been incorporated into the subsurface through agricultural practices
and through slope wash and aeolian action. It is unlikely that a wel I
stratified site wi I I be found in this alluvium.
Rather, the zone
above the B horizon, which may be up to two meters thick, should have
a mix of cultural debris reflecting the reworking of surface deposits.
The terrace 1 level is the youngest of the three terraces mapped
1n the basin.
Again, no precise age of this terrace is known. The
terrace, based on its position in the valley and the degree of soi I
development present on the alluvium, may be correlative with the
Deweyvi I le Terrace of the Gulf Coastal Plain (Saucier and Fleetwood
3-12

GEOMORPHOLOGY
1970).
The Deweyvi I le Terrace occupies a position in river valleys
between the Holocene floodplain and an older pre-Wisconsin terrace,
the position of the terrace 1 level in the Aqui I la basin. A
difficulty with this correlation 1s that while terraces on large
rivers reflect base level and climatic changes, terraces in smaller
basins may be the result of internal geomorphic processes (Schumm and
Parker 1973;
Schumm 1977). Therefore, terraces within the Aquil la
basin need not be correlative with regional terrace sequences.
If the terrace 1 level is correlative with the Deweyville
Terrace, it would have formed during an aggradational phase in the
late Wisconsin (Saucier and Fleetwood 1970). The Holocene floodplain
essentially
represents a continuation of this aggrading phase.
Radiocarbon ages on the Deweyvi I le Terrace range from 13,000 to 30,000
years BP (Saucier and Fleetwood 1970). Based on the degree of soil
development on the terrace 1 level and correlation with the terrace
chronology developed for the Colorado River of Texas (Baker and
Penteado-Orel lana 1977), the older age is probably the best estimate.
A sample of the buried, organic-rich A horizon present on this terrace
was collected for radiocarbon dating.
This soi I is an important
stratigraphic marker. Determining a limiting age for the time of soi I
formation would aid in better defining the archeological potential of
the alluvial fi II.
If the late Wisconsin age of about 30,000 years
BP is correct, the archeological potential for this terrace would be
I imited.
The upper surface of the terrace 1
level
has
definite
archeological potential. The terrace surface is buried with col luvium
along its scarp with higher terraces and with overbank sediment where
it merges with the modern floodplain. Site 41HI58 (x41HI40 - Skinner
et al. 1978) appears to be an example of the latter situation.
Archeological
material
spanning the
time interval since the
entrenchment of the terrace in the late Wisconsin and Holocene would
be preserved above the buried soi I horizon.
The greatest potential for stratified archeological sites is
within the modern floodplain deposits. These deposits are younger
than the sediment comprising terrace 1 and are Holocene in age.
This
age estimate is based on the lack of soi I development on these
deposits and the evidence of continuing deposition on this surface.
Evidence of deeply buried stratified sites has been recorded by
previous workers (Skinner et
al. 1978).
Therefore,
overbank
sedimentation
was coincident with occupation of the floodplain
throughout the Holocene. This should result in vertical separation of
any cultural material found in the floodplain deposits. Surface finds
should be negligible because of the rapid influx of sediment that
buried the floodplains fol lowing historical settlement and land
clearing.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH IN THE CENTRAL BRAZOS

without a sol id culture-historical framework to define the spatial and
temporal I imits of variabi I ity.
The ideas and approaches to Texas prehistory have been refined
through the years as thousands of sites have been discovered and
hundreds of excavations carried out. Suhm (1960) has detailed the
development of the early understanding of the Central Texas area.
From the early
attempts
at
culture-historical
syntheses
by
archeological
pioneers
such
as J.E. Pearce, Cyrus N. Ray and
E.B. Sayles;
the McKern taxonomic system based cultural
model
proposed by J. Charles Kelley (1947a, 1947b) emerged as a stable base
for future work. This model, which at its simplest level is divided
into an early Edwards Plateau Aspect (corresponding to the modern
Archaic) and a later Central Texas Aspect (now generally termed the
Late Prehistoric), is sti I I the basic framework for most modern
attempts at defining culture chronology in the Central Texas region.
Kel ley>s Edwards Plateau Aspect was divided into three foci, Clear
Fork, Round Rock and Uvalde, while the Central Texas Aspect was
divided into two foci, Austin and Toyah (Suhm 1960).
The Central Brazos region was an important focus of research
during this developmental period. Much of this early work, primarily
concerned with unique sites and artifact types, was conducted by
avocational archeologists.
This work and the substantial later
contributions made by avocationals have been extremely important in
understanding the prehistory of the region. Particularly in more
recent times, the avocational archeologist, working in areas outside
of reservoirs and other artificially circumscribed areas to which

Probably the earliest archeological surveys of this area were
those of Frank Bryan (1930, 1931, 1937) who, as a geologist, located
many sites while conducting his field work.
He reported sites in
Hill, Navarro, Limestone and Mclennan counties, including six sites in
the Aqui I la Reservoir area, of which three (41HI74/114, 41HI76 and
41HI77) have been investigated by the TAS and are reported in this
volume. A fourth, 41HI75, was studied by SMU and reported by Skinner
et al.
(1978:90-93, ms. :41-53, this report).

variety of projectile point forms that were later defined as formal
types, and was keenly aware of the variation in their distribution.
Members of the Central Texas Archeological Society (CTAS) in Waco
excavated what appeared to be a mass burial in 1936 after its
discovery during the construction of the Waco sewage treatment plant.
These excavations were reported by several authors in the pub I ication
of the CTAS (Lux 1937; Meroney 1936; Turner 1937; Watt and Meroney
1937a).
The first work in that portion of the Central Brazos later to be
included in the Whitney Reservoir was reported by Watt and Meroney
(1937b), who presented an analysis of historic glass trade beads
recovered from the Stansbury Site, subsequently investigated by
Stephenson (1947, 1970). Frank Watt (1938) of the CTAS then turned
his attention to the enigmatic notched stones, which he cal led "Waco
Sinkers," so common on Archaic sites throughout the Central Brazos.
His discussion sti I I stands as the most comprehensive treatment of
these unusual and unexplained artifacts. Later, Watt (1941) presented
the first pub I ished discussion of East Texas ceramics found in this
area.
The WPA archeological work of the 1930s, which gathered a large
body of wel I documented (albeit generally unpublished) data on many
areas 1n Texas, left the Central Brazos region virtually untouched.
It was not until the advent of the River Basin Surveys program in
Texas in the 1940s that the region was opened to professional
archeologists. As might be expected, the emphasis shifted from unique
sites and artifacts to the elicitation of a culture-historical
sequence.
During the late 1940s, Robert Stephenson (1947 1 1970) conducted
an extensive survey and testing program for the Smithsonian River
Basin Surveys at Lake Whitney, 40 kilometers up the Brazos River from
Waco.
This survey located 61 archeological sites, two historic sites
and two paleontological localities.
No evidence of Paleoindian

4-2

PREVIOUS RESEARCH
occupation was discovered.
Test excavations were conducted at 23
sites and more extensive excavations at five sites.
Stephenson's report on the major excavations and a discussion of
the Lake Whitney project were not published until 1970. The five
sites receiving the most intensive work were the Stansbury Site, a
historic Wichita, Caddo and Tonkawa settlement; the Steele Site, an
open stratified site; and three rockshelters (Pictograph, Buzzard and
Sheep shelters) containing stratified deposits of Central Texas Aspect
(Late Prehistoric) materials. Of the major sites, only the Steele
Site contained a significant Archaic component.
Major excavations at Blum Rockshelter by Edward Jelks (1953) were
also conducted in conjunction with the archeological salvage program
at Lake Whitney. The materials from this site, together with those
recovered later from the Kyle Site, formed the basis for Jelks' (1962)
redefinition of the Austin and Toyah foci of the Central Texas Aspect.
Regional synthesis continued to be important during this period.
In 1952, Crook and Harris pub I ished their description of the Trinity
Aspect in North Central Texas, dividing the Archaic Period into the
early Carrolton and later Elam foci. Later, Suhm, Krieger and Jelks
(1954) presented their monumental summary of Texas prehistory.
This
latter work hedged in stating the focus definitions for the Edwards
Plateau and Central Texas aspects, preferring to work within the more
easily defined broad temporal units.
The Ham Creek Site, located on the north side of the Brazos River
at the upper end of Lake Whitney, was excavated by the Tarrant County
Archeological Society in 1956 (Forrester 1964). This site is unique
1n that it is the northernmost known burned rock midden, a site form
common to the Edwards Plateau but rare north of the Brazos River. The
excavated materials indicated a multicomponent Archaic occupation.
Excavations at three smal I rockshelters in western Hi II County
were
conducted by the Tarrant County and Dal las Archeological
societies in 1957-58 (Long 1961). The recovered materials (including
Caddoan style ceramics, suggesting contact with East Texas groups),
while lacking stratigraphic distinctions, are in substantial agreement
with those recovered from Blum and Kyle shelters (Jelks 1962).
The Kyle Site, one of the most important sites yet reported from
the Central Brazos, was excavated in 1959 and 1960 by the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project and the Dal las Archeological Society
(Jelks 1962).
Jelks supervised most of the field work, analyzed the
material and wrote the final report.
By this time, sufficient
evidence had been accumulated from this and other sites, Blum
Rockshelter (Jelks 1953) and the Smith Rockshelter near Austin (Suhm

1957), to al low the detailed definition of two Late Prehistoric foci,
Austin and Toyah, and to clarify their temporal positions.
A single
corncob recovered from the Kyle Site constitutes the only direct
evidence of cultigens in
the
Central
Brazos
region
(Jelks
1962:113-115).
Refining the established chronologies continued to
be an
important
pursuit during
this period, perhaps spurred on by
extra-regional syntheses, such as Wi I ley and Phi I lips (1958) opus on
American archeology.
Suhm 1 s (1960) review article appeared at this
time, summar1z1ng previous theoretical positions and
the more
important early work, and suggesting future directions. Close after
this came Jelks, (1962) redefinition of the Central Texas Aspect from
his Kyle Site work and the sti I I much utilized Handbook of Texas
Archeology (Suhm and Jelks 1962) that successfully placed a number of
basic artifact styles in their regional and temporal context. At this
same time, Johnson (1962) defined the La Harpe Aspect of the Archaic
stage of East Texas on the basis of his excavations at the Yarbrough
and Mi Iler sites.
During the 1960s, the Edwards Plateau Aspect came to be known
simply as the Archaic Period and a number of important studies,
focused primarily in South and West Central Texas (see Johnson, Suhm
and Tunnel I 1962;
Johnson 1967), began once again to attempt
subdivisions of this long period. Closer to the study area, Sorrow,
Shafer
and Ross (1967) defined a series of Archaic and Late
Prehistoric occupational phases based on their excavations at the Evoe
Terrace and Lands I ide sites in the Sti I I house Hollow Reservoir,
southeast of Belton.
One of the more important reservoir projects 1n the Central
Brazos region during the 1960s was the Texas Archeological Salvage
Project (now TAS) excavations at the Baylor and Britton sites in the
Waco Reservoir, Mclennan County, carried out by Dee Ann Story and
Harry Shafer in 1964 (Story and Shafer 1965). The Baylor Site had a
series
of
deeply stratified deposits that contained materials
diagnostic of Paleoindian, Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations,
while the Britton Site had a wel I defined Late Archaic component.
Frank Watt 1 s work during the middle to late 1960s included the
reporting of excavations at the Clark Site, excavated in 1955 (Watt
1965), and of investigations at the Lookout Point Site, an Archaic
site on the upland edge above Lake Waco. In addition, work with
Albert Redder at the Ballew and Francis sites and Horn shelters
provided
important evidence for the age and intensity of the
Paleoindian occupation of the Central Brazos (Watt and Agogino 1968;
Watt 1978).

PREVIOUS RESEARCH
Another Central Brazos region Paleoindian site is the Acton Site
at Lake Granbury, reported by Blaine et al. (1968). Unfortunately,
as in the case of the Ballew and Francis sites, this site was found to
be seriously def lated. While such post-depositional disturbances may
have destroyed or greatly modified the primary spatial associations of
the artifacts and features, the analysis of the artifact assemblage
can stil I provide important evidence of technology and site function.
Plans to raise the pool level of Lake Whitney in the early 1970s
necessitated a resurvey of the lake margins which was conducted by
S. Alan Skinner and R. King Harris (1971) of the SMU Archaeology
Research Program (SMU). A total of 34 sites, including historic Fort
Graham, was recorded.
In the summer of 1972, The University of Texas at Austin
conducted its archeological field school under the direction of Dee
Ann Story at the Chupik Site near the mouth of Aqui I la Creek.
The
site, first noted by Watt (1941, 1953) as having Caddoan style
ceramics, continued to yield ceramics but few intact features.
This
research has not yet been reported.
Skinner and Gallagher (1974) reported on
additional
work
conducted at Lake Whitney during 1971-72, describing 47 sites. Two
sites, Bowling Pin and Indian Springs, were intensively investigated,
yielding Archaic and Late Prehistoric materials respectively.
In the mid-1970s, SMU conducted an archeological survey of the
Hog Creek Floodwater Retarding Structure located southwest of Cliffton
in Coryel I and Bosque counties (Larson et al. 1975). Ten sites were
located within the direct impact area and nine others in adjacent
areas. SMU returned to test two Coryel I County rockshelters, the L.E.
Robertson Shelter and the Stone Rockshelter, both Late Prehistoric
sites (Larson and Kirby 1976).
In 1976, Mal louf and Baskin (1976) conducted a survey of the
Tehuacana Creek drainage in Mclennan and Hi I I counties for the Texas
Historical Commission. This survey located 17 archeological sites and
24 minor scatters. The Brookeen cache, initially recorded during this
survey, is located less than 15 kilometers southeast of the Aqui I la
Lake area.
The effects of plow disturbance and displacement on this
cache of Edwards Plateau chert have been studied in detai I by Mal louf
(1981).
For the last several years, the SMU archeology program has been
in testing and mitigation in the Richland-Chambers creek area near
Limestone counties.

Working just south and east of the Richland-Chambers project, a
master's thesis by M.J. McReynolds (1984) of UT-Austin may also shed
light on artifact distributions and settlement patterns in this as yet
poorly known area.
INVESTIGATIONS AT AQUILLA LAKE
Other than the early survey by Bryan described above and the
inclusion
of
Aqui I la
Creek sites 1n discussions of artifact
occurrences throughout the
region
(see
Watt
1941),
little
archeological work was conducted in the immediate study area unti I the
initiation of the cultural resources management program in conjunction
with the planned construction of Aqui I la Lake. Prior to the SMU
survey, only two archeological sites in the Aqui I la Lake area (41HI57
the Kupec Site and 41HI58 - the Reps Davis Site), both south of the
dam, had been recorded in the site files at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL).
The initial archeological survey of the Aqui I la Lake project area
was conducted by SMU in the summer of 1972 under the direction of
S. Alan Skinner (Skinner and Henderson 1972). During that time, 125
prehistoric sites were located within the present lake area as wel I as
in the area of several alternate dam sites. No historic sites were

from the project area since the alternate damsite farthest upstream
was chosen as the project location.
The environmental resources
document compiled by SMU (Skinner et al. 1972), prepared at the level
of a planning document with archeological survey at the pre I iminary
reconnaissance level, recommended that this damsite might have the
least environmental impact but would also provide the smallest long
term water supply.
In the archeological survey report (Skinner and Henderson 1972),
sites are listed in table form with a brief verbal description of
each. Sites are grouped according to a number of previously defined
physiographic categories.
Artifactual materials from the sites are
grouped into broad morphological-functional categories (projectile
points, bi faces, etc.) and artifact tables are compiled for each
physiographic area.
Skinner and Henderson's concluding
observations
note
the
generally smal I size of sites along Aqui I la Creek. They suggest that
these are smal I temporary camps of people who had larger and more
permanent base camps elsewhere, perhaps on the Brazos. As they put

A second season of survey was conducted 1n 1975 in conjunction
with the first phase of site testing (Lynott and Peter 1977). By that
time, the damsite had been finalized at its present location and a
systematic survey of the reservoir area was scheduled. Lynott and
Peter (1977:31) state:
Surveying essentially was planned to relocate sites recorded
in 1972 and to search areas that were not covered in 1972.
This resulted in the increase of the number of known sites
within the proposed Aqui I la Reservoir to ninety-six ...
Only 68 of the previously recorded sites were relocated.
Examination
of the map of the survey area indicates that six new SMU trinomial
site numbers were assigned at this time.
The first season of archeological site testing was undertaken in
1975 by Lynott and Peter (1977) in conjunction with the comprehensive
site survey described above. They tested 23 sites utilizing various
combinations of test pits, posthole testing and control led surface
collection to determine the archeological potential of the various
sites.
Based on their work, they recommended mitigation or further
work at 19 archeological sites. Their culturally related conclusions
support those offered in 1972:
1975
The general picture which emerges from the
investigations
at
Aqui I la Lake is one of short-term
occupations, hypothetically occurring primarily in the fal I
and winter. Most of the sites are foraging stations of some
kind. No significant patterning is visible 1n terms of
ecological
or geomorphologic distribution of sites at
Aqui I la Lake, but al I stages of the prehistoric period are
represented.
The 1975 investigations support the general
interpretations made from the 1972 survey about the nature
of sites in the upper Aqui I la drai~age. (Lynott and Peter
1977:136)
Further work, including surface collection, extensive testing and
excavation, was recommended for 14 archeological sites in the project
area. Mitigation, primarily in the form of surface collection but
including excavations at two sites, was suggested for an additional
five sites.
In 1977, SMU returned to Aqui I la Lake for another season of
testing (Skinner et al.
1978).
Eight sites were tested using a
variety of methods including surface collection, post hole testing and

control led excavations. Several specialized appendices (on mol lusca,
pedology and skeletal remains from the Kupec Site) and sections on the
use of amateur collections and a site catchment analysis, are valuable
features of the report of this season's work. This report presents a
detailed
synthesis
of the Aqui I la Lake prehistory, suggesting
alternate models to account for cultural change in the area.
These
models are discussed in the concluding chapter of the report.

SMU undertook a final season of investigation at Aquil la Lake,
testing and excavating eight sites in 1978. This work, reported
previously in draft form (Skinner et al. 1978), is included here 1n
chapters authored by Duane Peter.

CHAPTER 5
REGIONAL PREHISTORY

Richard P. Watson and David 0. Brown

INTRODUCTION
Research undertaken in Central and North Central Texas over the
past 50 years has determined that the Central Brazos River Basin was
occupied for the last 10,000 to 11,000 years.
Researchers have
proposed a variety of chronological schemes to provide a framework to
better explain the changes in the occupation, adaptation and cultural
development of this area. These schemes have been reviewed elsewhere
(Prewitt 1981;
Suhm 1960:74-85;
Weir 1976:8-15), and are not
repeated here. Rather, a brief summary and discussion of the general
chronological scheme most often applied to this region wi I I be
presented, and where appropriate, its articulation with the schemes of
Prewitt (1981) and Weir (1976). The Central Texas culture area, as
defined by Prewitt (1981) is shown in Figure 5.1.
The prehistory of the Central Brazos can be divided into the
three stages proposed by Suhm, Krieger and Jelks (1954:16-21) for
Central Texas:
Paleo-American, Archaic and Neo-American.
More
recently, Paleoindian has been substituted for the term Paleo-American
and the term Late Prehistoric has come into use in place of
Neo-American.
The later two stages have been further subdivided into
a series of phases, initially termed foci (Fig. 5.2).
The Archaic
Stage is most often divided into the Early, Middle and Late periods
(Lynott 1977; Lynott and Peter 1977; Skinner 1981; Skinner et al.
1978), although Forrester (1964) included the Transitional Period
proposed for
Central
Texas
by
Johnson,
Suhm
and
Tunnel I
(1962:117-124).
The Late Prehistoric is divided into two phases,
Austin and Toyah (Jelks 1962:84-99).
These subdivisions have been
defined primarily on the basis of changes in projectile point
morphology. However, in the case of the Late Prehistoric, they
include the presence or absence of ceramics and a variety of tool
types (Jelks 1962:84-99).

Weir 1 s (1976) subdivision of the Archaic into five phases is,
I ike the others, based primarily on changes in projectile point

proposed a further subdivision of the Archaic based on the basis of
the evolutionary culture-historical developmental concept of Willey
and Phi I lips (1958). He proposed eleven phases for the Archaic in
Central Texas.
While acknowledging acceptance of Cook's (1976)
5-2

REGIONAL PREHISTORY
concept of cultural dimensions as integral aspects of the definition
of phases, Prewitt ultimately defines his Archaic phases on the basis
of "key index markers" and trait I ists.
Cook's use of cultural
dimensions in phase definition is a useful attempt to produce readily
comparable units of analysis (phases) composed of identifiable tasks
and activities, which may or may not be reducible to the traits used
in the definition of Prewitt's Archaic Stage phases.

Jelks (1954), also incorporates the terminological changes
discussed above.

REGIONAL PREHISTORY
PALEOINDIAN STAGE
The Paleoindian Stage is most often characterized in terms of its
manifestations on the Great Plains where it included cultures oriented
toward big game procurement, usually of now-extinct megafauna, and in
which food collecting played only a minor role. Johnson (1977) has
described this stage as a migratory, systematic, big game procurement
adaptation.
Research in the Plains and surrounding areas has yielded
important data on Paleoindian hunting and butchering technology,
settlement patterns and stone tool manufacture (Frison 1978; Judge
The Paleoindian peoples are
1973; Tunnel I 1977; Wi lmsen 1970).
perhaps best known for their distinctive, wel I crafted, lanceolate
projectile points that show striking technological and morphological
similarities across the North American continent and down into South
America. These similarities have been cited as an argument for the
rapid spread throughout the Americas of the peoples who made these
points, a proposed critical factor in the extinction of the last of
the Pleistocene megafauna (Martin 1973).
That these Paleoindian peoples were hunters in many areas 1s a
demonstrable fact. Where they strayed from the range of the grassland
loving large herbivores, it is difficult to believe that they were not
forced to place a greater emphasis on smaller game and collecting
activities. Shafer (1977b:187-188), discussing North Central Texas,
has suggested that the emphasis placed on big game hunting may be as
much a function of archeological research and preservation as of
cultural reality, a view supported by the fact that most of the sites
attributed to this stage in North Central Texas are not associated
with the remains of extinct megafauna.
A number of Paleoindian sites have been reported from the Central
Brazos region. These include Horn Shelters 1 and 2, the Ballew Site,
the Acton Site and the Baylor Site.
In addition, projectile point
types associated with the Paleoindian Stage (i.e., Clovis, Folsom and
Plainview) have been recovered from the surface of sites in this area.
Radiocarbon dates from Horn Shelters 1 and 2 provide the earliest
dates so far reported for the Paleoindian occupation of the Central
Brazos (Watt 1978:129, 131). Charcoal and snai I she I Is from below a
cultural stratum containing Plainview-like projectile points produced
dates of 10,785 + 500 BP (SMU-762);
10,310 + 150 BP (Tx-1997);
10,300 + 130 BP (Tx~l998); 9980 + 370 BP (Tx-1722)i and 9500 + 200
BP (TX~1830).
These dates are associated with Watt's "Crude Scraper
Culture" which includes his Brazos Fishtai I projectile point (Watt
1978:129, 131).
The Ballew Site, also investigated by Watt, yielded more than 100
Paleoindian points (Plainview, Meserve, Angostura, Agate Basin, and
Clovis), but was interpreted to be seriously
deflated

interpretation.
It is unlikely that the artifacts, I ithic debris and
tools would be deposited under the same conditions as the fine
sediments from which they were recovered. If this interpretation is
accepted, then the artifactual materials from the Ballew Site are
probably in a better context than is suggested by Watt and Agogino.
The Acton Site, (Blaine et al. 1968), yielded point types associated
with the late Paleoindian Stage (Plainview, Golondrina, Meserve,
Angostura, San Patrice), along with points of later types.
Several sites in the Aqui I la area contain evidence of Paleoindian
occupation, but have received only preliminary testing and surface
co I I ect ion. Sites where points diagnostic of the Paleoindian Stage
have been collected or observed are the Sul I ivan Site (41HI117),
Braz i I Site (41HI75) and 41HI110, among others.
Central Brazos sites have yet to yield any clear evidence of a
specific
Paleoindian
adaptation to the region.
One extremely
interesting aspect of the evidence gathered to date is the presence of
Watt's
Brazos
Fishtai I
projectile points and their potential
relationship to late Paleoindian cultures adapted to the southeastern
United States.
It is possible that the Central Brazos region is the
westernmost margin of this adaptation (although isolated Brazos
Fishtai I specimens have been reported further south and west). This
suggestion wi I I be discussed further in the concluding chapters of
this report.
ARCHAIC STAGE
The Archaic Stage lasted some 6000 - 7000 years in the Central
6500-6000 B.C. to A.O. 500 (Prewitt 1981;
Texas area, from ca.
Weir 1976). Not surprisingly, many of the sites known from the
Central Brazos can be dated to this lengthy period of time. The
Archaic economy was probably based on the exploitation of wi Id plant
foods and the hunting of deer, rabbit, turkey, other smal I game and
perhaps, when avai I able, bison (Johnson, Suhm and Tunnel I 1962:116;
Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976:124, 129, 133). Prewitt's (1981) subdivision
of this stage is partially based upon what he perceives to be shifts
1n exploitation patterns during this stage.
Defining the temporal I imits of the Archaic Stage is not an easy
task.
Various authors have wrestled with the difficulties of a hard
and fast definition of the traits which are generally thought to
demarcate the Archaic, such as the presence of ground and polished
stone, and have found them wanting (see Wi I ley and Phi I lips 1958). In
Central Texas, there has been some discussion of the nature of the
5-5

REGIONAL PREHISTORY
early transitional cultures and exactly where they belong (see
Sol I berger and Hester 1972, Prewitt 1981). The trend has been to
include increasingly more of what has previously been regarded as Late
Paleoindian 1n the Early Archaic (see Prewitt 1981). Any arguments
about the precise placement of such cultures are probably less
imperative than the need to understand more about the I ifestyles
prevalent during this relatively little known period.
The Archaic is often seen as a period of regional differentiation
with the development of regionally or locally specific adaptations to
the utilization of particular resources.
As was
pointed
out
previously, the interest in various, wide ranging, adaptations of the
late Pleistocene hunters may have masked some
early
regional
differences.
The Early Archaic, particularly with the inclusion of
cultures previously regarded as late Paleoindian, remains a period of
broad ranging similarities.
Early Archaic adaptations in the Central Brazos remain relatively
known. Al I of the Paleoindian sites mentioned for this region
have contained some late Paleoindian and Early Archaic materials.
Unfortunately, the lack of undisturbed sites from this period has
al lowed I ittle emphasis on its study. Comparisons of the Aqui I la Lake
area to wider regional trends are difficult because of the lack of
stratified or wel I dated Archaic sites to the north and east.
The
only area with a strongly developed culture chronology is to the south
and west, in Central Texas.
I ittle

Weir (1976) has defined a single Early Archaic phase, the San
Geronimo, which he dates from 8000 to 4500 BP, a period roughly
equivalent to the Altithermal (see Bryant 1976a, 1976b;
Bryant and
Shafer 1977).
This period is characterized as one of overal I low
population density with smal I, mobile groups of hunter gatherers
exploiting a wide variety of resources (Weir 1976:120-124). Prewitt
(1981) has added the Late Paleoindian-1 ike Circlevi I le phase (8000
7000 BP) to the beginning of the Early Archaic and divided the
remainder of Weir 1 s San Geronimo into three phases:
San Geronimo
(7000
6000 BP), Jarrel I (6000 - 5000 BP) and Oakal la (5000 - 4600
BP).
Prewitt suggests a broadly based hunting and gathering adaptation
with emphasis on gathering during this period. In support of Weir 1 s
smal I mobile groups, Prewitt adds that "a proliferation of projectile
point
styles suggests smal I dispersed bands which roamed over
relatively large geographical areas" (Prewitt 1981:73).
During the
latter part of the Early Archaic, the Oakal la phase, this pattern
apparently shifts as

REGIONAL PREHISTORY
The Central Texas Middle Archaic has come to be essentially
synonymous in recent years with the burned rock midden. These sites,
whose function and development is sti I I somewhat of a mystery, are
~idely
distributed throughout Central Texas (Prewitt 1974b). Their
northward distribution extends to the southern edge of the Central
Brazos region and occurrences have been noted in Mclennan and Bosque
counties to the south. One somewhat anomalous example, the Ham Creek
Site, has been reported northwest of the study area in Johnson County
(Forrester 1964). Despite this claim, the site appears to have
relatively
few of the characteristic projectile points usually
associated with burned rock middens (Weir 1976, Prewitt 1981).
Weir postulates two Middle Archaic phases, Clear Fork (5000
4000 BP) and Round Rock (4200 - 2600 BP). The initial date of the
earlier period corresponds roughly to the date given for
the
development of modern grassland-oak savannah vegetation communities in
Central Texas (Weir 1976:26). Sites of this phase are larger and more
numerous than during the previous San Geronimo phase. The burned rock
midden, developed early in this phase, appears to indicate the
development of a specialized economy adapted to plant processing,
perhaps of acorns (Weir 1976).
This trend
toward
increasing
population density and perhaps larger band size culminates in the
cultural coalescence of the Round Rock phase.
Prewitt (1981) distinguishes four Middle Archaic phases:
Clear
Fork (4600
4000 BP), Marshal I Ford (4000 - 3400 BP), Round Rock
(3400 - 2600 BP) and San Marcos (2600 - 2250 BP). In the last phase,
the San Marcos, he has attempted to separate the last burned rock
midden accumulations included in Weir>s Late Archaic San Marcos phase
from the midden occupying bison hunters of the Late Archaic Uvalde
phase. Both Prewitt and Weir point out a peak in burned rock midden
activity and the domination of a single cultural tradition, marked by
a single projectile point style in Central Texas
the Pedernales,
during the Round Rock phase, perhaps around 3000 BP.
No really clear statement can be made on the Middle Archaic of
the Central Brazos.
Lacking the key site type, the burned rock
midden, it is uncertain what the specific adaptation to the region was
at this time.
Several possibi I ities exist. One is that the burned
rock middens exist and archeologists have failed to recognize them,
perhaps because they may take a different form, i.e., dispersed rather
than aggregated. Another possibi I ity is that the region was utilized
extensively by the same peoples whose refuse formed the burned rock
middens, but lacking the resource processed in these middens, they
left other site type remains. A third possibility is that the Central
Brazos was sparsely inhabited at this time. A final, and perhaps more
realistic, possibi I ity is that this region was inhabited by East or
North Central Texas peoples, or it may even have been the center of a
localized cultural adaptation.

5-7

REGIONAL PREHISTORY

The last part of the Archaic is frequently divided into two
distinct periods, the Late and Transitional Archaic (Johnson, Suhm and
Tunnel I 1962). Weir's (1976) San Marcos (2800 - 1800 BP) and Twin
Sisters (2000 - 700 BP) phases reflect this distinction. The first of
these phases is marked by the reappearance of bison in Central Texas
and the possible influence of Plains bison-hunting cultures (Weir
1976:133). The accumulation of burned rock middens apparently ceased
by the succeeding Twin Sisters phase, a period Weir characterizes as
very nonspecial ized, perhaps returning to the pattern of many smal I
mobile bands suggested for the San Geronimo phase (Weir 1976:137).
Prewitt suggests three Late Archaic phases: Uvalde (2250 - 1750
BP), Twin Sisters (1750 - 1400 BP) and Driftwood (1400 - 1250 BP).
The earliest of these, which bears some resemblance to Kelley's
(1947a) Uvalde focus, equates with the later portion of Weir's San
Marcos phase. The economy of the latter two phases is seen as "Â·. a
broadly
based exploitation heavily oriented toward gathering .. "
(Prewitt
1981:74).
Prewitt
additionally
suggests
that
the
proliferation of specialized non-projectile point tool types may
indicate an efficient system of food gathering (Prewitt 1981:74).
Unlike the earlier portion of the Archaic, there is some evidence
for Late Archaic occupations in the Central Brazos. While there is a
reasonable amount of evidence, in the form of projectile points, that
there are strong similarities to the Central Texas cultures, there is
better evidence for localized traditions, such as
1s
perhaps
represented by the Godley dart point form. Occurring as a rare type
in many areas, it seems increasingly common along the Brazos from at
least as far south as the Baylor and Britten sites in Mclennan County
to the Ham Creek Site in Johnson County. Skinner et al. (1978) point
out the apparent marked increase in population in the Aquilla area
during the Late Archaic.
Frank Bryan reported several Archaic sites in the Central Brazos
region as early as the 1930s, and since that time many more have been
located and
investigated
by
both
amateur
and
professional
archeologists, including Acton (Blaine et al. 1969); Ballew (Watt
and Agogino 1968); Bear Creek Shelter (Lynott 1978, 1980; Stephenson
1970);
Ham Creek (Forrester 1964);
Horn Shelters (Watt 1978);
Britton (Story and Shafer 1965);
Indian Springs (Skinner
and
Gallagher 1974;
Stephenson 1970);
and Steele (Stephenson 1970).
Many of the sites in the Aqui I la drainage are described in survey
reports as having an Archaic occupation (Lynott and Peter 1977;
Skinner and Henderson 1972; Skinner et al. 1978).

REGIONAL PREHISTORY
LATE PREHISTORIC STAGE
This stage is wel I represented in the Central Brazos, and a
considerable
number
of
the
sites
have
been systematically
investigated.
These sites are
rockshelters,
open
sites
and
cemeteries. The most commonly excavated are rockshelters, represented
by such sites as the Buzzard (Stephenson 1970) and Little Buzzard
(Long 1961) shelters, the Kyle site {Jelks 1962), Blum rockshelter
(Jelks 1953), and Bear Creek Shelter (Lynott 1978, 1980b).
Substantially fewer open sites from this stage have
been
investigated.
Certainly the best known of these is the Chupik Site,
first reported by Watt in 1953 and subsequently excavated by The
University of Texas at Austin field school in the summer of 1972. The
Clark (Watt 1965) and McDonald sites (Skinner et al. ms.; Chapter 39
this report) are also open sites.
Two Late Prehistoric cemeteries have been excavated by members of
the Central Texas Archeological Society. One cemetery, exposed during
the construction of the Waco sewage treatment plant, contained an
estimated 22 individuals ranging in age from 4 to 65 years. This site
was interpreted as a single mass interment, resulting from
a
prehistoric battle.
Several skeletons were incomplete, and the
presence of three Perdiz arrow points in one individual indicated a
violent death. The more or less random arrangement of the bodies and
the lack of grave goods indicated a less than ceremonious burial (Lux
1937;
Meroney 1936; Turner 1937; Watt and Meroney 1937a). At the
Asa Warner Site, at least two of the five burials contained projectile
points in their body cavities, suggesting violent deaths (Watt 1956).
The Late Prehistoric Austin and Toyah phases are characterized as
hunting
and
gathering
adaptations that adopted a distinctive
technology, the bow and arrow, previously unknown in the Central Texas
region (Jelks 1962:93;
Krieger 1946:163-168). The introduction of
the bow at the beginning of the Austin phase does not appear to have
substantially altered the basic adaptational system of the Central
Texas populations. Subsistence activities may have experienced a
slight shift to more reliance on hunting, particularly of deer, as
evidenced by the large quantities of deer bone recovered from these
sites.
The presence of East Texas cer~m1cs 1n the succeeding Toyah phase
sites indicates direct or indirect contact with the Caddoan groups of
that region (Jelks 1962:19;
Krieger 1946;
Watt 1953).
Jelks
(1962:92-94) has also postulated that some agriculture may have been
practiced during the Austin phase, but was abandoned in the subsequent
Toyah phase.
The evidence for such activities, however, is largely
conjectural, being based on the presence of a single corn cob at the
5-9

REGIONAL PREHISTORY
Kyle Site (Jelks 1962:113-115) and the location and nature of such
sites as Chupik. The reasons for the apparent failure of Central
Brazos populations to adopt agriculture in an area so well suited,
when groups with whom they had contact were farming, has yet to be
fully investigated.
The lack of farming may be more apparent than
real, however, representing nothing more than inadequate research
designs and procedures.
HISTORIC STAGE
The Historic Stage of the Central Brazos is represented by
evidence of several Native American groups. The original historic
inhabitants of this area were probably Tonkawan peoples related to
groups described by early explorers in South Central Texas (Newcomb
1961:133-153).
In I ight of the fact that they often attached
themselves to Anglo settlements for protection and economic support,
the Tonkawa are also the last Indian group to have been recorded in
the Central Brazos, possibly unti I as late as 1870 (Jelks 1970:281;
Stephenson 1970:110-111). Other groups, the Wichita speaking Tawakoni
and Wacos and the several Caddoan groups, were also present in the
Central Brazos area between 1778 and 1850. The fol lowing chapter of
this report discusses some of the Indian groups identified in the
region during the Historic Period.
Several archeological sites attributable to the Historic Indian
occupation of this area have been convincingly identified as vi I I ages
described by explorers and early settlers, as summarized by Story
(1980).
The Stansbury Site, at Lake Whitney, is Flechazo, which was
visited by De Mezieres in 1778 (Jelks 1970:277-286;
Stephenson
The Stone Site, across the Brazos from the mouth of
1970:58-111).
Aqui I la Creek, is probably Qui scat, visited by De Mezieres (Gregory
1973:218;
Harris and Harris 1967:132;
Jelks 1970:278). The Gas
Plant Site, on the outskirts of Waco, is probably the Tawakoni vi I I age
described by Duke in 1824 (Gregory 1973:218; Jensen 1967:45-47).
Story (1980) does not discuss the Caddo Jose Maria vi I lage, located
near old Fort Graham on the shores of Lake Whitney, described by
Roemer in 1846. Nor does she indicate that the Stansbury Site also
contained a component which has been tentatively identified as
relating to a short Caddoan occupation and as probably representing
the Old Towash vi I lage described in the early Texas records (Jelks
1970:282; Stephenson 1970:109-111). A single burial (Walton Site
41ML65) associated with the Wichita (Tawakoni) occupation of the
Central Brazos was located near the mouth of Aqui I la Creek (Story
1980).

CHAPTER 6
THE HISTORIC PERIOD IN CENTRAL HILL COUNTY

Jack M. Jackson

THE HISTORIC INDIANS
The period of early European contact in Hi I I County is not wel I
documented, especially when compared to those areas closer to the
Spanish settlements. The Spanish reports from the middle of the
eighteenth century mention the pressures and movements of native
populations in direct or indirect response to European settlement.
Research is also complicated by considerable confusion, in certain
secondary reports, about
tr i ba I
identity.
This
prob I em
is
particularly acute with the Towash Vi I I age which is now commemorated
by a state historical marker on the shores of Lake Whitney.
Tawakoni
Stephenson (1947:136), in his survey of the Whitney Basin took
the Towash name I iteral ly and interpreted it as a tribe closely
related to the "Taovayas" or "Tauhuaconi".
However, the bulk of
op1n1on tends toward the proper identification of this vi I I age site
with the Tawakoni (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954:95).
Under the
alternate spelling of "Tehuacana", a creek in Hi I I County and another
in Limestone County as wel I as a town and a group of hi I ls, are named
for this tribe. As reported by Reese (1961:25), the confusion seems
to have come about through the naming of the vi I lage for a later
chief, Towash, of the Hainai tribe which occupied the area briefly in
the nineteenth century.
The report of a Spanish soldier, Antonio Trevino, who was
captured and I ived among the Taovayas for six months, tends to lend
substance and some deta i I to the Tawakoni i dent if i cation.
In 1765,
when he was returned by the chief of the Taovayas to the Spanish
mission at Nacogdoches (Estes 1961(42):81ff), Trevino reported that he
had been held captive 140 leagues from Mission San Saba, an area
6-1

HISTORIC PERIOD
The Wichitas
probably near the headwaters of the Trinity River.
(Guichitas) I ived to the north of his captors and the Yscanis just to
the south, while some 50 leagues to the south I ived the Tawakonis
(Tehuacanas), allies of his captors against the Apache.
Trevino said that the vi I lage where he was held had only been
there since 1757 when the tribe had been forced south by enemies who
were better trained in the use of firearms (Estes 1961(42):108).
The
Tayovaya, who boasted two captured Spanish cannon in their fort,
traded with the French for muskets and powder as well as other
European goods.
The Tawakoni who reportedly occupied the Towash site in Hil I
County were probably driven south by the same forces at about the same
time as the Taovayas. Bernard de la Harpe found Taovaya, Tawakoni and
Yscani I iving on the Canadian River in Oklahoma in 1719 (Webb
1952:705). It appears likely that the Tawakoni and closely related
Wacos established themselves on the middle Brazos during the 1750s,
probably at the expense of the Apaches. The Tawakoni were apparently
al I ied with the Comanche (Estes 1961:108). John (1975:215) finds it
reasonable to equate the Tawakoni with one of the Wichita bands with
whom LaHarpe negotiated in 1719.
The Tawakoni spoke a language closely related to the Wichita and
thus of the Caddoan family of languages, but separated from the Caddo
language for about 30 centuries (Hughes 1968:83). They were a plains
dwel I ing tribe who cultivated corn, beans and melons near their homes
and lived in smal I vi I lages of conical grass huts.
Their occupation
of the Towash vi I I age terminated in 1824 when they abandoned the site
and moved north up the Brazos (Reese 1961:26).
The historic artifacts found on the bottom of Lake Whitney during
low water by local collectors and described in an appendix to the 1972
Southern Methodist University report on Lake Whitney may wel I be
associated with this occupation (Skinner and Gallagher 1972:appendix).
The Vinson Site, 41LT1, in neighboring Limestone County, has been
shown to be a Tawakoni vi I I age of some considerable size and has been
dated to the eighteenth century by European
artifacts.
This
excavation was the subject of a 1963 MA thesis by Dessamae Lorraine at
The University of Texas at Austin. Along with a number of artifacts,
several features identified as burned houses of the general Caddoan
round type, as wel I as a rectangular structure, were unearthed.

HISTORIC PERIOD
The Hasinai Confederacy
The Hainai and Anadarko tribes of the Caddo speaking Hasinai
Confederacy were indigenous to the east Texas areas now known as
Cherokee, Nacogdoches and Rusk counties. This, at least, is where
they were I iving when first encountered by the Spanish in the early
seventeenth century (Swanton 1942:7-12}. Between 1837 and 1843, both
tribes moved into Central Texas and settled briefly along the Trinity
River. Before 1848, they moved to the banks of the Brazos River in
Hi I I County (Reese 1961:33). It was this Caddoan confederacy which
had eight other constituent groups that the Spanish called Tejas
through the first century of contact (John 1975:165).
THE HAINAI
The Hainai tribe settled on the site of the old Tawakoni Vi I lage
abandoned in 1824.
Because the Hainai chief was named Towash, the
creek and vi I I age came to be known by that name. Some of the historic
artifacts reported washing out of a midden on the bottom of Lake
Whitney are possibly associated with this occupation (Skinner and
Gallagher 1972}.
THE ANADARKO
The Anadarko chief Jose Maria also gave his name to the larger
vi I I age north of the Hainai settlement. This vi I lage consisted of 150
dwel I ings (Winfrey 1960b:210-211} and was occupied sometime in the
middle 1840s. In 1846, Fredrick Roemer, a German, wrote a remarkably
good description of the vi I I age and its inhabitants:
The home of every family consisted of several huts of
diverse form.
There is always a large conical shaped hut
present, about fifteen feet high, which is enclosed on al I
sides except for a smal I opening at the bottom. It is
thatched with long grass and therefore at a distance
resembles a haystack of medium size. This hut is used in
cold and wet weather. Near it are several other huts, open
on the sides, which are really only grass-covered sheds,
resting on four uprights under which at a distance of about
two feet from the ground, a horizontal latticework platform,
woven from strong twigs, is fastened.
On this wicker
platform men and women squat during the hot hours of the
day. The roof shelters them from the hot sun's rays and at
the same time air can circulate freely on al I sides, even
from the bottom. Finally there was a third kind of hut used
for storing prov1s1ons which was nothing but an oven-like
container also covered with grass, resting on four high
posts.

THE KICKAPOO
There is a single, perhaps apocryphal report of a group of
Kickapoo Indians being present in Hi I I County in 1838. They too were
apparently opposed to the white

there.
A.Y.
Kirkpatrick (1963:22-23) reports the bloody fight between a party of
23 surveyors and a mixed group of Indians in southwestern Navarro
County in October of 1838. Some 300 Indians were camped on a buffalo
hunt.
There were not "Wi Id Comanches with
bows
and

(Kirkpatrick 1963:22-23), but the far more formidable Kickapoos with
rifles.
THE COMANCHE
The Comanches are frequently mentioned as visiting Hi I I County in
hunting or raiding parties. They were apparently fond of using the
Cross Timbers region to cover their movements south into
the
settlements as wel I as their northward retreats with horses and booty.
No reference to an extensive Comanche settlement can be found.
The
Comanches were highly nomadic and there is no indication that they did
more in Hi I I County than camp briefly while hunting.
THE DELAWARE
About 1820, a smal I group of Delaware Indians, originally from
the New York-Pennsylvania area, came into Texas. Between about 1840
and 1846 they had a large camp on Chambers Creek near the Hi I I-Ellis

Fort Graham: Indians and the Frontier Forts
The United States Army established a I ine of forts along the
frontier in the late 1840s, fol lowing the war with Mexico. Fort Worth
was one such that grew into a thriving community. Fort Graham in Hi I I
County was established in 1849 just north of Jose Maria's vi I lage on
the Brazos. These forts mark the end of the era of Indian dominion in
The settlers came to supply the fort and, by 1850, the
Hil I County.
census showed a substantial population in the vicinity, ranging from a
number of single ladies w~o listed themselve~ as laundresses to
cattlemen supplying beef.
After the winter hunting season of 1851, old Chief Jose Maria
refused to return to the vi I I age beside the fort. Both the Anadarko
and the Hainai under Chief Towash established a new vi I I age on a
fami I iar campground on the Brazos about 35 miles north of Fort Graham.
The tribes remained there unti I 1854 when they were moved to the
Brazos reservation (Reese 1961:41). The end of Indian occupation is
marked by a bland report from the Army at Fort Graham in early 1853
that "no Indians have visited the post since last Autumn except a
smal I party of Caddoes and I'onies" (Reese 1961:41).
Hi I I County, as we have seen in this section, remained very
largely 1n the hands of the Indians with very few settlers unti I the
building of Fort Graham.
The era of the Texas Republic
was
essentially over by the time Europeans began to settle in the county,
in spite of the fact that some of the land grants date from that time.
THE FRONTIER ERA
Early European Travelers
Athanase de Mezieres, a French nobleman, who had been appointed
Spanish Governor in Nacogdoches, traveled northeast across the Trinity
River and then on to the Brazos River where he visited a Tawakoni
vii lage (Reese 1961:26) in the spring of 1772. In 1786, another
Frenchman, employed by the Spanish to scout the shortest route to
Santa Fe, spent three months at a Tawakoni vi I I age on the Brazos near
Waco. Upon leaving the vi I I age, Pierre Vial traveled up the east side
of the Brazos to reach the Red River which he fol lowed west to Santa
Fe. Thus, it is certain that he passed through Hi I I County.
Phi I ip Nolan, a Yankee horse trader, first came to Texas about
1790 and made several trips into the interior to capture wild horses.
He excited the fears of the Spanish colonial government.
Nolan and
his party were camped on the banks of Battle Creek, a branch of
Nolan's River near Blum in Hi I I County, on March 22, 1801 when they
6-5

HISTORIC PERIOD
were attacked by a Spanish military force of 75 men (Reese 1961:25).
Nolan himself was ki I led. Some of his companions who surrendered were
held prisoner by the Spanish for seven years. The site of Nolan's
camp was also reputed to be along Nolan's Creek in Bel I County, but
David Donoghue located the site 1n Hi I I County after extensive
research (Jackson 1938:354-355).
Twenty years after the Nolan incident, the Spanish granted Moses
Austin the right to bring in Anglo settlers. Although it would be
almost half a century before the Anglos actually settled in Hi I I
County in any number, the impact of the frontier was felt throughout
the first half of the nineteenth century.
Fort Smith
The Republic of Texas stationed a smal I ranger force in Hi I I
County in the Fal I of 1845.
This was a detachment of the 30 man
Central Texas Rangers commanded by Thomas I. Smith (Reese 1961:44).
Ten of these men were assigned to camp near the head of Richland Creek
in northeast Hi I I County; this camp was later dubbed "Fort Smith" by
the men in honor of their commanding officer. A marker was placed at
the supposed location of the "Fort" during the 1936 Texas centennial
but the site selected was by no means firm.
Some people have
suggested that the men camped nearer the Turner house, a pioneer
dwel I ing about 200 yards away.
The detachment of Rangers in Hi I I County was commanded by
Sergeant James Stanford, and included W.H. Young who later served as
both county judge and state legislator for the county, and Buck Barry
who was later sheriff in nearby Navarro County. We have Barry's own
account of the Ranger's activities in Hi I I County:
We have but two positive orders from our captain.
One
was that each squad should patrol its section of our I ine
every day, running near and along the lower edge of the
cross
timbers, and to see that no Indians took the
settlements by surprise. In case we discovered Indians or
their trail going toward the settlements, it was our
business to beat them there and notify the minutemen of
their coming. Every settler was a minuteman. In fact every
man in Texas was a soldier, organized into minute-companies
and required to keep forty rounds of ammunition and to be
ready to start at a moments warning . . .
The other special order we had from Captain Smith was
to get into no fight or conf I ict with Indians, as he truly
said no deadman could make a report to the minutemen. Never
more than three of us ever went on patrol at the same time,
and sometimes only one was sent. (Greer 1932:24-25).

HISTORIC PERIOD
There is no record of the Rangers losing even one of the men
stationed at Fort Smith.
In July 1846, Governor Henderson ordered
Smith to concentrate his men at Conner's Station in Hi I I County from
which they operated for the next two years (Reese 1961:47).
The Army Cornes to Hi I I County
Conner's Station was one of the posts taken over by the United
States Army from the Rangers in November 1848 after the end of the
Mexican War. On February 8, 1849, General Wi I liam J. Worth, who would
later have a smal I frontier fort named for him, ordered companies I
and F of the Second Dragoons to leave Conner's Station and establish a
more permanent camp at Towash Vi I Iage (Knight 1953:232).
Major Ripley A. Arnold, an 1838 graduate of West Point, was made
commanding officer and soon had work underway, erecting temporary
buildings on the Towash site which he cal led Camp Thornton in honor of
a captain of the Second Dragoons who had been ki I led in the Mexican
War (Reese 1961:49). An inspection trip by Brevet Brigadier General
W.S. Harney from Austin in March of 1849 ended the bui Iding of Camp
Thornton. Harney thought it a poor location and found another site
six miles up the Brazos River near Jose Maria Vi I Iage. The new post
was officially established March 27, 1849, and named Fort Graham, in
honor of General Wi I I iam G. Graham who was ki I led in the battle of
Molino Del Rey (Knight 1953:235).
FORT GRAHAM
It is really from the bui Iding of Fort Graham that sets apart the
Indian era the era of European settlement in Hi I I County. It was not,
however, that the Indians were so hostile that settlement was not
possible unti I the Fort was bui It. Indeed, Hi I I County occupied a
singularly peaceful section of the frontier.
Except for the 1838 surveyors fight along Battle Creek in what is
now Navarro County, there appears to have been no cases where Indians
ki I led Anglos or vice versa during the entire frontier era. The Army
itself had I ittle to fear from the Indians. Fort Graham was hardly
the high walled palisade fort of the movie western.
It looked more
I ike an orderly crossroads vi I Iage where the roads from Austin, Waco
and Fort Worth met. The best bui Iding, a stone officer's quarters
with two 15 by 16 foot rooms (Knight 1953:53), no doubt sheltered
Major Arnold. Most other buildings were made of logs with the more
important ones having sawn lumber weather boarding nailed to the
outside. At the time, sawn lumber had to be transported from Porter's
Bluff on the Trinity River over 120 miles away (Knight 1953:55).
After abandonment by the Army, the fort actually became a smal I
civi I ian community that flourished for many years. Theryl S. Penny's
6-7

HISTORIC PERIOD
book (1974) has documented the history of that community so wel I that
we need say I ittle more here.
The site of old Fort Graham was
inundated by the waters of Lake Whitney some years ago.
The Murder of Major Arnold

There is, however, one tale that must be told about the Fort
which no brief history of the county could omit. It reflects the
intense personal loyalties that governed much of the American
frontier.
There
are
several versions of the tale in print
(Kirkpatrick 1963; Bailey 1966). Possibly the best researched and
certainly the most complete version appears in James V. Reese's
Master's thesis (1961:88-96). Only the bare out I ines of the story
wi I I be repeated here.
Dr. Steiner, the post surgeon at Fort Graham, and Major Arnold,
commanding officer of the Second Dragoons, had never gotten along
wel I. After being absent from Fort Graham to found Fort Worth and
accomplish other tasks, Arnold and his Dragoons returned to Fort
Graham in mid-August, 1853. On September 6, 1853, Doctor Steiner shot
and ki I led the major.
Steiner, as the only doctor in Hi I I County, was much appreciated
by the frontiersmen to whom he had freely rendered his professional
services. At his initial hearing before the county judge, it was
decided that the doctor need not stand trial because he had ki I led the
major in self defense. But Steiner 1 s request for a trial to clear his
name was granted and a date set with the District Court for the next
summer.
Meanwhile, the Army had decided that the matter should be tried
before a court martial. In Apri 11 1854 1 a General Court Martial with
General Harney heading the panel met in Austin, but Steiner failed to
appear. Lieutenant Anderson of the Second Dragoons, who was in Austin
as a witness, was ordered to take a troop of soldiers back to Hi I I
County and arrest the doctor.
Outside of Hi I I County, the pioneer newspapers saw Steiner as a
cold blooded murderer (Northern Standard 9/24/1853). Steiner was
actually taken into custody by the mi I itary and brought to Waco.
In
Waco, the Hil I County sheriff, who had fol lowed the army detachment,
convinced a Justice of the Peace to issue a warrant for the arrest of
Steiner and the apprehension of Lt. Anderson, his mi I itary captor.
The next morning, the entire military party was placed under arrest by
the sheriff of Mclennan County. Steiner was returned to Hi I I County
in the custody of Sheriff Davis and acquitted at a civi I trial during
the June term of the District Court. The Army apparently dropped

attempt

Fort Graham Abandoned
The rapidly advancing frontier of settlement, not the wi I lful
obstruction of the Army in the Steiner affair, caused the abandonment
of Fort Graham. As we have seen previously, Jose Maria refused to
bring his people back to their vii lage on the Brazos in 1851; by the
Fal I of 1853 Fort Graham was the last of the original line of forts
that was stil I occupied by the Army. On November 9, 1853, it was also
abandoned and the troops sent further west to Fort Richardson (Reese
1961:96).
Influence of the Fort on Settlement
The economic realities of a Federal government post disbursing
$1500 a month for horses, feed, provisions and other supplies, placed
at the edge of settlement where land was cheap and hard cash rare, are
not hard to grasp.
If the Army was buying beef and corn, the
cattlemen and farmers to supply them would soon be close at hand.
If
supplies from the coast required teamsters to transport them, these
too would appear at the gates.
Although Jose Maria and his people were not hostile to the
Anglos, the mere fact that a United States Army post was close at hand
would encourage settlement apart from the economic motives out I ined
above.
Many of the earliest settlers picked home sites along the
creeks that flowed through the Cross Timbers region. Timber for fuel
and building homes was not to be found on the prairies. Kirkpatrick
(1963:34) relates that his family drove several miles through the tal I
grass to cut logs for their first home. The region along Aqui Ila
Creek was the closest source. Perhaps the earliest settlement in what
is now Hi I I County was in the cross timbers just west of Hi I lsboro.
Lexington
One of the first settlements in Hi I I County grew up around the
home of a cattleman and storekeeper, John G. "Jack" Boiles, on a
branch of Hackberry Creek that is sti I I known today as "Jack's
Branch".
The census taker found the 21 year old rancher and his 18
year old wife, Mary, I iving there in October, 1850, and Reese
(1961:Appendix 1) supposes that they settled there about 1849. Boiles
patented two tracts in his own name and another 260 acre tract using
the headright certificate of Wi I I iam Cook which he had purchased.
Boiles raised cattle and soon kept a store with a partner, Harrison
Ables.
The store was stocked with goods hauled in from Porter's

and

D.C. Wornel

Bailey (1966:50-53), in his account of the vi I Iage of Lexington,
argues against a prevai I ing local tradition that Lexington was the
first vi I Iage in Hi II County, finding no evidence for its existence
before 1852. Several facts, however, appear to contradict his claim.
In 1853, Harrison Ables was sel I ing lots in the "town of Lexington" to
J.C. Harper and J.E. Arrington (Hi I I County Deed Book H:178-179). In
1854, John Morris and his wife, Edy, traded for a house that had been
previously occupied, located in the "town of Lexington . . . Block 7,
Lot No. 6" (Hi I I County Clerk, Deed Book H:61).
"John G. Boiles,
stockkeeper" and "J.M. Stiner (sic), physician" are both shown in the
1850 census. Examination of the Abstract Book (Hi I I County Abstract
Company Book 1:12) shows that the vi I I age of Lexington was located on
the 269 acre tract purchased by John G. Boiles.
The town was
sufficiently organized to have been the site of the first county
election on May 14, 1853. The Hi I I County tax rol I for 1853 I ists 76
property owners. No town lots were taxed and no towns are named. The
fol lowing year, 1854, J.H. Barnett is shown on the tax rol Is as the
owner of two lots in Lexington, valued at $70. John Morris and James
Stewart were also lot owners. No other town lots are shown in the tax
returns.
Thus, it appears that the local tradition regarding
Lexington is wel I founded.
LOCATION OF LEXINGTON
A deed (Hi I I County Clerk, Deed Book H:60) for 3 acres of land
sold by John Morris to Benjamin C. Wil Iiams "partly in the town of
Lexington" refers to one corner stake near "Grove Creek". Al I of the
early deeds examined refer to the stream now cal led Jack's Branch as
Grove Creek. The parcel described was a 20 by 20 rod square with one
corner near the creek and a portion in the town of Lexington.
Therefore, the vii lage lay within 300 feet of the creek.
The location determined from deeds and other documents places the
site of Lexington north of the Hickey Cemetery on the west bank of
Jack's Branch. This location is about 1.7 miles south of the State
Historic roadside marker on Route 22 near the Jack's Branch Bridge.
At least a portion of the site wi I I be inundated by Aqui I la Lake and
some of it wi I I be affected by wave action, but the bulk of the site
appears to be outside the flood pool.
Creation of the County

commissioners court of Hi I I County was held on May 25, 1853. These

HISTORIC PERIOD
men had been elected eleven days earlier by about 75 voters (Reese
1961:81), who had cast their ballots at the Lexington store under the
superv1s1on of the county judge of Navarro County. Thomas M. Steiner
(brother of Dr. J.M. Steiner), Thomas Bragg and James R. Davis were
elected commissioners and Cinncinnatus Ney (C.N.) Brooks was chosen as
County Clerk. James H. Dyer was elected Chief Justice (County Judge)
(Anon. 1892:227, 406-407).
Very I ittle business was transacted at
this meeting of the county court.
William Wi Ison was appointed
Sheriff and the court voted to pay Judge Donaldson of Navarro County
twelve dollars "out pf the first money that may be received into the
treasury of the court" (Anon. 1892:228).
Â·
The men who were elected to this court are fairly typical of the
early Hi I I County settlers. James Rans Davis, from Tennessee, settled
in the northeast section of the county in 1849. Davis kept a smal I
store in his house and farmed his land.
Thomas M. Steiner came to the county in 1852, joining his brother
Dr. J.M. Steiner.
Both men were avid buyers of land for resale.
Dr. Steiner had been a prime mover in the circulation of the petition
which led to the creation of the county from the western part of
Navarro
County
(Reese
1961:77).
J.M. Steiner's
letters
to
E.S.C. Robertson, a large landowner in Hi I I County and official in the
General Land Office in Austin, suggest that the stimulation of
settlement for the sake of land prof its was a primary motive. Thomas
Steiner was primarily a land speculator and adventurer who Thomas
resigned as County Commissioner in 1856 to join the filibuster
expedition of "General" Wi I I iam Walker. Steiner was ki I led an the
fighting
when Walker attempted to overthrow the government of
Nicaragua. The Hi I I County voters replaced Steiner with Thomas Bragg,
a 33 year old farmer from Alabama.
Both Judge J.H. Dyer and C.N. Brooks came from Georgia in 1853
(Reese 1961:83) and settled near a large spring north of present
Hillsboro cal led the "Mountain Springs" community. The "mountain" in
question is named with characteristic frontier humor. Both Brooks and
Dyer bui It substantial houses. Kirkpatrick (1963:33) remarks on the
fact that Brooks hauled in sawn lumber and sent al I the way to Houston
for nai Is to erect a clapboard house (the trial of Dr. Steiner was
actually held in Brooks' home which burned in 1923). Both these men
were primarily ranchers; both remained active in Hi I I County politics
for many years.
When elections were held for permanent county officials during
the summer of 1853, Judge Dyer was opposed by Thomas Bel I. On
election day, a brawl broke out between the two men and their
supporters.
Judge Dyer, before he was forced to flee, shot and
wounded one of the Bel I supporters. Dyer was re-elected.
6-11

HISTORIC PERIOD
C.N. Brooks was perhaps not so colorful, but had many talents.
He surveyed the site of Hi I lsboro in 1853 and erected the first county
courthouse. This modest structure was a 12 by 12 foot elm pole cabin
with a dirt floor and a board roof held on by weight poles. In June
of 1854 (by which time C.N. Brooks had been appointed the first
postmaster of Hi I lsboro), the county court appropriated $200 to erect
a larger (30 X 25) courthouse.
The gravemarker of C.N. Brooks in Hickey Cemetery shows that he
was born Apri I 16, 1825, and died September 15, 1890. Thus he was 1n
his late twenties when he became County Clerk, Postmaster county
surveyor and bui Ider of courthouses. There are also gravemarkers for
three women
relatives:
wives,
sisters
or
daughters
(Mary
T. 1833-1853, Sarah 1838-1920 and Anna Wood 1877-1899).
ANTEBELLUM SETTLEMENT
During the seven years between the abandonment

The activities of Reverend John S. Patton, the founding minister
of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in Peoria, i I lustrate the
interest in land speculation. In 1848, while still a resident of
El I is County, Patton purchased the headright certificate of Thomas
Watson for one-third of a league. A parcel of this size was surveyed
in October, 1849, on both sides of Aqui I la Creek about two miles south
of Peoria (Hi I I County Abstract Co. 1:138).
The land was finally
patented to Reverend Patton in February, 1853. He began sel I ing smal I
parcels to settlers the fol lowing year. John Veale bought 213 acres
May 30, 1854 (Hi I I County Clerk, Book H:l59). Al I sales noted were
made at prices of three dollars an acre or less before the Ci vi I War.
The tax rol Is show that Patton was sti I I owner of 814 of the Watson
acres 1n 1854, had sold al I but 484 by 1860, but held 498 acres of the
grant in 1861. Sales had stopped and foreclosures had begun.
This was not the only land in which the Reverend Patton had an
interest.
He bought 1,280 acres of the John S. Hobley grant from
James E. Patton in 1855 (Hi I I County Clerk, Book 4:384). In the deed,
both parties are sti I I residents of El I is County. There is some doubt
that the Reverend became a resident of Hi I I County unti I after 1858.
He is not I isted in the county tax rol Is for 1856 or 1857 even though
he owned considerable acreage there.

HISTORIC PERIOD
Patton's Mi I I
Both A.Y. Kirkpatrick and El I is Bailey (1966:44) state that
Reverend Patton bui It and operated a mi I I on Aqui I la Creek south of
Peoria in the early 1850s.
A smal I settlement which later was
popularly cal led Mud Town, grew up around this mi I I. When the Central
Texas Rai I road bui It through Hil I County after the Ci vi I War, the town
was moved to the rai I road and renamed Aqui I la. This firm historic
documentation led the author far astray.
Because a mi I I site would have to be located on the creek and
because a great deal of the basin of Aqui I la Creek wi I I be filled by
the lake, it was considered essential to locate the original site of
Patton's Mi I I.
Reasoning that the mi I I might have been built on
either the John S. Hobley survey or the Thomas Watson survey, both
owned by Reverend Patton, on-ground explorations were undertaken.
Walking along the creek in the central part of the Hobley survey after
a particularly heavy rain convinced the writer that no mi I I could have
been bui It in the vicinity. Even though Aqui I la Creek was flowing
over the bridge just south of the dam site, the flow two miles north
was a mere trickle. It became evident that something was very wrong
with the local tradition reported by Bailey. The complete listing of
John S. Patton's holdings was checked in the tax rol Is.
The
Industrial Schedules of the U.S. Census for 1860 and 1870 were
examined. Other mi I Is and even blacksmith shops were shown, but there
was no mi I I owned by John S. Patton or any other Patton in Hi I I
County. There was no indication of any radical change in hydrology in
the last 100 years.
The first clues to the identity of the real Patton and the
location of the mi I I came with finding a G.W. Patton appointed as
Postmaster of Aqui I la by the Confederate Government (Wheat ms.).
Then, the 1870 Industrial schedules of the Census indicated that a
steam driven cotton gin was owned by G.W. Patton, but in Mclennan
County.
Investigation of the Mclennan County tax records showed that
taxes on the Moses W. Burleson 640 acre tract which actually lies in
Hi I I County had been paid for some years to Mclennan County by the
Patton brothers.
A branch of Aqui Ila Creek flows through this
property.
Five miles south-southwest of the present town of Aqui I la, just
north of the Mclennan County I ine on Patton Branch, the current USGS
topographic map shows a Patton Lake which turns out to be several mi I I
ponds.
There are two large, well defined ponds formed by dams across
the main stream, and several smaller, rectangular ponds.
This
evidence, and the tax records on the Burleson grant, confirmed the
location of "Patton's mi I I" and Mud Town.
Because this site was
outside the designated survey area, it was not further documented.

The anonymous Memorial and Biographical History of Johnson and
Hil I Counties (1892) furnished the confirming detai Is.
George
W-:-15'atton was the youngest son of J.W.
Patton and Narcissa (nee
Colvin) Patton. The elder Patton was a veteran of the War of 1812, a
native New Yorker, a mi Iler and a merchant. The entire family moved
to Texas by sea in 1860. Their household goods and a complete set of
machinery for a flour mi I I and saw mi I I were moved by ox drawn wagon
from Aransas Pass.
After six weeks travel they arrived in the
northern part of Mclennan County. The father and mother died shortly
after their arrival, but the Patton brothers, 36 year old George and
his brother Nathan, set up the mi I I and began operations.
When the
Ci vi I War broke out, the Pattons were newly arrived Yankees deep in
Rebel territory. Nathan left the area, but George was determined to
stay in business.
Apparently, he was able to do so through the war
years, even serving as Confederate Postmaster for the smal I settlement
around his mi I I. During the bitter days of Reconstruction, the mi I I
was burned four times by vandals and rebui It each time. When the 1870
census was taken, the mi I I was not in operation but the steam driven
cotton gin was I isted. Burned for the fifth time, by accident, in
1884, the old mi I I was not rebui It. The cotton gin, in partnership
between James McGee and G.W. Patton after 1881, was the business that
was moved to Aqui I la. In 1892, George Patton (born March 24, 1824)
was 68 years old and I iving with his brother in Waco.
When
A.Y. Kirkpatrick recorded the early settlers' accounts after the turn
of the century, this Patton, who never married, was forgotten.
The Dyer Mi I I at Towash
Judge J.H. Dyer and his brother, Simpson C. Dyer, also owned an
extensive mi I I ing business on the Brazos River near the Towash
community. This mi I I was begun with the construction of a dam across
the Brazos River which was finished in late November, 1855, when work
on the mi I I itself was undertaken (letter of J.M. Steiner
to
E.S.C. Robertson, Fort Graham, November, 28 1 1858. Robertson Papers).
Bailey (1966:32) gives the date as 1857 or 1858 for completion of the
mi I I.
This mi I I operated unti I destroyed by a flood in 1902. In any
case, by the time the census of 1860 was taken, the Towash mi I I was a
thriving business, with the Dyer brothers listed as partners in the
enterprise. The flour mi I I produced 3,500 barrels a year valued at
$25,000.
With only $10,000 original investment and three employees
making twenty dollars each per month, this was clearly a profitable
venture. In addition, a sawmi I I which produced $9,000 worth of lumber
and a blacksmith shop that produced sales of $2,500 annually, were
also operated by the Dyer brothers. In spite of al I this, the Dyers
were not the leading industrialists in Hi I I County.

HISTORIC PERIOD
Slaveholders
In terms of cash value of products, the leading industrialist of
the county in 1860 was James J. Gathings, the founder of the town of
Covington. Gathings came to Texas in 1852 from South Carolina with a
caravan of 20 wagons loaded with everything he might need on the
frontier plus a large number of highly ski I led slaves.
These slaves
bui It a mi I I, a tannery, a shoe and boot shop, a saddle and harness
shop, a furniture making facility, looms for weaving and a brickyard
(Reese 1961:104). Out of the 10,000 acres he purchased, Gathings laid
out the town of Covington and offered free lots of two to ten acres to
families who would settle there.
The town was named in honor of
Martha Wal I Covington, Gathing's wife.
In the 1860 industrial census, a steam powered flour mi I I with an
annual production of $24,000 and a saw mi I I producing $12,000 worth of

rai I road came, Covington was the largest and most economically
prosperous community in the county (Reese 1961:105).
The 120 slave owners shown in the 1860 census owned a total of
650 Blacks. Seventy-three owners held less than four and only 16 had
ten slaves or more. The Gathing's 45 slaves were by far the largest
number.
John Greenwade, a settler in the Towash area, also owned a
number of slaves but he was not a classic plantation operator.
Greenwade operated a ferry across the Brazos, grew some grain, raised
cattle and kept a store. E.C. Zollicoffer, who settled near Ash Creek
in 1854, was another who did not fit the classic plantation pattern.
He owned 23 slaves and 2,100 acres of land, but only 300 acres were
under cultivation; the bulk of his land was a cattle ranch.
There were no plantations in Hi I I County before the Ci vi I War.
The most common pattern was that of the Upper South subsistence farmer
who cultivated only a few acres. Of the 211 farms shown in the 1860
census (Agricultural Schedules, ms microfi Im), only 43 contained more
than 100 acres and most of these had only a few acres actually
planted.
For example, James George, who owned 640 acres, only had 35
under cultivation. Many of these smal I farmers grew what they needed
on less than 15 acres.
During the Antebellum period, settlers moved into the county 1n
increasing numbers, buying fairly smal I farms from landowners such as
the Reverend John S. Patton. Sales of 40 acre farms were common
throughout the 1860s. Most sales were for cash.
An excel lent example of the common, middle class, farmstead is
partially preserved on the M. Castleman Survey just west of Rocky
Branch of Hackberry Creek. The site which has been designated 41HI173

has the foundation of a substantial double pen dogtrot log house with
two fireplaces, a wel I and some log outbui Iding ruins.
Very I imited
test excavations were conducted at this site and are reported below.
A search of the land records shows that the tract on which this
site is located contained 175 acres and was purchased by Thomas B.
Elliot in 1858 for the sum of $851.35 (Hi I I County Clerk, Deed Book
C:347).
The tax rol Is of 1859 show Elliot t~xed on his land, 10
horses, 83 head of cattle, a wagon and a team of oxen. This property
was valued at $2118 total and a state and county tax of $7.28 was
assessed.
El I iot sold the farm in 1861 to Harvey Young who resold it to
Levan W. Anderson of Tarrant County in 1863 for 2,000 inf lated
Confederate dollars. Anderson also owned three slaves (1864 Hi I I
County Tax Roi I, ms microfi Im State Archives). Levan W. Anderson and
his wife I ived out their I ives on the farm and are the probable
builders of the structures mentioned above.
The Andersons are buried in Hickey Cemetery under a single large
white marble monument that shows Levan W. Anderson was born in 1818
and died in 1884; his wife, "E.L." died in 1897 at age 71. The farm
was inherited by several heirs at that time and was eventually owned
by Sam Anderson.
The 640 acres of the M. Castleman Survey on which this farm was
located were sold by Andrew S. Castleman for $13.50 cash, 2 horses
valued at $100 each, and 2 personal notes for an unknown balance to
Edward Brown in 1856 (Hi I I County Abstract Co. vol. 1:47). The bulk
of this acreage wi I I go under the waters of Aqui I la Lake but the house
site wi I I be above the flood pool on the western shore of the Rocky
Branch arm of the lake. A report of the test excavations here ts
found elsewhere in this report.
Summary
Antebellum Hil I County was sti I I largely frontier at the opening
of the Ci vi I War. The town of White Rock had been a Post Office since
1852, less than ten years. Peoria's Postmaster, Henry Young, had only
been appointed in March 1856. The county courthouse was sti I I a log
structure and the county seat a smal I collection of mostly vacant
lots, but was already overshadowing nearby Lexington as a commercial
center. Most of the sti I I sparse population was subsistence farmers,
but owning a few slaves was not uncommon. The future looked bright,
in spite of the gathering clouds of the Ci vi I War.

HISTORIC PERIOD
THE CIVIL WAR ERA
As shown in the previous section, the population of Hil I County
in 1860 was mostly composed of white smal I farm owners with 120 slave
owners. These slaves constituted a considerable financial asset. The
price of prime field hands had been rising at a steady pace during the
1850s and had reached a range of $1,200-$1,500 by 1860.
In other
words, a good field hand was worth as much as a 500 acre farm. This
obvious financial interest coupled with a great and often irrational
fear of the consequences of abolition made the reaction of Hil I County
residents to the crisis of 1860 both understandable and predictable.
The Election of 1860
In the election of 1860, the traditional Democratic Party was
split into three factions, al I of which had a separate nominee for
president. The majority of Hi I I County voters, or 391 persons, voted
for John C. Breckenridge, the nominee of the "Southern Democratic"
party. The Constitutional Union Party>s nominee, John Bel I, got 130
votes.
The national Democratic Party nominee, Steven A. Douglas, got
only seven votes. Not a single vote was cast in favor of the winner
of the 1860 election, Abraham Lincoln (Burnham 1955:786).
Secession
Soon after the election, Judge J.H. Dyer, Jackson Puckett and
John T. Eubank circulated a petition in the county asking Governor Sam
Houston to cal I a special session of the legislature to consider "the
best mode of action for the safety of our property, lives and honors"
(Texas State Archives ms. file Governors Letters, December 8, 1860).
Although Sam Houston was firmly opposed to Secession, a convention was
cal led. The people of Hi I I County elected Joseph P. Weir, a Hi I lsboro
attorney and radical secessionist to represent them in the convention.
Actually the 41st Congressional District which comprised Hi I I and
Navarro counties elected two delegates to the convention. Weir of
Hi I I County got 750 votes and his radical running mate, Joseph
A. Clayton of Navarro County got 755 votes. There were only 957
ballots voted in the district. Hi I I County was clearly for leaving
the Union. It should be noted that Weir, the publisher and founder of
the first newspaper in Hi I I County, the Hi I lsboro Express, al lowed the
type from his print shop to be melted down for bullets and organized
one of the first Volunteer Confederate Military units from the county
(Reese 1961:122).

6-17

HISTORIC PERIOD
Mi I itary Units from Hi I I County
Weir organized Company A of the Twelfth Texas Cavalry which
became part of "Parsons' Brigade". After brief service training near
Waco and a few months in Galveston as the Fourth Cavalry of Texas
State Troops, the "Brigade" was made part of the Confederate Army and
saw action in Arkansas, Missouri and Louisiana (Parsons 1903).
Captain_ Weir was ki I led at the battle of Yellow Bayou, Louisiana, May
18, 1864.
Company D of the Nineteenth Texas Cavalry was also composed
largely of Hi I I County volunteers. David Crockett Wornel served in
this unit and I ies under a C.S.A.
soldiers tombstone in Hickey
Cemetery even though he I ived until November 2, 1924. His older
brother John M. Wornel, with whom he came to Hi I I County, served 1n
Company F of the Seventh Regiment Texas Cavalry and did not survive
the War. These two men had supplied the store at Lexington, hauling
goods from Porter's Bluff and Houston in the early days.
Jackson Puckett who had earlier been a land agent attempting to
rename abandoned Fort Graham "Robertson" and sel I lots to settlers,
organized another unit in 1862. This company served in the Thirteenth
Texas Cavalry (sometimes cal led the First Texas Partisan Rangers)
which saw duty in Indian Territory (Reese 1961:125). In July 1863 a
letter to Governor Lubbock (Texas State Archives ms. file Governors
Letters, Lubbock) claimed that "not under 700 men" had been supplied
to the cause of southern I iberty by a county with only 500 voters. It
is impossible to verify this claim; however, the most complete roster
of C.S.A. soldiers from Hi I I County is contained in Ellis Bailey's
book (1966). Bailey states that even this list is not complete and
contains names which perhaps should not be included.
The Home Front
The war brought shortages of the smal I comforts of I ife.
According to A.Y. Kirkpatrick "it was a common thing to be without
coffee, sugar, soda, or salt for weeks at a time" (1963:77-78).
Expeditions to Mexico were organized to bring back supplies to the
county (Kirkpatrick 1963:74). Land speculators sometimes lost their
lands because they could not pay creditors and many parcels of land
were sold at pub I ic auction.
On the other hand, land values as
measured in the inf lated Confederate currency, were going up at a fast
rate. Those who had money found I ittle else to buy with it.

6-18

HISTORIC PERIOD
The Miguel Zunigas Grant
An example of the land value inflation can be taken from the
History of the Miguel Zunigas Survey on lower Hackberry Creek (Fig.
6.1). In 1847, Zuni gas was given a certificate for 320 acres which he
sold the same day in San Antonio. Samuel Wi Ison used this certificate
to patent 320 acres along Hackberry Creek in 1852. Six years later he
sold the land to L.W. Cato, the operator of a horse powered grist
mi I I. Cato resold the land a year later for Sl,000 (March 19, 1859).
Wi I liam Swank bought the 320 acres on July 11, 1860 for Sl,200 and
resold it November 14, 1864 for $6,250! Jenkins Davis, who paid that
price, sold off the 85 acres northwest of Hackberry Creek in 1878, but
the remainder of this land stayed in the Davis family unti I the 1890s
(Hi II County Abstract Co. Book 1).
The Refugees
The land records of Hi I I County show a steady stream of fami I ies
buying smal I farms throughout the War years. Many fami I ies fled the
war-torn southern states to the east and sought homes away from the
direct threat of invaders. It might have been difficult to get salt
in Hil I County, but this was a far cry from the hardships of the
Georgians, Alabamans and Virginians whose homes and crops were burned
after their animals and valuables had been stolen. Many of the people
who came to Hi I I County during the War were refugees.
The Veterans
While the population of Hi I I County was supplemented by refugees
during the War, it also lost fewer men to the War than most counties.
Because the Hi I I County companies served on relatively inactive fronts
(Reese 1961:132), less than 20 widows received pensions from the
county. Of the 80 men who served in Captain Weir's Company, only four
died in action and another of natural causes while on active duty
(Parsons 1903:41). When the War ended on June 19, 1865, most of the
men who had gone returned again.
It was perhaps this large number of able bodied Confederate
veterans
and
the large number of wartime refugees that made
Reconstruction such a bitter and difficult ti~e for Hi I I County.
RECONSTRUCTION

pictured as vi I la ins, while the Confederate veterans and former civi I
officials of the Confederacy are portrayed as their victims. In some
cases the most notorious outlaws are pictured as stalwart men hounded
by the seal lawags and carpetbaggers.
Even Bailey's 1966 history of Hi I I County tends toward this view:
Some sorry carpetbagger would send the Negro police to
arrest you without a writ on any trumped up charge. If you
did not give any trouble and paid the assessed fine, the
next day they would be back saying your fine was doubled.
(Bailey 1966:122).
Most historians since the 1950s have pointed out that the State Pol ice
had some freedmen, but was also led by the same men who later were
cal led the Texas Rangers and judged to be heroic lawmen.
The fact
that such a view of the Reconstruction years could endure so long
speaks to the depth of the bitterness of defeat.
During this period outlawry was rampant, the Ku Klux Klan and
vigi Iantes rode through the night, county officials were removed,
sheriffs ki I led and men hung. Between 1860 and 1870, the population
more than doubled, reaching 7,429 persons, and the acres of land in
cultivation also more than doubled, reaching 23,296 by 1870 (Census,
Agricultural Schedules, 1870 ms. microf i Im Texas State Archives). The
old subsistence agriculture gave way to the growing of cash crops. By
1870, cotton and corn had replaced wheat as the dominant crops on Hi I I
County farms. Slow economic recovery from the War is, however, only
the backdrop before which the violent political incidents and acts of
lawlessness were to be played.
A Merry-Go-Round of County Officials
It was almost two months after the formal end of the War before
the newly appointed Governor of Texas, A.J. Hamilton, got around to
appointing officials for Hi I I County.
On August 17, 1865, he
appointed J.W.P. Doyle County Judge, David Crockett Wornel Sheriff,
N.A. Wi I lett County Clerk and C.N. Brooks Clerk of the District Court
(Reese 1961:134). Four county commissioners were also named, but one
of these and C.N. Brooks refused to serve as Federal appointees and
were replaced.
The appointed officials apparently served the county wel I and
supervised an election held on June 25, 1866, which put three county
commissioners back in the off ices they held under the Confederacy.
Other ex-rebels were elected al I over the state and it seemed that
Reconstruction was at an end.
6-21

HISTORIC PERIOD
The hope of an end to Federal authority was short I ived.
The
newly elected Governor Throckmorton of Texas was removed from off ice
in July 1867, and Edmund J. Davis appointed in his place.
Between
February and July of 1860, al I of the elected officials of Hi I I County
were removed from off ice and replaced with Republican appointees by
General Reynolds (Reese 1961:135). He did not appoint the moderate
Unionists that had been picked by Governor Hami I ton just after the
War, but men who could be termed "carpetbaggers". David C. Wornel was
the sole exception to this rule. He was again appointed sheriff but
only served two months before being removed.
The carpetbagger faction, Evan Beauchamp, John
A. Purnel I,
C.L. Booth and R.R. Booth held al I the major county offices from July,
1869, unti I late in 1871 and some of them remained in office until
1873 (Reese 1961:137). Even the District Judge, F.P. Woods, a Federal
appointee and loyal Republican, was appal led at the conduct of these
men.
He wrote to Governor E.J. Davis on November 7, 1870, that they
"brought contempt on the execution of the law and a reproach on the
party" (Texas State Archives ms. Executive Record Book 78. A. p. 79).
Three days later, he wrote another letter saying that they only
enforced the law when a fine or a fee could be collected, letting
thieves and murderers go free and fai I ing even to maintain basic order
1n the community.
Judge Wood ordered a Grand Jury investigation of the activities
of Sheriff Beauchamp and his removal from office was based on the
investigation. Beauchamp was subsequently charged with theft of
county funds and fled the state. John Purnel I was also judicially
removed from off ice, but the reports of lawlessness had already caused
Governor Davis to threaten martial law.
The Gathings Incident and Martial Law
On the day after Christmas in 1870, a black man and his wife were
ki I led in Bosque County. A coroners jury imp I icated James Gathings,
the son of Hi I I County's leading citizen.
Another man, Sol lol la
Nicholson was also charged. Lt. W.T. Pritchett of the State Pol ice
left the inquest fol lowing a rumor that the men had fled to Covington.
He was not armed with a search warrant.
The Dai Iy Journa I, an Austin newspaper, (February 10, 1871)
quotes Colonel J.J. Gathings as tel I ing Pritchett, "You cannot search
my house with your damned Negro police." Pritchett searched the house
anyway and, not finding his quarry, continued the search in the
Covington area. Meanwhile, perhaps a dozen men gathered at the
Gathings home, angered by the search. One man rode off to find a
Justice of the Peace, the rest ambushed Pritchett and his five pol ice.
Some two hours afterwards the Justice of the Peace arrived with a

The entire party then rode off to Hi I lsboro to a hearing.

official.

At the conclusion of the hearing the State Police were released,
then
re-arrested
shortly afterwards.
Lt. Pritchett was almost
arrested a third time, but managed to escape over the county I ine and
make his way back to Austin. There he reported his troubles to the
State Pol ice Chief, Adjutant General James
Davidson.
Shortly
afterwards Governor E.J. Davis issued a proclamation of Martial Law in
Hi I I County (Texas State Archives ms. Executive Record Book:248, 356).
Davidson and a detachment of 50 State Police came to Hi II County
and arrested J.J. Gathings, his son, his brother Phillip and several
other men (Reese 1961:142). Davidson held the hearings and, with no
lawyers present, imposed a fine of $3,000, the estimated cost of the
two day occupation of the county by State Pol ice. When J.J. Gathings
managed to raise $2,765 of the fine, he and the other prisoners were
released and the Adjutant General returned to Austin. The Fourteenth
"Redeemer" Legislature passed a special bi I I repaying Gathings> fine
with interest; the same body abolished the State Pol ice.
Outlawry
Perhaps because the State Pol ice were so roundly hated by the
general pub I ic, hardened criminals who evaded arrest became folk heros
of a sort. The account of the beginning of John Wesley Hardin's
career from El I is Bailey's book is a case in point:

he shot the Negro, ki I ling him instantly.
John's
father advised him to go to Hi I I County and stay with some
relatives unti I the matter was settled.
This was not
satisfactory with the carpetbaggers.
A squad of Negro
Pol ice under a carpetbagger fol lowed or trailed John across
the Brazos River. It is reported they disappeared (Bailey
1966:118).
John Wesley Hardin came to Hi I I County in 1869 where he bought
and sold cotton and cattle hides, gambled and spent a great deal of
time at the race track (owned by Mr. Boles) near Towash. In December,
1869, he ki I led Jim Bradley, his fifth victime, after a card game
argument. A citizen's posse was formed to catch Hardin, but he
escaped.
Hardin ki I led some 30 men before he was gunned down in El
Paso in 1895. In the interim, he served a long prison term for
ki I I ing a lawman.
He studied law and was admitted to the bar after
leaving prison.

was shot and ki I led in 1869 while attempting to arrest some horse

Economy
If the county was in a state of lawless chaos, it was also
prospering. In 1860 the county produced 3,407 bales of cotton, nearly
a bale for every two residents. Corn was also a major money crop.
However, one of the greatest obstacles to real economic prosperity was
the difficulty of getting these agricultural products to market.
During the Reconstruction era goods had to be transported to Mil I ican
in Brazos County by wagon over very primitive roads. At the Mi I I ican

farmers, the cotton growers of Hi I I County saw the rai I roads as a
cheap means of transporting their produce to market at the same time
that they brought in finished goods that could be sold more cheaply.
A piano that traveled by wagon from any distance could be extremely
costly. Conversely, cartage could eat away the total value of a bale
of cotton if it had to travel very far and prices were not up. New
towns were bui It along the right-of-way and old townsites were
abandoned as houses, stores and even cotton gins were moved closely to
the rai I road. Seven rai I roads were bui It between 1879 and 1905.

that Patton took any active part in the political life of the county.
The only pub I ic off ice he ever held, that of postmaster, was under the

Whitney, another rai I road town, was named for Charles A. Whitney,
a large stockholder in the Texas Central Rai I road. The town was laid

mercantile establishments of the two postmasters.

inspector arrived the two men had already consolidated the two post
off ices to serve the new town.
Whitney took a number of houses and businesses from the Towash
settlement. The old Dyer mi I I discussed earlier continued to function
unti I it was destroyed by flood waters in 1902. The vi I Iage of some
15 businesses in 1879 did not survive the flood nor the rai I road town.
When the townsite was covered by the waters of Lake Whitney, only the
century old Towash Baptist Church was stil I functioning as a community
institution. Even the citizens of Peoria, which had once been a
leading community 1n the county, lost their newspaper to the new
rai I road town.
Abbott - Liberty Grove
In 1882, when the rai I I ine connecting Hi I lsboro and Waco was
bui It, the town of Abbott was laid out a few miles south of Hi I lsboro.
The town was named for Congressman Joe Abbott of Hi I I County (Bailey
1966:228). The Baptist Church of Liberty Grove and the Blooming Grove
Community School were moved to the new town. Three devastating fires
almost wiped out the town.
The ruins of these earlier burned
structures are on the west side of the rai I road grade.
The existing
town was rebui It on the east side of the tracks. The town was
officially incorporated in 1916. El I is Bailey (1966:228-229) gives an
extensive I ist of the former residents and the names of the owners of
various businesses in the town.
Blum
When the Santa Fe Rai I road bui It a spur northward into Fort Worth
1n 1881, a station was required in the Nolan River valley. A town was
laid out and cal led Blum. According to Bailey (1966:166) the town was
named for Leo Blum; why he was so honored is not stated. At one time
Blum (the town) had its own Farmers State Bank which did business for
30 years before fal I ing victim to the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Itasca
Another town laid out in 1881 was Itasca.
The town, which is
eight miles north of the site of old Fort Smith and the Turner house,
was not surveyed and designated a town site until the rai I road was
bui It.
The group of families living around the Turner house very
likely formed the earliest community in Hi I I County, but no actual
survey into town lots was undertaken. The name of Itasca was coined
by the survey crew because of the standing water that covered the site
after a heavy rain. "Itasca was named after a damyankee lake" (Bailey
1966:191); Lake Itasca is the headwaters of the Mississippi River.

HISTORIC PERIOD
With very I ittle to recommend it other than level lots and
prairie grass, the I ittle town flourished. An extensive catalog of
the businesses and residents of the town can be found in Bailey
(1966:191-202).
James Verdo Reese, whose manuscript has been used as
a primary source on the early history of the county, was born 1n
Itasca in 1934.
Hubbard - Mt. Calm - Mclainsboro
When the Cotton Belt Rai I road was bui It through Hil I County in
1881, the town of Hubbard was organized. By 1895, Hubbard had a bank
and was an incorporated community. There had been a country store at
the
site for some years before and a smal I community cal led
Mclainsboro. The people of Mclainsboro and Mt. Calm attempted to
negotiate with the Cotton Belt Rai I road and locate a new town about
three miles east of Mt. Calm. The Rai I road's interest in selling lots
prevailed and the town of Hubbard came into being (Bailey 1966:156).

In 1902, the T & BV (Bol I Weevi I) Rai I road intersected the I & GN
I ine at a place on the Wal I ing farm. They started a rival town,
cal I ing it Malone in honor of a company official (Bailey 1966:230).
The I & GN refused to stop at Malone so A.D. Wal ling took them to
court and won. When two stations were bui It in Malone the town of
Wal I ing was doomed.
The Post Office in Wal I ing was closed in the
mid-1920s after the rai I road station was torn down.
Ironically,
Wal I ing had done away with the two Wal lings, both named in his honor.
Malone, however, survives.
Irene
The town of Irene is another of the late rai I road towns. It was
laid out in 1902 along the route of the I & GN. By 1907, the town had
a bank. The community experienced slow but steady growth unti I a
combination of the Great Depression and a tornado in May, 1930, badly
damaged the town. Like many rural Texas towns that were thriving
communities in the 1920s, Irene has not successfully competed in the
era of easy road transport.

HISTORIC PERIOD
Penelope - Zee Vee
Another of the late rai I road towns in Hi I I County, Penelope, was
surveyed about 1903 along the route of the I & BH Rai I road. The town
of Zee Vee that had existed in the area was moved to the new townsite.
The old townsite was converted into a cemetery (Bailey 1966:229).
Bynum
Bynum is the newest of the rai I road towns bui It in Hi I I County.
It was laid out when the T & BV (Bol I Weevi I) Rai I road was bui It in
1904. A grocery and a drugstore were moved to the new site from an
earlier nearby townsite now cal led Old Bynum.
A fire in 1925
destroyed most of the business section of this town. Those structures
that were rebui It were damaged and several people killed by a tornado
in 1930.
These disasters, the Great Depression, and easy road
transport combined to stop any significant growth. In 1960, the bank
and seven other businesses were recorded along with a population of
270 (Dal las Morning News 1963:141).
Road and Bridge Development
During the first quarter of the twentieth century the building of
county roads and the erection of bridges across the many creeks made
it much easier for the isolated farmer to trade in the larger towns.
In many ways the ease and speed of transportation, a product of both
the automobile and the improved transportation network, made the
eventual fate of the smaller farming hamlets one of stasis and
decline. Three smal I steel truss bridges sti I I spanned Aqui I la Creek
within the flood pool area at the time of the project. These were
recorded and evaluated and the information is presented in Chapter 20.
Summary
Hi I I County reached its population peak in the census of 1910
with a population of 46,760. The boom of rai I road town building and a
Fifty years
period of good cotton prices contributed to this peak.
later about half that number were counted (Dal las Morning News
1963:119). Throughout the last part of the nineteenth century and--up
unti I the Great Depression of the 1930s, Hi I I County remained a cash
crop economy with cotton and corn as the leading produce.
URBANIZATION
After reaching the 1910 peak, the story of the rest of the
twentieth century is one of declining population. As shown in Figure
6.3, the county as a whole showed a steady and increasing rate of
6-29

HISTORIC PERIOD
population loss;
the city of Hi I lsboro experienced a modest growth
unti I 1960. As one might expect, the median age of the population
rose to 40.0 years by 1960 (Dal las Morning New 1963:131). The
overwhelming majority of these people were native born whites;
only
3,665 blacks lived 1n Hi I I County in 1960.
The 1950-1960 decade saw the trend of rural population loss
accelerate.
Twenty-nine percent fewer people I ived in rural Hi I I
County in 1960 than lived there ten years earlier.
The small towns
that had struggled through the Great Depression and the growth of the
great highway systems that bypassed themJ clung to I ife (Table 6.1).
In most cases the railroad depot was closed and in some cases the very
track that brought the town into being had been torn up. Other towns
that grew up around a mi I I, a doctor's house or a storeJ even without
a rai I road, such as Vaughn, Osceola and Brandon, sti I I exist.

RESEARCH DESIGN

David 0. Brown and Richard P. Watson

RESEARCH GOALS
As befits a large, complex, multi-stage archeological project
such as the excavations at Aqui I la Lake, there has been considerable
change in project orientation and evolution of the project research
goals.
This has somewhat inhibited the achievement of al I intended
goals, but has also had the beneficial effect of broadening the
project horizons.
In the final analysis, some attempt has been made
to answer in part the questions raised below.
Generally, field and
laboratory methods were geared towards providing data applicable to
these goals.
Seven research goals were formulated to aid in data recovery
during the TAS 1980 field season. The first two goals evaluate the
cultural and chronological framework of the area along with the
adaptive strategies used by the inhabitants. Where possible, these
strategies are related to those of surrounding cultural areas.
The
third goal, formulated to reflect the major emphasis of the 1978
investigations, is to evaluate previous settlement models proposed for
the Aqui I la area. The remaining four goals were developed fol lowing
suggestions set forth by the Corps of Engineers in the project scope
of work (Appendix II).
These goals include to identify changes in
I ithic technology through time, to identity and evaluate any evidence
of contact and/or exchange with areas outside the Central Brazos
region, evaluate surficial and/or disturbed sites, and the development
and evaluation of procedures useful in maximizing data recovery from
surf icial and/or disturbed areas.

7-1

RESEARCH DESIGN
1) TO EVALUATE THE BASIC CULTURAL
PROPOSED FOR THE AQUILLA LAKE AREA.

AND

CHRONOLOGICAL

FRAMEWORK

The cultural chronological framework for Central Texas has
recently been restated (Prewitt 1981), and remains a good model to be
tested throughout the various sub-regions of Central Texas.
The
limits of various archeological cultures may have varied extensively
through time, as is suggested by Gunn and Prewitt (1984), and the
dating of a particular archeological phenomenon, such as a specific
projectile point style or a site type, may vary throughout the whole
of the area.
In Chapter 5 of this report, Prewitt>s Central Texas chronology
scheme is presented superimposed upon the earlier frameworks proposed
by Suhm, Krieger and Jelks (1954) and Weir (1976).
Skinner et al.
(1978:179-80) have previously presented a chronological scheme for the
Aqui I la area that incorporates several typical Central Brazos "key
index marker" projectile points into an earlier formulation of the
Prewitt model (Prewitt 1974b). Neither of these models has yet been
tested with hard data from the Aquil la area.
Testing a chronological model ultimately needs deep stratified
sites with materials suitable for radiometric dating, and recognizable
artifact styles which can be compared between sites and between
regions.
The paucity of excavations at stratified sites in the
Aqui I la Lake area is a major stumbling block in effecting such a test.
For this reason, one of the primary goals of the last season of field
work was the excavation of a deep stratigraphic column at the McDonald
Site, where stratified deposits were known to exist. This 2 meter
square by 4 meter deep sampling unit is too smal I to extrapolate to an
entire region, but provides some useful information, as do the few
other sites with radiocarbon dates in the lake area.
Al I of these
sites are included in the floodplain section of this report.
In addition to the few radiocarbon dates and artifact types
recovered from reasonably good subsurface context, a large quantity of
recognizable artifact types, almost exclusively projectile points,
exists from the surface and disturbed sites in the lake area. The
form and quantity of these specimens are clues to the relationship of
the Aqui I la Lake cultural sequence to that of nearby areas such as
Central Texas. Among the concluding sections, the chapter on culture
history provides a preliminary assessment of this model. A summary of
this assessment is provided in the final chapter.

7-2

RESEARCH DESIGN
2) TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES IN THE AQUILLA LAKE
AREA AND TO EXAMINE, IF POSSIBLE, THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE STRATEGIES
TO THOSE OF SURROUNDING AREAS.
This research goal encompasses a number of related issues which
surround the adaptive strategies of the prehistoric inhabitants of the
area. These include particular economic adaptations and the size and
location of the territories exploited.
Several models have been
proposed for such strategies in previous Aqui I la Lake archeological
research (Skinner and Henderson 1972; Lynott and Peter 1977; Skinner
et al. 1978; Skinner et al. ms.). Skinner and Henderson (1972:56-7),
for instance, proposed that the Aqui I la Creek area was uti I ized for
specific maintenance activities by groups ranging from more permanent
base camps in the Brazos River Valley. Lynott and Peter (1977:18)
pointed out that the largest sites were located on Aqui I la Creek
rather
than the Brazos River, suggesting a somewhat different
settlement pattern. Skinner et al. (1978), in reporting their work in
the area, reconstruct the hypothetical size and location of group
territories during the Prehistoric Period.
They also provide a
preliminary catchment analysis of the Brazi I Site (41HI75), suggesting
the potential resources avai I able to local groups.
Although the testing of such adaptive strategies is difficult,
the data gathered during the last seasons of the project have been
assessed in terms of the ability to shed further light on area
adaptations.
The chapter evaluating the 1978 catchment analysis
utilizes fauna I materials recovered from the McDonald Site. While the
material from a single site 1s necessarily limited in understanding
the economic strategies of a region, it does provide a first
approximation.
The question of territorial range 1s much more difficult.
Comparative analysis of artifactual material, both within and without
the reservoir area, can afford some idea of the direction and outer
I imits of the size of prehistoric group ranges. The chapter on the
culture historical framework discusses the distribution of artifact
styles and culture areas in the region. This serves as a backdrop for
a more specific discussion of ranges and adaptive strategies 1n the
concluding chapter.
3) TO EVALUATE PREVIOUS SETTLEMENT PATTERN MODELS PROPOSED
THE AQUILLA LAKE AREA.

FOR

The SMU 1978 investigations focused almost exclusively on the
definition and evaluation of settlement models. Two models have been
proposed: a Restricted Wandering Model and a Central Based Wandering
Model.
Both are based on the generalized settlement subsistence
models proposed by Beardsley et al. (1956).

7-3

RESEARCH DESIGN

The Restricted Wandering Model, as applied to
area by Lynott and Peter (1977), is described as:

the

Aquil la

Lake

Restricted Wandering as it originally was defined (Beardsley
et al. 1956:136-138) may be the erratic movement of people
within a territory or patterned seasonal movement within a
territory. The population density is expected to be low and
to consist of a band of nuclear or extended families, and
subsistence is expected to be based upon hunting and
gathering (Lynott and Peter 1977:23).
The Central Based Wandering Model favored by Skinner (Skinner and
Henderson 1972; Skinner et al. 1978, ms.) views the Aqui I la sites in
terms of a hierarchy whereby the largest sites, greater than 20,000
square meters, are assumed to have functioned as base camps, while the
smaller sites are defined as special use sites, such as mussel
gathering camps, creekside hunting and/or gathering camps and quarry
sites.
The analysis of prehistoric settlement requires that sites be
located
relative to their environment and each other, and be
differentiated according to their function.
Previous research has
addressed these issues theoretically within the confines of larger
subsistence models, but has failed to account for
alternative
explanations that might have resulted in the observed patterns. These
alternative explanations could include multiple occupations, proximity
to valued resources and duration of occupation. However, Gallagher
(1978:296-300) noted that implementation of the research design,
intended to evaluate the model, was not carried out in a consistent
manner. A discussion of how the recent investigations bear on the
previously proposed subsistence models wi II be presented in Chapter 43
of this report.

4) TO IDENTIFY CHANGES THROUGH TIME IN THE LITHIC TECHNOLOGY
THE AQUILLA LAKE AREA.

OF

Previous research projects in the Aqui I la lake area suggested the
possibi I ity of changes through time in the lithic technology (Lynott
and Peter 1977). In order to obtain the necessary temporal control,
single components and/or wel I stratified sites should be investigated.
The I ithic categories uti I ized here and the characteristics recorded
for specimens from each category reflect those aspects of lithic
technology which seem to have the broadest applicability.
These
technological aspects, described in Chapter 9, are general, but what
7-4

RESEARCH DESIGN
they lack in specificity is made up for in the feasibility of
system hand I ing the analysis of thousands of specimens.
5) TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE EVIDENCE FOR CONTACT
WITH AREAS OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL BRAZOS RIVER REGION.

EXCHANGE

Contact between the Caddoan region of East Texas and the Central
Brazos region has been documented for the Lat~ Prehistoric Period
(Jelks 1961, 1962; Watt 1941, 1953). The nature of these contacts,
however, has not been determined nor have contacts with other areas
and from earlier periods been investigated.
The Aqui I la Lake area, on the fringe of Central Texas, is seen as
a transitional region where archeological remains may reflect contact
between bands representing widely differing adaptations or cultural
traditions.
In addition, the north-south trending Aqui I la Creek
drainage may have been an important route between Central and North

suggest the nature and extent of such cultural contact.
Stylistic
variations are discussed to some extent in Chapter 44, which outlines
the culture history of the project area. Also, a comparison of the
rock hearths encountered in the project area with features in other
areas, indicates contact and exchange with Central Texas, where such
hearths are common and almost no contact with East Texas, where such
features are rare.
The mussel she I I features show contact and
exchange with cultures uti I izing riverine environments.
6) TO EVALUATE SURFICIAL REMAINS FROM DISTURBED AND ERODED SITES
AS INDICATORS OF PREHISTORIC ACTIVITIES.
A high percentage of the sites in the Aqui I la drainage and the
entire Central Brazos region have been subject to post-depositional
disturbances, ranging from agricultural activities to deflation and
severe erosion.
The informational content of these sites is best
interpreted in light of an evaluation of the specific impacts
affecting each site. Toward this goal, the various impacts and their
effects on the site content were evaluated for each site.
By noting
the topographic position, soi Is and evidence of past agricultural
activities, these impacts could be defined and their effects assessed.
The evaluation of materials concentrated on technological and
morphological
characteristics which

7)

As noted above, the frequency of disturbed or surf icial sites in
the Aqui I la Lake area has made the isolation of separate site
components a difficult task. In an attempt to use materials from
these sites in the interpretation of the cultural history of the area,
several different methods of surface collections were undertaken and a
preliminary evaluation of the results made. The surface collection
methods uti Ii zed, which included both spatially stratified and
naturally defined sampling procedures, are described in Chapter 8 and
are briefly assessed in Chapter 48.
8) TO DEVELOP A PRELIMINARY REGIONAL
CENTRAL BRAZOS REGION.

RESEARCH

DESIGN FOR THE

In addition to those goals addressed specifically through field
investigations, this eighth goal, the development and preliminary
evaluation of a regional research design for the Central Brazos
drainage, is incorporated into this report. This goal, addressed in
the last volume, is patterned on the research designs proposed by
House and Schiffer (1975:163-186) for the Cache River Basin of Eastern
Arkansas and the recently developed Texas RP3 model (Brown et
al. 1982).
The development of a regional research design was a
primary focus of the doctoral dissertation by Watson (1982) and
Chapter 45 is a modified version of that design. Supplementary
research design models by Brown and Jackson have been added for the
present report.

DATA COLLECTION

Richard P. Watson and David 0. Brown

The investigations reported here comprise the final three seasons
of archeological work at Aqui I la Lake as undertaken by three different
field archeologists from two
different
research
laboratories.
Understandably, there has been considerable variation in research
orientation and investigative method during this work. The 1978 field
season at Aqui I la Lake, conducted by SMU, is regarded as the final
season of the testing phase, while the 1980 and 1982 field seasons by
TAS comprise the mitigation phase. The 24 sites discussed in this
report vary widely in the intensity of investigation, ranging from
I imited testing to extensive excavations. Correspondingly, the amount
of work conducted at any site varied widely, ranging from surface
collection to excavation of a contiguous block of units.
The fol lowing section summarizes the general methods of data
collection used during the final phases of the project. Data recovery
More
methods are divided into surface collection and excavation.
detailed information on methods can be found in the individual site
descriptions.
SURFACE COLLECTION
Control led, intensive surface collection was uti Ii zed only during
the 1980 and 1982 investigations by TAS.
A surface collection
subsequent to intentional plowing had been planned for one site,
41HI75 (the Brazi I Site), during the 1978 SMU investigations but was
not completed (see chapter on the Brazil Site in this report).
Several different strategies of surface collection were employed,
the choice of method depending on the density and distribution of
artifacts at a particular site. During the 1980 season, systematic
surface collection was undertaken at two sites, 41HI76 and 41HI74.
The same procedures were fol lowed at both.
Prior to beginning any
8-1

DATA COLLECTION
surface collection, an informal survey of each site was conducted
the
notes
and
reports
of
SMU
which, in conjunction with
investigations, al lowed definition of the site limits. Once the
limits were defined, the entire site was spatially stratified into 20
by 20 meter units.
Within each of these sampling units a single 4
meter diameter collection circle (area=12.57 square meters) was
randomly placed.
The position of the collection units was defined
from the intersection of two randomly determined axes numbered from 1
to 20 along the north and west sides of each 20 by 20 meter sampling
unit.
After each collection unit was placed, it was cleared of
vegetation by cutting and raking, care being taken not to disturb the
ground surface any more than was necessary. Al I materials exposed on
the surface were then collected and bagged. Those units which fel I in
highly disturbed areas, or 1n areas where the clearing of dense
vegetation would have been prohibitive, were not established or
collected.
On several sites with dense surface vegetation cover, plowing and
subsequent surface collection were uti I ized to obtain a sample of
artifacts. Al I of the sites investigated in this manner were thought
to have been previously disturbed on the surface by clearing and/or
plowing. This method was used only during the 1980 season of
investigation.
Sites 41HI107 and 41HI108 were plowed in their entirety using a
buster plow.
This plow, mounted behind a smal I tractor, produced
three furrows, two complete beds (ridges) and half of two others. The
plow cut shallow furrows 1 to 6 inches deep, and had a tendency to
ride up out of the ground due to the heavy weed cover.
The plowed
strips were approximately 6 feet wide, of which only half was ti I led.
On site 41HI106, 11 strips were plowed at 15 meter intervals
across the field in which the site was located. Each furrow was then
surface collected in an attempt to more accurately define the I imits
of the site, and if possible, to characterize the archeological
assemblage. At both 41HI106 and 41HI107 al I artifacts exposed by the
plowing were plotted as to bearing, elevation and distance from an
arbitrarily defined station at each site. No material was recovered
from 41HI108.
On the sites where gridded, systematic surface
collection
techniques
were
uti Ii zed,
exposure
of artifacts was due to
disturbances such as plowing and rodent activities, which 1n both
cases was distributed across much of the site. In such cases, a
systematic collection should provide a generally representative sample
of the distribution of materials across the site. At other sites,
8-2

DATA COLLECTION
where surface exposure 1s a result of less evenly distributed
processes, obtaining a sample that is representative of the areal
distribution of materials is difficult or impossible.
A site with
unevenly distributed erosional gul I ies is an excel lent example of
this. The hi I I side sites (41HI109, 41Hl110 and 41Hllll), south of the
McDonald Site (41HI105) and the hi I I slope base site (41HI112) south of
the Bailey Site (41HI77), are sites where the surface distribution of
materials was not thought to be representative.
During the 1980 investigations, these sites (41HI109, 41HI110,
41HI111 and 41HI112) were the focus of select, control led collections
where formal tools and a smal I sample of the unmodified materials were
located on a map of the site and collected. A second collection was
made in this manner at 41HI111 during the 1982 season.
Although these collections provided a provenienced sample of the
formal tools found, the time involved in mapping individual artifacts
precluded the acquisition of an adequate, representative sample of
I ithic debitage. Since a comparative look at the I ithic technology of
certain of these sites was thought to be important, particularly those
close to major riverine sites such as the McDonald Site (41HI105),
more extensive collections were made at both 41HI109 and 41HI110
during the 1982 TAS investigations.
The collection technique uti I ized 1n these instances was the
total collection of naturally defined erosional areas where clusters
of lithic debris occurred. In the case of I inear exposures such as
gullies, artificial breaks in the sampling units were made every three
to five meters. The location and approximate size of each area was
plotted on a plane table map of the respective site.
EXCAVATION
Although surface collection can provide
rapid
pre I iminary
assessment of many sites, excavation must ultimately be the source of
the detailed data expected of archeological investigation. Given the
proper
interpretation
of
stratigraphy
and
post-depositional
disturbances, excavation is generally the best method of obtaining
temporal
sequences of cultural change as wel I as horizontally
patterned site activity data. As might be expected, al I but three of
the 24 sites investigated included excavation techniques of one sort
or another, ranging from a single shovel test to large contiguous
horizontal excavation blocks.
During the 1978 season, a variety of different excavation methods
were used to determine the nature of subsurface deposits. Depending
upon the extent of previous knowledge of the site and the expectations
8-3

DATA COLLECTION
of its research potential, methods ranging from shovel testing to
extensive control led excavations. In two cases, 41HI75 and 41HI105,
backhoe trenches were used as an aid to examining the stratigraphy.
Shovel tests were conducted on four sites during 1978, 41HI75
(the Brazi I Site), 41Hl122, 41Hl123 and 41Hll25.
At 41Hl75 and
41HI125, shovel tests were utilized in conjunction with
other
excavation methods while at 41HI122 and 41HI123 shovel testing proved
adequate to determine the disturbed and/or surf icial nature of the
cultural deposits. Shovel tests to determine the subsurface extent of
cultural materials (ranging from 23 at 41HI75 to 107 at 41HI125) were
located at regular grid intervals (10 meter intervals at al I sites but
41HI125 where the interval was 5 meters) Al I of the tests were
excavated to a depth of 40 centimeters. At each site, shovel test
locations are shown on the site map.
The effectiveness of shovel
testing as a rapid investigative technique is discussed in Chapter 34
on 41HI125.
Control led excavations were conducted at five sites during the
1978 SMU investigations, 41HI58 (the Reps Davis Site), 41HI75 (the
Brazi I Site), 41HI105 (the McDonald Site), 41HI124 (the Pilgrim Site)
and 41HI125.
Various combinations of the 1 by 1 and 2 by 2 meter
units dug in 5 and 10 centimeter levels were uti I ized. Three of the
excavated sites
41HI58, 41HI75 and 41HI124 - had been previously
tested and this information was used to help place the 1978 tests.
The exception is the Brazi I Site where previous information was
supplemented by shovel testing, plowing and backhoe trenching to
assist in the location of the units. At one of the remaining two
sites, 41HI125, the 1 meter square test units were superimposed over
the shovel test grid at regularly spaced intervals. At the McDonald
Site, excavation units were set on 10 meter grid intervals off of an
initial 1 by 5 meter unit.
During the TAS 1980 season, excavations were conducted at five
sites (41HI76, 41HI77, 41HI104, 41HI105 and 41HI74/114), and shovel
tests were made at three others (41Hl109, 41HI110 and 41HI112).
Excavation procedures varied with the intent of the investigations.
For those sites where systematic surface collections had been made,
41HI76 and 41Hl74/114, 1 by 1 meter test pits were excavated to
determine the present condition of the archeological deposits and to
locate any intact features and stratified deposits. In two cases,
test pits were expanded to more fully expose features.
Al I test pits at 41HI76 and 41HI74/114 were oriented to the
north-south, east-west grid established for the systematic surface
collection of these sites. At 41HI76, six test pits were located such
that their northwest corner coincided with the center of a previously
selected surface collection unit. The location of the test pits was

not randomly determined.
Rather, areas which showed the greatest
potential for the determination of disturbance factors and intact
deposits were specifically selected. At both 41HI105 and 41HI77, the
1980 excavations were tied into the previously established SMU grid
system which, in both cases, was not set up on a north-south
orientation. At the Bailey Site (41HI77), the SMU grid is oriented 25
degrees west of north, while at the McDonald Site (41HI105), the
original grid was oriented 21 degrees east of north.
At the Bailey
Site the two units were simply designated units A and B, while at the
McDonald Site a point near the initial 2 by 2 meter excavation unit
was designated as NSOO/WSOO and subsequent units numbered relative to
this.
Shovel tests were conducted at three sites during the 1980
investigations, 41HI109, 41HI110 and 41HI112.
These sites, which
included only one test at 41HI112 and two each at 41HI109 and 41HI110,
were strategically located so that they might give a preliminary idea
of the depth, thickness and integrity of the archeological deposits.
Al I f i I I from these units was screened through 1/4 inch mesh and,
where possible, the depth of artifactual materials was recorded.
During the 1982 TAS work at Aqui I la Lake, a combination of
excavation
techniques,
again
including both shovel tests and
control led excavation units, was uti Ii zed.
Backhoe trenching was
employed to examine the stratigraphy at five sites, 41HI105 (the
McDonald Site), 41HI109, 41HI110, 41HI116 and 41HI117 (the Sul Ii van
Site).
In addition to the trenching, a backhoe was used to strip
sterile sediments from the surface of two sites (McDonald and
McKenzie)
to faci I itate control led excavation of deeply buried
cultural deposits.
Two by two meter excavation units were located on five of the
sites investigated during the 1982 season, 41Hl103, 41HI105, 41HI109,
41HI110 and 41HI117. On the latter four, these units were excavated
in 10 centimeter levels, with depths ranging from 40 centimeters at
41HI109 to 4 meters at the McDonald Site. Wider horizontal excavation
areas, composed of contiguous one meter square units, were opened in
areas stripped by backhoe at two sites, the McDonald and McKenzie
sites.
Arbitrary grid systems were established at three of the sites
excavated during the 1982 season. The least extensive of these was at
the Sul Ii van Site (41HI117) where a grid, oriented on magnetic north,
was loosely established to locate the backhoe trenches and numerically
designate the 2 by 2 meter test pits.
Backhoe trenches at the
Sul I ivan Site were located with the aid of a Brunton Compass and paced
distances while excavation units were located with a transit and
alidade. Excavation units were designated by the grid coordinates of
the southwest corner. A point near the first test unit at this site
was designated as N500/W500 and subsequent units numbered relative to
8-5

this point. At the McDonald Site the previously established grid was
reused, while at the McKenzie Site a new grid, oriented with the
direction of the gully and the backhoe stripped area (52 degrees east
of magnetic north), was established.
A point near the southeast
corner of the gridded area at the McKenzie Site was designated N50/W50
and other units designated relative to this.
Shovel tests were uti Ii zed at two sites during the 1982 season,

included three 50 by 50 centimeter shovel tests (in addition to the
three 2 by 2 meter units) excavated in approximate 10 centimeter
levels with excavated matrix hand screened through 1/4 inch mesh
hardware cloth. At 41HI111, fourteen 25 by 25 centimeter shovel tests
were excavated at 5 meter intervals in an area of the site which had
not previously seen any excavations.
These shovel tests were not
screened; excavated matrix in these units was carefully inspected
while being trowel led by hand. In both of these cases the objective
was not only the recovery of cultural material but to obtain a better
look at the cultural and natural stratigraphy near the surface. At
41HI111, where the landform on which the shovel tests were located 1s

Hackberry Creek terrace, excavations were relatively shallow, ranging

easterly (see map in the chapter on the Sul I ivan Site) of the shovel
tests was located in alluvial soi Is of possibly recent origin, shovel
test depths ranged down to 1 meter.
At al I of the sites with controlled excavation units, matrix was
screened through 1/4 inch mesh hardware cloth. During the 1982 work
at the McDonald Site, water screening was added to facilitate
separation of the heavy clays and to improve recovery of more delicate
faunal remains. Unfortunately, it was felt that Hackberry Creek water
was not safe to work in and water screening had to be carried out at
some distance from the site.
Despite this drawback, experiments
during the field season showed that it was sti II faster to transport
the excavated matrix to usable water than to dry screen at the site.
The excavated matrix was transported to the work area behind crew
headquarters in Peoria in gunny sacks labeled with colored flagging
tape. Here it was dumped into large wash tubs where the clay was
soaked 1n plain water. Soaking time varied with the texture of the
soi 1, ranging from a fraction of an hour to as long as overnight. All
samples were then water screened through 1/4 inch mesh using a
gasoline powered water pump set beside a stock tank.
Where clay
content was low, the matrix was initially pre-screened at the site,
i.e., the matrix was tossed on a screen and briefly inspected, then
poured into gunny sacks and recorded as pre-screened. In levels with
higher si It content, this greatly reduced the amount of material to be
transported as wel I as the screening time involved.

DATA COLLECTION

SPECIAL SAMPLES
During al I three seasons various pollen, soi I and matrix samples
were collected from sites being investigated. Flotation samples were
collected from the various levels of the deep excavation unit
(N522/W544) at the McDonald Site.
In addition, special phytol ith
samples were taken from various units at the McDonald Site during the
1980 season.
Only test samples of any of these have been run; the
remaining samples have been prepared for curation at the facilities of
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), The University of
Texas at Austin.

LABORATORY ANALYSIS

LITHIC ANALYSIS
Lithic materials recovered from sites in the Aqui I la Lake area
were
divided
into
four major categories:
debitage, modified
debitage/informal tools, formal tools, and ground and battered stone.
Each of these categories was further subdivided for the purpose of
analysis. A complete discussion of the lithic materials recovered
from each site is presented in the individual site discussions.
Flaked Stone
In order to reduce the hand I ing and multiple sorting and to
increase the f lexibi I ity of the analysis, a system of computer coding
was adopted for analysis of the flakes, chips and modified debitage.
Flakes
and
chips
were analyzed to define prehistoric I ithic
technologies used in the area and delineate technological changes

technological changes through time. The modified debitage analysis
was a means of determining site function and use areas within sites.
This procedure required that the I ithic debitage from each collection
be sorted only once. A series of predetermined variables was recorded
for each specimen. Prior to beginning the coding of the flakes, chips
and modified debitage, a review of the I iterature was made in order to
determine which variables might prove to be the most useful in the
characterization of prehistoric lithic technologies (Henry, Haynes and
Bradley 1976; Mal louf 1976; Odel I 1980; Odel I and Odell-Vereecken
1980;
Tringham et al. 1974).
A preliminary sampling and study of
materials collected during the 1979-80 season also provided clues to
potentially significant variables.
A I ist of definitions used in this report is presented here.
An
attempt has been made to use generally accepted terms and to provide
clarification where the use of a term varies from common usage.

GLOSSARY
Attrition facet: A continuous area of an edge or face which exhibits
attrition resulting from bending, conical fractures or abrasion.
In the analysis of modified debitage the attrition facet often
corresponds
with
what
Knudson (1979:270) has termed the
culturally significant "employable unit" (EU).
An EU is conceptually defined as that segment or portion
(an edge (E), projection (P), facial arris (FA), or facial
surface (FS) of an implement that would
provide
a
continuous work surface without reorienting the entire
implement when that implement 1s used against another
material
to
perform
work (e.g., cutting, scraping,
dri I I ing). The unit is usually identified as that part of
a tool edge bounded by abrupt changes in plan contour, or
the conjunction (projection) itself becomes the point of
work force application.
An EU's identification as a
potentially (but not absolutely) culturally significant
unit (i.e.
"employable" or "usable") is the presence of
deliberate piece or edge thinning flake scars ("retouch")
and/or
apparent
post-production
modification
(edge
spa I I ing 1 striae, abrasion, polish) (Knudson 1979:270).
Bidirectional core: A core from which flakes have
two opposing-directions.

been

struck

from

Bifacial core: A core from which flakes have been removed bifacial ly
from the core edges. This core type is occasionally difficult to
separate from early stage bifaces. The definition used in 1982
includes bifacial edges which are continuous around more than
three-quarters of the piece as actual bifaces. In the case of
chopper tools, however, if use as a tool is obvious, it was
included with bifaces with less finished edge.
~:

Core:

A flake fragment which lacks a striking platform.
Any pebble or cobble from which a flake or flakes have been
intentionally removed (Mal louf 1976:152).
Ideally, one could
separate between cores which functioned only to provide flake
blanks for the production of tools and cobbles which were
intended to serve as blanks for bifaces but were rejected at a
very early stage of manufacture.
In practice, however, this
distinction is nearly impossible and many early stage bifaces may
be counted as cores. See bifacial cores.

abandoned after removal of only one or two flakes. Though
occasionally difficult to separate from non-cultural debris,
these specimens provide important data on the raw material
selection process.

heat, intentionally or unintentionally, to lithic materials. For
the purposes of this study only those materials which exhibit

UNMODIFIED DEBITAGE
Flakes
The analysis of I ithic flakes was conducted in order to define
the prehistoric lithic technologies which were uti I ized in the Aqui I la
area and in an attempt to delineate changes 1n these technologies
through time.
As already noted, a system of computer coding was adopted for the
analysis
of
the
flakes.
Five
variables (3 nominal and 2
presence-absence) were recorded for every flake, along with the
relevant provenience information.
As each flake was inspected, the
appropriate values of these variables were recorded on an Opscan
Data-Ref lex, General Coding Form, using a penci I to blank the
numerical codes. Once completed, these forms were machine read and
transferred to file tapes on The University of Texas at Austin CDC
computer system.
During the sorting and coding process al I chips, cores, tools and
tool fragments, and al I specimens exhibiting any evidence of Type 1 or
Type 2 attrition were separated for further analysis.
The following
variables were recorded for every flake in the collections.
NOMINAL VARIABLES
Flake Type: This variable describes the relative percentage of
cortex present on the dorsal surface of the flake. The frequency and
distribution of flake types can provide useful information on the
nature of the I ithic technology on a given site and when compared
across various sites and/or strata can help to define changes in these
technologies through time.

MATERIAL: Six gross categories of I ithic material were used to
describe the flakes for this analysis.

In a replicative
experiment, Henry, Haynes and Bradley (1976) found that 19.6% of the
soft hammer flake assemblage was I ipped, while only 1.3% of the hard
hammer flakes had lips. The relative frequency of I ipped flakes may
therefore be an indicator of the presence of a soft hammer technology

PROBLEMS
In theory, this is an excel lent suite of variables for the rapid
encoding of flake data, and ultimately useful in determining the gross
characteristics of a large population of debitage.
In practice,
however, several problems were noted during the analysis which should
be mentioned here. These difficulties and others are assessed in
greater detai I in Chapter 34. The first, third and last of the above
mentioned variables
are
unquestionably
objective
and
easily
rep I icable.
The most easily resolved problem resulted from a mix up
in lab analysis instructions over the three seasons of analysis
primary flakes were identified without consideration of platform type
in the SMU analysis and during a portion of the 1982 season. The 1982
misidentif ications were easily resorted by computer, but the SMU
figures have not been changed except where their data has been
included in the overal I I ithic analysis in the concluding chapters.
This results in an inflation of the actual number of primary flakes
and a slight (but probably insignificant overal I) reduction in the
number of secondary flakes in the SMU chapters.
Thermal alteration was easily recognizable as potl ids or crazing,
but a large number of obviously burned material was rejected because
it did not conform to either of these objective, but rigid criteria.
Inclusion of these specimens, however, would have made the analysis
much more dependent upon the experience of the individual analyst in
recogn1z1ng burned materials.
Few problems were encountered with
material type identification with the occasional exception of making
the distinction between coarse grained chert and various fine grained
quartzites such as Potter's chert. At this point the mineralogical
distinction may be less important than the isotropic qua I ities of the
stone, but the mineralogical distinction was retained since making the
latter a criterion would have placed too great a subjective emphasis
in the analysis.
Chips
Only
Chips are defined as flake fragments which lack platforms.
two variables, in addition to provenience information, were recorded
for the chips in this analysis: material and thermal alteration. The
same values as those used for flakes were used in the analysis of the
chips. A discussion of the patterning of these variables and their
implications for the interpretation of the various sites is presented
with the analysis of each site.

Cores, those pebbles and cobbles from which

of the pattern 1n which flakes were removed:

Four
measurements were recorded for each specimen: weight to the nearest
0.1 grams, and length, width and thickness to the nearest mi I I imeter.
The material and type of platform preparation were recorded using the
same categories as for flakes. The presence or absence of battering
was recorded.
The analysis of cores can be useful in the definition of changes
in lithic technologies through time. Al I cores from the Aquil la area
represent freehand percussion.
Potentially significant variations

MODIFIED DEBITAGE/INFORMAL TOOLS
Modified debitage, as was noted above, is defined as any flake,
chip or core which shows an area of edge attrition visible to the
naked eye or under low powered magnification (14x). Attrition, as it
is used here, need not imply intentional modification or use. Two
types of non-random attrition were identified on the debitage from the
Aqui I la Lake area.
Type 1 Attrition
This type of attrition consists of smal I regular flake scars
along a continuous section (attrition facet) of a flake, chip or core
edge. These scars are usually about as long as they are wide and do
not exhibit obvious bu I bar scars (Fig. 9.1). Using the nomenclature
proposed by Cotterel I et al. (1979), Type 1 attrition ts classified
as
generally
exhibiting
a
bending initiation and a feather
termination. This type of attrition is often defined as use-wear
(Mal louf 1976).
Type 2 Attrition
Type 2 attrition consists of a regular series off lake scars that
are somewhat larger than Type 1 and which also occur along a
continuous section (attrition facet) of a flake, chip or core edge.
Relative to Type 1 attrition, Type 2 shows scars with a more obvious
negative bulb and which tend to be longer relative to their width than
Type
1 (Fig. 9.1).
The Cotterell et al.
(1979) nomenclature
describes this type as cone initiation and feather termination.
Mal louf (1976) and others have described this type as retouch.

The definition of modified debitage is based on the assumption
that natural causes which function to produce attrition on I ithic
debris occur in a random fashion. It is therefore assumed that the
resulting patterns of attrition wi I I be randomly distributed around
the periphery of the pieces. The occurrence of patterned attrition,
i.e., a series of regular, continuous flake scars (attrition facet),
is interpreted to be the result of non-random processes which may or
may not be the result of intentional use or modification.

LABORATORY ANALYSIS
The use of microf laking patterns to define modification fol lows
Tringham et al.
(1974).
Other studies such as those of Kamminga
(1979), Keeley (1974, 1978, 1980), Keeley and Newcomer {1977), Nance
(1971), Semenov (1964, 1970), and others have shown that the use of
higher magnifications (greater than lOOx) is an effective means of
evaluating other types of modification, i.e., striations, abrasion and
polish. These techniques, however, are very time consuming and
feasible only under the most favorable conditions.
Ode I I (1975, 1980; Odel I and Odel 1-Vereecken 1980) has proposed
that the use of relatively low magnifications (20-40x) are equally
effective and substantially less time consuming. Using this approach
in an experimental use-wear study, Odel I and Odel 1-Vereecken (1980)
were able to analyze each artifact in an average time of from 5 to 13
minutes.
While this is a significant improvement over the higher
magnification analyses, it sti I I does not seem to offer a practical
alternative for the analysis of large collections. During the 1979-80
investigations in the Aqui I la Reservoir, over 12,000 flakes and chips
were collected.
An analysis requ1r1ng 5 minutes per artifact (96
artifacts per 8 hour day) would consume 126 person-days.
One
requ1r1ng 13 minutes (37 artifacts per 8 hour day) would consume a
total of 328 person-days.
The size of the artifacts, of course, affects the amount of time
required for analysis.
By including only that debitage above a
certain size it would be possible to significantly reduce the analysis
time.
For example, the smallest artifact included in the Odel I and
Odell-Vereecken (1980) study measured approximately 4.8 cm by 2.0 cm.
This, however, is significantly larger than most of the debitage
recovered from the Aqui I la area.
Evidence of modification on the
Aqui I la material was discovered on pieces as smal I as 0.9 cm by 0.8 cm
by 0.2 cm, and the modified debitage exhibits a mean length, width and
thickness of only 2.37 cm, 1.79 cm, and .49 cm, respectively. It is
therefore necessary to examine a wide range of sizes to ensure that
the entire range of variation in the modified debitage can be defined.
Processes other than prehistoric use can result in patterned
attrition.
Edge damage can result from a variety of processes, many
that do not reflect intentional prehistoric activities.
Excavation
and hand I ing may produce edge damage which could be mistaken for
intentional
use-wear.
Crushing
due
to
prehistoric
and/or
post-depositional processes must also be considered (Haggerty and
Grinding or
Flenniken 1977; Tringham et al. 1974; Mallouf 1981).
abrading to prepare a striking platform produces patterns which can be
mistaken for use (Crabtree 1974; Sheets 1973). All obviously modern
facets were excluded from the analysis.

9-10

LABORATORY ANALYSIS
For the purposes of this presentation, the attrition facet is
considered to be the minimal unit of analysis. Al I variables were
therefore recorded relative to each facet rather than to the piece
upon which it occurs.
Attrition, particularly if it is defined as
culturally significant, cannot, of course, be understood in isolation
from the debitage upon which it occurs.
For this reason, al I
variables recorded for each class of unmodified debitage were recorded
for the modified debitage. Twelve additional variables relating to
the type, form and location of each attrition facet were also
recorded, as presented below.

Action
Microf lake terminations and abrasion were found to be significant
indicators of the type of action on the material worked by Tringham et
al. (1974) and Odel I and Odel 1-Vereecken (1980). An estimate of the
action which produced the observed attrition and of the material
worked was also recorded for each facet on the basis of the
characteristics described by those authors and summarized below.
0) Cutting - unidirectional action longitudinal to th~ working
edge. Cutting usually produces uneven scarring on both surfaces of an
edge, with alternate scarring which develops into a denticulation of
the edge with use. Striations, when visible, occur near and para I lel
to the working edge. Directionality of scarring, as indicated by
deeper and more sharply defined edges on one side of the microscars,
may occur as the result of true unidirectional cutting.
1) Sawing - Bidirectional action longitudinal to the working
edge. Sawing generally results in scarring similar to that of cutting
but tends to have a greater density of scars on both surfaces.

9-12

LABORATORY ANALYSIS
2) Scraping - Unidirectional action transverse to the working
edge.
Microf laking resulting from scraping activities is restricted
almost exclusively to a single surface with scars distributed in a
more or less continuous section of the flake edge. Striations, when
they occur, are perpendicular to the edge on the opposite surface.
3) Boring - Circular, twisting action with downward pressure.
Boring can produce either unifacial or bifacial scarring which
emanates from the tip.
Abrasion, what Odel I and Odell-Vereecken
(1980:99) refer to as roughening, occurs on the tip.
4) Graving
Unidirectional or bidirectional action on
a
projection.
Graving is characterized by highly localized scarring
and/or abrasion around a projection.
5) Battering or Hammering - Impact scarring in the form of
generally localized step fractures often confined to a facial surface.
6) Unused - No evidence of
under low power magnification.

Material Worked
0) Soft - Materials which include a variety of animal and
vegetal products such as skin, meat, fat, leaves, stalks, rhizones and
tubers, and which offer I ittle or only moderate resistance to cutting
and scraping activities.
Scarring which results from working soft
materials is usually smal I and scalar with feather terminations.
Striations, if they occur, are faint, but polish is common if used for
sufficient lengths of time.
1) Soft medium - Materials include soft woods and other vegetal
and animal products which offer firm but somewhat pliable resistance.
Mussel she I I would also be included in this category. Scarring tends
to be fairly large, feather terminated, and may have an indistinct
"fuzzy" appearance due to abrasion of the scar margins.
2) Hard Medium - These materials consist of hard woods and may
include soaked antler and some fresh bone. Smal I step scars are
typical; the addition of striations and polish is not uncommon.

3) Hard - Materials usually include antler, bone and seasoned
hard woods.
Scarring consists of medium to large step scars which,
with continued use, may obi iterate any scalar scars and striations
present by undercutting the edge margin. Edge rounding from abrasion
ts common where sufficient material has been removed to stabilize the
edge.

LABORATORY ANALYSIS
These categories are not completely satisfactory, but represent
an attempt to define broad divisions of use, and are probably the best
to be expected with the procedures and magnifications utilized here.
The detailed analysis of modified debitage is intended to provide a
further means of determining site function and use areas within sites.
FORMAL TOOLS
The category of formal tools refers to flaked stone tools which
were intentionally shaped by percussion and/or pressure flaking to
produce a specific form. This category includes three subcategories:
projectile points, and bi facial and unifacial tools.
Unifacial Tools
Formal unifacial tools are defined as flaked stone tools which
have unifacial flaking intended to produce a specific form for the
entire tool.
In other words, the entire artifact must
show
intentional unifacial shaping. Retouch along only one or two edges is
not sufficient for inclusion in this category; such an artifact would
be classified as an informal tool with Type 2 attrition. Unifacial
end scrapers and some perforators fall into this category.
Very few
examples of formal unifacial tools were recovered from the Aqui Ila
Lake area.
Bifacial Tools
Formal bifacial tools are defined to include flaked stone tools
which have evidence of bifacial shaping to achieve a specific form.
Although this definition could include certain forms of cores, it is
limited here to those tools where the biface itself composes the
completed tool. Large bifacial ly percussion flaked choppers, would,
therefore, be included in this category. Most of the tools which fit
into this category from the Aqui I la area have been finished by
pressure flaking.
The bifaces from the TAS 1979-80 investigations were classed into
12 categories on the basis of their morphology and technique of
manufacture. Two additional categories, unclassified and irregular,
were used for those bifaces too fragmentary to assign to one of the 12
formal categories or for those which had no recognizable form.
In addition to the defined formal categories used throughout the
analysis,
the
1982 materials
were additionally divided into
manufacture stages based upon the
projected
effort expended.
Specimens were initially divided into thin and thick bi faces based
9-14

LABORATORY ANALYSIS
primarily on thickness measurements, and, for those
borderline
specimens with thicknesses between 1.2 and 1.4 centimeters, also on
workmanship. Thick bifaces were then divided into specimens which
evidenced tool use and those thought to be solely manufacturing
rejects. The latter were further subdivided into roughouts and
blanks.
Roughouts, the cruder of these two, have very sinuous, often
unfinished, edges and generally retain cortex on both faces.
Blanks,
on the other hand, have better made edges and begin to exhibit some
control of form.
Like their thick counterparts, thin bifaces were divided into
tools and rejects (excluding stemmed bi faces, included with projectile
points). The suspected manufacture failures were also divided into
two groups, labeled here as Preform I and Preform II. The former
category includes specimens with slightly sinuous and occasionally
incompletely formed edges, while the latter is composed of generally
wel I made thin bi faces. In the case of fragmentary specimens of the
latter, many of these may be unrecognized portions of projectile
points or other formal tools.
FORM 1
This category consists of medium size subtriangular bifaces
shaped by percussion and finished by fine retouch. This form fal Is
comfortably into the class of artifacts described as gouges (Howard
1973;
Ray 1941; Shiner 1975). The three specimens included in this
form range in size from 4.4 mm to 3.6 mm in length, 3.8 mm to 3.1 nvn
1n width, and 1.3 mm to 1.1 mm in thickness.
FORM 2
This form includes moderately large to large beveled bifaces
similar to one described by Jelks (1962:46-47) from the Kyle Site.
This form does not include the diamond shape, alternately beveled
knives characteristic of the Plains (Krieger 1946). The example
included in this analysis is fragmentary, but was generally shaped by
control led percussion flaking and finished by pressure flaking.
FORM 3 (Cleburne Knife)
Only a single complete specimen could be assigned to this
category.
However, several examples of fragmentary specimens that
could not be confidently grouped into this form were included in the
unclassified group.
Jelks (1962:44-45) describes these bifaces are
subtriangular with convex bases and lateral edges and have rounded
tips.
All specimens were shaped by percussion flaking and show some
pressure flaking.

9-15

LABORATORY ANALYSIS
FORM 4
Form 4 consists of a smal I circular bi face shaped by percussion
flaking and finished around its entire perimeter by pressure retouch.
This specimen is only 30 mm in diameter and 6 mm thick.
FORM 5
Two rounded to ovate medium size bifaces are included 1n this
category.
This form is generally similar to the subtriangular gouges
in terms of flaking patterns, but is significantly more rounded.
The
entire perimeter of both specimens show attrition.
FORM 6 (Covington Knife)
One complete specimen and two rounded basal fragments from the
McDonald Site were included in this category. A fourth specimen from
41HI74/114 may also represent a basal fragment from a Covington knife.
As described by Jelks (1962:42-44), these specimens have rounded
bases, and the complete specimen has roughly para I lei lateral edges
for approximately one-third of its total length that taper to a sharp
tip. The complete specimen is very finely made with delicate pressure
flaking that produced serrated edges. This specimen is more finely
finished than those i I lustrated by Jelks (1962:43, Fig. 17g-f).
FORM 7 (Friday Knife)
Two specimens, 1 complete and 1 fragmentary, were recovered from
the McDonald Site.
The complete specimen is a thin elongate
triangular biface with a straight thinned base and fine serrations on
the lateral edges.
With the exception of fine pressure retouch to
thin the base, this specimen is a classic Friday knife, although it is
a more finely made specimen than those illustrated by Jelks (1962:43,
Fig. 17a-c). The fragmentary specimen represents the mid section of
what is almost certainly another Friday knife.
FORM 8
This form consists of thick triangular percussion flaked
which have varying degrees of pressure retouch.

bifaces

FORM 9
This category may correspond to what previous researchers in the
Aqui I la area have cal led preforms (Skinner et al. 1978; Lynott and
Peter 1975).
It consists of rounded elongate percussion shaped
bifaces with no evidence of edge damage resulting from use.

9-16

LABORATORY ANALYSIS
FORM 10
This category is similar in size and shape to Form 9, but shows
pressure flaking along its periphery and evidence of use in the form
of edge damage.
FORM 11
Form 11 is represented by only a single specimen collected from
41HI74/114.
This
form consists of a large percussion shaped

recovered specimen is a basal fragment which is well finished and
shows evidence of considerable abrasion and Type 1 attrition, as wel I
as polish on the implement surfaces.
FORM 12
This form consists of al I tools with elongate diamond cross
sections which are commonly described as dri I Is. The basal portion
was not considered significant for the specimens from the Aqui Ila
sites and was not used to assign tools to this category as all were
made on flakes.
Projectile Points
The discussion of projectile points in the fol lowing sections is
to morphological and cultural types. Each specimen, where
possible, is discussed relative to previously defined types (Suhm and
Jelks 1962).
Elton Prewitt also kindly reviewed the 1980 collection
and provided a classification on the basis of his extensive work with
projectile points from Central Texas.

Ground and Battered Stone
GRINDING STONES
Grinding stones from the Central Brazos area consist primarily of
hand held grinding stones and grinding slabs. Pitted stones, or
nutting stones, with small ground concave surfaces, have also been
recovered from this area, although none have been reported from the
Aqui I la vicinity.
HAMMERSTONES
Battered stone, as it is used here, refers only to pebbles or
cobbles that show bruising due to repeated blows and that do not
exhibit flake removal, as in the case of a core, or grinding, as in
9-17

LABORATORY ANALYSIS
the case of a mano. Hammerstones are presumed to have functioned in
the production off laked stone tools. In addition to the variables
recorded
for ground stone, the number of battering facets or
contiguous areas of bruising was recorded for al I battered stone.
PIGMENTS
Only smal I quantities of mineral pigments were recovered from the
investigated sites in the Aqui I la Lake area. Pigments have been
included under ground and battered stone pecause virtually al I
examples recovered were ground.
Al I of the variables listed for
ground stone, with the exception of completeness, were recorded for
the pieces of pigment. Both hematite and I imonite were recovered.
MISCELLANEOUS GROUND AND BATTERED STONE
Ground and battered stone artifacts which did not fit into any of
the above categories were included in this residual category. The
majority of the artifacts in this group are Waco sinkers (Watt 1938).
These enigmatic objects are flattened ovate cobbles that have a notch

category are described in the appropriate site section.
Worked Bone
Worked bone, defined as intentionally modified for use, was only
recovered from 41HI105.
A complete description of each item is
presented in the section dealing with that site. Al I worked bone was
identified as to element and species, where possible, and the location
of polish, striations and grinding was recorded. These variables were
then used to determine the technology used in the manufacture of the
bone tools and to identify their function.
Ceramics
Due to the extremely smal I size of the ceramic collection the
analysis was, of necessity, largely descriptive. When possible, al I
ceramic materials were classified into the types defined by Suhm and
Jelks (1962).
Al I sherds were fully described with regard to the
paste and firing characteristics, temper, thickness, surface treatment
and decoration.
The ceramic data provides corroborative evidence
useful in the definition and interpretation of interregional contacts.

LABORATORY ANALYSIS
Faunal Remains
McDonald,
Faunal material was recovered from three sites,
McKenzie and Reps Davis. The material from Reps Davis were recovered
too late in the field season to be integrated into the data base. The
analysis of fauna I materials was I imited to remains recovered from the
McDonald Site, the only site where a sufficiently large sample was
avai I able
to yield meaningful results.
Fifteen variables were
recorded for the faunal remains analyzed.
Unpublished data fromÂ·
faunal analyses by Bonnie Yates of the 1979 materials was included in
the McDonald Site analysis, where possible, but the material was not
re-analyzed.
This analysis was undertaken both to provide insight into the
nature of the prehistoric activities responsible for the deposition of
the faunal remains, and to aid 1n the reconstruction of
the
paleoenvironment of the Aqui I la area.
The recording of detailed
provenience data and such characteristics as the presence and degree
of burning, the location of various types of modification (butchering
marks, grinding, etc.), the type of fractures and the portion of the
element were included in order that such information might be useful
1n the delineation of activity areas.
Each of the recorded variables was entered on a coding form and
key punched for entry into a computer.
The use of the computer
greatly faci I itated the determination of the number of specimens,
species and individuals represented by the fauna I remains, as wel I as
in the definition of potentially significant intrasite spatial
variability.
Radiocarbon Dates
Material for radiometric dating was collected from three sites in
the Aqui I la Lake area: 41HI58, 41HI105, 41HI115. These materials
include charcoal from 41HI58 and 41HI105, shel I from 41HI105 and
41HI115, and organic soi I residues from 41HI105 and 41HI115. Dates
from the 1978 SMU excavations, from 41HI58 and 41HI115, were run at
the SMU laboratory and are included in this report. TAS samples were
assayed at the UT-Austin Radiocarbon Laboratory. The first mention of
any date includes both the uncorrected date (half I ife equals 5568
years) and corrected ranges based on Klein et al. (1982). Subsequent
references include only the uncorrected date.

LIMITED ASSESSMENT SITES - INTRODUCTION

The fol lowing

the
results
of
limited
archeological investigations at nine prehistoric and four historic
sites in the Aqui I la Lake project area.
The investigations at the
sites included in this section were primarily aimed at evaluating the
research potential of the sites in question. Work at these sites was
generally limited to surface collection, shovel testing and backhoe
trenching. None of these sites were extensively excavated.
Two sites investigated during the 1978 field season by SMU,
Both sites, located in
41HI122 and 41HI123, are included here.
planned borrow pits, were tested by means of shovel probes to
determine their potential for further research. Neither of these
sites showed such potential.
Nine I imited assessment sites were included during the 1980
season of work by the Texas Archeological Survey. These included
three steel truss bridges, 41HI119, 41HI120 and 41HI121, which were
included in the Historic Archeology section of the 1980 Scope of Work
(Appendix II, pg.4).
These were determined ineligible.
Three
prehistoric sites (Fig. lO.la 1 b 1 c) 1 41HI106/118 (x41HI119), 41HI107
scheduled
for
limited
(x41HI120) and 41HI112 (x41HI56), were
excavation and one site, 41HI108 (x41HI121), for surface collection
(Appendix II, pg.2). After brief investigations, it was determined
that these sites did not merit further work. Another site, 41Hl104
(Site "A" in the Scope of Work, Appendix II, pg.3), was scheduled for
National
Register
evaluation.
Although this site was heavily
disturbed by borrow activities, it was determined to be potentially
valuable.
A survey of Borrow Area G (Appendix II, pg.3) located one
prehistoric site, 41HI113, which was surface collected during the 1980
season.
It is not thought to be individually eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places.

LIMITED ASSESSMENT SITES

Two sites which were briefly tested during the 1982 season are
ihcluded here. One of these sites, 41HI116 (x41HI135), scheduled for
limited excavation in the 1982 Scope of Work (Appendix II, pg.10), was
trenched to determine its potential for subsurface deposits. The
results of this trenching were negative. An historic site, 41HI103
(x41HI173), originally scheduled for surface collection, was tested
since surface vegetation at the time of investigation was too dense to
al low an adequate sample.
This sample also proved ineffective in
dating the structural remains at the site.
Four other sites scheduled for limited excavation or surface
collection during the 1982 season, 41HI109 (X41HI81-82), 41HI110
(x41HI83-85), 41HI111 (x41HI86) and 41HI165 (x41Hl78), were examined
in more detai I and are included in a subsequent section that describes
investigations at upland sites in the Aqui I la Lake project area.

CHAPTER 11
THE BORROWED SITE - 41Hll04

SITE DESCRIPTION
The Borrowed Site, 41HI104, is located on the modern floodplain
above the angle formed by the confluence of Hackberry and Aqui Ila
creeks, on an area of frequently flooded Tinn clay soi Is.
The
greatest concentration of archeological materials is found along the
north bank of Hackberry Creek. The site, which was exposed by borrow
activities, encompasses an area of approximately 72,500 square meters.
The depth of removal of f i I I from the borrow pit varies from only a
few centimeters to as much as 2.5 meters.
The proximity to the confluence of two low gradient streams
provided a low energy environment (P. Patton, personal communication)
which served to bury archeological materials 1n
a
relatively
undisturbed
state.
The presence of smal I bone fragments and
undisturbed concentrations of burned clay on the exposed surface
throughout the borrowed area support this observation. It is likely
that the sediments containing these archeological materials extend to
even greater depths than those exposed by the borrowing. U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers test cores reveal that clayey sediments reach a
depth of 6 meters below the former ground surface. These cores
indicate that at least an additional 2.0 to 3.5 meters of sediments
that may contain archeological materials are sti I I undisturbed.
Five projectile points and numerous flakes and modified mussel
shel Is were found on the exposed borrow pit surface.
Several
concentrations of burned earth and stones are reported by U.S. Corps
of Engineers personnel to have been exposed by the initial excavations
in the borrow pit. At the time of these investigations, only a single
such concentration could be located.
Since its abandonment as an
active borrow pit, the site has been subjected to severe erosion and
flooding, which have further obscured or destroyed the exposed
archeological features.

41HI104
DATA COLLECTION
Twenty-two working days were expending at the Borrowed Site
during November 1979.
Diagnostic material was collected from the
exposed surface; general lithic debris was not.
An al idade and plane table plan map (Fig. 11.1) was made of the
entire borrow area on which al I exposed mussel shel I, diagnostic
artifacts, features and concentrations of lithic debris were located.
Seventy-six such locations were recorded. A wide variety of materials
were plotted:
single flakes, large concentrations
of
flakes,
projectile points and features (hearths, mussel she I I and bone
concentrations). Two smal I sections of the borrow pit edge were
cleared, and I imited excavations, Excavation Unit 1 and Excavation
Unit 2 (EU 1, EU 2), were conducted to expose portions of two features
disturbed by borrow activities. An arbitrary elevation control point
was established on the original ground surface at the edge of the
borrow pit above EU 1.
The larger of these two excavations, EU 1, was concentrated
around and above Feature 2, a lens of mussel shel I. Excavation in
this area uncovered additional strata
containing
archeological
materials above Feature 2. Excavations around a smal I concentration
of burned earth, Feature 9, in the south bank of the borrow pit
yielded no cultural material.
An isolated concentration of burned
sandstone, Feature 5, which appears to have been a hearth, was also
excavated.
MATERIAL CULTURE
Cultural Features
FEATURE 1
This feature was a light scatter of lithic debris covering an
area about 20 by 30 meters. No diagnostic artifacts were found. The
integrity of associations over such a highly disturbed and broad area
is unclear.
Little can be said about this feature in light of its
disturbed nature and the lack of diagnostic associations. No material
was collected.
FEATURE 2
Feature 2 was a lens of mussel she I I exposed near the base of the
sloping face of the eastern side of the borrow pit. It is from 10 to
20 centimeters thick and extends along the face for about 6 meters,
1.35 meters below the top of the bank, and in the bottom of the borrow
pit for some 15 to 20 meters to the south. Most of the exposed mussel

higher strata containing I ithic debris and fauna I material were
encountered during the removal of the overburden. As a result of the
additional time required to remove the overlying fi I I and associated
cultural materials it was not possible to expose any of the feature.
The partially excavated unit was covered with black polyethylene film
when the work ended in order to provide protection in the hope that
additional work might be possible later.
FEATURE 3
A smal I concentration of deer bones exposed in the bottom of the
borrow pit was designated as Feature 3.
These bones probably
represent a single
individual
or
a single discard
event.
Unfortunately, the highly disturbed context in which this feature was
found precludes the definitive association of materials even 1n the
immediate vicinity.
A bi face fragment was collected from this
feature.
FEATURE 4
Feature 4 was a scatter of I ithic debris, animal bone and mussel
shel I measuring approximately 5 by 15 meters, exposed on the borrow
pit floor. No diagnostic materials were found in the area of this
feature.
FEATURE 5
This feature was an isolated concentration of burned sandstone
which appears to have been a hearth. Unfortunately, the feature was
disturbed both by borrow activities and subsequent digging by unknown
individuals.
A smal I part remained undisturbed and was excavated.
The feature appears to have been a shat low, stone I ined, basin shaped
hearth.
Its original size was approximately 40 by 50 centimeters.
The absence of charcoal and diagnostic artifacts prevents the dating
of this feature.
It is estimated to have been approximately 1.5
meters below the original ground surface.

11-4

41HI104
FEATURE 6
This feature consisted of a light scatter of lithic debris
approximately 6 meters wide and 40 meters long, exposed on the floor
of the borrow pit. A single, non-diagnostic, biface fragment was
recovered from this scatter.
The long axis of the feature was
para I lel to the tracks of excavation machinery in this part of the
borrow area. It seems I ikely, therefore, that the form of the feature
may be the result of the borrowing rather than prehistoric activities
since it was confined to an area encompassing a single scraper cut.
FEATURE 7
A concentration of burned rocks, burned clay, I ithic debitage and
miscellaneous bone fragments was discovered in EU 1, 44 centimeters
below unit datum, 1.07 meters below the estimated original ground
surface (Fig. 11.2).
This feature was about 50 centimeters in
diameter and 17 centimeters in thickness. It was roughly circular and
appears to have been a smal I, trash fi I led pit. The burned earth,
bone and rocks were distributed throughout the f i I I and showed no
definable pattern.

FEATURE 8
A smal I concentration of mussel shel Is, burned rock, bone, burned
earth and charcoal flecks in EU 2 was designated as Feature 8. Eleven
mussel valves, 3 burned fragments of sandstone, and 1 piece of
charcoal were associated with a scatter of burned earth and charcoal
flecks over an area about 50 centimeters in diameter.
No lithic
debris was recovered in or around this feature.
FEATURE 9
A 67 by 40 centimeter area of burned earth and scattered charcoal
along the southern edge of the borrow pit was designated Feature 9.
This feature is bean shaped and appears to be the undisturbed remnants
of a hearth approximately 30 centimeters below the reconstructed
surface of the natural levee which fol lows Hackberry Creek and forms
the southern and eastern edges of the borrow pit (Fig. 11.1). Only a

was no associated lithic debris or other diagnostic materials or
butcher marks, it is I ikely that this is not a cultural artifact but
â¢as a natural death assemblage. The distribution of these remains is
likely the result of natural processes and borrowing activities.
FEATURES:

DISCUSSION

The features exposed 1n the Borrowed Site, 41HI104, indicate that
a number of different activities were carried out in this area.
Concentrations of the intentionally modified mussel shel I, broken on
the weak side of the umbo (features 2, 4 and 8) indicate the gathering
and consumption of freshwater mussels from Hackberry and Aqui I la
creeks. Similar concentrations including animal bones (features 3, 4,
7, 8, 10) also reflect subsistence activities. Quantities of lithic
debitage suggest that stone tool manufacture was also carried out.
Lithic Debris
In light of the highly disturbed
context
and
uncertain
associations of al I materials recovered from the surface of the borrow
pit, a detailed analysis was not performed on the lithic debris.
The
collected specimens are described below.
The sample of material
recovered from the limited excavations is very smal I and serves only
to give an indication of the preservation and associations which were
largely destroyed by the borrow activities. In addition to the damage
from borrowing activities, the site had also been partly subjected to
surface collection by construction workers prior to the arrival of TAS
personnel.
U.S. Corps of Engineers supervisory personnel reported
several projectile points were recovered. A number of hearths were
reported to have been exposed by the borrowing, but subsequently
destroyed or buried by erosion and flooding before work began.
FLAKED STONE
Unmodified Debitage
Table 11.1 shows the distribution of the unmodified I ithic
debitage from this site, which includes 39 secondary flakes, 23
tertiary flakes and 33 chips. Since most of this material is from the
disturbed borrow pit surface, no further discussion is merited here.

Form 5 (2 specimens)
These two ovate bifaces, one of coarse and the other of fine
grained chert, were recovered from widely separate locations. Both
specimens have retouch and edge attrition on virtually their entire
peripheries.
Localized areas of more intense abrasion occur on both
implements and may be related to hafting (Fig. ll.3d,e).
Both
specimens resemble artifacts described as gouges (Blaine et al.
1968:79-81, 83;
Howard 1973:51-60;
Ray
1941:152-162;
Shiner
1975:179-188), but do not fit wel I into previously defined gouge
types. The first specimen (Fig. ll.3d) has a sharply concave edge
that appears to have been used to scrape soft or soft medium material.
A residue adhering to this edge and the adjacent surfaces may have
accumulated as a result of use; it was not analyzed due to lack of
resources and expertise. A second area of edge damage appears to be
the result of cutting soft or soft medium materials. The second
specimen (Fig. 11.3e) shows attrition on much of its periphery,
suggestive of use to cut soft medium materials.
Projectile Points (5 specimens)
Dart points comprised the only projectile points collected from
this site.
Al I were recovered from the surface of the borrow pit.
Each specimen was an isolated find which could not be directly
associated with any of the other materials or features exposed by the
borrowing.
DART POINTS (5 specimens)
Only two of the five dart points could be tentatively grouped
within a defined point type. The remaining three specimens are two
non-diagnostic point tips and the midsection and base of an untyped,
stemmed dart point.
Dawson or Carrol I ton (2 specimens)
The two points tentatively included 1n this group have triangular
blades
with
straight to slightly concave edges and prominent
shoulders. One specimen (Fig. ll.3a) has a long straight stem with

rev1s1on of the Dawson type, it is a Dawson marquez (1974:58-62).
This specimen has some characteristics of the Carrol Iton style,
however, and may be better included with this type.
The second
specimen (Fig. 11.3b) has a moderately long stem with contracting
sides which show some edge grinding and a convex base.
According to
Prewitt's rev1s1on of the type, this specimen is a Dawson mexia.
Except for the grinding on the stem, this point might be a Gary ~m
and Jelks 1962:197-198).
It is also very similar to the Carrollton
type (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954:3; Suhm and Jelks 1962:171-172).
Regardless of whether these points are Dawson or Carrol Iton, they
probably date to the Middle Archaic.
Miscellaneous Dart Point Fragments (3 specimens)
Three dart point fragments - 1 base and midsection, and 2 tips
were also collected from the surface of the borrow pit. The most
nearly complete specimen (Fig. 11.3c) has a short wide stem with a
slightly convex base, and grinding on both the edges and base. The
blade is asymmetrical, so that one edge continues to the stem, only a
slight indentation serving as the shoulder. The other edge has a more
pronounced shoulder.
This point bears some resemblance to Late
Archaic Stage Elam points as defined by Crook and Harris (1952,
1954:11;
Suhm and Jelks
1962:185-186).

Discussion

The lack of vertical control relative to the original ground
surface and the variable depths of the borrow pit severely complicate
even the most elementary attempts at stratigraphic placement and
reconstruction. The floor of the borrow pit varied in depth below the
original ground surface. Since the points were recovered from the
surface of the borrow pit floor, which is at or lower than the
elevation of Feature 2, they probably predate the deposition of that
feature, and were buried under approximately 1.0 to 1.3 meter of
alluvium. If this is the case, the three strata above Feature 2 must
date to after the Middle Archaic.
SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In a 11 Ii kel i hood, 41Hl104 is not a single site but a number of
unrelated sites or features associated only by their fortuitous
exposure tn a single borrow pit.
The features and artifactual
materials appear to represent a series of discrete, short term
occupations which took place over a considerable period of time.

11-11

41HI104
There were no structural remains observed that would suggest long
term occupations, nor were the refuse deposits of sufficient density
or volume to indicate that the area was occupied for extended periods.
Conditions were not, however, ideal for the discovery of such
features, and the extent to which the archeological deposits were
destroyed
is not fully known.
It can be estimated from the
distribution and quantity of materials exposed on the floor of the
borrow pit that, by far, the largest part of the site was destroyed.
In spite of this extensive destruction, this site, and others in
similar topographic positions, have perhaps the greatest archeological
potential of any open sites in the area. Their location adjacent to
low gradient, flood prone streams that carry high sediment loads,
minimal
produces situations with well defined stratigraphy and
disturbance due to the low energy depositional environment. The
alkaline Tinn clay soi Is that occur in these situations are also
conducive to excel lent bone and shel I preservation. Leaching in these
soi Is is slow and is largely confined to carbonates.
In addition,
these sites have been protected from vandal ism and agricultural
impacts by an overlying stratum that is often archeological ly sterile.
These protective sediments probably obscured most of these sites unti I
earthmoving activities or natural erosive processes exposed the
underlying deposits.
In the case of the Borrowed Site, portions of the intact
archeological deposits are preserved in the margins of the borrow pit
and potentially significant strata may occur below the present borrow
pit floor.
It is estimated, on the basis of stratigraphy and
diagnostic projectile points, that this site was occupied during the
Middle and Late Archaic. The archeological strata appear to represent
numerous short term intermittent or seasonal occupations.

41Hl106/118

SITE DESCRIPTION
Site 41HI106/118 is on the south bank of Hackberry Creek at an
elevation of approximately 160 meters above sea level. It is on a low
alluvial terrace approximately 1.28 kilometers northeast of the
confluence of Hackberry and Aqui I la creeks, in the bottomland forest
environment of the Black land Prairie.
As originally recorded, the
site was estimated to cover an area about 60 by 60 to 90 meters (site
form on file at TARL).
Skinner and Henderson (1972:29), however,
report the site as covering an area 40 by 100 meters. The 1980 TAS
re-examination suggested an area of only about 40 by 70 meters for
41HI106/118 and recorded a second smal I site, 41HI118, in the
northwestern corner of the same field.
During the Management Data
Survey, the TAS crew relocated this site and examined the surface
evidence which suggested that the two site areas were not so easily
separable.
Since it appeared from an examination of the original SMU
forms that the entire northern portion of the field had originally
been recorded as x41HI119, these two sites were once again combined as
41HI106/118. The site, shown in Figure 12.1, is now estimated to be
approximately 100 meters north-south by almost 200 meters east-west.
According to the Soi I Conservation Service (Brooks 1978), the
greater part of the site area is Tinn Clay, while a smal I portion of
the southeastern corner of the field is mapped as Kemp loam.
Tinn
Clay, a floodplain soi I, is classified as a fine, montmori I lonitic
(calcareous), thermic Vertie Haplaquol I, while Kemp loam, also a
floodplain soi I, is classed as a fine loamy, mixed, non-acid, thermic
Aquic Udif luvent (Brooks 1978).
Although mapped by the SCS as
floodplain soi Is, at least part of the site I ies on a distinct low
rise above the apparent modern floodplain.
Patton (Chapter 3) has
mapped this area as part of the TO/Tl terrace.
Although some
subsurface probes would be required as confirmation, it is suggested
here that the site is on the Tl terrace or another low intermediate
terrace rather than the modern floodplain. Part of the northwestern

portion of the site (mapped by Watson 1982 as 41HI118) may I ie on the
actual floodplain.
The site is not located on the T3 terrace of the
creek as originally described by Watson (1982:274).
SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK
The site was initially located and recorded as x41HI119 by SMU
personnel in 1972 (Skinner and Henderson 1972). At that time the site
was 1n a cultivated field that has since been abandoned.
No
additional work has been undertaken at 41HI106/118 since its initial
discovery.
It is not clear from either Skinner and Henderson (1972) or the
original site form whether or not this site was completely collected.
SMU notes indicate that 16 prehistoric artifacts were recovered but
this collection could not be relocated for examination. If this was
the sum total of artifacts, the site was defined on the basis of an
artifact density of only one artifact per 190 square meters, using the
area recorded on the original site form (on file at TARL) or one
artifact per 2500 square meters, using the area reported by Skinner
and Henderson (1972:29). The TAS re-examination supports these very
low densities.
DATA COLLECTION
To judge from the degree to which the field containing the site
was overgrown, it had not been cultivated for several years before the
TAS work. In order to expose the ground surface, 11 strips were
plowed at 15 meter intervals from the northwest to southeast across
the abandoned field (Fig. 12.1). Materials were then collected and
recorded in accordance with the procedures presented in Chapter 8. No
subsurface probes were conducted. Ten working days were expended at
this site during March 1980.
MATERIAL CULTURE
The SMU records indicate a collection of 16 prehistoric artifacts
and one historic button.
Mussel she I I was reportedly present.
Unfortunately, as noted above, the collection was not relocated.
Notes on file at SMU report 5 flakes, 5 chips, 1 retouched piece, 1
core, 2 hammerstones and 2 dart points. The dart points are described
as bases, tentatively identified as Gary and Yarbrough types.

12-3

41HI106/118
Only 3 flakes (2 secondary, 1 tertiary), 1 smal I core fragment, a
piece of possibly burned sandstone and a fragment of freshwater mussel
shell were recovered from the 1980 TAS investigations.
Observed but
not collected during the Management Data Survey, were 3 flakes, a
biface fragment and a piece of possibly pecked or ground quartzite.
The sample is too smal I to make any significant generalizations.
SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Little can be said about this site other than that it represents
I imited
or highly disturbed evidence of aboriginal activities.
Investigations to date do not indicate a significant archeological
deposit;
however, no subsurface investigations have been undertaken.
If a portion of the site extends into the Tinn clay soi Is of the
modern floodplain, there is a possibility that intact deposits exist.

41Hll07 AND 41Hll08

Richard P. Watson and David 0. Brown

SITE DESCRIPTION
Sites 41HI107 and 41HI108 are discussed together due to their
proximity to each other and possible relationship. Both sites were
originally defined as I ight I ithic scatters located on the south bank
of Hackberry Creek between 161 and 168 meters (528 - 551 ft.) MSL
(Skinner and Henderson 1972:29-30; site form on file at TARL).
On
the original SMU site form for 41HI108 (x41HI121), it describes
41HI107 (x41HI120) as being 20 meters to the northwest. Figure 13.1,
drawn from U. S. Army Corps of Engineers topographic maps, shows the
general area of these sites and their approximate locations.
As reported by Skinner and Henderson (1972:29), 41HI107 covers an
area of about 200 by 75 meters, or 15,000 square meters. This site
appeared to be significantly smaller upon re-examination. A much more
conservative estimate, based on a re-evaluation of the original site
forms and field inspection, is an area of about 40 meters in diameter.
Site 41HI108 is substantially smaller, covering an area of about 100
square meters (Skinner and Henderson 1972:30).
Both sites are on the valley side in an area mapped by the Soi I
Conservation Service as Birome-Rayex complex soi Is (Brooks 1978). The
hi I Islope here is mapped as belonging to the Lake Waco Formation of
the Eagle Ford Group (Barnes 1970), although the sites themselves may
actually be on a smal I remnant of higher alluvial terrace abutting the
Upper Cretaceous valley margin.
These sites are both within the Blackland Prairie, although this
area has a relatively high density of various oak species, and is
probably best considered as an ecotone between the Cross Timbers and
the Blackland Prairie. In addition, both sites are near the edge of
the riparian lowland forest. Modern vegetation consists of scattered
smal I and slightly larger post oaks. The near absence of larger trees
suggests that the area is an abandoned field or pasture. The presence

of an agricultural terrace that fol lows a contour roughly halfway up
the valley side is also indicative of historic modification in the
area.
SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH
These sites were originally discovered by SMU personnel in 1972
(Skinner and Henderson 1972). An artifact catalog sheet with the SMU
survey records indicates that a surface collection of 26 I ithic items
was made from 41HI107 (x41HI120) at the time of the survey but, with
the exception of a single Seal lorn arrow point, this collection could
not be relocated.
Eighty-two I ithic specimens

sherds and 3 smal I mussel she I I fragments were found with the
collection (although the catalog sheet specifically states that mussel
she I I was not present at 41HI108). There was no additional work at
either site unti I investigations were undertaken by TAS.
DATA COLLECTION
Both sites were apparently completely collected at the time of
discovery.
Since both are now overgrown and no subsequent activities
or natural processes had occurred to expose additional cultural
materials, it was decided that plowing of at least part of each site
might provide useful information on artifactual patterning. The sites
are both presently overgrown with mesquite and post oak which
prevented the use of the systematic plowing procedure adopted for
41HI106.
As a result, as much of each site as was feasible was
plowed, using the buster plow as described in Chapter 8.
After
plowing, al I furrows were inspected and al I materials recorded and
collected.
MATERIAL CULTURE
Two flakes (1 secondary and 1 tertiary), 1 chip and 1 mussel
shel I fragment were recovered from the 1980 TAS investigations at
41HI107. According to the SMU artifact catalog sheet, the 1972
collection recovered 14 flakes (1 primary, 2 secondary and 11 tertiary
specimens) and 11 chips. A single projectile point was recovered.
This expanding stem arrow point fits the Seal lorn classification (Suhm
13-3

41HI107 - 108
and Jelks 1962). Its tip is broken and the wide blade angle and
retouched edges suggest that it may have been resharpened from a
previous distal break. Maximum specimen width is just less than 20
mi I I imeters.
Maximum thickness is just over 4 mi I I imeters. Minimum
stem width is 7 mi I I imeters; maximum stem width 1s 12 mi I I imeters.
Stem length is 6 mi I I imeters. This smal I point is side notched with
straight barbs and a sharply expanding stem. The base of the stem 1s
slightly concave.
It is manufactured from a reddish brown chert,
probably of local origin. No materials were recovered from the 1980
investigations at 41HI108, nor were any observed in this area during
the 1982-83 resurvey.
The SMU catalog sheet I ists the material
collected from this site as including 40 flakes (8 primary, 15
secondary and 17 tertiary), 24 chips, 7 bifaces, 3 retouched pieces, 7
cores and 1 hammerstone.
No re-analysis of this material has been
undertaken. In addition to these materials, 3 stoneware and 5 plain
white ironstone sherds were included in the collection.
SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
On the basis of materials recovered from these sites little can
be said about the prehistoric activities responsible for the their
formation. The presence of a Seal lorn arrow point reported from
41HI107 during the initial SMU survey (site form on file at TARL) may
indicate a Late Prehistoric occupation for 41HI107 and possibly for
the nearby 41HI108.
However, the position of these sites on the
valley slopes poses potentially significant problems
to
their
interpretation.
The Birome-Rayex soi Is on which these sites occur
erode readily unless sodded (U.S.D.A. 1972:15). The presence of an
agricultural terrace on the valley slope suggests that an attempt was
made to control erosion, probably during a period of cultivation.
At
present the slopes are heavily eroded, but how much of this is
attributable to historic agricultural activities is not known. It 1s
entirely possible that the materials recovered are 1n a derived
context, and bear little if any resemblance to their original
associations.
The shallow nature of these soi Is and the steep slope,
approximately 10%, are not likely to have
preserved
original
archeological associations under these conditions.
The extremely low artifact density on 41HI107 supports an

frequency reported by Skinner and Henderson (1972:29), 41HI107 was
defined on the basis of an artifact density of one artifact per 577
square meters. Even using the more conservative estimate presented
here, the density remains very low, one artifact per 144 square
meters. Such low densities suggest that the site was not completely
collected.
The observed density of material upon re-investigation
however, supports such low densities. The second site, located up
13-4

41Hl107 - 108
slope to the southwest of 41Hl107, had a much higher artifact density
at the time of discovery, one artifact per 1.22 square meters.
This
site may have represented an area of primary deposition.
Subsequent investigations by TAS at 41Hl108 failed to recover any
material, suggesting it may have been completely collected at the time
of discovery or that it was incorrectly located.
Proceeding on the
assumption that the site was correctly identified, then the entire
deposit was apparently collected and the material probably represented
a lag deposit or a surface deposit resulting from downslope movement.
On the other hand, the original survey form contains several apparent
contradictions in specification of site location. A visit to the area
during the 1982-83 Management Data Survey was unsuccessful
1n
pinpointing the exact location from the description given, and the
dense vegetation at that time made search efforts futile.
It 1s
probably best to consider 41HI108 unrelocatable.

SITE DESCRIPTION
This site is at the base of a steep slope at the contact of the
TO and T3 terraces on the west bank of Aqui I la Creek. It is
approximately 900 meters upstream from the confluence of Aqui I la and
Hackberry creeks, at an elevation of 155 meters (508.4 ft.) MSL. The
site was originally recorded by SMU and given the site number X86. As
originally defined, the site was estimated to be approximately 25
meters in diameter and less than 25 centimeters in depth (Skinner and
Henderson 1972).
Relocation was hindered by the fact that the site
was completely collected at the time of discovery 1n 1972 and no
subsequent processes or activities that would expose additional
materials had modified the ground surface.
The site is in the Eastern Cross Timbers biotic zone. The slope
above the site is largely denuded of soi I but supports a scattered
growth of mesquite and post oak. Woodbine sandstones and shales occur
on the slope immediately above.
SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK
This site was originally recorded and collected by SMU personnel
1n 1972 (Skinner and Henderson 1972). TAS relocated the site during
the 1979-80 investigations. At this time, 4 chert and quartzite
flakes that could be attributed to human activities were found on the
surface. In addition, several smal I fragments of fire cracked rock
indicated that this area may have been the locus of aboriginal
activities.

DATA COLLECTION
To determine the exact nature of this site, a 50 by 50 cm shovel
test was excavated at the base of the slope from which the material
was recovered. Al I excavated f i I I was screened through 1/4 inch mesh

MATERIAL CULTURE
The sample of materials recovered 1s of insufficient size to
effectively categorize the activities carried out. Indeed, there 1s
some question as to the nature of the deposit from which these
materials were recovered. Dr. P. Patton believes that archeological
materials in sediments at the foot of the slope, as wel I as those
recovered from its surface, are I ikely to be in a derived context. If
this is the case, and it is wel I supported by the present morphology,
al I of the materials from this site are of unknown origin and
associations. As a result, the work of both SMU and TAS has served
only to document an association of archeological materials from a
given locality. Continued investigations of a wide range of sites 1n
similar topographic positions may provide useful information on
post-depositional impacts as wel I as on prehistoric
activities
conducted there.
Such investigations were beyond the contractual
I imitations of the present research, however. A summary of the entire
inventory of materials recovered from this site is presented in Table
14.1 to facilitate comparisons as work continues in this area.

SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In I ight of the questionable association of materials from this
site, a statement of cultural significance is not possible. The
presence of artifactual remains does not conclusively indicate that
this
area
served
as
a
locus
of
prehistoric
activities.
Post-depositional factors, principally downslope erosion, may have
transported the materials from further up the slope. In fact, site
41HI156 (SMU x41Hl55) was defined directly above 41HI112 during the
initial survey (Skinner and Henderson 1972). The interpretation of
this and similar sites, depends on their detailed investigation within
a
wel I
defined
chronological
framework
to
elucidate
the
post-depositional and cultural factors affecting them.

SITE DESCRIPTION
This site consists of a very sparse scatter of I ithic debris
covering an area of approximately 150 by 80 meters on the T3 terrace
on the left bank of Aqui I la Creek. It is approximately one kilometer
south of the confluence of Hackberry and Aqui I la creeks. At the time
of discovery, the cotton field in which the site was located had been
recently plowed and afforded excel lent visibility. Site 41HI113 is
located on Houston Black Clay soi Is in the Black land Prairie uplands.
DATA COLLECTION
41HI113 was recorded during
a
survey
of
a
previously
uninvestigated, proposed borrow pit (Area G). Most of the area was
under cultivation at the time. The entire proposed borrow area was
systematically surveyed by a crew of 3 to 6 people at 5 to 15 meter
intervals. Artifactual materials were recovered from only two areas
within the borrow pit.
The first consisted of the lithic scatter
designated 41HI113. The second area containing I ithic debris was
located downslope in an abandoned and terraced field. Vegetation
cover was very dense and visibi I ity poor. Under these conditions, a
sufficient density of material could not be located to justify the
designation of another site. The few isolated pieces of I ithic debris
from this area may be derived from 41HI113, at the top of the slope.
Al I material from 41HI113 was recorded by transit bearing and
distance from a datum set on the northwest corner of the site. This
datum was located with reference to permanent U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers bench marks so that it could be re-established for future
work, if necessary.

MATERIAL CULTURE
Flaked Stone
UNMODIFIED DEBITAGE
Flakes (11 specimens)
Of the 11 flakes from this site, 1 is a primary, 4 are secondary
and 6 are tertiary flakes.
Al I are chert, probably derived from
Uvalde gravels. Three types of platforms are found:
2 cdrtex, 2
single facet and 7 multiple facet. Four of the flakes have ventral
platform I ips and none show any evidence of burning.
Chips (4 specimens)
One of the chert chips evidences exposure to high temperatures.
Cores (1 specimen)
One relatively large (7.2 x 7.2 x 5.3cm) multidirectional chert
core was found on the site. It has both faceted and cortex platforms.
MODIFIED DEBITAGE/INFORMAL TOOLS
Type 1 and 2 Attrition (2 specimens, 4 facets)
Two indeterminate I ithic fragments have both Type 1 and Type 2
attrition on two facets.
On both specimens the attrition facets
appear to be the result of scraping of soft materials and, in at least
one case, might be attributable to prehension.
FORMAL TOOLS
Bifaces (1 specimen)
One poorly flaked rectangular biface was recovered from the
surface. The entire periphery of this implement was retouched and has
step terminated Type 1 attrition on much of the worked edge. The edge
damage is so diverse that it is not possible to suggest a probable
use. This specimen may represent nothing more than a failed attempt
at bifacial reduction.

SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The artifactual materials recovered from this site indicate only
that it probably served as the locus of stone tool production. The
diffuse scatter of lithic debris covered an area of some 12,000 square
meters and probably represents a series of discard events that had no
original association with each other.

SITE DESCRIPTION
This site is located on the west bank of Hackberry Creek just
upstream from its confluence with Jack's Branch. Located on the slope
of the upland edge (see discu~sion below) and in the adjacent
floodplain, it is less than 50 meters north of the creek at the
extreme southwestern end of
the
upland
projection.
Surface
indications of the site are found in an area approximately 120 meters
east-west by 60 meters north-south, primarily on the north bank of a
shallow slough and in the bottom of a slightly deeper historic gully
that leads west toward the creek from the slough (Fig 16.1).
The upland projection north of the site 1s mapped by Barnes
(1970) as Upper Cretaceous Lake Waco Formation (Eagle Ford Group).
Observations of the hi I I slope support this, showing various layers of
shales and I imestones. Despite this, the upper surface of this upland
projection is extremely flat, in contrast to the rol I ing hi I Is farther
to the north, and may be an alluvial deposit. This is supported by
the SCS maps which show Branyon clay, a soi I supposedly formed on
nearly level old terraces, on the upper surface of this landform
(Brooks 1978:56). In any case, the scarp, being rocky and nearly 10
meters in height, is probably more similar environmentally to an
upland edge than it is to other lower terrace scarps.
Although part of 41HI116 1s shallowly buried in colluvial
materials on the hi I Islope, most of it is found on the surface of the
alluvial fan extending down off the upland projection and onto the
floodplain.
The site is actually located on the eastern edge of a
broad floodplain area surrounding the confluence of Hackberry Creek
and Jack's Branch. Several faint old channel scars can be seen in the
floodplain area, but the most prominent is the one that borders the
site.

The primary soi I type is frequently flooded, Pursley clay loam,
described
as
having formed in calcareous, loamy sediments on
floodplains (Brooks 1978:67). This soi I is classified as a fine
loamy, mixed, thermic Fluventic Haplustoll. The typical profile has
alternating strata of brown sandy clay loam and pale brown fine sandy
loam down to at least 180 centimeters. Mapped adjacent to the site is
an area of Venus clay loam.
SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK
Site 41HI116 was initially recorded in 1972 (as x41HI135) during
the pre I iminary SMU archeological survey of the Aqui I la Lake project
area. Described as a "concentration of shel I and I ithic artifacts,
100x40 m" (Skinner and Henderson 1972), 31 artifacts were collected
from the surface. The artifact analysis of the 1972 collection is
rather interesting.
The site showed a relatively low percentage of
flakes and chips contrasted to a high percentage of lithic tools
(excluding bifaces and cores whose percentages were relatively low)
and the highest percentage of pecked and ground stone artifacts from
the project area.
Lithic debris is similarly interesting, with the
second highest percentage of primary debris contrasted to the lowest
percentage of secondary debris. Other than another visit in 1975 by
the SMU survey crew (apparently no collection was made at this time),
no further work was conducted at the site unti I the 1982 season.
DATA COLLECTION
During the 10 field days expended in March 1982, the primary goal
was a determination of the possibility for and potential condition of
subsurface cultural remains at the site. Initial visits by TAS staff
showed a I ight scatter of cultural material on the surface at the base
of the upland slope. Cultural material visible at this time was
I imited to mussel shel I, burned sandstone and a smal I amount of chert.
The greatest density occurred in the U-shaped gully at the east end of
the site, where a number of whole and fragmentary mussel valves
(almost exclusively Amblema Pl icata Perplicata where identifiable), a
few smal I fragments of burned sandstone, 1 thermally altered piece of
chert and 1 possible chert flake, were strewn along the bottom of the
gully. A view of this gully, showing mussel shel I scattered across it
is shown in Fig. 16.2b. The other concentration of surface material
I ies along the north bank of a filled in, abandoned channel in the
southeastern corner of the cultivated field on the floodplain, east of
the confluence of Jack 1 s Branch and Hackberry Creek.
Material
observed in this area included mussel valves and fragments (primarily
the latter), burned rock, large unaltered blocks of sandstone (from

looking from the slough in the cultivated field to the hi I I side corner
1s shown in Fig. 16.2a.
The problem at the site was determining the or1g1n of this
material.
Careful examination of the wal Is of the gully containing
cultural material, an adjacent gully to the south that contained none
and a more recent, partially fi I led in, abandoned channel to the east,
showed no trace of a buried cultural layer. In order to determine the
subsurface extent of this material, if any, five backhoe trenches were
excavated. Locations of these trenches are shown in Figure 16.1.
None showed any concentration of cultural material or any strong
indication of a buried occupation layer. Only three trenches (A, B
and D) contained any hint of cultural material. Trenches C and E were
who I ly sterile.
SITE STRATIGRAPHY
Most of the area containing 41HI116 is f luvial deposits. Four of
the trenches (al I except B) were dug into pure alluvial sands and
clays while the fifth apparently encountered Cretaceous clays or
decomposed shales (Woodbine?, Lake Waco?) at its upper end. Much of
the remainder of the unit may have been col luvial ly deposited from the
slopes above.
Two apparent f luvial terraces are present, based on
sedimentary and topographic differences at the site. The older of the
two extends northward from the bank of the old channel in a broad arc
para I lel ing the upland hi I lside.
Sediment in this terrace is a
calcareous I ight tan sand that shows clearly in the smal I trench north
of the old channel (BHT E) and in the lower portion of the hil lslope
trench (BHT B).
Fol lowing the SCS soi I maps, this older terrace is
mapped as Venus Clay Loam, a soi I frequently found on older alluvial
terrace surfaces (Brooks 1978, Brown 1983).
The fol lowing description of the strata 1n the smal I trench north
of the old channel, i I lustrates the soi I stratigraphy of this
apparently older terrace. The profile of BHT E is shown in Figure
16.3a.
Despite the fact that cultural material was observed on the
surface surrounding it, no indication of subsurface cultural material
was found.

The lower and more recent terrace, which is probably the
equivalent of the modern floodplain, I ies to the south and west of the
old channel in the field. Sediments are more clayey and darker 1n
color, although sti I I somewhat calcareous. This area is mapped by the
SCS as Pursley clay loam (Brooks 1978).
In some respects, the
sediments of the Venus clay loam terrace resemble the historic
deposits that cap the aboriginal occupations at the McDonald Site
several kilometers downstream, thought to have originated from early
farming in the Lexington area, a I ittle more than a kilometer upstream
from 41HI116 on Jack>s Branch. The Venus clay loam is mapped as a
strip extending up along the upland edge fol lowing Jack>s Branch and
was definitely deposited by that stream. This formation is older than
the floodplain in this area, given its topographic position and the
intensity of carbonate formation, and suggests that this 1s a
relatively old drainage. An interesting commentary on the provenience
of the historic cap at the McDonald Site is that, despite the presence
of the lighter sandy soi I in the upper terrace, the sandy, crushed
shel I, layered sediment typical of this cap was not observed in the
darker floodplain sediments near this site.
On the other hand,
similar sediments were clearly seen 1n the upper strata at the
McKenzie Site, a kilometer upstream from here on Hackberry Creek, and
along a gully that drains the Union Bluff area, east of Lexington and
west of Hi I lsboro.

16-7

41Hl116
There may also be remnants of several older and higher terrace
levels at the site, although these are probably erosional benches. At
least two topographic flats can be identified between the Rowe Site
(41Hll60 - x41Hl137) on top of the hi I I and the Venus clay loam level.
The top of the hi I I itself, lying at the edge of a large flat
topographic high, is regarded as the remnant of a terrace perhaps
equivalent in age to the large high terrace area above and between the
confluence of Hackberry and Aqui I la creeks.
The surface of the lowest terrace or floodplain area 1s marked by
several sets of fi I led in paleochannels and/or flood scour channels as
wel I as a distinct levee formation near the banks of the modern
channel of Hackberry Creek.
With the exception of the cultural
material observed in the col luvial sediments of BHT B, what little
subsurface cultural material was observed came from the modern
floodplain.
The stratigraphy of the lower terrace/floodplain area is simple,
as is i I lustrated by the profile of BHT D (Fig. 16.3b) that shows only
two strata. The upper stratum (Zone 1) is a dark grayish-brown silty
clay with pebbles, snai I shel Is and calcium carbonate mottling. Below
this is a thick stratum (Zone 2) of undivided dark brown clay, mottled
at the bottom of the trench, which cut into the high water table. No
cultural material was observed in this trench or on the ground surface
near it. These two identical strata were also observed in BHT A, cut
across the gully containing the mussel she I I (Fig. 16.4c).
The only
difference in this trench was that scattered mussel shells were
observed near the bottom of the upper stratum, as wel I as a possible
burned sandstone chunk.
Although these could not be unquestionably
identified as a cultural deposit, the possibi I ity exists that they

fragments seemed to cluster at two elevations, the upper one near the
bottom of the gully and the lower some 30 to 50 centimeters beneath
this, near the boundary between the strata. The opinion of the crew
was divided on the reality of these levels, and there is no question
that they were traced on the basis of very few she I Is.
The remaining floodplain/lower terrace backhoe trench, BHT C,
(Fig. 16.4a) was nearly identical to the other two, with the exception
of an obvious surf icial plow zone layer (Zone 1). Otherwise, Zone 2
in this trench is equivalent to Zone 1 in the other two trenches and
Zone 3 to Zone 2 in the others. A few mussel she I I fragments were
observed at a depth of approximately one meter, but as with BHT A,
this material could not be clearly associated with any aboriginal use
of the site.

The only convincing subsurface cultural material was recovered
from BHT B (Fig. 16.4b), upslope from the gully with the mussel shel I
scatter and Trench A. Material was observed in the walls of the
trench and the backdirt excavated from it. Where observed in situ,
this material was shallow, generally between 20 and 40 centimeters
deep, with clay bedrock and old terrace sand buried shallowly beneath
the surface. The primary cultural indication was the presence of
mussel shel I that, uni ike the shel I found in the floodplain trenches,
was both more numerous and not in any topographic situation where
mussel she I I could occur naturally, except perhaps in animal dens. In
addition to the mussel she I 1, several possible burned rocks were noted
in the profile and backdirt, and at least one chert flake was
observed. Al I or nearly al I of the material noted in situ appeared to
be highly disturbed, either skewed or standing verticaTfY, a possible
indication of the col luvial origins of the materials.
Although a
col luvial origin is clearly indicated for the soi I matrix and many of
the rocks, the source of the cultural material is not clear. Although
it seems possible that it may be a secondary deposition from above, no
surficial cultural materials were observed in this area, and the Rowe
Site (41HI160) 1 at the top of the hi I I, is too high and too far away
to have contributed this material without leaving some intermediate
traces.
It may be that the materials are not redeposited but related
to an occupation on the upland slope at a time when the old creek
channel abutted the edge of the hillside. In any case, the deposit of
cultural material was highly disturbed during the process of col luvial
deposition of the soi I matrix. The stratigraphy of BHT B is shown in
Fig. 16.4b and the strata are described below.

SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Observations on the surface and during the excavation of five
backhoe trenches suggest that cultural material other than mussel
shel I and burned rock is very limited at 41HI116.

here,

Much of the
very dubious specimen of ground stone were recorded.
"cultural" material present now consists of whole mussel shel Is
(naturally occurring in the gully?), tiny mussel shel I fragments (with
fractures of indeterminate origin) and sandstone rocks from the nearby
hi I Iside (some of which may possibly be burned).
This contrasts
somewhat with the 31 specimens recorded in the 1972 SMU collection,
but it appears that the site is primarily a surf icial expression with
no possibi I ity of regeneration of a sample of cultural material after
ten years.
SMU may have I iteral ly "collected away" the site.
Examination of the original SMU site survey forms shows that there is
absolutely no question of mistaken site location in this particular
case, as the slough, gully and upland edge are clearly shown on the
site map.
Although there were several hints at a subsurface expression of
the site during the 1982 trenching operation, there was either no
evidence of a cultural origin of the materials
in the floodplain
trenches
or strong disturbing influences present (in BHT Bon the
hi I lside. Because of this, it was decided that control led excavations
would not be useful.
After the trenching operation, the site was
mapped, but no collection of material was made.
Despite the paucity of cultural material observed during the 1982
season, al I evidence points to this site as an aboriginal occupation
site, albeit disturbed and with I ittle potential for recovery of
useful cultural information.
The density of mussel shel I suggests
that the site fal Is in an exploitative niche somewhat similar to the
nearby McKenzie Site (41HI115), an observation possibly supported by
the low density of debitage (assuming that SMU's collection was nearly
the whole I ithic assemblage). The relative absence of purposefully
crushed she I I amid the high frequency of whole she I I casts some doubt
on the similarities, however.
In addition, the high percentage of
ground and pecked stone artifacts collected by SMU, and apparent
presence of burned rock, indicate that the site served other functions
as wel I.

SITE DESCRIPTION
Site 41HI122 is situated on the floodplain on the west bank of
Hackberry Creek (Fig. 17.1), approximately 50 meters from the creek at
an elevation of 150.4 meters (493.3 ft.) MSL. The site area has been
severely disturbed by the excavation of a trough silo. Artifacts are
present on the disturbed surface surrounding this depression which is
approximately 40 meters long and 20 meters in breadth. The maximum
depth of the depression is approximately 2 meters. Sparse stands of
scrub oak and several types of grasses provide the vegetation cover
within the site area today.
DATA COLLECTION
Seventy-three artifacts were collected from the surface of
41HI122 (x89) during the 1972 investigations (Skinner and Henderson
1972:25). Due to the location of the site within a prospective borrow
pit for the Aqui I la Lake dam, it was necessary to test for the
presence of any undisturbed subsurface cultural deposits.
Excavation
of the depression revealed a sparse scatter of artifacts buried in the
floodplain. The presence of in situ deposits, however, remained to be
demonstrated.
- -Twenty-four shovel tests were used to test areas peripheral to
the depression. The holes were placed 10 meters apart and were dug to
a depth of 40 centimeters. An arbitrary datum point was placed near
the center of the site as defined by the surface artifacts, and
transects of test holes were extended to the expected perimeters.

MATERIAL CULTURE
The 24 shovel tests yielded a total of 53 artifacts; 3 molluscan
fragments, 1 unidentified bone, and 49 pieces of I ithic debris. The
I ithic debitage consists of 32 chert flakes, 13 chips, and 4 pieces of
non-diagnostic
shatter.
The majority of these artifacts were
recovered from the test holes along both the south and east sides of
the depression (Fig. 17.1). Unfortunately, no temporally diagnostic
artifacts were recovered.

SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The test holes excavated at 41HI122 revealed a concentration of
artifacts along the southern and eastern borders of the depression.
The usually conservative estimates of artifact densities by shovel
tests indicate that the subsurface deposits at 41HI122 would yield
moderate artifact densities. Unfortunately, the once-primary context
of these artifacts has been largely destroyed by the excavation of the
depression; many of the shovel tests merely sampled soi I from the
depression. Since most of the site context had been either removed or
displaced, no further work is recommended.

SITE DESCRIPTION
Site 41HI123 is located on the eastern slope of the ridge between
the Aqui I la and Hackberry creek drainages (Fig. 18.1). Situated at an
elevation of 153.59 meters (502.8 ft.) MSL, the site overlooks
Hackberry Creek which is 400 meters to the east. Like much of the
Eastern Cross Timbers biotic zone, the site area has been cultivated
for many years and presently I ies fallow with brush, grasses, mesquite
and a few oak trees. Several shallow erosional channels crosscut the
area.
DATA COLLECTION
Site 41HI123 was originally recorded during the 1972 survey of
the proposed reservoir area (SMU site x90) (Skinner and Henderson
1972:25). At that time only a sparse scatter of lithic debitage was
recovered from the surface. Testing of the subsurface deposits was
prompted by its location within a prospective borrow pit for the
Aqui I la Lake dam. Ful I evaluation of the site was necessary so that
the possibi I ity of costly construction delays could be avoided.
Testing of the subsurface deposits at 41HI123 was accomplished
through the excavation of 51 shovel tests. An approximate east-west
base line was established para I lel with the ridge.
Test holes were
excavated at 10 meter intervals along this base I ine. Two north-south
transects (Fig. 18.1) were also sampled in
the
same
manner.
Additional tests were excavated in the southwest portion of the site
where lithic debitage was noted in an erosional gully.
The shovel
test holes were dug to a depth of 40 centimeters.

Although none of the historic artifacts permit a precise temporal
framework for the occupation, an early twentieth century use of the
site is most I ikely. The presence of household wares in association
with the remnants of a foundation suggest the former presence of a
farmstead. The abandonment of this structure is undocumented.

SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Subsurface testing of 41HI123 revealed that the subsurface
assemblage was equally as sparse as the surface material observed in
1972. The very ephemeral prehistoric occupations have been disturbed
by agricultural activities and erosion. The later historic use was
apparently less ephemeral; however, remnants of a house foundation
are the only intact historic feature. Whether or not the area served
as a home site or as an entire farmstead 1s not apparent from the
meager evidence.

ANDERSON CABIN - 41Hll03

David 0. Brown and Jack M. Jackson

SITE DESCRIPTION
The Anderson Cabin Site, 41HI103, I ies near the eastern edge of a
broad, gently sloping bench on the upland slope 200 meters west of
Rocky Branch. The site is about 0.9 kilometers upstream from the
confluence of Rocky Branch with Hackberry Creek.
Elevation 1s
approximately 167.6 meters (550 ft.) MSL.
The site consists of a
smal I multi-room
structure
1n
various
states of disrepair
(Fig. 19.la), the foundation of a second structure (Fig. 19.lb), a
partially rock I ined depression (Fig. 19.lc), a stock tank and several
fences.
The standing structure consists of two rooms, both partially
fallen, and the pi lings of a third room, now removed, to the south.
The room to the north has board and batten siding and a fallen wood
shingle roof.
The central room is constructed of hand hewn, corner
notched logs with no sign of floor or roof. No evidence remains of
the construction of the third room.
This structure, unused for a number of years, was apparently last
used as a farm outbui Iding of some sort. Whether or not it was ever a
dwel I ing is not known, but the construction of the central room
suggests it was intended for use as a barn, storage shed or something
similar. This central room appears to have been bui It from the logs
of an earlier structure, probably a cabin, without regard for careful
fitting of the pieces. Also, it seems that no floor or roof was added
to the rebui It structure.
The corner notching of the logs reused to construct the
outbui Iding show a combination of half dovetai I and square notching.
According to Jordan (1978:78), dovetailing and square notching are
those notch types most commonly used for permanent houses, schools and
pub I ic buildings. Outbui Idings were more often constructed using the
less demanding and precise "V" or saddle notching techniques. This

bui Iding technique is typical of that used by the upper South yeoman
farmer during the mid-nineteenth century.
It is a difficult and
demanding technique when used with large hardwood logs. Normally this
bui Iding method was abandoned as soon as sawn lumber became readily
avai Iable in an area. Presumably lumber from Colonel Gathings' saw
mi I I at Covington, which produced $12,000 worth per year according to
the 1860 census, would have been avai Iable at a reasonable price.
It
was for this reason that Jackson (Chapter 12; 1982) believed that the
house was bui It before 1860.
The present standing structure was
erected at a much later date using logs from the dismantled older
house.
The rebui Iding theory 1s further supported by the measured
distances between the stone piers in the foundation located 30 meters
south. The remains consist of eight square rock piers and two chimney
foundations
arranged in a large rectangle.
Dimensions of the
structure are 46 feet by 17 feet.
The arrangement of the piers
suggest that the structure was divided into two large square rooms (17
by 17 ft) with a 12 foot breezeway separating them, in the manner of a

possible because these were covered with rubble and
partially
destroyed, but they are estimated to be about 5.5 to 6 feet long and
at least 4 feet wide. They are centered at either long end of the
structure (See Fig. 19.2).
As noted above, the length of the hand hewn specimens from the
standing structure, about 17 feet, matches the distances between piers
in the foundation. This not only supports the theory that the lumber
was removed from the structure, but that it was comprised of two 17 by
17 foot rooms. Further evidence of this is found in the presence of a
few hand hewn beams sti I I remaining in the foundation area. These are
cut identically to those of the standing structure.
The other possible historic structure at the site is a rock I ined
depression about 40 meters west of the foundation.
Rocks are
scattered over about 180 degrees of the southern arc of
the
depression.
No rocks at al I have been observed in the north. It has
been suggested that this is a col lapsed wel I or cistern and this 1s
I ikely, although there is no clear evidence that such is the case. It
may also have been a root eel lar or, possibly, a rock lined spring
head. The only surface artifacts observed occurred in this depression
- a few bottles and ceramic sherds dating to the twentieth century.

SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK
The site was first recorded as x41HI173 by S. Alan Skinner in the
summer of 1978. His site form (SMU files) describes only the standing
log structure.
Subsequently, the
site
was
visited
by
TAS
archeologists who discovered the historic foundation in a thicket
south of the standing structure. Deed records were researched and the
fol lowing ownership history compiled.
Land Ownership History
The original grantee, Andrew S. Castleman, sold the entire 640
acre survey to Edward M. Brown for $13.50 cash, 2 horses valued at
$100.00 each and notes for the balance. This transaction is recorded
in Hi I I County Deed Book G, page 347. In 1858 Brown sold 175 acres to
Thomas B. El I iot for $851.35 (Hi I I Co. Clerk, Deed Book I:498, 647).
Elliot
is listed in the 1859 tax rol I (Texas State Archives
ms. Comptroller's Off ice) as owning this parcel of land, now evaluated
as worth $1,000.00, 10 horses, 83 cattle, a team of oxen and a wagon.
The total value of his property was assessed at $2,118 and his tax was
$7.28.
The $150.00 difference between his purchase price and the tax
valuation suggests that some improvement, such as a cabin, had been
added.
The El I iots sold the land to Harvey W. Young on December 21,
Young sold the land in 1863 to Levan W. Anderson. Anderson is
1861.
I isted in the 1864 tax rol Is as owning three slaves.
The Anderson
family was sti I I I iving on the property when they sold a 25 acre
parcel to James Hooker in November 1875, retaining the section where
the cabin is found. The property is I isted in the names of the "heirs
of L.W. and E.L. Anderson" after 1900.
The gravestones 1n Hickey
Cemetery show that Levan W. Anderson died June 28, 1884 at age 65 and
that his widow, E.L., died 13 years later in 1897 at age 71. Thus it
1s supposed that the couple continued to I ive on the farm for the rest
of their I ives.
Sam H. Anderson and his wife, having cleared the mortgage liens,
presumably of other heirs, became sole owners of the property in 1905.
Thus the property remained 1n the Anderson family wel I into the
twentieth century.
It is only possible to speculate as to who actually bui It the
cabin which left the intact foundation and the few reused logs of the
later shed. The Andersons, who lived there together for 21 years, are
certain to have erected some permanent home, therefore they are the
I ikel iest candidates. However, the El I iots I ived on the property from
1858 to 1861 and could have put up a cabin in that time. As pointed
19-5

ANDERSON CABIN
out above, the jump in the value of the land from its purchase in 1858
to the tax assessment of 1859 suggests that some major improvement was
made during the interim.
DATA COLLECTION
Originally, this site was scheduled for a surface collection and
more
detailed recording.
Recording was accomplished using the
accompanying map (Fig. 19.2), supplemented by a series of black and
white, and color photographs.
Surface collection was initially
suggested as an aid to recording and to assist determination of the
site's National Register potential. Unfortunately, the surface was
dersely covered with grass throughout the period of investigation.
The only surface material observed was in the stone I ined depression
at the western edge of the site;
on examination, this material
appeared to consist entirely of twentieth century garbage.
As an alternative to surface collection, it was decided to
excavate a 2 by 2 meter unit in the foundation area to attempt dating
of this structure. As noted previously, the stone footings of the
foundation suggest a double pen, dog trot house. The test pit was
placed so that it lay between and encompassing at least one edge of
both of the central foundation piers on one long wal I. The unit was
located on the eastern wal I on the assumption that the front door and
porch would have been on this side, facing the floodplain of Rocky
Branch.
The test square was so placed in hope of detecting evidence of
the original bui I ding activity. This spot would have been protected
by the front porch of the cabin through most of the occupation,
excluding the detritus of household pets who might have sheltered
there. Unti I the porch floor had deteriorated badly or was removed,
any smal I items lost or discarded during the erection of the cabin
should have remained relatively undisturbed.
This unit was excavated in four, 1 meter quadrants.
Careful
excavation of the initial quadrant showed no indication of natural or
cultural stratigraphy in the 20 centimeters of soi I above sterile
clay. Therefore, since the entire cultural stratum was thin and since
the object of the excavations was to determine earliest date of
occupation, the entire matrix was removed as a single stratigraphic
unit.

MATERIAL CULTURE
Table 19.1 shows the materials collected from the four quadrants
of the test unit. Examination of this material shows little of it to
be of temporally diagnostic value, particularly in any attempt to fix
an historic occupation date for the site. Many of the items are sti I I
manufactured commercially, or were within the last several decades.
Some of the artifacts can be identified as early twentieth
century or earlier. Slate fragments, part of broken writing slates,
span the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
Square nai Is,
which dominate the nai I assemblage, became uncommon commercial items
after the first quarter of the twentieth century, but were commonly
reused in rural construction for many years after.

In the analysis of the artifact collection al I nai Is, window
glass and mortar, which appears to be I ime-sand chinking plaster, were
classified as architectural items. Clothing items included only the

and rodents, included bone and seed fragments. Al I other
artifacts were classed as "other".
A total of 883 items were
recovered 1n the test excavations.
Of these, 784, or 89%, were
architectural, the bulk being nai Is and window glass.
The classic
frontier house site yields between 12.9 and 35.1% architectural
artifacts (Lewis 1977:193).
Although the nai I variety indicated
several uses and at least two periods of construction activity, the
window glass was of uniform thickness. This would indicate that the
bulk of this material resulted from the demo I it ion of the structure.
Six buttons, representing slightly less that 1% of the sample,

confidently ascribed to the nineteenth century.
The subsistence
items, mostly smal I bone fragments, numbered 22 or 2% of the total
sample. None of the bone could be assigned to a particular species.
There were 3 fragments of a peach pit and 1 piece of a pecan she I I.
Kitchen items were equally sparse. Seven smal I white ironstone
sherds without diagnostic markings and 24 bottle fragments, totaling
31 items or 3% of the total, were recovered. Only a section of the
I ip of a crown capped bottle has any time diagnostic value. The Crown
Cap was patented in 1892 (Lorraine 1968:44) and this was deposited
after this time. The remaining "other" artifacts include 50 items or
about 6% of the total. Of these, only a large flat metal file would
seem to have been lost and not discarded. A plastic comb fragment was
also found.
None of the artifacts clearly indicate a nineteenth century date,
much less the 1860s date ascribed by Jackson's historic research, to
the construction of the house. One of the buttons, of a type commonly
manufactured in the late nineteenth century (H. Moncure, personal
communication), is the earliest artifactual evidence from the site.
It would appear that the bulk of the artifacts relate to the
single incident of the demolition of the cabin. One can hardly
explain the presence of modern roofing nai Is under the porch in any
other reasonable manner. Both the square and wire nai Is, as wel I as
19-10

ANDERSON CABIN
the window glass and chinking mortar, must be
assigned
this
interpretation.
It must be admitted that any indication of the
original bui Iding debris, or a nineteenth century remodeling using
square nai Is exclusively, would have become mixed with the artifacts
from the more recent construction at the site.
SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The Anderson Cabin Site consists of a standing, hand hewn lumber
structure with adjacent, recent mi I led lumber structure, a large dog
trot foundation and a possible col lapsed wel I or eel lar.
The hand
hewn structure is obviously rebui It and out of place. Comparative
measurements suggest it once formed part of the structure on the stone
pier foundation south of the standing ruins.
It is suggested that this structure was bui It in the 1860s.
The
size and configuration of the house, as wel I as the stone pier
foundation, appear to support a
mid-nineteenth
century
date.
Examination of the artifactual evidence, however, does not support
this hypothesis particularly wel I. This deposit seems to indicate the
cabin was dismantled during the twentieth century.
None of the segments of the standing structure are considered
significant
historic cultural resources.
The mi I led lumber is
relatively recent and not unique or distinctive, while the hand hewn
lumber pen is obviously rebui It, possibly more recently than the
mi I led lumber portion.
Both are in disrepair and probably not
salvageable.
The foundation and stone I ined depression, on the other
hand, cannot be so easily dismissed. The size and configuration of
the house seems to place its initial occupation during the nineteenth
century. Preservation of the foundation is good, and it has been
established that artifactual materials, albeit recent, are buried to
some depth around the piers. Further excavations here might yield
valuable information about historic material culture. Although the
test excavations failed to disclose any clearly mid-nineteenth century
artifacts, the hand hewn hardwood logs with their carefully cut half
dovetai I and square notches, would be difficult to interpret as
anything other than mid-nineteenth century.
There may yet exist
unfound nineteenth century trash pits and other buried features.
However, the current condition of the remaining foundation would not
reasonably support a nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places without some further evidence of a buried deposit with
archeological study potential. Currently there is no evidence of any
such deposit.

HISTORIC STEEL TRUSS BRIDGES
SITES 41Hll19, 41Hl120 AND 41Hll21
Jack M. Jackson

A requirement of the scope of work was the examination, recording
and evaluation of three steel truss bridges within the reservoir
region. Two of the bridges span Aqui I la Creek and the other crosses
Hackberry Creek. When the bridges were recorded in the fall of 1981,
al I three were on unused, deteriorating county roads. Only one bridge
had enough intact roadway to be cal led passable in 1981, and it had
large gaps in the floor planking. At present, al I three bridges have
been removed and the roads closed at lake's edge. All three were
photographed, recorded, measured and researched in the county records
during a two day field period in 1981. A letter report with the three
site forms was submitted on October 5, 1981.
The Texas Historical
Commission Guide I ines (1983) state that:
.. to meet National Register Criteria, the bridge must
usually be at least 50 years old. It must be a good example
of a type, period or method of construction; or be the work
of a master craftsman; or be of high artistic merit; or be
important to the history of the area; or be associated with
an important person or event.
Bridges may be of local,
state or national significance.
This same pamphlet gives specific guidelines as to the information
required for the evaluation of each bridge against these National
Register criteria. These criteria and guidelines wi I I be used here
although they were pub I ished after the time of the original recording
and evaluation of the bridges.

20-1

HISTORIC BRIDGES
41HI119, AQUILLA STEEL BRIDGE NO. 1
This bridge was erected around 1936 by J.A. Fulwiter, under a
contract with the county dated November 12, 1935. This contract for
several smal I bridges is discussed in the Hi I I County Commissioner's
Minute Book M, page 249.
The span was erected from prefabricated
trusses furnished by the Jones and Laugh! in Co., Inc.
It spans
Aqui I la Creek with a 12-foot oak roadway, 60 feet long.
The
substructure consists of telephone-type creosoted wooden poles.
The
superstructure is composed of prefabricated pox truss sides without
any overhead connection (Fig. 20.la).
The bridge was missing an
estimated 60~ of its floor boards at the time it was examined, but
otherwise seemed in structurally sound condition.
It was always a
purely utilitarian structure with little aesthetic appeal. This
bridge cost the taxpayers $490 Depression dollars.
Under the National Register criteria quoted above, this bridge
meets the minimum 50 year age in 1986. However, in view of the
unremarkable nature of the structure, no nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places seems warranted.
41HI120, AQUILLA STEEL BRIDGE NO. 2
This bridge (Fig. 20.lb) is very similar to Bridge No. 1 but
carries a wider, 16-foot roadway across Aqui I la Creek. It too was
erected by J.A. Fulwiter under the same contract with the county, but
for a slightly higher price, $535 (Hi I I County Commissioner's Minute
Book M, p.249). No manufacturer's marks could be read on this bridge
although it is of exactly the same box truss with no overhead braces
as the bridge at 41HI119. This bridge is 60 feet long and is missing
only an estimated 20% of its floor planks. One of the telephone pole
pi lings of this span is clearly marked with a 1935 date. It could not
be established that this was ever associated with any historical event
or important person. The significance of either this bridge or the
one at 41HI119 to the economic development of the region would be
limited to the relatively few farms that lay on the county roadway,
and this effect would have been minimal during the middle of the Great
Depression. The bridges might have been financed through Federal
funds intended to create jobs.
These are both very simple, steel
truss prefabricated spans meant to be erected by a few men with
wrenches and shovels. No sophisticated engineering or technological
problems were addressed in the design or erection of either bridge.

HISTORIC BRIDGES

41HI121, THE W.R. ROBISON BRIDGE
This bridge bears a bronze plaque which reads "W.R. Robison,
County Commissioner 1906".
The main members bear a trade mark
"Cambria". The contractor, the George E. King Bridge Co., erected the
span for $720 under the terms of a contract let November 17, 1905
(Hi I I County Commissioner's Minute Book G, p.9).
The bridge is 70
feet long and supports a 12-foot roadway of oak planks (Fig. 20.lc).
It is of the high side box frame type with horizontal beams over the
roadway.
The substructure is wooden pi lings. The bridge was stil I
standing in 1981, but was 1n very poor repair. There was evidence of
rust damage so severe as to impair the structural integrity of the
span.
This bridge meets the age criteria and could be nominated to the
National
Register of Historic Places if some degree of local
significance could be established.
Telephone calls were made to
various members of the Hi I I County Historical Commission during 1981
in an attempt to find some local significance and suggestions for the
possible site of a hypothetical relocation.
However, no local
significance was attached to the bridge. The TAS letter report of
October 5, 1981 suggested that "should sufficient local interest
develop in dismantling and relocating one of these bridges, the 1906
bridge over Hackberry Creek (41HI121) is suggested as the rarer
example." There are, as of August 1983, eight bridges within Texas
listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Only one of these
is newer than this bridge, six are nineteenth century structures. The
lack of local historical significance suggests that, despite its age,
41HI121 does not meet current criteria for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places.

CHAPTER 21
LIMITED ASSESSMENT SITES - SUMMARY

David 0. Brown

As noted in the introduction to I imited assessment sites, nine
prehistoric and four historic sites were included in this section.
Only one of these, 41HI104, seems to meet criteria for nomination to
the National Register of Historic Places, as determined by testing in
the 1980 season. Unfortunately, this site had been heavily disturbed
by borrow activities at the time of its discovery by Corps of
Engineers personnel. Only a relatively smal I portion of the known
site remains intact in the balks separating the borrow area from the
creek. The site may wel I extend downward below the level of the base
of the borrow pit, but this was not ascertained during the 1980
testing program. In any case, 41HI104 does contain hearths and mussel
shel I concentrations buried at some depth in the floodplain of Aqui I la
Creek.
On the basis of the evidence gathered in the field, none of the
rema1n1ng prehistoric sites appears to be eligible individually for
the National Register. In retrospect however, information gathered
for these sites may not be sufficient to determine that they are
definitely not eligible.
In I ight of this, a brief, critical
re-evaluation of the testing programs at these sites is included in
this chapter.
Although few archeologists would go so far as to say that buried
alluvial sites are the main source of primary archeological contexts,
there is I ittle question that such sites are of critical importance in
many areas for the establishment of stratigraphic and chronological
controls. The value of such sites is emphasized by their rarity. The
difficulties in finding such sites are wel I known, and are clearly
i I lustrated by the Aqui I la Lake Project, where initial survey failed
to locate significant buried cultural resources in the alluvial
bottoms. Prior to 1978 and the discovery of the McDonald Site
21-1

LIMITED ASSESSMENT SITES
(41HI105), only one floodplain site, the Reps Davis Site (41HI58), had
been determined
important enough
for
extensive excavations.
Subsequent to the 1979 discovery of 41HI104 in a borrow pit, several
other buried sites were found in borrow pits, including 41HI133,
41HI197 and 41HI198. In addition to these, several previously known
sites were found to contain components buried in the floodplain.
These sites include 41HI76 (x41HI162), 41HI132 (x41HI105) and possibly
41HI138 (x41HI138) .
Adequate assessment of deep sites requires deep subsurface
probes, combined, if possible, with minimal controlled testing.
Shovel probes and posthole testing, which may be more than adequate
for the assessment of upland sites, are rarely effective techniques
for the discovery of buried alluvial sites.
Four of the sites discussed in the preceding section, 41HI107,
41Hll08, 41HI113 and 41HI123, are upland sites where shovel testing,
and, in cases, observation of natural subsurface exposures, are
generally sufficient to determine site significance. In rare cases,
as at the Pilgrim Site (41Hl124) and the Bailey Site (41HI77),
discussed in the next section, unusual circumstances may combine to
bury cultural materials at some depth. In any case, such burial 1s
only rarely deeper than the range of shovel probes.
In addition to the purely upland sites I isted above, two sites,
41Hll12 and 41HI116, are on upland margins and may extend down into
the floodplain. At the latter site, this possibility was investigated
with five backhoe trenches which showed no indication of a buried
prehistoric component. By the time of the Data Management Survey,
41HI112 had been bul I dozed for vegetation clearing and construction of
a haul road. At that time, the remaining cultural material extended
from the base of the hi I I slope onto what appeared to be a low terrace
remnant of Aqui I la Creek. The possibi I ity that cultural material may
have been buried in this shallow terrace may not have been exhausted
with the single shovel test placed there.
The two remaining prehistoric sites, 41Hl106/118 and 41HI122, are
located on low terraces above the floodplain, apparently intermediate
between the TO and Tl terraces. These two sites are discussed 1n
slightly more detai I below.
When 41Hl122 was visited by the Data Management Survey crew in
January of 1983, it was found to lie on a slight rise above the modern
remnant. Unfortunately, an extensive borrow area to the south and
west made it difficult to accurately relate the site to this original
surrounding topography. Interestingly, the soi I observed on this
knoll area was not the dark grayish-brown Tinn clay of the surrounding
floodplain, but a somewhat lighter sandy loam. The excavated feature
21-2

LIMITED ASSESSMENT SITES
1n the middle of the site appears to have been a trough silo I ined
with concrete, most of which has since been broken up and removed.
Examination of the distribution of artifacts suggest~j that they are
associated with the spoi I dirt from the excavation.
Many of these
materials may have been excavated from a buried context in the old
terrace soi I. Since many of the shovel tests did not penetrate
beneath the spoi I dirt lying on the surface, it is not possible to
clearly state that this site was totally disturbed or contained no
buried materials.
At 41HI106/118 1 however, no shovel testing was attempted.
This
site, which apparently I ies on a very low terrace remnant less than a
meter above the modern floodplain, was examined through the use of the
buster plow (as described in Chapter 8). While such use of the plow
is perhaps appropriate in testing sites such as 41HI107 and 41HI108,
believed to be relatively shallow hi I I side sites, or at the Brazi I
Site (41HI75), where cultural materials apparently extended to the
surface of the old terrace deposit, it is not, by itself, an
appropriate methodology for testing a site that might contain a buried
component.
Some form of deep subsurface probing such as backhoe
trenching should have been uti I ized in combination with the surficial
plowing.
Thus, in the case of this site as wel I as that of 41HI122,
while it is possible to state that neither one is eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places on the basis of available data,
some questions sti I I remain.
The potential of the four historic sites described in this
section is discussed in some detai I within their respective chapters.
It is simply reiterated here that none of these sites is individually
eligible for the National Register. The bridges are not considered
eligible because they are neither particularly unique nor in a good
state of preservation. In any case, they could not be saved in place,
and clearly do no merit the enormous time and expense necessary to
preserve them at another location.
The Anderson Cabin (41HI103) is unquestionably old enough to
qua I ify for the National Register, but does not seem to offer any
special research potential in historic archeology, nor
1s
it
associated with any persons significant in local history, either
criterion of which might be used in its nomination.
On the other
hand, since it is not scheduled to be destroyed by lake construction,
it is suggested that the Corps of Engineers might endeavor to protect
it from looting or unnecessary destruction. If future plans cal I for
a pub I ic park in this area, the existing features at the site could be
integrated into the park design.

UPLAND SITES - INTRODUCTION

The term "upland" is frequently used in archeological research.
Although perhaps too vague to be of great utility in a detailed
settlement pattern study, it can be useful in some general models such
as the one attempted here. As defined here, an upland area is one
that I ies above the Holocene alluvial fi I I of the stream valley. This
is a rather specific extension of typically general geological
definitions such as the one given rn (c) of Bates and Jackson
(1980:678):
The elevated land above the low areas along a stream or
between hi I Is; any elevated region from which rivers gather
drainage. Also, an area of land above flood level 1 or not
reached by storm tides.
The important operating criterion in
this
definition
is
al luviation;
areas excluded from uplands wi I I be areas of extensive
Holocene sedimentation with the potential for rapid and perhaps deep
burial of sites. Burial of sites also occurs in the uplands, but is
usually much slower and shallower, increasing the possibi I ities for
disturbance, and thus comp I icating archeological interpretations.
In the Aqui I la Lake project area, the upland category includes
sites on the T2 terrace (see Patton, Chapter 3 1 this report), which
Ritchie and Slaughter (1972) have dated to the Sangamon, and on the
eroded Cretaceous sediments of the Woodbine Formation and Eagle Ford
Group. Several of these sites extend onto lower terraces or the
floodplain, but the largest area of the site or at least the primary
area investigated, is on these higher and older landforms.

UPLAND SITES
Investigations at five sites are included in this section:
the
Pi I grim Site (41HI124), investigated in 1978 by SMU, the Bailey Site
(41HI77), investigated in 1980 by TAS, and three sites from the 1982
TAS field season, 41HI109, 41HI110 and 41HI111. A fourth upland site,
41HI165, scheduled for surface collection in 1982, was found to lie
almost entirely outside the boundaries of the Corps of Engineers
project lands.
A smal I surface collection of unmodified source
materials was made at this site and is described briefly in the
concluding chapter of this section.
Al I five sites have yielded sufficient quantities and kinds of
data to possibly make them individually eligible for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places; they are certainly eligible as
a part of the Aqui I la Multiple Resource District. Unfortunately,
extensive portions of al I these sites were destroyed during reservoir
construction.
The Pi I grim Site, which has had a meter or more of its
surface stripped away for f i I I for the dam, no longer exists.
Next
most heavily damaged is the Bailey Site, which has been cut through by
a haul road as wel I as having its surface bul I dozed during the lake
vegetation clearing.
Disturbances at this site are so
margin
extensive that it is difficult to ascertain if any intact deposits
remain.
Al I three of the McDonald hi I I side sites, 41HI109, 41HI110 and
41HI111, have been partially bul I dozed for vegetation clearing. Al I
three may also have a smal I intact area remaining above the clearing
I imit.
The hardest hit is 41Hl110, where construction of the
Hi I lsboro Water Supply Intake Tower destroyed a considerable portion
of the site.
Al I three, and especially 41Hllll, extend onto the
floodplain, where they may have buried components.

SITE DESCRIPTION
This site is at the eastern edge of the Hackberry Creek
floodplain
(Fig. 23.1),
about 2.4 kilometers northeast of the
confluence of Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks. The site extends from the
floodplain up onto the lower slopes of the creek valley wal I, ranging
between 158.5 meters and 164.6 meters {519.5 - 539.9 ft.) MSL. At its
closest point, the site is 200 meters from the modern channel of the
creek (Fig. 23.2). Most of the cultural materials at the site occur
within an area 100 meters north-south by 100 meters east-west, but the
distribution within this area is patchy, with visible debitage
covering an area of only about 4000 square meters. A very I ight
scatter extends onto the floodplain to the south, essentially linking
the site with materials on the floodplain at 41HI110. However, no
cultural material has been observed on the slopes between these two
sites and their separation 1s maintained here.
The geology of the lower portion of the hi I Islope at the site 1s
mapped as Woodbine Formation, the middle and upper slopes as Lake Waco
Formation, and the hi I ltops as South Bosque Formation (Barnes 1970).
Observations at the site show limestone beds near the top and bottom
of the hi I Islope. Extrapolating from the geological cross section
(prepared by USACE) of the dam area 2.5 kilometers south, it appears
that the upper bed, at about 177 meters (580 ft.) MSL probably
represents the lower boundary of the Lake Waco Formation. Thus the
site I ies entirely on Woodbine Formation sediments.
Soi Is formed along the slopes are identified as belonging to the
Gasi I fine sandy loam series, with eroded 3 to 5% slopes. This fine
loamy, siliceous, thermic, Ultic Paleustalf has a typical profile
showing less than 20 inches (51 cm) of brown or yellowish-brown fine
sandy loam A horizon over 40 to 80 inches (102-204
cm)
of
brownish-ye! low or reddish-yellow sandy clay loam B horizon (Brooks
1978:61-62). The A horizon and portions of the B horizon have
apparently been stripped by erosion from much of 41HI109.

41HI109

Abutting the lower slopes of the hi I I are recent alluvial
deposits of Hackberry Creek (Barnes 1970) that are either part of the
modern floodplain or the lowest and most recent terrace of the creek.
Soi Is formed in these alluvial deposits are classified by the SCS as
Tinn Clay, a fine, montmori I lonitic (calcareous), thermic, Vertie
Haplaquol I (Brooks 1978).
Tinn series soi Is are described as deep,
clayey floodplain soi Is formed in calcareous, clayey alluvium (Brooks
1978:70).
A typical profile has up to 60 inches of gray clay A
horizon overlying a gray, olive or yellow clay C horizon with
prominent bedding planes. An excel lent example of a nearby floodplain
soi I profile is i I lustrated and describedÂ· 1n the chapter on the
McDonald Site (41HI105).
41HI109 I ies within the lowland forest association of the
Blackland Prairie.
The floodplain portion has been cleared for
agricultural use and is now overgrown in tal I grass. At present the
lower slopes are dominated by mesquite and retama. Farther up the
slope are broadleaf oak, winged elm and a number of iess common trees.
The site has been disturbed by plowing at its western edge and
perhaps the lower slopes have been cleared as wel I. A rutted and
The
eroded road crosses the site near the foot of the slope.
hi I lslope has been badly denuded by erosion and several deep gullies
have formed. Para I lel to the road at the base of the slope is an
artificial field terrace and its associated borrow ditch. In al 1, the
site has been heavily disturbed and I ittle soi I depth remains. It rs
not clear whether or not cultural material extending out onto the
floodplain represents a buried deposit there or redeposition off of
the hi I lside. Restriction of this material to the margin of the base
of the slopes and the low density favor redeposition.
SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH
This site was initially recorded as two distinct sites by the
original SMU survey (Skinner and Henderson 1972). The northernmost,
x41HI81, was described as a "dense concentration of lithic debris and
tools, pottery" and was assigned to the Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric (Neo-American) periods (Skinner and Henderson 1972:24).
Southeast of this, an area of "scattered I ithic debris" was recorded
as x41Hl82. Both of these sites were selectively collected and
recommended for further investigation.

23-4

41HI109
Lynott and Peter (1977) mapped and tested both sites.
At the
northernmost of the two (x41HI81), eight posthole tests were dug, none
of which yielded any artifacts. No collection was made at that time.
Lynott and Peter concluded that the site was eroded and disturbed, not
meriting further work_
At x41HI82, they excavated four posthole
tests, three of which encountered sterile clay just beneath the
surface, and surface collected three 10 by 30 meter areas.
Their
report indicates that this site was also badly eroded and disturbed.
Site x41HI82 has been tentatively interpreted as a foraging
station because of its I imited areal extent (Lynott and Peter
1977:76). An Archaic occupation date is suggested, based on the
bifacial reduction technology and the presence of a stemmed dart point
basal fragment, noted as Bulverde-I ike because of its wedge shape base
(specimen i I lustrated in Lynott and Peter 1977:f ig 28f). Site x41HI81
was suggested to be either a seasonal occupation camp or a foraging
station.
No date was offered by Lynott and Peter, although Skinner
and Henderson assigned it to the Late Prehistoric Period on the basis
of at least one bone-tempered plain sherd (i I lustrated in Skinner and
Henderson 1972:fig. Sc). No evidence is offered for the additional
assignment of a Late Archaic date.
DATA COLLECTION
Prior to the inception of the 1980 TAS fieldwork it was decided
that further reassessment would be needed for the series of sites
located along the valley wal I northeast of the confluence of Aqui I la
and Hackberry creeks (x41HI81 through x41HI86) to determine their
el igibi I ity for the National Register of Historic Places.
Limited
excavation, collection and mapping were carried out during two field
seasons by the TAS, to ascertain each site's potential el igibi I ity and
to better understand the function of these sites within a regional
framework. Twenty work days were expended at 41HI109 from March to
May of 1982.
Pre I iminary observations at sites x41HI81 and x41HI82 showed them
to be I inked by a very I ight scatter of cultural materials, and they
were subsequently redesignated as a single site
41HI109.
The
original sites exist as discrete clusters of greater artifact density
within the larger site (see Fig. 23.2), but the configuration of the
clusters is clearly a consequence of patterns of erosion rather than
cultural factors.
The 1980 TAS investigations at 41HI109 included a control led
surface collection of selected artifacts, two 50 by 50 centimeter
shovel tests excavated to a depth of 50 and
90 centimeters
respectively, and a 90 centimeter deep profile cleared along the face
23-5

41HI109
of one of the gul I ies. No cultural materials were recovered from
these initial subsurface tests. The 1980 investigations essentially
verified Lynott and Peter>s (1977) conclusions that this site has been
def lated
and disturbed, at least 1n the eroded northern area
(originally x41HI81).
During the 1982 TAS investigations two backhoe trenches were
excavated on the hi I I slope at the southern end as an aid to
understanding the geomorphology of the site. These trenches confirmed
the primarily col luvial origins of the slope, suggesting that the only
potential for preservation of cultural stratigraphy would be on the
smal I, flat, outwash fan near the base of the hi I lside (see section on
site stratigraphy).
Test Pit 1
Subsequent to the trenching operation, a 2 by 2 meter unit was
placed on the outwash fan north of BHT 2 and just south of a gully
where smal I quantities of chert debitage were observed. This area was
one of the only uneroded portions remaining on the southern half of
the site (the former x41HI82).
Four 10 centimeter levels were
excavated in 1 meter square quadrants, but because of the ground
slope, level 1 was present only in the southeast quadrant.
These
levels were screened through 1/4 inch mesh hardware cloth with the
exception of the northwest quadrant of levels 3 and 4, which was
screened through 1/8 inch mesh.
The upper two levels were dry
screened but, because of the increase in clay content near the bottom,
the lower levels had to be water screened.
No features were encountered in this unit (or anywhere at the
site) although a number of cobble size sandstones were scattered
throughout. One large, apparently unmodified sandstone slab protruded
from the south wal I in the lower two levels. Only 67 specimens of
I ithic debitage were recovered from the three and one-fourth levels
excavated in this test pit, most coming from the two 1/8 inch screened
levels of the northwest quadrant.
Table 23.1 shows the distribution of I ithic debitage by 1 meter
quadrants of the test pit. No tools were recovered from this unit.
Numbers in parentheses indicate the estimated number of pieces of
debitage that would have been recovered by 1/4 inch screen. As might

be expected, 24 of these 30 very smal I pieces are chips.
pieces were burned.
The relatively smal I amount of I ithic debitage
recovered, and the lack of any apparent cultural stratigraphy, do not
support the presence of an undisturbed cultural deposit. Debitage
from the test pit is included in the section on material culture.

Surface Collection
Before leaving the site, an additional surface collection was
conducted.
The primary purpose of this was to increase the sample of
debitage avai I able for comparison with other sites discussed in this
report (the 1980 surface collection was purposely biased toward tools
and larger debitage). Because of the patchy nature of erosion at the
site, no attempt was made to impose systematic patterns or rigid
designs upon unsystematical ly ordered, at least in cultural terms,
data.
The materials were collected within the "natural" clusters
formed by erosion. Although these clusters appear to be eroding out
of the surrounding sediments rather than being washed in from
somewhere else, it may be that they are previously redeposited
materials.
The choice of collection areas was based solely upon having a
reasonably adequate sample size present.
Collection areas were
generally smal I, usually no larger than 10 square meters. These areas
were searched thoroughly and al I visible material, including a number
of minute flakes - many that would pass through a 1/4 inch mesh screen
were collected and bagged separately, and the area located on the
plane table map of the site.
Seven such areas were collected at
41Hl109, six within the area previously defined as x41HI81 1 and a
single large area within the boundaries of the old x41Hl82.
The
locations of the materials collected in 1980 were plotted and, where
possible, included within a 1982 collection area.
The remainder of
the isolated single artifacts, including several collected on the
floodplain, were treated as general surface provenience.

41HI109
SITE STRATIGRAPHY
Profiles of the two backhoe trenches excavated along the slope
are shown in Fig. 23.3. The strata i I lustrated in the upper trench
(BHT 2) are thin and reflect primarily col luvial movement of materials
downslope, rather than in situ pedogenesis. Particularly along the
upper end of this trench,---rfie lower strata are
composed
of
yellowish-brown clays and gold-colored shales weathering out of the
Eagle Ford sediments that form the hi I Iside. Al I but the uppermost
strata in the upper portion of BHT 2 contain quantities of weathered
shale gravels derived from the bedrock beneath. Some si I icate gravels
are found in these strata. Downward toward the lower portion of BHT
2, the grain size of the sediment increases slightly and the quantity
of weathered shale decreases as the bedrock shales drop below the base
of the backhoe trench. Smal I chert gravels become more common in the
lower strata at this end of the trench.
Backhoe Trench 1 shows the increased thickness of the soi I strata
on the smal I alluvial/col luvial fan just above the base of the
hi I !side. Nearer the base of the slope, where the gradient lessens,
there appears to be an outwash fan development where the potential for
deposition and preservation of cultural material is greater.
These
smal I bench-I ike fan formations are present in a number of areas along
the hi I I sides that form the setting of 41HI109, 41HI110 and 41HI111,
and probably represent the most I ikely locations, other than the
floodplain at the base of the slope, for finding in situ cultural
remains.

was the location of this zone of thicker and apparently more stable
soi Is which finally decided the location of the 2 meter test unit
placed just north of BHT 1. This test pit, excavated to a depth of 40
centimeters, encountered slightly less soi I depth than suggested by
the BHT 1 profile. Profiles of the south and east wal Is of this unit

In the northern portion of this same unit, the texture of Stratum 2
changes radically, becoming a moderate, coarse granular brown clay.
Stratum 3 changes only slightly to the north, becoming darker in color
and with gray mottling replacing some of the yellow and red mottling.
These changes may be related to the erosional gully just west of the
excavation unit, or possibly to an earlier and now f i I led gully that
may have run south of the test pit.

MATERIAL CULTURE
Lithic Debris
Lithic debris was the only class of cultural material recovered
during the 1980 and 1982 investigations.
A smal I amount of fire
cracked chert and quartzite was recovered from the surface collection
units.
This amounted to 11 specimens weighing a total of only 103.7
grams. Because of the smal I sample and the lack of clear association
with the prehistoric cultural remains, this material is not considered
in subsequent analyses. With the exception of two quartzite cobbles
that show very slight end battering and may have been used briefly as
hammerstones, the lithic debris consists of flaked stone. In al I, 488
specimens of flaked stone (or 99.6% of the total artifacts) were
collected during the two seasons of work. Of the 488, 441 (90.4%)
were collected during the 1982 field season. Both of the possible
hammerstones were collected during the 1980 season, along with 47
specimens of flaked stone.
During 1980, 33 pieces of debitage - flakes and chips - (70.2% of
the sample) and 14 tools or formal tool blanks (29.8%) were collected
using a sample strategy oriented toward collection of potential
diagnostic markers or unique specimens. A larger and somewhat more
representative sample was obtained in 1982,
Al I surf icial cultural
materials, including flakes and chips that would pass through 1/4 inch
mesh, were collected from the eroded surfaces of the selected
collection units.
This group of artifacts included 425 pieces of
debitage (96.3%) and 16 flaked stone tools or blanks (3.6%).
Table
23.2 shows a breakdown of all the major categories by collection area
and excavation unit.
FLAKED STONE
Unmodified Debitage (458 specimens)
Unmodified debitage was collected in the 2 by 2 meter test pit
and from nine control led surface collection units. Collection Unit 1
and TP 1 were located within the area originally recorded as x41HI82,
while collection units 2 through 7 were along the banks of a gully in
the area originally recorded as x41HI81. As noted previously, where
possible, the 1980 materials were assigned to the appropriate 1982
collection units. The remainder of the 1980 materials and a few
isolated items from the 1982 collection were lumped into a general
surface provenience category.
This category primarily
contains
isolated finds of tools from the original SMU site x41HI81 and the
floodplain area.

Of the 458 specimens of debitage from the site, 425 (93.0%) are
from the 1982 field season and 33 (7.0%) were collected in 1980. The
1980 debitage included 21 flakes (63.6%) and 12 chips (36.4%).
In
1982, 235 flakes (55.3%), 187 chips (44.0%) and 3 cores (0.7%) were
collected.
FLAKES (256 specimens)
Of the 256 flakes collected from 41HI109, 235 (91.8%) were
collected in 1982 and 21 (8.2%) in 1980. This group includes 14
primary flakes (5.5%), 138 secondary flakes (53.9%) and 104 tertiary
flakes (40.6%).
Table 23.3 shows the breakdown of these classes by
collection unit.
Table V.1 shows the overal I distribution of flake types by
platform types.
As 1s generally the case, single facet platforms
predominate, making up 40.6% of the assemblage.
There is also no
apparent difference between the distribution of single and multiple
facet platforms among the secondary and tertiary flakes.
Table V.2
shows the distribution of ventral platform lips by flake type. The
overal I high number of I ipped flakes is due to analytical biases and
is difficult to compare with other sites, but as expected I ips are
slightly more common on tertiary flakes.
Table V.3 shows the overal I distribution of thermal alteration by
flake classes. There is no apparent correlation between flake classes
and burning. Table V.4 shows the distribution of material types by
flake classes.

percentage of quartzite debitage (11.3%) is relatively high compared
with most of the sites in the Aqui I la-Hackberry drainage but is not
surpr1s1ng, considering the large amounts of quartzite available in
the Uvalde gravel deposits on top of the hil I east of the sjte.
What
is somewhat interesting is the relative percentage decrease in
quartzite debitage at advanced stages of reduction (i.e., from 21.4%
quartzite primary flakes to 8.7% quartzite tertiary flakes). This may
be an indication of either a greater rejection rate of quartzite cores
at an early stage in the reduction process or the production of larger
tools from quartzite. Experiments with the quartzite avai I able near
41Hl109 have shown it to generally be a very difficult material to
work, making its rejection at an early stage probable. On the other
hand, the durability and strength of quartzite make it an ideal
material for the production of large heavy tools such as choppers,
that would leave a greater distribution of corticate flakes. A
Also, the
combination of both factors may be the best explanation.

tertiary flakes, the number of quartzite versus that of chert yields a
chi-square value of 1.37. This is not significant at even the 10%
level
of
probabi I ity
(Blalock 1972:569).
However, this same
distribution of quartzite materials is para I le led in the flake
categories from 41HI110, where a chi-square value significant at the
.01 level of probabi I ity is obtained (see next chapter).
Primary Flakes (14 specimens)
As shown above (Table 23.3), these 14 specimens represent 5.4% of
the total flake sample, among the highest percentages of primary
flakes recorded in this report. Although the total sample size is
small, this may be an indication that one of the activities conducted
was the initial reduction stages of stone tool manufacture.
No
primary flakes were collected in 1980 and none were recovered during
the excavation of TP 1 during 1982;
primary flakes were recovered
from five of the seven collection areas (see Table 23.3). There are
no apparent differences in the areal distribution of primary flakes
across the site.
By definition, al I of the primary flakes have cortex platforms
and only three (21.4%) have ventral platform I ips - one from CU 1 and
two from CU 4. Only one primary flake (CU 4) is burned.
Three
quartzite primary flakes (21.4%) were recovered - two from CU 1 and
one from CU 5.
Secondary Flakes (138 specimens)
Secondary flakes comprise 53.9% of the flakes collected from
41HI109.
Of the 138 flakes, 123 (89.1%) were collected in 1982. One
areal difference stands out. The two lowest percentages of secondary
flakes (from CU 1 and TP 1) are both from that portion of the site
originally recorded as x41HI82.
While the percentages of primary
flakes remain about the same at these two areas (5.2% at x41HI82 and
5.8% at x41HI81), the percentage of secondary flakes varies from 41.4%
at x41HI82 to 57.2% at x41HI81. Calculating a chi-square statistic on
this distribution (secondary vs. tertiary only) yields a value of 4.04
which is significant at p=.05 level with one degree of freedom
(Blalock 1972:569).
The actual significance of this distribution 1s skewed by
potential differences in collection method.
Use of 1/8 inch mesh
screen for one of the units in the test pit resulted in the collection
of a greater number of the usually smaller tertiary flakes; excluding
those from the test pit that would pass through 1/4 inch screen, which
probably more realistically estimates the thoroughness of the surface
collection techniques, leaves only seven secondary flakes (43.8%) and
23-15

41Hl109
nine tertiary flakes (56.2%).
While this percentage of secondary
flakes is sti I I low, calculation of a chi-square statistic only yields
a value of 2.36, not significant at the 5% level (Blalock 1972:569).
Differences between the two original sites are not supported by
the previously collected data either. Lynott and Peter (1977) report
a smaller percentage of secondary flakes on x41Hl82 (28%) than on
x41Hl81 (34%), but the difference really reflects an increase 1n
primary flakes at x41Hl82.
The percentage of tertiary flakes 1s
identical for both sites (57%) (Lynott and Peter 1977:72, 74).
The distribution of platform types among the various units for
secondary flakes is shown in Table V.5. In the three largest samples
(units 4, 5, 6) the percentages of cortex and single facet platforms
show similarly wide ranges (17.9 to 63.6% for cortex and 27.3 to 53.6%
for single facet), with collection units 5 and 6 covarying inversely.
Multiple facet platforms, accounting for a generally smal I portion of
the sample, exhibit correspondingly less variabi I ity, ranging between
9.1 and 21.4% in the larger samples. On the whole, multiple facet
platforms are found on only 17.4% of the secondary flakes at 41Hl109.
Ventral platform I ips are found on 72 (52.2%) of the secondary
flakes.
Table V.6 shows this distribution by units. Variation among
the units is great and there 1s no clear areal pattern to the
distribution
of
this variation.
There is a slightly greater
percentage of I ipped flakes found on the southern half (SMU x41Hl82),
where 75 % (15 specimens) of the secondary flakes with whole platforms
rema1n1ng are lipped (as opposed to 54.3% from x41HI81), but the
sample is smal I and the differences probably not significant.
Seventeen (12.3%) of the 138 secondary flakes are quartzite and a
single specimen (from CU 4) is quartz. The areal distribution of
these material types is not particularly revealing. The three larger
units (4, 5, 6) have relatively large percentages of non-chert
materials, ranging from 18.2% in CU 5 to 21.4% in CU 6. Half of the
rema1n1ng units have a single specimens of non-chert material, while
the other three units have none.
Seventeen (12.3%) of the secondary flakes have been burned.
Collection units 3 and 4 have relatively large percentages of burned
secondary flakes (41.7% and 22.2% respectively), while most of the
remaining units have either none or a single burned specimen. None of
the secondary flakes from the southern half of the site, including the
test pit, were burned.
Other than this, no obvious patterning is
observed in their distribution.

23-16

41HI109
Tertiary Flakes (104 specimens)
This group comprises 40.6% of al I flakes from the site. As noted
above, there is a significantly greater percentage of tertiary flakes
on the southern half (53.4% compared to 37.1% on the northern half),
but this difference is partly due to the additional tertiary flakes
collected from the 1/8 inch screened unit in the test pit.
In any
case, the total sample size is too smal I for a convincing argument of
real distributional differences.
Distribution of the various types of platforms by units is shown
in Table V.7.
The percentages of each type vary greatly. For the
site as a whole, single facet platforms are nearly twice as common as
multiple facet platforms among tertiary flakes (53.8% to 28.8%).
There is no difference between the northern and southern halves of the
site in distribution of these two platform types. The ratio of single
facet to multiple facet tertiary flakes for the whole site is 1.87:1;
for the northern half, the ratio is 1.91:1 and for the southern half,
2.00:1.
Seventy-one (68.3%) of the tertiary flakes are I ipped, 14 (13.5%)
have no I ips and another 19 (18.3%) were either indeterminate or had
crushed platforms. No clear distributional differences are observed
among the various units, and the northern and southern halves of the
site have similar I ipped to non-I ipped ratios. For the entire site,
the ratio of lipped to non-lipped tertiary flakes is 5.1:1. On the
northern half of the site, this ratio is 5.4:1, while on the southern
half it is 5.7:1.
Only nine (8.7%) of the tertiary flakes are of quartzite, the
only material other than chert in this particular group. Al I of the
units have a single quartzite specimen, with the exception of
collection units 4 and 5, which have two specimens and CU 6, which has
none. There are no differences between the northern and southern
halves of the site in tertiary flake material type distribution.
Fourteen (13.5%) of the tertiary flakes show evidence of burning.
Al I of the collection units have one or no specimens, with the
exception of collection units 4 and 7, which have three each.
In TP
1, five (35.7%) are burned.
Despite this, there are no apparent
differences in burned tertiary flakes between the northern and
southern halves of the site.
CHIPS (199 specimens)
This category includes 40.6% of al I the I ithic
specimens
collected from the site.
The ratio of flakes to chips among the
collection and excavation units generally varies from slightly greater
23-17

41HI109
than 1:1 (CU 3) to slightly greater than 2:1 (CU 5), with two
exceptions. These two include CU 7 1 where the ratio is slightly
greater than 3:1, and the excavation unit, where the chip to flake
ratio is greater than 2:1. In the latter case, the exclusion of those
specimens smaller than 1/4 inch, yields a flake to chip ratio of 16:21
or about 0.75:1, sti I I the lowest of al I the units.
No reasonable
explanation can be offered for either of these divergences except as
outliers of a normal distribution of flakes versus chips.
The distributions of thermal alteration and material type by unit
are shown in Table V.8. Twelve (6.0%) of all the chips are burned.
No areal differences are apparent, either by unit or between the
northern and southern halves of the site. Another twelve specimens
are quartzite, the only non-chert material found among the chips.
Distribution of material types by unit or by site area does not appear
to be significant.
CORES (3 specimens)
Three cores were collected from the surface of the northern
portion of the site during the 1982 investigations - two smal I core
fragments from Unit 6 and one tested cobble from Unit 7.
No cores
were collected in 1980, although two core tools were recovered. One
is described in the section on unifaces, while the other is bifacial
core chopper and described with the thick bifaces. Both specimens are
quartzite.
Unidirectional Cores (1 specimen)
This single large cobble of light grayish-purple, medium grain
quartzite (Ogallala?) has three flake scars along one lateral edge,
al I removed in the same direction from the natural cortex platform.
It is essentially what is described elsewhere as a tested cobble.
While the material itself looks suitable for tool manufacture, several
small fracture planes showing in the exposed flake scars may be the
reason for its abandonment. On the other hand, there is some evidence
of post-removal grinding or smoothing along the platform edge.
Although this smoothing may possibly be platform preparation for
subsequent flakes that were never removed, it may indicate use as a
tool. It may, in fact, be an example of the fine grained quartzite
tools described elsewhere in this report but, if so, the utilization
was not extensive and the evidence for including it in that category
is unconvincing.

23-18

41HI109
Core Fragments (2 specimens)
These two small mottled gray chert cores are
technically
multidimensional specimens, but, because of their smal I size, are
probably best described as core remnants or exhausted cores. Both are
characterized by numerous removal scars of varying sizes. Both have
some cortex present and both have a slight pinkish discoloration that
may be the result of thermal alteration, although it does not fit the
strict definition used in this report. Most discernible platforms are
single facet, but both have cortex platform removals as well.
Nibbling is present along one or more edges of both and one shows
signs of battering or grinding along one edge. In both cases, this
appears to be post-abandonment edge damage or casual
platform
preparation rather than use-wear. Both of these specimens are from CU
5.
Cores:

Discussion

Although a complete re-analysis of the cores collected by SMU was
not attempted, these specimens were inspected briefly.
The two
Ogal I ala quartzite and 13 chert cores are generally larger than those
described 1n this report, with examples of most of the basic core
types present.
This difference points to some of the sampling
problems inherent in surface collections, particularly from sites that
have been previously collected. It cannot be assumed, however, that
previous collections have depleted al I categories of cultural material
evenly, as the discovery of five 1982 projectile points contrasted to
SMU's single dart point would seem to indicate.
One conclusion that can be drawn from observation of the SMU
cores (but not the TAS core collection) is the presence of a
core-flake technology, i.e., tool manufacture on flake blanks struck
from cores rather than simple bifacial reduction of cobbles to form
tools. Despite this, there is little patterning obvious in the
removal technology, possibly a factor of the surface materials
representing combined cultural components. Additionally, most of the
flake removals are smal I, many of them seemingly unserviceable as
tools. The latter is primarily a function of the smal I size of cobble
blanks avai I able near the site.
Modified Debitage/Informal Tools (5 specimens)
A large number of specimens were originally identified as
modified debitage during the preliminary analysis of materials. A
more careful examination of these pieces showed them to have I ittle
more than random edge damage, such as one might expect to find 1n
materials on a steep, highly eroded and disturbed hi I I side.
A
23-19

41HI109
re-analysis returned al I questionable specimens to the unmodified
debitage category, leaving only five
with
relatively
certain
uti I ization.
In making this re-assessment, the lack of patterning of
suspected attrition, as wel I as other categories suggested by Mal louf
(1982) in his study of plow-damaged blades, were used as criteria for
rejection. A number of the types of edge damage I inked to plow damage
were found to be present. This is interesting since it is unlikely
that these relatively steep and eroded hi I I sides have ever been
plowed, although it is possible that they have been cleared for
pasture in historic times.
Although it is possible that some
plow-damaged artifacts may have migrated downslope, it is more I ikely
that other activities such as clearing, or even natural processes such
as animal tramp I ing or col luvial transport, have caused visually
similar damage.
TYPES 1 AND 2 ATTRITION (5 specimens, 7 facets)
Al I of the unquestionably modified debitage shows both Type 1 and
Type 2 attrition together.
Three of these five specimens were
collected in 1980 and the rema1n1ng two in 1982.
Four of the
specimens have one facet each, while a fifth has three individual
facets.
Formal Tools
UNIFACES (3 specimens)
Three
unifacial
tools
were
recovered
during
the
TAS
investigations at 41HI109.
One, a secondary chert flake, a general
surface find from north of the collection areas, has extensive steep
angled retouch and use-wear along the ventral surface of the distal
edge (Fig. 23.5a). A smal I amount of use-wear is also visible on one
lateral edge of the dorsal face immediately adjacent to the main
utilized edge.
This piece is considered a uniface rather than
modified debitage because the steep angle of the bit was apparently
created by intentional retouch rather than through use.
The working
edge of this piece is characterized primarily by smal I hinge fractures
perpendicular to the edge, suggesting use as a scraper.
The edge
itself shows a slight to moderate amount of smoothing or polish from
working a medium soft to medium hard material, possibly animal hide,
but more I ikely wood given that the edge is not heavily polished.
The second piece is the distal portion of a spurred or beaked end
scraper (Fig. 23.Sb) found in the floodplain area of the site. It is
considered a uniface rather than a modified chip because the spurs,
one
at
either side of the distal end, appear to have been
intentionally shaped by modification of the lateral edges.
These
23-20

41HI109

spurs do not show any apparent special use other than as part of the
primary working edge. This edge, the distal, exhibits extensive hinge
fracturing across its entire length on the dorsal face. The working
edge is not wel I smoothed and it seems probable that this face was
used in scraping a moderately hard material such as bone or soft wood.
Uti I ization is also apparent along the ventral face of one lateral
edge.
The last specimen 1s a large cobble of Ogal I ala quartzite that
superficially resembles a core and may have served that purpose prior
to its utilization. It has been extensively modified to create two
(possibly three) edges where the flake removal scars meet the slick
cortex surface, forming hard and relatively even unifacial cutting
surfaces.
Use-wear is a series of smal I hinge fractures along the
faceted surface. A few smal I flake scars can be seen on the cortex
surface but, even al lowing for the greater hardness of the natural
cortex surface, the wear can be classed as primarily unifacial.
This specimen is marked by a number of fracture planes and is not
suitable for blank production or further reduction into a formal tool.
Because of this obvious unsuitabi I ity and the relatively extensive
modification undertaken to create the existing edges, it is thought
that the hinge scars are use related and not
from
platform
preparation. In some ways this specimen is reminiscent of the heavily
battered Ogal I ala quartzite core-chopper tools found at many Aqui I la
sites, but it is neither bifacial nor is it worn so heavily. It may
have served a similar function, however, not being used as long or as
intensely.
In any case, it appears to be another example of the
efficient uti I ization of a material that is not particularly suitable
for the manufacture of most common stone tool types.
BIFACES (16 specimens)
Thick Bifaces (9 specimens)
Thick Bifacial Tools (1 specimen)
One of the specimens included here is a battered Ogal I ala
quartzite chopper.
As with some of the others of this type found in
the Aqui I la area, it may have served as a source for fine grain flake
blanks also, but the lack of any formal tools from this material
suggest that its primary function was as a chopper. Battering on this
specimen is not as heavy as on many and its form is only barely
bifacial, with cortex remaining on more than 50% of its surface.
Found by itself, it would probably be classed, in many areas, as a
core with extensive platform preparation.
Here, however, it 1s

As previously noted, the extreme hardness of this material is
suitable for heavy cutting, scraping (see the possible unifacial
example described in the previous subsection), or chopping of any
material.
Consequently, the heavily battered, smoothed and often
rounded edges indicative extensive use on some hard material (bone,
hardwood, or soft stone). Replication experiments by this author have
shown that such extensive rounding could not be achieved by pounding
the edge on another piece of quartzite for ten minutes. This
particular specimen has three (perhaps four) uti I ized edges, each with
varying degrees of wear.
The eight remaining specimens represent the pre I iminary I ithic
reduction stages of biface manufacture and include portions of what is
described elsewhere as core-bifaces, thick bifaces, roughouts and/or
blanks.
Because of the generally smal I size of the material they are
smaller than core-bi faces described from many other portions of the
state, and for the same reason, more amorphous than thick bifaces
described elsewhere. Al I are considered to be rejects rather than
finished tools.
These early stage bifaces can be further divided
(albeit somewhat subjectively) into two
groups
which
roughly
correspond to roughouts and blanks.
Roughouts (5 specimens)
The five roughout specimens are smal I, generally circular or
squarish, and thick for their size (width/thickness ratio ranging
between 1.4 and 2.1).
Al I have some amount of cortex and are
characterized by large, percussion flake scars. None have a wel I
formed bi facial edge. Al I are essentially complete and were probably
discarded because further reduction would have made them too smal I to
be usable. One piece, however, with I ittle cortex present and a
relatively wel I formed if sinuous edge, has smal I hinge scars along
the edge and may possibi ly have been uti I ized.
Blanks (3 specimens)
The three blank specimens are al I fragmentary but al I show a
tendancy toward I inearity (i.e., foliate or lanceolate shapes) rather
than the squarish shape of roughouts. They are narrower, thinner and
two have no cortex.
Width/thickness ratios of the two measurable
specimens are among the three highest values recorded here for
core-bi faces (2.1 and 2.2). Bifacial edges are slightly better formed
than in the above group.

23-23

41HI109
Thin Bifaces (7 specimens)
These specimens include those non-projectile point thin bi faces
that are often described elsewhere as preforms or knives. Four of the
seven specimens are fragmentary, including one basal, one distal and
two medial fragments as wel I as one specimen which lacks only a
portion of the base. Al I are manufactured from chert. One of the two
complete specimens is a grainy gold chert that may not be local
(Fig. 23.5c). The other comp!ete specimen (Fig. 23.5d) is a smal I,
wel I made, foliate shaped piece made from a banded or variegated
chert.
Al I of the specimens have generally wel I formed bifacial edges
and al I show some evidence of pressure flaking during manufacture.
Al I would be considered as belonging to the Preform II category.
Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the two whole specimens exhibit no
critical flaws that would prevent further reduction, yet have no clear
indication of uti I ization.
On the other hand, three fragments show
some signs of wear. The distal fragment shows bifacial hinge scars
along one lateral edge, apparently from a cutting or sawing action on
some moderately hard material. The basal fragment also shows slight
bifacial hinge fracturing combined with a smoothed or worn edge that
may have been caused by hafting or cutting some moderately soft
material.
The nearly complete specimen, which is not particularly
wel I worked and has a large lump along one edge, has unifacial hinge
fractures and edge smoothing along the lateral edge opposite the lump
(Fig. 23.5e). One medial fragment has a piano-convex cross section
and the other is a very wel I made lustrous gray midsection, probably
from a projectile point. Neither shows any trace of wear.
PROJECTILE POINTS (7 specimens)
Dart Points
Seven dart points were collected during all of the projects
undertaken at this site. Although this sample includes several smal I
thin specimens that could easily have functioned as arrow points, they
are al I generally thicker than is usual for arrow points (with the
possible exception of the barb fragment described below that is
difficult to classify), and are classed here as dart points. One of
these seven specimens was collected by SMU from x41HI82 and is not
included in other artifact tal I ies in this chapter, since no other
artifacts from that collection were included. The remaining six are
from the TAS investigations at the site - one from the 1980 season,
four from 1982 and one collected during the 1983 Management Data
Survey.

23-24

Forney (2 specimens)
Although this projectile point type, originally suggested by
Sol I berger (1969), has not found its way into general usage, it 1s
probably the best description of these two smal I specimens.
Another
option might be Dawson (after Prewitt 1974 and Duffield 1963), but it
is felt here that this type, if it is to have any useful diagnostic
value,
should probably be reserved for long, squarish stemmed
specimens that may date to the Late or Middle Archaic, or perhaps even
earlier. Although the diminutive size of I ithic resour~es in the area
partially negates the observations made for South Central Texas
concerning point size regression during the Archaic (Johnson, Suhm and
Tunnel I 1962), this trend seems to hold in a very general way for the
Central Brazos region.
Thus, these two smal I specimens may be
Transitional Archaic and could possibly have been early arrow point
experiments.
This late date fits wel I with Sol lberger's attempt to
separate out what he considered a relatively late, Wylie Focus type
projectile point. As uti I ized here it is felt that the type ought to
include smal I specimens with slight to moderately prominent shoulders
with para I lel stem edges and a rounded base.
These two smal I stemmed points do not clearly fit the typical
descriptions of arrow points, but are smal I for dart points. One
specimen is the only complete projectile recovered from 41HI109, a
smal I, squarish stemmed point with barbs flaring out perpendicular to
the blade (Fig. 23.5f). It is wel I enough made to suggest that it 1s
more than a preform.
This specimen, found in CU 10, is 4.2
centimeters in length, 2.0 centimeters in width and 0.6 centimeters in
thickness.
It is made from a white chert and has a small amount of
cortex present at the base of the stem, apparently the original
platform of the flake from which the specimen was manufactured.
The other Forney specimen, a smal I fragment missing the distal
portion, was found during the 1980 investigations in the approximate
area later collected as CU 7.
This specimen has weak rounded
shoulders and a slightly contracting, rounded stem (Fig. 23.5g). It
is made of white chert and has a portion of the cortex remaining on
one face
the dorsal surface of the flake from which it was
manufactured. Also like the point described above, it too has a
portion of the original platform at the base of the stem. Its width
1s 1.8 centimeters and its thickness is 0.7 centimeters.

Survey,
has
a
narrow, triangular, slightly
asymmetrical blade with prominent, almost barbed shoulders (one 1s
broken off) and a moderately expanding stem with a slightly convex
23-25

41HI109
base (Fig. 23.5h). The specimen is made from a brown chert with
several I ighter color inclusions. Base and stem edges are slightly
ground.
Miscellaneous Para I lel Stemmed (2 specimens)
This group includes two specimens which are quite diverse, one
from the SMU investigations and another from the 1982 collection. The
SMU projectile point, described by Lynott and Peter (1977) as
Bulverde-I ike, has a thin, para I lel sided, convex based stem with one
slightly barbed shoulder remaining and a smal I fragmentary blade that
has
apparently
been
reworked (Fig. 23.5i).
Thickness is 0.6
centimeters, stem width 1s 1.9 centimeters and stem length 1s
approximately
1.5
centimeters.
Although
it
exhibits
some
Bulverde-I ike stem characteristics, the base and lower portion of the
blade
are much thinner than is usual for this type and the
characteristic wedge shape base is not present (Suhm and Jelks 1962).
Although it shares some characteristics of that type, this specimen is
not considered to be Carrol Iton point, either.
The most complete specimen found in 1982 is a square stemmed
basal and medial fragment from CU 5. It is not wel I made, with cortex
along the remaining portion of one lateral edge, and may have been
broken during manufacture.
It shows no sign of utilization or
hafting. It is 2.4 centimeters 1n width and 0.8 centimeters 1n
thickness.
Miscellaneous Dart Point Fragments (2 specimens)
This group includes two specimens from the 1982 collections. The
first 1s a medial section broken on the stem just below the squarish
shoulders (Fig. 23.5j). It was found at the eastern edge of the
floodplain, in an area previously disturbed by plowing and bulldozing,
and west of most cultural materials. Edges are finished by alternate
beveling and the blade expands slightly upward from the shoulders.
Remaining maximum width is 3.0 centimeters and thickness is 0.8
centimeters. The second specimen is a barb fragment from a smal I dart
or large arrow point.
GROUND AND BATTERED STONE
Hammerstones (2 specimens)
Two poss i b Ie hammerstones were co 11 ected from the surface during
1980, both from the general area of CU 9. The larger of the two,
measuring 7.7 by 5.8 by 3.3 centimeters, has slight wear at one end
only while the other, measuring 5.7 by 5.4 by 2.8 centimeters, shows
slight battering in two smal I spots along the edge.

If these sites are truly I ithic workshop areas, the paucity of
hammerstones is somewhat surprising. This is emphasized by the fact
that neither of the hammerstones described above could have been used
more than a few times, if at al I. Large cobbles however, uti I ized or
not, were rare on the site surface.
Ceramics
Although no aboriginal ceramics were collected during the TAS
investigations, one sherd, collected during the 1972 SMU survey, is
described here. This smal I sherd has a large quantity of bone temper
fragments visible in the exterior surface. A smaller amount of temper
material is visible in the core and on the interior surface.
In
addition to this apparently intentionally added temper, the sherd
contains some sand size particles of quartz, smal I angular pieces of
chert and smal I rounded fragments of a gray, fine grained sandstone.
Exterior color is reddish-ye! low (7.5YR7/6) while the interior surface
is only slightly I ighter in color (7.5YR7.5/6). Thickness is 0.6
centimeters. Both the exterior and interior surfaces have been
smoothed by brushing.
The presence of aboriginal ceramics on a site with arrow points
is not particularly surpr1s1ng, but neither of the arrow points
collected here is a type ordinarily associated with ceramics, such as
are Alba and Perdiz, for example.
Additionally, if the site is
interpreted as primarily a lithic workshop, one might question the
presence of pottery.
SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The location of this site on a hi I I slope below I ithic procurement
site 41HI165 suggests that this was primarily a I ithic workshop area.
Although cores and thick bifaces are not extremely common, they are
present in sufficient quantity to add some support to this argument.
In addition, the percentages of primary and secondary flakes are
slightly higher than the average, suggesting that the earlier stages
of I ithic reduction were more common than at other sites 1n the
project area.
On the other hand, I ithic raw materials are rare if not absent on
the actual slope and one might wonder why reduction would not take
place at the procurement location on the hi I I top above the site.
Observations of surficial cultural materials at 41HI165 have shown
23-27

41Hl109
that some I ithic reduction did take place on the hi I I top, although
I ithic debris is generally much less dense, despite the fact that the
area is I ittered with cobbles.
The presence of a single ceramic sherd and several formal and
informal tools that show use-wear indicates that the site was used for
other types of activities in addition to I ithic reduction.
Although
the tools do not represent a particularly wide range of activities,
this may be a function of the relatively smal I sample of debitage.
Whether the size of the collection reflects actual density of
occupation or simply the degree of erosion and artifact exposure is
not certain, but the combination of the low density of surface
cultural materials on the extremely eroded northern section with the
low frequency of subsurface material on the southern half suggests
infrequent use of the site by the aboriginal inhabitants of the area.
Although no wel I dated diagnostic artifacts have been recovered,
the Godley specimen probably dates to the Transitional Archaic, and as
noted above, the two Forney specimens may also date to this period.
Actually, none of the projectile points, with the possible exception
of the Bulverde-like, thin broad stemmed specimen, can be convincingly
related to any period but the Transitional Archaic. On the other
hand, non-projectile point diagnostics may be taken to expand the
temporal range of occupations at the site. The single ceramic sherd,
which shows greater affinities to Leon ~ and untyped varieties
collected from the surface at nearby 41HI111 than to pottery from the
McDonald Site only a few hundred meters to the northwest, dates at
least one occupation to the Late Prehistoric Period.
This I imited period of site use may be a function of diagnostic
sample size.
Adjacent hi I I side sites to the south (41HI110 and
41HI111), in similar environmental settings, show evidence of earlier
occupations during the Archaic and perhaps even during the Late
Paleoindian Period (depending on whether Angostura 1s considered a
It is possible,
Late Paleoindian or Early Archaic diagnostic).
however, that site occupation was contingent on a channel of Hackberry
Creek having migrated near the edge of the upland slope. At least one
channel scar is visible halfway between the modern channel and the
site.
Variable channel location may also account for the lowered
density of aboriginal occupation at the McDonald Site immediately
prior to the Late Prehistoric Period.
If the site were truly restricted to a Transitional Archaic
component, it would be important since this period is poorly known
from this area and seems to be distinct from the Central Texas
Transitional Archaic. Unfortunately, al I evidence points to the site
being primarily surficial. What little subsurface material has been
found 1s not in a convincingly undisturbed context. The possibility
23-28

41HI109
that the site extends undisturbed into the floodplain, as at
must be considered.

SITE DESCRIPTION
This site is on the eastern edge of the Hackberry Creek
floodplain (Fig. 24.1) south of 41HI109 and about 2.2 kilometers
northeast of the confluence of Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks.
Like
41HI109, this site extends from the floodplain onto the middle slopes
of the valley wal I of the creek, from about 158.5 meters to 169.2
meters (519
555 ft.) MSL (Fig. 24.2). At its closest point, the
site is only about 100 meters east of Hackberry Creek.
The greatest
concentration of cultural material I ies within an area approximately
150 meters in diameter with a very light scatter of material extending
west and north of this in the floodplain area. As noted in the
chapter on 41HI109, there is I ittle clear distinction between these
two sites on the floodplain, while the areas of greatest concentration
on the slopes are separated by nearly 200 meters.
Cultural materials are found on the slopes of the hil I and on
several benches along the slope that appear to be of mixed erosional
and col luvial origin.
As at 41HI109, the sediments forming the
hi I I side are thought to be Woodbine Formation shales and sandstones.
Although cultural materials extend somewhat higher up the slopes here
than they do at 41HI109, they sti I I do not extend onto the Lake Waco
Formation sediments that cap the hi I I.
The lower and gentler portions of the slope combine alluvial fan
deposits with a smal I segment of Hackberry Creek terrace, recognized
in an excavation profile for the Hi I lsboro Water Supply intake
structure.
Beyond this to the west is the floodplain of the creek.
In addition to the modern and fossi I floodplains of Hackberry Creek,
there are smal I areas of alluvial deposits along the small, ordinarily
dry tributary that borders the site to the south and divides it from
41HI111.

The slopes at the site are mapped as Normangee clay loam with

montmori I lonitic, thermic Vertie Haplustalf is thought to have formed
in alkaline marine sediments on uplands (Brooks 1978:66). A typical
profile of this soil shows 13 centimeters of pale brown clay loam Ap
horizon overlying up to 138 centimeters of yellow to yellowish-brown
clay.
In several areas this soi I has
been
heavily
eroded,
particularly in the southern portion of the site (old SMU x41Hl85)
where severe gully erosion has stripped the original soi I to a depth
of more than a meter.
Soi I in the floodplain area is mapped as Tinn clay, a fine,
montmori I lonitic, thermic Vertie Haplaquol I. These deep, calcareous,
clayey soi Is have a typical profile consisting of up 150 centimeters
of very dark gray clay A horizon over mottled olive gray and yellow
clay C horizon. A more detailed description of a typical profile of
floodplain alluvium and its potential for archeological remains can be
found in the chapter discussing the McDonald Site (41HI105).
Al I of the floodplain and parts of the terrace and upland slope
had been cleared and plowed prior to the TAS investigations, but were
heavily overgrown. Subsequent to the 1982 work, a large portion of
the site was bulldozed during reservoir clearing. As noted above, the
slopes have been severely eroded in places. A dirt road and field
terrace construction have disturbed the site at the base of the slope.
Construction of the Hi I lsboro Water Supply intake structure has also
destroyed extensive portions. In effect, the greater portion of the
site lying below the 537.5 foot conservation pool level has been
totally destroyed. Only areas which might be buried in the floodplain
are I ikely to have escaped destruction. A smal I part of the site
lying above the conservation pool level may have survived relatively
intact.
SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK
This site was initially recorded as three distinct sites by the
original SMU survey (Skinner and Henderson 1972). The northernmost of
these three, x41HI83, is reported as a "smal I ... area of I ithic
debris" assigned to the Late Archaic Period (Skinner and Henderson
1972:24). The middle site, x41HI84, is described as a "scattered area
with lithic debris" dated to the Late Prehistoric Period. The
southernmost site, which borders the small dry tributary,
was
originally designated as x41HI85 and described as a "dense area of
I ithic debris, projectiles, ground stone" that included diagnostics of
the Paleoindian and Late Archaic periods. Relatively large surface
collections were made at the two northern sites while only two
24-4

41HI110
artifacts, presumably projectile points, were collected from x41HI85.
One of these two artifacts, identified as an Angostura point, is
i I lustrated in Skinner and Henderson (1972:45).
Lynott and Peter (1977) conducted investigations at al I three SMU
sites in 1975. At x41HI83 several posthole tests (six are indicated
on the map) revealed sterile reddish clay and bedrock just beneath the
surface.
Three 10 by 30 meter areas were surface collected, yielding
663 specimens of lithic debris. They suggest that the site has been
def lated. At x41HI84, four posthole tests encountered sterile reddish
clay within 10 centimeters of the surface. Three 10 by 25 meter areas
were surface collected, yielding only 48 specimens of lithic debris.
At the southernmost of these three sites, x41HI85, two postholes again
revealed sterile red clays near the surface. As at x41HI83, surface
collection was conducted in three 10 by 30 meter areas, yielding 343
specimens.
Interpretations by Lynott and Peter (1977) of the function of
these sites is similarly inconclusive in all three cases. Within
their Restricted Wanderer model, each could be regarded as a foraging
station on the basis of artifact density, or a seasonal reoccupation
camp on the basis of tool variety (Lynott and Peter 1977:82,84,90).
Projectile
points
collected
at
x41HI83 suggested Middle and
Transitional Archaic occupations. At x41HI84, Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric occupations are indicated by diagnostic projectile points.
Intermittent occupations from the Paleoindian through Late Archaic are
suggested for x41HI85.
DATA COLLECTION
As noted in the chapter on 41HI109, previous questions had been
raised about the archeological significance of the hi I I side sites
(x41HI81 through x41HI85) southeast of the McDonald Site (41HI105).
Investigations were undertaken by TAS to determine their potential
National Register eligibility and to understand their function within
the local context.
A pre I iminary search for the three SMU sites (x41HI83, x41HI84,
x41HI85) south of 41HI109 easily identified the badly eroded x41HI85
and found it to extend northward as far as the recorded locations of
x41HI83 and x41HI84, with little separation between the areas of
concentration. During the initial TAS assessment, it was determined
that the separation between these sites was based partially on density
of surface exposure as a factor of erosion and not clearly culturally
relevant.
This and the fact that the three sites are apparently
connected by a light scatter of I ithic debris, led to their being
combined into a single site for future investigations. Interpretation
of the boundaries of sites is often a subjective pursuit and depends
24-5

41HI110
to a large degree on the definition of a site. For many analyses, the
original SMU site definitions are the proper level of definition.
On
the other hand, for the type of broad perspective implied in the
technological analysis of materials reported here, it might be more
useful to consider al I of 41HI109, 41HI110 and 41HI111 as a single
large site. Rather than further complicate their already somewhat
tangled history however, they have been analyzed here just as recorded
by Watson in 1980.
1980 TAS Investigations
During the 1980 investigations, the primary goal was to assess
the size and function of these hi I I side sites and to determine if
subsurface cultural materials were present. Size and function were
initially determined by examination of the remaining surface materials
(after the earlier SMU collections). Potentially diagnostic artifacts
found on the surface were mapped and collected. In order to determine
the subsurface potential, two 50 by 50 centimeter shovel tests, 50 and
40 centimeters deep, were excavated in the area previously designated
as x41HI84. Five specimens of lithic debitage were recovered from
Shovel Test 1 and two from Shovel Test 2. In both cases, this
material was recovered from between 30 and 35 centimeters below the
ground surface.
It was not clear from these smal I tests whether the
material was in primary context or had been redeposited from higher up
the slope.
1982 TAS Investigations
During the 45 work days expended by TAS from March to May, 1982,
two goals were set for investigations at the site. The first was the
excavation of control led test units in the bench and fan areas to
determine if the cultural material encountered in the 1980 shovel
tests could be related to undisturbed buried occupation surfaces. The
second goal was the collection of surficial cultural debris in the
areas that would be destroyed by reservoir clearing. It was thought
by both Watson and Brown in 1980 and 1982 that this site, as well as
41HI109 and 41HI111, was an important I ithic reduction area related to
the adjacent hi I I top resource procurement site, 41HI165. Therefore it
was believed that a large collection of I ithic materials could be
usefully compared to lithic debris from floodplain sites such as the
McDonald Site, where I ithic resources are not so readily available.
TEST PIT 1
During the 1982 investigations two 2 by 2 meter test pits were
excavated. The first was placed in the area of SMU x41HI85 on a bench
This flat bench
between the gul I ied area and the smal I tributary.
overlooking the floodplain was chosen not only because of its
24-6

41HI110
excel lent potential as a campsite location, but also because it was
one of the few uneroded areas left at x41HI85. The test unit was
staked out along an approximate north-south axis and taken down in 15
centimeter levels.
Al I of the excavated matrix was dry screened
through 1/4 inch mesh and al I cultural materials saved. Three levels
were excavated from the entire unit, maintaining separate one meter
quadrant provenience, to a depth of 45 centimeters below the surface.
A marked decrease in cultural material was noted in level 3. Two
more levels, to a maximum depth of 75 centimeters below the surface,
were excavated in the northwest 1 meter quadrant only, yielding almost
no cultural material. Table 24.1 shows the distribution of al I flaked
stone materials which constituted al I the artifactual material from
this unit, in TP 1. This includes both flakes and chips (200 flakes
and 188 chips whose distribution is approximately para I lel) and two
bi faces (one each from the northeastern quadrants of levels 2 and 3).
It can be seen that there is essentially one level of cultural
material
in
the
unit.
This distribution is matched by the
distribution of fire cracked rock identified only from level 2.
Five
specimens of fire cracked rock were recovered from the unit, three
(49.5 g) from the northwest 1 meter quadrant, one (22.6 g) from the
northeast and one (15.5 g) from the southwest. These five specimens
have I ittle interpretive value, however. The cultural level shows up
in level 3 rather than level 2 in the southeastern quadrant, the
highest original ground surface in the unit. This suggests that the
slope of the modern ground surface is different than the slope of the
surface on which the cultural materials were deposited.
A more
detailed description of these cultural materials is included in the
Material Culture section of this chapter.
In addition to artifacts, gravels were saved from the northwest
quad in levels 3 through 5. These gravels, mostly pebbles less than 2
centimeters in diameter and derived from both shale and sandstone,
were numerous in the third level above the reddish-orange clay that
formed the matrix of the lower two levels. Although they were much
more numerous 1n level 3 than in levels 1 and 2, unfortunately no
gravies were saved from those units. Further discussion of this 1s
included 1n the section on stratigraphy at the site.
TEST PIT 2
Subsequent to excavation of the first test pit, a second 2 by 2
meter test unit was placed on a smal I grassy bench 100 meters north of
the first. The location of this unit was determined after subsurface
cultural materials were observed in a backhoe trench excavated on the
northern edge of this bench.

This test pit was taken down to 90 centimeters below the surface
in ten centimeter levels. Because of a slight westward slope, level 1
was excavated only in the two eastern 1 meter quadrants.
At the
bottom of the unit, level 9 was only excavated in the two western 1
clay
meter quadrants, fol lowing the slope of the dense basal
underlying the bench.
Due to the clayey nature of the soi Is
throughout this unit, al I of the excavated matrix below level 1 was
water screened while level 1 was dry screened. At the suggestion of
Robert Burton, Army Corps of Engineers staff archeologist, one of the

level 1 and from al I of the water screened levels.

Table 24.2 shows the overal I distribution of artifacts in this
unit. This material includes 182 flakes, 128 chips, two cores (1 each
from levels 3 and 8), one uniface (from level 8), four bifaces (2 from
level 4, and 1 each from levels 5 and 6), one projectile point (from
level 3) and a hammerstone (from level 6). Not included in this tally
are two pieces of barbed wire found in the lower levels of the unit.
Since they were found in the water screen and not in place in the
unit, it is difficult to interpret their significance. The apparently
I ittle disturbed stratigraphy and the lack of other historic artifacts
suggests that they may be intrusive in one way or another.
Eighty-three specimens off ire cracked rock were recovered from
various levels of TP 2. Table 24.3 shows the distribution of this
material. Comparison of this data with the distribution of I ithic
debris shown in Table 24.1 reveals some interesting differences. The
two most striking differences are in levels 5 and 6.
The general
increase in cultural material is para I leled by an increase in fire
cracked rock in levels 1 through 4. The decrease in cultural material
in level 5, however, is matched by a corresponding increase in fire
cracked rock, primarily the result of several larger rocks in the
northeast quadrant.
In the next level down, an increase in cultural
material is matched by a sharp decrease in fire cracked rock.
A quadrant by quadrant correlation between fire cracked rock
weight and number of items of cultural debris, yields a correlation
coefficient (R) of .269, not significant at the p=.05 level of
significance (Nie et al. 1975). Fire cracked rock does not correlate
wel I with pebbles from the test units either, yielding a correlation
coefficient value of .244, also not significant at the p=.05 level.
Interestingly, the total number of I ithic debris correlates relatively
wel I with the pebble count from these quadrants, with a correlation
coefficient of .782, significant at p=.00001 level. This latter fact
can be interpreted in one of several ways. First, the pebbles are
taken as an indication of more intensive colluvial activity, and the
para I lel increase in I ithic debris may be related to transport of
smaller materials downslope. On the other hand, the pebbles may
indicate a long stable ground surface on which numerous bits of
cultural debris accumulated.
Surface Collection
After the test unit excavations, a semi-control led surface
collection was undertaken to increase the sample of I ithic debitage.
This sample was taken from areas scheduled to be bul I dozed for
reservoir vegetation clearing soon after the archeological work was
completed. As at 41HI109, the purpose of this collection was to
acquire a large representative sample of debitage to facilitate
technological comparisons with other sites. Collection methodology at

41HI110 was essentially identical to that described.for 41HI109 and in
the chapter on Data Collection.
Because mater~als .were ~xposed
primarily by erosion, "natural" clusters were arb1trar1 ly defined as
collection units.

Criteria for the definition of a collection unit was primarily
adequate sample size, as at 41HI109, although several smal I clusters
of tools or potentially diagnostic artifacts were mapped and collected
separately.
Twenty collection units were mapped during the 1982
investigations. Most of these have extremely smal I sample sizes and
are not particularly useful for intrasite comparative purposes. For
this reason, only the eight units which have total sample numbers
greater than 30 specimens are included in the tables as separate
units.
The remaining units are lumped
into
general
surface

24-11

41Hl110
To preserve any large scale spatial relationships among
provenience.
the data, this lumped category is divided into two groups, one
including eight smal I units on the southern end of the site (x41Hl85)
representing 79 I ithic artifacts from 1982, and the other combining
four units to the north (x41Hl83-84) with 59 I ithic artifacts from the
1982 collection. Uni ike the surface collection at 41Hl109, the 32
1980 units could not be easily superimposed upon the 1982 units.
Because they are generally smal I samples, they have also been included
with these general surface provenience units, 12 of the units with the
northern group and 20 in the south.
These divisions leave a surface
collection
with
groups
represented by large sample sizes, maintaining the large scale
division between the gross areas of the site. This bipartite division
is conveniently matched by a 2 by 2 meter test unit in each section,
but for most purposes it may be better to divide the surface
collection units into three areas, with units 4, 5 and 6 falling in a
middle area that is lower, flatter and closer to the tributary creek
and to the floodplain, than either the north or south areas.
Fortunately, this division is simplified by the lack of any smal I
sample size units in this area, thus eliminating the need for a third
general surface category.
The location of al I of the
larger
collection units is shown in Figure 24.2.
SITE STRATIGRAPHY
Five backhoe trenches were excavated along the hi I I side where
41HI109 and 41HI110 are located. Two of these trenches were on the
slope at 41Hl109 and are described 1n that section.
The three
rema1n1ng trenches were placed on or adjacent to 41Hl110. BHT A was
placed on a flat grassy bench north of the area of visible cultural
materials (Fig. 24.2).
A profile of this trench is shown in Figure
24.3. The strata showed decreasing grain size from the pale brown
sand Al horizon at the top to a brown clay at the bottom. Strata
boundaries were smooth, varying between clear and
gradual
in
definition.
Every strata but the uppermost had orange and red
concretions present. As in many of the strata defined in these
hi I I side trenches, there was a downhi I I increase in thickness. In
addition, Stratum 3 appeared just above midway in the trench and
continued to thicken as Stratum 4 dropped out of sight. Stratum 3 may
be the upper edge of one of the many smal I alluvial or col luvial fans
observed along the length of the hi I I side. This trench yielded no
cultural material nor suggested a preserved paleosurface.
BHT B was located about 70 meters south of BHT A on a flat bench
1n a smal I clearing just north of where a quantity of I ithic debitage
was observed in eroded shallow gullies. Isolated specimens of debris

were also observed on the surface north of the trench. A profile of
this trench is shown in Figure 24.3. The four strata observed were
al I clays, proceeding downward from a crumbly red and gray mottled
clay to a dark gray platy, micaceous clay at the bottom.
This lower
stratum was banded by yellow and red concretions in a dark red clay
matrix forming the gravel layers i I lustrated in the profile.
Smal I
rocks and concretions were present throughout the lower strata. The
variable thicknesses of these strata and the omnipresent gravels
support the primary col luvial origins of the upper portion of this
sediment and suggest potentially extensive reworking of any cultural
materials that might be buried here. No such materials were observed
in this trench, however. BHT C, some 70 meters south of BHT B, was
also located on a flat grassy bench at the northern end of the site,
and just to the south of the same eroded area with a high density of
visible surface materials mentioned above. One of the two 1980 shovel
tests that had yielded one tertiary flake and one chip, was located
just north of the eastern end of this trench. Its stratigraphy is
shown in Figure 24.3. This trench showed 10 to 50 centimeters of dark
yellowish-brown (10YR4/4) (clay?) loam over a very compact hard
grayish-brown (lOYRS/2) sandy clay with red, yellow and strong brown
mottling, partly derived from weathered fragments of shale and
sandstone. The boundary between these two zones is wavy and varies
between clear and abrupt. One flake and two chips were recovered from
the backdirt.
Just a few meters to the north, the general stratigraphy seen 1n
this backhoe trench was refined in the definition of soi I strata 1n TP
2. Five strata were identified in the final profiles of this unit
(Fig. 24.4), the upper four are finer subdivisions of the upper
backhoe trench stratum. These strata are described below.

MATERIAL CULTURE
Lithic Debris
With the exception of a few mussel shel I fragments, lithic debris
was the only cultural material collected during the 1980 and 1982 TAS
investigations at this site. A total of 2210 specimens was collected
which includes 164 fire fractured chert and quartzite. These fire
fractured specimens, total I ing 3656.8 grams, include 76 specimens from
the collection units and 88 from the 2 by 2 meter test units. Al I but
five of these latter 88 are from TP 2 and are discussed in greater
detai I in the section on that unit. The 76 specimens found on the
surface are from disturbed and eroded contexts and their association
with the aboriginal occupants of the site is uncertain. None of the
specimens of fire cracked rock is included in I ithic artifact tables.
Of the rema1n1ng 2046 specimens, 2027 are flaked stone and 19 are
battered stone.
Table 24.4 shows the distribution of general types of I ithic
debris among the various surface collection and excavation units. See
the above section on the 1982 surface collection for a discussion of
the surface collection areas uti I ized in tables throughout this
section. A total of 154 specimens, including 126 pieces of I ithic
debitage, 27 tools and 1 piece of battered stone, was recovered during
the 1980 TAS investigations. Uni ike the situation at 41HI109, these
specimens could not be clearly grouped with 1982 collection units and
are included here as general surface along with three specimens of
debitage from the 1982 backhoe trench and two bifaces not assigned
specific proveniences. In 1982, 1892 I ithic specimens were collected,
including 1816 debitage, 57 tools and 18 pieces of ground or battered
stone.
Of the total 2027 specimens of flaked stone collected in 1980 and
1982, 1942 (95.9%) are debitage and 84 (4.1~) are tools. The 153
specimens of flaked stone from the 1980 collection include 126
debitage (82.4~) and 27 tools (17.6%), while the 1874 specimens from
1982 include 1816 debitage (97.0%) and 57 tools (3.0%).
The 1980
figures show the amount of potential bias possible in controlled
surface collection, while the 1982 figures for tools may be somewhat
deflated by the intensity of previous archeological collections.

FLAKED STONE
Unmodified Debitage (1942 specimens)
Unmodified debitage was collected from both test pits and all
collection units, with the exception of CU 2. Of the 1816 specimens
collected in 1982 (93.5% of the total debitage), 388 are from TP 1,
303 are from TP 2 and the remaining 1109 are from the surface of the
site, with the exception of 1 flake and 2 chips found in the backdirt
of the backhoe trench.
As Table 24.4 shows, al I of the test pit
debitage is flakes and chips, with the exception of two cores from TP
2.

The 126 specimens of 1980 debitage break down into 71 flakes
(56.3% of the 1980 debitage), 47 chips (37.3%) and 8 cores (6.3%),
while the 1816 specimens from 1982 are divided into 1076 flakes
(59.3%), 722 chips (39.8%) and 18 cores (0.9%). In both cases, the
ratio of flakes to chips is similar (1980 = 1.59:1;
1982 = 1.49:1)
with the more highly visible cores being overly represented in 1980.
The total debitage sample of 1942 specimens is broken down into 1149
flakes (59.2%), 768 chips (39.5%) and 25 cores (1.2%).
FLAKES (1149 specimens)
As noted above, the collection off lakes includes 73 specimens
from 1980 and 1076 specimens from 1982. The 1980 collection yielded
no primary flakes, 45 secondary flakes (61.6%) and 28 tertiary flakes
(38.4%).
The 1982 collection was divided into 57 primary flakes
(5.3%), 597 secondary flakes (55.5%) and 422 tertiary flakes (39.2%).
Despite the lack of primary flakes, the close correspondence between
corticate and decorticate percentages between seasons suggests that
there was I ittle bias in the 1980 collection of flakes. The breakdown
of the total sample off lakes and their distribution is shown in Table
24.5.
This total sample includes 57 primary flakes (5.0%), 642
secondary flakes (55.9%) and 450 tertiary flakes (39.2%).
Table V.9 shows the distribution of platform preparation by flake
type at 41HI110.
Single facet platforms predominate among both
secondary and tertiary flakes, occurring in 37.6% of al I cases. There
are no apparent differences in distribution of single facet versus
multiple facet platform types among the secondary and tertiary flakes.
There is a slightly larger percentage of multiple facet platform
uti I ization at 41HI110 (26.3%) as opposed to its sister site on the
hillside to the north, 41HI109 (21.3%). When compared to the combined
totals of cortex and single facet platforms (both larger at 41HI109
see Tables 23.4 and V.9), a chi-square value of 3.0 is calculated for
the 2 by 2 table. With only one degree of freedom, this value is not

Table V.10 shows the distribution of ventral platform I ips by
flake type.
The high percentage of I ipped flakes is a factor of
analytical bias and not a real distributional difference. This table
indicates that the distribution of I ipped flakes at 41HI110 is almost
identical to that found at 41HI109 (see Table V.2), being most common
among tertiary flakes.
Table V.11 shows the overal I distribution of thermal alteration
by flake type.
On the whole, thermal alteration is less common at
41HI110 (8.0%) than it is at 41HI109 (12.6%) .. This difference
crosscuts al I three flake type categories. Oddly enough, the reverse
holds among chips, a larger percentage of chips is burned at 41HI110 see tables V.8 and V.21. Given the relatively smal I collection from
41HI109 and the very smal I total number of burned specimens from that
site (32), it seems I ikely that this difference may be due to sampling
error rather than cultural factors.
Table V.12 shows the distribution of material types by flake type
category at 41HI110.
This distribution is nearly identical to that
found at 41HI109, with a relatively high percentage of quartzite
flakes
in al I categories (11.7%) and decreasing percentage of
quartzite debitage with reduction stage. This may indicate either a
greater rejection rate for quartzite cores or the production of larger
tools from quartzite. The whole of Table V.12 yields a chi-square
value of 17.59, significant at the .007 level with 6 degrees of

freedom (Blalock 1972:569).
(primary and secondary) flakes versus the decorticate (tertiary)
flakes, the distribution of chert versus quartzite yields a chi-square
value of 10.55, significant at the .01 level with one degree of
freedom (Blalock 1972:569) The value is very nearly significant at the
.001 level).
Primary Flakes (57 specimens)
These 57 specimens represent 5.0% of the total flake sample, one
of the higher percentages of primary flakes in this report, and
identical to that from 41HI109, the site immediately adjacent to the
north.
As pointed out there, this is taken to be an indication that
the initial stages of I ithic reduction were an important activity.
The distribution of these specimens is shown in Table 24.5. No
primary flakes were collected during the 1980 season, despite the fact
that a total of 71 flakes were collected then; al I other collection
units with more than 30 flakes yielded at least one primary flake.
Only 12 primary flakes (21.1% of al I the primary flakes) were
recovered in the test pits, which accounted for 33.9% of al I flakes.
24-21

41HI110

Because of the smal I total number of primary flakes, it is
difficult to determine the validity of any distributional differences
in the sample. It can be noted however, that for the four samples
with more than 100 flakes (collection units 4 and 7, test pits 1 and
2), both of the northernmost units (CU 7 and TP 2 - about 25 meters
apart) have nearly identical percentages of primary flakes (Table
24.5). The two southernmost units (CU 4 and TP 1), separated by 75
meters distance and nearly 5 meters in elevation, are the most
divergent, ranging from 1.5 to 9.4% primary flakes. The difference is
in secondary flakes since both of these latter units have similar
percentages of tertiary flakes.
Al I primary flakes have cortex platforms by definition and 15
(26.3%) have ventral platform I ips, one each from collection units 5,
8 and TP 2, two each from CU 2 and from the general surface of the
southern portion of the site, three from CU 7 and five from CU 4.
Three primary flakes were burned, one from CU 6 and two from TP 2.
Ten of the 57 specimens were quartzite (17.5%), including one specimen
each from collection units 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, TP 2 and both general
surface area units, with two specimens from CU 4. These samples are
al I too smal I to make any distributional inferences.
Secondary Flakes (642 specimens)
Secondary flakes comprise 55.9% of al I the flakes recovered from
41HI110, a figure just two percent higher than that from 41HI109. Of
the 642 total specimens, 45 (7.0%) were collected in 1980 and the
rema1n1ng 597 in 1982. A total of 203 (34.0% of the 1982 secondary
flakes) were recovered in the two test pits (see Table 24.5).
Using
only the totals from the largest collections as in the discussion of
primary flake distribution above, there is I ittle apparent patterning
in distribution.
The two northernmost large units, CU 7 and TP 2,
have disparate percentages of secondary flakes (59.5% and 48.9%
respectively), despite their relative proximity. This disparity is
echoed in the secondary flakes percentages for the southernmost large
units, CU 4 and TP 1. In the case of CU 4, the lower percentage of
secondary flakes (47.5% - the lowest of any large unit) correlates
inversely with the high percentage of primary flakes (9.4% - the
greatest of any large unit).
Table V.13 shows the distribution of platform types among the
various units for secondary flakes.
Again, using only the larger
units, some possible distributional patterns emerge. Cortex platforms
predominate to the north, with single facet platform preparation more
common to the south. Little patterning is evident in the distribution
of multiple facet platforms, except that the percentages are very
24-22

41HI110
similar between the two test pits. Also noted here is that the two
northernmost
large
units, 25 meters apart, have very similar
percentages in al I categories, while the southernmost units, more
distant from each other, have a wider range of values.
The higher percentage of single facet platforms to the north
suggests an area where secondary stage core reduction or production of
larger coarse bifaces took place.
The moderate number of primary
flakes and the low frequency of cortex platforms in these two units
supports this hypothesis. To the south, initial reduction 1s more
common, particularly at CU 4 where a high number of primary flakes is
matched by a relatively high number of cortex platforms on secondary
flakes.
Also, this unit has the lowest percentage of crushed
platforms of any of the large units, somewhat surpr1s1ng for an
initial reduction area.
Up the hi I I at TP 1 1s found the highest percentage of cortex
platforms in any large sample unit. This high percentage can be seen
as slightly contradictory to the data showing a low frequency of
primary flakes in this area, or it can be combined to present a
Combining al I the cortex platforms
somewhat different picture.
(primary and secondary flakes with cortex platforms) in these two
areas, a much more comparable figure appears. Collection Unit 4 has
42 flakes (26.3%) with cortex platforms and TP 1 has 53 flakes (26.5~)
with cortex platforms. In any case, an earlier stage of reduction
appears more common on the southern half of the site, the area
initially recorded by SMU as x41HI85.
Comparison of platform type percentages with 41Hl109 (see Table
V.5) indicate that cortex platforms are less common and multiple facet
platforms more common here than at 41HI109. This suggests a greater
amount of finer biface reduction and less primary core reduction at
41HI110 than at 41HI109. This is supported indirectly, albeit with
smal I sample sizes, by the ratio of thick to thin bi faces found at
these two sites. At 41HI109, the thick-thin ratio is 1.33:1, while at
41HI110, the ratio is only 0.81:1.
The distribution of ventral platform lips on secondary flakes 1s
shown in Table V.14.
This indicates that 57.6~ of the secondary
flakes are lipped (note again that lip figures are inflated through
analytical
bias),
a
slightly higher figure than at 41HI109.
Conversely, uni ipped secondary flakes comprise 34.0% of the sample,
lower than at 41HI109. If this can be taken to indicate the greater
use of soft hammer or bi I let percussion at 41HI110, then it supports
the conclusion of emphasis on the middle and latter stages of the
reduction process at 41HI110. No inferences can be drawn from the
intrasite distribution patterns of lipping.

24-23

41HI110
Material type distribution for secondary flakes is shown in Table
V.15.
Fourteen percent of al I the secondary flakes are quartzite and
only four flakes (0.6%) are quartz at 41HI110. This figure is just
slightly higher than that for quartzite at 41Hl109 (12.4%). Both of
the surface collection units have similar percentages slightly below
that of the overal I average (CU 4=11.8%; CU 7=11.5%), while the two
test pits have higher figures. TP 1 is identical to the overal I
average, while TP 2 has a somewhat higher figure (19.1%).
Distribution of burned secondary flakes is shown in Table V.16.
Although only 8.6% of the sample is burned, both of the test pits show
a considerably higher percentage of burned flakes. Whether this is a
consequence of preservation or of the presence of a hearth or some
other activity area involving fire, is unknown.
However,
the
I ikel ihood of encountering a hearth in both test pits and none on the
surface seems somewhat slim.
Examination of the level by level
figures for burning indicate that in TP 1 each of the three levels
with more than a few flakes has nearly identical percentages of burned
flakes (of al I types - not just secondary). TP 2, on the other hand,
has a definite peak of burned material 1n level 5, perhaps more
suggestive of an activity area.
Tertiary Flakes (450 specimens)
Tertiary flakes comprise 39.2% of al I flakes from the site, a
figure close to that recorded at 41HI109. The distribution is shown
in Table 24.5.
Among the smaller units, there is considerable
variabi I ity 1n the percentage of tertiary flakes. Looking again at
only the largest 4 units (units 4 and 7, test pits 1 and 2), there 1s
much less variabi I ity.
The greatest variabi I ity among these four,
however, is between the two closest, CU 7 (35.8% tertiary flakes) and
TP 2 (46.2%).
Overal I the percentage of tertiary flakes in these
units (which contain 81.1% of al I flakes from the site) 1s 41.5%,
slightly higher than the figure for the site as a whole.
Table V.17 shows the distribution by unit of various platform
types for tertiary flakes. This distribution shows a great deal of
variabi I ity. Among the large units alone, single facet platforms
range from 30.4% (CU 4) to 65.5% (TP 2) of the sample while multiple
facet platforms range from 22.6% in TP 2 to 39.1% in CU 4. Separating
the site into north (units 7, 8 and TP 2), west (units 4, 5, 6) and
south (units 1, 2, 3, TP 1), there are fewer single facet platforms in
the western floodplain edge portion. Correspondingly, the number of
multiple facet platforms in this area is highest.
These differences
may
indicate activity areas or different components.
This is
discussed further at the conclusion of this section.

24-24

41HI110
The distribution of ventral platform I ips at 41HI110 is shown in
Table V.18.
The percentages of lipped tertiary flakes are generally
variable, but are reasonably close in three of the four largest units.
Only CU 4 (58.0%) has a noticeably divergent percentage of lipped
specimens among these large units. If I ipping can be interpreted as
indicative of the use of soft hammer percussion (Henry, Haynes and
Bradley 1972), then it appears that the floodplain, represented by CU
4, might have been an area of primarily hard hammer percussion. This
is supported by the higher percentage of primary flakes here, a
possible indicator of initial reduction activities, but not by the
large proportion of tertiary flakes which suggest final reduction
stages might be more common. See the discussion at the end of this
section for another perspective on this.
Material type distribution is shown 1n Table V.19.
No clear
pattern 1s observable in the individual units. However, the western
area seems to have a lower overal I percentage of quartzite tertiary
flakes than either the northern or southern areas. In the western
area, only four tertiary flakes (3.7%) are quartzite compared to 10
specimens (6.6%) in the south and 20 specimens (10.5%) in the north.
Table V.20 shows the distribution of thermal alteration by
collection and excavation unit at 41HI110. Most of the smaller units
have no burned specimens at al I.
The distribution of thermally
altered material in the larger units is interesting. Both of the
large surface units have almost no thermally altered material;
one
burned flake was found in CU 7. Both of the test pits, on the other
hand, have relatively high percentages of burned tertiary flakes.
This para I lels the generally higher percentage of burned secondary
flakes found in both test pits (Table V.16).
Flakes:

Discussion

The intra-areal distribution of flakes at 41HI110 shows marked
differences, suggesting activity areas or components perhaps related
to different occupations. It is hypothesized that the western area of
the site was uti I ized for final stage tool manufacture and maintenance
activities, while the slope portions to the north and south are areas
of initial stage reduction or more generalized, multipurpose use.
Final stage tool manufacture and maintenance activities should
leave a distinctive pattern of debitage: high percentages of tertiary
flakes, high percentages of multiple
facet
platforms,
higher
percentages of I ipping (from soft hammer use) and, possibly, fewer
crushed platforms (from more control led,
soft
hammer
blows).
Supporting data is illustrated in Table 24.6 which shows flake classes
broken down by the three major areas at the site (north = units 7, 8,
TP 2; west= units 4, 5, and 6; south= units 1, 2, 3, TP 1). Note
24-25

41HI110
that the percentage of tertiary flakes in the west (45.6%) is clearly
higher.
Raw chi-square for this table is 14.599 with 4 degrees of
freedom yielding a significance of p=.0056 (Nie et al. 1975).
Next, multiple facet platforms are highest in the western area,
both among the total flake sample (Table 24.7) and broken down by
individual flake classes (Table 24.8).
Chi-square values are not
valid for the individual flake class tables, since the class partially
determines the platform type by definition, and are skewed for Table
24.7 because of the difference in flake class percentages between the
areas, as wel I as by the added comp I ications of ground and crushed
platforms.
Nevertheless, the strong chi-square 21.447 with 8 degrees
of freedom with a significance of p=.0061 (Nie et al. 1975) suggests
that these distributional differences may be real.
The data on crushed platforms, however, does not conform to the
test propositions stated above. Table 24.7 indicates that the western
area has about the same percentage of crushed platforms as 1n the
south, while the lowest total percentage is in the north. Broken down
by individual flake classes (Table 24.8), the west has the highest
percentage of crushed platform secondary flakes but the highest
percentage for tertiary flakes.
The areal distribution of ventral platform I ips shows similarly
negative results.
The total distribution of I ipping for al I flake
classes is shown in Table 24.9.
The western area is intermediate
between the northern and southern areas for this distribution. When
broken down by individual flake categories, this relationship holds
for
secondary flakes, but not for tertiary flakes, where the
percentage of specimens in the western area with ventral platform I ips
is the lowest at the site.
Thus, as the test propositions are phrased, the hypothesis
remains unproven.
On the other hand, re-examination of the test
propositions in I ight of these figures suggests other technological
explanations
that
might
account
for the seemingly anomalous
percentages of I ipping and crushed platforms while sti I I offering
support for the final manufacture - maintenance hypothesis. In actual
fact, most maintenance activities probably involve little or no
percussion flaking but rather fine pressure flaking. Likewise, the
last stages of many tool manufacturing activities involve pressure
rather than percussion flaking. Since pressure flaking is less I ikely
to leave a lipped flake than any type of percussion blow, and since
pressure flaking is also likely to leave as high or higher percentages
of crushed platforms than percussion flaking, the data can be seen to
support an altered set of test propositions based on such assumptions.
Further evidence for this would require re-examination of the size and
morphology of flakes for indications of pressure flaking. This data

was not recorded during the analysis, but a subjective assessment
suggests that there are at least some pressure flakes present in the
sample from the western area and that the overal I size of flakes from
this area is somewhat smaller.
CHIPS (768 specimens)
Distribution of chips at 41HI110 is shown in Table 24.4.
The
overal I ratio of flakes to chips is 1.50:1. Although there is some
variability in this ratio among the individual units (from 3.63:1 tn
the smal I CU 1 to 1.06:1 for TP 1), the three primary site areas have
approximately equal ratios (south= 1.42:1; west= 1.55:1;
north =
1.54:1).
As might be expected, burning is more common overal I on chips
(13.7%) than on flakes (8.0%). Table V.21 shows the distribution of
thermally altered chips at the site.
This distribution generally
para I lels that of the flakes with high percentages in both test pits.
The same table shows the distribution of material types for chips
recovered from 41HI110. The overal I percentage of quartzite (6.3%) is
relatively low compared to that for flakes as a whole, but somewhat
similar to the percentage for tertiary flakes as a group. This may be
an indication that chips are more I ikely to be produced in the final
stages of the reduction process, or that quartzite shear strength is
greater than that of chert and that quartzite flakes are less I ikely
to fragment under stress. The lowest percentage of quartzite chips is
found in the western area of the site (west= 4.6% quartzite; south =
6.5% quartzite; north = 6.9% quartzite). These percentages would be
even more divergent if considering total non-chert materials since
both the northern and southern areas, but not the west, yielded quartz
chips.
CORES (25 specimens)
Twenty-five cores were collected from 41HI110 during the two
seasons of investigations by TAS. These comprise 1.2% of al I I ithic
debris from the site (or 1.3% of al I I ithic debitage). Fourteen were
collected from the southern portion (SMU x41HI85) 1 four from the
western (floodplain) and seven from the northern area.
Five of the
specimens from the southern area are from CU 2 while the remainder are
from the general surface in that area. Three of the western specimens
are from CU 4 while the fourth is from CU 5. Two of the northern
specimens are from TP 2, two are from CU 7 and the remaining three are
from the general surface collection in that area. Seven cores were
collected in 1980, al I but one of these from the southern area. While

collection total) may represent an accident of sampling error or
possible collection bias, the 1982 figure of 2.9% cores from the
southern area, while much lower, is sti I I larger than for the other
areas.
Altogether, cores from the southern area form 4.2% of al I
I ithic debris, while cores from the western and northern areas
comprise 1.0 and 1.2% respectively.
Only three of these cores are of quartzite, two of coarse grained
material and another of fine grained Ogal I ala quartzite. Two of the
cores fragments show signs of thermal alteration.
A statistical
summary of the dimensions of the core types is shown in Table V.21.
Unidirectional Cores (5 specimens)
Although these specimens were recovered from every major area of
the site, they occur in clusters. Two specimens are from TP 2 in the
northern portion, two are CU 4 in the western portion and the fifth is
from the general surface of the southern area. These cores include
four specimens which are essentially tested cobbles. The two smallest
have only one flake removal each. A smal I split pebble has a couple
of smal I removals from interior facet platforms on the split face;
this specimen may be an initial stage tool blank rather than a core.
Two of the three quartzite specimens are among this group.
Both are
considerably larger than the other three unidirectional specimens. A
fine grain specimen has one large flake removal scar in addition to
several smaller scars that seem to be recent edge damage, and another
coarse grain specimen has at least three removals, the most of any 1n
this group.
Bidirectional Cores (2 specimens)
One of these cores is from the general surface collection in the
northern area and the other is from CU 4 in the western area. Both
have several flake scar removals originating from a single previous
large flake scar. One specimen is smal I and the flakes removed from
it too tiny to be useful; this may be an abandoned tool blank.
The
other specimen is larger, with larger removals, but could just as
easily have been intended as a blank. Both specimens are chert.
Bifacial Cores (2 specimens)
One of these specimens is from CU 2 in the northern area and the
other is from CU 5 in the western area. This group includes one chert
and one coarse grain quartzite specimen.
The chert specimen is
bifacial ly worked around nearly 180 degrees of edges and comes close
to being considered a biface. It is crudely chipped however, and has
several fracture planes which lessen its uti I ity. The quartzite
24-30

41HI110
specimen has one face that is almost devoid of cortex with several
removals from the opposing face at either end. It has one slightly
battered edge and may have functioned as a smal I chopper tool.
It
also may have been intended as a blank for one of the small quartzite
net sinkers (Waco Sinkers) found at several sites in the Aqui I la Lake
area.
Multidirectional Cores (3 specimens)
Three multidirectional chert cores were recovered from the site,
two in the 1980 season and the third in 1982. The former two are from
the general surface at the southern end and the latter is from CU 7 in
the northern area.
These specimens, al I made from relatively smal I
stream cobbles, are the best defined cores from the site.
One
pinkish-gray specimen (heat treated?) has a series of overlapping
lateral removals, al I from cortex platforms.
Another specimen has
larger
flake scars removed from both cortex and single facet
platforms. The final specimen has an ovate shape and a triangular
cross section with removals perpendicular to two of the faces and a
single large removal scar running the length of the rema1n1ng face.
Al I observed platforms on this specimen are single facet.
Core Fragments (13 specimens)
These thirteen smal I specimens form the largest group of cores
from the site, more than half of al I specimens. These specimens
include 10 from the southern area (4 from CU 2 and 6 from the general
surface in that area) and 3 from the north (1 from CU 7 and 2 from the
general surface). Very I ittle can be said of these specimens.
They
are either fragments of larger cores or the exhausted remnants of
them. Al I are essentially multidirectional and al I have interior
single facet platforms, while a few sti I I retain cortex platforms.
Al I are chert. Two specimens are thermally altered.
None 1s large
enough to be useful for further removals.
Cores:

Discussion

The distribution of cores shows a strong bias toward the southern
end with 14 specimens, or 56.0%, of al I cores from that area,
contrasted to only 18.6% of al I lithic debris from the surface in that
area and 37.7% of lithic debris from al I units. This high percentage
is somewhat misleading however, since 10 of these 14 specimens are
tiny core fragments or exhausted cores. Nonetheless, it seems I ikely
that the southern end of the site was an area more frequently uti I ized
for initial stage tool manufacture, an hypothesis partially supported
by the flake data. The paucity of cores from the other areas does not
support such a hypothesis elsewhere. This paucity is particularly
emphasized by the fact that two of the four specimens from the western
24-31

41HI110
area are unidirectional (actually nothing more than tested cobbles) as
are two of the five specimens from the northern area. Note that while
the western area has been described above as an area of final tool
manufacture and maintenance, these data are somewhat contradictory for
the
northern
area
which has previously been suggested as a
manufacturing area.
Modified Debitage/Informal Tools
As at 41HI109, a large number of specimens of modified debitage
were originally separated out on the basis of edge damage. Subsequent
examination showed that many had random, unpatterned edge damage and
that others had types of edge damage singled out by Mal louf (1981) in
his study of flake damage related to agricultural activities. Caution
is
emphasized here in the interpretation of modified debitage
recovered from on and near the surface of sites that may have been
cleared
or
plowed
in
the
past.
Because of this problem,
identification of modified debitage has been conservative, and only
obvious specimens included here.
For this reason, the sample of
twelve specimens probably somewhat under represents
the
total
percentage of uti Ii zed debitage and should not be taken as an
indication that activities represented by modified debitage were not
carried out. Hopefully, however, it represents a sample of the kinds
of activities that did occur at the site.
TYPE 1 ATTRITION (8 specimens, 11 facets)
Type 1 attrition, with smal I wide flake scars with I ittle or no
definition of negative bulb, was the most common type of modification
at the site. Two facets on two specimens were unifacial ly modified,
six facets on five specimens were bifacial ly modified and three facets
on three different specimens exhibited a combination of unifacial and
bifacial modification of one edge. No straight edge outlines were
recorded among this group; outlines were about equally divided among
concave, convex and concave-convex. Three facets were concave, four
convex and four concave-convex. None of the multiple facet specimens
repeated the same edge outline on both facets (no specimens had more
than two facets).
Lateral edges were preferred for location of
uti I ization.
Eight facets on six specimens were lateral edges. One
specimen was uti I ized on an edge obi ique to the platform, one on the
combined lateral and distal edges and one specimen was indeterminate.
Seven specimens were uti Ii zed on ventral and dorsal surfaces, three on
the dorsal and only one on the ventral surface. Eight specimens had
both feather and step microf lake terminations, while two had only step
and one had only feather terminations. Eight specimens had light
abrasion, three exhibited polish and one specimen showed no sign of
any abrasion.
Blank preference was primarily chips, with four chips
uti I ized in addition to two secondary and two tertiary flakes.
Five
24-32

41HI110
specimens were from the southern area of the site, one from CU 12 and
the remainder from the general surface. Only two specimens with Type
1 attrition were from the northern area, with one from CU 7 and the
other from the general surface. Only one specimen, from CU 6, was
recovered from the western portion of the site.
TYPE 2 ATTRITION (2 specimens, 2 facets)
Only two specimens from the site exhibited Type 2 attrition. One
of
these,
a
secondary flake, was unifacial ly modified on a
concave-convex section of the dorsal surface of one lateral edge.
This specimen exhibited feather microf lake terminations and some
polish. It was recovered from the general surface collection at the
northern end of the site in 1980. The second specimen, a chip, has
bifacial modification on both faces of the apparent platform end of
the flake, obliterating the platform itself. It has both feather and
step microflake terminations and exhibits some signs of polish.
This
specimen was recovered from CU 2 at the southern end of the site in
1982.
TYPES 1 AND 2 ATTRITION (2 specimens, 2 facets)
The first of these two specimens, a secondary flake, has
unifacial modification of a concave-convex segment of the dorsal
surface of a lateral edge. Both types of microf lake terminations are
present with I ight polish. This specimen was recovered from the north
general surface in 1980. The second specimen, a chip (which has
another facet with Type 1 attrition described above), has unifacial
modification of a convex segment of the dorsal surface of an
indeterminate edge. It has both types of microflake terminations with
I ight abrasion. It was recovered from the south general surface 1n
1980.
ABRASION (1 specimen, 1 facet)
Only one specimen, a chip recovered from the south general
surface in 1982 (with a second facet of Type 1 attrition described
above), exhibits I ight abrasion. The modification is both unifacial
and bifacial on both surfaces of a concave edge.
BATTERING (1 specimen, 2 facets)
One secondary flake has battering present on two facets.
Both
facets have bifacial modification on an indeterminate straight edge.
Both also have step microflake terminations and light abrasion.
This
specimen was collected from the south general surface in 1980.

41HI110
MODIFIED DEBITAGE:

DISCUSSION

The percentage of modified debitage should not be taken as an
indication of the total utilization of informal tools at the site.
Since the sample size is so smal I, the types recorded here are also
probably not representative of the actual percentages of modification
which occurred. Overal I, seven specimens were recovered from the
south end of the site, four from the north and only one from the
floodplain area. It is interesting that the fewest specimens were
recovered from the floodplain area since, according to the hypothesis
offered above, a final manufacture and maintenance area is probably
the most I ikely to exhibit normal campsite activities and therefore
should show the highest percentage of uti I ized debitage.
Overal I, selection of blanks shows flakes slightly more popular
than chips (7 to 5), but chips equal secondary flakes by themselves (5
specimens) and outnumber tertiary flakes
(2
specimens).
The
relatively infrequent use of the generally smaller tertiary flakes is
probably to be expected.
Dual facet specimens are about equally
divided, with two on secondary flakes, two on chips and one on
tertiary flakes.
Formal Tools
UNIFACES (6 specimens)
Unifacial tools are slightly more common at 41HI110 than they are
at many sites in the Aqui I la Lake area, although they comprise only
about 0.3% of the total sample of I ithic debris.
Al I of these
specimens were collected in 1982. One specimen is from TP 2, while
the remainder are from the control led surface collection.
Two are
from the south general surface with one each from collection units 4,
6 and 8. The specimens are evenly distributed among the site areas
with two each from the north, south and west of the site.
The largest of these is an end scraper on a large, heavy,
subtriangular flake with a triangular cross section (Fig. 24.5a). The
steep angled uti Ii zed edge occupies a 180 degree section at the distal
end of the flake. Use-wear on the modified edge is classified as Type
2 attrition.
The relatively I ight abrasion and extensive step
fracturing on the bit end suggest use on some hard material such as
hardwood or bone. One lateral edge may also have been uti I ized
unifacial ly as wel I.
This specimen was recovered from CU 6 in the
western area of the site.
The most extensively modified of all the unifaces from the site
1s a triangular end scraper which 1s unifacial ly modified along the
length of al I three edges, with a smal I amount
of
bifacial
24-34

41Hl110
modification near the proximal end on one face in an attempt to thin
the very thick bulb of percussion. This specimen (Fig. 24.Sb) also
exhibits Type 2 attrition, with extensive polish along one section of
the acute angled distal end, suggesting use on a soft to soft medium
material, perhaps a high silica content plant fiber.
Another of the unifacial specimens is a steep angled end scraper
made on a smal I, round split cobble (Fig. 24.5c). This modified
secondary flake has extensive Type 2 attrition along most of the
length of the modified edge, which occupies a I ittle less than 180
degrees of flake edge. It has light polish and was probably uti I ized
with some medium hard material. Yet another specimen is an end and
side scraper with modification primarily on the distal end but use on
both the distal and one lateral edge (Fig. 24.5d).
Distal end
uti I ization is Type 2, occurring uni facially on the dorsal surface
with medium abrasion of the acute angled edge. The lateral edge
demonstrates bifacial Type 2 attrition with I ight abrasion.
The
distal end was probably use in scraping a soft medium material and the
lateral end in cutting the same or a slightly harder material.
One of the remaining specimens is an acute angled end scraper
(Fig. 24.Se) made on a very short, wide flake so that the distal end
is by far the longest edge of the flake, making it more resemble a
side scraper.
Intentional modification is unifacial around most of
the circumference of the piece. Use-wear includes both types 1 and 2
attrition. A slight polish was observed on the edges. Cutting action
and material are unknown.
The final specimen (Fig. 24.5f) is a
fragment of a unifacial ly modified and uti I ized edge. It exhibits
unifacial Type 2 attrition on a somewhat steep angled edge, but little
can be said about the locus of uti I ization or the type of materials
worked.
BIFACES (51 specimens)
Thick Bifaces (26 specimens)
Eight of these 26 specimens were from the 1980 collection, and
eleven of the remainder were from the 1982 surface collection. Only
six thick bifaces are from excavation units, two from TP 1 and four
from TP 2.
Thick Bifacial Tools (7 specimens)
Four of these specimens are fine grain quartzite chopper tools.
Two of these are almost unifacial, with only what may amount to heavy
use wear or minimal retouch on one face. These two are included here
because they appear to be good examples of this basic type of heavy
quartzite, chopper-I ike artifact, a type that is primarily bifacial.

One
of these two semi-unifacial specimens shows only moderate
battering wear on two different edges while the other three have
extensive battering wear on one or more working edges. Only one of
these four specimens does not appear to have at least two distinct
working edges.

evidence of use outside of the chopper tools. One of these, with

further.
No polish is visible and the edge is somewhat rough,
suggesting uti I ization with medium to hard medium materials such as
hide or soft wood.

material type; while other purple quartzite flakes have been found at
these hi I !side sites (41HI109, 41HI110 and 41HI111), no purple
quartzite tools of any kind have been recovered. Asimilar purple
quartzite "net sinker" was recovered from the surface of 41HI117 1n
1980.
Only six of the rema1n1ng 19 thick bifaces are complete. Neither
the whole specimens nor the fragments show any sign of use and are
considered rejected attempts at bifacial reduction. Thirteen of the
19 are classed here as roughouts and six as blanks. None can be
assigned to one of the 1980 form groups.
Roughouts (13 specimens)
Five complete and eight fragmentary bifacial roughouts share
sinuous, poorly formed edges with large percussion flake scars and a
general formlessness. Al I but two of the smaller specimens have some
amount of cortex present. Four specimens have cortex on both faces.
One smal I petrified wood roughout is the only non-chert specimen 1n
this category. None of the roughouts are clearly burned.
None of the broken specimens are large enough for further
reduction and three of the complete specimens are too smal I and too
thick to be efficiently reduced further. Most of these do not even
have any edges regular enough to be useful as a tool. The largest
24-37

41Hlll0
complete specimen, long and narrow with a bipointed semi-lanceolate
form, has a triangular cross-section that would be difficult to reduce
further. The last complete specimen might be reducible but has uneven
material qua I ity and some grainy inclusions.
Blanks (6 specimens)
One complete and five fragmentary blanks al I have thick but
regular cross sections, with less sinuous edges than the roughouts.

chert and none show any evidence of thermal alteration.
The
fragmentary specimens were abandoned because they are broken, most
apparently in manufacture, since there is no evidence of use. The one
complete specimen has a large bulge at one end of the base and a
strong twist to the blade but may have been salvageable as some sort
of bifacial tool (Fig. 24.5i).
Thin Bifaces (25 specimens)
A total of 25 thin bifaces were collected from the site, only
three of which are complete. The remaining specimens include five
basal fragments, four distal fragments, two unidentified end fragments

None are complete and none have clear diagnostic value, although a
thin, square basal fragment from level 3 of TP 1 may be an arrow point
preform fragment.

from surface collection units.
Nonetheless, al I of the use-wear

three other specimens with very dubious evidence of attrition on the

classified within any of the formal types described during the 1980
analysis, with the exception of a single apparent Form 12 specimen
described below.
FORM 12. This tiny specimen ts apparently the broken base of a
flake dri I I (Fig. 24.6a). The tip of the broken shaft shows extensive
smoothing, indicating use after breakage. The edges of the flake base
exhibit

relatively unique specimen among the Aqui I la Lake dri I Is, which are
made on unmodified flakes or re-uti I ized dart points, but never on

in the count here, is made on the basal end of an expanding stem
projectile point. It has extensive smoothing wear at the end of the
bit.
It is described further under Miscellaneous Expanding stem
projectile points.
Four of the remaining specimens have various degrees of edge
dul I ing related to use.
Two of these are distal fragments and the
other two undetermined end fragments. Al I were used bi facially with
some soft medium to medium hard material. A fifth specimen has some
slight edge dul I ing associated with very smal I but regular unifacial
attrition scars, suggesting use as a scraper with some soft medium
material.
Preform

1.

(4 specimens)

Like other specimens included 1n this category, these thin
bifaces have less regular edges and cruder outlines than specimens
classified as Preform II. Three of the four are broken, and have
cortex present.
One of these has extensive inclusions which reduce
the overal I qua I ity of the material.
The complete specimen has a
large medial lump which prevents further reduction (Fig. 24.6b).
Preform..!! (15 specimens)
Two of these are complete.
One 1s a narrow subtriangular
specimen that may have been an arrow point preform (Fig. 24.6c). It
may even have served as an arrow point; it is similar to triangular
specimens classed as arrow points at the McDonald Site - 41HI105.
There is no evidence for this, and its cross section is slightly
thicker than most finished specimens, suggesting that it was made too
narrow and too wide, particularly at the base, to effectively notch.
The other complete specimen is a smal I, ovoid lunate piece with a
piano-convex cross section (Fig. 24.6d). Its form suggests a smal I
scraping tool, but the edges are somewhat sinuous and show no evidence
of uti I ization. It is thick for its size and may be an abandoned
arrow point preform.
At least two basal fragments from this group are small and thin
enough to suggest that they were possibly arrow point preforms. One
of these contracts moderately above the slightly rounded base, while
the other is wider and squarer. Three and perhaps even four of the
better made of these specimens have thick lenticular (almost diamond
shaped) cross sections and may have been from dart points or dart
point preforms. Another large distal specimen is within the range of
size, thickness and workmanship of Cleburne knives, although it too
may have been a dart point or dart point preform fragment.
24-39

41HI110

PROJECTILE POINTS
Fifteen projectile points were recovered from the 1980 and 1982
investigations at the site. This includes 2 arrow points and 13 dart
points. In addition to these specimens, an additional arrow and 9
dart points recovered by SMU in 1972 and 1975 are described, bringing
the total number of projectile points from 41HI110 to 25 specimens.
Arrow Points (3 specimens)
Bonham-I ike (1 specimen)
This single specimen (Fig. 24.6e) has a long triangular blade
with serrated edges and long barbs (one is broken). The para I lel
sided stem is long narrow and squared off at the base.
It was
recovered from CU 9A during the 1982 season. This specimen shows some
similarities to various long stem arrow points recovered from the
McDonald Site.
Despite the square base of these latter specimens,
their workmanship and pronounced

place them
sty I istical ly closer to Perdiz points from that site rather than Alba
or Seal lorn.
Unidentified (2 specimens)
One or both of these expanding stem points may be a variant of
the Seal lorn type, although this is not certain. The more complete of
the two is a tiny specimen of white chert with a short, stubby
triangular blade, prominent straight shoulders and a bulbous stem
(Fig. 24.6f). One shoulder is broken. This specimen was recovered
from level 3 of TP 2; the only diagnostic projectile point recovered
from a subsurface context at any of the hi I Iside sites south of
McDonald - 41HI109, 41HI110, 41Hllll.
The other unidentified specimen was recovered by SMU from the
surface of the site formerly designated as x41HI84, close to the
location of TP 2 at 41HI110.
This fragmentary burned specimen 1s
corner notched, having a strongly expanding stem with a rounded base
(Fig. 24.Sg). Although a portion of the stem has been broken off, it
appears to be more rounded at the base than is usual for Seal lorn
points, although otherwise it appears to fit the criteria for this
type.

Angostura (1 specimen)
One of two Angostura points collected from the Aqui I la Lake area,
this specimen was recovered by SMU during the 1972 survey from the
site known as x41Hl85, the badly eroded southern portion of 41HI110.
This lanceolate basal fragment contracts slightly from the midsection
down to its concave base (Fig. 24.Sh). The lower portion of the stem
and the base are heavily smoothed.

1980,

(Suhm and Jelks 1962:169-170). Although the base is wedge shaped, it
1s less wel I made than on many Bulverde specimens, an apparent remnant
of interior platform facet remains on one end.
Dari-I ike (1 specimen)
This specimen, collected from the surface of x41HI85 by SMU, has
some of the characteristic traits of the Dari type, including a long
narrow blade, righthand beveling, serrated "b'i"ide and an approximately
para I lel sided stem (Fig. 24.Sj). The shoulders are prominent, almost
barbed, and the stem expands slightly, having a slightly rounded base
in the manner of some Godley points observed in the Aqui I la Lake
collection. Although it cannot unquestionably be included within the
Dari category, it is felt to date to either the Late or Transitional
Archaic Period.
El I is (1 specimen)
One specimen, collected from the surface of old SMU x41HI85 in
1972, is classed here as an Ell is point (Suhm and Jelks 1962:187-188).

these two, from 1982, has a smal I, narrow triangular (resharpened?)
blade with moderately prominent outward projecting, pointed shoulders
and a moderately contracting, unmodified platform base (Fig. 24.61).
It is manufactured from a banded reddish-brown chert not commonly seen
in the area and retains a smal I patch of cortex on the stem beneath
the unmodified platform base. The other specimen, slightly longer, is
similar to the one described above. It has a narrow triangular blade,
slight shoulders, a moderately contracting stem and an unmodified stem
base (Fig. 24.6m).
Godley (2 specimens)
One of these two specimens was recovered from the surface of
x41HI83 during the 1972 survey, while the other was collected from the
surface of the north end of 41HI110 during the 1982 investigations.
The latter of these two, missing the distal end and a portion of one
lateral edge, is the best example of a
smal I
Godley
point
(Fig. 24.6n). It has a narrow triangular blade with rounded shoulders
and a moderately expanding stem with a slightly rounded convex base.
Stem edges and base are ground. Although smal I, it is morphologically
similar to other Godley points from the Aqui I la Lake area. The other
specimen, larger and more crudely made, has a triangular blade broken
halfway up, with prominent shoulders (one almost barbed), a moderately
expanding stem and a slightly rounded convex stem base (Fig. 24.7a).
It is manufactured from a crude chert with several inclusions and may
never have been finished.
It is similar to a number of projectile
points found at Aqui I la Lake which are classed as Godley, but are
somewhat larger and with more prominent barbs than is usually
associated with this type.
Pedernales (2 specimens)
One fragmentary specimen, collected from the north end of the
site during 1982, is missing its distal end, al I of one lateral edge
and the tip of the opposite shoulder (Fig. 24.7b). The stem contracts
very slightly with a concave base. Stem edges and base are lightly
ground. Another specimen, from the SMU surface collection at x41HI83,
is also missing a large portion of the distal end (Fig. 24.7c).
Shoulders are moderately prominent, but not barbed.
The stem is
para I lel sided, or very slightly contracting, with a slightly concave
base. Although not a classic Central Texas Pedernales type, it does
bears some resemblance to the other specimen from this site and to
other Pedernales specimens from the Aqui I la Lake ar.ea.

Miscellaneous Expanding stemmed (2 specimens)
The first of these specimens, collected from the surface of the
site in 1980, has a long, narrow triangular blade with slightly convex
blade edges and moderately prominent shoulders, and
moderately
expanding stem with straight base (Fig. 24.7d). The other specimen,
from the 1982 surface collection at the southern end of the site, has
been made into a dri I I and exhibits extensive wear at the end of the
bit (Fig. 24.7e). It has prominent shoulders, moderately expanding
stem and a concave base. Stem edges and base are ground. Although it
is impossible to accurately classify this reworked specimen, the base
bears some resemblance to the Dari (Suhm and Jelks 1962) although the
shoulders seem a bit more prominent than is common in that type. This
specimen is also discussed in the section on bifacial dri I Is.
Miscellaneous Para I lel stemmed (1 specimen)
This smal I projectile point was collected from the north end of
the site in 1982. It has a narrow, asymmetrical blade and is missing
the distal end (Fig. 24.7f). One shoulder is moderately prominent;
the other is barely noticeable.
The stem is long and narrow with

slightly ground. Although this specimen may be a rejected preform, as
suggested by its asymmetry, the stem grinding may indicate that it was
uti I ized.
It cannot be typed but it is similar to several other
better made specimens from the Aqui Ila Lake area with long narrow
para I lei sided stems.
Miscellaneous Square stemmed (4 specimens)
These four specimens are characterized by a smal I, short squarish
stem below a smal I to moderate triangular blade. Two specimens, one
from x41HI85 and the other from x41HI83, have nearly identical small,
square stems with slightly concave bases and prominent barbs. One,
and to some degree the other as wel I, bears some resemblance to the
Marshal I (Suhm and Jelks 1962:211-212), but is smaller than the
general range for this type (Fig. 24.7g). This specimen is made from
a black chert that is not common in the area but does occur
infrequently among the Uvalde gravels.
Another specimen, somewhat
more crudely made and with less prominent barbs, is made of a grainy
banded chert (Fig. 24.7h). Several other projectile points from the
project area are almost identical to these. Another point has an
asymmetrical blade above a square stem with a
straight base
(Fig. 24.7i).
Its triangular blade is somewhat wider than the other
two specimens and its smal I barbs less prominent.
The rema1n1ng
specimen is different from the others. Collected during 1980, it has
a smal I triangular blade with slightly convex edges, moderately

edges and a straight base (Fig. 24.7j).
Miscellaneous Dart Point fragments (5 specimens)
Al I of these
specimens
are
too
fragmentary
for
type
identification.
These include four stemmed bases or fragments
thereof, and one medial section with a portion of slightly barbed
shoulder at one corner. Four are from the 1982 investigations at the
north end of the site and the remaining specimen was collected by SMU
from x41HI85, the intensely gul I ied area at the southern end. One of
the former has edges which contract very slightly toward the concave
base.
Both base and edges are ground. Although the specimen is
somewhat thick and not extremely wel I made, it might be the base of an
Angostura point (Fig. 24.7k). Another, the SMU specimen from x41HI85,
is a basal fragment with one corner of the stem broken (Fig. 24.71).
The stem apparently would have been squarish, perhaps expanding
slightly, with a straight base. One shoulder is almost barbed, the
tip of the other is broken.
It shows some similarities to the
Miscellaneous Square stemmed specimens described above but its stem is
slightly larger and thicker.
Another of these fragments is no more than a short section of a
slightly expanding, square based stem, ground on the base. It is
impossible to type. The final specimen is missing the distal portion
and
the base of the stem.
What remains indicates prominent,
asymmetrical shoulders with an approximately para I lel sided stem.
This specimen may have been broken during manufacture.
Projectile Points:

Discussion

The obvious conclusion to be drawn from the wide variety of
projectile points is that the site was occupied often over a long span
of time. Evidence of occupation spans the period from the Early
Archaic (Angostura), through Middle Archaic Pedernales), Late Archaic
~, and perhaps, El I is), Transitional
Arc aic
odle) into the
Late Prehistoric (al I of the arrow points). The majority of these
specimens are not diagnostic, however, so it is difficult to elicit
any pattern of occupation through time. Also, as with materials from
many surf icial sites, there is an enormous range of variation in the
projectile points present, with almost no two alike, including the two
Godley specimens, which are dissimilar. The only two pairs which show
any great technological similarities are two of the Miscellaneous
Square based specimens, which may be contemporaneous, and the two Gary
points.

Specimens dating to the

Transitional
Archaic
and
Late
Prehistoric were recovered from both ends. In fact, both cases of
similar pairs of points were recovered from opposite ends of the site.
Flaked Stone:

Discussion

On the whole there are a number of indications from the flaked
stone assemblage that this site was often utilized as a lithic
workshop area, chipping cobbles found on the hi I I sides or bringing in
specimens from the Uvalde gravel procurement site (41HI162) on top of
the hi I I. The high number of primary and secondary flakes and the
relative frequency of cores and thick bifaces from some of the surface
collection units supports this interpretation. Additionally, only a
few of the bifaces show clear evidence of use, most apparently being
manufacture rejects. A number of projectile points are either broken
or somewhat crudely made. On the other hand, the tools indicate that
the site was uti I ized for other activities as wel I as lithic
manufacture.
GROUND STONE
Hammerstones (19 specimens)
Al I of the ground stone specimens collected during 1980 and 1982
are hammerstones or hammerstone-1 ike objects.
One of these was
recovered from the 1980 surface collection at the south end of the
site. One of the 1982 specimens is from the excavation of TP 2, while
the remainder of the 1982 specimens came from the surface collection
units, 5 from the north end and 12 from the south end of the site.
Fifteen of these are whole, ranging in size from large cobbles
(approaching 10 cm in length) to smal I pebbles (the smallest is under
4 cm in length) that may be of dubious value as hammerstones. Al I of
the broken specimens have battering wear on the one remaining edge,
while three complete specimens have wear on one edge only.
Four
specimens have wear at either end, two have wear on one end and along
one lateral edge, one has wear only along one lateral edge and the
rema1n1ng three specimens have extensive wear around more than 180
degrees of edge.

41HI110
SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
As indicated 1n the discussion of projectile points,
the
multicomponent nature of this site is obvious, with occupations
occurring at intervals from the Early Archaic to the Late Prehistoric.
Although a number of the potentially identifiable projectile points
cannot be associated with temporally diagnostic types, there seems to
be a relatively even distribution through time, with perhaps a
slightly greater emphasis on the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
periods.
This emphasis is clear if the unidentified Square Stemmed
points can be related to the Late or Transitional Archaic.
Many of the site occupations were concerned with early stages of
I ithic manufacture, as recorded in the high percentages of primary and
secondary flakes and the frequency of thick bifaces and cores.
Although almost none of the sites investigated in the Aqui I la Lake
area have no lithic manufacture component, with the possible exception
of the McKenzie Site, many, including the floodplain habitation sites
such as Reps Davis and McDonald, tend to exhibit a greater emphasis on
final stage manufacture and maintenance of tools. On the other hand,
sites near material sources wi II generally include a large component
of primary I ithic material in addition to whatever other activities
occurred there.
At 41HI110 there is a suggestion that the western area, at the
upland edge of the Hackberry Creek floodplain, was less uti Ii zed for
primary I ithic manufacture than for final stage manufacture and
maintenance.
If this means anything in terms of 6000 years of
intermittent occupations, it is probably indicative of the presence of
raw material on the hi I lside and the lack of it in the floodplain.
Although it is somewhat hard to imagine the distance of a score or few
scores of meters making much difference in campsite location or
activity choice, it seems, judging from the statistics provided above,
that this was the case when looking at superimposed debris from
thousands of years of ephemeral campsites.
Occupation of a large portion of the campsite may have been less
ephemeral if the smal I drainage on the south previously held more
water or if Hackberry Creek flowed closer to the site. The main creek
channel may have meandered close to 41HI110 at some point in time.
The temporal spread of diagnostic artifacts does not argue for a more
intense occupation at any one time, however.
Although a large amount of cultural material was collected from
the surface of this site, and more subsurface material was recovered
here than at either 41HI109 or 41HI111, there has been I ittle evidence
to suggest that any of this material was in situ. There is even less
evidence for the association of any o-:r- this material with any
24-48

41HI110
unspecified single component at the site, much less a datable
component. Because of this, the analysis of material cannot be taken
to represent any particular time period and is difficult to compare to
other sites in the area.

SITE DESCRIPTION
Site 41HI111 is approximately 2.1 kilometers northeast of the
confluence of Hackberry and Aqui I la creeks and immediately south of
41HI110, separated by a small intermittent drainage. It extends from
the slopes of the alluvial valley onto the modern floodplain of the
creek (Fig. 25.1). The eastern site boundary is about halfway up the
slope near the 168 meter (551 ft.) MSL contour, although the greatest
concentration of material I ies below this. The western boundary is a
shallow linear depression, probably an old creek channel, about 75
meters from the modern channel of the creek (Fig. 25.2).
Uni ike the
two hi I I side sites to the north (41HI109 and 41HI110) that contained
several high density patches of surface artifacts exposed by erosion,
this site is marked by only a few areas of very I ight density artifact
scatters and relatively large areas of no visible surface cultural
materials.
Also unlike the two sites to the north, 41HI111 has an
area of moderate density surface artifactual materials on
the
floodplain.
These materials are clearly not redeposited from higher
up the slopes. Unfortunately, this area was not discovered unti I
after the field season ended, when construction activities related to
the Hillsboro Water Supply Intake Tower uncovered buried mussel shel I
and burned rock.
As at both 41HI109 and 41HI110, the hi I I slope portion of 41HI111
1s formed from Upper Cretaceous Woodbine Formation sediments, capped
by deposits of the Cretaceous Eagle Ford Group Lake Waco and South
Bosque formations (Barnes 1970). As noted at the other sites, al I of
the cultural material appears to lie on the Woodbine portion of the
slope. Extending creekward from the lower slopes of the Woodbine is a
large alluvial fan composed of materials eroded from the hi I I side.
The reddish-brown clay and clay loam soils of this fan over I ie and
perhaps merge into a smal I remnant of an older alluvial terrace of
Hackberry Creek.
The general geomorphological structure of the
hillside is very much like that at 41HI110, except that the alluvial

fan at 41Hllll is larger and flatter, effectively hiding the point at
which it merges with the terrace.
As at 41HI110, soi Is on the slope portion of the site are mapped
by the SCS as Normangee Clay Loam, 3 to 5% slopes.
A brief
description of this soi I is included in the chapter on 41HI110.
The
most important difference between the two sites is the somewhat
flatter terrain and the lack of extreme gully erosion here.
Shovel
testing on the alluvial fan and terrace surfaces showed a rather
complex distribution of red, brown and tan clays and clay loams, but
al I with characteristics that fit the general definition of Normangee
series soi Is.
As with 41Hll09 and 41HI110, this site extends down onto, and
apparently
into,
recent alluvial deposits of Hackberry Creek.
Although the density of cultural materials in this area 1s slightly
greater than at the other two sites, the actual area of floodplain
containing these materials is slightly smaller. Soi Is formed in these
recent alluvial sediments are classified as Tinn Clay, frequently
flooded, and are described in more detai I in the chapters on 41Hl109
and 41Hlll0.
For a detailed profile and more discussion, see the
section on stratigraphy in the chapter on the McDonald Site (41HI105).
Like 41Hll09 and 41HI110, this site I ies within the lowland
forest association of the Blackland Prairie. The floodplain portion
has been cleared and plowed in the past but was abandoned and heavily
overgrown at the time of the archeological investigations. The
terrace, fan and slope portions were covered with a moderately dense
broadleaf oak forest at that time.
Although not as extensive as at 41HI110, disturbances here have
been serious. The floodplain had been plowed for many years prior to
the investigations. Several smal I erosional gul I ies had formed on the
slopes and two dirt roads crossing the site from north to south were
rutted and gul I ied. That portion of the site lying beneath the
conservation pool level (essentially al I of the fan and terrace
deposits) has been bul I dozed to remove trees from the lake shore I ine.
Construction of the Hi I lsboro Water Supply Intake Tower and excavation
of a large ditch running creekward from the tower have disturbed areas
of the site. Despite this, portions I ie above the clearing I imit and
possibly extend downward below the plow zone in the floodplain where a
large deposit of cultural materials may remain undisturbed.

41HI111
SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK
This site was originally recorded as x41HI86 during the SMU
survey in 1972 (Skinner and Henderson 1972). At that time, the only
portion of the site recognized was a smal I area of upland slope lying
at about 165 meters (541 ft.) MSL elevation. Lynott and Peter (1977)
returned here in 1975 to map and test the area. Five posthole tests
found sandy soi Is on the slope to be no deeper than 10 centimeters. A
surface collection was subsequently undertaken. The conclusions were
that the site was severely disturbed, although perhaps not previously
collected by relic hunters (Lynott and Peter 1977:90-93).
Lynott and Peter's interpretation is as a foraging station, based
on the low number and limited variety of artifacts, as wel I as the
smal I size; tentatively dating the site as being intermittently
uti I ized from the Early to Transitional Archaic periods. This date is
based on three diagnostic projectile points that they identify as
Dari, Pedernales and either Edgewood or Martindale (Lynott and Peter
1977).
DATA COLLECTION
As pointed out in the previous two chapters, it was decided that
the series of hi I Iside sites would need further investigation to
determine their archeological significance and National Register
el igibi I ity.
The only work carried out by the 1980 TAS crew was
surface collection of artifacts. No subsurface testing was conducted
here in 1980 due to the shallow nature of the hi I I slope soi Is. At
this time, however, it was recognized that the site was somewhat
larger than originally recorded by SMU.
During the original visits to the hi I I side sites (41HI109,
41HI110 and 41HI111) during the 1982 field season, the opinion was
expressed by Robert Burton, the Corps of Engineers archeologist, and
several crew members who had worked on the site in 1980, that I ittle
possibi I ity existed for subsurface deposits south of the creek that
separates 41HI110 from 41HI111. Unfortunately, at this time, due to a
mix up in the notes, the southern half of 41HI110 was incorrectly
designated as 41HI111.
This error was later corrected in the notes
and on labeled artifacts, but may have had the unfortunate result of

inspection of the surface of 41HI111, heavily wooded at that time,
showed very little surface artifactual material and no evidence of
areas where artifacts might be buried.
Because of
this,
no
investigations were carried out during the 1982 season.

25-5

41Hllll

In mid-1982, when this author returned to examine cleared areas
in the lake bottoms, a quick scan showed newly exposed cultural
material on the surface. Although the paucity of surface material
precluded a general surface collection because the sample would have
been too smal I to be statistically meaningful, it was decided to
briefly examine the subsurface stratigraphy. Thus, in late 1982, when
TAS returned to conduct a Data Management Survey, a brief period was
set aside for testing. Partly because it was late in the project and
partly because it is a somewhat different landform than the two sites
to the north, it was approached differently than the others. While
the other two sites had smal I bench or fan areas that I imited choice
of excavation areas, 41HI111 has a broad, generally flat alluvial fan
with few indications of cultural materials on the surface. Because of
this, 14 shovel tests were conducted at 5 and 10 meter intervals (with
one 20 meter interval between shovel tests 12 and 13) across the lower
slope area (Fig. 25.2).
Although no artifacts were recovered from
these shovel tests, which ranged in depth from 20 to 55 centimeters, a
possible buried soi I was observed in several and a smal I piece of
burned chert was found in Shovel Test 2.
A 1 by 2 meter excavation unit was placed next to Shovel Test 2,
which had yielded the burned chert (Fig. 25.2). One half of the unit,
designated as TP 1, was excavated in ten centimeter arbitrary levels
down to 40 centimeters below the surface, into apparently sterile
reddish-brown clay. Levels 1 and 4 of this unit contained no cultural
material, while levels 2 and 3 yielded a smal I amount of debitage and
a smal I bifacial tool. The second half of the 1 by 2, a meter square,
designated TP 2, was excavated immediately to the north. In this half
of the 1 by 2 unit, natural stratigraphy was uti Ii zed.
First, the
f i I I above the suspected surface, which had apparently yielded no
cultural material in the previous 1 meter unit, was excavated as one
vertical unit, then the contact area itself and the soi I below it were
excavated as a second vertical unit. Very I ittle cultural material
was found anywhere in the second half, much less at the level of the
possible buried surface. Because of a miniscule amount of cultural
material found in these units, they are treated as a single 1 by 2
unit in the remainder of this chapter except where the separation is
relevant to the discussion.
Only after the subsurface testing was completed
was
the
floodplain portion of the site, below the 158 meter (370.6 ft.)
elevation contour on the site map (Fig. 25.2), discovered.
Although
no surface collection had been planned, because of the lack of surface
material density, selected chert tools and ceramics was collected from
the lower portion as the site was mapped. Unfortunately, no field
time remained for subsurface investigations in this area.

41HI111
No record is avai I able of the total number of man days expended
during the surface collection of this site in 1980, but a total of ten
man days were expended during Apri I, October and December of 1982.
SITE STRATIGRAPHY
As observed by Lynott and Peter (1977), the cultural material on
the upper portion of 41HI111 is essentially surficial. Testing in
1982 on the old terrace/alluvial fan portion revealed some subsurface
materials.
Shovel
testing indicated a very complex surficial
stratigraphy, with a history of microf luvial cut and f i I I sequences on
the eroded surface of the old terrace.
The complexity of this
sequence is i I lustrated by the differences in profiles recorded from
shovel tests at the site. Brief descriptions of these shovel tests
are included below.

Both of the upper two strata in this unit are obviously related
to the microf luvial cut and fi I I sequences mentioned above and may
date to the Historic Period. The lower zone, originally thought to be
the eroded tread of the old alluvial terrace, might also be related to
Pleistocene or early Holocene alluvial fan deposition on the deeply
buried terrace surface. In any case, it appears that the lower clay
stratum predates aboriginal occupation at the site. This orange brown
clay (or clay loam or sandy clay loam) is the lowest stratum in most
of the shovel tests, with the exception of a few that apparently
contained deeper deposits of recent f i I I and those near the top of the
old terrace area that were underlain by a reddish-brown clay loam
thought to be col luvium from the Woodbine Formation hi I lside above
this.
Only a few widely scattered flakes were observed on the surface
in the area tested by the shovel probes. The discovery of buried
cultural material was at first thought to be significant;
however,
careful examination of the strata strongly indicated that these
artifacts were redeposited as part of the sandy f i I I left on the
eroded clay surface of the old terrace/alluvial fan deposits.

are from the test unit excavation, while the 1980 specimens were all
recovered from the surface. Three of the secondary flakes have cortex
platforms, three have single facet platforms, six have multiple facet
platforms and one specimen has a crushed platform.
Two of the
tertiary specimens have single facet platforms and two have multiple
facet platforms. Three secondary and two tertiary specimens are
lipped. One secondary flake from the 1980 collection is quartzite and
a tertiary specimen from the same year is thermally altered.
Seven of the 13 chips were collected in 1980;

surface of the site. Five of the six 1982 specimens were recovered
from the test excavation unit. One specimen from 1980 1s quartzite
and none are thermally altered.

The three cores were al I collected from the surface during the

Two are multidirectional specimens while the third is

Al I three
specimens are smal I;
average weight is 44.5 grams, with a range
between 31.6 grams and 51.8 grams. Average length is 5.2 centimeters,
average width 1s 4.0 centimeters and average thickness is 2.4
centimeters.
Modified Debitage/Informal Tools
Only two specimens of modified debitage were collected, both from
the general surface collection, one in 1980 and the other from 1982.
Both exhibit Type 2 attrition. On both specimens, modification 1s
unifacial on the dorsal surface. Edge outline of one is convex, while
the modification of the other is a projection. The former specimen is
a chip, while the latter is of indeterminate origin, possibly being a
core rather than a flake or chip.
Formal Tools
BIFACES (4 specimens)
Four bi faces were collected from 41HI111, three from 1980 and one
in 1982.
This group includes one thick biface, classified here as a
roughout (Fig. 25.4a).
This is a freehand percussion specimen,
manufactured from a crude grainy chert. The remaining three are thin
bi faces, and include one smal I indeterminate specimen, one medial
fragment, perhaps from near the distal end of a dart point, and a
smal I subtriangular fragment missing a smal I portion of its distal
end, that appears to be an arrow point preform (Fig. 25.4b). The
latter specimen was recovered from the surface in 1982.
PROJECTILE POINTS (9 specimens)
This group includes six specimens collected from the 1980 and
1982 seasons of investigation, as well as three specimens collected
during the 1972 SMU investigations. Al I three of the SMU specimens
are dart points.
Both of the 1980 specimens are dart points, while
only one of the four projectile points from the 1982 season is a dart
point.

Arrow Points (3 specimens)
Cliffton-like (1 specimen)
This fragmentary specimen (Fig. 25.4c) is smaller than most
Cliffton points and is similar primarily in its crudeness and
contracting stem. It has an asymmetrical blade, moderately prominent,
outward projecting shoulders and a short, broad contracting stem. The
distal end is missing, apparently from a recent fracture.
This
specimen was recovered from the floodplain/alluvial terrace interface
area during the 1982 surface collection. Rather than a crude finished
arrow point, this specimen may be an unfinished preform.
Miscellaneous Round stemmed (1 specimen)
This single specimen (Fig. 25.4d), recovered from the surface of
the floodplain portion of the site in 1982, shows strong resemblances
to the Miscellaneous Round stemmed specimens recovered from the
McDonald Site (41HI105). It has a triangular blade (missing a small
portion of the distal end), prominent shoulders and a para I lei sided,
round based stem.
It has a piano-convex cross section and is
manufactured from an unusual reddish-tan speckled chert (or fine
grained quartzite?).
Miscellaneous Triangular (1 specimen)
This arrow point (Fig. 25.4e) was also collected from the surface
of the floodplain area in 1982. It has a narrow triangular blade with
a square, unstemmed base. This wel I made specimen is thought to be a
finished projectile point rather than a preform based on the qua I ity
of workmanship, and is comparable to similar specimens found near the
bottom of the Late Prehistoric occupation levels at the McDonald Site
(41HI105).
Dart Points (6 specimens)
Martindale-like (1 specimen)
This single specimen (Fig. 25.4f) was recovered from the surface
of the upper portion of the site (the original x41HI86) in 1972. It
has a narrow triangular blade with convex blade edges, moderately
prominent shoulders, and a moderately expanding stem with a concave
stem base. The concavity of the base has a hint of the recurve that
is the diagnostic feature of the Martindale type (Suhm and Jelks
1962), but this feature is not definite. This specimen also seems to
be larger, heavier and thicker than is usual for Martindale points.
Base and stem edges are I ightly ground.

Pedernales-1 ike (1 specimen)
This specimen (Fig. 25.4g) was also collected from the upper
portion of the site during the 1972 SMU survey. It has a narrow blade
(missing the distal portion), weak shoulders, a parallel sided stem
and a strongly concave base. Stem edges and base are wel I smoothed.
The stem is similar to the Pedernales type, but the blade is much
narrower than is usual (Suhm and Jelks 1962). The blade may possibly
be reworked.
Broad Expanding stemmed (1 specimen)
This specimen (Fig. 25.4h), recovered 1n 1982 from the old
terrace surface near the edge of the modern floodplain, is a basal
fragment, retaining only a portion of the blade above the moderate
shoulders.
The remaining blade is wide and slightly asymmetrical.
The shoulders are also moderately asymmetrical.
The stem expands
somewhat and has a square base. The width of the blade and the broad
stem resemble several Castrovi I le-I ike specimens identified from the
Aqui I la Lake area, but the defining barbs are absent and the stem,
while broad, is not as broad as others of this type (Suhm and Jelks
1962).
Morphologically and technologically, however, this specimen
resembles others from the reservoir area and may date to the same time
period.
Narrow Expanding stemmed (1 specimen)
This specimen (Fig. 25.4i), collected from the upper portion of
the site during the 1972 survey, bears some resemblance to the
Yarbrough type (Suhm and Jelks 1962) but is not felt to be close
enough to classify.
It has a narrow triangular blade (missing the
distal portion), moderately prominent shoulders and a moderately
expanding stem with a straight base.
Para I lei stemmed (2 specimens)
Both of these specimens were collected from the surface during
the 1980 investigations. One (Fig. 25.4j) has a wide triangular blade
with prominent, almost barbed, shoulders and a para I lei sided stem.
The base of the stem has been broken, it is impossible to classify
this specimen. The second point (Fig. 25.4k) has a slightly narrower
blade than the above described specimen, with moderately prominent,
almost barbed, shoulders and a long, narrow para I lei sided stem with a
square
base.
Although
not classifiable into any established
projectile point type, these long, narrow stemmed specimens are not
infrequent in the Aqui I la Lake area.

GROUND AND BATTERED STONE
Hammerstones (3 specimens)
Two of these specimens, both from the 1982 surface collection,
are smal I cobble hammerstones. One is discoidal shaped with wear on
two opposing ends, the other is more ovoid with wear also occurring at
two ends.
The third apparent hammerstone is coarse grained purple
quartzite with several flakes removed bifacial ly from one end and

slightly cylindrical with a groove worn across its midsection that may
possibly be intentional. This specimen bears some resemblance to the
heavily worn quartzite choppers discussed elsewhere in this report,
included variously with bifaces, unifaces and ground stone. It seems
however, because of its shape and wear pattern, to be an example of
what Sol I berger (1968:99) has cal led a hand hammer.
Grooved Stone (1 specimen)
This single small pebble (Fig. 25.41) has one flat face and a
groove scratched 360 degrees around the specimen parallel to the edge
of the flat face. Looking at wear on one side of the flat face it may
be possible that this face was removed, intentionally or not, after
the edge was partially scored para I lel to the rema1n1ng groove.
It
may have functioned as a net sinker or bolo stone but is not a Waco
Sinker.
CERAMICS
Five ceramic sherds were collected from the floodplain area 1n
1982.
Al I are plain body sherds and cannot be readily identified as

separate vessels. A brief description of these specimens fol lows.

FAUNAL REMAINS
Two fragments of a large mammal vertebra were recovered from
level 3 of the western half of the 1 by 2 meter test pit. Although
these cannot be definitely identified to species, they are within the
bovid size range and are referred to as Bos species. Fragments of a
large mammal mandible and one tooth were cOiTected from the surface of
the site just north of Shovel Test 3. The mandible fragments are
unidentified, but the tooth is the lower left rear molar of a bovid,
most probably Bos Taurus. The presence of the latter on the surface
is no surprise, but the association of bovid bones with prehistoric
chipping debris in a subsurface context is somewhat unusual. The soi I
conditions in the upper portion of the old terrace sediments should
not favor bone preservation, and very I ittle fauna I materials have
been recovered from similar contexts in the Central Brazos region.

41HI111
While this site may be an anomaly 1n this respect, it is more likely
that this 1s another indication of disturbances 1n its shallow
sediments.
SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The sample of artifactual materials from 41HI111 is too small to
attempt a definitive characterization of this site. Several tentative
statements can be made on the basis of comparisons with adjacent sites
in environmental similarly settings (41HI109, 41HI110). One important
distinction must be made though, between 41Hllll and its neighbors to
the north.
41HI111 is a larger composite site that crosscuts
environmental zones from hi I I side to floodplain much more broadly than
either of the other sites. Although it has an upland slope component
similar environmentally to that found in the upper portion of 41HI110,
particularly to the south in the area of old x41HI85, it has a much
larger segment of old alluvial terrace abutting the hi I I slope to the
west than either 41HI109 or 41HI110. In addition, the floodplain
portion of 41HI111 is closer to the modern channel of the creek than
at either of the other two sites. Because of these physiographic
differences, as wel I as perceived differences in the cultural remains,
the three maJor topographic areas of the site are discussed separately
below.
The upland slope portion of 41HI111, the area originally recorded
by SMU as x41HI86 and tested by Lynott and Peter (1977) in 1975, is
essentially identical to the upland southern portion of 41HI110.
The
density of surficial cultural remains, however, is greater on the
41HI110 side of the deeply incised drainage that separates the two
sites.
A significant factor in this difference is the enormously
greater exposure on 41HI110, due to the severely eroded badlands
topography which enhances artifact visibi I ity. Subjective observation
of artifact density in areas of approximately equivalent ground cover
suggests that the density difference is real, but this cannot be
conclusively demonstrated here. The only observable difference that
might be responsible for the different occupation histories is the
presence of a slightly steeper creek bank on the southern (41HI111)
side of the drainage.
If this is the case, then it suggests that
access to the creek was relatively important and, more importantly,
that the drainage may have been a flowing stream more often than it is
today.
Although the upper terrace portion of 41HI111 was obviously a
locus of prehistoric activities, it has been so disturbed by erosion
and comp I icated by prehistoric and historic cut and f i I I sequences, as
wel I as modern bulldozing for forest clearing, that it is impossible
to say much about activities in this area other than the density of
25-17

41HI111
cultural material is low. Unfortunately, the portion of this landform
with the greatest potential for aboriginal use, along the banks of the
intermittent drainage that separates 41HI111 from 41HI110 to the
north, has been most disturbed by clearing
and
water
tower
construction activities. A marked increase in density of occupational
debris near the base of this old terrace/alluvial fan slope is
unquestionably related to the occupations in the adjacent floodplain
area.
The fact that the floodplain portion of this site was not
discovered unti I near the end of the field project is indeed
unfortunate and leaves several important questions unanswered. It 1s
clear,
however,
that this area was occupied during the Late
Prehistoric. No Late Prehistoric diagnostics were recovered from
else on the site but the floodplain, although this
anywhere
distribution may be no more than sampling error since Late Prehistoric
diagnostics were found in upland and alluvial terrace portions of
nearby 41HI109 and 41HI110. Nonetheless, the floodplain portion of
41HI111 exhibited a relatively dense concentration of surficial
cultural remains, almost al I of whose associated diagnostics were Late
Prehistoric in age; one possible Archaic dart point that might also
be a Late Prehistoric stemmed knife is the only contradictory
evidence.
That this area was a habitation site is suggested by a
large metate fragment observed on the surface and an apparent hearth
eroding from the bank of the artificial drain channel, cut for the
water tower intake works. In addition to the apparent hearth, a
disturbed concentration of burned rock and minute amounts of charcoal,
scattered burned rock and mussel shel I, were noted along the edge of
the channel and on the scraped surface of the floodplain. None of
this material was collected.
The sediments visible in the profile of the artificial drain cut
indicate that this area is the modern floodplain of Hackberry Creek
and points to the site being buried at a shallow depth.
The most
tel I ing evidence for this is the fact that cultural material is only
visible where bulldozers have cut below the original ground surface.
Although the site appears to be buried in the floodplain, clearly it
is not buried nearly so deeply as the McDonald Site only several
hundred meters upstream.
Depth of the cultural material in the
floodplain at 41HI111 could not be more than 20 to 30 centimeters
compared to the 50 to 70 centimeters seen at the McDonald Site.
Several explanations for this differential depth are possible.
One is that the floodplain portion of 41HI111 is much later and
therefore closer to the ground surface.
The pottery recovered at
41HI111 has a very different paste from any found at the McDonald Site
and it would not be surprising if it belonged to a different time
period.
If anything, the arrow points recovered from 41HI111 suggest
25-18

41HI111
that this site may be equivalent to the earlier Late Prehistoric
occupation
levels
at
41HI105.
A second explanation for the
differential depth is greater deposition at the McDonald Site, due to
Â·turbulence caused by the smal I tributary that separates the areas of
the site (see Watson 1982). This may be the case, but it is suggested
that this tributary is too smal I to cause such a difference,
particularly when 41HI111 appears to be adjacent to a lateral
tributary of almost equal magnitude. It is suggested here that the
most I ikely explanation involves the distance of both sites from
Hackberry Creek and the process of levee formation. A distinct levee
formation is present at the McDonald Site, where the thickness of the
sterile cap is greater on the creekward side of the smal I tributary
(Area 8). The floodplain cultural materials at 41HI111 are far enough
from the modern creek that the coarser levee sediments would not be a
factor and deposition would be slower. This fact suggests that either
41HI111 was located some distance from Hackberry Creek when originally
occupied, perhaps along the smal I channel of the lateral tributary, or
that the creek channel shifted to its modern location not long after
occupation of the site. Extensive trenching and excavation would be
needed to select between these two possibilities.

BAILEY SITE - 41HI77
Richard P. Watson

SITE DESCRIPTION
The Bailey Site is in the Eastern Cross Timbers biotic zone on
the T3 terrace on the right bank of Aqui I la Creek (Fig. 26.1). It 1s
approximately 7 meters above and 20 meters west of the modern stream
bed at an elevation of about 162 meters (531 ft.) MSL. The main part
of the site I ies along a relatively flat ridge that slopes gradually
from northeast to southwest. According to Skinner et al. (1978:70),
the site was cultivated before about 1942, but has been abandoned
since that time and al lowed to revert to the native vegetation. It is
now covered by a variety of grasses and scattered trees, including
mesquite, post oak and hackberry. The surrounding lowland forest is
typical of this biotic zone as described 1n Chapter 2.
As defined by Lynott and Peter (1975), the site covers a total
area of about 2700 square meters.
The greatest concentration of
material, however, appears confined to the flat ridge top in an area
of only about 320 square meters.
SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK
This site was first recorded by
as his site number 4. At the time
cultivation and a surface collection
I ithic materials, including a number

of initial discovery it was under
yielded a variety of diagnostic
of Waco Sinkers.

The site was recorded again and tested in 1975 by Lynott and
Peter (1975:96-100) (site x41HI99), who excavated eight shovel tests
and eight 1 by 1 meter test pits. A 60 by 60 meter area, encompassing
the
entire site and a portion of the adjacent Aqui I la Creek
floodplain, was gridded into nine 20 by 20 meter sampling units.
The
sampling unit falling in the northeast corner was excluded as it was
largely confined to the floodplain. One 1 by 1 meter test pit was

then randomly placed rn each of the eight rema1n1ng sampling units.
Each pit was excavated in arbitrary 10 centimeter levels.
These
investigations determined that the western portion of the site is
highly eroded, and that historic agricultural practices have severely
mixed the cultural materials.
In 1977, additional work was conducted by SMU (Skinner et al.
1978:70-76).
Sixteen 1 by 1 meter units (Fig. 26.2) were excavated,
primarily along the central ridge, in 10 centimeter arbitrary levels.
A 1 by 2 meter profile cut was also excavated into the top of the
cutbank that forms the northeastern edge of the site. In addition, 18
or 19 shovel tests and an undetermined number of postholes, were
excavated to further define the site I imits and stratigraphy.
Five
sandstone
block
features
were
exposed by these excavations.
Unfortunately, no plans or photographs of these are given in the
published report, nor is their location within the site described or
i I lustrated.
On the basis of eight temporally diagnostic projectile points, it
was determined that the Bailey Site is a multicomponent site occupied
during the Transitional Early Archaic (6000
3500 B.C.), Early
Archaic (3500
2000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (2000 - 1000 B.C.),
Transitional Archaic (A.O. 1 - 600), Austin Focus (A.O. 600 -1300),
and Toyah Focus (A.O. 1300 - 1500) (Skinner et al. 1978:113).
DATA COLLECTION
The two 2 by 2 meter units (A and B) excavated during the 1980
investigations were located relative to the site grid established by
the 1977 SMU investigators, the north-south axis of which actually
runs north-northwest to south-southeast at 25 degrees west of north.
In order to expose features and intact stratigraphy, the two units
were placed 1 meter apart along a I ine para I lel to the western edge of
the easternmost SMU units (Fig. 26.2). High densities of artifactual
material and burned sandstone had been recovered from these units
during the 1977 investigations. Fi I I was removed in 10 centimeter
levels by shovel skimming and troweling.
Al I f i I I was screened
through 1/4 inch mesh hardware cloth.
Unit A
This entire unit was excavated to a depth of 30 centimeters,
which approximates the upper boundary of a massive hard silty clay
loam, the 822 horizon. Due to a substantial reduction in the quantity
of cultural materials recovered and the increased difficulty of
excavating this soi I horizon, only the eastern 1 by 2 meter half was

MATERIAL CULTURE
Cultural Features
Two features were defined during the 1980 excavations, one in
each excavation unit. They are believed to be parts of a single large
feature.
FEATURE 1
Feature 1 is a large, dispersed, I inear concentration of burned
tabular sandstone and quartzite, and chert cobbles (Fig. 26.4). A
large number of flakes and chips, as wel I as two biface fragments, an
arrow point body fragment, a hammerstone, and several smal I pieces of
bone, some of which were burned, and bone and mussel shel I fragments
were recovered from this feature and the surrounding f i I I. Feature 1
is roughly trapezoidal in shape and extends completely across Unit A
from east to west. It narrows from approximately 2 meters wide on the
east to about 0.5 meter wide on the west. The greatest concentration
of burned rocks, artifacts and I ithic debris was recovered in level 2,
between 14 and 18 centimeters below the surface.
Several of the larger pieces of tabular sandstone were lying flat
on a paleosurface 16 to 18 centimeters below the modern ground
surface. The arrangement is similar to that of a flagstone paving and
appears to have been intentional. Oxidation of the upper surfaces of
the tabular sandstone, in situ fracturing, and the presence of smal I
charcoal flecks, sugges~burning. No burned earth was found, however.
The tabular sandstone that forms the principal component of this
feature appears to be derived from outcrops of the Woodbine Formation
that occur in the immediate vicinity.
The lesser quantities of
quartzite and chert cobbles were almost certainly carried to the site
from Uvalde gravel lag deposits on the T3 terraces and higher
interf luvial areas in this region.
FEATURE 2
This feature is structurally very similar to Feature 1.
Its
form, however, is more diffuse, and it covers al I of Unit B. The
density of burned sandstone is lower than in Unit A, and there are no
areas similar to the flagstone paving of Feature 1. The density of
artifactual remains, however, is much higher (Table 26.1).

greatest concentrations of material were found 1n the northern half
and southeastern quarter of the unit in levels 2, 3, and 4, extending
from approximately 16 to 40 centimeters below the present ground
surface. In the southern half of Unit B, the stratum containing what
appears to be undisturbed cultural material dips about 16 centimeters
from west to east.
FEATURES:

DISCUSSION

As noted, it is very I ikely that the definition of two features
is an artifact of excavation and they are only parts of a single, much
larger, feature. On the basis of these excavations and the earlier
work conducted by SMU, it appears that a large area of burned rock and
associated materials covers an area of at least 6 by 6 meters.
From
the exposed portions of this feature, it is not possible to define its
exact nature, but several hypotheses can be offered.
Not al I of the sandstone appears to have been subjected to high
temperatures. The Woodbine sandstone oxidizes naturally when exposed,
and the feature material has a higher degree of oxidation than is the
case with sandstone collected from nearby outcrops. As might be
26-8

BAILEY SITE
expected, the smaller fragments (fist sized and smaller) are generally
more highly oxidized than the larger tabular pieces. It might be
argued that the larger pieces, some of which are burned on their upper
surface, represent the raw material for hearth construction or were
warming or boi I ing stones. Such stones might also be used as a means
of providing warmth for sleeping and/or heating a smal I structure
without the danger of an open fire. If this were the case, it might
be expected that discrete concentrations of burned stones would be
found.
While it was not possible to positively
define
such
accumulations, three smal I concentrations of stones in Unit B might be
the result of such activities.
Skinner et al. (1978) have suggested that the part of the
feature exposed during their excavations might represent a hearth.
However, since no burned areas were encountered suggesting 1n situ
burning, the material was probably cleaned out from a hearth.
As was noted by Skinner (Skinner et al.
1978:76),
the
stratigraphic integrity of the archeological deposits at this site is
highly suspect. Table 26.2 i I lustrates the degree of m1x1ng present
relative to the presumed stratigraphic relationships of recognized
types in the arbitrary excavation levels.
The temporal placement of this feature
is
difficult
as
insufficient charcoal was avai I able for radiometric assay.
The
presence of a wide variety of temporally diagnostic projectile points,
from TAS excavations and previous work (Bryan 1937, ms.; Skinner et
al. 1978:70-76), further complicates such a determination.
The presence of a burned Gary projectile point indicates that the
intense burning evidenced on the sandstone composing this feature
occurred subsequent to the manufacture of this point.
Unfortunately,
the
Gary
point type (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks 1954) 1s not
particularly useful as a temporal indicator.
The relative size of
~
points has been suggested as a temporally sensitive attribute
(Ford and Webb 1956; Johnson 1962). The smal I size of the recovered
specimen may therefore indicate a relatively late occupation. It
cannot be conclusively demonstrated that the burning responsible for
the heat fracturing of this point was contemporaneous with that
affecting the feature since the point was found in the screen. It is
I ikely that both the feature and the Gary point were burned during the
same event(s), given that the point was recovered from the same level
as much of the burned sandstone. If this association, is, in fact,
real, then this feature probably dates to the Late Archaic.
Such a
placement is in accord with the Archaic date assigned to a very
similar feature at the Old Union Bridge Site 1n Limestone County
(Mal louf 1979:15, 20).

Lithic Debris
The I ithic assemblage from the Bailey Site is divided into two
major categories:
flaked stone, and ground and battered stone.
Flaked stone is further divided into debitage (flakes, chips and
cores),
modified
debitage
(informal tools), and formal tools
(projectile points and bifacial tools). Ground and battered stone is
divided into hammerstones and miscellaneous ground and battered
stones. Below, each major section 1s fol lowed by an interpretive
summary and discussion.
The total I ithic assemblage includes 6537 specimens, of which the
flaked stone debitage comprises 97.3% (6354) and modified debitage
1.8% (121). The remaining 0.9% is made up of 56 flaked stone formal
tools, 1 hammerstone, 1 chopper/crusher, and 2 notched stones (Waco
Sinkers). As was noted, the deposits at this site are probably mixed;
therefore,
the
I ithic debitage has been treated as a single
assemblage.
FLAKED STONE
Unmodified Debitage
The vast majority of materials recovered from the Bailey Site
fall into this category.
Within this, 47.8% are flakes, 51.8% are
chips, and 0.3% are cores. Unmodified debitage was recovered from
both excavation units.
FLAKES (3041 specimens)
The 3041 flakes were divided into three morphological categories:
primary, secondary and tertiary flakes. Each flake was then coded for
each of the five variables described. Finally, the distribution of
the various flake categories was determined for each excavation unit.
Primary Flakes (73 specimens)
Primary flakes comprise 2.4% of the total flake collection.
While they occurred 1n both excavation units, by far the largest
number (56, 76.7%) are from Unit B (Table 26.1).
There is no
significant difference in the number of flakes recovered from each
level of this unit. Most of the primary flakes are of chert (68),
only five (4 quartzite and 1 hematite) are of other materials. By
definition, al I primary flakes have cortex platforms.
Nine of the
primary flakes (12.3%) have I ips on the ventral surface of the
platform.

26-11

BAILEY SITE

Secondary Flakes (1456 specimens)
Secondary flakes were analyzed for the type of platform, presence
of a ventral platform I ip and the type of material. Al I five of the
defined platform types occur on these flakes (Table V.22). Cortex and
single facet platforms are about equally common, 30.0% (439) and 26.8%
(393) respectively. Multiple facet platforms comprise the majority
with a total of 565 (38.4%), while crushed and ground platform flakes
comprise the rema1n1ng 70 flakes, 67 and 3 respectively.
The
relatively high percentage of primary flakes and cortex platforms on
secondary flakes suggests that the decortication of source materials
occurred on the site. A total of 463 secondary flakes have ventral
platform I ips (Table V.23).
Chert comprised 94.7% (1388) of the
material for secondary flakes (Table 26.5).
Tertiary Flakes (1503 specimens)
As with the secondary flakes, tertiary flakes were analyzed for
the type of platform, presence of a ventral platform I ip and type of
material. Four of the five types of platforms were found on these
flakes (Table V.22).
The fifth, cortex platform, was excluded by
definition. By their nature, tertiary flakes are more I ikely to have
a higher proportion of multiple facet platforms than secondary flakes
have, since more flakes have been removed during the process of core
reduction. I the assemblage from the Bailey Site, this proportion is
approximately 5 to 3. There is no significant difference between the
percentages of single facet platforms on secondary and tertiary
flakes.
There are, however, important differences between
the
rema1n1ng three types of platforms (Table V.22). Multiple facet
platforms occur on 62.9% of the tertiary flakes, but only on 38.4% of
the secondary flakes.
While ground and crushed platforms comprise
only a smal I percentage of platforms on both of these
flake
categories,
the
differences may reflect variations in flaking
technology. A more complete discussion of these imp I ications 1s
presented below.
Ventral platform lips are found on 568 (37.8%) of the tertiary
flakes.
A comparison of the percentages of flakes with lips, in the
secondary and tertiary flake categories, indicates that platform
preparation resulting in faceted platforms was more common during the
middle and later stages of tool production.
An analysis of stone types of tertiary flakes again shows that
chert is by far the most common material at the Ba-iley Site,
comprising 94.4% (2619) of the tertiary flakes (Table V.24).

BAILEY SITE
Flakes:

Discussion

This comparison of flake characteristics provides a useful
insight into the prehistoric flaked stone technology represented at
the Bailey Site. As noted, the most significant variation in platform
type occurs in the relatively smal I categories of ground and crushed.
The low percentage of ground platforms on both secondary and tertiary
flakes shows that grinding or abrading as a means of platform
preparation was uncommon. The lack of abraders from this site also
supports this observation.
The larger percentage of crushed platforms on tertiary, as
contrasted with that on secondary flakes, may be the result of the use
of a hard hammer on the thinner tertiary flakes.
Alternatively, the
use of I ittle or no platform preparation, perhaps associated with hard
hammer percussion during the later stages of I ithic reduction, might
result in an increase in crushed platforms.
Henry, Haynes, and
Bradley (1976) however, found no difference in the proportion of
crushed platforms between soft and hard hammer percussion.
A significant increase 1n the percentage
of
multifaceted
platforms on tertiary flakes (Table 26.3) over that on secondary
flakes may indicate the use of pressure flaking or perpendicular edge
abrasion; that is, the abrasion of a core or preform edge by dragging
a hammerstone or abrader across it perpendicular to the primary edge
axis.
Both of these techniques produce smal I flake scars along the
platform edge, and hence a greater number of multiple platform flakes
removed from it.
The proportion of multiple facet platforms which can be directly
attributed to platform preparation relative to those attributable to
the nature of tertiary flakes cannot be determined at this time.
A
detailed study of platform facet characteristics in conjunction with
experimental and comparative studies could shed I ight on
this
question, but such a study was beyond the scope of the present
research. In an experimental study of flake characteristics, Henry,
Haynes, and Bradley (1976) recorded a higher percentage of lipped
platforms on flakes produced by soft hammer percussion than on those
produced by hard hammer percussion, 19.6% versus 1.3% respectively.
The relatively high percentage (34.2%) of lipped platforms at the
Bailey Site suggests that soft hammer percussion was an integral part
of the flaked stone technology.
The analysis of types of material shows that several varieties of
chert, probably derived from the local Uvalde gravels, were the
preferred I ithic materials.
Chert comprises 94.5% (2875) of the
flakes. Of the remaining 5.5% (166), only 0.75% (23 specimens) appear
to be of non-local chalcedony.

CHIPS (3292 specimens)
SI ightly more than half of the entire I ithic assemblage (50.4%)
consisted of chips. Two variables were recorded for this category of
I ithic debitage, material type and thermal alteration, using the same
values as those for flakes. As in the case of the flake analysis,
thermal alteration was used as an indicator of intentional alteration
of I ithic materials. In retrospect, a division of chips into the same
cortex classes as those uti I ized for flakes, primary, secondary and
tertiary, would have been useful.
The vertical and horizontal patterning of the chips closely
fol lows that of the flakes.
On the other hand, a chi-square
comparison of the frequencies of the various material categories
indicates that there are significant differences between flakes and
chips (Table 26.4). These results indicate that the breakage of
flakes, resulting in chips, occurs at differential rates for some or
al I of the I ithic materials.
A comparison of the observed and
expected values from Table 26.4 indicates that in al I cases, with the
exception of chert, flakes are more common in the collected sample
than is predicted by the random model. These results and a comparison
of the relative frequencies of material categories for flakes and
chips, indicates that chert is more I ikely to produce broken flakes
than are any of the other I ithic materials used.
The higher
proportion of chert chips may be the result of the generally poor
qua I ity of the locally available materials that constitutes most of
the I ithic debitage at this site.
Chips are of limited uti I ity 1n the definition of I ithic
technologies since they lack that part most readily control led and
modified by the flint knapper, the platform.
As part of a larger
debitage assemblage, however, chips may provide useful information.
For example, the proportion of c~ips to flakes, or to various classes
of flakes, might indicate the use of hard versus soft hammer
percussion. Continued experimentation such as that conducted by
Henry, Haynes, and Bradley (1976) wi I I be required to answer such
questions. Unti I such time as more information is available, chips
wi I I serve largely to support conclu~ions reached from the analysis of
the other categories of debitage.
CORES (22 specimens)
As noted in an earlier section, al I of the cores were produced by
freehand percussion.
Of the 22 cores and core fragments, 5 show
unidirectional flaking, 12 have multidirectional flaking, 2 have
bifacial flaking and 1 is a tested cobble (Table V.25). These cores

26-15

BAILEY SITE
range in length from 26 mi I I imeters to 62 mi I limeters and have a mean
thickness of 21 mi I I imeters (Table V.25). Al I but one are of fine
grained chert.
The distribution of cores and core fragments is highly skewed, 20
coming from Unit Band only 2 from Unit A. Both specimens from Unit A
were from the upper 10 centimeters. The specimens from Unit B were
fairly evenly distributed 1n the top three levels (0-30 cm) (Table
V.25).
platform
Eleven of the cores show two or more kinds of
preparation.
Flakes removed from cortex platforms occur on 10 cores
and the tested cobble. Single facet platforms are found on 18 cores.
Multiple facet platforms, probably resulting from perpendicular edge
abrasion, occur on seven cores. Grinding as platform preparation is
found on only one core. One core of fine grained chert has battering,
indicative of use as a hammerstone or chopper subsequent to its use as
a core.
This specimen wi I I be discussed further in the modified
debitage section.
Multidirectional Cores (12 specimens)
Multidirectional cores comprise 54.5% of al I
cores.
Al I
specimens are of fine grained cherts from the local Uvalde gravels.
Their smal I size is undoubtedly a reflection of the original size of
the cobbles (Table V.26).
Al I multidirectional cores have faceted
platforms, half have cortex platforms, and a single core has grinding.
Bidirectional Cores (2 specimens)
Both bidirectional cores are of chert and were recovered from
level 3 (20-30 cm) of Unit B. They are very different in size. The
larger one has both cortex and single facet platforms, while the
smaller has only the latter (Table V.25).
Unidirectional Cores (5 specimens)
Unidirectional cores are the second most common type, compr1s1ng
24% of al I cores from the site. Al I unidirectional cores are of
chert. Cortex platforms, single facet platforms, and multiple facet
platforms each occur on two cores. One unidirectional core shows
battering (Table V.27).
Bifacial Cores (2 specimens)
Both bifacial cores from the Bailey Site are smal I and may be
fragments of larger cores or bifacial tools (Table V.25). One core 1s
of crystal quartz and the other of a fine grained chert.
Both have
single facet platforms.

Cores:

Discussion

The analysis of cores and core fragments from the Bailey Site
generally
supports
the
results
of the flake analysis.
The
correspondence of the distributions of flakes and cores is striking
and may indicate a localized activity area or a refuse dump.
Twenty-one of 22 cores, as wel I as 65% of al I flakes and chips, were
recovered from Unit B.
Modified Debitage/Informal Tools
The modified debitage comprises 1.85% of the entire lithic
assemblage.
It consists of 1 modified core, 2 modified indeterminate
I ithic fragments (shatter), 61 flakes and 50 chips. Both Type 1 and
Type 2 attrition, as wel I as a single case of battering, are found on
these specimens. Three facets show both Type 1 and Type 2 attrition.
One specimen has Type 2 attrition only.
TYPE 1 ATTRITION (108 specimens, 126 facets)
Sixteen of the 108 specimens with Type 1 attrition have two
separate facets, and one has three facets. Chips have 44.4% (56
facets) of al I Type 1 facets, secondary flakes have 38.9% (44 facets),
and tertiary flakes have 16.7% (21 facets).
Type 1 attrition in this assemblage 1s attributed to cutting,
scraping, boring and battering. Scraping accounts for three-fourths
of al I Type 1 facets, while cutting accounts for 24 facets (19.0%).
Boring accounts for 5.5%, or seven facets. The materials worked
include al I four classes of hardness: soft, soft medium, hard medium,
and hard. Soft medium materials have 74 (58.7%) of the Type 1 facets;
soft materials have 35 (27.8%). Hard medium materials have 14 (11.1%)
and hard materials have 3 (2.4%).
Seven separate facet edge out I ines were recorded for the debitage
that has Type 1 attrition. The most common were straight, convex and
irregular, which are found on over 80% of al I Type 1 facet out I ines.
Straight to irregular lateral edges were preferred for cutting
activities, and straight or convex, lateral and distal edges, were
preferred for scraping activities.
Edge abrasion on cutting facets 1s uniformly I ight or not visible
under the magnifications used in this study. Scraping facets show a
broader range of abrasion: 46 facets have no evidence of abrasion, 2
26-17

BAILEY SITE
have polish, 43 have I ight abrasion and 4 have heavy abrasion.
facets attributed to boring al I have I ight abrasion.

The 7

TYPE 2 ATTRITION (1 specimen, 1 facet)
One specimen has only Type 2 attrition. This chip has a straight
facet that appears to have been used for scraping a soft medium
material, although it shows only light abrasion.
TYPES 1 AND 2 ATTRITION (3 specimens, 3 facets)
Three specimens have both Type 1 and Type 2 attrition on a single
facet.
Two are chips, and the third is an indeterminate I ithic
fragment. Each specimen has only a single facet.
The presence of Type 1 and Type 2 attrition on the same facet 1s
probably the result of initial shaping or retouch (Type 2) and
subsequent use (Type 1). The specimen with only Type 2 attrition
probably represents a shorter or less intensive use than do specimens
in the present category. Facets with both Type 1 and Type 2 attrition
occur most often on lateral edges.
BATTERING (1 specimen)
One modified core shows several battering facets along its flaked
margins.
It is proposed in the discussion of the materials from the
McDonald Site, where fauna I materials are preserved, that similar
objects may be formal tools intended for use in chopping or crushing
bone or freshwater mussel shel Is.
This use is suggested by the
uniformity of the fracture patterns on shel Is from sites in this area.
If these implements were intended solely for opening mussels, their
distribution should be confined mostly to sites on or near a source of
mussels. In the case of the Aqui I la Reservoir, this source includes
al I of Hackberry Creek, which maintains a year round flow, and Aqui I la
Creek from slightly above its confluence with Hackberry to its
juncture with the Brazos River. Mussels cannot survive in the narrow
sandier bed of the flood prone upper Aqui I la Creek Basin (Ful I ington
1978:215).
MODIFIED DEBITAGE/INFORMAL TOOLS:

DISCUSSION

Facets attributed to scraping comprise 75% of al I facets, while
cutting facets constitute about 20~, and boring facets only 5%. The
distribution of modified debitage closely para I lels that of the
unmodified debitage, most (75.4%) being recovered from Unit B.

26-18

BAILEY SITE
The activities responsible for producing the modified debitage at
the Bailey Site probably include cutting, scraping, boring and
battering of a wide variety of materials. The exact nature of these
activities could not be determined in the present analysis, but
probably included the fol lowing:
food processing, represented by
cutting and scraping facets used on soft and soft medium materials
(112 facets), and possibly by battering to extract bone marrow or open
fresh water mussels (1 specimen); hide processing, represented by
cutting and scraping facets used on soft or soft medium materials (112
facets), and boring of soft medium materials (7 facets); woodworking,
represented by cutting and scraping facets used on soft medium, hard
medium, and perhaps hard materials, the result of working a variety of
both hard and soft woods (97 facets); working of bone, if present,
represented by cutting and scraping facets used on hard materials (5
facets).
The absence of perishables and fauna I remains at the Bailey Site
leaves no evidence of that sort in support of these possibilities.
The association of al I the modified debitage with the large burned
rock feature in units A and B might suggest use for food processing,
but this inference is tenuous at best since there was no spatial
patterning of modified debitage within either unit, nor were there
suggestions of a specialized use area.
Formal Tools
UNIFACES (1 specimen)
One formal unifacial tool, a dri I I, was excavated from Unit B,
level 4 (Fig. 26.Sa). The bit tip of this specimen is m1ss1ng. Edge
rounding is apparent on the remaining portion. This dri I I was made by
alternately pressure flaking a tertiary flake that had a pronounced
dorsal ridge. The ridge facilitated the production of a diamond cross
section for the bit, and strengthened the entire implement. Two small
areas of Type 1 attrition on the lateral edges at the base are most
I ikely the result of prehension. The amount and intensity of edge
rounding on this specimen suggests that it was used on soft medium
materials.
BIFACES (20 specimens)
Twenty complete and fragmentary bifacial tools, other than
projectile points, were recovered from the Bailey Site (Fig. 26.6a-k).
Three specimens are whole and a fourth is broken but largely complete.

42mm x 12mm) triangular blade fragments to very smal I (7mm x 12mm x
2mm) biface edge fragments.
The complete bifaces are of three
morphologically distinct forms that probably correspond to functional
categories.
The highly fragmentary nature of most of the remaining
specimens makes classification on the basis of their morphology
difficult.
As a result, they are grouped by probable function, as
determined from an analysis of edge damage.
Form 1 (2 specimens)
Two subtriangular bifacial gouges, typologically grouped with
Erath bifaces (Story and Shafer 1965) were recovered from Unit B,
levels 2 and 3. One specimen has significant polish on the flake
ridges and surfaces adjacent to the Qit edge. Edge rounding on the
contracting base suggests hafting damage. This implement was probably
used to scrape soft materials (Fig. 26.6a). The second specimen does
not show evidence of edge attrition at the magnifications used in this
study (Fig. 26.6b). A large hinge terminated fracture on one lateral
margin may represent a failed attempt to mount the tool in a socket or
other haft.
Both examples were shaped by percussion and finished by
pressure flaking.
Form 3 (1 specimen)
A single subtriangular bifacial knife, (Fig. 26.6c), similar to
the Cleburne knives defined by Jelks (1962:44-45), was recovered from
Unit A, level 5. This specimen is badly broken but evidence of use,
most probably to scrape soft or medium soft materials, is present on
the lateral edges and tip. Significant edge rounding is present on
one lateral edge near the base and is suggestive of edge dul I ing
resulting from hafting. Chipping on this specimen is predominantly
the result of percussion flaking although pressure retouch occurs on
the lateral edges.
Form 4 (1 specimen)
One circular bifacial tool (Fig. 26.6d) was recovered from Unit
B, level 1.
This specimen was shaped by percussion flaking and the
edges retouched by pressure flaking. Attrition in the form of very
smal I step fractures and edge rounding, suggests use to cut soft to
soft medium materials.
Unclassified (13 specimens)
The broken tip of a large biface was excavated from level 2 of
Unit A (Fig. 26.6e).
The basal portion could not be reconstructed.
This specimen is particularly interesting since only one lateral edge

has retouch and subsequent attrition, while the opposite edge has
percussion flaking with only minor abrasion, suggesting that the
unretouched edge may have been protected from damage by a haft or hide
cushion. This implement was probably used to cut soft materials.
The fragmentary base of a convex base knife was recovered from
Unit
B,
level
4 (Fig. 26.6f).
The complete form cannot be
reconstructed but may be similar to the Covington knives from the Kyle
Site (Jelks 1962). This specimen was produced by percussion thinning
with retouch along the base and lateral edges. If the edge damage on
the lateral edges is attributed to use-wear and not to hafting, this
specimen was probably used to cut soft materials.
A smaller biface tip (Fig. 26.6g) was recovered from the same
provenience.
This specimen was shaped mostly by percussion, but has
retouch on both lateral edges. Type 2 attrition and abrasion on both
lateral edges indicate that it was probably used to cut soft medium
materials.
Three specimens appear to be basal or tip fragments, but are too
incomplete to be properly evaluated (Fig. 26.6h). Al I have secondary
retouch and two were probably used for cutting purposes, one on soft
materials and the other on soft medium materials. One specimen may be
an arrow point fragment; it does not show any evidence of attrition.
The remaining 7 specimens al I are bi face edge fragments and have
retouch and evidence of use for cutting (Fig. 26.6i). Two specimens
appear to have been used to cut soft materials, 3 were used to cut
soft medium materials, and 2 to cut hard medium materials.
Irregular (3 specimens)
Three of the specimens do not have a
recognizable
form
(Fig. 26.6j,k).
Two were produced entirely by percussion flaking and
appear to be unsuccessful attempts to bifacial ly reduce a chert cobble
to a usable form. One of them has a notch that appears to have been
used to scrape or prepare a leather or vegetal thong (Fig. 26.Sj). A
microscopic examination of the notch reveals not only wear but also an
accumulation of animal or vegetal material adhering to the surface.
Unfortunately, the necessary time and expertise to evaluate these
residues was not avai I able and must await further analysis. The third
specimen shows some retouch and evidence of use to cut soft materials.

Bifaces:

Discussion

The analysis of the bifaces supports the activities defined from
the analysis of modified debitage.
There is no evidence from the
analysis of the bifacial tools that would significantly modify the
activities suggested by the modified debitage. Bifaces appear to have
been used to work the same materials, except for hard materials, as
the modified debitage. Bifaces and modified debitage used to work the
same materials were always found together in the same provenience.
However, while bi faces and modified debitage are similar 1n
distribution and materials worked, they seem to have been used for
different purposes, probably because of the nature of their working
edges. The sinuous edge of a bifacial ly worked implement is best able
to withstand the lateral forces produced by cutting.
The unmodified
flake or chip edge is best suited to scraping, since attrition rapidly
produces the steep edge angle desired for this purpose.
The various
forms and attributes of the bifaces are suggestive of specialized
uses. The temporal placement of these forms and their association
with other tools and materials is not possible from the avai I able
evidence.
PROJECTILE POINTS (34 specimens)
Only 15 of the 34 projectile points and point fragments recovered
from the Bailey Site could be classified into defined types, largely
as a result of the fragmentary nature of most of the specimens (30
fragments, 4 complete points). The entire collection consists of 15
arrow points and fragments and 19 dart points and
fragments.
Two-thirds of the projectile points were recovered from Unit B, a
distribution that agrees with the general distribution of materials
from excavation units A and B.
Arrow Points (15 specimens)
Cliffton (3 specimens)
Three fragmentary Cliffton arrow points (Fig. 26.7a-c) were
recovered from levels 1 (2 specimens) and 2 (1 specimen) of Unit B.

Seal lorn (3 specimens)
Three Seal lorn arrow point fragments, 2 smal I basal fragments and
1 specimen missing the tip, were recovered from levels 1 (Fig. 26.7f)

coryel I variety (Jelks 1962:27-31), while the base from level 4 is
more I ikely the sattler variety (Jelks 1962:27-31).
Similar points,
from which these varieties were defined, were recovered by Jelks
(1962) from the Kyle Site.
Miscellaneous Arrow points and fragments (7 specimens)
Seven arrow point fragments (Fig. 26.7g,h), 3 from Unit A and 4
from Unit B, were too fragmentary to assign to a defined type. Most
specimens are blade fragments that could easily be from points of the
types identified above.
Arrow Points:

Discussion

The arrow points from the Bailey Site indicate the site was
occupied during both the Austin and Toyah phases of the Late
Prehistoric Period. While no Perdiz points were recovered during the
TAS or SMU investigations, Bryan (ms.) recorded examples from his
collections in the 1930s. In addition, he noted that ceramics were
present on the site, although none are in the TAS or SMU collections.
The absence of certain classes of artifacts, such as complete
Perdiz points, 1s not surpr1s1ng 1n I ight of the intensive surface
collection which the site has been subjected to for many years (Bryan
1931, ms.; Skinner et al. 1978:176; Watt 1953). However, the degree
to which recent collections can be biased is suggested by this
example.

fragmentary nature of both accounts for much of the uncertainty
(Fig. 26.7i,j). Both stems flare widely from the neck to sharp basal
corners.
One specimen, from level 1 of Unit A, has a straight base,
common on Ensor points, but is more finely finished than the usual
Ensor point.
The second, from level 1 of Unit B, has a concave base
more similar to the Edgewood points. Given the variation present in
the bases of these point types, however, these specimens could
probably be included in either.
Frio (1 specimen)
One fragmentary specimen (Fig. 26.7k), poorly thinned (10 mm
thick), is classed as a Frio point. The tip and one half of the stem
are missing, but the obvious basal notch and squared basal corner
identify this point as a Frio. It was recovered from level 4 of Unit
8.
Gary (2 specimens)
Two Gary dart points (Fig. 26.71,m), 1 complete and 1 missing one
shoulder, were recovered from Unit B, levels 2 and 3 respectively.
These points might be included in the Dawson type, as defined by
Duffield (1962:16-18) and modified by Prewitt (1974b:5-62), since both
show I ight stem edge and basal smoothing.
Pedernales (1 specimen)

classed as a Pedernales point (Fig. 26.7n). It was recovered from
level 3 of Unit B. The triangular blade, straight para I lel stem edges

This point is from level 1 of Unit A. In spite of its fragmentary
nature, it fits the type wel I, having a strongly expanding stem and
concave base.
Miscellaneous Dart points and Fragments (12 specimens)
Most of the specimens in this group could not be classified
because of their fragmentary nature. Two nearly complete specimens
were not classified because in one case the lower stem and base are
missing (Fig. 26.7p), and the other does not conform to any described
type (Fig. 26.7q).
The point missing the lower stem and base
probably is a Gary. The unclassifiable specimen lacks only the tip.
It has an elongate triangular blade and a poorly defined stem with a
convex base.
It 1s of fossi I iferous pinkish (heat treated?) gray
chert that does not appear to be derived from the local Uvalde
gravels.
The rema1n1ng specimens consist of non-diagnostic tip and
mid-section fragments.
Dart Points:

Discussion

The dart points suggest that the Bailey Site was not occupied
prior to the Middle Archaic Period. The specimens recorded by Bryan
(1931, ms.) further support this interpretation. The distribution of
the dart points indicates that the archeological strata are probably
mixed. The unequal distribution of debitage between the units is
para I leled by the distribution of the dart points, but to a lesser
extent, probably as a result of the smal I sample size.
PROJECTILE POINTS:

DISCUSSION

The projectile points recovered from the Bailey Site indicate
that this site is the result of multiple occupations extending over
approximately 3000 years and possibly as long as 5000 years. In I ight
of the smal I sample size, the variety of point types 1s most
interesting. This, coupled with the fact that several types are not
common
to this area, has some important imp I ications for the
occupation and exploitation of this area during the Prehistoric
Period.
Several
questions
concerning specific styles can be
addressed.
Jelks (1962:34-36), in defining the Granbury type, suggested that
it might represent a type of blank prepared prior to need and
A similar

26-28

BAILEY SITE
suggestion could be made for the Cliffton type. The association of
Cliffton and Perdiz points is very strong, one seldom occurring in a
site without the other.
The form and generally crude finishing of
Cliffton points suggests that they are blanks that would be wel I
suited to the manufacture of contracting stem arrow points such as
Perdiz. A comparison of the distribution and frequency of complete
and
fragmentary
Cliffton
points would provide an interesting
opportunity to evaluate this hypothesis.
Such a comparison would
probably reveal a high percentage of incomplete specimens with a
preponderance of basal fragments, not surpr1s1ng since the primary
diagnostic attribute of most projectile points is the basal portion
associated with hafting. However, in the case of the Cliffton type,
the frequent unifacial working and crude finishing of the blade,
together with the general size, might al low the recognition of
midsection and tip fragments as wel I.
Alternative hypotheses can also be offered concerning
the
classification of the Cliffton type. It was defined as an arrow point
(Krieger 1946:115-116) and is a demonstrably val id type.
Whether or
not it represents completed, functional arrow points, however, 1s
debatable. If Cliffton points were used as arrow points in an
essentially unmodified form, certain patterns of evidence can be
expected in the comparison proposed above. A preponderance of basal
elements, not as a result of archeological classification but because
the specimens were hafted, and when the point was broken in use, the
haft and the broken base were retrieved for reuse of the haft, would
be suggestive of use as completed arrow points.
In this case,
relatively few Cliffton midsections and tips are I ikely to be
recovered from the general refuse of the occupation.
If they
represent blanks, however, the same relative number of basal fragments
as midsections and tips would be expected.
The basal portion of the Cliffton point 1s not wel I suited to
hafting by binding with sinew or other fiber, given the generally
short narrow stem and wide shoulders. Such a base, however, might be
wel I adapted to an adhesive hafting, using bison hoof glue (Morf i
1935:67), asphaltum or other adhesive. The short tapered stem would
serve to prevent lateral movement by fitting into a notched arrow or
foreshaft, and the wide shoulders would provide a large surface area
for the application of adhesive. Microscopic and chemical examination
of specimens, particularly from dry environments, could be used to
evaluate this hypothesis.
The same procedure could be used to
determine whether the Granbury type served as a blank, as suggested by
Jelks (1962:34), or as a finished tool. The specimens from the Bailey
Site are too few and fragmentary to shed much I ight on these
hypotheses, but could provide supporting evidence for conclusions
reached from a larger regional sample.

26-29

BAILEY SITE
Flaked Stone:

Discussion

In general, the flaked stone technology at this site is much I ike
that at other sites in the area. Local materials were knapped in a
freehand fashion from multidirectional cores. Tools were finished by
both percussion and pressure flaking, the former being used primarily
to shape bifacial tools and the latter to sharpen and shape the tool
edges.
Platform preparation, as reflected on flakes and cores,
consisted primarily of perpendicular edge abrasion or edge crushing,
resulting in multiple facet platforms. Very I ittle edge grinding was
visible without magnification.
A cursory examination of
flake
platforms under low power magnification, however, indicates that
grinding, possibly associated with perpendicular edge abrasion, may be
more prevalent than is reported here.
Informal tools, consisting of unmodified or only
slightly
retouched flakes, were used for cutting and scraping. Formal tools
are restricted to projectile points (Cliffton, Granbur
Seal lorn),
gouges (Erath Bi faces), knives (Cleburne, Covington and a dri I I. The
analysis of edge damage on the informal tools and bifaces indicates
that a variety of cutting, scraping and boring activities were
performed on materials ranging in resistance from soft (possibly
animal flesh and hides) to hard (such as bone). The edge damage is
probably the result of manufacturing activities, including hide, wood,
and bone working, as wel I as food processing.
GROUND AND BATTERED STONE
Four stones with ground or battered surfaces were recovered from
the Bailey Site: 1 hammerstone, 1 chopper and 2 notched stones which
may be Waco Sinkers (Watt 1938). Al I were from Unit B.
Hammerstones (1 specimen)
A coarse grained quartzite hammerstone was recovered from level 1
of Unit B. This specimen has three areas of bruising, one on each end
and a third on an upper surface (Fig. 26.Sb, p. 26-23). Since it was
recovered from the upper 10 centimeters of the excavation unit, it 1s
possible that one or more of these areas of attrition was produced by
plowing implements.
Chopper or Crusher (1 specimen)
One specimen of fine grained Ogallala quartzite (Fig. 26.5c) has
three flaked and heavily battered surfaces. Similar specimens were
recovered from the McDonald Site and the Kyle Site (Jelks 1962:53-54).
These implements may have been used to crush animal bone for the

extraction of marrow or bone grease. The lack of preserved
materials at the Bailey Site leaves no supporting evidence.

faunal

Notched Stones (2 specimens)
Two flattened ovate quartzite cobbles (Fig. 26.Sd,e) from Unit B
have one or two notches in their edges. These specimens may be poorly
made or incomplete examples of Waco Sinkers (Watt 1938).
Ground and Battered Stone:

Discussion

The ground and battered stones from the Bailey Site support the
inferences concerning the activities reconstructed from the analysis
of the flaked stone materials.
The probable quartzite hammerstone
suggests hard hammer I ithic manufacture, while the chopper/crusher is
probably associated with hunting and animal processing activities.
There 1s no evidence from the ground and battered stone that seed
processing or grinding was practiced at this site, nor suggests it as
a function for the notched stones.
SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The depositional environment and post-depositional activities
affecting the Bailey Site have served to disrupt the integrity of the
archeological deposits and have
significantly
comp I icated
the
interpretation.
The distribution of temporally diagnostic artifacts,
as shown in Table 26.1, i I lustrates the degree to which
the
archeological materials have been mixed. As a result, it has been
necessary to treat the majority of the I ithic debris as a single
assemblage deposited over a very long period of time under a variety
of circumstances.
The

evidence

al low
a
differentiation within the assemblage on the basis of technological
characteristics. In general, the assemblage suggests a relatively
conservative tradition of flaked stone technology with only minor
changes through time.
The large burned sandstone feature is enigmatic, but is probably
the remains of a large disrupted hearth or hearths. Unfortunately,
the feature was never completely exposed and cannot be related to a
larger context. While it is not possible to firmly date this feature,
its depth below the surface and the relative frequency of diagnostic
specimens,
suggest
that
it 1s probably associated with Late
Prehistoric occupation(s).
The activities represented at this site, judging from the
analysis of patterns of attrition on I ithic debris, are most likely
related to food processing and manufacturing, which could easily be

BAILEY SITE
associated with any of a wide variety of site types. The definition
of site function has been the aim of much of the previous research in
this area (Lynott and Peter 1977;
Skinner and Henderson 1972;
Skinner et al. 1978, ms.).
This site has been interpreted as a
foraging camp by previous workers (Skinner et al. 1978:195; Lynott
and Peter 1977:100).
The
analysis
indicates
that
such
an
interpretation is too simplistic. when applied to this multicomponent
site. The Bailey Site appears to have been repeatedly occupied over a
very long time and probably served a variety of functions. The
principal value of this site I ies in its being representative of many
sites in this area.
The approach taken here is not entirely
satisfactory, since it has failed to differentiate between the various
occupational materials. A comparative analysis of occupational debris
from single component sites could provide a means of at least
evaluating the relative intensity of occupations in multiple component
sites and of documenting technological and adaptive changes through
time.

PILGRIM SITE - 41Hl124

Duane C. Peter

SITE DESCRIPTION
The Pi Igrim Site, 41HI124, is in the Eastern Cross Timbers biotic
zone on the southern extremity of the upland ridge that separates the
Aqui Ila and Hackberry drainages. The site, as presently recognized,
is situated both on the upland ridge and the upland slope adjacent to
Aqui Ila Creek (Fig. 27.1). The total site area is approximately 2500
square meters.
The peninsula-like projection of the upland ridge
slopes gradually from east to west, while the upland slope dips more
sharply toward Aqui I la Creek.
The alluvial bottomlands are very
narrow along this section of the Aquil la drainage.
Although the entire site has been cleared for pasture in the
recent past, the prehistoric environmental setting would likely have
consisted of grasses and overstory vegetation characteristic of the
Eastern Cross Timbers. Since the site area was most likely farmed in
the late nineteenth or early twentieth century and then al lowed to
remain
fallow, mesquite trees become the predominant overstory
vegetation. Some post oaks were present on the upland ridge prior to
the recent clearing activities. The entire site area has been disk
plowed at irregular intervals over the past ten years in an effort to
contain the brush and weeds. These cultural activities together with
natural erosion have destroyed the context of the assemblage on the
upland slope through the processes of slope wash and deflation. Such
forces have also affected the assemblages on the upland ridge;
however, the results have been significantly less destructive to the
archeological context.

SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS WORK
Since the recording of the Pilgrim Site in 1972 (Skinner and

affected researchers' perceptions of the extent of the site and,
As originally recorded, as sites x41HI75

and x41HI76, (Skinner and Henderson 1972) and tested (Lynott and Peter
1977), the site area was thought to be prima~i ly limited to the upland
slopes. Given the surface material visible in 1975 and the lack of
any vertical depth for the cultural deposits in the eight postholes
excavated, Lynott and Peter (1977) erroneously concluded that no
further work was warranted.
Later clearing and further testing in
1977 (Skinner et al. 1978) revealed that the major archeological
deposits at the Pilgrim Site were on the upland ridge itself.
27-2

PILGRIM SITE
Determination of the horizontal and vertical extent of these
buried deposits was accomplished through the excavation of ten
postholes and eleven 1 by 1 meter square test excavation units.
A
relatively extensive subsurface deposit (1050 square meters) was
revealed. Although these deposits were over 30 centimeters deep,
detailed mechanical and chemical analyses of the soi I sediments
(Pheasant 1978) supported the conclusion that portions might represent
in situ contexts. A varied collection of diagnostic elements from the
Nao-American and Archaic periods indicated that the site had been
utilized over a very long time span.
DATA COLLECTION
The 1978 investigations of the Pilgrim Site were designed to
further delineate the extent of the buried deposits, locate in situ
features, and investigate site function. Two 1 by 2 meter unitSplaced along the downslope edge of the ridge to determine the extent
of the buried deposits. The remaining excavation blocks (Fig. 27.1)
were placed 1n those areas indicated by the 1977 investigations
(Skinner et al. 1978) to have the greatest potential for .l!! situ
cultural deposits.

The minimal unit of horizontal control within the excavation
blocks was a 2 by 2 meter square. Vertical provenience was control led
through arbitrary 10 centimeter levels that fol lowed the contour of
the surface. The excavation of the upper two arbitrary levels removed
the disturbed plow zone and the uppermost stratigraphic unit, as
recognized by the sediment analyses of the 1977 investigations
(Pheasant 1978:234-236). The former surface within the profile, the
top of the 822 horizon, was then excavated within level 3. Due to the
significant reduction in the quantity of artifacts recovered from
level 3, most excavation units were terminated at 30 centimeters below
surface. Only units 23, 33, 35 and the northwest quad of Unit 21 were
excavated to a depth of 40 centimeters. In units 24, 30, 31, 36 and
37, dense concentrations of gravels caused excavations to
be
terminated at 20 centimeters below surface. All matrix was screened
through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. Surface materials were included 1n
the first level (0-10 cm) of each unit.

revealed that a former surface is represented at the top of Stratum 3.
Pheasant (1978:235-236) postulated that the surface may have been
exhumed prior to deposition or that the A horizon had been truncated.
Unfortunately, this profile has been greatly disturbed by agricultural
activities and the resulting deflation is especially evident in the
downslope units 24, 30, 31, 36 and 37.
Dense gravel deposits are
present within arbitrary level 2 (10-20 cm).
Even in the less disturbed areas, disk plowing and bioturbation
processes have affected the cultural stratigraphy of the site.
Diagnostic artifacts of the Historic, Neo-American and Archaic periods
are intermixed throughout the 30 centimeters of artifact-bearing
deposits (Table 27.1). Intact cultural features were also lacking
within the excavation blocks.
It is very likely that plowing has
severely altered the contextual integrity of much of the cultural
deposits.
Only level 3 (20-30 cm) I ikely escaped the effects of the
plow. Due to these problems, the horizontal and vertical patterning
of the artifacts must be interpreted with caution.

MATERIAL CULTURE
Lithic Debris
The total lithic assemblage recovered from the 1978 investigation
of the Pi Igrim Site consists of 10,413 specimens. The flaked stone
debitage constitutes 96.3% (n=l0,033) of this.
Nine specimens of
ground and battered stone were also recovered. Modified debitage
(n=241) is only 2.3% of the entire lithic assemblage.
Projectile
points (n=46), bifaces (n=83), unifaces (n=l), grinding stones (n=l)
and hammerstones (n=8) comprise the remainder.
Since the site deposits have been radically disturbed by
agricultural activities and soi I def lat ion, the cultural stratigraphy
has been largely destroyed.
Both the horizontal and
vertical
contextual
relationships of the artifacts have been negatively
affected. Due to the questionable contextual integrity of the lithic
assemblage, it wi II be discussed as a single unit. Horizontal
patterning wil I be examined on an inter-excavation block basis only.
Given the contextual situation, an examination of intra-block
patterning was judged to be unproductive.
To facilitate the analysis of the lithic assemblage from the
Pilgrim Site, the five blocks of contiguous excavation units will be
referred to as single units. The major excavation block, consisting
of units 21 through 29, wi I I be designated as Unit 1. To the
southwest, units 31, 32, 35 and 36 wil I comprise Unit 2. Unit 3, the
northernmost, wi I I consist of units 30, 33 and 34.
UNMODIFIED DEBITAGE
Flakes (4771 specimens)
PRIMARY FLAKES (207 specimens)
Primary flakes constitute 4.3% of the flake assemblage recovered
from the Pi Igrim Site. The highest proportions of primary flakes were
recovered from the major excavation units (Table 27.2). The downslope
portion was apparently not uti Ii zed for primary decortification.
Chert is the primary raw material (Table V.28). Quartzite (4.8%) and
quartz (0.5%) are the only other raw materials represented.
Contrary to many of the other assemblages, the primary flakes
exhibit a greater variety of platform types (Table V.29). Cortex
(49.8%) and single facet platforms (43.0%) are equally common.
Crushed and multiple facet platforms, although infrequent, also occur
within this assemblage. As might be expected, ventral platform lips
are also infrequent among the primary flakes. Only one specimen

27.2).
Unlike the primary flakes, they are evenly distributed
throughout the site. Although chert is the predominant raw material,
the remaining 3.4% are made of quartzite, chalcedony and quartz (Table
V.30). The chalcedony and quartz specimens were recovered from the
larger excavation units only.
Single facet platforms (59.5%) are more common 1n the secondary
flake sample than among the primary flakes. Cortex platforms (29.9%)
are less well represented. Crushed platforms appear on 8.0% of the
sample, while multiple facet platforms remain poorly represented
(Table V.31). The presence of ventral platform lips also remains
almost negligible (Table V.32). The lack of lipped platforms together
with the high proportion of crushed platforms may indicate that hard
hammer percussion was the primary means of secondary flake detachment.
Evidence of thermal alteration is present on only 5.2% of the
secondary flake assemblage.
TERTIARY FLAKES (2276 specimens)
Tertiary flakes occur almost as frequently as secondary flakes
within the site (Table 27.2). Chert (96.6%) is again the dominant raw
material with quartzite (2.5%) a distant second. Chalcedony, hematite
and quartz comprise the remaining 1% of the assemblage (Table V.33).
Only three platform types are represented in the tertiary flake
sample.
As with the other flake classes, single facet platforms are
most common with crushed platforms a distant second (Table V.34).
Multiple facet platforms comprise only 9.3% of the sample. Ventral
platform lips, although not overly abundant, are better represented
within the tertiary flake sample. Thermal alteration (6.7%) is also a
more common occurrence among the tertiary flakes.
FLAKES:

DISCUSSION

The distribution of primary, secondary and tertiary flakes among
the excavation units is remarkably consistent. Only Unit 37 failed to
yield any primary flakes. The dominance of the assemblage by primary
and secondary flakes (52.3%) suggests that the primary reduction of
lithic cobbles was the major
reduction
activity.
The
low
representation of multiple facet platforms together with the lack of
27-7

PILGRIM SITE
ventral platform lips also suggest that extensive bifacial thinning or
tool modification were not primary activities.
Chips (5178 specimens)
Chips constitute the most numerous category of lithic debris
recovered.
The distribution of the chips (Table 27.3) among the
excavation units closely para I lels that of the flake assemblage (Table
27.2).
The proportions of the raw materials of the chips, however,
differ from that of the flake assemblage. Chert (88.21) is sti II the
predominant
raw material, but quartzite (10.6%) is present 1n
significantly greater quantities. The fracture characteristics of the
less homogeneous quartzite may account for this larger percentage of
chips. Si I icif ied wood (0.1%) is also represented in the chip
assemblage, even though it was not present in the flake assemblage.
Chalcedony, hematite and quartz are only minimally represented (Table
27.3).

Thermal alteration is more evident within the chip assemblage

Cores (84 specimens)
Al I of the cores recovered are free hand percussion cores.
Al I
six core types are represented. Multidirectional cores (44~) are most
common,
while
bifacial
cores
(23.81) fol low in quantity.
Bidirectional, unidirectional and ninety degree cores ar equally
represented (Table V.35). Core fragments comprise only 2.4~ of this
sample.
Cores are primarily of chert (74.11) and quartzite (22.41)
with single specimens of both chalcedony and silicified wood (Table
V.36).
MULTIDIRECTIONAL CORES (37 specimens)
The multidirectional cores are made of chert (78%) or quartzite
Cortex (571) or single facet (43%) platforms are present on
all of the specimens. Battering is evident on only one. The size of
these cores (Table V.37) likely reflects the size of the locally
avai I able cobbles, for cortex is present on most specimens. The size
variability is great as indicated by the minimum (8.6 gm) and maximum
(475 gm) weight values. Although most specimens are not exhausted,
flakes of the desired size were perhaps no longer easily removed. The
local availability of cobbles did not make total exhaustion of a core
necessary.

(221).

BIDIRECTIONAL CORES (8 specimens)
Chert (631) and quartzite (371) cobbles served as the raw
materials for the bidirectional cores. The size is greater than that
of the multidirectional cores, but is less variable (Table V.38).
Either these cores were judged to be unsuitable for further reduction,
or raw material was so plentiful that ful I utilization of the cobbles
was unnecessary.
Cortex (63%) and single facet (251) platforms are
again the only evident forms of platform preparation.
The platform
type of one specimen is indeterminable. None of the bidirectional
cores exhibit battered facets.
UNIDIRECTIONAL CORES (9 specimens)
Sixty-seven percent of the unidirectional cores are of chert and
33% are of quartzite.
Platform preparation consists of unaltered
cortex platforms (671), single facet platforms (22~), and ninety
Battered facets are present on a single

specimen. The size of these cores largely reflects the size of the
locally available cobbles, for most of the cortical surface is stil I
present. Like the multidirectional cores, size variability is great
(Table V.39).

27-9

PILGRIM SITE
BIFACIAL CORES (20 specimens)
Bifacial cores are the second most common core type recovered
from the Pilgrim Site. Chert (80%) and quartzite (10%) are again the
primary raw materials.
Single specimens of si licified wood and
chalcedony are also present within the two major excavation blocks.
Single facet platforms (85%) are the most common form of platform
preparation.
Cortex platforms (10%) are only minimally represented.
The platform types are indeterminable on the remaining specimen. Only
two specimens exhibit battered facets.
The bifacial cores are the smallest of the entire sample of
cores.
The size variabi I ity is also significantly less than that of
the other core types (Table V.40).
Whether these cores
were
considered unsuitable for further reduction or they were too smal I for
the removal of additional flake blanks for tool production is unknown.
Both alternatives are equally I ikely.
NINETY DEGREE CORES (8 specimens)
This core type was recovered from the two largest excavation
blocks only. Al I but one of these specimens (88%) are made of chert.
The remaining specimen is of quartzite. Single facet platforms (63%)
appear on five of the specimens while cortex platforms occur on only
three. As with the other core types, battering is exhibited by a
single specimen only. Although the mean weight of the ninety degree
cores is nearly as smal I as that of the bifacial cores, the size
variabi I ity is significantly greater.
The size of some likely
reflects available cobble size rather than the exhaustion of the
cobbles (Table V.41).
CORE FRAGMENTS (2 specimens)
These are broken fragments of cores for which the flake removal
pattern and platform type are indeterminable. Both are of chert.
Neither specimen exhibits any battered facets.
The mean size 1s
smal I, as might be expected (Table V.42).
CORES:

DISCUSSION

The analysis of the cores from the Pi I grim Site indicates that
free hand percussion, with platform preparation I imited to either none
or single faceting was the primary means of initial reduction.
The
large number of cores indicates that tool production was a primary
activity at the site. The distribution of the cores (Table V.35) does
not indicate that such activities were limited to a particular area of
the site. Their distribution closely parallels that of the flake and
chip debris.

27-10

PILGRIM SITE
Although the forms of these cores are variable, multidirectional
and bifacial cores constitute the major portion of the assemblage.
With the exception of the bifacial cores, the size variability is
great.
Exhaustion of the core was evidently not the primary reason
for the discard of many of the specimens. Either such specimens were
considered unsuitable for further reduction or raw material was
abundant enough that a cobble was merely discarded after an immediate
need
for
flake
blanks was satisfied.
It is suspected that
conservation of lithic resources was not essential for the inhabitants
of the Aquil la drainage.
MODIFIED DEBITAGE/INFORMAL TOOLS
The 241 pieces of modified debitage from the Pilgrim Site
comprise 2.31 of the entire lithic assemblage. Chips were utilized as
the major source of blanks for these tools.
Secondary (32.41) and
tertiary flakes (22.41) follow in importance (Table V.43). A single
primary flake and a core were also used as informal tool blanks.
As
with the other assemblages from the Aqui I la drainage, Type 1 attrition
facets are the most common (Table V.44). Both types 1 and 2 attrition
facets appear on an additional 37.81 of these tools. Only 101 of
these specimens exhibit Type 2 attrition facets alone.
Battering,
alone or in association with Type 2 attrition, appears on the
remaining 1.61 of the modified debitage.
Type 1 Attrition (122 specimens, 136 facets)
Only 20 of these specimens exhibit more than a single facet. Two
facets appear on 18 specimens while three and four facets appear on a
single specimen, respectively.
Chips (39.3%) served as the primary source of blanks for these
tools.
Secondary (35.21) and tertiary flakes (25.41) follow closely
as preferred blank forms. Al I of these tools are of chert except for
5 specimens of chalcedony and 1 of quartzite. The representation of
chalcedony is particularly interesting since only 15 flakes of
chalcedony were recovered from the site.
The modification of al I the specimens exhibiting Type 1 attrition
1s unifacial in nature. The dorsal surface (72.11) of the blank is
the preferred position for this modification.
The ventral surface
(17.21) is also utilized. Some of the specimens exhibiting multiple
facets have been modified on both the ventral and dorsal surfaces
(7.41).
The position of the modification on the remainder of the
specimens is indeterminant (3.31).

PILGRIM SITE
A wide variety of locations were chosen for modification.
Lateral (52.5%) and distal edges (17.2%) or both on a single specimen
(4.9%) are the most common positions.
Locations related to the
proximal end of the specimen - oblique to platform, proximal, and
lateral+proximal - make up the remainder (2.4%) of the identifiable
locations.
Almost 25% of the locations of the Type 1 facets are
indeterminant (23.0%).
The
variety
of
locations of
these
modifications is matched by the variety of facet edge outlines.
Straight outlines (42.6%) are most common, but concave (18%), convex
(14.8%) and irregular edge outlines (14.8%) are also wel I represented.
The association of concave and convex shaped facets appears on yet
another 9 specimens. The remaining 3 specimens exhibit a notch or a
straight outline associated with a notch. Such a variety of facet
edge outlines suggests that extraction and maintenance activities at
the Pilgrim Site involved the cutting and scraping of a diverse group
of materials.
Type 2 Attrition (24 specimens, 27 facets)
Type 2 attrition appears primarily on chips (n=12) fol lowed by
secondary (n=6) and tertiary flakes (n=5) and a single primary flake.
Al I but one of these blanks is of the locally avai I able cherts.
The
single specimen is of chalcedony.
The modification is unifacial
(87.5%) except for 3 specimens that exhibit either bifacial (4.2%), or
both unifacial and bifacial (8.3%) facets. The location of these
facets is varied. The lateral edge (37.5%) is the preferred position.
The remainder of the identifiable locations (29.2%) are equally
divided among four locations:
distal edge, obi ique to platform,
lateral+distal and proximal.
The position and edge outlines of these few facets are as varied
as the larger sample of Type 1 facets. The dorsal surface of the
blank (54.2%) is the dominant position of this modification.
The
ventral surface (29.2%), and both the ventral and dorsal surfaces
(12.5%) are also common positions. The position of the modification
on one specimen could not be determined.
Irregular (29.2%) and
straight
(29.2%)
edge
outlines
dominate
these
locations.
Interestingly, notches (16.7%) are also wel I represented. Concave,
convex and concave-convex edge outlines are present in the remainder
of the sample.
Type 1 and 2 Attrition (91 specimens, 139 facets)
Forty of these specimens exhibit multiple facets with Type 1 and
Type 2 attrition.
Thirty-three have two facets, 6 exhibit three
facets, and 1 specimen has four.
Chips (50.6%), secondary flakes
(28.6%), tertiary flakes (19.8%) and a single core serve as the blanks
27-12

PILGRIM SITE
for these tools. Al I of these specimens, except 2 quartzite pieces,
are of locally available cherts. Modification is totally unifacial.
This large number of facets occurs in a variety of locations on
the blanks. Although the large number of chips renders this attribute
indeterminable in many cases (31.9%), the lateral edges remain the
preferred location (46.2%). Distal edges (7.7%) or a combination of
distal and lateral edges (7.7%) constitute the next largest portions
of this sample. The remaining 6.6% is divided among four locations:
obi ique to
platform,
lateral
projection,
proximal
and
lateral+proximal.
The position of modification is typically on the dorsal surface
(58.2%) of the blank. The ventral surface (20.9%) or a combination of
the ventral and dorsal surfaces (12.1%) fol low as preferred positions.
The position of the modification on the remaining 8.8% of the
specimens was indeterminable. The outlines of this modification are
even more varied than the positions. Of the eight outline classes
recognized, straight (29.7%) and concave (23.1%) are the most common.
Irregular outlines (15.4%) are also wel I represented. Convex (8.8%),
concave-convex (8.8%) and notch forms (7.7%) are less frequent.
Projection (2.2%) and a combination of straight and notch forms (4.4%)
comprise the remainder of the sample.
Battering (3 specimens, 3 facets)
Battering appears on 2 secondary flakes and a 1 chip.
The
secondary flakes are of quartzite, while the chip is of chert. The
modification of all three pieces is unifacial. Its location on the
chip is indeterminable. The modification appears on the proximal edge
of the secondary flakes. Its position on the dorsal surface of the
flakes raises questions of whether it represents previous attempts to
prepare a platform or actual use.
The convex outlines of the
modification on the flakes and the concave-convex outline on the chip
may have been the result of either process.
Type 2 + Battering (1 specimen, 2 facets)
A secondary chert flake served as the blank for this informal
tool.
Unifacial modification appears on the dorsal surface along the
lateral and distal edges. The edge outlines of both facets are convex
in form.
Since the position of this attrition is on the lateral and
distal edges of the flake, it I ikely resulted from use rather than any
attempt to prepare a platform.

PILGRIM SITE
Modified Debitage/Informal Tools:

Discussion

The distribution of these informal tools (Table V.44) closely
para I lels that of the flake debris (Table 27.2).
Although the
activities indicated by these tools were not I imited to a particular
area, the higher proportion of informal tools to flake debris in units
37 and 38 indicates that such activities were more important within
those areas. Extraction and/or maintenance activities not related to
I ithic reduction were apparently conducted in these areas more often
than those related to lithic tool production.
Chips and secondary flakes were the primary sources of blanks for
the informal tools (Table V.45). Intentional modification of these
blanks prior to their actual use is evident on only 48.2~.
This
modification is almost totally uni facial in nature (Table V.45) and
occurs most commonly on the dorsal surface of the blanks (Table V.46).
Unlike some of the other assemblages, such as the Brazi I Site,
the size of the blanks according to attrition type appears to vary
considerably. Al I three variables, flake length, width and thickness,
are significantly different when analyzed by attrition type. However,
this statistical significance is biased greatly by the few, large
pieces that exhibit battering (Table V.47). Removal of those pieces
leaves a very homogeneous set of flake blanks in regard to size.
The facet edge out I ines and their locations are highly variable
(Tables V.48, V.49).
Lateral and distal edges are the preferred
locations for the characteristic edge outlines -- straight, concave,
irregular and convex.
The overal I variability of the form and
location of the modification suggest that the extraction
and
maintenance activities conducted at the Pilgrim Site required informal
tools for a variety of cutting and scraping activities.
FORMAL TOOLS
Unifaces (1 specimen)
A single unifacial end scraper was recovered from the Pilgrim

This quartzite specimen was recovered from level 2 of Unit 31.
A secondary flake served as the blank for this formal tool.

position of the retouch is on the dorsal surface of the blank.
The
outlines of the lateral edges are straight and convex, respectively.
The distal edge is convex. The specimen is 49 mi I I imeters 1n length,
37 mi I limeters in width and 10 millimeters in thickness.

Bifaces (83 specimens)
Eighty-three bi faces and bi face fragments, excluding projectile
points, were recovered from the Pilgrim Site. Forty-one specimens
(49.4~) were recovered from Unit 1;
25 {30.1~) from Unit 2, 16
(18.1%) from Unit 3 and 2 {2.4%) from Unit 37 (Table 27.4). Ten
categories of bifacial tools were recognized on the basis of
morphology and technique of manufacture. One of these categories,
Form 13, was added to those categories previously defined in the
analytical section.
Without microscopic examination of the tool
edges, it is impossible to determine if all of these specimens
represent utilized tools.
Some of the bifacial forms, especially
those exhibiting little secondary retouch or pressure flaking, I ikely
represent products of the early stages of bifacial reduction that were
rejected as suitable blanks or preforms.
FORM 2 (1 specimen)
This single specimen from Unit 3 is a distal tip fragment of a
beveled biface. The alternate right edges of the fragment are steeply
beveled ()55 degrees). The remainder of each face has been percussion
flaked only. The two beveled edges are asymmetrical in outline; one
is convex in form, while the other is straight.
FORM 3 (2 specimens)
The two specimens are from Unit 1 (Table 27.4).
The single
complete specimen has been percussion flaked and exhibits pressure
flaking and use-wear along its edges. This specimen, with its convex
base and lateral edges, has been made from a flake blank. The
fragmentary specimen has been more finely pressure flaked.
The one
lateral edge of this specimen has been either ground or worn smooth
from use.
FORM 4 (1 specimen)
This circular specimen has been formed by percussion flaking.
The bifacial edge is sinuous and cortex remains on one of the faces.
The specimen is 35 mi I limeters in diameter and 14 millimeters thick.
Although use-wear is present, this specimen may represent the use of a
rejected blank rather than a purposefully formed bifacial tool.
FORM 6 (2 specimens)
These two fragmentary specimens exhibit convex bases and roughly
parallel lateral edges. Secondary retouch is present along the edges.
Although the distal half of each specimen is missing, it is presumed
that a bifacial form corresponding to the Covington knife, as defined

FORM 8 (15 specimens)
A wide range of variability 1.s exhibited by these thick
percussion flaked bifaces. The presence of secondary pressure retouch
varies significantly. Only a few specimens exhibit actual retouch,
use-wear is more commonly present. None represent finished bifaces,
rather they were likely rejected as unsuitable blanks for further
bifacial reduction and were picked up as needed for cutting and
scraping purposes.
Interestingly, most of these
bifaces
were
recovered from Unit 2 (Table 27.4). The differential distribution of
these bifaces suggests the presence of distinct activity areas within
the site.
FORM 9 (5 specimens)
These triangular to ovate biface fragments exhibit lenticular
cross sections.
Although some specimens exhibit pressure retouch,
shaping is crude.
Patterned attrition indicative of

infrequent.
The transverse breaks exhibited by these specimens
suggest that most are the product of errors made during the shaping of
artifact preforms.
Most of these specimens were recovered from Unit 1 (Table 27.4).
This spatial distribution is opposite that of the Form 8 specimens,
which are the logical prerequisite form for the production of Form 9
elements in a bifacial reduction sequence. The production or discard
areas of these stages of bifacial reduction were apparently distinct
at the Pi I grim Site.
FORM 5 (9 specimens)
These fragmentary specimens are very similar in form to the Form
9 specimens.
Peripheral pressure flaking and use-wear, however, are
common to al I. As with Form 9, the transverse breaks indicate errors
in the production of these preforms rather than breakage from use.
FORM 13 (9 specimens)
This category was added to characterize two specimens from level
2 of Unit 1 (Table 27.4). Although different in size, the two share
similar asymmetrical triangular shapes. Both exhibit convex bases and
one convex lateral edge. The larger specimen has one recurved lateral
edge while the fragmentary, smaller specimen exhibits a concave edge.

PILGRIM SITE
The smaller specimen has been shaped by fine pressure flaking.
The knapper was unable to remove a smal I knot from each face. A
similar problem also existed with one face of the larger specimen.
The larger specimen, although exhibiting pressure flaking, was not as
finely finished as the smaller specimen.
UNCLASSIFIED (41 specimens)
These 41 specimens are fragmentary sections of bifaces that
cannot be assigned to any of the defined categories. Only 4 are
fragments of finished bifaces. The remainder have been formed by
percussion flaking.
These specimens I ikely represent production
errors of the early stages of biface reduction. The large number of
such fragments is not unexpected given the larger number of cores and
the large proportion of primary flakes. The production of tools was
apparently a primary activity of the site occupants.
The high
frequencies (Table 27.4) of unclassified fragments throughout the site
attest to the importance of bifacial tool production.
BIFACES:

DISCUSSION

Al I but two of the bifacial tools from the Pilgrim Site were made
from the locally avai I able cherts.
A single Form 9 specimen from
level 3 of Unit 1 was made from quartzite, which is also present in
the local Uvalde gravels. The remaining artifact, a Form 8 specimen
from level 1 of Unit 2, was made from a fine grained flint with a waxy
luster.
This f I int is commonly found on sites to the northwest in
Eastland County. Although bifacial tool production was apparently an
important activity, the raw materials were not available at the site
itself. They were readily available, however, at the southern end of
the ridge overlooking the confluence of Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks
and on the upland slope and ridge across the creek from the site.
From the raw frequencies of the bifacial tools (Table 27.4) one
might assume that Unit 1 was the area of greatest activity for the use
and discard of such tools. Examination of the density values (Table
27.5), however, indicates otherwise.
Only in level 3, the least
disturbed level, is the density of bifacial artifacts greatest in Unit
1. Within level 2, bifacial tool densities are expectedly high within

Units 2 and 3 share the highest density values for bifacial tools
within level 1. The density value for level 1 of Unit 1 is extremely
low in comparison (Table 27.5). Given the downslope position of units

The specimen which

displays the most prominent serration also possesses laterally
protruding barbs. Although this trait is more characteristic of the
Alba point, the stem of this specimen is typical for the Perdiz point
style.
SCALLORN (12 specimens)
Like the Perdiz points, al I but two of these specimens are
fragmentary. Barbs or blade tips are most frequently missing. All of
these points are made of the locally available cherts. Al I have been
bifacially flaked, except for one specimen that has one surface flaked
along the edges only. Nine of the Seal lorn specimens were recovered
from Unit 1. Unit 2 yielded two specimens, the remaining specimen was
recovered from Unit 3.
Two stylistic groups are recognizable within this sample of
Seal lorn points.
The larger group (9 specimens) exhibits corner
notches with expanding stems that are much narrower than the shoulders
(Fig. 27.2a,c,d,f).
Stem bases are most often concave or convex.
Prominent, downward extending barbs are also characteristic of this
group.
Blade edges are variable with straight, convex, recurved and
slightly concave edges present. Two specimens also exhibit serration.
Such variability as exhibited by this group has been previously
designated as the "coryel I" variety of the Seal lorn point type (Jelks
1962:28-30).
The remaining three specimens correspond with the "sattler"
variety as defined by Jelks (1962:30).
These specimens exhibit
expanding stems that are nearly
as
wide as
the shoulders
(Fig. 27.2b,e).
These stems are formed by the presence of side
notches. Stem bases are straight to convex.
Two specimens exhibit
serrated blade edges.
ALBA (1 specimen)
This fragmentary specimen exhibits the concave blade edges and
wide outf laring shoulders characteristic of the Alba type, as defined
by Suhm and Jelks (1962:263-264). The remaining portion of the stem
exhibits parallel edges.
UNIDENTIFIABLE FRAGMENTS (5 specimens)
Five distal fragments, one medial section, a possible Perdiz stem
and
three possible Seal lorn fragments have been designated as
unidentifiable. The possible Scallorn fragments either have a large
portion of the stem missing or the stem had broken and had been
reworked. All but one of the unidentifiable fragments were recovered
from Unit 1. The remaining specimen was recovered from Unit 2.

PILGRIM SITE
BULVERDE (1 specimen)
This specimen exhibits the characteristic wedge shape stem of the
Bulverde point.
The rectangular stem has straight edges and an
irregularly shaped base. The blade has been extensively reworked or
resharpened.
The alternate beveling of the right edges gives the
blade a twisted profile.
The shoulders are prominent with short
barbs.
This specimen, which is diagnostic of the Middle Archaic
Period, was appropriately recovered from level 3 of Unit 2.
GARY (2 specimens)
These fragmentary specimens exhibit contracting stems. Shoulders
are very prominent and barbed. The triangular blades have concave or
convex edges. One specimen is made of chert, the other of quartzite.
YARBROUGH (2 specimens)
These two specimens exhibit weak to prominent shoulders without
barbs.
The stems are slightly expanding with convex bases. This
projectile point style was common during both the Late Archaic and
Late Prehistoric periods in East Texas (Suhm and Jelks 1962:261).
KENT (1 specimen)
This specimen exhibits a narrow rectangular stem with a convex
base. The triangular blade has a twisted profile in cross section due
to the beveling of the alternate right edges.
The shoulders are
almost right angular with an absence of barbs. This specimen was
I ikely discarded during a Late Archaic occupation.
ELLIS (2 specimens)
These fragmented specimens exhibit expanding stems formed by
broad corner notches.
The stem base is usually straight. The
shoulders are prominent with downward extending barbs. The blade of
one specimen is triangular with a recurved and a convex edge
(Fig. 27.2j). Like most of the dart points recovered from the Pilgrim
Site, these specimens probably reflect a Late Archaic occupation.
PALMILLAS (1 specimen)
This stem fragment exhibits the characteristic bulbous stem of
the Palmi I las type (Suhm and Jelks 1962:229). The shoulders of this
specimen are moderate.

All of the stem edges are very wel I ground. This fragment corresponds

UNIDENTIFIABLE DART POINTS (8 specimens)
Five of these specimens are dart point forms that are not
consistent with the presently defined projectile point types. The
remaining three are too fragmentary for identification. Four of these
unidentifiable specimens were recovered from Unit 1 and three others
from Unit 2. The remaining specimen was collected from the surface.
Three of the dart points share a common form.

specimens would fit wel I within the Godley type, as defined by Jelks
(1962:40-41).
The two remaining specimens are distinctive.
One exhibits a
narrow triangular blade with slight beveling of the alternate right
edges (Fig. 27.2i). The stem is formed by asymmetrical side notches.
The base of the stem is the original platform of the flake blank used
for the manufacture of this tool.
The other specimen exhibits an
asymmetrical blade with strong barbed shoulders (Fig. 27.2j). The
stem is rectangular with straight edges and a straight base.
One
surface of the stem has been basally thinned.
Like the other
specimens within this category, assignment to a particular point type
is not possible. It is apparent, however, that al I of these forms are
consistent with the variability expected of a Late Archaic assemblage.
PROJECTILE POINTS:

DISCUSSION

The projectile points recovered from the Pilgrim Site indicate
that the site was uti Ii zed primarily during the Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric periods. The Austin phase of the Late Prehistoric was
apparently the most intensive period for use. Unfortunately, these
occupations are not stratigraphically separate. There also seems to
be I ittle horizontal separation of the components.

Interestingly, al I of the hammerstones were recovered from the

these areas, rather their limited presence is only detectable through
the recovery of larger samples. Hammerstones were probably curated
for long periods of time. If such an assumption is correct, their

SITE SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Excavation of the Pilgrim Site (41HI124) during 1978 revealed a
shallow occupational deposit.
Sixty-nine percent of the cultural
artifacts were recovered from the upper 20 centimeters of the deposit,
corresponding to the modern plow zone.
The presence of historic
artifacts in level 3 (20-30 cm bs) indicates that modern cultural and
natural processes have radically transformed the context of the
prehistoric artifacts. Both the vertical and horizontal contextual
relationships of the artifacts have been destroyed.

Unfortunately, this

Site.

Whatever the period of occupation, core reduction and tool
production were apparently primary activities. A debitage/core ratio
of 118.44, the high proportion of cores (0.8%), and the relatively
high proportion of primary and secondary flakes (52.3%) al I indicate
that primary lithic reduction was a predominant activity.
The large
proportion of unfinished bifaces recovered from throughout the site
also indicates that the reduction process was continued through the
bifacial shaping of tools. There is no way of determining if these
activities were more important during certain periods of occupation.
The tool diversity of the Pi I grim Site is the greatest of any of
the sites investigated during the 1978 season. Modified debitage,
projectile points, bi faces, uni faces, ground stone and hammerstones
are al I represented.
The modified debitage or informal tools also
exhibit a wide variety of cutting and scraping edges. A wide range of
subsistence activities was apparently conducted at the Pilgrim Site.
Whether this range of activities reflects repeated short term
utilization or extended use as a base camp is difficult to judge given
the disturbed nature of the site. The lack of features and a faunal
assemblage are likely due to modern disturbances rather than their
lack in the systemic context. However, the use of the site over a
probable 3000 year time span suggests that most occupations were
likely of short duration and periodic in frequency. The Pilgrim Site
probably functioned as a generalized foraging camp for the inhabitants
of the Aqui Ila drainage.

CHAPTER 28
UPLAND SITES - SUMMARY
David 0. Brown

Five prehistoric sites have been discussed in the preceding
section.
Although portions of most of these sites extend off of the
upland down onto terrace and floodplain areas, the greater part, or at
least the most extensively investigated portion, I ies on the upland.
Generally classed as upland, each site actually occupies a slightly
different
geomorphic
setting.
By
the
same token, cultural
manifestations are also slightly different at each.
The Bailey Site (41HI77) occurs on an isolated remnant of T2
terrace along the western margin of the Aqui I la Creek valley.
Topographically the terrace remnant, that slopes slightly toward
Aqui I la Creek, is located on a broad, stubby finger ridge which
projects outward into the valley and has been cut away by the creek at
its easternmost margin, where a steep bluff has formed. The terrace
fi 11 in this area is shallowly underlain by Woodbine sandstone, which,
as Patton notes (Chapter 3), probably reflects the depth of alluvial
f i I I at the valley margin. Above the site and to the west I ies a
higher upland flat, strewn with Uvalde gravels.
The Pilgrim Site (41HI124), which also lies on the T2 terrace, is
markedly different from the Bailey Site.
It 1s located on the
westernmost corner of a large lobe of T2 terrace, projecting southward
from an even larger terrace segment that divides Hackberry and Aqui I la
creeks. Uni ike the Bailey Site, which slopes slightly toward the
creek, the Pi I grim Site I ies on a broad, relatively flat area. Also
uni ike the Bailey Site, the fi I I of the terrace is quite deep.
Observations in adjacent borrow pits for dam fi I 1 1 showed the terrace
f i I I to extend at least as far as the surface of the floodplain, and
perhaps deeper (ca. 6 m).
Although each of the hi I I side group of sites (41HI109, 41HI110
and 41HI111) is slightly different, al I share a number of common
characteristics. Al I three I ie along the valley margin of the eastern

UPLAND SITE SUMMARY
edge of the Aqui I la/Hackberry creek valley.
Al I extend from the
purely col luvial Eagle Ford, down hi I I sides onto the floodplain and
al I I ie below the extensive Uvalde gravel hi I I top recorded as 41HI165,
a large lithic procurement and primary reduction workshop.
The
relationship of these four sites is shown in Figure 28.1.
The northernmost of these sites, 41HI109, is located primarily on
a large col luvial fan near the foot of the slope. The central site,
41HI110, covers a more extensive portion of the upland, extending down
the hi I !sides onto at least one apparent bench (i.e., an erosional
terrace remnant that may coincide with the major portion of the T2
terrace) and one or more smal I col luvial fans at the foot of the
hi I I slope.
The southernmost site, 41HI111, stretches from
the
dissected uplands south of the smal I tributary drainage that separates
this site from 41HI110, down across a broad expanse of col luvial fan
that may over I ie the T2 terrace in places near its edge. It continues
along the T2 terrace, sloping down across a possible segment of Tl
terrace onto the floodplain. This site has the most extensive known
floodplain component of al I the upland sites.
Above the three sites I ies 41HI165, formerly numbered x41HI78 by
SMU.
An examination of the original field notes indicates that this
site was originally recorded in 1975 by Mark Lynott and is not the
same site as the one described as x41HI78 in the 1972 archeological
survey report (Skinner and Henderson 1972). The site was revisited 1n
1980 and 1982 by the TAS archeological crew, and was re-recorded 1n
January of 1983 as 41HI165 by the TAS Management Data Survey crew.
Site 41HI165 is on the western edge of the rol I ing uplands in
Eagle Ford Lake Waco Formation sediments. Most of the site is located
on Chatt clay, but Lamar clay loam, Birome-Rayex complex and Normangee
clay loam are also mapped along the westernmost edge (Brooks 1978).
The site is large, occupying most of the hi I !top, but only its extreme
westernmost edge is on Corps of Engineers property. During most of
the visits by TAS archeologists, the site was a plowed and unplanted
field, offering excel lent visibility of cultural materials.
The site is a large I ithic procurement and primary I ithic
reduction workshop located in a high Uvalde gravel deposit. Cultural
material included tested cobbles, cores at various
stages
of
reduction, and flakes and chips of al I sizes. Raw materials available
at the site include both chert and quartzite.
No diagnostics were
observed but a local collector maintained that the site was a
productive one for broken projectile points, perhaps
specimens
abandoned during manufacture.

UPLAND SITE SUMMARY

No cultural material was col lected 1 but a sample of raw materials
was taken from three different site areas for comparison to cultural
materials and raw material samples from other sites in the project
area.
These samples were taken from a circle with a radius of 1.13
meters and an area of 4 meters.
Al I rocks larger than four
centimeters in any one direction were collected and bagged. For
comparison, rock samples were collected from a field northeast of
41HI165 on the Fred Davis farm, an area that may have been used
prehistorically but apparently less so than 41HI165, and from 41HI153,
a prehistoric Uvalde gravel procurement area on the east side of
Aqui I la Creek, northeast of 41HI74/114. The fol lowing table (Table
28.1) shows the number of specimens collected, the total weight, the
average weight of each specimen and the percentage of chert present.
As can be seen in this table, the average weight varies only
minimally, although the average Aqui I la Creek gravels may be slightly
heavier. Total number is variable, with the sparsely uti I ized Davis
farm area showing a uniformly larger number of specimens available.
It is not possible to clearly state whether or not these differences
in material density are due to erosional 1 depositional or cultural
factors, or some combination of the three. Since most of the material
1n al I of the samples is quartzite, it is possible to rule out
cultural depletion as who I ly responsible, as quartzite
is
so
infrequently used for tool production throughout the lake area.
Percentages of chert are much lower in most of the 41HI165 samples,
however, and it is suggested that this may be due to resource
depletion. Differences in cobble size and chert percentage between
Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks may reflect depositional differences
among the original Uvalde gravel deposits.
The upland portions of sites 41HI109 1 41HI110 and 41HI111 are
described in their respective chapters as primarily I ithic workshop
areas. This is most apparent in the number of bifaces, particularly
thick bifaces, found at these sites. At 41HI109 and 41HI110, bifaces
other than projectile points comprise larger percentages of the lithic
assemblage than at any other Aqui I la site (data on percentages of
I ithic artifacts is tabulated in the concluding chapters of this
report). 41HI111 is excluded from al I of the quantitative discussions
because its collected sample is smal I and biased toward formal tools
and larger debitage.
Nonetheless, it is I ikely that its upland
portion is primarily a I ithic workshop. Th-addition, 41Hlll0 has the
second highest percentage of cores found at any site in the Aqui I la
area.
At least partially because of the presence of a quantity of
abandoned tool blanks (and at both of these sites some of the stemmed
artifacts identified as projectile points may have been abandoned

during manufacture), these two sites are among the lowest in the lake
area in percent debitage. At 41HI109, debitage (flakes, chips and
cores) comprises 93.4~ of the total lithic sample, while at nearby
41HI110 debitage accounts for 94.9~. Somewhat surprisingly, the only
two excavated sites with lower percentages of debitage are the Reps
Davis Site (41HI58) and the Sul I ivan Site,k41HI117), neither of which
is thought to be exclusively a I ithic workshop area. In both of these
cases, it appears as if a combination of high numbers of unfinished
blanks (these two sites have the third and fourth highest percentage
of bi faces in the lake area) and uti I ized flakes, lower
the
percentages of debitage.

28-5

UPLAND SITE SUMMARY
While both the Bailey Site and the Pi I grim Site are obviously
workshops as wel I, the abandonment of blanks is not so clearly
recorded. The Bailey Site has the lowest percentage of bi faces from
any site in the lake area, while the Pi I grim site has a percentage
considerably lower than at either 41HI109 or 41HI110.
Additionally,
both
have
high percentages of total debitage.
With debitage
comprising 97.3% of the total I ithic sample, the Bailey Site is the
highest in the lake area. The Pilgrim Site, with 96.3% debitage, is
third highest, after 41HI76. Both the Bailey and Pi I grim sites also
have slightly higher percentages of modified debitage than 41HI109 and
41HI110.
I ithic

Several other differences distinguish these two groups of sites.
Both the Bailey and Pilgrim sites fal I within the Eastern Cross
Timbers biotic zone, while the hi I I side sites fal I along the edge of
the Blackland Prairie.
This mapped difference may be deceptive,
however, since the hi I I side sites, underlain by Eagle Ford sediments,
nevertheless are today (prior to clearing) covered by the post oak and
juniper assemblage that characterizes much of the modern Cross Timbers
area.
Para I le ling this biotic difference are geologic and hydro logic
differences.
The Bailey and Pi I grim sites, though partly alluvial,
are underlain by Woodbine sandstone and drained by the sandy-bottomed
Aqui I la Creek.
The hi I I side sites are on Eagle Ford Group sediments
and drained by the clay-rich Hackberry Creek. In addition, the former
group of sites are adjacent or close to Aqui I la Creek while the
hi I I side sites are from 100 to 200 meters east of Hackberry Creek.
One of the most important differences of al I may be cultural.
While al I four sites are multicomponent, with evidence of several
thousand years of intermittent occupations, both the Bailey and
Pilgrim
sites show evidence of a significant Late Prehistoric
component. In both cases, this component appears to be primarily
I inked to the earlier Austin phase, although both have some trace of
Toyah phase occupation. The hi I I side s-r'tes do not show clear evidence
of a significant Late Prehistoric component. The most extensive Late
Prehistoric component at either of these sites is from the floodplain
portion
of
41HI111, which is not considered in the artifact
discussions because of the smal I sample size. The emphasis on flake
blanks for arrow point manufacture may partially account for the
quantities of debitage, but this does not appear to be in complete
agreement with the moderately high number of bifaces found at Late
Prehistoric sites such as McDonald (41HI105) and Reps Davis (41HI58).
The data are far from clear, but perhaps biface production and
uti I ization were less important during the earlier Austin phase,
strongly represented at Pilgrim and Bailey, than in the Toyah phase,
represented by most of the artifacts from McDonald.
28-6

UPLAND SITE SUMMARY
A comparative study of I ithic assemblages from the Central Brazos
region complied by Skinner et al.
(ms.) does not support this.
Excluding debitage other than cores; bifaces and knives comprise a
slightly greater portion of the Austin phase tool assemblage at 13.3%
as compared to 11.6% for the Toyah phase. On the other hand, the same
study shows the decrease in biface production from the Late Archaic to
the Late Prehistoric. Based on a sample of 20 Late Archaic sites, the
percentage of bifaces found 1s 22.4, almost twice that for the
combined Late Prehistoric.
In any case, the Bailey and Pi I grim sites contain the most
extensive Austin phase occupations in the lake area. Unfortunately,
both sites were the loci of numerous intermittent Archaic occupations
as wel I, and at neither is it possible to elicit any stratigraphic or
areal separation between the various components.
The
Archaic
occupations at the Bailey Site barely outnumber the Late Prehistoric
occupations, if raw counts of projectile points can be taken as a
val id indicator (19 dart points to 15 arrow points). The span of time
represented by those Archaic dart points is broad, resembling the long
occupation histories reflected in the projectile point assemblages
from the two southernmost sites, 41HI110 and 41HI111. No one period
of time appears to be over emphasized.
At the Pi I grim Site, on the other hand, the projectile points
seem to be almost uniquely datable to the later part of the Archaic.
The two specimens that may not fit within this late time period are
the Bulverde specimen, which could not be relocated for examination,
and the stem fragment identified as a Dari point (p. 27.23).
This
latter specimen, with its heavily ground edges, could possibly be an
example of what Prewitt (1981) has termed the Hoxie point.
Also
referable primarily to the Late Archaic is the projectile point
assemblage from 41HI109, with evidence of Late Prehistoric occupation

diagnostics from this latter site is smal I and may be subject to
sampling error.
While it is not surpr1s1ng to find that the upland areas of
Aqui I la Lake were uti I ized throughout the Prehistoric, and that most
of these stabi I ized land surface areas show mixed, multicomponent
occupations, it is possible that certain functional consistencies
occurred among this group of sites throughout the period. Of course,
both the random nature of activities performed at short term camps and
the changing patterns of resource exploitation through time, as well
as the m1x1ng of activities from different encampments, would have
obscured a great deal of important evidence for functional patterning.
In addition, the lack of preservation at upland sites in the Aqui I la
Lake area makes functional interpretations difficult.

28-7

UPLAND SITE SUMMARY
Thus I imited to stone tools and their residue in
mixed,
multicomponent sites, a functional analysis can hardly be more than
superficial. Nonetheless, their specific locations are felt to be
important.
Al I of these sites, as wel I as several other upland sites
in the project area, represent a dense concentration of I ithic debris
with diagnostic indicators from a number of temporal periods. If
these remains are the result of a large number of
ephemeral
occupations, then it is clear from a map of the recorded sites that
they are not randomly scattered across the landscape but concentrated
in several areas along the upland margins.
This is, of course,
comp I icated by the fact that the reservoir I imits did not go much
beyond the upland edges in many places.
One identifiable resource that may have governed the location of
these sites is I ithic raw materials in the form of Uvalde gravels
along the valley margins.
Such gravels are present 1n
large
quantities on the crest of the hi I I above the hi I Iside sites and the
uti I ization of these resources seems to be indicated in the high
percentages of cores and bifaces from these sites. The northernmost,
41HI109, has the highest percentage of bifaces found at any site 1n
the lake area and the middle site, 41HI110, the second highest. This
latter site also has the second highest percentage of cores.
Lithic resources do not seem to be critical locational factors at
either the Pi Igrim or Bailey sites, although the latter is located
near several large outcrops on the hi I Is above and to the north and
south.
Lower terrace gravels are avai Iable along the hi I Isides below
the Pi I grim Site, although not in the quantity of any of the maJor
Uvalde gravel outcrops, and the raw material size may be somewhat
smaller. The Pi Igrim Site has a respectably high percentage of cores,
but neither site contains a particularly high number of bifaces. In
fact, the Bailey Site has the lowest number of bi faces and the second
lowest number of cores of any major site in the lake area.
Without a detailed examination of upland sites farther upstream
along major lateral drainages and those sites at some distance from
major watercourses, it is difficult to assess the overal I functional
role of upland sites in the region. Whether upland edge sites such as
those investigated at Aqui I la are more I ike other pure upland sites or
more like bottomland sites is impossible to ascertain. The most
striking and obvious differences are geomorphic, but the cultural
significance of these differences remains somewhat speculative.
In one of the concluding chapters of this report, the food
resources of the Aqui I la Lake area are discussed in more detai I.
Although no fauna! or floral remains were recovered from any of the
upland sites, portions of the paleoenvironment can be reconstructed
with some confidence. Some potentially avai Iable upland resources are

discussed in more detai I in that chapter. It can be stated here that,
with the exception of the Pi Igrim Site whose original vegetation
assemblage is problematical, al I of the upland sites are now in or
adjacent to oak forest and it is I ikely that the inhabitants of these
sites made use of these rich protein sources each fal I. In addition,
deer feeding on the acorn mast at this time of year would have
provided an equally important food source.
In summary, although al I of these sites are classed here as
upland
sites
and
share minimal geomorphic similarities, the
differences among them are greater than their similarities. Each site
is unique, although certain similarities suggest a grouping that fal Is

procurement and primary reduction workshop, 41HI165, shows almost no
similarities to the other sites and may have served no function other
than those stated.
Al I of the upland sites show some evidence of lithic tool
manufacture, perhaps as much or more so than at any of the bottomland
sites. However, other evidence, in the form of features and wel I
uti I ized tools, strongly suggests that this was not their only
function. The lack of faunal remains from such sites is a definite
handicap, but one that is not I ikely to be overcome except under the
most unusual geomorphic circumstances. Future attempts to understand
the functional significance of upland sites wil I necessitate not only
the careful examination of use-wear patterns, but the isolation of
temporally discrete components.
