Archeological Investigations at the Dalbey Site
(41DL350), Dallas, Texas
S. Alan Skinner, C. Britt Bousman, and Jesse Todd

ABSTRACT
The Dalbey site (41DL350) is a prehistoric archeological site exposed in the west bank of the Trinity River
in Dallas, Texas. The 6+ m thick floodplain deposit contains four buried paleosols and burned clay surfaces.
Previously a human burial was found eroding out of the base of the bank near the south end of the site and
was radiocarbon-dated to cal A.D. 970-1040. Trenching and testing were carried out by AR Consultants in
2003 and 2005 at the north end of the site prior to construction of the Loop 12 Boat Ramp. A geoarcheological
profile in the middle of the site was recorded in order to define the geological context of the site and compare
the north and the south portions. Trenching the riverbank along the ramp centerline confirmed the presence of
burned clay surfaces reported by Tim Dalbey, who called the site to the attention of the Texas Historical Commission. Testing of 7 m3 of sediment from between 4-6 m below the surface failed to define living surfaces
adjacent to hearth stains. The small artifact assemblage recovered included lithic debris, fire-cracked rock, bone
fragments, mussel and snail shells, and a single Gary dart point. Radiocarbon dating documented occupation
from cal. A.D. 460 to A.D. 1340 with underlying sediments dating older than cal. 135 B.C. The site represents
repeated occupation during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods for the purpose of acquiring riverine
and floodplain foods.

INTRODUCTION
The site (Figure 1) was first discovered in 1993
during an AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) survey of
the proposed Little Lemmon Lake Park (Skinner
and Whorton 1993) and is recorded as 41DL350.
The site deposit is exposed in the west bank of the
Trinity River channel and extends downstream
from the Loop 12 bridge. Since 1993, the site has
been visited several times in conjunction with
future projects (Kahl n.d.). In 2001 and 2002,
the site was evaluated by Tim Dalbey (2003) in
anticipation of plans for the construction of a concrete parking lot and boat ramp just downstream
from the Loop 12 bridge. It was Dalbey’s goal to
convince planners of the site’s significance so they
would avoid and preserve it. Because of Dalbey’s
interest in the site and the unexpected discovery of
a human burial downstream from the proposed boat
ramp location, the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) and the City of Dallas agreed to have the
immediate area of the proposed boat ramp tested
to determine if significant cultural resources were
present and would be endangered by the proposed

construction. In recognition of Dalbey’s concern
for and attention to the site, it has been designated
the Dalbey site.
Surface soils at the Dalbey site, in the center of
the Trinity River floodplain, are mapped as Trinity
clay, formed on alluvium (Coffee et al. 1980:6768). Dalbey (2003) documented the alluvial sediments at the site as a 5-6 m deep deposit exposed
in the right river bank. These consisted of an upper
1.5 m thick layer of sandy loam that rested above
a buried paleosol (Dalbey 2003:Figure 2). The
surface of a second paleosol was recorded at 3 m
bs. Parts of a disarticulated buffalo were found at
the base of and in the second paleosol. The second
paleosol is marked by thin layers of charcoal,
burned clay lenses, and accumulations of freshwater mussel shell along with scattered deer bones
eroding out of the bank. Dalbey recovered a bison
skull below the second paleosol and documented
a third paleosol at approximately 4.75 m bs. The
bison bones were noted when the site was first recorded but the river was at a higher level and the
presence of the lower artifact-bearing sediments
was not recognized (Skinner and Whorton 1993).

A partial human burial was recovered by the Dallas
Police Department approximately 5.5 m below the
floodplain surface and on or in a fourth possible
paleosol. Charcoal from a pit located 72 cm above
the skeleton and 25 cm below Paleosol 3 was radiocarbon dated to 610 ± 70 B.P. [2 sigma calibrated
age range of A.D. 1270-1430] (Beta-161636). This
date appeared too recent in age so subsequently, a
200 g human rib bone sample was processed and
yielded a date of 1020 ± 40 B.P. [2 sigma calibrated
age range of A.D. 970-1040] (Beta-164235).
Between 2001 and 2003, Tim Dalbey monitored the site and in anticipation of the proposed
boat ramp he submitted a letter report to the City
of Dallas describing his observations about the site
(Dalbey 2003). He recommended “excavating the
part of the site that is exposed on the lower bank
bench, and work back (west) into the bank according to the slope of the ramp and other boat ramp
impacts.” Based on the stratigraphic order of the
dates and the position of the human skeleton, it appeared that the skeleton had been found in place. At
the north end of the site (Dalbey’s Location #13),

three features were described in the area of the boat
ramp. The first (Feature B) was an oval organicstain defined by a slight oval surface rise that was
about 100 cm (north-south) x 70 cm (east-west).
Charcoal and gastropods were associated with the
feature. The second feature (Feature C) was larger
in area (183 cm north-south x 125 cm east-west)
and contained charcoal, burned clay, fire-cracked
rock, mussel and snail shells, and animal bone in
a gray matrix. The third feature (D) was a circular
red-stained area that was protruding above the
adjacent eroded surface and contained charcoal
and mussel shells. Similar features were exposed
downstream in the scoured river bank and displaced artifacts were present on the surface of the
bench level along the river at low flow.
At the beginning of the present investigation
(see also Skinner et al. 2005), the Dalbey site was
considered an example of a briefly but repeatedly
occupied prehistoric campsite that was located on
an overbank flood levee along the Trinity River
channel. Based on Dalbey’s dates and surface
artifacts, it was anticipated that the site had been

Skinner et al.—Archeological Investigations at the Dalbey Site (41DL350), Dallas, Texas
occupied for less than a thousand years before the
present for the primary purpose of harvesting locally available riverine food resources, and hunting
and gathering animals and plants. It appeared that
the occupied levee banks had flooded regularly and
that artifacts and burned surfaces were sealed in
place by thin silt layers.
METHODOLOGY
The primary purpose of this investigation was to
document the stratigraphy, identify and evaluate the
stratigraphic context of features and artifacts, and
obtain radiocarbon dates to define the chronological extent of the prehistoric occupations. It seemed
likely that the floodplain surface had been disturbed
prior to and during construction of the nearby fourlane Loop 12 bridge. However, the presence of an in
situ buried deposit had not been investigated when
the bridge was constructed and probably would not
have been done in conjunction with boat ramp construction had Dalbey not voiced his concern about
the site. The area to be affected by construction of
the boat ramp (Figure 2) was roughly 130 m eastwest and extending west from the river’s edge and
was a maximum of 30 m north-south. Much of this
area was a parking lot but the remaining area is a 23
m wide and 45 m long boat ramp.
Excavation began in 2003 by first clearing
vegetation from the edge and slope of the river
bank (Figure 3). Subsequently, a trackhoe was
used to excavate trenches (Figure 4). Trenching
revealed loose trash-filled matrix over the surface
and edge of the floodplain that required stepping
the riverbank trench so that it would be possible to
place test units at any prehistoric features exposed
in the trench. After digging two trenches it was
apparent that there was nowhere else to excavate
trenches within the affected area that had archeological potential. Six 1 x 1 m units were positioned
to investigate burned clay features and to secure an
artifact sample. Fill from the six excavation units
was dry-screened through 1/4-inch mesh hardware
cloth. We found no evidence of human burials or
other features. We also had advised the City of
Dallas and the contractor that we had encountered
a perched water table that resulted in slumping
walls. Without THC authorization the boat ramp
contractor then began earthwork to create the
boat ramp cut. This excavation was ceased at the
request of the THC, which determined that further

63

archeological investigations were warranted under
the terms of the Antiquities Permit.
An additional six 1 x 1 m units were approved
by the THC and funded by the City of Dallas. We
planned to begin excavation in March 2004 but at
that time and for the subsequent year and a half the
Trinity repeatedly flooded and inundated the site.
It was not until the end of June 2005 that the river
level reached a point when the site was exposed
long enough to allow excavations to proceed. We
planned to water screen in the field but this would
have slowed excavation, and without clean water,
water screening was impractical and uneconomical.
The day excavation concluded, the site was once
again flooded. In order to expedite excavation, it
was decided to shovel scrape each 10 cm level and
place the matrix into 4 mil plastic bags for immediate removal and subsequent water screening. This
resulted in the collection of nine tons of moist clay
matrix that had to be screened elsewhere. Water
screening was done using 1/8-inch mesh screens.
The matrix from each bag was emptied into a plastic bucket that was then filled with water containing
two cups of baking soda to serve as a deflocculant
to break down the clays. The bucket was stirred
and allowed to percolate before the sediment/water
mixture was placed on the screen for washing.
GEOARCHEOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS
The geological profile (ARC Profile 1 on
Figure 5) was located in the center of the site for
the purpose of relating the boat ramp testing to
Dalbey’s (2003) stratigraphic description further
downstream. Our profile description is presented
in Table 1. A nearby rock-filled basin was recorded
and a radiocarbon sample collected from it. Three
buried organic-stained A horizons are described as
Zones 5, 7, and 9. It is most likely that the prominent soil described in Zone 5 would be termed
the West Fork Paleosol by Ferring (1990:56-57).
Sediments exposed in the 2003/2005 excavations
are below Zone 9 and represent a very heavily
weathered matrix. Weathering likely occurred due
to the regular and repeated inundation by the river.
Matrix in the Test Units (TU) 6-12 described below is similar to that where the burial was found
and similar to Zone 9. Radiocarbon dates from the
geoarcheological Profile 1, the excavations, and
Dalbey’s samples are presented in Table 2.

Of particular interest is the rock-filled hearth
that appeared to be in Zone 7. Limestone rocks
up to 6 cm in diameter filled the hearth basin,
marked by burned clay and containing small pieces

of charcoal. The hearth was 48 cm long and no
more than 10 cm deep in cross-section. The pit
bottom was not visible, and the hearth was not
excavated. Charred wood from the hearth matrix

was collected, submitted for AMS-radiocarbon
dating and resulted in an conventional age estimate
of 1170 ± 40 B.P. (see Table 2). A single piece of
quartzite was recorded at the edge of the hearth in
the cut bank. No evidence of a burned clay surface
was noted in the riverbank flanking the hearth

and the radiocarbon sample was the only material
collected. This conventional age is clearly not in
agreement with Beta-208105, also in Zone 7 (see
Table 2). In addition, Dalbey (2003) reports two
conventional radiocarbon assays measured on
charcoal from a feature and on human bone from

Skinner et al.—Archeological Investigations at the Dalbey Site (41DL350), Dallas, Texas
a burial more than 50 m downstream from Profile
1. These are 1020 ± 40 B.P. (Beta-164235) and 610
± 70 B.P. (Beta-161636). We could not record their
exact location in relation to Profile 1, but Dalbey
(2003) suggested that these two dates come from
an inset fill that appeared to sit unconformably on
alluvial sediments vertically below Zone 9. If this
is correct, then the radiocarbon assays support Dalbey’s model of deposition. However, the sediments

and their depths at Dalbey’s investigations were not
described in detail during the current geoarcheological efforts and direct proof was not collected.
The radiocarbon assays from 41DL350 were
calibrated with OxCal (Bronk Ramsey 2013) to
further investigate the apparent dilemma caused by
the inverse ages between Beta-208105 and Beta208106 in Zones 7 and 9. Figure 6 and Table 3
present the resulting age distributions with the ages

70

arranged stratigraphically from top to bottom, with
the upper two samples representing the assays from
the inset fill identified by Dalbey (2003).
The results of the calibration plots and materials dated can be used to suggest that sample
Beta-208105 is not an accurate age estimate. This
assay measured bulk sediments from the buried
soil that comprises Zone 7. The most reasonable
explanation for the anomaly is that this sample was
contaminated by older carbon. If this interpretation is correct then this would imply that there is
very little difference in age between Zones 5 and
7. Also, this indicates that the burial documented
by Dalbey is significantly younger that the Zone
5 sediments.
If we inspect the charcoal dates that were
measured in relation to the elevation datum, and
constrain the calibrations by depth, these suggest
that rapid sedimentation occurred in the excavation
area. The OxCal plot of calibrated modeled age and
depth using a 2 sigma error envelope illustrates the
age/depth model (Figure 7). This set of radiocarbon
dates span approximately 115 years when 140 cm
of sediment accumulated. This equates to 1.217
cm/yr. If we fit a linear regression to calculate an
age/depth model using the mean modeled ages in
Table 3 (Age AD = -0.8393  depth+1071.3), the
coefficient of determination is extremely high,
R2=0.9993. These data can be used to suggest that
this was a function of repeated low energy overbank flooding that did not significantly disturb the

archeological materials and the upper portion of
this sequence appears to have accumulated at the
same rate as the lower portion. This model can be
used to suggest that the burial documented by Dalbey and the other associated radiocarbon sample
(Beta-164235) may be significantly younger than
the excavated sediments in TU 2-11 and Dalbey’s
interpretation that the burial was placed in an infilled cut is probably correct.
SITE TESTING
When the site was first visited, a silt fence
near the edge of the channel spanned the width of
the study area but the fence had been silted in and
then run over in various places. Trash in the form
of auto parts, concrete chunks, and plastic bags
was found to be imbedded in the upper part of the
riverbank, but the lower part of the slope appeared
undisturbed and resembled the site area down
river where bison bones and a human burial had
been found below Dalbey’s second paleosol and
where there appeared to be an undisturbed deposit
extending from the floodplain surface down to the
river level.
Due to the depth of the deposit, it was necessary to use a trackhoe rather than a backhoe to
explore the floodplain sediments to the full thickness of the site deposit and to search for features.
Two trenches were excavated and then TU 1-6

were excavated. Trench 1 was set back from the
river bank in the western part of the boat ramp
area where the ramp is now situated at a relatively
shallow depth below the present ground surface.
The trench was 7 m long and 1.35 m wide. It was
excavated to a maximum depth of 2.38 m, which is
lower than the expected depth of the ramp excavation. The south wall of the trench was scraped and a
profile drawn. Excavation revealed that the matrix
exposed in both sides of the trench was recent fill
and contained layers of plastic and other historic
trash to the depth of a dipping silty clay and sand
layer that is present at 111 cm bs near the west end
and 213 cm bs at the east end of the trench. Below
that were laminae of sand and silty clay that did
not contain historic artifacts but were obviously
recently deposited, possibly in conjunction with
construction of the Loop 12 bridge. No evidence
of undisturbed sediments was found in Trench 1,
nor were prehistoric artifacts recovered or features observed. Consequently, there was no reason
to further excavate in this part of the floodplain
deposits as we had dug deeper than the area of
potential effects of the parking lot. This is unfortunate because we do not know if buried cultural
materials are present away from the edge of the
channel. However, the reported but unconfirmed
presence of 41DL78 near the south end of Little
Lemmon Lake in a similar setting may be a hint
that buried sites are present in settings away from
the river bank. Furthermore, floodplain surveys
and test excavations upstream in the vicinity of the
Central Wastewater Treatment Plant (Skinner et al.
1991; Skinner and Whorton 1993; Buysee 2000)
and within the Dallas Floodway (Cliff et al. 1998,
1999; Frederick et al. 2006) have located sites
exposed in the floodplain, but none has a profile
such as that described for the Dalbey site. We do
not know where the river bank was at the time of
occupation, although a sterile zone at 41DL318
separated the two components and may indicate
that the river was close at hand.
Trench 2 was excavated in the cut bank by first
placing the trackhoe at the edge of the bank and
scraping the slope. This revealed that the upper 2
m of the floodplain matrix contained historic fill
like that encountered in Trench 1. Apparently the
floodplain sediments in this area were removed
and then refilled with new sediment and trash.
This is not the case in other parts of the site downstream. The upper 2 m of fill were then removed
and a surface for the trackhoe constructed so that

it could reach to the bench at the river’s edge. By
creating the surface, it was possible to excavate
the trench to approximately the river level and
then move the dirt to the floodplain where it could
be inspected. This excavation revealed that there
was a narrow zone of undisturbed clay loam that
extended upslope to a height of approximately
2 m above the elevation of the bench. Several
apparently burned clay surfaces were exposed
in the trench wall and are discussed below. The
upper portion of the original river bank had been
removed west of the river bank and this created a
depression that had subsequently been filled with
a sandy loam and clay loam matrix. The filled
depression was not recognized before trench excavation and it formed a perched surface on which
water seeped on the floor of Trench 2 and continually flowed to the area of the test units.
Excavation of Trench 2 revealed that the only
area in the boat ramp that contained an undisturbed
geologic deposit was approximately 5 m wide.
The stepping needed to make the trench walls safe
from fill slumping was further aggravated by water
seepage and required that the full width of the area
of potential effects be excavated (see Figure 2).
Therefore, there were no other locations to place
the originally planned third and fourth trenches.
Furthermore, emphasis had been placed on excavating undisturbed deposits near the base of the
slope where Dalbey had previously observed claylined hearths and noted buried artifacts that were
eroding out of undisturbed sediments.
Test Units (TU) 1-6 were excavated in undisturbed sediments near the base of the slope slightly
above the elevation of the human burial reported
by Dalbey; this elevation was reported to have
been 5.58 m below the floodplain surface (Dalbey
2003) near the south end of the site, but we could
not plot its exact location or elevation. TU 1 and
TU 2 were placed at the eastern edge of Trench 2
in the vicinity of an apparent burned surface. TU
4 was excavated into the bank adjacent to TU 1
and TU 2. TU 3 was located to explore below the
bench surface and TU 5 and TU 6 were excavated
to explore apparent burned surfaces exposed in the
walls of Trench 2. Artifacts from these six units
are itemized in Table 4. Charcoal, ash, and firereddened clay were found dispersed throughout
TU 1 and TU 2 and were concentrated within the
4.3-4.4 m below datum (bd) zone that appeared
to be a surface on which burning had occurred.
It was impossible to define the limits of burning

within the test unit. The surface did not present
a resistant and slightly elevated appearance such
as those described by Dalbey because it had not
been scoured by river flooding but rather had been
covered by sediment. Burned shell fragments and
bone along with fire-cracked rock and a piece of
burned sandstone were present. No chipped stone
or ground stone tools were recovered from TU l.
A decomposed three-tined deer antler was found
in the west wall of TU 1 and extended into TU 2
and TU 4. The antler was complete but showed no
evidence of having been modified. It appeared to
be lying on the buried ground surface at the elevation of 4.3 m bd. The two units, TU 1 and 2, were
excavated to 40 cm below the level of the antler
and the burned surface but no additional features
were encountered. A total of 1.8 m3 of in situ sediment from TU 1, 2, and 4 was excavated. An AMS
conventional date on charcoal from level 4.30-4.40
m bd in TU 2 was A.D. 650-775 (see Table 3).

TU 3 was placed on the level bench away
from the river bank. This half unit was extended
to a depth of 30 cm below the bench surface. No
cultural materials were recovered from this small
unit. An adjacent 4 inch diameter auger hole was
excavated to a depth of 170 cm below the bench
surface where water was reached. TU 5 and TU 6
(Figure 8) were excavated where burned areas were
exposed in the walls of Trench 2. A possible hearth
was uncovered in TU 5 at approximately 4.48 m
bd but the lateral extent of the feature was not definable within the unit and no evidence was found
below it. The possible hearth consisted of burned
clay with inclusions of charcoal. Mussels, animal
bones, and gastropod shells were recovered from
the same level. A burned clay surface was found
in TU 6 at a depth of 4.66-4.76 m bd that extended
into the south wall of the unit. The projected radius of the exposed hearth was approximately 55
cm and it was approximately 6 cm thick. Only the

northeast quarter of the feature was uncovered due
to the compact moist overburden that would have
to have been removed manually. A concentration
of shell was uncovered in the center of the clay
surface and a bone and flake were also recovered.
Charcoal was collected from the same level but just
outside it and the AMS date was A.D. 545-660 (see
Table 3). This was the deepest feature excavated
in 2003. As elsewhere, snail and mussel shell fragments, bone fragments, three pieces of lithic debris,
and two pieces of fire-cracked rock were recovered
from the unit in the two excavated levels. Excavation was discontinued due to the low artifact yield,
lack of features, as well as the absence of plant
remains from meaningful contexts.
A total of 10 pieces of lithic debris was collected from TU 1, 2, 5, and 6; TU 3 and 4 contained
no lithic debris. TU 1 contained a quartzite interior (i.e., non-cortical) and a secondary flake (i.e.,
with some cortex on its outer surface), a quartzite
interior chip (a chip, as the term is used here, is a
flake that is missing its platform or is otherwise the
distal part of a flake) and a small piece of quartzite
shatter. A single quartzite interior flake was recovered from TU 2. TU 5 had two quartzite chips, one
being an interior and the other being a secondary
chip. Three pieces of lithic debris were recovered
from TU 6. Two of these pieces were chert, one an
interior flake and the other an interior chip. The
third piece was a primary (i.e., its outer surface is
completely covered with cortex) quartzite shatter.
TU 2 contained eight of the 10 pieces of firecracked rock recovered in the excavations. Seven
pieces of limestone and one piece of quartzite were
also recovered. One additional piece of fire-cracked
rock from TU 2 at a depth of 4.30-4.40 m bd had
evidence of possible grinding on the surface. One
piece of fire-cracked rock was collected from TU
6 between 4.66-4.76 m bd.
Most of the faunal materials consisted of small
fragments measuring from 4-19 mm in maximum
length. The total number of bones examined was
152, of which 44 were unidentifiable. Eighty six
of the bones were from a fragmented deer antler.
Other species represented include Eastern Cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), Eastern Box Turtle
(Terrapine carolina), turtle (Testudinata), and fish
(Teleost sp.). Based on the faunal evidence, the
inhabitants of this site were consuming deer and
various smaller mammals, turtles, and fish.
The gastropod (snail) fauna is indicative of
constant perennial vegetation that consisted of

woods, downed logs, as well as leaf and forest
debris. The bivalve (mussel) fauna indicate a
medium to large-sized stream where the water
was of low to medium quality. The stream has a
mud substrate based upon the abundance of Plectomerus dombeyanus.
At the conclusion of the 2003 investigation,
it was apparent that a vertically stratified deposit
remained preserved near the base of the slope just
above where the boat ramp was to be extended into
the river. This is illustrated as Figure 9, a schematic
cross-section that corresponds to the centerline of
the boat ramp and extends from the present floodplain surface down to the river level. As shown in
the profile, sandy fill mixed with post-World War
II trash extends from the present floodplain surface
down to the now truncated floodplain sediments.
Trench 2 cut into the original floodplain matrix as
had all six TUs and Auger Holes 1 and 2. Based on
the two calibrated radiocarbon dates, it appeared
that occupation in TU 2 occurred between A.D.
650-775 and that the burned surface in TU 6 dated
slightly earlier at A.D. 545-660 (see Table 3).
Occupation of the Dalbey site along the
river bank was apparently regularly repeated but
short-lived based on the numerous ephemeral
and apparently burned clay surfaces and the limited artifact assemblage recovered. The faunal
remains indicate food acquisition and immediate
consumption. The two radiocarbon dates indicate
occupation at the end of the Late Archaic. Unfortunately, the limited artifact assemblage recovered
did not contain any projectile points, ceramics,
or other artifacts with which to evaluate the adequacy of the radiocarbon dates.
Excavation ceased in 2003 due to a variety
of factors but primarily because units had been
excavated to the proposed boat ramp level and no
burials, distinct stratigraphy or features, and few
artifacts had been found. Soon after archeological excavation ceased, the contractor cleared the
floodplain surface for the parking lot and dug the
ramp area by expanding the stepped cut created
by Trench 2. The ramp excavation uncovered additional trash and concrete fill in the upper 2 m and
encountered the perched water table. This work
was ultimately halted by the THC. The contractor
then backfilled the ramp cut to avoid erosion in
anticipation of further archeological investigations.
An additional scope of work was prepared by
ARC and ultimately approved by the THC and
the City of Dallas. When the work began again in

July 2005, despite a year and a half of flooding, the
mapping reference point had remained in place on
the bench. This allowed us to relate the 2003 TU
to the 2005 excavation units as shown in Figure 8.
It had been planned to excavate a 2 x 3 m block
that was situated on the bench at the bottom of the
slope and adjacent to the river. Unfortunately the
river edge eroded away part of the level bench and

repeated drainage from upslope continued to soak
the southwest corner of the block. Consequently,
the location of that unit was moved to the northwest
corner of the grid (Figure 10). This extended the
investigation of the river bank deposit more than
1 m below the bottom of TU 6, which is above the
normal low water level. Excavation proceeded by
excavating all six units in the block to 10 cm below

10 cm levels to 100 cm. One unit (TU 11)
was continued to 120 cm below datum.
Because soil was shovel scraped and
then bagged and removed for subsequent
fine screening, our in-field impression was
that artifact densities were low and varied
little per level, except that it was apparent
that a distinct occupation surface occurred
between 5.70-5.80 m bd in each of the six
units. The scraped surfaces were regularly
inspected for features or obvious artifact
concentrations but none were found. Despite
generally clear, hot, and humid weather, the
block was inundated twice; once due to an
upstream water release and the second time
due to an intense localized rainstorm. Within
an hour after finishing excavation, the block
was inundated completely as the result of
several hours of intense rain.
As shown in Figure 11, only a single
zone containing artifacts was encountered.
The matrix in the entire block was described
by Bousman as an olive brown (2.5Y4/4)
clay loam with fine moderate to strong
angular blocky structure, and common
bluish-gray (10B5/1) gleyed redox features
(mottles). The lower boundary of this heavily weathered matrix was not observed.

5.60-5.70 m bd level in TU 8 and the calibrated age
range is 430-650 A.D. (Beta-207123). The deepest
sample was from level 5.70-5.80 m bd in TU9 and
it yielded a calibrated age range of 545-660 A.D.
(Beta-207124).
These dates provide a simple sequence that
can be modeled in OxCal using the sequence
function so that the ages are constrained by the
stratigraphic position of the samples (Figure 12).
The estimated start-date for this series is A.D. 568
± 56 and the end-date is A.D. 652 ± 55. All four
dates are from tight contexts and demonstrate that
the sedimentation rate averaged 0.4 cm per year
during this time interval.
Both pieces of lithic debris from the 2005 work
are chert. One is a secondary flake from 5.70-5.80
m bd in TU 8 and the other is a piece of shatter
from TU 7. The Gary dart point (Figure 13) is complete and was resharpened along all edges except
one of the two shoulders where fine retouch from
the original knapping is still preserved. Resharpening exposed the grainy quartzite under the slightly
patinated surface. The point weighs 4.5 grams and

measures 36.4 x 19.0 x 7.9 mm in length, width,
and thickness.
An unthinned biface, probably a rejected
piece, and a bifacial mano of sandstone were
found eroding out of the bank downstream from
the excavation block. The mano weighs 388 grams
and measures 126.0 x 91.6 x 24.6 mm in length,
width, and thickness. The biface is fine-grained
quartzite and is roughly triangular in shape. It
was thinned by percussion and shows no evidence of secondary retouch. It weighs 6.0 g and
measures 30.3 x 21.6 x 9.6 mm in length, width,
and thickness.
Plectomerus dombeyanus, which prefers a
mud substrate, is quite prominent in the upper
levels but almost absent in the lower levels of the
TU, whereas Tritogonia verrucosa, which prefers
moderate to high quality water, is present in the
lower levels. The mollusks demonstrate that the
Trinity River substrate in the vicinity of 41DL350
has become muddier and decreased in quality
over time, and the water was cleaner in the lower
levels. The river environment changed minimally,

possibly due to the shifting of gravel bars, because
Quadrula nodulata was found only in the 5.70-5.80
m bd level in TU 8.
The sediments found in the 2003/2005 excavations are below Zone 9 and represent a very heavily
weathered matrix. Weathering is likely to have occurred due to regular inundation by the river. The
matrix in the block excavation appears to be similar
to that where Dalbey described the burial.
It appears that the floodplain habitat that included permanent vegetation, trees, downed limbs,
and leaf and forest debris along the Trinity River
adjacent to 41DL350 did not vary over time from
the lower portion of the deposits to the present
day. The river’s substrate may have changed as
well as the quality of the water and the influx of
clay slightly at various times from the lowest level
to the present day. Possibly three stable surfaces
are present, two in the upper portion and one in
the lower portion of the excavated part of the site.
Prehistoric burned clay surfaces are visible in the
river bank and may mark areas that were used to
steam the mussels in the past. Severe burning of
the shell may have resulted from either accidental
or intentional inclusion in fires.
In summary, testing in the boat ramp project
area revealed that the upper sediments are no longer present. It appears that a slightly more intense
prehistoric occupation was present in the zone
investigated in 2003 than in the deeper 2005 block
excavation. Nevertheless, the natural environment

81

based on sediment deposition rates, faunal and
charcoal remains, and the few artifacts and occupation surfaces found appear to have been roughly
unchanged over time and floodplain adaptations
remained constant. Occupation in the boat ramp
area spanned the period from approximately A.D.
570 to A.D. 650. Based on the testing results, it is
predicted that sediments containing scattered cultural materials may continue below the water line.
The radiocarbon dates present an interesting
set of questions with regard to the placement of the
burial in the geologic context of the Dalbey site.
The burial appears to have been in or on the same
matrix uncovered in the 2005 block and it was at approximately the same elevation as the bench surface
adjacent to the block. Consequently, it is logical to
expect that the date of the rock-filled hearth, which
is more than 1 m above the adjacent bench surface,
would be younger than A.D. 930, the burial date,
and possibly younger than the higher pit date of
A.D. 1340. Likewise, if the burial date is associated with the matrix that is lower than Zone 9 (see
Table 1), it is also logical to expect that the block
sediments might date in the A.D. 900s. However, the
four calibrated dates from the block range A.D. 570650. Therefore, it is possible that the burial is out
of primary context, although the sediments do not
support this conclusion, or that the human remains
were placed in a cut-and-fill deposit.
CONCLUSIONS
The Dalbey site is a deeply stratified Late
Archaic to Late Prehistoric site that exhibits
stratigraphic elements more refined than Ferring’s
general Trinity River sequence. Based on his
recalibration, the elevation of the West Fork
Paleosol appears to match Lawrence’s (2010:187189) Synchronous Event IV. These multiple
stacked fining upward deposits from the proposed
level of the boat ramp cut upward are capped
by a paleosol and the site represents a preferred
campsite location. Similar sites have been recorded
upstream but do not present the same deeply
stacked occupation sequence nor have they been as
well dated despite the more extensive vertical and
horizontal testing that has been done.
Trackhoe trenching in the boat ramp project
area discovered that the upper 2-3 m of the
floodplain sequence had been removed and then

white layer in the right cut is road rock that is in the mixed overburden attributed to bridge construction and which
extends to the depth that corresponds to the top of the trackhoe motor.

the stratigraphy at the south end of the site and
Profile 1 in the center of the site demonstrates
that evidence of prehistoric occupation begins
about 1 m below the present ground surface and
extends to the river level and possibly below.
The river may have been near at hand during the
sequence of deposition that was preserved above
low river flow but the presence of mussel shells,
gastropods, and flood sediments does not indicate
where the river channel was throughout that time.
An unknown amount of the site was eroded by
Trinity River flooding and during the course of this
investigation more than 0.5 m of the low bench
eroded away and new artifacts were repeatedly
deflated onto the slope of the bench or exposed in
the freshly scoured river bank. Excavation below
the base level of the boat ramp hints at the presence
of further buried deposits but exploration of these
deposits was outside the scope of this investigation
and as shown by testing, the recognition of living

surfaces or artifact associations is likely to be
difficult whenever the site is revisited.
Occupation must have been on a seasonal
basis due to regular inundation that would have
prohibited year round occupation or even permanent
seasonal occupation. The small faunal assemblage
does not pinpoint a season of occupation, but Martin
(1995:244-245) believes that the Trinity River floodplain was generally occupied during the summer and
fall when nuts and various animals would have been
available to be harvested. Todd (2000:93) concurs
with the results of the Joe Pool Lake study and the
faunal remains from the Dalbey site fit his expectations for a site of this type during this time period.
The site is certainly not a “shell lens” site although
shell fragments were found scattered throughout the
matrix along with animal bone and an occasional
stone artifact. If a larger bone sample had been
recovered from an extensive block excavation or
if nut shells or tubers had been recovered, it might

Skinner et al.—Archeological Investigations at the Dalbey Site (41DL350), Dallas, Texas
have been possible to more adequately determine
the season or seasons when the site was occupied.
By nature of the site setting, it is possible that there
never was sufficient intensity or duration of occupation to have deposited and preserved seasonally
sensitive plant or animal remains. This situation
is similar to hearth-centered artifact distributions
described by Binford (1978) where the stay was not
long enough for the accumulation of maintenance
debris to have become a nuisance. This contrasts
with the living surface described at the Aiken site
at Lake Granbury (Skinner 1971:208-227), but it is
possible that distinct surfaces may be present at the
Dalbey site and await discovery.
The artifact sample from the Dalbey site
is similar to those assemblages recovered from
41DL318 and other sites in the Central Waste Water
Treatment Plant area just upstream (Buysee 2000).
Lithic artifacts in the form of lithic debris and an
occasional projectile point were found at 41DL318
and 41DL319/357 but none were found in trenches
and test pits at 41DL337, 41DL338, 41DL355, and
41DL356. Four sites had discarded animal bone and
mussel shell fragments in a density similar to the
Dalbey site. It is apparent that chipped stone tool
manufacture and maintenance were not common
activities at the site as has also been shown to be the
case in the tested sites just upstream. The paucity
of chipped stone tools may be an indication that
hunting was not a prominent activity at the site even
though animal bones were present. The chipped
stone and faunal assemblages from the Dalbey
site are similar to that from the Rough Green site
(41TR162) (Skinner et al. 1999) on the West Fork
of the Trinity River except that hearth rock and mussel shells were more readily available on the West
Fork where the floodplain is narrower and where
sandstone is exposed in the valley walls. The Rough
Green site has tentatively been interpreted as a bur
oak collecting site. At the Dalbey site, occupation
must have been brief as it was impossible to define
a living floor within a 1 x 1 m unit although burned
clay was found in the units and burned clay features
were exposed in the river bank.
The Dalbey site is an unusual find in the Trinity
River basin, particularly in Dallas County. Prehistoric sites have been found in floodplain, terrace, and
upland settings but virtually none of the known sites
have revealed deep vertically stratified deposits.
Extensive testing in the Trinity River floodplain in
downtown Dallas, the Elm Fork below Lake Lewisville (Anthony and Brown 1994; Largent et al. 2004;

83

Prikryl 1990), and in the West Fork watershed by
Geo-Marine, AR Consultants, and others has not exposed a similar site deposit. Testing and excavation
as part of the Lake Ray Roberts studies in the Elm
Fork watershed north of Denton (Skinner and Baird
1985; Prikryl and Yates 1987; Ferring and Yates
1997) found several vertically stratified sites as well
as a deeply buried occupation zone at the Aubrey
Clovis site (Ferring 2001). Although apparently occupied between A.D. 570-1350, occupation surfaces
at the Dalbey site are ephemeral and must indicate
brief occupation by small family groups between
repeated flooding episodes. Artifact assemblages
are restricted to almost nothing but faunal remains.
At that, an average of only 136 artifacts was found
in each cubic meter excavated in the archeological
deposits. Plant remains were primarily charcoal,
which came from the sediment matrix but must
also be associated with the clay surfaces. Although
a rock-filled basin hearth was found in the riverbank
near Profile 1, no recognizable living surface was
present adjacent to the top of the basin and the basin
was not distinctly oxidized by firing. As noted at Joe
Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988:351-367) and
elsewhere in Dallas (Skinner et al. 1978:72), sites
such as Dalbey have been under-reported and need
further attention. While excavation of such sites is
a slow process with low artifact yields, even when
large blocks are excavated, these site deposits offer
the opportunity to study brief occupation episodes
when they can be isolated in the field. Consequently,
the dateable and vertically stratified deposits present
at the Dalbey site make the site locally and regionally significant.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We want to thank Tim Dalbey for calling
attention to the site. Years of experience in the
Trinity River area and more than a year and a half
of monitoring the site led him to produce a report
that describes his site findings along the exposed
bank of the Trinity River. Omega Construction,
in particular Eric Starnes, Office Engineer, and
Tommy Hancock, Project Manager, are thanked
for their help. Also Snow Excavating and Alliance
Area Surveying assisted the project. Mary Ayala of
the City of Dallas’ Trinity River Corridor Project,
Skipper Scott, Fort Worth District office of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, and Bill Martin, THC,
were also very helpful.
