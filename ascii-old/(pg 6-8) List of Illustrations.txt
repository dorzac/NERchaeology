This picture of the Gibson Site and those of Plates 25 and 26
were made to record the facts by an Abilene photographer in
January, 1930, shortly after the writer found the Gibson Site.
The writer is pointing at the hearth level just below the eight
inch thick gravel stratum. Below the gravel layer is the Lower
Clear Fork Silt. The gravel stratum is the base of, and is a
narrow remnant of, the Upper Clear Fork Silt, which in this
site has been nearly all removed by ancient erosive forces;
above the gravel are the five Nugent Silts. This picture was
previously published in the Volume II, 1930, issue of ~is
Bulletin.
