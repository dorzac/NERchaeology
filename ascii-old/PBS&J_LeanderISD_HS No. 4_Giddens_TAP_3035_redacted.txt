ABSTRACT
At the request of the Leander Independent School District, PBS&J conducted a cultural
resources survey of a 137-acre (55-hectare) area in Williamson County, Texas, in January 2003. The
project area is proposed for future construction of a high school and related sports facilities (the proposed
Leander High School No. 4 Project). One historic site, 41WM1065, was located during this survey. It
contains an extant residential structure and two outbuildings that are associated with the house. Site
41WM1065 is not thought to be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark. No further investigation is recommended and cultural
resources clearance is recommended.

I. INTRODUCTION
In January 2003, PBS&J conducted a cultural resource survey of the proposed Giddens
Property Development project in southwestern Williamson County, Texas, under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 3035. The project area is proposed for future construction of a high school and related sports
facilities for the Leander Independent School District (LISD). The purpose of the investigation was to
locate, describe and document, and assess all existing cultural resources that may be affected by the
project. The investigation included a site records search, a review of historic maps, and an intensive
pedestrian survey with limited subsurface testing of an area of approximately 137 acres (55 hectares [ha]).
Rolling, hilly brush land of the Western Plains characterizes the southwestern part of Williamson County.
The project area is located along a gentle southern slope at the northeastern corner of County Road (CR)
272 and CR 271 in Leander, Texas (Figure 1).
The pedestrian survey was conducted by Tricia Blakistone and Jennifer Henley on
January 20 and 21, 2003, expending approximately three person days on the field portion of the
investigation. Work was conducted in compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Title 9,
Chapter 191, Texas Natural Resources Code of 1977) and other appropriate cultural resources legislation
and guidelines, as well as the guidelines set forth by the Register of Professional Archeologists and the
Council of Texas Archeologists (1992). The report is divided into several sections. Following this
introduction is an environmental background (Section II) that describes the natural setting of the study
area, including relevant information on the hydrology, underlying geology, flora, and fauna of the area.
Details on the research objectives and field methods are provided in Section III. Previous investigations
that place the project within the proper cultural resource framework and an overview of the region’s
archaeological background is provided in Section IV. Results of the survey are presented in Section V.
Conclusions and recommendations are provided in Section VI. Lastly, references cited in the text are
listed in Section VII. Appendix A presents all shovel test data.

II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
At the request of LISD, PBS&J conducted an Environmental Inspection (EI) of the
Giddens Property in addition to the current cultural resources survey. The EI included a Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment, Karst Survey, Endangered Species Habitat, and a Wetland
Determination. The following information on the environmental setting is based on the findings and
recommendations presented in the Environmental Inspection Report (McVey 2003), as well as some
generalized studies of the central Texas region in and around Williamson County.
GEOLOGY
Williamson County is bisected by the Balcones Escarpment, a geologic fault zone that
demarcates the Western Plains to the west from the Coastal Plains that extend to the gulf in the southeast.
Situated in the southwest part of the county, the rectangular-shaped project area lies among the low,
undulating hills of brush land characteristic of the Western Plains. Elevation ranges between 860 and
900 feet (262 and 275 meters [m]) above mean sea level.
Surface soils in the northern and eastern portions of the project area are characterized as
Eckrant cobbly clay. In general, this upland soil is calcareous, cobbly, and clayey soils formed on
coarsely fractured indurated limestone (Werchan and Coker 1983). It is usually dark grayish brown in
color. Running from the south-central portion of the project area northward for approximately 0.6 mile
(550 meters [m]) and then from that point to the east for another 0.6 mile (550 m) is Doss silty clay. This
is also an uplands soil and is characterized by a calcareous, moderately alkaline silty clay, usually dark
grayish brown in color (Werchan and Coker 1983). This Doss silty clay also appears in the southeast
corner of the property area. Doss silty clay surrounds two more types of soils present on the property.
Surrounding the area in which a small, unnamed drainage of Block House Creek runs is Fairlie clay. This
soil is usually found around drainages on uplands. This dark gray clay rests upon a weakly cemented
limestone and is found on gently sloping landscapes (1 to 2 percent). The soil is calcareous and
moderately alkaline (Werchan and Coker 1983). Finally, in a pocket of soil surrounded by Fairlie clay
and Eckrant cobbly clay in the eastern section of the project area exists Denton silty clay. The soil is
gently sloping (1 to 3 percent slopes) and typically consists of an upper layer of dark brown silty clay
about 33 inches (84 centimeters [cm]) grading to a very pale brown silty clay loam to 36 inches (91 cm)
(Werchan and Coker 1983).
CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGY
The climate of Williamson County is subtropical with a growing season averaging
258 days. Temperatures in the area range from an average high of 96 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) in July to
an average low of 36°F in January. Rainfall averages 34 inches (86 cm) annually onto well-drained soils,

441176/030035

providing a medium amount of runoff (Ramos 1996). Brushy Creek, a perennial stream is located about
1 kilometer (km) to the north and Block House Creek, a seasonal stream, is located about 1 km to the
south-southeast. A small, unnamed, intermittent first-order drainage and tributary of Block House Creek
bisects the southeastern corner of the project area.
FLORA
Williamson County is located on the boundary between the Blackland Prairies and Cross
Timbers and Prairies vegetational areas of Texas (Hatch et al. 1990). The Edwards Plateau vegetational
area borders these two areas on the southwest. The Williamson County region represents an ecotone
between these three vegetational areas. Historically, the climax vegetation of this region consisted of big
bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), indiangrass (Sorghastrum
nutans), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), side-oats gramma (Bouteloua curtipendula), and buffalograss
(Buchloe dactyloides). Overgrazing and suppression of naturally occurring wild fires have led to the
increase of woody species such as Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa),
and live oak (Quercus fusiformis), with an understory composed of saw greenbriar (Smilax bona-nox),
fragrant sumac (Rhus aromatica), and bumelia (Bumelia lanuginosa). Prairie forbs once common in this
region included western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), gayfeathers (Liatris spp.), bushclover
(Lespedeza sp.), and various sunflowers (Asteraceae); however, croton (Croton spp.), Mexican hat
(Ratibida columnaris), and nightshades (Solanum spp.) have generally increased in abundance in recent
times (Gould 1975; Vines 1960).
The project area is composed of upland woodland vegetation with areas of open
grassland dispersed between the woodland groves. A terraced pasture makes up the middle section of the
surveyed area. The most commonly encountered trees in the upland woodland community are live oak,
Ashe juniper and cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia). Texas red oak (Q. buckleyi), post oak (Q. stellata), and
sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata) may also occur in this community type. The shrub layer in this
community, though often sparse, may include Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), yaupon (Ilex
vomitoria), elbowbush (Forestiera pubescens), agarito (Berberis trifoliata), fragrant sumac, flameleaf
sumac (R. lanceolata), and American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana). Common woody vines of this
region include saw greenbriar, common greenbriar (S. rotundifolia), southern dewberry (Rubus trivialis),
Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), mustang grape (Vitis mustangensis), Virginia creeper
(Parthenocissus cinquefolia), and poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Typical herbaceous species
include little bluestem, panicums (Panicum spp.), Texas winter-grass (Stipa leucotricha), Mexican hat,
and pricklypear (Opuntia lindheimeri), among others (Vines 1960). Common grasses of these
communities include little bluestem, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), King Ranch bluestem
(B. ischaemum), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense), bermudagrass
(Cynodon dactylon), brome grasses (Bromus spp.), dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum), and perennial
ryegrass (Lolium perenne), among others. Typical forb species include Mexican hat, Indian blanket

(Gaillardia pulchella), Dakota verbena (Verbena bipinnatifida), Texas dandelion (Pyrrhopappus
multicaulis), lemon beebalm (Monarda citriodora), plantain (Plantago sp.), evening primrose (Oenothera
speciosa), and goldenrods (Solidago spp.), among others. Brush species such as eastern baccharis
(Baccharis halimifolia), Texas persimmon, Ashe juniper, tickle-tongue (Zanthoxylum hirsutum), agarito,
and pricklypear also occur in unimproved grasslands. (Gould 1975; Vines 1960).
FAUNA
Williamson County lies at the interface of the Texan and Balconian biotic provinces as
described by Blair (1950). The fauna of the project area is representative of the ecotone between these
two provinces, with many species reaching their respective eastern or western distribution limits in this
area. Wildlife habitat types closely coincide with the upland woodlands and grassland vegetational
communities described above.
The upland woods within the project area are typical live oak-Ashe juniper woodlands.
Characteristic woodland fauna include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), eastern cottontail
(Sylvilagus floridanus), common raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), and avian
species such as the Carolina chickadee (Pachouli carolinensis), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis),
western scrub jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), ladder-backed woodpecker (Picoides scalaris), and
mourning dove (Zenaida macroura). Common herpetofauna include the green anole (Anolis
carolinensis), Texas spiny lizard (Scleoporus olivaceus), ground skink (Scincella lateralis), and broadbanded copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix laticinctus) (Davis and Schmidly 1994; Dickinson 1999;
Dixon 2000).
Grassland habitats within the project area may support faunal species common to the
region. Mammalian species characteristic of this habitat type include the eastern cottontail, hispid cotton
rat (Sigmodon hispidus), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), and the nine-banded armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus). Common birds include the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove, and killdeer (Charadrius vociferus). Herpetofauna
(amphibians and reptiles) typical of this habitat include the six-lined racerunner (Cnemidophorous
sexlineatus), Texas rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta lindheimerii), and the Gulf Coast toad (Bufo valliceps)
(Davis and Schmidly 1994; Dickinson 1999; Dixon 2000).

III. RESEARCH DESIGN
The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National Park
Service criteria (35 CFR, Part 60.4), which present the guidelines for determining eligibility of a cultural
resource for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The objectives of the
program were 1) to locate any cultural resources within the area of potential effect from the proposed
construction; 2) to assess their potential for NRHP eligibility or official designation as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL); 3) to assess the effect of the proposed construction on located resources;
and 4) to provide resource-specific recommendations for mitigation of adverse impact to any significant
properties.
In December 2002, PBS&J conducted a records search at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) and the Texas Historical Commission for the identification of previous
cultural resource investigations and previously recorded sites, including sites listed in or eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or designated as SALs. Historic maps available at the Texas State Library dating
to 1893 and 1936 were also reviewed.
Typical Central Texas sites are generally composed of accumulations of chipped stones,
burned rocks, and utilitarian objects that are the residue of prehistoric occupations. In areas with shallow
soils, evidence of prehistoric inhabitants is typically visible on the surface. On January 20 and 21, 2003,
PBS&J conducted a 100 percent survey of the project area utilizing parallel pedestrian transects spaced
approximately 30 m apart. Visual inspection of the ground surface was augmented by shovel tests placed
judgmentally throughout the project area (Figure 2). Each shovel test was excavated in 10-cm levels to a
depth where clearly sterile substrates were encountered.

IV. CULTURAL BACKGROUND
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The Brushy Creek watershed has long been noted for its archaeological resources.
Between 1918 and 1930, J.E. Pearce and Roy Bedichek conducted excavations along Brushy Creek and
its tributaries including the Walsh estate site (41WM11), a group of four burned rock middens on Lake
Creek south of Round Rock (Pearce 1938:3−11, 25−30). In 1959, nine burned rock middens were
identified northeast of the project area on Chandler Branch at the Dedear site (identified by two
trinomials: 41WM15 and 41WM239). Limited salvage excavations were conducted on one of the
middens at the Dedear site in 1964 by the Travis County Archeological Society (TARL files).
In 1981, the Texas Department of Water Resources (TDWR) conducted a cultural
resources survey along Brushy Creek east of the project area.

They identified and recorded 10

archaeological sites (41WM12 and 41WM462−41WM470) representing both prehistoric and historic
period occupations. Sites 41WM12, 41WM463, 41WM467, and 41WM468 were recommended for
testing to determine significance and 41WM465 (Kenney's Fort) was considered to be archeologically
significant and potentially eligible for nomination to the NRHP (Fox et al. 1981).
During a cultural resources survey in preparation for an extension of Farm-to-Market
Road 1431, three sites were encountered along Brushy and Spanish Oak Creeks about 0.9 mile (1.5 km)
north of the project area. One of these sites, Wilson-Leonard (41WM235), has subsequently been
excavated and contains the most complete temporal sequence of prehistoric archeological assemblages
from a single site in Central Texas (Collins 1998; Masson and Collins 1995).
In the South Brushy Creek drainage south of the project area, three archaeological
reconnaissance surveys were conducted by the TDWR. The surveys were for proposed wastewater
improvements and totaled 902 acres (365 ha). Conducted in 1980, 1981, and 1984, the surveys resulted
in the location of 19 cultural resources sites:

41WM439−41WM441, 41WM444−41WM456, and

41WM543−41WM545, respectively, including 15 prehistoric sites and 4 multicomponent historic/
prehistoric period sites. Additional testing to determine possible significance for NRHP eligibility was
recommended for eight sites: 41WM439, 41WM446, 41WM447, 41WM451, and 41WM453−41WM456
(Whitsett 1981).
In 1984, Prewitt and Associates conducted a survey known as the Ideal Basic Tract,
which encompassed a broad transect running north to south from South Brushy Creek across adjacent
lowlands and into the uplands. Three sites were recorded, including sites 41WM653 and 41WM654, that
are in proximity to the present project area. None of these sites were recommended for further
investigation (Coffman et al. 1985).

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
Native Americans have occupied Central Texas for more than 11,000 years. What is
known of these early inhabitants is based on a continually evolving assessment of the archeological
record. Foremost in the quest for understanding is the effort put into developing a chronology. The
diverse environmental setting and the multitude of cultures that occupied this area in the past makes the
establishment of definite period indicators difficult. This is compounded when sites possess few
diagnostic tools or multiple occupations are intermixed. Following is an overview of the nearly complete
continuum of habitation for the Central Texas area. Because of the fluid nature of any regional
chronology, and because the results of the present investigation do not contribute any significant detail to
the development of the chronology, the archeological background is general and reflects only those time
period divisions that have traditionally have been used for Central Texas.
Traditionally, the prehistoric cultural sequence is divided into several stages based on
observed differences in tools or site patterns. These are the Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and
Historic.
The Paleoindian stage (pre-10,000 to ca. 6500 B.C.) is the earliest known prehistoric
cultural sequence in the Central Texas archaeological area. Traditionally, this stage has been
characterized by highly mobile bands of people that relied heavily on big game hunting of Pleistocene
megafauna. However, the paucity of Paloeoindian sites containing megafaunal remains (such as Bison
antiquus) combined with the data collected over the past few decades of central Texas archeology
indicate that the traditional view is oversimplified. In Central Texas, Paleoindian sites commonly occur
as small, dispersed lithic scatters, usually located in upland areas near drainages. Such sites are thought to
represent temporary campsites, resource procurement loci, or toolmaking stations of small groups of
people. Projectile points such as Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview are characteristic of this stage and are
distinguished by their lanceolate shape and basal fluting.
A diversification in subsistence strategies is present in the archeological record, marking
the beginning of the Archaic stage (6500 B.C. to A.D. 700). This long period of time represents a
successful adaptive strategy of prehistoric inhabitants who began exploiting a wider variety of small game
in addition to foraging for edible plants. The Archaic is traditionally divided into Early, Middle, and Late
periods. Division between the three subperiods is based on distinctive projectile point/knife types and a
variation in some of the economic pursuits. Projectile point types representative of the Early Archaic
period include Wells, Gower, Bandy, Martindale, and Tortugas. These diverse projectile point types are
indicators that different cultural groups were developing around 5000 B.C. The presence of large scatters
of burned rock, a by-product of starchy food processing, is common to the earlier part of this stage. The
Middle Archaic is characterized by an increase in population as well as lithic artifacts. The Pedernales is
the distinctive point of this subperiod. During the Late Archaic settlements occupied terrace locations, and

441176/030035

9

rockshelters became increasingly utilized. Point types such as Darl, Ensor, and Frio are characteristic of
the Late Archaic (Turner and Hester 1985).
In Central Texas, the Late Prehistoric stage (A.D. 700 to European contact) is a
continuation of mobile hunting and gathering sustenance strategies of previous stages. Small projectile
points associated with the advent of bow-and-arrow technology make an appearance in the archaeological
record, as do ceramics and agriculture, brought about by more-sedentary settlement patterns. The Late
Prehistoric stage is represented by the Austin and Toyah phases. The Austin phase (ca. A.D. 700−1300) is
characterized by expanding-stemmed and small subtriangular points (such as Scallorn and Granbury),
serrated flakes, and Friday-type bifaces.
Diagnostic artifacts of the later Toyah phase
(ca. A.D. 1300−1750) include small pointed-stemmed points (Perdiz and Clifton), Covington-type knives,
drills, and tools made from bison bone. The latter part of this stage is evidenced by the appearance of
limited ceramic usage and cemeteries. Ceramics associated with this stage are of the bone-tempered Leon
Plain type.
During the early portion of the Historic stage (European contact to present), at the time of
initial European contact and settlement, Central Texas was inhabited by numerous aboriginal groups
including the Jumano, Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche (Newcomb 1961). Native tribes of the
eastern United States were displaced from their traditional homelands by the westward spread of AngloAmerican and European groups in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and immigrant Indian tribes,
such as the Delaware, moved to Central Texas. Trade items such as glass beads, European-made
ceramics, gun parts, and metal projectile points are indicative of a contact-period occupation, although
such sites are relatively rare.
Ultimately, the hostility of Apache and Comanche tribes who frequented Central Texas
forced the abandonment of most Spanish missions in Texas. Following Mexico's defeat of the Spanish
Empire in 1821, these tribes still maintained a presence in the area. No permanent settlement north of San
Antonio was attempted until 1805 when the Spanish established a garrison at the road ford of the
Colorado River at the present location of the city of Bastrop.
In the Republic period (1836−1845), the earliest land grants issued in what would
become Williamson County were typically issued to men who had participated in the war for
independence from Mexico. Early Anglo settlement in Williamson County tended to be from the
southern states of the United States, primarily from Tennessee and Arkansas.
The city of Leander was established in 1882 when the Austin and Northwestern Railroad
built a railroad line from Austin to Llano, bypassing the city of Bagdad, a mile to the west of present-day
Leander. The merchants in Bagdad moved their business to be nearer to the railroad and the new city of
Leander was established (Tyler 1996).

V. RESULTS
A review of a map of Williamson County shows the town of Leander approximately
2 miles (3.5 km) east-southeast of the project area. The surveyed area lies at the northeast corner of the
intersection of CR 201 and CR 202.
Topographically, the project area is located along a gentle southern slope. Brushy Creek,
a perennial stream, is located about 0.6 mile (1 km) to the north and Block House Creek, a seasonal
stream, is located about 0.6 mile (1 km) to the south-southeast. The nearest source of water is a small
intermittent first-order drainage and tributary of Block House Creek that bisects the southeastern corner of
the project area. The soil that surrounds this drainage is described as Fairlie clay. This soil consists of a
dark gray clay. A majority of the project area consists of Eckrant cobbly clay, a dark grayish brown clay
primarily consisting of limestone. Also found in the project area, to a lesser degree, is Doss silty clay and
Denton silty clay (Werchan and Coker 1983).
Vegetation of the project area consisted primarily of juniper, live oak, and cedar trees
with sparse grasses and other shrubby vegetation. Surface visibility of the project area ranged from about
40 to 80 percent, averaging about 60 percent. During the current survey effort, 131 shovel tests were
excavated (Figure 2). All of the tests exhibited a dark brown silty clay surface soil with sparse to dense
limestone gravel and cobbles intermixed. The average shovel test terminated at 10 cm below the surface
because the shallow, upland residual soils were judged to lack potential to contain buried deposits. No
artifacts were encountered in any of the shovel tests.
During the survey, one cultural resource site, 41WM1065, was recorded.

Standing

architectural remains at the site include an abandoned house, two smaller outbuildings, an elevated water
tank, and a windmill. The site is situated about 0.4 mile (0.6 km) north of CR 202 along CR 201 and
about 164 ft (50 m) east of the road (Appendix A). The site is estimated to be 295 ft (90 m) in length
(east-west) and 131 ft (40 m) in width (north-south) based on the area that the house and the two
outbuildings encompass (Figure 3).
The house is a simple, unstyled, side-gabled farmhouse composed of five rooms
(Figure 4). The walls are constructed of vertical wooden planking, and appear to rest on large limestone
foundation stones (Figure 5). The first four rooms, probably used as a kitchen, master bedroom, living
room, and entrance way/secondary bedroom form a rectangle measuring 29 ft (9 m) (north-south) by 39 ft
(12 m) (east-west). A covered porch and a fifth room extend across the southern portion of the house,
forming a 10 ft (3 m) (north-south) by 39 ft (12 m) (east-west) rectangular area. Thus, the overall
dimensions of the building are 39 x 39 ft (12 x 12 m). This fifth room appears to be an addition, or
possibly an enclosed portion of an original porch, as the wood used in the construction of the room’s
exterior walls is lighter in color and less distressed than the wood comprising the rest of the structure.

Also, it was built in a different manner than the rest of the house, with the siding running horizontally and
the windows screened in rather than containing pane glass. In addition, the roof is a simple shed that
extends past the outer walls, creating an overhang.
The house is currently used for storage. A cursory inventory of the inside revealed
mattress springs, buckets, trunks, old furniture (including a refrigerator), children’s toys, clothing, and
boxes. Furniture still remaining within the house is indicative of the function of each room. For example,
one room still holds an electric stove, a counter top, and cabinets. Another room holds mattress springs
and a closet. Yet another room contains a fireplace. The fireplace is located on the western wall of the
house and is constructed of limestone blocks. The house has been wired for electricity and contains light
fixtures that hang from the ceiling. Therefore, it was probably occupied into at least the mid-twentieth
century. A modern house exists nearby in which the Giddens family presently lives.
The home is surrounded by a scatter of modern junk, including tires, a bicycle, a grill,
fencing material, cans and bottles, cinder blocks, and broken modern glass. However, some whiteware
was discovered on the east side of the house. None of these ceramics had any type of pattern or maker’s
mark that could be used to indicate their age. A few bottlenecks belonging to bottles that were probably
sealed with corks were discovered as well as a few pieces of amethyst glass. Amethyst glass generally
dates to between 1880 and 1925 (Armour 1970). Even though the house is constructed of wood planking,
several bricks surrounded the house, bearing the words “Whiteselle Cherry Reds Corsicana.” These
bricks measure 7? x 3½ x 2¼ inches and are dry-pressed bricks. Whiteselle Corsicana of Navarro
County, Texas, has manufactured this common type of brick since 1892 to the present (Steinbomer 1982).
To the north of the home, about 30 ft (9 m) away, exists an elevated water tank and a
windmill. Next to the windmill is a small building, measuring 16 x 10 ft (5 x 3 m) and constructed in the
same manner as the house (Figure 6a). It includes only one room with a door and a window facing to the
south, and its original purpose cannot be ascertained. It currently houses a workbench and tools. About
230 ft (70 m) to the southeast of the house is another outbuilding constructed in a similar manner to the
house (Figure 6b). It measures 13 x 13 ft (4 x 4 m) and has a wooden floor. It is also comprised of one
room with a door facing to the south. One window, facing the north, can be found on the wall opposite of
the door. The building is currently filled with modern debris, and its original purpose cannot be deduced.
To the east of this structure lies a modern barn. This barn was reportedly built on top of the original barn
that, according to the landowner, burned down when hit by lightening (Giddens 2003).
Originally the archaeologists planned on performing shovel tests radiating in the cardinal
directions from the house in 10-m increments. However, upon testing the ground, they discovered the
soil to contain about 90 to 95 percent white gravel. The soil of the site location has been mapped as
Eckrant cobbly clay: a shallow, calcareous clay common to uplands in the region. Therefore, the ground
is impregnable in this area and no shovel tests could be performed. The present environmental setting is a

grazing area for goats. Also, the area to the west of the house has been used as a dumping ground for
modern debris.
It is noteworthy to mention that the owner of the property on which the buildings are
located, Henry Giddens, reported to archaeologists that his mother was born in the house they were
recording (Giddens 2003). Since Mr. Giddens is approximately 80 years old, that makes the house
approximately 100 years old or more. Examination of a 1936 Williamson County highway map shows a
residence in the same area as site 41WM1065 (Texas State Highway Department 1936). Therefore, it was
probably erected in the late nineteenth century or very early twentieth century.
Considering the ubiquitous methods and materials of construction, its poor physical
condition, and its lack of prominent historical associations, the house and site do not appear to qualify for
National Register eligibility under Criteria A, B, or C (Foster 2003). Archeologically, the site appears to
offer little information potential that would contribute significantly to our understanding of rural farm life
in Williamson County in the late nineteenth to early twentieth century.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The pedestrian survey of the proposed development area of Leander High School
Number 4 located one cultural resource site, 41WM1065, which is not thought to be eligible for the
NRHP or designation as a SAL. Site 41WM1065 represents a historic structure that possesses no
historical or architectural significance. Due to the large degree of surface visibility and the shallow
upland soils that dominate the project area, the likelihood of significant unlocated cultural resource
deposits eligible for the NRHP or official designation as a SAL within the project area is thought to be
minimal. No further investigation or special precautions are thought to be necessary.
If, during construction and maintenance, previously unrecorded cultural resources are
encountered, the State Historic Preservation Officer should be contacted to assess the remains and provide
recommendations as to how to deal with the site under the state’s historic preservation plan.
