ABSTRACT

Othon, Inc., contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC of Houston, Texas, to perform
an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey and deep testing of approximately 6 acres
(2.4 hectares) of property within Zube Park in northwest Harris County, Texas. Project plans
indicate that a detention basin, access road, two parking lots, and three drainage channels are
proposed for construction within the project area.
The property associated with the project area is owned by the Harris County Public
Infrastructure Department in Harris County, Texas and managed by Harris County Precinct
Three. Federal agencies involved include the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, the lead federal agency, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers,
Galveston District.
The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #4251, issued by the
Texas Historical Commission’s Division of Archeology in September 2006. All fieldwork
and reporting activities were completed with reference to state (the Antiquities Code of
Texas) and federal (National Historic Preservation Act [NHPA] 1966; Secretary or the
Interior’s Standards and Guidelines 1981, 1983) law and guidance for conducting cultural
resources surveys pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA (Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation 2001).
Fieldwork was conducted between October 10 and 11, 2006 and resumed again
October 23, under the supervision of Principal Investigator James Hughey. Survey activities
were designed to assess the potential impact that construction of the detention basin, access
road, parking lots, and drainage channels may have on any cultural resources located within
the project boundary. The project’s Area of Potential Effect, included all property proposed
for construction and was subjected to an intensive pedestrian survey with the excavation of
24 shovel tests and the mechanical excavation of two trenches in an area covering
approximately 6 acres (2.4 hectares).
Archaeological investigation conducted within both the area proposed for detention
basin construction and in the areas proposed for access road, parking lot, and drainage
channel construction indicates that intact buried cultural resources are unlikely to be present
due to the some previous disturbance such as creek channalization and architectural
landscaping as well as the presence of soils containing a significant amount of iron
concretions, an indicator that the land is frequently flooded or saturated with water.
During this investigation, the pedestrian survey in conjunction with shovel testing and
mechanical trenching did not result in the identification of any cultural resources or historic
structures within the APE. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological
work is required, and that the project be cleared to proceed as planned.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

Othon, Inc., contracted with HRA Gray & Pape, LLC of Houston, Texas, to perform
an intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey and deep testing of approximately 6 acres
(2.4 hectares) of property proposed for construction within Zube Park in northwest Harris
County, Texas. The property associated with the project area is owned by the Harris County
Public Infrastructure Department in Harris County, Texas and managed by Harris County
Precinct Three. Federal agencies involved include the Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) and the United States Army Corps of Engineers, (USACE) Galveston
District.
The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #4251, issued by the
Texas Historical Commission’s (THCs) Division of Archeology in September 2006. All
fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to state (the Antiquities
Code of Texas) and federal (National Historic Preservation Act [NHPA] 1966; Secretary or
the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines 1981, 1983) law and guidance for conducting cultural
resources surveys pursuant to Section 106 of the NHPA (Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation 2001).
Field Director Kristi Turner, and Archaeological Technicians Julia Balakirova and
Glen Wagner conducted fieldwork on October 10 and 11, 2006 and October 23, under the
supervision of Principal Investigator James Hughey. Fieldwork required 50 person hours to
complete. Ms. Turner completed site file research prior to fieldwork mobilization. Ms.
Turner also prepared the content of this report. Mr. Scott prepared the graphics and Mr.
Hughey edited the report. Melinda Mendoza-Scott produced the report.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project Area of Potential Effect (APE) is located on the United States Geological
Survey (USGS) 7.5’ Hockley, Texas (1996) topographic quadrangle map within an existing
recreational park known as Zube Park. The project area is at Little Cypress Creek
immediately east of Roberts Road between Zube Road and Bauer Road (Figure 1).
The APE is defined as all property within the construction footprint of a proposed
detention basin, two parking lots, three narrow drainage channels, and an access road.
Subsurface disturbance within the in the APE will occur at a maximum estimated depth of
1.2-2.0 meters (4-6 feet) in the area proposed for construction of the detention basin. The
total area proposed for construction within the APE encompasses approximately 6 acres (2.4
hectares) of land within Zube Park. Disturbances within and adjacent to the project area
include previous high-tension utility corridor construction, channalization of Little Cypress
Creek and some minimal architectural landscaping.

CHAPTER II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The project area primarily consists of leveled topography covered with very short
lawn grass for recreational purposes within the park. The project area is bisected by Little
Cypress Creek, which has been channelized and runs northwest to southeast across the center
of the project area. The southern and eastern boundaries of the project area are made up of
secondary growth primarily composed of low shrubs and sapling trees.

SOILS
Soils within the project area have been classified as Wockley fine sandy loam (Wo)
(Wheeler 1976). Wockley fine sandy loam is found on level, broad areas that are mostly
prairie and forested land. This soil is somewhat poorly drained. Wockley fine sandy loam
generally has five strata. The surface stratum consists of a dark grayish sandy loam that
extends from the ground surface to 17.8 centimeters (7 inches). The second stratum contains
a layer of brown fine sandy loam that extends from the base of the first strata to
approximately 55.9 centimeters (22 inches). This followed by a layer that consists of brown
sandy clay loam that has red, light brownish red, and yellowish brown mottles. This layer
extends form 55.9 centimeters (22 inches) to 83.8 centimeters (33 inches). The fourth
stratum contains light brownish gray sandy clay loam mottled with red, light gray, and
yellowish brown (Wheeler 1976).

CHAPTER III. CULTURE HISTORY

Based on aspects of material culture, researchers have identified six archaeological
time periods associated with Native Americans in southeast Texas; in general, these include
the Paleoindian, Archaic (with Early, Middle, and Late subdivisions), Ceramic, Late
Prehistoric, Protohistoric, and Historic Indian. Archaeologists within the region agree on the
general framework of cultural time periods, while disagreeing on the temporal boundaries of
these periods. Patterson’s (1995) chronology, for example, includes Early Paleoindian
(10,000-8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000-5000 B.C.), Early Archaic (5000-3000 B.C.),
Middle Archaic (3000-1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.-A.D. 100), Early Ceramic (A.D.
100-A.D. 600), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600-1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500-1700), and the
Historic Indian (A.D. 1700-1800) periods. In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a Southeast Texas
chronology that includes Paleoindian (10,000-8000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8000-5000 B.C.),
Middle Archaic (5000-1000 B.C.), Late Archaic (1000 B.C.-A.D. 400), Early Ceramic (A.D.
400-A.D. 800), and Late Ceramic (A.D. 800-A.D. 1750). Despite these differences, the
chronologies developed by researchers are based primarily on changes in projectile point
technologies within the region and the introduction of pottery. It is generally recognized that
a broad-based hunting and gathering lifestyle was utilized throughout all time periods.
Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal
Plain tend to be composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits reflecting short-term occupation
episodes. In general, these sites consist of temporally non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin
subsurface deposits, or suggest the presence of multiple cultural components within a mixed
stratigraphic archaeological context. Historic sites near the project area typically consist of
farm or homesteads dating to the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries.

CHAPTER IV. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

BACKGROUND RESEARCH
Background research was initiated prior to fieldwork mobilization, and included a
review of archaeological site files, architectural resource files, and previously conducted
cultural resource surveys in the project vicinity. This information was collected by
consultation of the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas, on-line resource maintained by the
THC.

FIELD METHODOLOGY
Field investigation consisted of a walkover survey across the entire project area. The
pedestrian survey was augmented with shovel testing, mechanical trenching within the APE.
Shovel tests were excavated in areas where impacts associated with the construction of an
access road, two parking lots, and three narrow drainage channels are anticipated. Depths
associated with construction in these areas are not expected to reach below 0.65 meters (2
feet). Mechanical trenching was conducted in the area anticipated for detention basin
construction as the depth of impact is expected to reach below one meter (3 feet).

Intensive Pedestrian Survey
Near surface testing consisted of the placement of a series of 30-centimeter (11- inch)
diameter shovel tests excavated into sterile soil within sections of the APE where impacts are
expected to be shallow (access road, parking lots, and drainage channels). The research
design developed for this project called for the excavation of 24 shovel tests within the
project area, placed between 30 and 60-meter (100 and 200-foot) staggered intervals along
one to two transects. Vertical control was maintained by excavating each shovel test in
arbitrary 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels. One wall of each shovel test was profiled and the
walls and floor of each shovel test were inspected for color or texture change potentially
associated with the presence of cultural features. Soils were screened through ¼-inch wire
mesh. Descriptions of soil texture and color associated with each stratum followed standard
terminology and the Munsell (2000) soil color charts. Additional information concerning soils
encountered was recorded on standardized forms.
On average, shovel tests were excavated to a depth of 50 centimeters (19.68 inches)
and terminated. Generally, dense concentrations of iron concretions were encountered below
this depth; a signal that the area is prone to frequent flooding or is frequently saturated with
water. Furthermore, as impacts are not anticipated below 60 centimeters (24 inches) for the

5

construction of the access road, parking lots, or drainage channels, shovel tests typically were
not excavated much deeper than 75 centimeters (29.5 inches).

Deep Testing
Deep testing was conducted within the APE in the area proposed for detention basin
construction. This method of investigation consisted of the mechanical excavation of two
trenches using a backhoe with a flat smooth-edged bucket. Each trench was excavated from
north to south and to an average length of 15 meters (50 feet). The trenches were excavated
by scraping at arbitrary 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels to an average depth of 1.70 meters (5.6
feet), as depths of impacts are expected to range between 1.25 and two meters (four and six
feet). Descriptions of soil texture and color associated with each stratum followed standard
terminology and the Munsell (2000) soil color charts. Additional information concerning soils
encountered was recorded on standardized forms.

Global Positioning System (GPS) and Photographic Documentation
In addition to a pedestrian survey augmented with shovel test excavation and
mechanical trenching, GPS data was collected using a handheld unit and photographs of the
entire project area were captured. GPS coordinates were gathered at the location of each
shovel test and at the northern and southern ends of both trenches. Representative
photographs of the project area were captured and documented on a photo-log. Other photodocumentation includes soil profiles of the east walls of both trenches and general overview
photographs of each trench.

CHAPTER V. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

A total of five previous archaeological investigations were conducted within 1.6kilometer (1-mile) of the proposed project area. None of these surveys took place within the
current project area.
In 1986, a linear cultural resources survey was conducted near Bauer Road
immediately southeast of the current project area. Based on data provided on the Texas
Archaeological Sites Atlas, an online resource maintained by the THC, no additional
information is available regarding this survey.
The State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (1988) conducted an
archaeological survey west of the project area in 1988. The survey was conducted over 27.3
kilometers (17 miles) along United States Highway 290 from Badtke Road in Hockley to
State Highway 6 north of Hempstead. During this survey, two previously unidentified sites
(41WL13 and 41WL99) were recorded.
Based on data provided on the Texas
Archaeological Sites Atlas, an online resource maintained by the THC, no information is
available regarding recommendations for work at either site.
In 1995, another archaeological survey was conducted west of the current project area
on behalf of the Federal Highway Administration. Following this survey, another
archaeological investigation was conducted southwest of the current project area by the
Texas Department of Transportation in 2004. Based on data provided on the Texas
Archaeological Sites Atlas, an online resource maintained by the THC, no additional
information is available regarding these surveys.
In 2003, the Lower Colorado River Authority’s archeology staff conducted numerous
cultural resources assessments and published the results in an annual report. Of these
assessments, one of these was conducted west northwest of the current project area at
Hockley Road (Malof et al. 2005). Based on data provided on the Texas Archaeological
Sites Atlas, an online resource maintained by the THC, no additional information is available
regarding this survey.

CHAPTER VI. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

No new archaeological sites or historic standing structures were encountered as a
result of the intensive pedestrian survey. The results of the site file review are presented
below. This is followed by a discussion of the results of survey within the APE.

RESULTS OF BACKGROUND RESEARCH
There were no previously recorded archaeological sites within the project area; however,
there is one previously identified archaeological site (41HR574) within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile)
radius of the project area. There were no architectural resources or National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) properties located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project area.
Site 41HR574 is located approximately 1.55 kilometers (0.93 mile) southeast of the
current project area (see Figure 1). This site is known as the Becker House and is located on
the Hockley, Texas USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map. It is located east of
Becker Road along an unimproved farm road approximately 380 (1200 feet) west of Cypress
Ringed Pond. Cultural Resource Services, Inc. recorded the Becker House in 1986 (Hudson
et al. 1986). It is composed of a house/farm and is estimated to have been in use between
1916 and 1965. The house is estimated to be approximately 80% intact. No further work
was recommended at site 41HR574, the Becker House.

RESULTS OF INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY AND DEEP TESTING
Intensive Pedestrian Survey
A total of 24 shovel tests were excavated within the APE in 30 and 60-meter (100 and
200-foot) staggered intervals along one to two transects in the areas proposed for the
construction of the access road, parking lots, and drainage channels (Figure 2). Descriptions
of the results of work conducted in each of these areas are provided below. Detailed
descriptions of each shovel test are provided in Appendix A.
Along the proposed access road, four shovel tests were excavated at a 60-meter (200foot) interval. Soils within this area generally consisted of brown (10YR5/3) silty sand with
ferrous oxide concretions below 30 centimeters (11.81 inches). Because construction plans
are expected to result in shallow impacts, and due to the high iron content observed, shovel
tests were not excavated to a full meter (3 feet) in depth. No cultural resources, features, or
historic structures were encountered during survey along the proposed access road.
Within the two parking lots, designated as the “south parking lot” and “north parking
lot”, a total of 14 shovel tests were excavated. Soils within the south parking lot typically

8

consisted two strata. The first stratum was most commonly composed of brown (10YR5/3)
to pale brown (10YR6/3) sandy to silty loam followed by yellowish brown (10YR6/4) sandy
to silty loam with iron concretions below 45 centimeters (17.71 inches). Shovel tests in the
area proposed for the south parking lot were excavated to an average depth of 55 centimeters
(21.65 inches). Because construction plans are expected to result in shallow impacts, and
due to the high iron content observed, shovel tests were not excavated to a full meter (3 feet)
in depth. No cultural resources, features, or historic structures were encountered during
survey within the area proposed for the south parking lot.
Shovel tests within the area proposed for construction of the north parking lot
typically included soils composed of brown (10YR5/3) compact very fine sandy loam.
Shovel tests were excavated to an average depth of 35 centimeters (13.78 inches). Because
construction plans are expected to result in shallow impacts, and due to the high iron content
observed, shovel tests were not excavated to a full meter (3 feet) in depth. No cultural
resources, features, or historic structures were encountered during survey within the area
proposed for the north parking lot.
A series of two shovel tests were placed in each of the three areas proposed for
drainage channels (Figure 2). Soils in these areas were generally made up of two strata. The
first strata consisted of very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) to dark grayish brown (10YR4/2)
loam. Below this, soils were recorded as pale brown (10YR6/3) to grayish brown (10YR5/2)
silty sand to silty loam with iron concretions or stains. Shovel tests within the proposed
drainage channels were excavated to an average depth of 50 centimeters (19.68 inches).
Because construction plans are expected to result in shallow impacts, and due to the high iron
content observed, shovel tests were not excavated to a full meter (3 feet) in depth. No
cultural resources, features, or historic structures were encountered during survey within the
areas proposed for the three drainage channels.

Deep Testing
In the area of the proposed detention basin, a total of two trenches were mechanically
excavated using a track hoe with a smooth-edged bucket. The use a smooth-edged bucket
allowed scraping in 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels so that archaeologists could carefully
examine the trench walls as they were exposed. The trenches were placed approximately 30
meters (100 feet) apart. Each trench was oriented in a north to south fashion. Both trenches
measured approximately 15 meters (50 feet) in length and were excavated to an average
depth of 170 centimeters (5.6 feet). No cultural resources, features, or historic structures
were encountered during the excavation of both trenches. Descriptions of each trench are
provided below.
Trench 1 was located at the northern end of the proposed detention basin south of
Little Cypress Creek (Figures 2 and 3). Trench 1 contained four strata and was excavated to
a maximum depth of 180 centimeters (5.7 feet) (Figure 3). Stratum I was composed of dark
grayish brown (10YR4/2) fine sandy loam that extended from the ground surface to
approximately 33 centimeters (13.00 inches) below the surface. This stratum contained few

fine sandy loam that extended from the base of Stratum I to approximately 70 centimeters
(26.76 inches) below the surface and contained more frequent iron concretions and some
crayfish krotovinas. Stratum III ranged in depth from 70 centimeters (27.55 inches) to 144
centimeters (56.70 inches) below the surface and was composed of light yellowish brown
sandy clay loam. This stratum contained a very high concentration of iron and ironstone
nodules. Finally, Stratum IV ranged from the base of Stratum III to 180 centimeters (70.87

CHAPTER VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This report presents the findings of an intensive pedestrian survey and deep testing
conducted within 6 acres (2.4 hectares) of property proposed for the construction a detention
basin, an access road, two parking lots, and three drainage channels at Zube Park located in
northwest Harris County, Texas. The project is supported by the Harris County Public
Infrastructure Department.
Prior to fieldwork mobilization, initial investigation consisted of a background
literature and site files search to identify the presence of recorded cultural resources in close
proximity to the project property. Background research identified no previously recorded
cultural resources within the project area and only one previously recorded site (41HR574)
within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the project area.
The current archaeological survey did not result in the identification of any newly
recorded archaeological sites within the APE. Archaeological investigation conducted within
both the area proposed for detention basin construction and in the areas proposed for access
road, parking lot, and drainage channel construction indicates that intact buried cultural
resources are unlikely to be present due to the some previous disturbance such as creek
channalization and architectural landscaping as well as the presence of soils containing iron
concretions, an indicator that the land is frequently flooded or saturated with water.
During this investigation, the pedestrian survey in conjunction with shovel testing and
mechanical trenching did not result in the identification of any cultural resources. HRA Gray
& Pape recommends that no further archaeological work is required, and that the project be
cleared to proceed as planned.
