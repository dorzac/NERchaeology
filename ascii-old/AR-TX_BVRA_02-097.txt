ABSTRACT
A Phase I archaeological survey of a 75 acre tract in west-central Polk County,
Texas was conducted in January of 2002 by Brazos Valley Research Associates
(BVRA) in Bryan, Texas under Antiquities Permit 2783 issued by the Archeology
Division, Texas Historical Commission. The Principal Investigator was William E.
Moore. No archaeological sites were found to be present within the project area, and it
is recommended that the Onalaska Independent School District be allowed to proceed
with construction as planned. Copies of this report are on file at the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, BVRA, and the
Onalaska Independent School District.

INTRODUCTION
A Phase I archaeological survey of a 75 acre tract in west-central Polk County,
Texas (Figure 1) was conducted on January 16-17, 2002 by BVRA under permit
number 2783 issued by the Archeology Division, THC. The Principal Investigator was
William E. Moore of BVRA who was assisted in the field by James E. Warren (Project
Archaeologist), Art Romine, and Kent Romine. The Onalaska Independent School
District plans to construct a Junior/Senior High School on a portion of the site, with the
rest to be developed at a later date.
Prior to entering the field, a records check was made at TARL in order to identify
all previously recorded sites, if any, in the project area and vicinity. No sites were found
to be present within the project area. However, one prehistoric/historic site was
recorded approximately 1000 meters northwest of the northwest corner of the project
area by BVRA in 1998 (Moore 1998). Based on this records check and personal
experience in the area by the Principal Investigator, the project area appeared to be a
medium to high probability area for the presence of a prehistoric site.
The project area is bounded on the east by Farm-to-Market Road 3459 and on
the north, south, and west by private land (Figure 2). The nearest water source is
Caney Creek that runs in a northeast-southwest direction along the west side of the
project area. The nearest water source is Caney Creek which runs in a northeastsouthwest direction along the west side of the project area and a tributary of this creek
which flows through the northwest corner of the project area as depicted on the
U.S.G.S. topographic quadrangle Onalaska dated 1961 (photorevised 1972) (Figure 3).

FIELD METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a records check was conducted for BVRA by Jean
Hughes, Assistant Curator of Records Research at TARL. Ms Hughes checked the site
files for previously recorded sites in the project area and vicinity. In addition,
information pertaining to previous archaeological work in the region was obtained from
the library at BVRA. The field survey crew relied on the topographic map Onalaska and
the soils book for Polk and San Jacinto counties (McEwen et al. 1988). Due to the
presence of thick woods and secondary yaupon stands throughout the entire 75 acres,
the survey was conducted through shovel testing. Ground surface visibility was rated
by the field crew as zero. All earth excavated through shovel testing was screened
using 1/4" hardware cloth, and a shovel test log (Appendix I) was kept. Profiles of the
shovel tests were sketched in the field, and the tests were drawn on a project area map
(Figure 3). The wooded nature of the project area made it difficult to dig shovel tests at
regular intervals. In all, 36 tests were dug through sandy soils.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The project area is located in a county that contains significant archaeological
sites, both prehistoric and historic. A file search conducted by TARL revealed no
previously recorded sites in the project area. Several sites have been reported south of
the area along Lake Livingston, and one site (41PK122) is approximately 1000 meters
northwest of the northwest corner of the current project area. Site 41PK122 is a very
disturbed multi-component site containing both prehistoric (age not determined) and
historic artifacts (1830-1860) with all artifacts found on the surface. It was determined
to be not significant. No sites in the vicinity are listed in the National Register of Historic
Places 1993 update or as State Archeological Landmarks.
According to a planning document prepared by the Department of Antiquities
Protection (now Archeology Division), the project area is located in the Southeast Texas
Archeological Study Region of the Eastern Planning Region (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:Figure 1.1.2). At the time this document was prepared Polk County contained
0.001 to 0.1 sites per square mile. This is the lowest recorded site density of any
county in Texas except for two counties with no recorded sites.
The three archeological regions in the Eastern Planning Region exhibit greater
internal environmental homogeneity than does the planning region as a whole and is
characterized by considerable cultural diversity, both through time and space
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:13). Early cultures in the region exhibit a greater degree
of similarity in lifeways than was the case for later cultures. These early groups were
probably hunters and gatherers utilizing site areas for brief periods based on the
widespread distribution of point styles, the frequent occurrence of exotic raw materials,
and the meagerness of occupational debris found at excavated campsites (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993:13-14). Through time, group territories appear to have been reduced,
perhaps due to increased population. As territoriality of groups increased, greater
internal diversity is evidenced in the archeological record of the region (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993:14). The diversity in the archeological record becomes quite pronounced
by the Late Prehistoric period, enabling researchers to distinguish the Late Prehistoric
from earlier periods. The discussion above was taken largely from the planning
document by the Department of Antiquities Protection. Interested researchers are
encouraged to consult this comprehensive document for additional background
information regarding the archaeology of Polk County and Southeast Texas.
Much of our current knowledge of the prehistory and history of Polk County has
resulted from cultural resource studies, primarily involving Lake Livingston. The first
major project to involve the reservoir area was the initial survey (Nunley 1963), testing
(McClurkan 1967), and mitigation (McClurkan 1968) of the proposed lake area by the
Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP) in the 1960s. Since that time a number of
small projects have been conducted. Typically, these are small area surveys by private
contractors working with the Corps of Engineers (COE) or in-house projects by COE
staff.

6

Since the TASP investigations in the 1960s, only one major excavation project
has been conducted in the county. The Crawford site (41PK69) was excavated by the
Archeological Research Laboratory, Texas A&M University, under the direction of H.
Blaine Ensor and David L. Carlson (1988) in 1984-1985. Their work provided evidence
that deeply stratified upland sites exist within the region. The Crawford site was
determined to have been inhabited during much of the Holocene as Early, Middle, and
Late Archaic occupations, as well as Early and Late Ceramic Period components, were
defined. The data suggest that the latest deposits are Caddo related, and some
occupational debris may be attributed to the historic Bidai (Ensor and Carlson 1988:iii).
The interested researcher is advised to consult the above-mentioned sources for
previous work in Polk County.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The project area was found to be situated on a sandy hill consisting mainly of
Oakhurst very fine sandy loam, 5 to 8 percent slopes (OaC) as described in the Soil
Survey of Polk and San Jacinto Counties (McEwen et al. 1988:35) and depicted in the
same volume on Sheet 26 (Figure 4). This is a sloping soil on upland side slopes.
Typically this soil has a very fine sandy loam surface layer about 7 inches thick. It is
dark gray in the upper part and gray in the lower part. The subsoil, to a depth of 47
inches, is dark grayish-brown clay in the upper part and gray clay in the lower part. The
underlying material to a depth of about 65 inches is light gray volcanic tuff of silty clay
loam texture. This soil is somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is medium. The available
water capacity is medium, and permeability is very slow. Erosion hazard is severe.
Other soils present, although in very small areas, include Colita Variant-Kitterll complex,
1 to 8 percent slopes (CpC) as described in McEwen et al. (1988:20), Colita-Laska
complex, 1 to 5 percent slopes (ClB) as described in McEwen et al. (1988:20), and
Pinetucky fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (PfB) as described in McEwen et al.
(1988:37-38).
No archaeological sites were found within the 75 acre tract. It is, therefore,
concluded that this was not a suitable setting for a prehistoric site. BVRA recommends
that the Onalaska Independent School District be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned throughout the entire 75 acre tract.
