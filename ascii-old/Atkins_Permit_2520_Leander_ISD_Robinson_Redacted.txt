ABSTRACT
At the request of the Leander Independent School District, PBS&J conducted a cultural
resources survey of a 210-acre (85 hectare) area in Williamson County, Texas, in January 2001. The project
area is proposed for future construction of a middle school, high school, and related sports facilities. One
prehistoric site, 41WM984, was located during this survey. Site 41WM984 is a sparse surface lithic scatter
located on a low limestone hill at the head of a small drainage. No temporally diagnostic artifacts, features, or
discrete artifact concentrations were observed. Site 41WM984 is not thought to be eligible for the National
Register of Historic Places or inclusion as a State Archeological Landmark. No further investigation is
recommended and cultural resources clearance is recommended for the project.

I. INTRODUCTION
In January 2001, PBS&J conducted a cultural resource survey of the proposed Robinson
Properties Development Project (Figure 1) under Antiquities Permit No. 2520. The project area is proposed
for future construction of a middle school, a high school and related sports facilities for the Leander
Independent School District (LISD). The purpose of the investigation was to locate, describe and document,
and assess all existing cultural resources that would be affected by the project. The investigation included a
site records search, a review of historic maps, and an intensive pedestrian survey with limited subsurface
testing of an area of approximately 210 acres (85 hectares [ha]). Rolling, hilly brush land of the Western
Plains characterizes the southwest part of Williamson County. The project area is located on the southern
slope of a east-west trending ridge which forms the divide between Brushy and South Brushy creeks. The
acreage is bounded on three sides by property fences, with the southern side being irregular (Figure 1).
The pedestrian survey was conducted by Russ Shortes and Eric Morley on January 4, 5, and 8,
2001, expending a total of six person days on the field portion of the survey. Work was conducted in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas (Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Natural Resources Code of 1977)
and other appropriate cultural resources legislation and guidelines, as well as the guidelines set forth by the
Register of Professional Archaeologists and the Council of Texas Archeologists (Council of Texas
Archeologists 1992). The report is divided into several sections. Following this introduction is an
environmental background that describes the natural setting of the study area, to include relevant information
on the hydrology, underlying geology, flora and fauna of the area. Details on the research objectives and field
methods are provided in Section III. Previous investigations to place the project within the proper cultural
resource framework and an overview of the regions archeological background is provided in Section IV.
Results of the survey are presented in Section V. Conclusions and recommendations are provided in
Section VI. Lastly, references cited in the text are listed in Section VII. Appendix A (not for public
disclosure) documents the location of the single recorded archaeological site in the project area.

II. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
At the request of LISD, PBS&J conducted an Environmental Inspection (EI) of the Robinson
Property in addition to the current cultural resources survey. The EI included a Phase I Environmental Site
Assessment, Karst Survey, Endangered Species Habitat, and a Wetland Determination. The following
information on the environmental setting is based on the findings and recommendations presented in the
Environmental Inspection Report (McVey 2000), as well as some generalized studies of the central Texas
region in and around Williamson County.
GEOLOGY
Williamson County is bisected by the Balcones escarpment, which forms a line between the
city of Jarrell in the north, through Georgetown, and into Round Rock in the south. This geologic fault zone
demarcates the Western Plains to the west from the Coastal Plains that extend to the gulf in the southeast.
Situated in the southwest part of the county, the blocky, crescent-shaped project area lies among the low,
undulating hills of brush land characteristic of the Western Plains. Elevation ranges between 860 and 900 feet
(262 and 275 meters [m] above mean sea level.
Eckrant-Georgetown soils comprise the gently sloping, dissected uplands north of South
Brushy Creek.

In general, these upland soils are very shallow to moderately deep calcareous, and

noncalcareous, stony, cobbly, and loamy soils formed on indurated fractured limestone (Werchan and Coker
1983). Drainages are composed of Denton silty clay, which forms in the shallow valleys and narrow drainages
in upland areas. The soil is gently sloping (1 to 3 percent slopes) and typically consists of an upper layer of
dark brown silty clay about 33 inches (84 centimeters [cm]) grading to a very pale brown silty clay loam to
36 inches (91 cm). In the northeast corner of the project area are the thin Crawford clays and Georgetown
stony clay loams. Both of these relatively shallow upland soils occur on level upland areas. The Crawford clay
is described as a gently sloping (1 to 3 percent slopes) soil found on mesas, foot slopes, and at the head of
drainageway on uplands. Typically, the upper most layer consist of brown to dark reddish brown clay about 27
inches (69 cm) thick. The Georgetown stony clay loam is described as gently sloping (1 to 3 percent slopes)
soil formed mainly on the higher parts of uplands. The soil is typically slightly acid, brown stony clay loam at
the surface to about 7 inches (18 cm). The subsoil extends to a depth of 35 inches (89 cm) and consists of
reddish brown clay and cobbly clay.
CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGY
The climate of Williamson County is subtropical with a growing season averaging 258 days.
Temperatures in the area range from an average high of 96ï°F in July to an average low of 36ï°F in January.
Rainfall averages 34 inches (86 cm) annually onto well-drained soils, providing a medium amount of runoff
(Ramos 1996). Several shallow ephemeral drainages drain the project area and feed into the stream channel of

440701/010029

South Brushy Creek to the southeast. A small pond is located on level upland in the northeast portion of the
project area, but it is not fed by any drainage.
FLORA
Williamson County is located on the boundary between the Blackland Prairies and Cross
Timbers and Prairies vegetational areas of Texas (Hatch et. al. 1990). The Edwards Plateau vegetational area
borders these two areas on the southwest. The Williamson County region represents an ecotone between these
three vegetational areas. Historically, the climax vegetation of this region consisted of big bluestem
(Andropogon gerardii), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans),
switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), side-oats gramma (Bouteloua curtipendula), and buffalograss (Buchloe
dactyloides). Overgrazing and suppression of naturally occurring wild fires have led to the increase of woody
species such as Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and live oak (Quercus
fusiformis), with an understory composed of saw greenbriar (Smilax bona-nox), fragrant sumac (Rhus
aromatica), and bumelia (Bumelia lanuginosa). Prairie forbs once common in this region included western
ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), gayfeathers (Liatris spp.), bushclover (Lespedeza sp.), and various
sunflowers (Asteraceae); however, croton (Croton spp.), Mexican hat (Ratibida columnaris), and nightshades
(Solanum spp.) have generally increased in abundance in recent times (Gould 1975; Vines 1960).
The project area is predominately composed of upland woodland vegetation with areas of open
grassland located in the west, north-central and northeastern parts of the tract. The most commonly
encountered trees in the upland woodland community are live oak (Quercus fusiformis), Ashe juniper and
cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia). Texas red oak (Quercus buckleyi), post oak (Quercus stellata), and sugar
hackberry (Celtis laevigata) may also occur in this community type. The shrub layer in this community,
though often sparse, may include Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), elbowbush
(Forestiera pubescens), agarito (Berberis trifoliata), fragrant sumac, flameleaf sumac (Rhus lanceolata), and
American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana). Common woody vines of this region include saw greenbriar
(Smilax bona-nox), common greenbriar (Smilax rotundifolia), southern dewberry (Rubus trivialis), Japanese
honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), mustang grape (Vitis mustangensis), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus
cinquefolia), and poison-ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Typical herbaceous species include little bluestem,
panicums (Panicum spp.), Texas winter-grass (Stipa leucotricha), Mexican hat, and pricklypear (Opuntia
lindheimeri), among others (Vines 1960). Common grasses of these communities include little bluestem, silver
bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), King Ranch bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum), switchgrass (Panicum
virgatum), johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense), bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon), brome grasses (Bromus
spp.), dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum), and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), among others. Typical forb
species include Mexican hat, Indian blanket (Gaillardia pulchella), Dakota verbena (Verbena bipinnatifida),
Texas dandelion (Pyrrhopappus multicaulis), lemon beebalm (Monarda citriodora), plantain (Plantago sp.),
evening primrose (Oenothera speciosa), and goldenrods (Solidago spp.), among others. Brush species such as

eastern baccharis (Baccharis halimifolia), Texas persimmon, Ashe juniper, tickle-tongue (Zanthoxylum
hirsutum), agarito, and pricklypear also occur in unimproved grasslands. (Gould 1975; Vines 1960).
FAUNA
Williamson County lies at the interface of the Texan and Balconian biotic provinces as
described by Blair (1950). The fauna of the project area is representative of the ecotone between these two
provinces, with many species reaching their respective eastern or western distribution limits in this area.
Wildlife habitat types closely coincide with the upland woodlands and grassland vegetational communities
described above.
The upland woods within the project area are typical live oak-Ashe juniper woodlands.
Characteristic woodland fauna include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginanus), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus
floridanus), common raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), and avian species such as the
Carolina chickadee (Pachouli carolinensis), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), western scrub jay
(Aphelocoma coerulescens), ladder-backed woodpecker (Picoides scalaris), and mourning dove (Zenaida
macroura).

Common herpetofaun include the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), Texas spiny lizard

(Scleoporus olivaceus), ground skink (Scincella lateralis), and broad-banded copperhead (Agkistrodon
contortrix laticinctus) (Davis and Schmidly 1994; Dickinson 1999; Dixon 2000).
Grassland habitats within the project area may support faunal species common to the region.
Mammalian species characteristic of this habitat type include the eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus),
hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), and the nine-banded
armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus). Common birds include the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus),
eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), and killdeer (Charadrius
vociferus). Herpetofauna (amphibians and reptiles) typical of this habitat include the six-lined racerunner
(Cnemidophorous sexlineatus), Texas rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta lindheimerii), and the Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps) (Davis and Schmidly 1994; Dickinson 1999; Dixon 2000).

III. RESEARCH DESIGN
The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National Park Service
criteria (35 CFR, Part 60.4) which present the guidelines for determining eligibility of a cultural resource for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The objectives of the program were: 1) to
locate any archaeological resources within the area of potential effect from the proposed construction; 2) to
assess their potential for NRHP eligibility or official designation as a State Archaeological Landmark (SAL); 3)
to assess the effect of the proposed construction on located resources; and 4) to provide resource specific
recommendations for mitigation of adverse impact to significant properties.
On January 3, 2001, PBS&J conducted a records search at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) and the Texas Historical Commission for the identification of previous cultural resource
investigations and previously recorded sites, including sites listed or eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or
designated as SALs. Historic maps available at the Texas State Library dating to 1893 and 1936 were also
reviewed.
Typical Central Texas sites are generally composed of accumulations of chipped stone, burned
rock, and utilitarian objects that are the residue of prehistoric occupations. In areas with shallow soils,
evidence of prehistoric inhabitants is often visible on the surface. On January 4, 5, and 8, 2001, PBS&J
conducted a 100-percent survey of the project area utilizing parallel pedestrian transects spaced approximately
30 m apart. Visual inspection of the ground surface was augmented by shovel tests placed judgmentally
throughout the project area, concentrated primarily in areas where surface visibility was limited. Each shovel
test was excavated in 10-cm levels to a depth when clearly sterile substrates were encountered.

IV. CULTURAL BACKGROUND
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The Brushy Creek watershed has long been noted for its archaeological resources. Between
1918 and 1930, J.E. Pearce and Roy Bedichek conducted excavations along Brushy Creek and its tributaries
including the Walsh estate site (41WM11), a group of four burned rock middens on Lake Creek south of
Round Rock (Pearce 1938:3-11, 25-30). In 1959, nine burned rock middens were identified northeast of the
project area on Chandler Branch at the Dedear Site (identified by two trinomials: 41WM15 and 41WM239).
Limited salvage excavations were conducted on one of the middens at the Dedear Site in 1964 by the Travis
County Archeological Society (TARL files).
In 1981, the Texas Department of Water Resources (TDWR) conducted a cultural resources
survey along Brushy Creek east of the project area. They identified and recorded ten archaeological sites
(41WM12 and 41WM462-41WM470) representing both prehistoric and historic period occupations. Sites
41WM12, 41WM463, 41WM467 and 41WM468 were recommended for testing to determine significance and
41WM465 (Kenney's Fort) was considered to be archeologically significant and potentially eligible for
nomination to the NRHP (Fox et al. 1981).
During a cultural resources survey in preparation of an extension of Farm-to-Market
Road 1431, three sites were encountered along Brushy and Spanish Oak creeks about 1.5 kilometers (km)
north of the project area. One of these sites, the Wilson Leonard Site (41WM235) has subsequently been
excavated and contains the most complete temporal sequence of prehistoric archeological assemblages from a
single site in Central Texas (Masson and Collins 1995, Collins 1998).
In the South Brushy Creek drainage south of the project area, three archaeological
reconnaissance surveys were conducted by the TDWR.

The surveys were for proposed wastewater

improvements and totaled 365 ha. Conducted in 1980, 1981 and 1984, the surveys resulted in the location of
19 cultural resources sites: 41WM439-41WM441; 41WM444-41WM456; and 41WM543-41WM545,
respectively, including 15 prehistoric sites and four multicomponent historic/prehistoric period sites.
Additional testing to determine possible significance for NRHP eligibility was recommended for eight sites:
41WM439, 41WM446, 41WM447, 41WM451, and 41WM453-41WM456 (Whitsett 1981).
In 1984, Prewitt and Associates conducted a survey known as the Ideal Basic Tract, which
encompassed a broad transect running north to south from South Brushy Creek across adjacent lowlands and
into the uplands. Three sites were recorded, including sites 41WM653 and 41WM654, that are in proximity to
the present project area. None of these sites were recommended for further investigation (Coffman et al.
1985).

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
Native Americans have occupied Central Texas for more than 11,000 years. What is known of
these early inhabitants is based on a continually evolving assessment of the archeological record. Foremost in
the quest for understanding is the effort put into developing a chronology. The diverse environmental setting
and the multitude of cultures, which occupied this area in the past, makes the establishment of definite period
indicators difficult. This is compounded when sites possess few diagnostic tools or multiple occupations are
intermixed. Following is an overview of the nearly complete continuum of habitation for the Central Texas
area. Because of the fluid nature of any regional chronology, and because the results of the present
investigation do not contribute any significant detail to the development of the chronology, the archeological
background is general and reflects only those time period divisions that have traditionally have been used for
Central Texas.
Traditionally, the prehistoric cultural sequence is divided into several sections based on
observed differences in tools or site patterns. These stages are the Paleo-Indian stage, Archaic stage, Late
Prehistoric stage, and Historic stage.
The Paleo-Indian stage (pre-10,000 to ca. 6500 B.C.) is the earliest known prehistoric cultural
sequence in the Central Texas archaeological area. Traditionally, this stage has been characterized by highly
mobile bands of people that relied heavily on big game hunting of Pleistocene megafauna. However, the
paucity of Paloeo-Indian sites containing megafaunal remains (such as Bison antiquus) combined with the data
collected over the past few decades of central Texas archeology indicate that the traditional view is
oversimplified. In Central Texas, Paleo-Indian sites commonly occur as small, dispersed lithic scatters, usually
located in upland areas near drainages. Such sites are thought to represent temporary campsites, resource
procurement loci, or tool making stations of small groups of people. Projectile points such as the Clovis,
Folsom and Plainview points are characteristic of this stage and are distinguished by their lanceolate shape and
basil fluting.
A diversification in subsistence strategies is present in the archeological record, marking the
beginning of the Archaic stage (6500 B.C. to A.D. 700). This long period of time represents a successful
adaptive strategy of prehistoric inhabitants who began exploiting a wider variety of small game in addition to
foraging for edible plants. Projectile point types representative of the Early Archaic period include Wells,
Gower, Bandy, Martindale, and Tortugas. These diverse projectile point types are indicators that different
cultural groups were developing around 5000 B.C. The presence of large scatters of burned rock, a bi-product
of starchy food processing, is common to the earlier part of this stage. Later settlements continued to occupy
terrace locations, and rock shelters became increasingly utilized. Point types such as Darl, Ensor, and Frio are
characteristic of the Late Archaic.

440701/010029

In Central Texas, the Late Prehistoric stage (A.D. 700 to European Contact) is a continuation
of mobile hunting and gathering sustenance strategies of previous stages. Small projectile points associated
with the advent of bow-and-arrow technology make an appearance in the archeological record, as do ceramics
and agriculture, brought about by more sedentary settlement patterns. The Late Prehistoric stage is represented
by the Austin and Toyah phases. The Austin phase (ca. A.D. 700-1300) is characterized by expandingstemmed and small subtriangular points (such as Scallorn and Granbury), serrated flakes, and Friday-type
bifaces. Diagnostic artifacts of the later Toyah phase (ca. A.D. 1300-1750) include small pointed-stemmed
points (Perdiz and Clifton), Covington-type knives, drills, and tools made from bison bone. The latter part of
this stage is evidenced by the appearance of limited ceramic usage and cemeteries. Ceramics associated with
this stage are of the bone-tempered Leon Plain type.
During the early portion of the Historic stage (time of European contact to present), at the time
of initial European contact and settlement, Central Texas was inhabited by numerous aboriginal groups
including the Jumano, Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche (Newcomb 1961). Native tribes of the eastern
United States were displaced from their traditional homelands by the westward spread of Anglo-American and
European groups in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and immigrant Indian tribes, such as the Delaware,
moved to Central Texas. Trade items such as glass beads, European-made ceramics, gun parts and metal
projectile points are indicative of a contact-period occupation, although such sites are relatively rare.
Ultimately, the hostility of Apache and Comanche tribes who frequented Central Texas forced
the abandonment of most Spanish missions in Texas. Following Mexico's defeat of the Spanish Empire in
1821, these tribes still maintained a presence in the area. No permanent settlement north of San Antonio was
attempted until 1805 when the Spanish established a garrison at the road ford of the Colorado River at the
present location of the city of Bastrop. In the Republic period (1836-1845), the earliest land grants issued in
what would become Williamson County were typically issued to men who had participated in the war for
independence from Mexico. Early Anglo settlement in Williamson County tended to be from the southern
states of the United States, primarily from Tennessee and Arkansas. Shortly after the formation of Williamson
County in 1848, the small settlement of Brushy was selected to be the county seat. Cedar Park, originally
named Running Brushy, began as a settlement in the early 1870s. In 1882 the Austin and Northwestern
Railroad was completed from Austin to Burnet, and crossed through the settlement. At this time the railroad
company changed the name of the community to Brueggerhoff, and by 1887 the town was renamed Cedar
Park, after its park-like surroundings (Wynn 1997).

V. RESULTS
The records search revealed a cluster of previously recorded prehistoric sites along Brushy
Creek and Spanish Oak Creek to the north of the project area and South Brushy Creek to the south of the
project area.
Eighteen previously recorded sites are located within 1 km of the project area although none
have been recorded within the project area prior to the present survey.
A review of the 1893 U.S. Geological Survey Georgetown 30-minute Quadrangle shows the
town of Cedar Park about 2 km to the west, but no roads or developed areas in the project vicinity. The 1936
Williamson County Road Map shows a road at the southern edge of the project area along the route of present
Brushy Creek Road, but no residences within 500 m of the project area.
Topographically, the project area is situated on the southern slope of a east-west trending ridge
which forms the divide between Brushy and South Brushy creeks. The slope of the project area is gentle to
moderate and generally to the south-southeast. Two shallow ephemeral tributaries of South Brushy Creek that
transect the project area are the nearest possible sources of surface water. South Brushy Creek, a large seasonal
stream is located about 450 m south of the project area at its nearest point.
Vegetation of the project area consisted primarily of juniper and live oak trees with sparse
grasses and other shrubby vegetation. Surface visibility of the project area ranged from about 20 to 70 percent,
averaging about 40 percent. During the current survey effort, approximately 20 shovel tests were excavated
(Figure 1). All of the tests exhibited a dark brown clay loam surface soil with sparse to dense limestone gravel
and cobbles intermixed. Shovel tests were terminated within 10 cm because the shallow, upland residual soils
were judged to lack potential to contain buried deposits.
During the survey, several areas of modern dumping were encountered as well as a wire
livestock pen. Very sparsely scattered chipping debris was observed on the ground surface throughout the
project area. No artifacts were encountered in any of the shovel tests. One cultural resources site, 41WM984,
was recorded.
Site 41WM984 is a sparse surface lithic scatter located on a low limestone hill overlooking the
head of a small ephemeral drainage about 1 km north of South Brushy Creek (Appendix Figure 1). The site
measures about 25 m north-south by 40 m east-west. Observed surface remains include about 50 lithic
debitage fragments and two bifacial tools distributed randomly over the site area. No temporally diagnostic
artifacts were observed. No evidence of features, discrete artifact concentrations or other types of cultural
remains were observed.

440701/010029

10

The soil of the site location has been mapped as Eckrant cobbley clay: a shallow, calcareous
clay common to uplands in the region. The potential for buried cultural remains was investigated by a single
shovel test placed in the approximate middle of the site. The test yielded a compact, very gravelly clay loam to
a depth of about 10 cm and was culturally negative. Vegetation over the site area consisted primarily of sparse
bunch grasses with scattered junipers and live oak trees. Surface visibility was about 40 percent over most of
the site.
Site 41WM984 represents a low intensity prehistoric occupation of the location. It may
represent a short-term campsite or resource procurement locale. Similar sites have been recorded in the Brushy
Creek, Spanish Oak Creek, and South Brushy Creek watersheds, although they are not numerous. These sites
(41WM944, 41WM774, 41WM775, and 41WM939) are located on eroded upland hill-slopes above drainages
in a setting similar to that of 41WM984. They are composed of lithic scatters that lack diagnostic points,
features, or deposits of significant depth. Most of the previously recorded sites located in these watersheds
occupy a position on the floodplain or in close proximity to tributary drainages. Common to these locations is
that their respective positions on the landscape are largely depositional and at relatively lower elevations.
During the survey, no elements were observed which could contribute to a recommendation of
NRHP eligibility or listing as a SAL. Due to the paucity of remains, absence of intact features or deposits and
a lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, it is doubtful that further, more intensive investigation will yield any
significant amount of information. Therefore, no further investigation is recommended.

440701/010029

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The pedestrian survey of the proposed development area located one cultural resource site,
41WM984, which is not thought to be eligible for the NRHP or inclusion as a SAL. Site 41WM984 represents
a low intensity prehistoric occupation that may be a short-term campsite or resource procurement locale. Due
to the large degree of surface visibility and the shallow upland soils which dominate the project area, the
likelihood of significant unlocated cultural resources eligible for the NRHP or official designation as a SAL
within the project area is thought to be minimal. No further investigation or special precautions are thought to
be necessary and cultural resource clearance is recommended for this project.
If, during construction and maintenance, previously unrecorded cultural resources are
encountered, the State Historic Preservation Officer should be contacted to assess the remains and provide
recommendations as to how to deal with the site under the stateâs historic preservation plan.
