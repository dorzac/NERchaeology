ABSTRACT
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, was contracted to conduct a cultural resources
investigation consisting of background and site file research, historic maps and aerial imagery
review, and an intensive archaeological survey of a 166-hectare (410-acre) tract for BergOliver Associates, Inc. The Lead Federal Agency for this project has been identified as the
United States Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District. The project is being conducted in
order to comply with United States Army Corps of Engineers Nationwide Permit 14 to fulfill
the requirements set forth by 36 CFR Part 800 of the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966, as amended, and therefore evidence of review of the report of investigations by the
Texas State Historic Preservation Office will be presented to the United States Army Corps of
Engineers upon their request. Because the subject property consists of entirely privately
owned land, a Texas Antiquities Permit was not obtained.
The historic maps and aerial imagery review and background and site file research were
initiated prior to fieldwork mobilization. The file search included a review of both
archeological site files and historic resource files, and a review of previously conducted
cultural resource surveys in the vicinity. As part of the site file search, HRA Gray & Pape, LLC
attempted to document previously identified resources located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile)
radius of the Area of Potential Effects. In addition, a review of topographic maps and aerial
imagery of the Area of Potential Effects were also conducted prior to the fieldwork in an
attempt to identify structures on the property and disturbances to soils, and to review recent
and historic landuse.
Archaeological survey methods utilized during the intensive pedestrian investigations consisted
of shovel test placement along parallel transects. Intensive pedestrian survey results were used
to assess the potential impact that construction activities might have on cultural resources
located within the Area of Potential Effects. The Area of Potential Effects is defined as the
entire 166-hectare (410-acre) tract to a maximum depth of 2 meters (7 feet). The intensive
pedestrian survey covered 100% of the parcel employing 100-meter (328-foot) transect
spacing. The entirety of the Area of Potential Effects was surveyed and a total of 128 shovel
tests were excavated during the pedestrian survey. The bulldozed remains of an historic-aged
house site were found during the survey in the northeast corner of the Area of Potential
Effects. A trinomial was not sought and the site is not recommended as eligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places. A complex of 8 standing structures was recorded in
the southeast corner of the Area of Potential Effects. An interview with the former property
owner Charles Cashdollar provided approximate dates of construction and revealed that all the
structures were built by and for the Cashdollar family. One house was built in the 1930s by
Charles Cashdollar’s grandfather and moved to the property in the early 1960s. This structure
is in a state of dilapidation. The remaining structures were built in the 1950s and 1960s or
moved to their present location in the late 1960s or later (Chuck Cashdollar, personal
communication 2011). All of the structures are of common design and construction.
Trinomials were not sought for any of the structures and none are recommended eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places. HRA Gray & Pape, LLC recommends that
no further cultural resource work be required and that the project be cleared to proceed as
planned

1.0 INTRODUCTION
HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), of Houston, Texas, was contracted to conduct a
cultural resources investigation consisting of background and site file research, historic maps and
aerial imagery review, and an intensive archaeological survey of a 166-hectare (410-acre) tract
for Berg Oliver Associates, Inc. The Lead Federal Agency for this project has been identified as
the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Galveston District and SWG-2011-01053
has been assigned to the undertaking. The project is being conducted in order to comply with the
USACE Nationwide Permit 14 to fulfill the requirements set forth by 36 CFR Part 800 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended, and therefore evidence of
review of the report of investigations by the Texas State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO)
will be presented to the USACE upon their request. Because the subject property consists of
entirely privately owned land, a Texas Antiquities Permit was not obtained.
The goals of the investigation were to determine if project construction would affect any
previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as
amended (36 CFR 800) or State Archaeological Landmarks (SALs), and to establish whether or
not previously unidentified cultural resources were located within the Area of Potential Effects
(APE). All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to State laws and
guidelines (the Antiquities Code of Texas). Survey and site identification followed Texas
Antiquities Code (TAC) standards provided in 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.5 (35), 13 TAC
26.20(1), and 13 TAC 26.20(2). This report follows accepted standards set forth by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA).

1.1

Project Description

The APE falls within the Spring, TX United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
quadrangle map (#3095-122). The APE coincides with the USACE jurisdictional area (Figure 1).
The APE is a 166-hectare (410-acre) tract proposed for the construction of residential buildings
and associated infrastructure. The eastern boundary of the tract is at the outside (western) edge of
the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) right-of-way (ROW) of Interstate 45 and does
not include property owned or controlled by TxDOT. The southeastern boundary of the APE
follows the approximate route of an existing pipeline corridor. The southwestern boundary of the
APE lies approximately 150 meters (490 feet) north of railroad tracks and an overhead electric
utility corridor. The northern boundary is marked by a newly constructed gravel road which was
the subject of an earlier survey performed by HRA Gray & Pape. The western boundary of the
APE also overlaps an area previously surveyed by HRA Gray & Pape. Impacts from the project
will vary but are not expected to exceed 2 meters (7 feet).

2.0 NATURAL SETTING
2.1

Surface Geology and Geomorphology

The Texas Coastal Plain makes up part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain. The Gulf Coastal Plain is
a level to gently sloping region extending from Florida to Mexico. The Texas Coastal Plain
reaches as far north as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma and as far west as the Balcones
escarpment in central Texas. The basic geomorphic characteristics of the Texas coast and
associated inland areas, which includes Harris County, resulted from depositional conditions
influenced by the combined action of sea level changes from glacial advance in the northern
portions of the continent and subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load
capacity of the region’s rivers. Locally, Harris County is underlain by relatively recent
sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Miocene to Holocene
(Abbott 2001; Van Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott 2001; Aronow
1992; Barnes 1982; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term human occupation
in modern-day Harris County include the Willis, Lissie (also called Montgomery) and Beaumont
formations, and younger late Pleistocene to early Holocene units such as the so-called
“Deweyville” terraces, positioned stratigraphically between the Beaumont and Recent deposits,
and Recent deposits. Quaternary alluvium of primarily Pleistocene age sediment underlies and
surrounds Spring Creek which forms the northern boundary of the APE. Panther Branch joins
Spring Creek along the northern boundary of the APE. Quaternary Lissie Formation underlies
this alluvium and the remainder of the APE (Barnes 1982). These deposits are made up of clay,
silt, and sand. Some smaller gravels and concretions composed of iron-oxides, iron-manganese
oxides and calcium carbonate occur in the upper part. The lower part is noncalcareous but iron
oxide concretions are more common and gravels tend to be slightly larger. The surface is gently
rolling (Barnes 1982). Saul Aronow (1992) provided some distinguishing characteristics of the
Lissie surface that help archaeologists and geologists recognize it in the field. He notes:
“The commonest surface signature of the Lissie are circular to elliptical undrained
depressions and pimple mounds … both of which are, at least in part, eolian in
origin. Vertisols are rare on the Lissie surface, though potential "fat" or plastic
clays are abundant in the subsurface (Aronow 1992:5).”
The date of deposition for the Deweyville Terraces is unknown. However, Abbott (2001:16)
among others believes the north-south oriented terraces aggraded during the Late Pleistocene
from overbank deposition of Rivers and streams including the ancient Brazos River prior to the
beginning of the Holocene. Abbott suggests that aggradation ended by about 20,000 Before
Present (B.P.) (Abbott 2001:106). However, meanders of rivers, including the Brazos, cut valleys
through these terraces regularly during the Holocene and then abandoned them. This process
leaves a large, flat, open, and well drained area favored for campsites. While all depositional
facies other than channels have the potential to preserve archaeological sites, behaviorally,
human activity favors well drained, sandy channel-proximal localities over floodbasin muds
(Abbott 2001:126). Other Recent or Holocene deposits on the Gulf Plain typically result from
overbank flooding of extant streams, eolian transport including dune formation, and infilling of
4

marshes. Quaternary alluvium underlies Spring Creek and its floodplain which extends 75 to 400
meters (246 to 1312 feet) south of the channel in the APE. The middle Pleistocene Lissie
formation underlies Quaternary Alluvium of Spring Creek and immediately underlies the
remainder of the APE (USGS 2010). Detailed soils maps show Nahatche and Ozan soils have
formed on the southern side of Spring Creek within the APE. These soils formed in recent
alluvium (Abbott 2001).

2.2

Physiography

The APE falls within the Western Gulf subdivision of the Atlantic and Gulf Coast physiographic
province (Aronow 1992). Spring Creek runs 0.5 to 1.3 km (0.3 to 0.8 miles) north of the APE.
This is a high order stream formed on an inactive fault line. Holocene deposits associated with
this stream likely occur well north of the APE.

2.3

Soils

The majority of sediments within the tract of land have been mapped as Wockley fine sandy
loam soil. Smaller amounts of Segno fine sandy loam (0 to 1% slopes and 1 to 3 % slopes) are
located in the northern portion of the APE. Gessner loam is mapped in the lower wetland
depressions in the southwestern portion of the APE.
Wockley series soils are the most common in the APE. This soil series forms in late Pliocene to
early Pleistocene fluviomarine deposits. Similar to the Segno series these soils are believed to
have the potential to bury archaeological sites through colluvial, eolian, overland-flow, and
bioturbation (Aronow 1992). Abbott (2001) categorizes these soils as having a low
geoarchaeological potential. This series typically has an A horizon of grayish brown fine sandy
loam. The E horizon below that is brown fine sandy loam. The next layer is a Btc horizon of
brown sandy clay loam mottled with yellowish brown, red, and light brownish gray. Below that
is a Btvc horizon of light brownish gray sandy clay loam mottled with light gray, red, and
yellowish brown. A second Btvc horizon is frequently found (Wheeler 1976).
Segno series soils cover the second largest area within the APE behind the Wockley series.
These soils formed in early Pleistocene loamy fluviomarine deposits. According to Aronow
(1992), these soils” should be capable of site formation either by colluvial, overland-flow or
eolian burial, or bioturbation.” This soil series forms in wooded parts of the Lissie formation on
hills or uplands. Abbott (2001) classifies this series in his low geoarchaeological potential soils
group. Segno fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 % slopes, has a dark grayish brown fine sandy loam surface
layer. The next layer is pale brown fine sandy loam. The layer below that is a yellowish brown
sandy clay loam mottled with brownish yellow and red at a depth of 61 centimeters (23 inches).
The last layer has gray mottles (Wheeler 1976). Segno fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 % slopes, has a
surface layer of dark grayish brown fine sandy loam. The next layer is pale brown fine sandy
loam. The layer below that is yellowish brown sandy clay loam. The next layer is sandy clay
loam with brownish yellow and red mottling. The last layer is mottled with gray (Wheeler 1976).
Gessner loam soil occupies some of the small depressions in the project area. It is a deep, poorly
drained, very slowly permeable soil derived from Pleistocene-age Lissie Formation sediments. In

5

most years, these soils pond water from November through May. Abbott (2001) classifies this
series in his low to moderate geoarchaeological potential soils group. A typical profile of
Gessner loam consists of 18 centimeters (7 inches) of dark grayish brown, friable, slightly acidic
fine sandy loam, followed by 23 centimeters (9 inches) of grayish brown, friable, slightly acidic
fine sandy loam. The third layer extends 46 centimeters (18 inches) and is a brownish gray,
friable, moderately alkaline fine sandy loam, followed by 79 centimeters (31 inches) of light
gray, friable, moderately alkaline sandy clay loam (Wheeler 1976).
2.3.1 Flora and Fauna
Harris County lies within the Austroriparian biotic province as defined by Blair (1950). Native
vegetation specific to the region occurs near the current APE. The APE is situated in the Upland
Prairies and Woods subregion of the Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes Region (Abbott 2001).
Evidence from pollen analysis in Central Texas suggests that the area may have been populated
by vegetation that was tolerant of a cold weather environment during the Late Pleistocene.
Climatic fluctuation during the Holocene eventually resulted in a gradual trend to the current
weather regime (Abbott 2001).
Late Pleistocene flora may have included populations of spruce, poplar, maple, and pine
(Holloway 1997), in an oak woodland environment that would eventually transition to an oak
savanna in the late Holocene (Abbott 2001). Fauna during this time would include currently
present species such as white-tailed deer and various smaller game, as well as bison, and, in
localized areas, pronghorn sheep, and the American alligator (Abbott 2001).
The modern vegetative community associated with this region consists of a diverse collection of
primarily deciduous trees and undergrowth (Abbott 2001). Modern land alteration activities,
especially those associated with agriculture, have resulted in the removal of native plant species
from the area. Identified trees may include water oak, pecan, various elms, cedar, oaks,
sweetgum, and mulberry, to name a few. Honeysuckle, dewberry, yaupon, and blackberry are
common, as are indiangrass and bluegrasses (Abbott 2001).
The modern faunal community includes mammals such as deer, squirrel, raccoon, skunk,
numerous bird species, and reptiles including the Texas rat snake, the western cottonmouth, and
turtle species. Black bear and bison were present occasionally in the past (Abbott 2001).
2.3.2 Climate
Harris County’s close proximity to the Gulf of Mexico influences temperature, rainfall, and
relative humidity of the region. Winds usually trend from the southeast or east, except during
winter months when high-pressure systems can bring in polar air from the north. Average
temperatures in the summer can reach well into the 90s (degrees Fahrenheit), and are often
accompanied by high humidity. Although winter temperatures can reach into the low 30s
(degrees Fahrenheit), below freezing temperatures usually occur on only a few days out of every
year, and are typically restricted to the early morning hours.

6

Rainfall is even throughout the year, with an average monthly distribution ranging from between
43 centimeters (17 inches) to trace amounts; rainfall comes primarily from thunderstorms, which
tend to be heavy but of short duration (Wheeler 1976).

2.4

Land Use

Previous land uses include oil drilling, tree farming, cattle grazing and possibly other agriculture
activities. Several historical aerial photographs and topographic maps were examined to find
evidence of structures and land use in the APE (NAIP 2009, USGS 1995, TxDOT 1989, TxDOT
1979, ASCS 1964, USGS 1957, ASCS 1938, USGS, 1982, 1960, 1942, and 1920). The APE
includes the southern portion of the Kuhlman oil fields. The oil fields first appear on a USGS
(1957) aerial photograph and a 1960 (USGS) topographic map and are absent on the 1938
(ASCS) aerial and the 1942 (USGS) topographic map of the Spring quadrant. The oil field
consists of drilling pads and roads connecting them. Also likely associated with drilling
operations is the bermed detention basin located during survey in the northern central portion of
the APE. It first appears on the 1957 aerial photograph. The forest was cleared in the areas
around these oil operations. Informant Charles Cashdollar lived on the property his entire life.
His family lived on the property since at least the 1930s and Mr. Cashdollar knew the history of
the property from that time. During the period of time that the property was part of the Kuhlman
oil fields, cattle also grazed on the undeveloped parts. Mr. Cashdollar is unaware of any
constructions on the land previous to its use as an oilfield. The oilfield ran dry in the 1960s
according to Mr. Cashdollar (Charles Cashdollar, personal communication 2011). No structures
are noted within the APE on the 1942 topographic map. The earliest record of structures within
the APE is on the topographic map from 1960 which shows 3 buildings in the southeast corner of
the APE and 2 in the northeast corner. The 2 structures visible in the northeast corner of the APE
may be the same ones that were found as bulldozed remains during the present survey. A stand
of residential and commercial buildings still occupy the southeastern corner of the APE.

3.0 CULTURAL SETTING
The culture history context is intended to aid in the evaluation of a resource’s eligibility for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) by providing a framework within
which to evaluate the resource.
The prehistoric context of the area is best understood by starting with Aten (1983) and Patterson
(1996) treatises on the prehistory of southeast Texas. Prior to colonization of the region, it was
occupied by Karankawa Indians. Dr. Robert Ricklis (1996) points out that there were 5 different
subgroups of Kawakawa Indians documented in historical records. These groups moved closer to
the coast to avoid Europeans. The Karankawas welcomed interior Indian tribes when their
population dropped to near 1,800. Archaeological evidence has encountered numerous sites in
the area consisting of shell middens and campsite refuse of these merged tribes.
Most sites near the coast between the Brazos River and Sabine Lake consist of middens of clams
found in estuaries or exposed in cutbanks along streams (Aten 1983; Patterson 1985). These
middens usually contain faunal material as well as cultural remains such as lithic tools and
pottery. Inland sites are less likely to consist of middens and are more similar to generalized
open campsites. In both areas, sites are found near stream channels.
Addicks Reservoir was one of the largest and earliest projects conducted in the area (Wheat
1953). This project is located outside of the 1.6 kilometer (1-mile) study area but is important to
any study of the area. The research done during that project initialized the formation of the
Galveston Bay Focus and the development of a cultural sequence of the region based on lithics
and ceramics (Aten 1983). Aten (1983) and Story (1990) have aptly described the cultural
context of the upper coastal region. This information is merged with the archaeological data here
to give a complete picture of life on the Upper Texas Coast.
The historic period began in the sixteenth century with the first Spanish coastline explorations. It
was during this period that the 1527 to 1528 expedition fleet of Panfilo de Narvaez’s was caught
in a storm, leaving Cabeza de Vaca and a small group of castaways marooned on the Isle of
Misfortune, an unspecified island near Galveston, in 1528. The group provided the first
ethnohistorical accounts of the region’s inhabitants.

3.1

Prehistoric Cultural Periods

3.1.1 Paleoindian Period
Along the Upper Texas Coast, the Paleoindian period begins around 12,000 B.P. and ends near
9,000 B.P. (Aten 1983; Story 1990). This period is poorly represented in the archaeological
evidence for the region (Aten 1983) and no sites for this period have been verified. Isolated
artifacts include Clovis, Angostura, Scottsbluff, Meserve, Plainview, and Golondrina point types
(Aten 1983). Sites from this stage would be either buried by alluvium or found in upland sites.

8

The Transitional Archaic period begins about 9,000 B.P. and ends around 7,500 B.P. (Aten 1983;
Story 1990). This stage is also poorly represented in the archaeological work in the area but
isolated finds of Bell/Calf Creek, Early-Side Notched, and Early Expanding Stemmed dart points
are attributed to this time period.
3.1.2 Archaic Period
The Archaic stage is thought to include a shift towards a diet more geared towards plant
processing but is still a broad-based diet. Plant processing technology seen during the entire
Archaic period includes stone-lined hearths and baking pits as well as milling tools (Story 1990).
Groups began to travel over less of the landscape and population density seems to have risen.
Beginning at 7,500 B.P. and spanning 2,500 years (Aten 1983), the Early Archaic period in this
region has not been well documented. The sites may have been destroyed or deeply buried (Aten
1983; Story 1990). In situ, Early Archaic remains have been found at the Addicks Reservoir as
well as other localities in the area (Story 1990). Points from this period include Bell, Carrollton,
Trinity, Wells, and Early Stemmed. It is possible that the Carrollton, Trinity, and Wells points
continued to be used into the middle Archaic (Patterson 1996).
The Middle Archaic period (5,000 to 3,000 B.P.) is represented by the earliest surviving shell
middens (Aten 1983). These middens often contain remains of shellfish, such as oysters and
estuarine clams, faunal material from terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, and the earliest known
human burials in the region (Aten 1983). Characteristic projectile points include Bulverde,
Williams, Lange, and Pedernales types.
The Late Archaic lasted from 3,000 to 2,000 B.P. and shows evidence for population increase
(Aten 1983). By 2,500 B.P., the climate in this area was essentially like the modern climate.
Ground stone artifacts made from materials from southwestern Arkansas and found in context
with human burials in cemeteries such as the Ernest Witte Site indicate the possibility of trade
(Hall 1981). Projectile points differ from earlier periods in that they are corner-notched or
expanding-stemmed forms, such as the Kent, Ellis, and Pontchartrain types. Other types can be
found, such as the un-notched Pamillas. These types are thought to precede the Gary type, which
can be found into the Late Prehistoric (Story 1990). During the Late Archaic, more utilitarian
biface tools are prevalent as well as are bone tools. Late Archaic assemblages are very similar to
the early part of the Late Prehistoric stage (Aten 1983).
3.1.3 Late Prehistoric Period
The transition from the Late Archaic stage to the Late Prehistoric is indicated by the introduction
of ceramics into the assemblage (Aten 1983). Cultural shifts during the Late Prehistoric include
the possible adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle and major technological changes, such as
sandy paste ceramics and late in the stage, the bow and arrow (Story 1990). The cultural tradition
during the Late Prehistoric along the Upper Gulf Coast has been designated as Woodland. Story
(1990) has suggested the use of the term Mossy Grove Tradition to define cultural patterns of the
region. The Trinity River seems to be a dividing line in this tradition with cultures east of the
river being more similar to those in Louisiana than to those to the west of Galveston Bay. The

9

eastern tradition also seems to have begun earlier than that in the west, beginning about 2,000
B.P. and lasting 600 years (Aten 1983; Story 1990).
Story (1990) splits the Mossy Grove Tradition into 5 distinct time intervals on the coast, while
noting that only 2 are found inland. Aten (1983) defined these intervals for the area between the
Brazos River and Galveston Bay as the Clear Lake (1850-1525 B.P.), Mayes Island (1525-1300
B.P.), Turtle Bay (1300-950 B.P.), Round Lake (950-600 B.P.), and Old River (600-250 B.P.)
periods based on ceramic styles. Only the Round Lake period is recognized by Aten (1983) for
the West Bay-Brazos Delta due to the low artifact class diversity compared to areas east of
Galveston Bay as well as a time discrepancy in which equivalent periods are later in time than
those to the east.
Early ceramics from this area are similar to Tchefuncte period wares found near Sabine Lake and
into Louisiana and include sandy paste varieties such as Mandeville Plain, Goose Creek Plain
(Anahuac variety), and Tchefuncte Plain (Aten 1983; Story 1990). These early sites appear
similar to pre-ceramic sites due to the low number of ceramic sherds found. The appearance of
sandy paste and sand-tempering occurs about 1900 B.P. with the O’Neal Plain (variety Conway)
being a good example (Aten 1983). Rocker-stamped decorations, a distinctive marker for this
period, are uncommon in the West Bay-Brazos Delta, as are incised wares (Aten 1983).
The Mayes Island period brought about the introduction of the bow and arrow, which was
probably used along with the atlatl until the historic period (Aten 1983; Story 1990). The arrow
points during this period included both notched and expanding-stemmed forms (Aten 1983;
Story 1990).
Ceramic indicators for the Turtle Bay period include Goose Creek red-filmed along with other
decorated ceramics, all of which are rare in the West Bay-Brazos Delta area. At the beginning of
the Round Lake period, the earliest use of grog or large crushed ceramic particles as tempering
agents is seen. Typical varieties include Baytown Plain (variety San Jacinto) and San Jacinto
Incised. Along with these types, a reduction in Goose Creek types is seen. Aten (1983) describes
this period as having an increase in population due to the larger number of sites in more
specialized locations.
During the Old River period, a resurgence of Goose Creek ceramics is seen as the Baytown types
decrease in popularity. Contact with Europeans begins near the end of this period, but visible
changes in material culture are not seen until about A.D. 1750 along with a rapid decline in
population (Story 1990).

3.2

European Settlement and Harris County History

3.2.1 La Salle’s Expedition
La Salle’s ill-fated French expedition in 1685 explored the area around Matagorda Bay and
established Fort St. Louis near Garcitas Creek. La Salle had originally intended to explore and
colonize along the Mississippi River but the French ships made a critical mistake in his
navigation. La Salle’s fleet lost a supply ship while en route, and another ran aground in

10

Matagorda Bay. His men made enemies of the local Native American population by shooting at
them when the Native Americans attempted to take the French supplies from the wrecked ship.
La Salle’s fleet was further diminished when part of his disgruntled crew took one of his
remaining ships back to France. He lost the last ship in April of 1686 when its drunken pilot sank
it. La Salle and his remaining men attempted to journey to the French Colonies around the Great
Lakes, but none of them would survive. La Salle himself was killed by Pierre Duhaut, one of
several mutineers, near Navasota, Texas, in March of 1687, and his body was left for the animals
to eat. Six of the 17 who had left Fort St. Louis with La Salle continued to Canada and,
eventually, France. Six other Frenchmen, including 2 deserters who had reappeared, remained
among the East Texas Indians.
At Fort St. Louis La Salle had left hardly more than twenty persons, with the crippled Gabriel
Minime, Sieur de Barbier, in charge. They consisted of women and children, the physically
handicapped, and those who for one reason or another had incurred La Salle's disfavor. The
Karankawa, learning of La Salle's death and the disunity among the French, attacked the
settlement by surprise around Christmas 1688, sparing only the children (Weddle 2011).
3.2.2 The San Jacinto District and Harris County History
Harris County was formed as Harrisburg County on December 22, 1836. The county was
renamed Harris in December 1839 to honor John Richardson Harris, an early pioneer who had
established Harrisburg in 1826, the first town site in the county. Harrisburg was established at
the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and Brays Bayou and by the 1830s had become the major port
of entry for the region and a transportation hub. Roads ran northwest to the Brazos communities
of San Felipe and Washington, east to the ferry landing that crossed the San Jacinto, and west
paralleling Brays Bayou to the Oyster Creek Community near present day Stafford in Fort Bend
County.
Under Mexican rule the area surrounding Harrisburg (as it came to be spelled by 1832) was
known as the San Jacinto District. The district stretched east from Lynchburg on the San Jacinto
River west to the location of present day Richmond, and from Clear Creek in the south to Spring
Creek in the north. Harrisburg County encompassed this same territory with the addition of
Galveston Island. The modern boundaries of Harris County were established in 1838 (Henson
2011).
The lands that would become Harris County comprised the southeastern border of Austin’s
Colony. In July of 1824, twenty-nine titles were granted to lands in future Harris County, with an
additional 23 grants made between 1828 and 1833. These original grants concentrated mainly on
the watercourses of the region (Henson 2011). The early settlers in the region were mostly from
the southern United States who brought with them their African slaves. In the 1840s, large
numbers of German and French immigrants settled in Harris County. The Hispanic presence in
the region was relatively sparse prior to an influx of immigrants following the Mexican
Revolution reflecting the ephemeral nature of Spanish and Mexican colonization.
The founding of the city of Houston by Augustus and John Allen was announced in a newspaper
advertisement of August 1836. The brothers managed to convince the delegates of the first Texas
Congress to establish the yet-to-be-built Houston as the first, albeit temporary (1837-1840),
11

capital of Texas. In 1837, Houston also became the seat of Harrisburg County. The town was
laid out on a grid plan with streets running parallel and perpendicular to Buffalo Bayou near the
confluence of White Oak Bayou. The town grew rapidly from 12 inhabitants and 1 log cabin in
January of 1837 to 1500 people and 100 houses 4 months later (Henson 2011).
Initially the city was not segregated and slaves lived scattered throughout the city’s
neighborhoods. There was a separate social structure for the whites and subordinate blacks which
continued beyond the Civil War and Emancipation. Schools, churches, and businesses continued
to be segregated and by the end of the nineteenth century residential segregation was also
present. Separate white, black, and later on Hispanic neighborhoods divided the city.
The immigrants that came to the area following the Civil War founded settlements along the rail
lines that bisected the county. The Houston communities of Pasadena, Deer Park, Houston
Heights, Bellaire, Webster, La Porte, South Houston, and Genoa developed in this manner and
were eventually annexed into the city of Houston. By the 1930s, Harris County was the largest
county and Houston was the largest city in Texas.
By the mid-nineteenth century, Houston and Harris County had become a center of commerce.
Products were imported into the Texas hinterland through Houston after being offloaded from
ocean going ships in Galveston. Exports included agricultural products such as cotton, corn, and
cow hides. The town became a railroad hub with 6 railways spreading from 80.5 to 160.9
kilometers (50 to 100 miles) to the northwest, east, west, south, and southeast. In 1873, Houston
joined the national rail network when the Houston and Texas Central reached Denison (Henson
2011).
The expansion of Buffalo Bayou was essential to the commercial life of Houston and a number
of private ventures were undertaken over the years to widen and deepen the channel. The Army
Corp of Engineers took control of the project in 1881, eventually creating the 15.2-meter (50­
foot) deep Houston Ship Channel from Galveston Bay to a turning basin above Brays Bayou.
Additional public works projects included the creation of Lake Houston reservoir in 1954 to
reduce the dependence on subsurface water, the use of which had caused up to 3 meters (9 feet)
of subsidence surrounding the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River. In 1935,
the Harris County Flood Control District was established and infrastructures such as the Addicks
and Barker dams in western Harris County were constructed. Since this time, channelization
projects completed along Houston area bayous have disturbed any archaeological sites in their
path. However, isolated and undisturbed areas along these watercourses may still contain intact
deposits (Abbott 2001:101).
The discovery of oil at Spindletop made Houston an important center for the petroleum industry.
The Ship Channel’s inland location made it safe from Gulf storms and refineries began lining the
banks in 1918. By 1929, forty oil companies had offices in Houston. The outbreak of World War
II created a demand for products made of petrochemicals. The city would go on to become one
of the 2 largest petrochemical concentrations in the United States (Henson 2011).

4.0 PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Prehistoric archaeological sites identified in the inland regions of the Gulf Coastal Plain tend to
be composed of ephemeral, shallow deposits reflecting short-term occupation episodes. In
general, these sites consist of temporally non-diagnostic lithic scatters, thin subsurface deposits,
or suggest the presence of multiple cultural components within a mixed stratigraphic
archaeological context. Historic sites near the APE typically consist of farm or homesteads
dating to the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. A brief overview of selected prehistoric
and historic research projects conducted in the area is presented below along with the several
cultural resource surveys have been performed within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the APE.
In 2011, HRA Gray & Pape completed an intensive archaeological survey of an adjacent and
overlapping 127.5 hectare (315- acre) tract to the northwest of the current APE (Nash and
Spalding 2011). A total of 418 shovel tests were excavated during survey. Four prehistoric sites
were recorded; none are within the current APE. Site 41HR1097 is a sparse scatter of lithic
debitage and thin-walled pottery sherds located on a sandy rise adjacent to Spring Creek. Site
41HR1098 was located on a sandy rise in the floodplain of Spring Creek adjacent to an
abandoned channel. Artifacts recovered included lithic debitage, lithic tools and pottery sherds.
Site 41HR1099 is set within a sandy rise on the floodplain of Spring Creek. A total of 2 pieces of
debitage were recovered from the location. Site 41HR1100 is a sparse lithic debitage scatter
located at the margin of the upland overlooking the Spring Creek floodplain. Deep testing was
performed in areas that would be deeply impacted and at sites 41HR1098 and 41HR1100.
National Register testing was performed at site 41HR1098. Four 1X1 meter (3X3 feet) units
were excavated at the site in 10-centimeter (4-inch) levels. Two of the sites, 41HR1097 and
41HR1099, were not deep tested; however HRA Gray & Pape recommended deep testing at
these 2 sites should plans change and the sites be impacted. Overall, no further archaeological
work was recommended and none of the sites was recommended for listing in the National
Register.
Two sites were recorded by HRA Gray & Pape during an intensive archaeological survey of the
adjacent 153.5-hectare (379.25-acre) tract of land north of and adjacent to the current APE (Nash
and Spalding 2011). Site 41HR1086 is a buried lithic and ceramic scatter located approximately
130 meters (426 feet) southeast of Spring Creek and some 1000 meters (0.6 mile) north of the
current APE. The roughly boomerang-shaped site was found within a thick sand deposit on a
level 4-hectare (11-acre) area overlooking Spring Creek. Thick coarse grained sediment
underlies the site. The location and thickness of the sand deposits are interpreted as a levee or
terrace of Spring Creek. The site sits at approximately 33 meters (108 to 110 feet) above mean
sea level (AMSL). The channel of Spring Creek lies at the base of sloping valley walls at 25
meters (83 feet) AMSL. A multi-component site 41HR1093 consisting of historic ceramic sherds
and prehistoric debitage was also recorded. This site is located on an elevated, sandy landform
approximately 0.7 kilometers (0.4 miles) north of the current APE. The historic ceramic bottle
sherds were clustered in a very small area and debitage was intermixed with the bottle sherds.
Additional debitage was found in 2 delineation tests. No features were recognized and no
diagnostics were recovered. Neither site recorded during the survey was recommended as
eligible for the NRHP.

13

In 2009, the main road for the development was surveyed by HRA Gray & Pape for the USACE.
A 1.6 kilometer (1 mile) long new road at Spring Crossing was proposed for subdivision access.
The newly constructed gravel road forms the northern boundary of the current survey. The
intensive archaeological survey included pedestrian survey with shovel testing. No sites or
isolated artifacts were found during the survey (Nash 2009).
In 2009, PBS&J performed a survey for TxDOT along an east/west corridor that passes through
the current APE. The survey covered the proposed alignment for Segment G of the Grand
Parkway. Four previously recorded archaeological sites were revisited during the survey;
however, none of these is located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the current APE. No new sites
were recorded during the survey effort (Schubert and Bishop 2009). In 1980, the Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) performed a large area survey located north of Spring
Creek. No further information was available regarding this survey.
In early 1982, a systematic survey of portions of the Addicks Reservoir was conducted by
Prewitt and Associates (Wheat 1953). The survey, covering approximately 1,596 hectares (3,943
acres), concentrated on high probability area such as the Langham, Bear, South Mayde, and
Turkey Creek floodplains. In general, prehistoric sites were identified near reliable water
sources, and within naturally occurring pimple mounds. The survey revisited 9 previously
recorded sites and discovered 39 previously unrecorded prehistoric sites. Historic sites identified
during this survey included farmsteads, domestic home sites, dump sites, and cemeteries, the
majority of which dated to the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. Property associated
with the Addicks Reservoir was investigated through an unsystematic archaeological survey
conducted in 1947 by Joe Ben Wheat. Two sites identified during this survey, 41HR5 (the
Doering Site) and 41HR7 (the Kobs Site) were excavated, and the results contributed to the
development of a relative chronology for the region (Wheat 1953).

5.0 METHODOLOGY
This cultural resources investigation was designed to identify and preliminarily assess cultural
resources that may be impacted by the proposed project. Potential buried and surface, historic
and prehistoric archeological resources fall within the purview of this investigation.
Background research, site file research, historic map and aerial imagery review was initiated
prior to fieldwork mobilization. Background research included geological, geomorphic, and soils
assessment. The site file research included a review of both archeological site files and historic
resource files, and a review of previously conducted cultural resource surveys in the vicinity.
Cultural resources searched for during the site file research included previously recorded
archeological and historical sites, cemeteries, historic markers, NRHP eligible properties, and
previously conducted cultural resources surveys. Historic and modern topographic maps and aerial
imagery were reviewed to search for structures and cemeteries, aid the geoarchaeological
assessment, and to see past land use.

5.1

Background Research

Background research included reviewing geological maps, soil survey maps, and relevant literature
to assess the geoarchaeological potential of the APE. This data is used to preliminarily assess the
type of survey methods that would be appropriate within the survey area. In addition, a review of
aerial imagery of the APE was also conducted prior to a site visit in an attempt to identify current
and historic land use and disturbances, and to search for structures that are or were within or
adjacent to the APE. Other environmental data on climate, flora and fauna, and weather were
gathered from various sources.

5.2

Site File Research

Site file research was initiated by consulting on-line research archives maintained by the THC.
Site file research resulted in an inventory of all previously recorded archaeological sites, all
recorded historic structures, and all previously completed cultural resource surveys located
within a 1.6 kilometer (1 mile) study radius of the APE. All cemeteries and historical markers
within the study radius were also inventoried. Site file research results were used to provide a
historic context to the archaeological survey. Additional documentary research including historic
maps and aerial imagery was conducted in order to provide an understanding of the development
and history of the APE, the surrounding area, and southeast Texas in general. This research was
then used to prepare an overview history of the area and provide an understanding of the
contextual framework of Harris County, Texas, and its prehistory and history.

5.3

Intensive Pedestrian Survey

This intensive archaeological survey was designed to identify and preliminarily assess buried and
surface, historic and prehistoric cultural resources that may be impacted by the proposed project.
In addition to site identification, the intensive archaeological survey also must provide sufficient
data to determine whether or not additional investigations will be required to evaluate fully the
15

potential eligibility of any newly defined site location for inclusion on the NRHP. Archaeological
survey methods utilized during the intensive pedestrian investigations consisted of shovel tests
excavated along parallel transects spaced 100 meters (300 feet) apart. Shovel tests were excavated at
a 100 meter (300 foot) interval along these transects. The results of survey actions at each proposed
shovel test location were recorded on a shovel test form, which include provenience, survey
method, and cultural materials identified.
In areas where sufficient surface visibility allowed for an examination of the ground surface (i.e.
surface visibility in excess of 30 %), a surface inspection of an area measuring 4 meters2 (43 feet2)
was performed at each proposed shovel test location. All prehistoric or historic cultural materials
identified within this block were collected, bagged and provenienced by observation point number.
In addition, all diagnostic artifacts noted during transect survey were recorded by provenience. The
results of the surface inspection activities were recorded on the shovel test form.
In areas where surface visibility was less than 30 %, intensive pedestrian investigations were
performed by the excavation of 30-centimeter (12-inch) shovel tests at each proposed location along
the transect. Shovel tests also were excavated in areas considered likely to contain intact subsurface
deposits regardless of surface visibility. All shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (12 inches) in
diameter at a minimum. Shovel tests were typically excavated to depths of 30 to 45 centimeters (12
to 18 inches) into the underlying substratum and were terminated at extremely compact loam soils.
With the use of a pick mattock, several tests across the APE were excavated to depths of 45 to 80
centimeters (18 to 31 inches). Removed soils were screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth when
possible. Soils with high clay content were sorted by hand. Descriptions of soil texture and color
followed standard terminology and the Munsell (2004) soil color charts. The results of the shovel
test activities, additional information concerning soils encountered and a drawing of the exposed
profiles were recorded on shovel test forms for each excavation.
5.3.1 Site Definition
When a cultural resource was located, additional shovel tests were excavated at 15-meter (50­
foot) intervals or more appropriate intervals at the discretion of the principal investigator in an
effort to define site boundaries and to determine the integrity of surface and subsurface deposits.
Two consecutive negative shovel tests excavated in cardinal directions were used to determine
site boundaries. For each resource identified, photographs were taken of the general vicinity and
of any visible features. A sketch map was prepared, showing site limits, feature locations,
permanent landmarks, topographic and vegetation variation, sources of disturbance, and all
shovel test locations. Sufficient information was included on each map to permit relocation of
the site. Notes were taken on surface and vegetation, soil characteristics, dimensions and
construction of features evident, and the amount and distribution of cultural materials present.
No diagnostic artifacts were found during the survey. A small number of modern nails and other
building materials were the only finds and were not collected. Therefore, laboratory methods are
not included in this report.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
6.1

Results of Site File and Literature Review

Aerial imagery, soil survey maps, and USGS topographical quadrant maps (NCSS 2010; USGS
1963; Wheeler 1976: sheet 31, NAIP 2009, USGS 1995, TxDOT 1989, TxDOT 1979, ASCS
1964, USGS 1957, ASCS 1938, USGS 1995, 1982, 1960, 1942, and 1920) were studied as part
of this project in an effort to assess historic and recent land use in the APE, and to identify
possible historical structures in or adjacent to the APE. With respect to land use, a review of
maps and aerial images suggest that much of the parcel has been disturbed by oil field and timber
operations. Field crews reported ongoing lumber farming across the APE.
There are no previously recorded cultural resources within the APE. However, 6 sites are known
to exist within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the APE (THC Archaeological Sites Atlas 2011).
Prehistoric sites 41HR1086, 41HR1097, 41HR1098, 41HR1099, 41HR1100 and
multicomponent site 41HR1093 are located north and west of the current APE and south of
Spring Creek. None have been recommended as eligible for the NRHP or as SALs. These sites
are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4.0.
There is 1 cemetery located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) radius of the APE. Spring Cemetery
(HR-C137) is also called Highland Cemetery or Spring Colored Cemetery. It is an African
American cemetery located 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) to the east of the APE on Hardy Street
There are no historic markers located within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the APE. The 1950s Kuhl
oilfield could be considered historic, however, only roads, bermed detention basins and sawn-off
pipes that have been uncovered below the surface for environmental investigators remain. Many
better preserved oil fields exist in the general area demonstrate that this site is not worthy of
consideration.

6.2

Results of Field Investigations

Intensive pedestrian survey results were used to assess the potential impact that construction
activities might have on cultural resources located within the proposed APE (Figure 2). The
100% intensive pedestrian survey of the APE employed 30 to 100 meters (98 to 328 feet)
transect spacing. A total of 128 shovel tests were excavated across the APE during the survey.
An additional 43 planned shovel tests were not excavated due to the presence of several gravelfilled parking lots, roads, and a central area filled with a layer of soil 3 to 5 meters (10 to 16 feet)
thick (Figure 2, inset B; Plates 2 and 3). During the current survey, no shovel tests were
excavated in the western portion of the project area that overlaps with a previously surveyed
tract. This area was subjected to an intensive pedestrian survey by HRA Gray & Pape earlier this
year and was shovel tested with similar methodology (Nash and Spalding 2011). No cultural
resources were located in that area. The placement of shovel tests in a 100-meter (328-foot) grid
across the APE exceeds the 1 shovel test per 3 acres minimum described by the current THC
Minimum Survey Standards for areal surveys.

Several occupied residential and commercial buildings are located in the southeastern corner of
the APE near survey transects I and J (Figure 2; Plates 5 through 10). The oldest of these
buildings appear on historic USGS topographic maps from 1960 but do not appear on the 1942
maps. Likewise aerial photographs reveal no structures in 1957 (USGS). Succeeding years
aerials are not clear enough to distinguish structures from vegetation. A few of the structures
appear to be just over 50 years old and therefore are of historic-age. These are discussed further
in the section below regarding historic structures. None of these buildings exhibit the distinctive
design or construction characteristics that would qualify them as eligible for the National
Register.
Two features likely associated with the Kuhlman oilfield were located during survey. One was a
small concrete slab and metal pipe pieces found during the survey, north of Shovel Test J13.
Also likely part of the Kulhman oilfield was a series of small bermed detention ponds and a
nearby concrete base and capped well found east of Shovel Test H9 (Plate 4). It may instead be
the remains of a watering station for grazing cattle with a windmill pump. Shovel tests in the
vicinity did not reveal any artifacts or buried component to these features. HRA Gray & Pape
will not seek a trinomial for either locale.
The remains of a twentieth century structure were found in a small strip of trees between a
recently constructed gravel parking lot and the main gravel road in the northeastern corner of the
APE (Plate 1). The scatter of bricks, concrete, nails, glass, and other residential debris was
spread over an area roughly 60 by 15 meters (200 by 50 feet). Two structures are noted on the
1960 topographic map at the location of the present debris scatter; these do not appear on the
earlier 1942 map. Two shovel tests in the vicinity of the debris piles and concrete foundation
blocks revealed modern artifacts like wire nails to a depth of 20 centimeters (8 inches). No
artifacts were collected. HRA Gray & Pape will not seek a state assigned trinomial for this site.
The site is not recommended as eligible for listing in the National Register.
Shovel tests were largely consistent with the mapped soils (Wheeler 1976). Gessner soils are
mapped in the southern part of the APE in wetland depressions. Wockley series soils occupy the
majority of the central portion of the APE, while Segno soils are found in a limited areas north of
the Wockley soils. A typical soil profile was found in Shovel Test J7B. The top 20 centimeters (8
inches) were composed of a very compact brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam. This layer was followed
by extremely compact brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam with strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) mottles to a
depth of 40 centimeters (16 inches).

6.2.1 Historic-aged Standing Structures
A review of historical aerial photographs and topographic maps revealed no structures noted
within the APE before 1920 or 1942, but 5 present by 1960 along the eastern edge of the project
area (NAIP 2009, USGS 1995, TxDOT 1989, TxDOT 1979, ASCS 1964, USGS 1957, ASCS
1938, USGS 1995, 1982, 1960, 1942, and 1920). Three of these were mapped within the
southeast corner of the APE and 2 were mapped within the northeast corner on the 1960 USGS
topographic map. Historic structures and features were a specific target of the investigation. A
cluster of 8 standing structures was found during the field survey effort in the southeastern
corner of the APE. They were a mix of common residential and utilitarian structures. One
residence and several modern outbuildings appear to still be in-use but 2 residences and most of
the outbuildings are abandoned. The oldest of these structures date to the 1930s (Charles
Cashdollar, personal communication 2011).
Standing Structure #1
This is a 1 story ranch-style house with green asbestos siding and was the last occupied house of
the cluster (Plates 5 and 6). It was built by Charles Cashdollar’s father in 1956. The single car
garage was part of the original construction. The corridor was added and the garage enclosed in
the 70s. Windows on the addition and enclosed garage are modern aluminum but the original
construction has the original 1/1 wooden sash fenestration.
Standing Structure #2
This blue house is a 2 story brick veneered, side-gabled house with 2 gabled dormer windows in
the front lower level near each end and 1 dormer in the front of the house on the second floor
(Plates 9 and 10). The front door is offset to the right and a single bay window is placed left of
the door. A 2-car garage is attached by a breezeway to the left rear corner of the house. Charles
Cashdollar built this house in 1962.
Standing Structures #3, #4, and #9
The original part of this brown wood-sided house was built by Charles Cashdollar’s grandfather
Arthur E. Shill in the 1930s (Standing Structure #3). The house size was doubled in the mid­
1960s with a large addition (Standing Structure #9) and soon after a separate 1-car garage and
apartment (Standing Structure #4) was added (Plates 7 and 8). The newer part of the home is set
on a concrete foundation. The original house was rectangular and side gabled with board and
batten siding. Both parts of the house and the detached garage and apartment are dilapidated. No
one has lived in the house for many years. The windows have been replaced with modern
aluminum windows.
Standing Structure #5
A collection of sheds and modern metal buildings have been joined to create a long shallow
storage and work area for Charles Cashdollar’s hunting blind and feeder business. They are
located along the western edge of the cluster of buildings. The older sheds were moved to the
property in the 1970s. For the purposes of this report, the long storage area made of separate
sheds and metal buildings is treated as a single structure.
Standing Structure #6

24

One carport on the property was made with the roof of a 1930s chicken coup. It was moved to
the property in the 1970s. It is located just west of Standing Structure #5.
Standing Structure #7
A greenhouse on the property was built in the late 1970s. It is located southwest of Standing
Structure #2.
Standing Structure #8
A trailer with 2 major additions was brought on to the property in the 1980s. It is located east of
Standing Structure #2.
Field investigations provided no evidence that Standing Structures 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 and 6 are
significant for their architectural or engineering characteristics (see Plates 5 to 10). Therefore,
none of the structures are recommended as eligible for the NRHP under Criterion C. Field and
archival research yielded no evidence to indicate that the buildings observed within the APE are
associated with historically significant events, trends or patterns of development, or important
individuals. As a result, they are recommended as not eligible for the NHRP under Criteria A and
B that relate to historic events and people. Standing Structures 1, 3, 4, and 9 lack integrity of
design due to additions and remodeling. Standing Structure #3 was moved to the location and
associated outbuildings are missing; therefore, the structures have lost integrity of setting,
feeling, and association. The dilapidated condition of the Standing Structures 3, 4, and 9 affects
the integrity of workmanship and materials. With the addition and assumed loss of outbuildings,
additions, and the moving of Standing Structure #3, the setting no longer conveys a sense of
historic time and place. None of the structures or the site of the demolished houses located on
within the APE are recommended as eligible to the NHRP and trinomials were not sought for the
site or structures.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC, of Houston, Texas, was contracted to conduct a cultural resources
investigation consisting of background and site file research, historic maps and aerial imagery
review, and an intensive archaeological survey of a 166-hectare (410-acre) tract for Berg- Oliver
Associates, Inc. The Lead Federal Agency for this project has been identified as the United
States Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District.
There are no previously recorded cultural resources within the APE. Six previously recorded
archaeological sites are located within a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) study radius; all on elevated
landforms beside Spring Creek. Archival research including historic aerial photographs and
topographic maps depicted no permanent structures on the tract as far back as 1920. The aerials
also depicted land use. The property was entirely wooded in the 1920s and the few cleared areas
visible in 1938 may have been used for grazing until the 1950s. In the 1950s oil was found and
the area became known as the Kuhlman oilfield. In the 1960s when the oil ran dry, the property
was used for tree farming. Cattle grazed the property through all of these transitions (Charles
Cashdollar, personal communication 2011).
A thorough intensive archaeological survey has been completed on the APE. The entirety of the
166-hectare (410-acre) tract was subject to 100–meter (328-foot) interval transect pedestrian
survey with 128 shovel tests excavated during the field survey. Fieldwork performed for this
project located a single archaeological site in the northeast corner of the APE. The site is a 15 by
60 meter (50 by 200 foot) scatter of mid-to-late-twentieth-century residential material. Several
cement foundation blocks were located in situ. Associated artifacts included wire nails, asphalt
shingles, brick, linoleum, aluminum cans, and glass bottles. Most of the material lies on the
ground surface and the area appears to have been bulldozed. HRA Gray & Pape is not seeking a
trinomial for this site and does not recommend it as eligible for listing in the NRHP.
Two locales in the northern portion of the APE were also noted during field survey. Both appear
to be remnants of the Kuhl oilfield operations; one is comprised of a concrete slab with no other
elements of a structure or associated artifacts and the other is a concrete base beside a capped
well and bermed detention basins. The locales are not recommended as eligible for listing on the
NRHP. A total of 8 standing structures were found during the survey within the southeastern
corner of the APE. One of these buildings may have been built as early as the 1930s. However,
none are recommended as eligible for listing on the NRHP.
No cultural resources encountered during the survey are recommended as eligible for the NRHP.
The project was completed on privately owned property and no artifacts were collected during
the survey. All fieldwork and reporting activities were completed with reference to State (the
Antiquities Code of Texas) guidelines. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further cultural
resource work be required and that the project be cleared to proceed as planned.
