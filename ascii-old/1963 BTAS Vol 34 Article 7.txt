ABSTRACT
The purposes and techniques of archeological reconnaissance or survey, particularly as they apply to Texas, are discussed. Specifically reviewed are the preparatory steps necessa ry before going into the field , the actual r econnaissance, and th e
analysis of the sites recorded and the materials collected.

INTRODUCTION

This brief article is designed to set forth , in an abbreviated fashion,
some of the most important features of archeological field surveying,
as it might be practiced in Texas and similar geographic areas. For
those individuals who may wish to pursue the topic further, a select
listing of recommended articles and books on the subject is provided in
the attached bibliography.
Field survey, or reconnaissance, involves the systematic search for
archeological sites and the proper recording of their location and
characteristics. Another feature is the collecting of surface (and, less
commonly_ subsurface ) materials which can be studied to obtain information on the physical and cultural nature of th e site.
A proper foundation in the goals and techniques of archeological
reconnaissance is essential for amateur and professional archeologists
alike. Regrettably, many institutions and amateur societies dedicated
to the study of archeology have been content to assemble miscellaneous
bits of information reported to them by others, rather than conduct
their own investigations of specific geographic areas. However, the
knowledge that can be acquired from planned reconnaissance is manifold: it can be highly valuable for determining limits of specific cultural complexes; for making distribution studies of specific archeological traits; as well as for conducting other types of research which
make use of comparative data. Invaluable information on aboriginal
population size, settlement patterns, etc., also emerges from careful
surveys.
Thorough regional surveys should ~e an integral part of the pro-

204

gram of all organizations that engage in archeological field investigation. The information obtained from them will not only clarify and
supplement the results of previous excavations and research, but will
prepare a basis for future work. This is especially true with respect to
salvage archeology. In this, the archeologist is engaged in a race against
time where extensive construction activities (viz. , dams, reservoirs,
highways, housing) will lead to the destruction of archeological sites.
Governmental agencies such as the River Basin Surveys of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Park Service, as well as state and
local organizations, must carry out adequate surveys of these regions .
Well-founded descriptions of the sites and the materials collected permit evaluation of the sites so that priority in the excavation schedule
can be determined. Limitations of time and funds preclude the excavation , usually, of all sites found during any survey. Nevertheless, when
the most significant sites can be located in time for study and excavation, an appreciable amount of important data and materials can often
be saved from destruction or serious damage.
It is perhaps in the field of archeological reconnaissance that local
groups of amateurs have the greatest opportunity for making a substantial contribution to the field. Many groups which have neither the
time, funds , nor technical training necessary to carry out extensive
excavations can nevertheless make worthwhile surveys in their own
areas. Employing methods similar to those set forth herein, these societies can unify the labors of their members and thus obtain much
important information. To accomplish this end, a central file may be
established to which each individual can contribute data he has gathered and recorded according to standards set forth by the organization.
Many such groups engage in archeological surveying activities on
week ends or during other free time. This work can be done by individuals or by several persons constituting a small field party. Fairly
large tracts of land can thus be covered, and when the sites are accurately located and evaluated, the information can usually be published
in a scientific journal as a survey report.
For the amateur living in a region where there are no local organizations, similar survey methods, modified to fit the imposed limitations,
can be applied successfully. The adoption of a site numbering system
and an adequate method for recording locations and for describing and
evaluating the data is just as obligatory for a single individual as for
a large organization. The amateur archeologist, working alone, can
engage in the same type of investigation undertaken by large groups.
Although this work will necessarily be on a smaller scale, he will still

ARCHEOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE

205

be able to acquire important information about the region which he
studies, provided that he work carefully and maintain accurate records.
PREPARATIONS

Before going into the field, there are a number of preparatory steps to
be taken regardless of the extent or duration of the trip planned. To
begin with, a thorough study should be made of previous archeological
research in the area to be covered. This preliminary library work involves an examination not only of the published reports and papers,
but also of unpublished site records and field notes. In addition to data
contained in the archeological references, helpful information can
many times be found in ethnographic and historical accounts of the
region .
By means of this review of the extant literature, the field worker
should acquire a familiarity with the cultural units represented in the
area, the nature of the sites which are generally encountered there (i.e.,
small open occupation sites, large masonry structures, etc.), and the
artifact types which have been established. A knowledge of the local
system of culture classification and the terminology utilized by other
investigators in the same region will make one's descriptions more
easily correlated with the earlier work.
Helpful details can also be gleaned from old field journals, when
they are available. For example, earlier workers in a particular locality
often solved practical problems of transportation, food requirements,
and living conditions in a fashion best suited to the area; these data
are frequently set down in their field journals. The present investigator
is thus, with this information, spared the necessity of experimenting
for himself and, perhaps, of making costly mistakes.
Another phase of preparation for field work which should be considered is the first-hand examination of a considerable quantity of the
materials (pottery, stone artifacts, or what not) which may have been
recovered previously from sites in the area. A familiarity with these
objects will assist the investigator in making his own identifications.
Personal visits or other communication with former workers is also
worthwhile since these people provide many useful insights into local
problems, based upon actual experiences.
The following institutions have conducted most of the archeological
research in Texas and possess records describing the results of their
investigations:
( 1) Texas Memorial Museum, Austin

206

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

(2) Department of Anthropology, The University of Texas, Austin
(3) Texas Archeological Salvage Project, The University of Texas,
Austin
( 4 ) Witte Memorial Museum, San Antonio
( 5 ) Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum, Canyon
(6 ) Sul Ross State College, Alpine
( 7) The Museum, Texas Technological College, Lubbock
( 8) Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.
Also, numerous local archeological and historical societies throughout the state have records of their work which would likely be of benefit to the investigator. By combining the information obtained from
professional institutions, local organizations, and from archeologists
and amateurs who are familiar with a particular region, the field
worker can acquire a fairly accurate picture of the ground to be covered before he actually takes to the field. In this manner he will be
able to progress more rapidly and accurately than if he had proceeded
without first having made these preliminary investigations.
Another important feature of this preparatory study is the acquisition and careful examination of maps. Among those in Texas which
can most frequently be used to good advantage are the following. There
are, of course, many others.
(1) U. S. Geological Survey ( USGS) : A series of quadrangle topographic maps ranging in scale from 1/ 24,000 to 1/ 125,000;
these maps, however, cover only a portion of the state.
(2 ) Texas State Highway Department: General Highway Maps
prepared for the various counties, with scales of 1/ 126,000, etc.
(3) United States Forest Service: Maps for those areas in the state
which lie within National Forests.
( 4) United States Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and Private Engineering Company Maps: These maps
cover areas of construction and are especially useful for salvage
archeology projects.
The USGS topographic maps are particularly useful for examining
details of terrain as an aid in locating archeological sites. By carefully
studying drainage systems, river flood plains, terraces, bluffs which
might contain rockshelters or caves, etc., one can often select the appropriate areas in which to concentrate one's endeavors. Of course the
distribution of archeological sites in any area may not follow a general
pattern, but when a pattern emerges, the task of locating new sites
becomes much simplified. It must be realized that these distribution
patterns, when they do occur, differ from region to region, and that

ARCHEOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE

207

it is advisable to review the reports and works of investigators who
have been in the area previously, in order to determine the nature of
any such pattern.
The county highway maps can be best used for determining the
most suitable access roads, studying the types of road surfaces, and
making plans for operations during inclement weather. Quite often
small roads and trails are shown on these maps, and a knowledge of
them can be of great aid in planning the route for entering relatively
inaccessible areas. Care should be taken, however, to note the date of
publication of the maps in view of the fact that changes in highways
and road systems are frequent in some areas.
The USGS topographic maps may be acquired from the Office of
Map Information, U. S. Geological Survey, Washington 25, D.C., or
they may be purchased from a:n.y large engineering company or surveying office in the major cities. The county General Highway Maps may
be purchased from the Texas State Highway Department, Austin, or
at the county seats of the various counties.
Of some limited use to the field worker are the soil maps published
by the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Soils, Washington,
and the Geologic Map of Texas, published by the Bureau of Economic
Geology, Austin, Texas. These maps can sometimes be of aid in locating and identifying river terraces, alluvial formations, and other significant natural features. This information may aid in locating sites
of some geologic antiquity, particularly the frequently buried sites of
the Paleo-Indian and Archaic cultures. When relationships between
certain types of archeological sites and geological formations have already been established, these maps and similar geologic publications
show the researcher where to direct his studies.
In recent years much attention has been given to aerial photography. Good aerial photographs, or composite maps made from these
photographs, can be used successfully as supplements to the topographic sheets. Detailed information about specific natural features
and vegetation, and sometimes even archeological sites themselves
can be discovered from such photographs. For example, a disturbance
on the ground will show on a photograph as a difference in tone,
either because of a variation between the color, or the reflecting power,
of the particular feature (or area) and its surroundings. By way of
illustration, the shadows formed by mounds, thick midden areas, or
raised structures can readily be recognized. So, too, can the darker
areas caused by concavities in the earth's surface representing pit
houses, borrow pits, or other man-made depressions. In certain regions

208

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

differences in soil color, due to the presence of a rich, dark midden
humus, can be recognized. For best results, two photographs taken
from slightly different angles should be observed with a stereoscope
in order to produce a three-dimensional view, thus emphasizing the
relief. Such photographs, however, are not easily obtainable, and the
cost of having them made is extremely high. Excellent aerial photographs of much of the United States can be purchased from the U. S.
Soil Conservation Service, Department of Agriculture, which has offices
located in the various county seats.
Another preparation which cannot be overlooked before starting
actual field reconnaissance is the establishment of a site designation
system for recording the finds. For professional archeologists or institutions working in Texas, the three-part numbering system of The
University of Texas is recommended: ( 1) state number ( 41 for Texas ),
(2) county abbreviation, and (3) the site number within the county.
For example, the George C. Davis Site of the Alto Focus has been assigned the number 41 CE19, indicating that this is the 19th site located
in Cherokee County (CE), Texas (41). For a complete listing of
county abbreviations see Table 1.
The amateur who would like to coordinate his investigations with
those of major institutions, may report the sites which he locates to
some university or museum in his area. The report should be made in
a manner which conforms to the recording specifications of that institution. In this way numbers will be assigned to the sites and the amateur may then utilize them in his own records. Not only will these
organizations acquire new data through this arrangement, but the
amateur will also profit. First, he will probably have access to additional information which the university or museum already has recorded in its files. Second, his site designation problem is solved since
he is provided with official numbers. Finally, cooperative relations are
fostered between the professional institution and the amateurs in its
area.
There are a number of less complex systems for designating sites
which are quite adequate and are, in fact, preferred by many amateurs
and local archeological societies because of simplicity and ease of application. For example, sites may be numbered solely by employing
the county abbreviation and a site number within that county. Thus,
HZ-2 is site number 2 in Hudspeth County; another possibility is to
employ the initial of the investigator's surname plus a number assigned
to the site. Hence, J-105 is the 105th site located by Mr. Jones.

FIELD RECONNAISSANCE

Assembling necessary field equipment is the first step in beginning
actual explorations. There are, of course, many items w hich can be of
use; h ow ever, the following brief list of m aterials w ill probably fulfill
th e requirem ents of most situation s.

210

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

1. Cameras and accessories. Any sturdy, easily usable camera is
suitable for the field.
2. Maps. These have been described above in the section on preparations.
3. Army compass or Brunton pocket transit.
4. Measuring tapes. A 100-ft. steel tape and a small 6-ft. or 8-ft.
steel tape.
5. Hand or eye level. This is used for obtaining approximate elevations or for drawing maps.
6. Machete or brush knife. Used for clearing undergrowth.
7. Shovel. One with a rectangular blade is useful for digging small
test pits and cleaning walls of erosional cuts.
8. Mason's trowel. Used for the same purpose as the shovel, but for
work on a smaller scale.
9. Sacks. Of paper, or cloth, for collecting specimens.
10. Whisk broom and paint brushes. For cleaning exposed features.
11. Looseleaf notebook. This should contain lined paper for notes,
graph paper for sketches and maps, site survey forms, and carbon
paper for duplicate copies if desired.
12. Pencils. No. 2 or 3 for general writing, 3H for drawing, and
perhaps a set of colored pencils for maps.
13. Protractor with straight edge. For making sketch maps.
14. Scales. A device in inches or the metric system to be used in all
photographs to show scale of site and features.
15. Directional Arrow. Of fairly large size and painted white; for
indicating direction of north in photographs. This may be combined with item 14.
16. India ink and crow quill pen. For placing cataloque numbers on
specimens collected in the field.
17. First aid kit (snake bite kit may likewise be useful ) .
18. Canteen .
19. Knapsack, or the like. For convenience in carrying equipment,
food, etc.
At the beginning of the reconnaissance the survey party ought, if
possible, to interview people in the area from whom useful information or assistance might be secured. Visits may be made to local construction contractors, research institutions, museums, and libraries.
Amateurs, collectors, and "old timers" who may have an intimate
knowledge of the geography and history of the area may also be sought
out and consulted. By carefully explaining the nature and purpose of
the proposed study, the investigators can often interest others in their

ARCHEOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE

211

activities and thereby obtain valuable information and assistance.
Needless to say, establishing cordial relations with influential persons
in the area to be visited is sometimes important. It is helpful to explain
to these people-especially to those who are civic-minded and interested in the history and background of their community-the significance and goals of the research which is to be undertaken. Such individuals can frequently pave the way for smooth personal dealings with
possible informants. This is a phase of archeological investigation
which should not be overlooked.
Another important factor in the planning of a reconnaissance trip
is the division of the area into convenient sections which can be covered
singly. In this way several persons or groups can work over different
parts contemporaneously, and much time may be saved in the preliminary search.
The next task is to make a quick trip through the entire area to be
surveyed, accompanied, if at all possible, by local people. This is necessary so that the survey party can become familiar at the the outset with
the topography, the roads, and the over-all situation which will confront them.
Next, any sites which have been reported by local informants should
be .visited, mapped, and recorded. Then the investigators are ready
to choose one of the divisions of the area in which to begin an intensive
reconnaissance. By utilizing information obtained from the reports of
other workers and from topographic maps, the survey group will be
in a position to select the most likely geographic .locations (i.e. , river
terraces, river bottoms, cliffs with caves, etc.) in which to begin their
search. After one area has been completely reconnoitered, work in a
new division is begun. By carefully explaining the purpose of the work
to landowners and tenants and by asking permission to search for sites
on their land, tactful and considerate field workers can accomplish infinitely more than those individuals who barge through the countryside leaving gates open and treading upon crops and who, in general,
are inconsiderate of the rights and privacy of others.
Some familiarity with the type of sites frequently encountered in an
area is often necessary in order to be able to recognize archeological
sites readily, assuming, of course, that previous investigations have
been carried on. Generally speaking, sites are recognized by surface
indications which may consist of potsherds, fragments of bone, shell,
flint debris, or other remains of human occupation and activity. Frequently the discoloration of soil in long-inhabited spots and the dense
vegetation which feeds on humus-rich midden soil offer clues to the

existence of a site in the locality. For instance, the difference in the
density, color, and height of cotton or other crops in large fields may
serve as an indication of occupation zones in many sections of the state.
For sites of very great antiquity, especially belonging to Paleo-Indian
cultures, some previous experience with similar localities and a knowledge of geology are often necessary for accurate field identification.
When an archeological site has been located, a minimum-data Site
Survey Form, such as the one presented here, should be carefully completed and any other information, not specifically called for on the
form, of possible importance should be recorded and attached to the
form . A sketch map of the site, drawn to scale, perhaps on graph paper,
should also be prepared and attached to the form. Duplicate copies may
be made of both the form and sketch map for the use of other individuals and institutions.

EXPLANATION OF SITE SURVEY FORM

1. Site No. The site should be assigned a number in accordance with the recording system used by the particular field workers, institution, or archeological
society.
2 . State, 3. County. Fill in where applicable. In other states the township and
range designations should also be included.
4. Location. Include the following data : (a ) location by land surveys where
possible, and (b ) location by distances from towns, road junctions, or n atural
geographic features . These distances should be ,measured, if possible, with the
automobile mileage indicator.
5. Type of Site. It should be stated whether the site is an open occupation site, a
burial area, a rockshelter, a ceramic or lithic site, etc.
6. Cultural Affiliation. This may be determined by an examination of artifacts or
features present. Frequently this is not possible until the completion of the
laboratory analysis of the materials collected.

7. Ownership Data. H ere should be includ ed the nam e and address of the own er
of the land, as well as th e names and addresses of tenants and former owners,
when the information is available. The attitude of th e owner toward s further
investigation or excava tion should also be ascertained and recorded.
8. Informants. The names and addresses of any persons whose aid l ed to th e locacation of the site sh ould be included to aid future inves tigators.
9. Site Description. After the site h as been thoroughly investigated, da ta on the
geographic and topogra phic setting, th e position of the site with respect to
water, natural features, houses and other man-made objects, and any additional
items which th e recorders consider pertinent should be noted in this space.
10. Area of Occupation. For large sites this should be estimated in a cres ; for sm all
sites in terms of feet. yards, or meters. In som e instances tape measurements
can be made.
11. Present Condition. The presence of vegetation or cultivated areas and th e deg ree
of soil erosion should be carefully described.
12. Character and Depth of the Fill. Th e na ture and depth of the soil deposits. or
fill , can often be ascertai ned by cleaning and examining road cuts and erosional
cuts. Where no such examination is possible, a few small test holes, only a few
feet in diameter, may be dug at shallow sites. D ata from these investigatio ns
should be recorded as follows: "su r face to 8 inch es, plow zone; 8 in ch es to 18
in ch es, dark, humu s-stain ed sand, etc." Any such test pits should be recorded
carefully in the notes and sketch map, and should be marked in the fi eld. for
exampl e, by including a bottle or other modern a rtifact in the pit before it is
re fill ed, in order to prevent any misi nterpretation of the fea ture by later investigators. It is a problem to say just how much subsurface investigation is desirable
during a survey. At some sites it may be feasibl e to carry on rather extensive
tes ting. It is frequently desirable in determining the vertical extent of midden
soil, for instance, to establish a coord in ate grid system upon the surface a nd to
sink pits with an auger at regular intervals on the grid pattern. Porta ble motordriven augers, designed for use by two people, are availa ble for this type of
testing. In particular sites, such as those at which elaborate subsurface fea tures
are suspected, proton-magnetometers and like devices may be successfull y used.
13. Previous In vestigation or Excavation . An entry is to be made when a site has
been previously recorded or excava ted. Give th e source of inform ation and
references to publications if a ny exist.
14. Previous Designations for Site. Includ e here all the former names or designations for the site whether applied by local inhabitants, amat eurs, or professional
archeologists. List all sources of information or bibliographic data.
15. Work Done by Survey. Check appropriate spaces.
16. Material Collected. While the site and adja cent areas are being investigated,
surface artifacts and other material of inter est should be collected and placed in
properly Ia belled bags. In the fi eld it is sufficient to sta te that the material
collected includes "potsh erds, projectile points," or wh atever. Sometimes a field
number is placed on a n artifact as soon as it is found in order to insure that
its correct location will be record ed. This is especially important in th e case of
stone axes, pottery vessels, and other objects which may conceivably be h a ndled
before they are sent to th e laboratory. After a labora tory examination of the
artifacts is completed, they should be tabula ted by type and quantity and this
tab ulation should be attached to the site survey form .

17. Material Observed or Reported. This section should be used for recording
materials which were said to have been collec ted at this site, but which are in
the possession of others.
18. Possible Obstacles to Work. This space should be reserved for describing situations which might interfere with excavation, such as thick, tangled underbrush,
or the la ck of cooperation on the part of the landowner.
19. Photographs. Several photographs, taken from different vantage points, should
be made of the site. It is helpful to include natural features and man-made
objects so that the site m ay easily be identified. Photographs should be assigned
field numbers and r ecorded on a field photograph record fo rm. The field numbers assigned should be recorded both on the field photograph record and in
section 19 on the Site Survey Form.
20. Maps of the Site. This space is provided to indicate that a map of the site h as
been prepared and is attached to the field survey form. The sketch, preferably
drawn to scale on gra ph paper, should give information which would be useful
to any individual trying to locate the site. In it should be included ( 1) an
approximate distance scale, (2 ) a directional arrow, (3 ) the main geographic
features su ch as hills, str eams, etc., ( 4 ) heavy vegetation such as woods, thickets,
swamps, etc., (5) cultivated fields , (6) houses or other man-made structures,
( 7) roads or paths, fences, walls, telephone poles, etc., (8 ) the area of the
aboriginal occupation as can be determined from surface indications, preferably
shaded in colored pencil, and (9) a ny other important features or landmarks.
21. Recorded by . The n ames of the individuals responsi ble for completing the site
survey form should be listed here.
22. Date. Give the date or dates when the survey was made.

Information, in addition to that on the site form, that may be pertinent at some sites includes ( 1) approximate elevation of the site above
mean sea level, when determinable from topographic sheets or nearby
surveyors' benchmarkers, and (2 ) the coordinates of the site in degrees, minutes, and approximate seconds of latitude and longitude if
this information can be determined from maps at hand.
When this examination has been completed, the exact location of the
site is to be plotted on the USGS topographic sheets, county road maps,
or other maps used by the survey party.
In practically all instances a field journal proves to be of immense
value not only for the investigators conducting a reconnaissance expedition, but also for subsequent investigators who may wish to review
the work, the trials and tribulations of their predecessors. Some important data which may be included in a day-by-day account of happenings during the survey are the names and addresses of informants
along with the information which they provided, details concerning
the use and functioning of equipment, and an account of the expenses
incurred during the progress of the survey.

ANALYSES

When the survey party has returned from the field, the artifacts
which were collected should be washed and catalogued. The maps and
field notes, together with the photographs, should be organized and
filed for further reference. It is suggested that amateur societies establish a general or central file to which individuals can contribute copies
of the site data forms and notes which they have made in the field.
Thereby an appreciable quantity of important information can be compiled through the years.
After proper cleaning and labelling, the artifacts from the various
sites should be spread out for examination, and typological studies
should be made. After this analysis has been completed, seriation studies are often possible; the areal distribution of artifacts can likewise be
plotted. The importance of surface collections for establishing the distribution of artifact types should not be underestimated, for the results
of such studies, limited as they be by lack of stratigraphic data, can
nevertheless add much to the understanding of the archeological situation in a particular area.
Finally, after the completion of this work, recommendations for the
future excavation of important sites should be made to those institutions and agencies which engage in excavation. Usually the sites which
are selected for intensive study are those which ( 1) seem to offer unusual data not yet encountered in the area, (2 ) hold hope for solving
special regional archeological problems, ( 3 ) are in danger of imminent
destruction, ( 4 ) offer the largest amount of data and material. It
should be emphasized here again that accurate field excavations can
be carried out only by individuals properly trained in that type of
work. However, those who have not received this training can learn
much a bout the archeology of a particular region, and can accomplish
useful investigations, by concentrating their endeavors on systematic
and accurate field reconnaissance.
