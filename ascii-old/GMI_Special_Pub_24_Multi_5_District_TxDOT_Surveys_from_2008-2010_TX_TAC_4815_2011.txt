ABSTRACT

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is responsible for providing safe, effective,
and efficient movement of people and goods. As improvements to the system are partially funded
by the Federal Highway Administration, they are subject to the requirements of Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (of 1966, as amended) and the procedures for compliance
outlined in the implementing regulations 36 CFR 800. In conformity with the provisions of 36
CFR 800.14, compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act is conducted under the First
Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA-TU) among the Federal Highway Administration,
TxDOT, the Texas State Historical Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation Regarding the Implementation of Transportation Undertakings. TxDOT is also
subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas and its implementing regulations 13 TAC 26.
Procedures for compliance follow those outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
between the TxDOT and the Texas Historic Commission (13 TAC 26.14 and 43 TAC 2.24).
In order to partially fulfill its responsibilities under the National Historic Preservation Act and the
Antiquities Code of Texas, TxDOT contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc., under TxDOT Contract #
578 xx SA001, to conduct various archeological Surveys, Impact Evaluations, and Post-Review
Discovery investigations within the Atlanta, Dallas, Lufkin, Paris, and Tyler districts. The
fieldwork was conducted between June 2008 and June 2010 under Texas Antiquities Permit 4815.
Individual interim reports were prepared for each project and appropriate compliance procedures
were followed. This final report presents a compilation of all the individual interim reports.
Work authorizations issued under this contract were undertaken in three of the five districts: the
Dallas and Paris districts in Northcentral Texas; and the Atlanta, District in Northeast Texas. The
Dallas District consists of seven counties (Dallas, Denton, Collin, Ellis, Kaufman, Navarro, and
Rockwall). The Paris District covers a nine-county area (Delta, Fannin, Franklin, Grayson,
Hopkins, Hunt, Lamar, Rains, and Red River). The Atlanta District is also composed of a ninecounty area (Bowie, Camp, Cass, Harrison, Marion, Morris, Panola, Titus, and Upshur). The
construction projects undertaken in TxDOT districts focused on the replacement or rehabilitation
of specific bridge and relief structures on federal and state highways, farm-to-market roads, and
county roads. Other transportation projects involved road widening, post-review discovery
surveys, utility and road realignments, and construction of temporary haul roads. The 15 work
authorizations completed under this contract involved 33 surveys and two impact evaluations.
iii

The final work authorization also included the development and preparation of this report.
TxDOT defines impact evaluation as the initial step in determining whether subsequent survey of
a particular area is warranted, given the anticipated impacts of the project, the existing level of
disturbance, and the likelihood of archeological deposits in good context. Survey is defined by
TxDOT as locating all archeological remains through pedestrian surface examination, shovel
testing, and subsurface mechanical trenching (where appropriate) within the area of potential
effects. Post-review discovery survey consists of a site visit to rapidly evaluate potential historic
properties discovered during construction.
Fieldwork carried out under the various work authorizations investigated 14 sites plotted within
or extending into the project areas of potential effects: four previously recorded sites and 10
newly recorded sites. Of the four previously recorded sites (all prehistoric lithic scatters),
41HS13 was adjacent to the project area, but no indication of the site could be found within the
project area of potential effects. Sites 41BW166 and 41TT108 were found to extend within the
project areas. Site 41HS559 could not be fully investigated because access to the proposed new
right-of-way on which the site is plotted had not been granted at the time of survey, and thus
investigations were confined to the adjacent state-owned portion, where no cultural materials
were found.
Of the 10 newly recorded sites (all of which most likely extend beyond the project APEs), sites
41BW761 and 41BW766 were prehistoric artifact scatters, and 41BW769 and 41HS915 were
lithic scatters with minimal historic artifacts. Sites 41BW767 and 41DT274 (both with minimal
prehistoric artifacts), as well as historic sites 41BW768, 41DT272, 41DT273, and 41DT275
likely represent the remnants of early to mid-twentieth-century occupations.
Sites 41BW166 and 41BW769 were recommended for additional investigation, but the remaining
sites were recommended for no further work within the areas of potential effects. However, if
future impacts were to extend beyond the investigated portions of sites 41HS13, 41HS915, and
41TT108, monitoring or limited testing was recommended for these sites. Because access to site
41HS559 had not been granted at the time of survey, this site was not fully investigated, and
additional investigation was recommended when right-of-entry could be obtained.
All materials collected from these investigations on state property, including photographs, notes,
forms, and artifacts, will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory,
University of Texas at Austin, at the conclusion of this contract.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This document constitutes the final report for work done by Geo-Marine, Inc. (Geo-Marine,
Project #22001.00.20.06), under Contract No. 578 xx SA001 with the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) to provide archeological services in five TxDOT districts—Atlanta,
Dallas, Lufkin, Paris, and Tyler—in Northeast and Northcentral Texas (Figure 1). The contract
began in January 2008 and will conclude in December 2010. During this time, 15 work
authorizations were issued, with the final one being issued so that the draft version of this report
could be submitted in time for review and revisions prior to the end of the contract.
Under this contract, Geo-Marine completed impact evaluations and archeological surveys
(including two post-review discovery surveys) to assist TxDOT in meeting the requirements of its
Memorandum of Understanding (13 TAC 26.14 and 43 TAC 2.24) with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) and the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA-TU) among the
Federal Highway Administration, the Texas Department of Transportation, the Texas State
Historical Preservation Officer, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation Regarding the
Implementation of Transportation Undertakings. TxDOT defines impact evaluation as a
generalized physical inspection of the project area to evaluate the potential for the project area to
contain sites with sufficient integrity to address important research questions (through minimal
shovel testing to examine the character of deposits) and to document any historic markers in the
vicinity of the project area. Thus, an impact evaluation is the initial field step in determining
whether subsequent survey of a particular area is warranted, given the anticipated impacts of the
transportation project, the existing level of disturbance, and the likelihood of archeological
deposits in good context. Subsequent to the impact evaluation, intensive archeological survey as
defined by TxDOT is archeological fieldwork that augments the impact evaluation with
subsurface examination to locate all archeological remains through shovel testing, handexcavated units, and/or mechanical trenching, where appropriate, within the area of potential
impact. Post-review discovery survey consists of a site visit to rapidly evaluate potential historic
properties discovered during construction.
Geographically, the five districts are in Northcentral (the Dallas and Paris districts) and Northeast
Texas (the Atlanta, Lufkin, and Tyler districts). The Dallas District is composed of seven
counties (Dallas, Denton, Collin, Ellis, Kaufman, Navarro, and Rockwall), and the Paris District
covers a nine-county area (Delta, Fannin, Franklin, Grayson, Hopkins, Hunt, Lamar, Rains, and
1

Red River). In the geographic Northeast Texas region, the Atlanta District covers a nine-county
area (Bowie, Camp, Cass, Harrison, Marion, Morris, Panola, Titus, and Upshur). The Lufkin
District also encompasses nine counties (Angelina, Houston, Nacogdoches, Polk, Sabine, San
Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, and Trinity), and the Tyler District consists of eight counties
(Anderson, Cherokee, Gregg, Henderson, Rusk, Smith, Van Zandt, and Wood).
The current contract involved 15 archeological work authorizations for 35 CSJs, involving field
projects in three (the Atlanta, Dallas, and Paris) of the five TxDOT districts. Some of the work
authorizations consisted of multiple tasks involving 33 archeological surveys and two impact
evaluations. The final work authorization additionally included the production of this report (five
work authorization numbers were not issued). Fieldwork was conducted between June 2008 and
June 2010 by Geo-Marine archeologists and architectural historians.
Most of the TxDOT construction projects focused on the replacement or rehabilitation of specific
bridges and relief structures on interstate or federal highways (IH or US) and state highways
(SH), farm-to-market (FM) roads, and county roads (CR). Other kinds of transportation activities
included road widenings, new temporary haul road constructions, and utility and road
realignments.
During the course of these investigations, 14 archeological site locations were either revisited
(41BW166, 41HS13, 41HS559, 41TT108) or newly recorded (41BW761, 41BW766, 41BW767,
41BW768, 41BW769, 41DT272, 41DT273, 41DT274, 41DT275, 41HS915). Among these 14
sites or portions of sites identified within the project areas, eight are prehistoric or predominantly
prehistoric (41BW761, 41BW766, 41HS13, 41BW166, 41BW769, 41HS915, and 41TT108), and
six are historic-era or predominantly historic-era (41BW768, 41DT272, 41DT275, 41BW767,
41DT273, and 41DT274) occupations. All collected artifacts were recovered within state-owned
right-of-way (ROW), and along with all materials generated by this project, will be permanently
curated at the Texas Archeology Research Laboratory (TARL) at the University of Texas at
Austin at the conclusion of this contract.
The body of this report presents a brief characterization of the environmental setting of the five
TxDOT districts; a synopsis of the cultural background of Northeast and Northcentral Texas;
summaries of impact evaluations and surveys conducted under this contract; discussions of the
site investigations and recommendations for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
eligibility and for State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation; and the overall
recommendations concerning the impact evaluation and archeological survey results. The body
of the report is followed by a References Cited section and Appendix A, Glossary of Technical
Terms.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The five TxDOT districts under this contract lie within the Blackland Prairie and Gulf Coastal
Plains physiographic provinces, which together form part of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic coastal
geosyncline (Murray 1960). This geosyncline consists of a gradually sloping basin that dips
toward the Gulf of Mexico and contains formations of limestone and sandstone deposited along
the margins of an ancient receding coastline. As the Gulf of Mexico formed during the late
Cretaceous, clastic sediments and carbonates were deposited over the worn-down Ouachita
Mountains to the northwest, and along the broad marginal shelf of the gulf basin. The Lower
Cretaceous sandstones, mudstones, limestones, and marls found throughout parts of the study
area represent cycles of marine transgression and regression throughout the period. By Upper
Cretaceous times, the gulf basin infilling and shoreline progradation predominated as evidenced
by Upper Cretaceous sandstones and mudstones throughout much of the region. The geologic
formations found in these areas are the Navarro and Taylor groups, Claiborne group, Wilcox and
Midway groups, and the Catahoula Formation, along with the ubiquitous Quaternary and
Holocene Alluvial sediments (Bureau of Economic Geology [BEG] 1992).
Within the five TxDOT districts under consideration in this study are six major drainage basins:
the Red River, the Sulphur River, Cypress Creek, the Sabine River, the Angelina/Neches rivers,
and the Trinity River (Figure 2). Four of these are among the 12 largest in the state of Texas.
The Red River, which flows east along the northern edge of the research area (in particular
forming the northern border of the Paris District), drains over 30,000 square miles in Texas (BEG
1996). The Sulphur River and Cypress Creek are considered part of the Red River macrodrainage. The Sabine River drains over 7,400 square miles over its 360-mile course and includes
two major reservoirs (BEG 1996). The Neches River runs for 416 miles and drains over 10,000
square miles of eastern Texas; the Angelina River is considered a tributary of the Neches, and
their confluence lies just south of the TxDOT Lufkin District (BEG 1996). Skirting the western
edge of the study area, the Trinity River basin is 550 miles long, drains over 17,000 square miles
of land, and includes 14 major reservoirs along its three major branches (BEG 1996).
The project areas investigated under this contract contain very diverse soil characteristics. The
macro divisions of environments include upland, floodplain, and terrace deposits. The upland
deposits vary from loams and sands overlaying clays or loams to all clay deposits. These areas
are gently sloping to moderately steep with varying degrees of permeability and drainage. The
5

ground cover in upland areas usually consists of woodland or pasture grasses; many of the upland
areas have suffered from erosion due to extensive timber cutting and poor management of soils.
Most upland soils are acidic in nature with some alkaline exceptions. The alluvial nature of
floodplains has made them highly variable in their pedological expressions. In high-energy
depositional environments, soils often consist entirely of sands, versus low-energy back swamps
containing fine clays. Large variations in deposition, including natural levees and point bars
contained in floodplains, were found in relatively small spatial areas. Ground cover in these
lowland areas varies from woodland and pasture to crops. These soils vary from poorly to
moderately well drained, and pH levels range from acidic to alkaline. Terrace deposits have
similar stratigraphy to some upland deposits, in addition to containing wind-modified deposits in
some areas. These areas are usually well drained, so much so that they often show evidence of
erosion such as gullies and deflation to the underlying geologic formations. The soils of
Northcentral and Northeast Texas are exemplified by broad diversity, and this can be a
challenging factor for archeologists to consider in their interpretations in impact evaluations and
archeological surveys (Fox 1980; Roberts 1983, 1990).
Climatically, the project areas are characterized by long hot summers and short cool winters.
Cold waves in the winter are rare and not severe, usually lasting only one or two days.
Temperatures rarely exceed 41 degrees Celsius (°C; 106° Fahrenheit [F]) in the summer, or fall
below -12°C (10°F) in the winter, but the variation is sufficient to produce four distinct seasons—
a mild winter, a warm spring, a hot summer, and a warm autumn. The number of days in the
growing season with temperatures above freezing averages between 228 and 270 (Fox 1980:2,
81; Nixon 1985:7; Roberts 1983, 1990).
Precipitation is fairly heavy throughout the year. Prolonged droughts are rare, and frequent
afternoon thunderstorms in summer are adequate to maintain crops. Severe storms, including
tornadoes, strike the area occasionally and often cause flooding and erosion. Every few years in
the summer or fall, a tropical depression moves inland, causing extremely heavy rains for one to
three days. Average annual precipitation ranges from 89 centimeters (cm) to over 127 cm (35–50
inches [in]) and is usually distributed quite uniformly throughout the year (Nixon 1985:7).
Snowfall is variable but rare (Fox 1980:2; Roberts 1983, 1990).
The modern plant communities vary from subregion to subregion (Figure 3). The Mixed PineHardwood Forest (forests having greater than 60 percent canopy) is composed of loblolly pine
(Pinus taeda), shortleaf pine (P. echinata), overcup oak (Quercus lyrata), swamp chestnut oak
(Q. michauxii), willow oak (Q. phellos), water oak (Q. nigra), sweetgum (Liquidambar
styraciflua), and sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana) (Diamond et al. 1987). Deciduous woodlands
(woodlands having 26–60 percent canopy) of bluejack oak (Q. incana; also known as sandjack
oak) and pine and swamp communities of bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), buttonbush
(Cephalanthus occidentalis), and water elm (Planera aquatica) are also a part of the Mixed PineHardwood Forest. The Oak Woodlands (i.e., Shortleaf Pine-Post Oak-Southern Red Oak) forest
covers portions of Northeast Texas. The most common trees present within this vegetation zone
are red oak (Q. rubra), post oak (Q. stellata), hickory (Carya Nutt.), and shortleaf pine (Roberts
1983, 1990:52). Other associated species within this vegetation zone are loblolly pine, black
hickory (Carya texana Buckley), sandjack oak, flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), common
persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), sweetgum, sassafras (Sassafras albidum), greenbrier (Smilax
spp.), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), American beautyberry (Callicarpa
americana), hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), supplejack (Flagellaria indica), winged elm (Ulmus
alata), beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), spranglegrass (Diplachne spp.), Indiangrass
7

(Sorghastrum nutans), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), three-awn (Aristida adscensionis),
bushclover (Lespedeza capitata), and tickclover (Desmodium illinoense) (McMahan et al.
1984:25). Although the Longleaf Pine Forest once covered millions of acres across the
southeastern United States, few stands of the forest are extant. Most of the old-growth forest has
been logged for timber and the original forest replaced with faster-growth pine species. However,
one old-growth Longleaf Pine Forest in Texas has been set aside for preservation in the southern
part of the Lufkin District. The old-growth forest of towering longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) has,
among other species, an understory of dogwood (Cornus spp.), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica),
and pawpaw (Asimina spp.) trees, with groundcover of various tall grasses (e.g., bluestem
[Andropogon spp.] and panicum [Panicum spp.]) and, in sandy barrens, prickly pear (Opuntia
spp.) and trailing phlox (Phlox nivalis) (Conservation Priorities for Texas 2008; McMahan et al.
1984; Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2008).
The Blackland Prairie consists of tall grasslands, primarily little bluestem (Schizachyrium
scoparium) and Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), with riparian deciduous forests of hackberry
(Celtis occidentalis), sugarberry (Celtis laevigata), and elm (Ulmus spp.) (Diamond et al. 1987).
The flora of the Eastern Cross Timbers is made up of deciduous forests of post oak (Q. stellata)
and black hickory (Carya texana), and woodlands of post oak and blackjack oak (Q.
marilandica). The Grand Prairie is a mixed-grass prairie dominated by little bluestem and
containing isolated live oak mottes as well as juniper (Juniperus spp.) and mesquite (Prosopis
spp.) savannas (Hayward et al. 1996). The Western Cross Timbers consists primarily of
deciduous woodlands of post oaks and blackjack oaks (Diamond et al. 1987).
In addition to the timber and wood resources of the area, acorns, nuts, berries, and grasses were
available to both prehistoric and historic-age groups. Trees bearing edible nuts identified as
being present in Northeast and Northcentral Texas include eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra),
pecan (Carya illinoinensis), shellbark hickory (C. laciniosa), shagbark hickory (C. ovata),
mockernut hickory (C. alba), black hickory (C. texana), nutmeg hickory (C. myristiciformis),
swamp hickory (C. cordiformus), pignut hickory (C. glabra), American beech (Fagus
grandifolia), Allegheny chinquapin (Castanea pumila), Ashe chinquapin (Castanea pumila
ozarkensis), white oak (Q. alba), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), and live oak (Q. virginiana)
(Heartfield and Dieste 1984a, 1984b; Vines 1977).
Faunal resources available to prehistoric and historic-age populations in Northeast and
Northcentral Texas would have included numerous types of invertebrates along the major
streams, as well as various species of mollusks, both bivalves and gastropods, in addition to
crustaceans (Swanton 1946). In prehistoric and early historic times, fish resources would have
included gar (Lepisosteus spp.), crappie (Poxomis spp.), white bass (Morone spp.), black bass
(Micropterus spp.), buffalo (Ictiomus spp.), shad (Dorosoma spp.), bowfin (Amia calva), various
shiners (Notropis, Cyprinella, and Notemigonus spp.), chain pickerel (Esox niger), catfish
(Ictalurus and Pylodictus spp.), sunfish (Lepomis spp.), and freshwater drum (Aplodinotus
grunniens) (Blair 1950; Heartfield and Dieste 1984a, 1984b:2–6). Various species of frogs,
turtles, and salamanders, as well as alligators (Alligator sinensis) would have been present.
A wide variety of migratory birds such as ducks, geese, and cranes (families Anatidae and
Gruidae would have been most numerous in the late fall and early winter, and other resident
birds, such as turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) and mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), would
have been available year-round. Mammal species would have consisted of whitetail deer
(Odocoileus virginianus), bear (Ursus americanus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), rabbit (Sylvilagus
9

spp.), opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), and raccoon (Procyon lotor) (Swanton 1946). Valuable
fur-bearing animals would have included rabbit, beaver (Castor canadensis), raccoon, weasel and
mink (Mustela spp.), ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), opossum, red fox (Vulpes vulpes), gray fox
(Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Felis rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), badger (Taxidea taxus),
spotted skunk (Spilogale spp.), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus),
and river otter (Lutra canadensis) (Blair 1950). Several economically important species that may
have once inhabited the area, such as pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) and bison
(Bison bison), are now locally extinct (Blair 1950:100–102).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

INTRODUCTION
The following chapter is intended to provide a general background to the archeology of both
Northeast and Northcentral Texas, while supplying the interested reader with sufficient references
for a more in-depth study of specific cultural periods. This chapter is divided into three sections,
the first of which gives a brief summary of previous archeological investigations in the research
areas; given the size of the region, this section must necessarily be limited in scope. The second
section briefly discusses the nature of the prehistoric and historic-age Native American
archeological records in broad terms, and the third considers the historic-age European and
American settlement in the area.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Early archeological research in Northcentral and Northeast Texas was intermittent and of limited
scope. The earliest known investigations in Northeast Texas occurred in 1879–1880 and were
conducted by Edward Palmer of the Peabody Museum. Although his primary occupation was the
collection of plants, he also collected artifacts for the museum and wished to ascertain whether
the ―Mound Builders‖ were to be found in East Texas. His investigation was apparently cursory,
as Palmer concluded that mound sites were not to be found in Texas (McVaugh 1956; Putnam
1880). After this, no archeology is known to have been undertaken in the northeastern portion of
Texas until early in the twentieth century, when Clarence B. Moore of the Philadelphia Academy
of Science ascended the Red River to investigate the archeology of Louisiana, Arkansas, and
Texas, publishing his findings in 1912. No excavations were undertaken in Texas, but the Cabe
Mounds site (41BW14), the E. H. Moores site (41BW2), and the A. J. Hatchel site (41BW3) were
examined (Moore 1912).
Beginning in the 1920s, more intensive and regionally based archeological investigations were
begun by J. E. Pearce, the founder of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Texas.
Early research was concentrated in Northeast Texas due to the large number of mound and burial
sites reported for this region. In 1919, Pearce was able to get funding from the Bureau of
American Ethnology (BAE) that allowed a reconnaissance into Northeast Texas. Based on the
11

examination of numerous collections, visits to sites in 14 counties, and limited test excavations,
Pearce concluded that Northeast Texas had tremendous research potential (Barnard 1939; Pearce
1924, 1931, 1932a). Funding proved to be the major constraint on Pearce‘s research, as he did
not receive another major grant until 1927, when he was awarded monies from the Laura
Spelman Rockefeller Foundation of New York City (Barnard 1939). From 1920 until 1935,
Pearce and his crews conducted excavations at approximately 123 sites in Northeast Texas.
Gardner (1931), Goldschmidt (1935a, 1935b), Jackson (1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938), and
Pearce (1931, 1932a, 1932b) reported on some of those investigations.
Truly intensive archeological research had to wait until the Depression, when archeological
projects became one component of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a federal jobs
program. Funding under the WPA greatly exceeded anything previously seen in Texas, allowing
extensive site investigations and the accumulation of a huge regional database. Among the sites
investigated by the WPA in Northeast Texas were the Hatchel-Mitchell site complex (41BW3
and 41BW4, respectively) along the Red River (Davis 1970; Doran 1975; Dow 1987; Duffen et
al. 1940; Gilmore and McCormick 1980; Krieger 1946; Maples 1962; Suhm et al. 1954); the
George C. Davis site (41CE19) along the Neches River (Duffen et al. 1940; Ekland-Olson 1981;
Fritz 1975; Keller 1974; Newell and Krieger 1949; Shafer 1973; Spock 1977); and the Yarbrough
(41VN6) and Joslin (41VN3) sites in the Sabine River basin (Johnson 1962). Only interim
reports were published for much of that work; however, the database thus derived has provided
fertile ground for later students.
Avocational archeologists from Dallas, Texarkana, and elsewhere also began to work intensively
in the region during the 1930s (Harris 1964; Miroir n.d.). The most prominent was Dr. Clarence
H. Webb, a pediatrician from Shreveport, Louisiana. Webb‘s work in northern Louisiana and
East Texas was influential in the development of the regional culture history, especially for the
Caddoan tradition (e.g., Ford and Webb 1956; Fulton and Webb 1953; Webb 1941, 1945, 1946,
1948a, 1948b, 1956, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1963, 1968; Webb and Dodd 1939, 1941; Webb and
McKinney 1975; Webb et al. 1969, 1971). Some of the sites excavated by Webb and his
associates include the Smithport Landing site (16DS4), the Belcher Mound site (16CD13), the
Gahagan Mound site (16RR1), the Mounds Plantation (16CD12), and the Resch site (41HS16).
At the same time, nonprofessionals and collectors from Dallas and Texarkana also began to
excavate into Caddoan mound and cemetery sites in extreme Northeast Texas (see, for example,
Harris 1953 and Miroir n.d.).
After World War II, there was no need for the WPA, and large-scale investigations were no
longer funded by the federal government. However, since the government was proposing the
construction of a series of reservoirs across the country, it was determined that archeological
investigations would be funded in order to salvage some of the data that would otherwise be
destroyed. The National Park Service served as the lead agency for this work, but the actual
fieldwork was undertaken by the River Basin Survey (RBS), which was formed as a part of the
Bureau of American Ethnology. Investigations undertaken at relevant lakes in North Texas by
the RBS and successor organizations included Lake O‘ the Pines (Davis 1961; Davis 1958, 1970;
Davis and Gipson 1960; Davis and Golden 1960; Jelks and Tunnell 1959; Lisk 1984; Miller et al.
1951; Thurmond 1981, 1990; Tunnell 1959; Turner 1978); Wright Patman Lake (Briggs and
Malone 1970; Jelks 1961; Stephenson 1950); and Lake Tawakoni (Duffield 1961; Duffield and
Jelks 1961; Johnson 1957). Other regionally important examples include Cooper Lake (Duffield
1959; Gilmore and Hoffrichter 1964; Harris 1955; Hatzenbuehler 1953; Johnson 1962; Moorman
and Jelks 1952) along the Sulphur River; and Lake Lavon (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lynott
1975; Stephenson 1949, 1952) and Lake Ray Hubbard (Harris and Suhm 1963; Lorrain and
12

Hoffrichter 1968) along the East Fork of the Trinity River. Much of the excavation effort within
the upper Trinity River basin has similarly focused on reservoir development, especially along the
Elm Fork (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Skinner and Baird 1985; Skinner et al. 1982) and
the East Fork (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross
1966).
Beginning in the late 1960s, federal and state governments began to require consideration of the
potential environmental impacts of government-funded projects. These regulations included
assessing the impacts to archeological resources. During the last several decades, the gradual
growth of the cultural resources management (CRM) industry, composed of government
agencies, universities, and private companies, has taken place. Survey and testing were
undertaken at a number of Northcentral and Northeast Texas reservoirs during this period: Lake
Bob Sandlin (Driggers 1985; Flaigg 1982; Herrington 1979; Hsu 1969; Sullivan 1975; Thurmond
1981, 1990); Lake Fork Reservoir (Bruseth 1975; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Bruseth et al. 1977;
Crane 1982; Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Skiles et al. 1980; Skinner 1975a; Thurmond 1985);
Black Cypress Reservoir (Northern and Skiles 1981); Big Sandy Reservoir (Gibson 1982;
Perttula et al. 1986); and Lake Gilmer (Horizon Environmental Services, Inc., 1992; Nichols et al.
1997). In addition, further investigations were undertaken at previously inundated lakes such as
Lake O‘ the Pines (Gulf South Research Institute 1974; Thurmond 1981, 1990), Wright Patman
Lake (Shiner 1982), and Caddo Lake (Campbell et al. 1983; Gibson 1969; Gulf South Research
Institute 1974; Thurmond 1981, 1990). In the late 1990s and into the 2000s, reservoir surveys
were undertaken at Toledo Bend for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE; Drake 2000),
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (Robinson 1997), and the U.S. Forest Service (Skiles
1993); at Lake Livingston (Driver 2004; Galan 2000) for private corporations; and at Lake Sam
Rayburn (Jones and Trierweiler 2005; Nichols 1995; Trierweiler and Galan 2002) for the
USACE.
Intensive CRM studies have been undertaken at Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in eastern
Harrison County, near Karnack (Cliff et al. 1995; Cliff and Peter 1994b; Cliff, Peter, Largent, and
Waite 1996; Dieste et al. 1985; Peter and Stiles-Hanson 1989). Several lignite mines have also
been examined in the area, including Karnack (Heartfield, Price, and Green, Inc., 1986), Darco
(Carlson 1985; Corbin et al. 1976; Perttula and Skiles 1987; Studer 1980, 1982), and South
Hallsville (Dibble 1977; Espey Huston & Associates, Inc., 1979, 1984; Freeman 1978; Keller
1990a, 1990b, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996a, 1996b, 1998, 1999, 2000a, 2000b; LaVardera 1983a,
1983b, 1984a, 1984b, 1985; North American Consultants, Inc., 1984, 1985). More recent work in
the Caddo Lake area has focused on surveys of Harrison Bayou (Perttula and Nelson 1999), test
excavations at the Timber Hill site, a historic-age Caddo village on James Bayou (McCrocklin
1998; Parsons 1999), and intensive survey and some test excavations at Lake Bob Sandlin Park in
the Big Cypress Creek drainage (Perttula and Nelson 2002).
Two large, recent projects near Wright Patman Lake (formerly Lake Texarkana) have been
undertaken at the White Oak Creek Wildlife Management Area (WOCWMA) in Cass, Bowie,
Morris, and Titus counties, and at the Red River Army Depot and Lone Star Army Ammunition
Plant (RRAD/LSAAP) in Bowie County. The former was developed by the USACE to mitigate
the loss of wildlife habitat due to inundation of Cooper Lake farther upstream along the Sulphur
River. It consists of approximately 25,000 acres of bottomlands and the adjacent upland margins
along White Oak Creek and the Sulphur River. These investigations began with the preparation
of a research design to guide the work (Peter, Cliff, and Abbott 1990) and have included surveys
(Cliff 1994; Cliff and Peter 1992; Cliff, White, Hunt, Pleasant, and Shaw 1996), site testing (Cliff
and Hunt 1995; Largent et al. 1997), and data recovery (Cliff, Green, Hunt, Shanabrook, and
13

Peter 1996). The other project consisted of a series of studies designed to inventory and evaluate
the cultural resources present in the RRAD/LSAAP in central Bowie County. These
investigations have included surveys (Cliff and Peter 1994a; Cliff, Hunt, Green, Peter, and Kent
1996; Gadus and Freeman 1998; Newman 1988; Peter and Cliff 1990a, 1990b), limited testing
(Cliff and Peter 1988), and the preparation of a cultural resources management plan, including an
overview of Bowie County and the Great Bend in general (Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I).
To the west of Wright Patman Lake, in Titus and Franklin counties, extensive cultural resources
investigations have been undertaken by Espey Huston & Associates, Inc. in association with
surface coal mining projects. At the Monticello B-2 Mine, north of Mount Pleasant, 237
prehistoric and historic-age archeological sites were recorded within approximately 20,000 acres
(Jones et al. 1993). Subsequently, testing was conducted at six prehistoric sites in 1991 (Kotter et
al. 1993) and an additional 10 sites in 1993 (Nash et al. 1995). On the basis of this work, data
recovery was conducted at two sites in 1993 and 1994 (Dixon et al. 1995, 1998; Perttula 1998a;
Perttula and Nelson 1995; Perttula, Neff, Glascock, Mulholland, Nelson, Tate, Cogswell, Skokan,
and Rogers 1998). Additional site testing in 1996 resulted in data recovery at the Ear Spool site
(41TT653), a Late Caddo Titus phase farmstead (Galan 1998). Elsewhere in Titus County, a
survey of 2,716 acres at the Monticello I Area, southwest of Mount Pleasant, recorded another 22
prehistoric and historic-age sites (Hoyt et al. 1994). TxDOT projects in Titus County include
data recovery at site 41TT13 (Rogers et al. 2003) as well as survey and ongoing testing along the
proposed relief route for US 271 around Mount Pleasant.
Other recent archeological activities of importance in Northeast Texas include the 1987
excavation by the Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation of a small Caddoan
hamlet and cemetery at the Murphy Branch site (41MX5) north of White Oak Creek (Brewington
and Dockall 1991; Brewington et al. 1995; Wormser 1988); data recovery at site 41BW422 along
Barkman Creek north of Hooks in Bowie County (Tucker 1994); excavations at the Oak Hill
Village site (41RK214), a large Caddo village in Rusk County (Cruse 1995; Rogers and Perttula
2004); excavations at the Rookery Ridge site (41UR133), a Late Caddo hamlet at Lake Gilmer in
Upshur County (Parsons 1998); and data recovery at the Pilgrim‘s Pride site (41CP304), an
Archaic and Late Caddo Titus phase site in Camp County (Perttula 1999). Recent projects in the
immediate vicinity of Wright Patman Lake include a survey of the Beltex Lateral Pipeline in Cass
County south of the lake (Skinner 1992); small surveys conducted at Atlanta State Park for the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (Perttula 1998b; Perttula, Prikryl, and Nelson 1997; Turpin
1994a, 1994b); a number of surveys of timber-cutting areas surrounding the lake (Burson and
Cliff 2000; Cliff and Hunt 1998; Cliff, Hunt, Pleasant, Procter, and Ensor 1996; Hunt and
Borrego 2002; Hunt and Cliff 1998a, 1998b; Linder-Linsley and Lindsay 1997, 1998; Moore et
al. 1998; White et al. 1995); and testing of five prehistoric sites at the proposed Malden Lake
Park expansion (Owens and Hunt 1999). Recent investigations at Lake O‘ the Pines include
several timber-cutting-area surveys (Burson and Cliff 2000; Cliff and Hunt 1998; Hunt and
Borrego 2002; Hunt and Cliff 1998a, 1998b; Hunt et al. 1995; Linder-Linsley and Lindsay 1997,
1998; Moore et al. 1998), a survey of two proposed pump stations (Brazos Valley Research
Associates 1997), a city of Longview water pipeline (Perttula, Turner, and Nelson 1998), and
investigations by the Friends of Northeast Texas Archaeology archeologists (Perttula and Nelson
1997, 2001; Perttula et al. 1996). More recently, Geo-Marine completed an intensive pedestrian
survey of the new 51-kilometer (km; 32-mile [mi]) Lake O‘ the Pines South Side Regional Water
Supply System that traverses parts of Gregg, Harrison, Marion, and Upshur Counties (Largent,
Lintz, Huhnke, Hunt, Allday, Salo, and Green 2004), identifying nine new archeological sites and
revisiting two previously known sites.
14

The delay of the construction of Cooper Lake until the 1980s contributed to a more intensive
investigation of Cooper Lake than of other reservoirs. This work was conducted in three phases:
(1) the early investigations (1952–1964) mentioned above, (2) a return to Cooper Lake in the
1970s (Doehner and Larson 1978; Doehner et al. 1978; Hyatt and Doehner 1975; Hyatt and
Skinner 1971; Hyatt et al. 1974), and (3) mitigation efforts in the 1980s and early 1990s (Bailey
et al. 1991; Bousman et al. 1988; Cliff 1994; Fields et al. 1991; Fields et al. 1993; Fields and
Gardner 1991; Gadus et al. 1991; Gadus, Fields, and Bousman 1992; Gadus, Fields, Bousman,
and Howard 1992; Jurney and Bohlin 1993; Jurney et al. 1993; Lebo 1988; McGregor and
Roemer 1989; Moir and Jurney 1988; Moir et al. 1989; Perttula 1988a, 1988b, 1989a, 1989b;
Shepard et al. 1994; Winchell et al. 1992).
In Nacogdoches County, several recent projects have been completed in the Lake Naconiche area.
An archeological survey, recording 61 prehistoric and historic sites, was undertaken for the
proposed 1,265-acre floodwater and recreational structure on Naconiche Creek for Nacogdoches
County, sponsored by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (Perttula 2000).
Subsequently, 10 prehistoric sites were selected for Phase II testing based on their research
potential (Perttula 2002). More recently, intensive survey for a gas pipeline in the area was
undertaken to determine the presence/absence of cultural resources, particularly focusing on the
area where the line crossed Naconiche Creek (Iruegas 2004). Another project in Northeast Texas
involved data recovery at the Broadway site (41SM273), situated along a tributary of the
Angelina River in Smith County (Perttula and Nelson 2004). Additionally, Perttula (2006)
completed a study of cultural materials from numerous Northeast Texas Caddo sites held in a
private collection.
In Northcentral Texas, extensive archeological investigations have been undertaken as a result of
the construction of Lewisville Lake (formerly known as Lake Dallas and Garza-Little Elm
Reservoir) and Lake Ray Roberts (formerly known as Aubrey Reservoir). Lewisville Lake has
been expanded several times as the population of the Dallas-Fort Worth area has grown; its
earliest incarnation, Lake Dallas, existed prior to 1936. Archeological investigations for
Lewisville Lake began in 1948, when archeologists from the RBS investigated the proposed
reservoir area. Twenty-seven sites were found during this survey; 14 had previously been
recorded by members of the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS; Stephenson 1949, 1950). Three
sites, Ledbetter (41DN5), Lake Dallas (41DN6), and Bob Pierce (41DN12), were tested by RBS
crews in 1951, although the results have never been reported (Prikryl 1987). During and after the
RBS investigation, members of the DAS continued to investigate the Lewisville Lake area
(Barber 1966, 1969; Harris 1950, 1951a, 1951b). The major result of this work was the discovery
and investigation of the Lewisville Lake site (41DN72), a purported pre-Clovis occupation
(Crook 1964; Crook and Harris 1956, 1957, 1958, 1961). Radiocarbon dates of 37,000 years
before present (B.P.) from 41DN72 created considerable controversy in the archeological
community until 1979–1980, when lowered lake levels allowed reinvestigation of the site and
clarification of the dates by archeologists from the Smithsonian Institution (Stanford 1981).
Further enlargements of Lewisville Lake prompted surveys by the Richland Archeological
Society in 1973 (Nunley 1973) and archeologists from North Texas State University (now the
University of North Texas [UNT]) in 1986 (Lebo and Brown 1990). Test excavations and
mitigation (Ferring and Yates 1997; Lebo 1995a) of selected sites followed. An apparently
unpublished project undertaken by Southern Methodist University archeologists in 1975 resulted
in the recording of several sites near Lewisville Lake.

15

Archeological investigations at Lake Ray Roberts began in the early 1970s with a survey
conducted by crews from Southern Methodist University (Bousman and Verrett 1973) that
recorded 26 sites. During 1980–1981, additional survey, as well as testing and mitigation, was
undertaken by archeologists from Environmental Consultants, Inc. (ECI; Cliff et al. 1982), which
recorded 355 sites. Following the survey, additional investigations undertaken at 60 sites
(Skinner et al. 1982) were followed by intensive excavation at 12 sites, oral interviews for 17
historic-age sites, and architectural recording at 13 sites (Skinner and Baird 1985). Finally, in
1986, UNT crews began further survey, test excavations, and mitigation efforts within the area to
be affected by construction of Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997; Lebo 1992, 1995b,
1996; Prikryl and Yates 1987). The Aubrey Clovis site (41DN479) was discovered
serendipitously in December 1988, when excavation of a channel connecting the new Lake Ray
Roberts spillway to the Elm Fork‘s natural channel produced Pleistocene faunal material in
association with Clovis artifacts (Ferring 1989). Recent investigations there have revealed
cultural deposits dated to 11,550 B.P., among the oldest known in North America (Ferring 2001).
The University of Texas at Arlington field school conducted excavations at the Northlake site on
Grapevine Creek in the mid-1970s (Morgan 1975). More recent investigations at Joe Pool Lake
(Jurney et al. 1988; Peter and McGregor 1988) and the test excavations of the River Bend site,
41TR68 (Peter et al. 1987), provided the initial assemblage data necessary for an understanding
of the adaptations along the West Fork of the Trinity River. In 1991 and 1992, the Texas
Archeological Society (TAS) conducted field school excavations under the direction of staff
members of the THC at several sites in the vicinity of the Sam Kaufman/Arnold Roitsch site
(41RR16) in Red River County, northwest of Wright Patman Lake (Bruseth 1992; Bruseth et al.
1991:1, 6–9; Martin 1992; Prikryl 1992; THC 1991:11–13). This research program included
excavations at the Fasken Mounds site (41RR14), the Ray site (41LR135), Salt Well Slough
(41RR204), and the Kaufman/Roitsch site itself. Also as part of this research effort, survey
operations were conducted within the Big Pine Creek drainage to the west, recording or
rerecording 109 sites (THC 1991:13).
In addition to the above projects, innumerable projects of varying scope have also been
completed in Northcentral Texas; the following account is not exhaustive by any means. In
Collin County a survey of the Clemons Creek watershed project sponsored by the Soil
Conservation Service (SCS) was conducted in 1974 (Hughston and Lynott 1974). In Hunt
County, two projects were sponsored by the SCS in the Lake Fork Creek watershed (Ferring and
Bagot 1974; Hyatt 1974; Skinner 1975b) and Pilot Grove Creek watershed (Lynott 1974;
McCormick and Filson 1977). Investigations initiated by the Texas Water Development Board
were completed for the cities of Renner (Whitsett 1977) and McKinney (Fox 1979) in the late
1970s. A survey of a proposed pipeline route across the northern section of Collin County was
completed in 1981 for Matador Pipelines, Inc. (Peter 1981). In 1984, a survey was sponsored by
the Farmers Electric Cooperative (Skinner 1984). Previous investigations for the North Texas
Municipal Water District (NTMWD) include pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching along the
western perimeter of the federal lands adjoining Lake Lavon, which resulted in the recording of
one prehistoric site (Peter, Cliff, Hunt, and Allday 1990), while similar investigations along the
eastern edge of Lake Lavon also resulted in the recording of one prehistoric site (Hunt et al.
1991). Martin (1988) conducted a survey of proposed highway improvements along IH 35W in
Denton and Tarrant counties. In 1989, UNT crews surveyed Hickory Creek Park for the USACE,
resulting in the location of one historic-age site (Lebo and Brown 1989). In 1991, Mariah
Associates, Inc., undertook a reconnaissance of proposed sewer line improvements for the city of
Argyle (Kibler 1991). During late 1991, Austin and Peter (1992) performed a pedestrian survey
16

of proposed improvements at North Lake Park in the city of Denton. Corbin (1992a) surveyed
the proposed Northpointe Park for the city of The Colony. Investigations concerning the
expansion of the city of McKinney solid waste landfill (Hunt et al. 1992) and a proposed water
pump station (Hunt 1993) have also been conducted for the NTMWD.
During 1993, AR Consultants surveyed the proposed 28-ac Highland Village Community Park
(Skinner 1993). In the same year, Peter and Green (1993) surveyed the proposed South Lakes
Park for the city of Denton. In 1994, Geo-Marine conducted a survey of the proposed SH 190
project area, identifying one new historic-age site (41DL366) and revisiting several others (Hunt
and Peter 1997). Ferring (1995) undertook a survey of 125 acres adjacent to the Lewisville Lake
dam. SWCA, Inc., conducted a pedestrian survey of approximately 8 acres belonging to the
USACE near Grapevine Lake (Miller 1995). Also in 1995, the University of Texas at Austin
conducted a survey of an 800-acre tract along Timber Creek (Carpenter 1995). During late 1994
and early 1995, Hicks & Company performed a pedestrian survey for a 160-acre expansion of the
city of Denton landfill (Treece et al. 1995). A 1996 pedestrian survey of the Arbor Hills Nature
Preserve by AR Consultants resulted in the location of one historic-age site (Skinner and Whorton
1996). Again in 1996, AR Consultants surveyed the Prairie Creek Interceptor for the city of
Lewisville (Trask et al. 1996). In the winter of 1996–1997, AR Consultants surveyed the
proposed FM 2499 at Lewisville Lake (Skinner 1997). Early in 1997, Espey Huston &
Associates, Inc., undertook survey of the Kirkwood Branch Interceptor for the Trinity River
Authority (Tate 1997). In 1998, AR Consultants conducted excavations at the Chinn Chapel
Cemetery Log Cabin, which, like the associated Chinn Chapel and Chinn Chapel Cemetery (both
of which are commemorated with State Historical markers), is located near Copper Canyon
(Skinner 1998). In 1999, Geo-Marine conducted further investigations along the route of the
proposed President George Bush Turnpike (SH 190), locating two previously recorded sites
(41DL240 and 41DL321) as well as a short-term prehistoric habitation site, 41DL391, whose data
potential was exhausted through test excavations (Peter et al. 2001, 2002).
The next year, a survey of a 109-acre reclamation area in the SH 190 corridor identified a
historic-age home site, 41DN394, just west of IH 35 (Hunt 2000); this site was determined to be
ineligible. The same year, AR Consultants identified sites 41DN510 and 41DN513, two historicage wells, in the proposed location of the planned community of Lantana (near Bartonville); the
report apparently remains unpublished. In 2001, Geo-Marine conducted archeological and
geoarcheological investigations of 15 acres along Timber Creek in Lewisville, identifying two
prehistoric sites considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Cooper et al. 2001). Site
41DN518, a historic-age farmstead, was reported by Galan in 2001. In 2002, Geo-Marine
conducted a survey of the proposed location for a new wastewater treatment facility at Panther
Creek, resulting in the identification of two historic-age sites (41DN519 and 41DN520); neither
was recommended for inclusion in the NRHP (Tiné 2002). In late 2002, the area immediately
northeast of the IH 35 crossing of the Elm Fork in Denton County was surveyed and subjected to
geoarcheological investigations by Geo-Marine, in preparation for the proposed T. C. Rice, Jr.,
Athletic Complex; no cultural materials were identified, with the exception of two small historicage localities (Hunt et al. 2002). In 2003, Geo-Marine conducted a survey of the linear 19.9-km
(11.9-mi) pipeline corridor located south of Denton. This survey, which crossed Hickory Creek
in numerous places, identified one prehistoric site and one historic-age locality. An Ellis-type
projectile point was recovered from the prehistoric site, which was located in a disturbed context
on an oil drill pad (Huhnke et al. 2003). Geo-Marine also surveyed a 20.3-km (12.2-mi) segment
of US 380 from the Denton/Wise county line to its intersection at IH 35 (Huhnke 2004). In
February of 2004, Geo-Marine surveyed a 51.5-km (32.2-mi) segment of IH 35 from IH 635 to
17

US 380 in Denton, resulting in the identification of three ineligible historic-age sites (Largent,
Huhnke, and Wurtz 2004). Later that year, Geo-Marine surveyed a 220-acre parcel on the
northeast corner of the intersection of IH 35 and the SH 121 bypass, locating the remains of two
previously recorded sites as well as one large, deeply buried Archaic site, 41DN529 (Largent,
Lintz, and Huhnke 2004).
Between 2000 and 2007, Geo-Marine completed 158 work authorizations under five TxDOT
contracts for the Atlanta, Dallas, Lufkin, Paris, and Tyler districts (Allday and Bastis 2008;
Largent et al. 2005; Phillips et al. 2007; Peukert et al. 2003; Wurtz et al. 2006). These work
authorizations consisted of multiple tasks involving primarily impact evaluations and
archeological surveys, along with several site testing projects, undertaken for various road and
bridge construction, widening, and rehabilitation projects. These investigations recorded or
revisited 105 sites along multiple federal, state, county, and farm-to-market roads and highways.
In addition to the work conducted by Geo-Marine, numerous other surveys have been conducted
in the Atlanta, Dallas, Lufkin, Paris, and Tyler districts. These surveys ranged in size from less
than an acre to more than 1,000 acres, resulting in the investigation of well over 100 sites (THC
2007).

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The following brief discussion of the prehistoric archeological record of Northeast Texas draws
from previous summaries by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), Perttula (1988a), Story (1981, 1985,
1990), and Thurmond (1985, 1988, 1990). Similarly, discussion of the archeology of
Northcentral Texas (especially for the upper Trinity River basin) derives from four major reports:
Peter and McGregor (1988), Prikryl (1987, 1990), and Yates and Ferring (1986). Although the
cultural sequences are similar, they are by no means identical, especially for Northeast Texas.
Indeed, due to what appears to be increasing regional differentiation through time, the cultural
sequences for the Great Bend Region (including Wright Patman Lake) and the western Cypress
Creek basin (including Lake O‘ the Pines) diverge in the Caddoan period. The generalized
cultural sequences for the Northcentral and Northeast Texas culture areas (Figure 4) are presented
in Table 1, and presented separately in the subsequent discussions.

Northeast Texas
This discussion concerning Northeast Texas applies to the Atlanta, Tyler, and Lufkin TxDOT
districts; the Northcentral Texas discussion applies to the Dallas and Paris districts. As indicated
in Table 1, the Native American cultural sequence for Northcentral Texas is quite different from
that of Northeast Texas. The only period of overlap appears to be the Paleo-Indian period, which
occurred before significant regional differentiation took place at the end of the Pleistocene; thus,
the Paleo-Indian discussion is equally applicable to Northeast and Northcentral Texas. Both
periods experienced a lengthy Archaic period as well, but it lasted much longer in Northcentral
Texas than in Northeast Texas, and the recognized cultures are not entirely the same.

Paleo-Indian Period
Although a pre-Clovis occupation of the New World had long been suggested (Adovasio et al.
1990; Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990; McGahey n.d.;
Meltzer 1989), it was not until the excavations at the Monte Verde site in Chile that the evidence
for a pre-12,000 B.P. occupation has been widely accepted. Within the southern and southeastern
United States, however, the evidence for a pre-Clovis occupation remains disputed, and thus the
Paleo-Indian period remains the earliest recognized human occupation in Texas.
The Paleo-Indian period across the entire North Texas region (ca. 9500–7000 B.C.) generally
includes those remains of human presence that can be dated to the very late Pleistocene and the
immediate post-Pleistocene periods (for recent reviews of this period in North Texas, see Johnson
1989; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1990). As a matter of convenience, the period can
be subdivided into an early Paleo-Indian period (ca. 9500–8500 B.C.) and a late Paleo-Indian
period (8500–7000 B.C.).

20

In Northeast Texas, numerous diagnostic projectile points, such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
Scottsbluff, and San Patrice, have been recovered as isolated surface finds or excavated in later
contexts (Carley n.d.; Perttula 1988a:17), but unfortunately, few Paleo-Indian sites in good
stratigraphic context have been found (Perttula 1988a:17; Preston 1972, 1974), and fewer have
received any sort of systematic excavation. Both Perttula and Story note the possible presence of
horizontally stratified early Paleo-Indian deposits at the Forrest Murphey site (41MR62) at Lake
O‘ the Pines, but the site was reportedly destroyed by dam construction before being excavated
(Perttula 1988a:17; Perttula et al. 1986:47; Story 1990:184–185). The situation of the Murphey
site and the discovery of the deeply buried Clovis-aged Aubrey site (41DN479) along the Elm
Fork of the Trinity River in Northcentral Texas (Ferring 1989, 1990, 2001) suggest that wellpreserved Paleo-Indian sites in Northeast Texas will only be found by examining deeply stratified
Pleistocene terraces or by penetrating more recent Holocene Alluvium in modern floodplains.
Despite the lack of good data relating to the early Paleo-Indian period in Northeast Texas, some
attempts have been made to generalize regarding settlement mobility and intensity of site
occupation, drawing on the limited data that are known and on assumptions based on
comparisons with other areas. For instance, a number of researchers have seen evidence for a
high degree of group mobility in the broad distribution of Paleo-Indian artifacts over the
landscape and in the variety of presumably nonlocal lithic raw materials from which they were
made (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Shafer 1977; Story 1990:177). Likewise, the well-documented
exploitation of large megafauna by Paleo-Indians in the western United States, coupled with the
known presence of similar species in Northeast Texas between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago (see
Hemmings 1983; Slaughter and Hoover 1963), has resulted in the popular conclusion that ―big
game hunting‖ was part of the Paleo-Indian subsistence strategy in Northeast Texas. Although a
possible association between a Clovis point and mastodon remains at the Murphey site (Story
1990:185) does support this likelihood, increasing evidence from sites to the west (such as the
Aubrey site) suggests that Paleo-Indian groups were less dependent upon ―big game hunting‖
than has been assumed in the past.
The late Paleo-Indian period in Northeast Texas appears to be distinguished by the divergence of
the earlier, widespread fluted point tradition into several distinct subtraditions. The first of these
includes Scottsbluff, Plainview, and similar lanceolate points that appear to be part of a more
western or ―plains-derived‖ subtradition in terms of origin and style; the second includes Dalton
and Dalton-related projectile points that have a wide distribution throughout the wooded
southeastern and midwestern United States. Some researchers have suggested that this Dalton
horizon represents an adaptation to the changing environment at the end of the Pleistocene
(Goodyear 1982:389–391), a view that has found some support in the addition of the Dalton adze,
a presumed ―heavy, woodworking tool,‖ to what otherwise is viewed as a Paleo-Indian tool kit
(Kelley et al. 1988:21). San Patrice, an important complex that may be related to Dalton, is found
in eastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, and southern Arkansas and is
characterized by San Patrice and Keithville points, and Albany scrapers (Ensor 1987; Schambach
1979; Webb et al. 1971).

Archaic Period
With the end of the Ice Age, the prehistoric residents of the region began to develop into localized
populations of efficient hunter-gatherers, exploiting localized resource bases. This period, and
the subsistence pattern that characterizes it, has become known as the Archaic. The Archaic
21

represents a long period of time that was characterized by only gradual and minor changes in
subsistence patterns, lithic technology, and projectile point styles and was apparently a period of
strong cultural stability. Archaic populations are usually portrayed as generalized hunters and
gatherers with more limited geographic ranges than the preceding Paleo-Indian peoples. At the
present time, there is no evidence for the development of local cultigens during the Archaic
period in Texas, although this is not the case for the Ozark Highlands and other parts of the
eastern United States.
The Archaic period in Northeast Texas is tentatively dated between 7000 and 200 B.C. As is true
for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of Early, Middle, and Late
subperiods, has been applied in Northeast Texas. Although reliable dating for the Archaic period
in this area of Texas is virtually nonexistent, these divisions have been given tentative dates based
on better-dated sites in surrounding areas. Thus, the Early Archaic has been dated from 7000 to
4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to 2000 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 2000 to 200
B.C. (overviews that cover the Archaic in this portion of Texas include Fields and Tomka 1993;
Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1985, 1990). Archaic remains are usually found in
upland settings and are frequently mixed with later material (Campbell et al. 1983; Story 1981).
General trends that have been proposed as characterizing the Archaic period in Northeast Texas
include an increasingly complex settlement system, increasing population size and density,
increasing sedentism, and the development of distinct group territories (Perttula 1988a:17; Story
1985:52). Despite these changes, however, no evidence of any level of food production (even
incipient production) has been reported from any Northeast Texas Archaic site (Perttula
1988a:17; Story 1990:Table 56), in spite of the fact that definite steps toward food production
were being taken elsewhere in the eastern United States (Ford 1985:347–349; Watson 1988).
During the Early Archaic (ca. 7000–4000 B.C.), the occurrence of small and widely distributed
sites has been suggested to reflect high group mobility within large and poorly defined territories
and based on a generalized hunting and gathering economy (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Story
1985:35, 39). Projectile point forms that may be associated with the Early Archaic in Northeast
Texas include Kirk, Keithville, Palmer, Cossatot, Dawson, and Wells (Story 1990; Thurmond
1990).
In comparison to the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic period (4000–2000 B.C.) appears to be
characterized by (1) an increased diversity of tool types; (2) greater interregional variability; (3)
the addition of ground, pecked, and polished stone tools; and (4) an increased use of plant foods
as indicated by the addition of mortars, pestles, and milling stones (Neuman 1984:77, 79). The
dependence upon abundant forest resources (e.g., oak mast production, deer, and small mammals)
that are evenly distributed over most of the region probably resulted in evenly distributed
population densities and favored the development of exclusive or ―fixed‖ territories (Plog and
Upham 1983:202; Story 1985:41). Although grinding stones apparently were introduced during
the Early Archaic period, it was not until the Middle Archaic that their use became widespread.
Grinding and polishing were used to produce grooved axes, atlatl weights, and ground stone
pendants during that period. Diagnostic dart points that may be associated with the Middle
Archaic include Big Sandy, Calf Creek, Johnson, Carrollton, Morrill, Evans, Lone Oak, Trinity,
and Wesley (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990).
Population density may have reached a peak during the Late Archaic period in Northeast Texas
(ca. 2000–200 B.C.) as evidenced by an apparent increase in the number of sites, a greater
distribution of sites over the landscape, and evidence of increasing degrees of sedentism. At the
22

same time, group mobility may have become more limited and interregional contact may have
become much more common. If the greater spatial dispersal of sites is not a result of sampling
error due to unequal destruction or burial of earlier sites, it may reflect an economic system with
increasing reliance on all available floral and faunal resources, although the economic data to
support this view are generally absent. Throughout Northeast Texas, Late Archaic period sites
are relatively common in the uplands, and a number are known from the floodplain of the Red
River as well as Late Archaic components in sites to the south near Lake Sam Rayburn in the
Neches/Angelina river area (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993), but no regional phases have yet been
identified (Schambach 1982a:3–6). Dart points that may be diagnostic of the Late Archaic
include Lange, Castroville, Ellis, Palmillas, Edgewood, Yarbrough, Ensor, and Kent (Story 1990;
Thurmond 1990).

Early Ceramic Period
The Early Ceramic period (200 B.C.–A.D. 800) in Northeast Texas is generally not well defined
and is largely identified by similarities in pottery and projectile points with sites of the Fourche
Maline tradition north of the Red River (recent overviews that provide good information for this
period include Perttula et al. 1993; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1990). Diagnostic
artifacts consist of coarse plainware ceramics, tempered with either clay/grog or bone, and Gary
projectile points. The ceramics generally are grouped together as Williams Plain; but given the
wide range of temporal and spatial variability present, they should probably be viewed as one or
more undefined varieties of that type. Discounting ceramic differences at the varietal level, the
remains of the Early Ceramic period in Northeast Texas seem to be most closely related to
Schambach‘s (1982b:188, 1998) Fourche Maline tradition in Arkansas. Despite other similarities
to Fourche Maline, however, no Early Ceramic period burial mounds are known in the Texas
portion of the Great Bend. The few that are known in East Texas occur to the south in the Sabine
and Neches river basins around the Toledo Bend and Sam Rayburn reservoir areas (see Story
1990:Figure 41) at the Coral Snake (16SA48; on the eastern edge of Toledo Bend in Louisiana)
and Jonas Short (41SA101) mound sites (Jensen 1968; McClurkan et al. 1966, 1980). The lack of
such evidence in Northeast Texas leaves open the question of whether or not this area was
undergoing the same processes of cultural evolution presumably responsible for the development
of burial mound use elsewhere (see Perttula 1988a:18; Story 1990).
Perttula (1988a:18) has noted what appears to be a major presence of Early Ceramic period
occupation within the Sulphur River basin, although this may be more the result of intensity of
research or factors of site preservation rather than the actual presence of a large Early Ceramic
population. In regard to modeling settlement patterns during this period, Perttula (1988a:18)
suggests that ―Early Ceramic or Fourche Maline settlements are . . . represented by villages and
hamlets in the floodplains or terraces of larger streams, and by smaller components in the
uplands.‖ Many of the sites on which Perttula bases this model, including Snipes at Wright
Patman Lake (Jelks 1961) and Tick, Thomas, Hurricane Hill, and Lawson at Cooper Lake
(Doehner and Larson 1978; Martin 1996a, 1996b; Perttula 1990), contain middens that are taken
as indicating a more sedentary settlement pattern than that of the preceding Archaic period. Two
apparent pits (Features 1 and 2) radiocarbon dated to the Early Ceramic period (1,460 ± 60 B.P.
and 2,090 ± 30 B.P., respectively) at 41HP137 at Cooper Lake yielded hickory nut, acorn, wild
tubers (possibly the prairie turnip, Pediomelum or Psoralea sp.), and what may be fragments of
cultivated squash or gourd (Fields et al. 1994:12; McGregor 1996:357).

23

Elsewhere in Northeast Texas, sandy paste ceramics (cf., Bear Creek Plain and Goose Creek
Plain) appear to be common on Early Ceramic period sites south of the Sabine River (Story
1981:146) along the upper reaches of the Angelina and Neches rivers, as well as farther south in
the Sam Rayburn and Toledo Bend reservoir areas. This pottery is technologically different from
the ceramics in the northern area of Northeast Texas. Many of the sites south of the Sabine (e.g.,
Deshazo [41NA27] and George C. Davis [41CE19], as well as Wolfshead [41SA117], Runnells 1
and 2 [41SA87 and SA86], and Dubose [41SA100] in the Sam Rayburn Reservoir area) exhibit
ceramics attributed to the Mossy Grove tradition (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:262, 233; Story
1990:277]). The indigenous Mossy Grove hunter-gatherer population was likely pushed
southward by Caddo groups at the end of the period (ca. A.D. 800/900) (Story 1990:256). Lithics
from these more southerly sites are predominantly the Kent and Gary dart point styles, along with
―rather nondescript bifaces . . . [that may represent] projectile point manufacture failures‖ and
some unifaces (Story 1990:256). Toward the middle Early Ceramic period (ca. A.D. 500–600),
the bow and arrow technology, along with the Friley arrow point, likely was introduced into the
more southeastern Texas region (Story 1990:256).

Caddo Period in the Great Bend-Neches/Angelina Regions
The Formative (A.D. 800–1000) and Early Caddo (A.D. 1000–1200) periods in the Great BendNeches/Angelina regions are not well defined. Ceramics for both of these periods include
Hickory Fine Engraved, Carmel Engraved, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, and Pennington
Punctated-Incised (Thurmond 1990:Table 8). Thurmond has further distinguished between
equivalents of these two periods on the basis of the presence of Davis Incised, Holly Fine
Engraved, Kiam Incised, Spiro Engraved, and Weches Fingernail Impressed in the earlier (along
with some late varieties of Coles Creek types), and of Canton Incised, Haley Engraved, Maxey
Noded Redware, Sanders Engraved, and Sanders Plain in the later, although some researchers are
more inclined to put the latter four types in the Middle Caddoan period.
The Formative and Early Caddoan periods are characterized by what may best be termed the Alto
complex or Alto sphere, a widespread manifestation related to the Alto phase, originally defined
at the George C. Davis site in Cherokee County, Texas, south of the Great Bend area (Newell and
Krieger 1949). The Alto complex shows strong influence from Coles Creek to the east and
appears to partially overlap it in time. It also, however, shows a number of new characteristics
(Neuman 1970), including new projectile point types (i.e., Hayes and Homan arrow points), new
ceramic vessel forms (i.e., the carinated bowl and the bottle), and a new mode of vessel
decoration (i.e., fine engraving with red pigment filler).
Perttula (1988a:18) has suggested that these and other cultural innovations, including the
introduction of the bow and arrow ca. A.D. 800 and increased food production based on maize, led
to increases in population and sociopolitical complexity during these periods. The settlement
system became increasingly complex, apparently involving sedentary villages and farmsteads,
special function sites (what Binford [1980] has called logistical camps), and mound centers that
were presumably ritual or ceremonial in function (see Perttula 1988a:18–19). A number of such
mound centers dating to the Formative and Early Caddo periods occur in Northeast Texas and
include the T. M. Coles or Mustang Creek Mound (Jackson 1931) on a tributary of the Sulphur
River to the west of Wright Patman Lake, and several mounds at the lake itself (Stephenson
1950). Many more mound sites occur along the Red River and its immediate tributaries to the
north (Banks 1983; Miller 1986; Taylor 1949). To the south, the Bivins-Flanagan mound (also
24

known as Hudnall-Pirtle; 41RK4) on the middle Sabine River is a major multiple mound site with
six to eight mounds, a plaza, and a habitation area (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:129). The
George C. Davis site in Cherokee County on the Neches River may be the best representative of
the mound center-village site type, another characteristic of the Alto focus. The Early Caddoan
component of this site likely indicates an emigrant group from the middle Sabine River area
(possibly Bivins-Flanagan?) arriving prior to ca. A.D. 900 (Story 1990:325).
The Middle Caddo period (A.D. 1200–1400) in the Great Bend region includes what is known as
the Haley phase, the definition of which is based generally on mortuary data, largely from C. B.
Moore‘s excavations at the Haley site (3MI1) in Arkansas (Moore 1912). The Haley phase
appears to represent a development out of the earlier Alto complex, and among the continuities
from the earlier period is the use of shaft grave burials for some members of the society who were
accompanied into the afterlife by relatively rich grave offerings (Kelley et al. 1988:26). This
phase was centered in the Great Bend area in Arkansas, but northwestern Louisiana and
northeastern Texas also fall within its peripheral influence. A Haley phase component has been
recognized at the Hatchel site in Bowie County (Davis 1970:44), and other Haley components are
known in the area, including the Cabe Mounds site (Perttula et al. 1995) and the Mitchell site
(Cliff et al. 1997). Coker Mound (41CS1) also apparently has a Haley phase component, based
on radiocarbon dates and a reported Haley Engraved bottle in a mortuary feature (Perttula,
Turner, and Nelson 1997:17–20). Despite its presence in Texas, however, the Haley phase was
apparently most fully elaborated in the Arkansas portion of the Great Bend.
Most of the well-known Haley phase components, especially in Arkansas, relate to mound
centers, although it is unclear whether all of them were associated with villages (Wyckoff 1974).
One well-investigated nonmound habitation site is known from Arkansas, apparently a small
farmstead located on ―a natural levee‖ or ―high ground overlooking riverine bottom lands‖
(Wyckoff 1974:106, 113). The site contained two circular house structures and a small trash
dump and has suggested to some that the Haley phase settlement pattern involved small,
dispersed farmsteads surrounding vacant ceremonial centers (Hoffman 1970). Wyckoff
(1974:107) also notes, however, the existence of mound centers with ―potentially large villages,‖
as well as nonmound cemeteries located close to mound centers. Finally, he states that:
[t]here is certainly an overall tendency for the Haley components, mound centers and non-mound
habitation areas alike, to associate with a riverine valley setting. Most of the mound centers did occur
in the valleys of major streams, but [some mound centers] were on the floodplains of streams
tributary to the major rivers [Wyckoff 1974:112].

In regard to sociopolitical organization within Haley phase society, the complexity of the
mortuary ceremonialism and apparent status ranking evident in the burials recovered from Haley
phase sites, as well as the presumed organizational control necessary to construct the mound
centers, strongly suggest that there was ―a political and religious hierarchy that operated
throughout the Haley Focus [sic] society‖ (Wyckoff 1974:110).
In the Sabine River area, the Oak Hill Village site (41RK214) in Rusk County (Rogers and
Perttula 2004), Washington Square (41NA49) in Nacogdoches County, Tyson (41SY92) in the
Attoyac River basin in Shelby County are among the major mound centers dating to the Early–
Middle Caddo period (Perttula 2000:24–25). Data from these sites suggest a horticultural
lifestyle based on maize and squash, supplemented by wild seeds, nuts, and tubers, along with
fishing and continued hunting of deer and other game. Mounds were used both as temple and
25

burial sites, and the larger centers were important civic-ceremonial areas. Many of the large
mound centers contained structures and plazas along with storage/granary structures and pits.
The distribution of the mound centers suggests an integrated society of rather complex sociopolitical extent. The Washington Square mound, securely dated to A.D. 1268 and 1302, was built
at the crossroads between aboriginal trails (later known as the east–west Caddo Trace and the
north–south Camino Real) and may have been primarily a ceremonial center since little indication
of permanent habitation has been documented. Radiocarbon dates also suggest the possibility
that Washington Square was the successor to George C. Davis, which was essentially abandoned
by the early fourteenth century (Perttula 2000:24–29).
Material culture reflects corner-notched and rectangular-stemmed arrow points, celts, Gahagan
bifaces, scrapers, and borer/perforators, as well as ceramic pipes, earspools, and figurines. The
decorated carinated, boat-shaped, cylindrical, and globular bowls and jars; bottles; plates and
platters; and ollas ceramics, however, are the most distinctive cultural items. These ceramics
were used for various food-related tasks—cooking, serving, storage—as well as for use as
personal items and ceremonial beakers in mortuary occasions (Perttula 2000:26–27).
The Late Caddo period (A.D. 1400–1680) includes the final part of the prehistoric period and the
initial years of European contact (for an overview of this period and the subsequent Historic
Caddo period, see Perttula 1992). The survivors of the de Soto entrada apparently entered
Northeast Texas about midway through the Late Caddo period, the latter part of which appears to
have overlapped with the initial movements of seventeenth-century European explorers and
traders into northeastern Texas.
In the lower Sulphur River basin, two archeological complexes have been defined for the Late
Caddo period, the Titus phase and the Texarkana phase (Schambach 1982a; Thurmond 1985).
The Titus phase appears to be centered between the Sabine and Sulphur rivers in the Northeast
Texas piney woods and post-oak savanna. The Texarkana phase is located in the upper portion of
the Great Bend of the Red River and extends southward to include a portion of the lower Sulphur
River drainage (Wyckoff 1974:Figure 4). The definition of the Texarkana phase is based largely
on WPA excavations conducted at the Hatchel mound and at the Mitchell and Moores cemeteries
situated on the Red River northwest of Texarkana (Davis 1970:50–51). Texarkana phase sites,
such as Sherwin on the lower Sulphur River, probably existed as satellites to these larger,
permanent settlements on the Red River (Perttula 1988a).
Both the Titus and Texarkana phases appear to be characterized by small hamlets or farmsteads
that were probably occupied by small family groups of shifting agriculturalists. These farmsteads
were apparently characterized by a limited number of structures and a small family cemetery (see
Brewington and Dockall 1991; Brewington et al. 1995; Jelks 1961; Perttula 1988a; and Wormser
1988). They presumably were associated with larger, more permanent suprahousehold sites,
including both mound centers and nonmound cemeteries, which served to integrate the scattered
households into a unified social group.
In the Neches/Angelina river basin, the Frankston (A.D. 1400–1650) and Angelina (post-A.D.
1450/1500) phases are dominant. In this area, there is a noticeable lack of Late Caddo large
mound burials after ca. A.D. 1400. Additionally, the lack of elaborate burials, especially as
indicated at the George C. Davis site, may indicate a decline in organizational hierarchy (Story
1990:340). The Frankston phase A. C. Saunders site (41AN19) near the Neches River in
Anderson County is the only known mound site. Frankston phase habitation sites consist
26

primarily of farmsteads, hamlets, and small villages (Perttula 2000:31) and many cluster along
the upper Neches River (Anderson 1972:163). Burials tend to be in small (possibly) family or
village cemeteries of less than 10 individuals, with many interments containing ceramic grave
goods. To the south near Sam Rayburn Reservoir, the Angelina focus sites yielded ceramic
elbow pipes, and brushed and punctated ceramics. Perdiz arrow points, conch shell beads, bone
tools, and worked bone artifacts have been recovered from burials at the Walter Bell site
(41SB50) in Sabine County (Jelks 1965:56–60). In the Toledo Bend Reservoir area in Sabine and
Shelby counties, Late Caddo residential settlements exhibit extensive middens and small
cemeteries that were contemporaneous with Angelina phase sites to the west (Perttula 2000:32).

Caddo Period in the Big Cypress Creek Basin
The time span between the Archaic and the Caddo period (i.e., the Early Ceramic from ca. 200
B.C.–A.D. 800) in the Cypress Creek basin is poorly represented, but Caddo habitation of the
period subsequent to ca. A.D. 800 is well documented. The Caddo period in the Cypress Creek
basin has been subdivided into early, middle, and late subperiods: the Early Caddo from ca. A.D.
800 to 1300, the Middle Caddo from ca. A.D. 1300 to 1400, and the Late Caddo from A.D. 1400 to
1680 (see Thurmond 1990:39–40). Thurmond‘s (1990) Early Caddo period includes components
related to the Alto and Sanders foci and is subdivided into two parts. Ceramic types characteristic
of Period 1 (A.D. 800–1100) include Holly Fine Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Spiro
Engraved, Kiam Incised, Weches Fingernail Impressed, and Coles Creek Incised; Williams Plain
ceramics also are found. During Period 2 (A.D. 1100–1300), ceramic types shift to Sanders
Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Sanders Plain, and Canton Incised; Williams Plain makes up a
smaller part of the assemblage than previously. Arrow points for the Early Caddo period as a
whole include Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, and Scallorn (Thurmond 1990:226–227).
The Middle Caddo period in the western Cypress Creek basin is seen as being transitional from
the Early Caddo Period 2 to the Late Caddo Whelan phase. Thurmond identifies only 14 sites for
this period, all of which are found in the upper reaches of Big Cypress Creek. Ceramic types
identified for this period include Ripley Engraved, Avery Engraved, Canton Incised, Maydelle
Incised, Bullard Brushed, Pease Brushed-Incised, and La Rue Neck-Banded. Projectile point
types found during this period are Bonham, Catahoula, Alba, Perdiz, and Clifton (Thurmond
1990:227–228).
The eastern and western portions of the Cypress Creek basin show distinct differences in material
culture during the Late Caddoan period, with a dividing line close to the western end of Caddo
Lake. In the eastern side of the basin, the Late Caddoan period includes the Bossier and Belcher
phases, while in the western side of the basin are the Whelan (A.D. 1350–1430) and Titus (A.D.
1430–1680) phases. Thurmond (1990) labels the western group the Cypress cluster. He believes
this represents the formation of a distinct social group, equivalent to the Kadohadacho and
Hasinai confederacies known ethnographically (Thurmond 1985).
The Whelan phase is the earlier temporal phase identified for the Cypress cluster. Engraved
ceramics from Whelan phase sites consist primarily of Ripley Engraved, with smaller amounts of
Taylor Engraved and Wilder Engraved. Motifs observed on Ripley Engraved ceramics include
the scroll, scroll and circle, alternating nested triangle, horizontal diamond, and bisected diamond,
with the border elements usually being filled with curvilinear hatchures. Utility wares from this
period are significantly different from Early Caddo utility wares. Body sherds are about equally
27

divided between brushed and plain ceramics, while other treatments, such as incising, punctation,
fingernail-impressed, and red-filming, become minor parts of the assemblage. Brushed ceramics
are about equally divided between Bullard Brushed and Pease Brushed-Incised; plain-bodied
vessels are primarily classified as Maydelle Incised, and La Rue Neck-Banded pottery is
uncommon. Arrow points typical of this period are Perdiz and Scallorn (Thurmond 1990:228).
The succeeding Titus phase represents the final prehistoric occupation of the upper Cypress
Creek basin. The engraved ceramics are still dominated by Ripley Engraved, although Taylor
Engraved and Wilder Engraved are more common than in the Whelan phase, and two new types,
Bailey Engraved and Johns Engraved, appear. A new motif for Ripley Engraved, the pendant
triangle, appears to be limited to this phase. Border elements change from the curvilinear
hatchures of the Whelan phase to broad, deeply excised areas. Specialized ceramics, such as
Killough Pinched jars, zoomorphic effigy bowls, and noded rattle bowls, become more common
during the Titus phase. Utility wares also underwent significant change from the preceding
period. Brushed ceramics are reduced in frequency compared to the Whelan phase, and a new
decorative element, appliqué, is introduced. Pease Brushed-Incised virtually disappears from the
assemblage, while Maydelle Incised is found in slightly reduced frequencies as compared to the
Whelan phase, and La Rue Neck-Banded remains constant. Two new types, Harleton Appliqué
and a type similar to McKinney Plain, are introduced during this period. Extensive trade contacts
with the McCurtain phase to the north are indicated by the occurrence of Avery Engraved, Bowie
Engraved, Cass Appliqué, and Simms Engraved ceramics at Titus phase sites. Similar contacts
with the Belcher phase to the east appear to be limited to the adjacent sites of the Titus phase.
Perdiz and Scallorn arrow points continue into the Titus phase, and Bassett, Maud, Reed, and
Talco points are introduced (Thurmond 1990:228–229).
Thurmond (1990:229–233) has defined four regional subclusters within the Titus phase—Three
Basins, Tankersley Creek, Swauano Creek, and Big Cypress Creek. These subclusters are
hypothesized to represent discrete social groups. The Big Cypress Creek subcluster is
concentrated at Lake O‘ the Pines, with two outliers found to the south along Little Cypress
Creek and the Sabine River. Engraved ceramics characteristic of this subcluster consist primarily
of Ripley Engraved and Taylor Engraved, with relatively insignificant amounts of Bailey
Engraved, Johns Engraved, and Wilder Engraved. Decorative motifs seen on Ripley Engraved
ceramics are mostly of the pendant triangle type, although the scroll, scroll and circle, and circle
and continuous scroll are not uncommon. Bullard Brushed and Karnack Brushed-Incised are the
dominant types of utilitarian ceramics, and Harleton Appliqué, Maydelle Incised, and the
McKinney Plain-like ceramics are less common than in the other subclusters. Belcher phase
trade vessels are also present, especially at the easternmost sites. The primary arrow point is the
Talco, although Maud and Bassett points are also present.
The Titus phase is somewhat imprecisely dated from ca. A.D. 1450 to perhaps as late as A.D. 1680
(Perttula 1992; Thurmond 1990). This evidence includes the reputed recovery by a private
collector of glass beads from a burial at the Tracey site (41CP71), which is a part of the Big
Cypress subcluster, and the discovery of the Wichita ceramic types Womack Engraved and
Womack Plain from the Culpepper (41HP1) and the W. A. Ford (41TT2) sites of the Three
Basins subcluster (Scurlock 1962; Thurmond 1990:233). Thurmond (1990:233) believes that,
considering the large number of Titus phase burials investigated over the years, the dearth of
historic-age material indicates a real decline in the Titus phase and an abandonment of the
western Cypress Creek basin prior to the beginning of the Historic period.

28

Thurmond‘s (1990:233) reconstruction is that the people represented by the Cypress cluster were
reduced by disease in the Protohistoric period, with the result that, by the time the Spanish and
French became permanently established in the area, the upper Cypress Creek basin had been
abandoned. He identifies the Cypress cluster with the Lacane, a group visited by the de Soto
expedition in 1542. The Spanish exposed the Lacane to a variety of diseases to which they had
no resistance. Such diseases have been suggested to have had significant impacts upon other
groups in the Southeast (Dobyns 1983; Dye 1989; Murray 1989:49; Perttula 1993; Perttula et al.
1986:186–189; Smith 1989). Following this episode, the remnants of the Lacane left the area and
took refuge with the Hasinai and/or the Kadohadacho confederacies.

Historic Native American Period—Northeast Texas
The Historic Caddo period (A.D. 1680–1860) in Northeast Texas began with the founding by
René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, of a short-lived French colony on the Texas coast and
ended with the expulsion of the Caddo from Texas in 1859. During the closing decades of the
seventeenth century, French explorers (including the Sieur de Tonti, Bienville, and St. Denis)
traveled through the upper Red River valley and made contact with the Native Americans
residing in the area. The primary Native American groups inhabiting the Great BendNeches/Angelina river regions at that time consisted of Caddoan speakers, presumably
descendants of groups that had inhabited the area at least as far back as A.D. 800. These Caddoan
populations were divided very generally into the Kadohadacho in the Great Bend area north of
the Sulphur River, and the Hasinai in the Neches/Angelina River region south of the Sabine
River.
The groups in the northern area comprised the Kadohadacho Confederacy (Swanton 1946:141).
The confederacy was originally composed of five groups—the Kadohadacho, the Petit Caddo, the
Upper Natchitoches, the Upper Nasoni, and the Nanatsoho. According to Williams (1974:286),
the Upper Yatasi and the Cahinnio joined the confederacy at a later time, possibly in the early
eighteenth century in the case of the Cahinnio and in the 1760s in the case of the Yatasi. The
confederacy apparently controlled the entire Texas portion of the Great Bend region. Don
Domingo Terán de los Rios, who in 1692 visited one of the Kadohadacho villages located just
above the Great Bend of the Red River near present-day Texarkana (Swanton 1946:57), noted
that their power extended as far south as Big Cypress Bayou (Hackney 1966:3). The origin of the
confederacy is unknown at present, but it may have arisen as a result of what was probably a
severe demographic impact resulting from the de Soto entrada (cf., Smith 1989).
The Kadohadacho were a relatively sedentary group and suffered no severe displacement until the
Apache, Osage, and Kichai intruded into their areas in the early nineteenth century. Moderate
amounts of data are available from early European and Euro-American visits to the area. Two
archeological phases, the Little River and Chakanina, appear to fall within this early Historic
period in the Great Bend region (Kelley et al. 1988:27). Although the Little River phase was
originally proposed as the archeological remains of the entire Kadohadacho Confederacy, the
phase has become linked with the Roseborough Lake–Hatchel/Mitchell/Moores site complex
(41BW2/3/4/5) associated with the Upper Nasoni in Bowie County and several other sites
(Schambach 1982a). Ceramics from the Roseborough Lake–Hatchell/Mitchell/Moores complex
consist of trailed, engraved, neck-banded, and plain types. Historic-age glass beads and metal
fragments have also been recovered from the complex (Story 1990:348). The Chakanina phase
has been defined mostly on the assemblage from the Cedar Grove site (3LA97) in Arkansas
29

(Schambach 1982a). Schambach believes this phase to represent the Kadohadacho proper and
excludes the closely associated Upper Nasoni, Upper Natchitoches, and the Nanatsoho groups.
Ceramics are decorated with engraving, incising, and appliqué. Much of the utility ware is shelltempered.
The introduction of European diseases severely reduced the Caddo groups even though
widespread contact was restricted until the 1700s. The loss of population likely resulted in
emigration from the Sulphur River area, possibly leaving only enclaves along major trails and
portages such as the Nasoni portage in Bowie County (Peter and Cliff 1990a:33). Between 1788
and 1790, the groups of the Kadohadacho Confederacy were forced south into Louisiana by the
severity of raids by the Osage (Smith 1995:82–83; Williams 1974:297). At that time, they settled
with the Petit Caddo, near Caddo Lake on Cypress Creek, about 35 miles west of the main branch
of the Red River (Smith 1995:83), where they were encountered by Freeman and Custis in 1806
(Flores 1984:16, fn 3). In the Caddo Treaty of 1835, the Kadohadacho sold their land in the
United States and agreed to leave the country within one year (Smith 1995:122; Williams
1974:309); but as late as 1840, one band remained in the Caddo Lake area, possibly in the same
village, which was along the Louisiana-Texas border (Smith 1995:143–146). In 1841, this band
joined the rest of the Kadohadacho in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) north of the Red
River (Smith 1995:146). The rest of the Caddo remained in Texas, but by 1855, they were
residing, along with other Native American groups, on a tract of land on the Brazos River in
Northcentral Texas. Subsequently, they were moved north to Indian Territory in 1859 (Swanton
1946:99).
After the abandonment of the Great Bend region by the Kadohadacho, groups of displaced Native
Americans from east of the Mississippi River began to move into Caddo territory in Spanish
Texas. These movements were in response to the increasing pressure to give up their traditional
livelihoods and become incorporated into Anglo-American culture (Everett 1990). The Spanish
initially welcomed these groups with the idea of using them to create a ―buffer‖ between the
Spanish settlements in Texas and the land-hungry Anglo-Americans. Unfortunately, as more of
these groups (such as the Choctaw, Delaware, Quapaw, Shawnee, Cherokee, and AlabamaKoasati) moved into East Texas, they began increasingly to compete with the Caddo for a
diminishing resource base. This problem was exacerbated following the sale of Louisiana to the
United States in 1803, when Anglo-Americans began moving into Northeast Texas as well
(Perttula 1988a:21), and was not ultimately resolved until both the Caddo and most of the
immigrant groups were expelled following the Texas Revolution of 1835.
In the Neches/Angelina river region, the Hasinai Caddo likely encountered Europeans first in
1542 when the remnants of the Spanish Hernando de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso
Alvarado, entered their territory. Their next contact with Europeans occurred in 1686 when the
Frenchman La Salle stayed several days in the Hasinai village of Cenis while searching for the
Mississippi (Story 1982). The Hasinai, whose cultural area was centered on the middle Neches
and upper Angelina river valleys, were the most socially advanced and influential group in the
region. The largest of the Hasinai residential/ceremonial centers has been found at the George C.
Davis site (41CE19) in Cherokee County. Another important center has been identified at the
Deshazo site (41NA27) in adjacent Nacogdoches County. The term ―Hasinai‖ means ―our own
people‖ and the term ―Texas‖ or ―Tejas‖ (meaning ―friend‖) derives from the Hasinai form of
greeting (Bolton 1987).

30

The Hasinai were organized in a loose confederacy composed primarily of the Hainai,
Nabedache, Nacogdoche, Nasoni, Nadaco, Neche, Nacono, Nechaui, and Nacao, but membership
apparently was fluid and fluctuating (Story 1990:322). An intertribal organization pertaining
especially to religious beliefs was the basis of this confederacy. At the top of a relatively weak
social and political hierarchy was the grand xinesi, along with the subordinate chiefs of each tribe
and their lesser officials (Bolton 1987; Story 1982:21). Although males inherited these offices,
females often held powerful positions and descent was likely through the female line.
René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, established Fort Saint Louis on the Gulf coast in 1685
(John 1975:182). By 1686, he had traveled northward to Caddo country. Father Anastasius
Douay, a member of the La Salle expedition, reported on his observations of Caddo culture.
According to Douay, the Hasinai village of Cenis (an Allen phase [ca. A.D. 1650–1800] Caddo
settlement) was extremely large, but settlements within the village were dispersed into small
hamlets of 10 or 12 houses (Swanton 1942:39). The apparent reason for this housing
arrangement was to provide each family with nearby cropland and access to water for household
use and frequent bathing (Hatcher 1928:154). Subsistence was based on cultivated corn, beans,
calabashes, and sunflowers, along with the quickly adopted European watermelon. Seasonal wild
acorns, nuts, grapes, plums, persimmon, berries, roots, and herbs supplemented the cultigens, and
meat protein was obtained from fish, deer, bison, rabbit, bird, bear, snake, and turtle (Griffin
1954:110, 113; Swanton 1942:128, 132–133). Tools to procure these food items consisted of
stone dart and arrow points, woven baskets, pottery cooking vessels, and wooden mortar and
pestles (Story 1982:22). Shell, ceramics, stone, and salt were commonly traded over wellestablished exchange routes that long-preceded European contact. Funerary practices were
predicated on the status of the individual. The most elaborate ceremonies were held for the
xinesi, with the attendance of all members of the confederacy, and the least elaborate were for
simple members of the group. Although the dead were buried with bows, arrows, knives, food,
and domestic items, the status of the individual determined the items (Newcomb 1961:301;
Swanton 1942:203–204).
By the late 1600s, a regular European presence/settlement into Caddo territory had begun. In
1690 the Spanish established missions in the Hasinai area—San Francisco de los Tejas and
Santísimo Nombre de María—but abandoned them in 1693 when the local population refused to
comply with Spanish attempts to convert and control them (Swanton 1942:46–49). In response to
St. Denis‘s 1714 French trading post at Natchitoches, three more Spanish missions were
established in 1716—a second Mission San Francisco de los Tejas just east of the Neches River,
and two in the main villages of the Hasinai (Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción, likely on
the Angelina River) and the Nacogdoches (Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, likely on Bayou La
Naña) (Swanton 1942:46–49). In 1779, a group of Euro-American settlers from the Trinity River
moved into the Nacogdoches area and a rancher set up operations on Bayou Loco near or on the
Deshazo site. These moves, as well as intruding Indian groups, forced the Hasinai to immigrate
westward to the prairie or to withdraw into smaller villages. The French briefly regained control
of Louisiana, only to lose it again in 1803 when President Jefferson bought the Louisiana
Purchase. The way was now open for intense American immigration, which effectively forced
the remaining Hasinai to move to a reservation on the Brazos in 1845, and then finally to Indian
Territory in Oklahoma in 1859 (Newcomb 1961:289; Swanton 1942:71–88).

Northcentral Texas
This synopsis deals with the Dallas and Paris districts that are archeologically distinct from the
northeastern portion of the state, though the Paleo-Indian period discussion presented for
Northeast Texas can be applied to Northcentral Texas as well. There are, however, some
differences; Northcentral Texas is known for several highly significant sites that have helped to
shape our understanding of the earliest occupation of the New World. These sites and others are
discussed in the following section.

Paleo-Indian Period
Point types found in Northcentral Texas that can be associated with the early to late parts of the
period consist of Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, Plainview, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff. Based on a
sample of projectile points from surface sites, Prikryl (1990) has concluded that among the most
common Paleo-Indian point types in this area are Plainview and Dalton. Ferring and Yates
(1997) suggest that these types date to about 10,000–9,500 years ago, based on crossdating with
other regions. The suggested age for these types may correspond with the onset of early
Holocene alluviation in the local river valleys, including the Trinity and Sabine. The majority of
the recorded Paleo-Indian sites cluster in the upper Trinity drainage, where the most intensive
archeological investigations have taken place, though often these sites consist of no more than
one or two projectile points. As with many other areas of Texas, Paleo-Indian materials in
Northcentral Texas often are found in surface contexts or mixed with later materials. The
generally low density of Paleo-Indian artifacts and sites and the tendency for projectile points to
be made from nonlocal lithics have led investigators to characterize these populations as highly
mobile, with low regional densities (Lynott 1981:100–101).
The Paleo-Indian occupation of the upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through
diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or from stratigraphically mixed contexts
(Meltzer 1987; Meltzer and Bever 1995). The Field Ranch site (41CO10), along the upper Elm
Fork of the Trinity River, is a prime example of typical site contexts (Jensen 1968).
Interestingly, the only two investigated sites in Northcentral Texas with apparently discrete
Paleo-Indian components—the Lewisville Lake and Aubrey sites, located in the northern part of
the Dallas District—are early, both producing Clovis projectile points. The Lewisville Lake site
(41DN72) contained 27 hearth features with an associated Clovis point and other sparse lithics
(Crook and Harris 1957, 1958; Story 1990:182–184). Although the original radiocarbon dates on
the hearths suggested an anomalously early age for Clovis points (ca. 37,000 B.P.), later work by
the Smithsonian Institution (Stanford 1981) appears to have resolved the controversy concerning
the date of the occupation there. Apparently, the presence of naturally occurring lignite in these
hearths, either as a fuel or as an inadvertent inclusion, contaminated the radiocarbon samples.
Consequently, the usually accepted date of 12,000–10,000 years ago (10,000–8000 B.C.) for
Clovis period occupations is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human occupation of
Northcentral Texas. The deeply buried Aubrey site (41DN479), located on the Elm Fork north of
Dallas, yielded lithic debitage and Clovis points buried beneath 8 meters (m; 26 feet [ft]) of
Holocene Alluvium on the Elm Fork floodplain (Ferring 1989, 2001). The discovery of this site
suggests that well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in Northcentral Texas will only be found by
examining deeply stratified Holocene Alluvium in modern floodplain situations.

32

The Lewisville Lake and Aubrey sites contained a variety of faunal remains, both large and small.
The largest, white-tailed deer, can be associated comfortably with the Clovis occupation at the
Lewisville Lake site. The preponderance of small game at the Aubrey site could be interpreted as
representing a more generalized pattern of foraging than the reliance on mammoth and bison
apparently demonstrated at Clovis sites on the Southern Plains (Hofman 1989a:31–32). Such a
divergence in subsistence patterns may reflect an inherent adaptability of Clovis technology to
changing environmental conditions encountered as early populations spread southeastward into
Texas (Ferring and Yates 1997).
There are no excavated and reported Paleo-Indian components on the central Blackland Prairie
itself. Nonetheless, a variety of early points has been found, largely in surface contexts, and it is
clear that this part of Texas was used throughout the period from ca. 10,000 to 6,500 B.C.
Presumably, this use was by hunter-gatherer groups with low population densities and high
residential mobility. An analysis of materials collected by C. K. Chandler and other avocational
archeologists from sites chiefly in Ellis County during the Superconducting Super Collider
project identified a handful of Paleo-Indian projectile points typed as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
Golondrina, and San Patrice, along with several untyped lanceolate specimens (Yedlowski et al.
1998). Other early materials from the area include a few San Patrice points from the RichlandChambers Reservoir (McGregor and Bruseth 1987) and a cache of 23 prismatic blades from a site
in Navarro County (Young and Collins 1989).

Archaic Period
For Northcentral Texas, the Archaic is tentatively dated between ca. 6500 B.C. and A.D. 700, with
segments of approximately 2,500 years often considered as early, middle, and late divisions of the
period (Prikryl 1993:199). Thus, the Early Archaic has been dated from ca. 6500 to 4000 B.C.,
the Middle Archaic from 4000 to 1500 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 700.
Relatively recent overviews that cover the Archaic in this portion of Texas include Hofman
(1989a), Prikryl (1990), and Story (1985, 1990). Diagnostic artifacts for the period are similar to
those of adjacent regions, although developing a sound chronological sequence of diagnostic tool
types has proven difficult, because many of the investigations have focused on surface
manifestations. Prikryl (1990) suggests that Early Archaic projectile points include early splitstemmed varieties and possibly Angostura, and Middle Archaic points include basal-notched
forms such as Bell, Andice, and Calf Creek along with Wells, Dawson, Carrollton, and Bulverde.
Late Archaic point types reportedly include Castroville, Marshall, Edgewood, Ellis, Trinity,
Palmillas, Yarbrough, Dallas, Godley, Elam, and Gary (Prikryl 1990). At one time, the
Carrollton and Elam foci were used to define the Middle and Late Archaic, respectively (Crook
and Harris 1952, 1954). Reevaluation of the type-site artifacts, however, showed that the
materials were so mixed that perpetuation of these foci provides little interpretive value (Hofman
et al. 1989; Prikryl 1990). Some of this mixing and the generally low numbers of Early and
Middle Archaic sites may be due to extensive erosion of mid-Holocene deposits, as has been
documented for the Brazos drainage west of the Dallas District in Young, Stephens and
Throckmorton counties (Ensor et al. 1992).
Though few isolable components have been analyzed for the various divisions of the Archaic
period in Northcentral Texas, slowly increasing populations responding to warmer and drier
environmental conditions have been postulated to explain the overall archeological record of the
period (Lynott 1981; Story 1990). It is thought that these factors may have led Archaic
33

populations of the Cross Timbers and prairie areas of Northcentral Texas to develop a diversified
hunting and gathering pattern based on bottomland resources of the rivers and major creeks,
while populations on the Rolling Plains maintained a focus on bison hunting (Hofman 1989a).
Projectile points of the period were fashioned from local lithic materials, suggesting that
populations were less mobile than were their Paleo-Indian predecessors. Less mobility also may
suggest refinement of the diversified subsistence pattern to include scheduling of resource use
within more restricted areas. Evidence from Late Archaic sites at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and
McGregor 1988) and Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997) indicates repeated site
occupation by small groups, which could support the resource-scheduling hypothesis. Still, even
with refinement of resource utilization, evidence of dietary stress has been found on Late Archaic
human skeletal materials (Ferring and Yates 1997; Gill-King 1987).
Mixing of components also has hampered interpretations regarding downstream Trinity River use
by Native Americans during the lengthy Archaic period. Because few pure Archaic components
have been excavated, particularly ones dating to the first two-thirds of the period, it is difficult to
say much about artifact chronologies, subsistence practices, or settlement strategies. A variety of
projectile point styles traditionally associated with the Early and Middle Archaic periods in
Central Texas—for example, Andice, Angostura, Bell, Gower, Hoxie, Martindale, Nolan, Travis,
and Uvalde (Yedlowski et al. 1998)—was identified during analyses for the Superconducting
Super Collider project (although a host of other types perhaps dating to this time and later were
identified as well, their chronologies are less certain), but these points are few in number and do
not appear to represent major occupation of this part of the Blackland Prairie. Demonstrably
early points were even scarcer at the nearby Pecan Springs site at Bardwell Reservoir and the
Strawn Creek site at Navarro Mills Reservoir, with a Hoxie point from Pecan Springs being the
clearest example (Duffield 1963; Sorrow et al. 1966). The relatively intensive work at RichlandChambers Reservoir suggests a similar conclusion for the western edge of the Oak Woodlands,
although it has been noted that data pertaining to the Early to Middle Archaic may be scarce in
part because sites dating to this interval lie deeply buried or were removed by extensive erosion
during the mid-Holocene (Fields 1995; McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Only a few radiocarbon
assays predating 4,000 years ago (2000 B.C.) were obtained, but points dated to this interval in
Central Texas (for example, Bell/Andice/Calf Creek and Hoxie) occur at the Richland-Chambers
Reservoir in only very small numbers.
A much different picture is presented for the late portion of the Archaic period, after about
2000 B.C. All areas of the central Blackland Prairie that have been studied archeologically
contain sites dating to this period, and the Late Archaic represents the earliest time for which
much is known about Native American lifeways. Both the Pecan Springs and Strawn Creek sites
on the Blackland Prairie proper yielded such Late Archaic point types as Gary, Dawson, and
Yarbrough, although they tend to be mixed with materials from later occupations (Duffield 1963;
Sorrow et al. 1966). The surface collections analyzed during the Superconducting Super Collider
project also contained these types, as well as a number of Late Archaic types common in Central
Texas—such as Bulverde, Darl, Ensor, Marcos, Marshall, Montell, and Pedernales—and a variety
of probable Late Archaic forms more characteristic of the northern and eastern parts of the state
such as Carrollton, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, and Kent (Yedlowski et al. 1998). Noting the
relatively high frequency of Late Archaic projectile points, Yedlowski et al. (1998) suggest that
the region saw an increased use by hunter-gatherers as a result of moister climatic conditions than
before, presumably associated with greater productivity in subsistence resources. They also note
that, while the projectile point evidence indicates interaction with groups living in Central Texas
proper, larger proportions of points indicate affinities with eastern Texas than during the Early
and Middle Archaic.
34

Brown (1987:44-22 through 44-26) presents similar conclusions concerning an increase in
occupational intensity and increased interaction for those project areas at the eastern edge of the
region—i.e., Cedar Creek Reservoir (southeastern Kaufman County) and Richland-Chambers
Reservoir (southeastern Navarro County). Two of the three excavated sites at Cedar Creek
Reservoir have strong Late Archaic components represented by numerous Gary points and a
variety of other lithic tools (Story 1965), and at least 15 sites at Richland-Chambers Reservoir
have identifiable components of this age. In addition to constellations of projectile point styles
(e.g., Dawson, Gary, Godley, Kent, and Yarbrough) that indicate ties more to the north and east
than to the south and west, each of these areas has yielded information suggesting that ceramics
may have been introduced into the material culture of local groups during the latest part of the
Late Archaic, as they were across most of Texas to the east (where this interval usually is called
the Early Ceramic period, and sometimes the Woodland period).
At Cedar Creek Reservoir, there are hints in the distributional data from the Lacy and Gossett
Bottoms sites that the initial use of ceramic containers preceded introduction of the bow and
arrow, although it is difficult to be certain because the sites were not well stratified and the sherds
could not be related to known early types such as Williams Plain (Story 1965). At RichlandChambers Reservoir, distinctive shell-tempered sherds were recovered from contexts dated
between A.D. 200 and A.D. 700 at the Adams Ranch site (Bruseth and Martin 1987), apparently
representing the earliest ceramic industry in this part of the Trinity River basin.
The most complete picture of the archeology of the Late Archaic for this region comes from the
Oak Woodlands at the eastern margin of the Blackland Prairie. Along Richland and Chambers
creeks, Late Archaic groups appear to have been hunter-gatherers whose subsistence pursuits
focused on wild plant foods, such as hickory nuts and prairie turnip, and faunal taxa such as deer,
turtle, small mammal, bird, and fish (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Although presumably not
sedentary, these groups clearly used the area in an intensive fashion for residential purposes, and
it appears that populations increased while territory sizes decreased. A conspicuous component
of the record are the so-called ―Wylie pits,‖ which are large man-made depressions measuring
approximately 16 m (52.5 ft) in diameter and 0.61 m (2 ft) in depth, excavated at the Bird Point
Island and Adams Ranch sites. These large features appear to have been used for communal
processing of vegetal resources (and later as cemeteries), perhaps in the context of band
aggregation in ―tension zones‖ as territories decreased in size (McGregor and Bruseth 1987).
Human burials are common in the archeological record of the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
periods of at least the eastern part of Northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1993). Some of these burials are
associated with Wylie pit features. These features were first identified at a series of sites along
the East Fork of the Trinity River and were considered an important trait of the Wylie focus
(Harris and Suhm 1963; Stephenson 1952; Wilson 1946). Radiocarbon assays from pits at the
Upper Rockwall and Sister Grove Creek sites in the area of Lavon Lake suggest that the pits and
the Wylie focus were associated with the Late Prehistoric period (Lynott 1975; Ross 1966).
Lynott (1977) widened the temporal span by incorporating a Late Archaic phase into the focus
definition. Subsequent work on Wylie pits at Richland-Chambers Reservoir to the south
confirmed their Late Archaic age (Bruseth and Martin 1987). Nonetheless, the wide range of
associated artifact types and the long time span represented by the pits made it clear that the
Wylie focus was not a useful construct. Bruseth and Martin (1987), while discarding the focus as
unusable, further supported Lynott‘s (1975) original interpretation of the pits as being associated
with large-scale food processing. Their interpretation equates the pits to the burned rock middens
of Central Texas, with both representing group aggregations.
35

Late Prehistoric Period
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 700–1700) is marked by the initial
appearance of arrow points. The A.D. 700 date for the start of this period is based upon dated
contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage to the west. Group aggregation and
large-scale manipulation of subsistence resources, as represented by the Wylie pits and the human
burials they contain, may be indicative of societal changes that continued through the Late
Prehistoric period. Habitation structures indicating increased sedentism, at least in certain places
and at certain times, have been found in some Late Prehistoric sites, along with cultigens, such as
corn, and arrow points and ceramics indicating important technological changes. Also, there may
be evidence (e.g., the distinction between burials placed inside and outside Wylie pits) of
differential mortuary practices that could reflect a shift toward a hierarchical social structure,
although this evidence is nowhere nearly as strong as that for the Caddo area of Northeast Texas.
Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) have proposed that the Late Prehistoric period be divided
into an early and a late phase, with the early phase reflecting a continuation of the foraging
subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period and the late phase reflecting Southern
Plains influences. Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites of this
period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970).
Prikryl‘s (1990, 1993) Late Prehistoric I period (A.D. 700-1200) is marked by the Scallorn,
Catahoula, Steiner, Alba, and Bonham arrow point types. Ceramic vessels are mostly grogtempered and undecorated, but some evidence indicates influences from other regions in some
locally manufactured wares displaying designs similar to those associated with East Texas
Caddoan ceramic types. Evidence for corn and structures has been found at sites at Joe Pool Lake
in western Dallas County as well as to the north at Hubert Moss Lake near the Red River (Lorrain
1969; Martin 1994; Peter and McGregor 1988). Farther west, cultural changes also were taking
place on the Rolling Plains, though this area held onto its Archaic lifestyle even after
technological innovations such as the bow and arrow were accepted (Lynott 1981).
As a result of intensive excavations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake, Peter and
McGregor (1988) proposed a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site
yielded house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn
cupules. Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late
twelfth or early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an
intrusive Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have
occurred, in at least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also
likely that ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time.
In regard to the Late Prehistoric components investigated at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates
(1997:305) summarize the results of that research as follows:
Late Prehistoric II occupations are characterized by multiple, short-term use of probably logistic sites
which lack ceramics and architecture. The architectural remains at 41DN102 are the only ones in the
project area. At best, this was a small hamlet, occupied ca. 500–650 yr. bp. No evidence of
horticulture was recovered, and the [Late Prehistoric II] fauna indicate a foraging strategy that
emphasized deer procurement and occasionally bison as well. Transport and curation of chert raw
materials was about as frequent as in the [Late Archaic], and long-distance raw material acquisition
(e.g., Edwards, Alibates) is not evidenced. Ceramic traditions are dominated by locally produced
shell-tempered wares, which by this time were being produced in the Southern Plains region generally.
As recorded by previous synthesis (Story 1990), little if any interaction with the Caddoan area is
indicated. Thus, the Ray Roberts prehistoric data suggest that regional traditions emerged at the end of
the [Late Prehistoric] period largely independent of the Plains or East Texas Woodlands.
36

McGregor (personal communication 1999) has argued strongly for a ―middle subperiod‖ of the
Late Prehistoric that he dates between A.D. 1000 and 1350. He believes that arrow points with
straight or rectangular stems are most diagnostic of this period and identifies three sites or site
areas with relatively clean (or minimally mixed) components of this middle subperiod—the
Cobb-Pool site, Area B at the McDonald site (41HI105) on Hackberry Creek on the middle
Brazos River drainage, and Area F at the Haley‘s Point site (34MA15) on the Red River (Brown
et al. 1987; Peter and McGregor 1988; Rohn 1998). McGregor also notes that maize is common
at Haley‘s Point, as it is at Cobb-Pool, and suggests that these sites are representative of a
relatively short-lived, region-wide subsistence pattern involving a partial dependence on
agriculture during this middle subperiod (McGregor, personal communication 1999).
Sites dating to the Late Prehistoric period, after ca. A.D. 700, also are common downstream on the
Trinity area of the Blackland Prairie. The collections studied during the Superconducting Super
Collider project contain substantial numbers of both early (e.g., Alba, Bonham, Catahoula,
Colbert, Scallorn, and Steiner) and late (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz) arrow points, but Yedlowski et
al. (1998) note that early arrow points are more frequent, perhaps reflecting high population
densities continuing from the Late Archaic period. Other than the Perdiz and Scallorn types,
which have such widespread distributions, the arrow point styles indicate eastward and northward
association. The limited ceramic samples, containing sherds reminiscent of types such as Weches
Fingernail Impressed, Killough Pinched, Maydelle Incised, and Poyner Engraved, also support
interaction with Caddoan groups to the east (Yedlowski et al. 1998). The Strawn Creek site at
Navarro Mills Reservoir presents a similar picture, with most of the typed arrow points dating to
the first half of the Late Prehistoric period and the more distinctive ceramics in the small
collection relating to the early Caddoan types of Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Weches
Fingernail Impressed (Duffield 1963). The Pecan Springs site at Bardwell Reservoir also yielded
numerous early arrow points, as well as a respectable number of Perdiz points, along with a small
collection of highly fragmented sherds (Sorrow et al. 1966).
Three sites excavated at Cedar Creek Reservoir contained Late Prehistoric components, although
materials of this age were common only at the Gossett Bottoms and Lacy sites (Story 1965).
Early arrow point forms (e.g., Alba, Catahoula, Friley, Granbury, Scallorn, and Steiner) are better
represented than late ones (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz), but not by much. Not surprisingly, ceramics
are more frequent in this area than to the west and clearly are related to the Caddoan tradition to
the east and northeast; some of the more distinctive decorated sherds were considered reminiscent
of types such as Canton Incised, Killough Pinched, and Ripley or Wilder Engraved (Story 1965).
The faunal remains from the Gossett Bottoms and Lacy sites, many of which probably relate to
Late Prehistoric occupations, consist predominantly of deer, turtle, and small mammal, with bison
occurring only in small numbers. Based on the feature evidence (or lack thereof), it appears that
this part of the Trinity basin was occupied by mobile hunter-gatherers rather than sedentary
groups during the Late Prehistoric period.
Some of the best data concerning Native American use of the region during the Late Prehistoric
period is from Richland-Chambers Reservoir. Sites dating to this interval are common at
Richland-Chambers Reservoir, especially for the early half of the period, and it appears that there
was a significant decline in population densities after about A.D. 1300 (McGregor and Bruseth
1987). The data suggest that most of the excavated sites with Late Prehistoric components were
used for residential purposes (McGregor and Bruseth 1987), although there are some sites, for
example the stream-side concentrations of mussel shells and artifacts at 41FT193 and 41NV139,
that probably were used in a more limited fashion. The house patterns at the Bird Point Island
site point to intensive use by sedentary hunter-gatherers during the first half of the period, and
37

other components that are contemporaneous, slightly earlier, or later (e.g., at Bird Point Island,
Adams Ranch, Irvine, and Little Cedar Creek) have middens and numerous features suggesting
intensive use but no houses. These components may represent occupations that were seasonal in
length. Macrobotanical remains point to use primarily of wild plant foods, i.e., hardwood nuts, a
variety of seeds, and tubers/rhizomes (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). The only tropical cultigen is
maize, and it occurs in very small quantities only in contexts dating to the last half of the period.
Hence, groups who lived in this area were predominantly hunters and gatherers. The arrow
points that characterize the early and late parts of the period—Alba, Scallorn, and Steiner vs.
Perdiz and Cliffton—are the same styles as found elsewhere across the area, and it appears that
Gary dart points may have continued to be used through the early Late Prehistoric (McGregor and
Bruseth 1987:183). Ceramics are moderately common and clearly relate to Caddoan wares, with
most of the identified types (e.g., Maydelle Incised, Poyner Engraved, and Weches Fingernail
Impressed) indicating contact with groups in the Neches River drainage, east of the Trinity.
During the Late Prehistoric II period (ca. A.D. 1300–1700), influences from the Southern Plains
became pronounced in the Cross Timbers and prairie areas. These influences coincided with an
increase in bison herd size in Northcentral Texas (Lynott 1981; Prikryl 1990). Bison was
important to subsistence, but shrinking procurement territory sizes due to population increases
continued the trend toward horticulture and settled village life (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris
and Morris 1970). In terms of technology, a Plains Indian tool assemblage was common (Prikryl
1990). Items associated with this assemblage include calcareous-tempered ceramic vessels, some
of which fit the description for the type Nocona Plain (shell-tempered), and unstemmed triangular
arrow points (such as Maud, Fresno, Harrell, Washita) as well as stemmed Perdiz points. Tools
specific to bison processing include snub-nosed or thumbnail scrapers and edge-beveled Harahey
knives. Bison scapula hoes, which also are common in Plains Indian sites, have been recovered
from sites in the Lewisville Lake and Lavon Lake areas of Denton and Collin counties (Barber
1969; Harris 1945).
The Plains Indian influences associated with settled village life were used to define the Henrietta
complex of Northcentral Texas. This complex, based on Krieger‘s (1946) more expansive
Henrietta focus, extends from the Red River south along the headwaters of the Trinity and Brazos
rivers. The type-site, M. D. Harrell, is located along the Brazos River in Young County just
northwest of Palo Pinto County in the drainage basin for Possum Kingdom Reservoir (Krieger
1946). The Harrell site and other associated sites contain middens, house structures, rock hearths,
storage pits, and burials, and they most often are located on sandy knolls or terraces overlooking
river valleys (Brooks 1989; Forrester 1994). Excavated sites attributed to the Henrietta complex
include the Coyote and Glass sites located on the Red River in Montague County (Lorrain 1967;
Woodall 1967a), and it is clear that sites such as Dillard in Cooke County are related as well
(Martin 1994).
The Henrietta complex as an investigative tool can be limiting since its loose definition tends to
obscure local differences. More recent investigations in the upper Trinity River drainage have
tended to highlight the local differences. At Ray Roberts Reservoir, for instance, Ferring and
Yates (1997) see local trends emerging independent of extraregional influences. They cite the
lack of evidence for extensive maize horticulture and the preponderance of short-term logistical
camps as the basis of their hypothesis. Similarly, Peter and McGregor (1988) demonstrate that
occupation of the Mountain Creek drainage was less intensive in the Late Prehistoric II period
than before and that maize horticulture, if practiced at all, was limited. The adaptation
developing in Northcentral Texas after A.D. 1200 was truly distinctive from the Plains adaptations
revealed to the northwest in Foard County (Peter et al. 1997).
38

Historic Native American—Northcentral Texas
The cultural divergences between Northcentral and Northeast Texas, which began in the Archaic
period, continued into the Protohistoric and Historic periods. Various sociological factors, not the
least of which was the colonization of New Mexico by the Spanish, caused drastic changes in the
cultural makeup of Northcentral Texas, as groups from elsewhere migrated into the area and
existing groups were forced to adapt to their presence. Meanwhile, the Caddoan groups
continued to dominate the Northeastern portion of the state, although significant changes were
occurring there also. Both regions will be treated separately in the following sections.
Prior to Spanish settlement of New Mexico in 1598, European presence in Texas was sporadic at
best. After 1598, however, Spanish influence was never absent from the Southern Plains,
although actual contact with Europeans continued to be limited and only brief records of journeys
into or through the North Texas area exist (Hofman et al. 1989; John 1975).
By the eighteenth century, immigrant Plains Indian groups had moved into and beyond North
Texas, and their documentation by traders and explorers marks the start of the Historic period
(A.D. 1700 to 1850; Prikryl 1993). Unfortunately, since good historical documentation is very
sparse for the upper Trinity River basin during the early Historic era, it is not clear which specific
aboriginal groups were residing in the present-day region at the beginning of this period. What is
clear is that the early Historic period in North Texas was a time of population fluctuation,
movement, and amalgamation (see Newcomb 1993).
Documentary sources suggest that the Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Kitsai, Yojaune,
Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo traversed the region at various times during the period
(Campbell 1983; Newcomb 1961; Newcomb and Campbell 1982). Prior to about A.D. 1725–
1750, Apachean groups appear to have dominated the western portion of the Southern Plains,
known as the High Plains. After that time, the area was increasingly controlled by the Comanche
and Kiowa. On the eastern portion of the Southern Plains, within the area now known as the
Lower Plains and Northcentral Texas, the Wichita tribes became dominant (Bell et al. 1967;
Hofman 1989b:91).
Available data suggest that many of the aboriginal occupants of the eastern margin of the Great
Plains, including North Texas, were Caddoan language speakers, from the Arikara in the north to
the Wichita and Kichai in the south. In this light, it is worth noting that it has also been suggested
that the Socoatino, encountered by the survivors of the Hernando de Soto expedition in the
sixteenth century, were Caddoan speakers and were the same as the Canohatino, identified by the
French in the latter part of the seventeenth century, apparently located at that time ―on the
Blackland Prairies between the Guadalupe and Trinity rivers to the east of present-day San
Antonio, Austin, and Waco‖ (Newcomb 1993:24). However, if the prehistoric occupants of the
eastern margin of the plains in Texas were indeed Caddoan speakers, it would explain how they
were absorbed very early by other Caddoan-speaking groups (such as the Yojuane, Kichai,
Tawakoni, Taovaya, Iscani, and Wichita proper) who arrived in Northcentral Texas in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Most of these groups, in turn, amalgamated to form
the historic Wichita Tribe. Some, however, were probably absorbed by the united Caddo Tribes,
and some may even have joined amalgamations of a variety of groups, such as the Tonkawa,
during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

39

The term Wichita is commonly used to refer to a group of linguistically related tribes, including
the Wichita, Taovaya, Tawakoni, Iscani, Waco, and Kichai. Many of these groups apparently
entered the Southern Plains in the seventeenth century, probably from Kansas and southern
Nebraska, to escape the hostilities of the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:904). The Wichita
were true Plains Villagers, with an economy that was jointly dependent upon agriculture and
bison hunting. They occupied permanent villages of beehive-shaped, grass houses, from which
they conducted semi-nomadic bison hunts. In 1719, their villages were located along the
Arkansas River in northern Oklahoma (Hofman 1989b:95). By 1750, they had moved some of
their villages to southern Oklahoma, along the Red River. Others were located on the upper end
of the Sabine and Neches rivers in Texas and subsequently on the middle Trinity and upper
Brazos rivers. In 1759, the Taovaya village on the Red River was attacked by Diego Ortiz
Parrilla, but was successfully defended. In 1772, the year they concluded a nominal peace with
the Spanish, one of their villages was on the Salt Fork of the Brazos, on the Lower Plains west of
present-day Dallas/Fort Worth (John 1975:Map 3; Webb and Carroll 1952:2:705). Wichita
groups were included in treaties made with the Republic of Texas in 1843 and with the United
States in 1837 and 1856 (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:709). In Texas, they continued to live
between the upper Brazos and Trinity rivers until 1855. In that year, the Tawakoni and Waco
were placed on the Brazos Indian Reservation, south of Fort Belknap, in company with a number
of other Native American remnant groups (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:212; 2:905).
Subsequently, as a result of increasing animosity from white settlers, they were removed to Indian
Territory in 1859 (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:210). The remnants of the Wichita
moved to Kansas during the Civil War, but returned to Oklahoma after the war to settle
permanently near present-day Anadarko (Hofman 1989b:95).
Although archeological sites that can be associated definitely with various historic-age groups are
few, sites attributable to the historic Wichita have been identified at the edges of Northcentral
Texas. Among these is the Stansbury site, now inundated by Lake Whitney, located in Hill
County (Stephenson 1970). Excavations at the site produced burials, house structures, storage
pits, and a variety of aboriginal artifacts along with European ceramics, glass beads, metal arrow
points, and flintlock musket parts. A cluster of Wichita sites also occurs to the north along the
Red River in Montague County. These sites are known collectively as ―Spanish Fort‖ and occur
on both the Oklahoma and Texas sides of the river. Woodall (1967b) excavated one of these
sites, named the Upper Tucker site. The site produced artifacts and features similar to those
discovered at the Stansbury site. Wichita sites on both the Brazos and Red rivers were located
atop high terraces overlooking the rivers. Within the upper Trinity River basin, little evidence of
these historic-age Indian groups has been found, with the exception of a few Native American
sites with European items (Sollberger 1953).
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern
Plains became commonplace. This was the result of increasingly peaceful relations between the
Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians to the north, and the acquisition of the Louisiana
Territory by the United States in 1803.

EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The period of European exploration and settlement and the subsequent Euro-American and
African-American development of North Texas are briefly covered in the remaining portions of
this chapter. For more extensive treatments of this period in North Texas, see Peter and Cliff
(1990a:Chapters 3 and 7) and Peter et al. (1991:Appendix J).
40

The initial European penetration into the general area of North Texas occurred in the middle of
the sixteenth century (around 1542) when the survivors of the Hernando de Soto entrada, led by
Luís de Moscoso de Alvarado, entered Texas in their attempt to reach New Spain by land
(Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Weddle 1985). Moscoso‘s exact route is unknown, but
archeological studies indicate that he apparently traversed the Red River valley somewhere
between present-day Shreveport, Louisiana, and Texarkana, Texas. The party crossed the Red
River and journeyed through Northcentral Texas to present-day Wichita Falls before returning to
the Mississippi River to travel to the Gulf of Mexico. Recent reconstructions of the Moscoso
route through Texas (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991) equate the province of ―Naguatex‖ with the
Hatchel-Mitchell-Moores site complex in northern Bowie County, suggesting that from here the
entrada moved southwest through current Bowie County to cross the Sulphur River somewhere
in the vicinity of present-day Douglassville, where Wright Patman Lake is located.
In the late 1600s, the Spanish introduced the first of their missions into East Texas. The goal of
these missions was to remove the indigenous religions and to Christianize the native populations.
In 1690 the Spanish established missions in the Hasinai area—San Francisco de los Tejas and
Santísimo Nombre de María—but abandoned them in 1693 when the local population refused to
comply with Spanish attempts to convert and control them (Swanton 1942:46–49).
The French, led by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, first intruded into eastern Texas by
establishing Fort Saint Louis in 1685 (John 1975:182), and in 1714 St. Denis set up a trading post
at Natchitoches (in present-day Louisiana). Spanish fear of an increased French presence in
Texas led to the 1716 decision to try again to establish a series of missions and presidios in East
Texas—this time a second Mission San Francisco de los Tejas near the Neches River; Nuestra
Señora de la Purísima Concepción (later moved to the San Antonio area in 1731) on the Angelina
River; Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe at present-day Nacogdoches; San José de los Nazonis in
present-day northwestern Nacogdoches County; and Nuestra Señora de los Ais (reestablished in
August 1722 within the present city limits of San Augustine), as well as San Miguel de Lineares
de los Adaes in present-day Louisiana—as a buffer against further French encroachment into that
region (Cooper et al. 2003; Pool 1975:28; Swanton 1942:46–49). When France and Spain went
to war, the French at Natchitoches attacked the Spanish settlement of Los Adaes, forcing the
Spanish to abandon the area once again (Newcomb 1961:288). After the truce in 1721, Spanish
representative Marques de Aguayo persuaded the French to withdraw from Texas. He
reestablished the missions and set Los Adaes as the capital of the Province of Texas. After
briefly regaining control of the area, the French sold it as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.
In the Red River area, the French established Le Poste des Cadodaquious in present-day Bowie
County in 1719, and explored what is now Franklin County (Harper 2002). Benard de la Harpe‘s
1719 trading post (which became known as the Nassonite Post) on the Red River north of
present-day Texarkana was the first European settlement in the Great Bend (Cooper et al. 2003;
Kelley and Coxe 1996:21). Another effort by Spain to curb French influence occurred in 1760,
when Fray Jose Francisco de Calahorra y Saenz led an expedition to present-day Rains County to
make peace with the Native American tribes in Northcentral Texas. These trading posts
eventually served as illicit trading centers between the two European colonies: modern-day
archeological investigations have yielded artifacts of Spanish and French origin that would
suggest that the different cultures interacted at the trading sites.

Following the sale of Louisiana to the United States in 1803, Anglo-American immigration into
North Texas intensified, although for a number of years it was not clear who actually owned the
area south of the Red River. The United States considered it (and indeed, most of Texas) to be
part of the Louisiana Purchase, and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939).
Spain (and later Mexico), on the other hand, was violently opposed to this view, and at several
times during the first few decades of the nineteenth century the dispute nearly led to war (Smith
1991). The first official Anglo-American penetration of the region was by the 1806 FreemanCustis Expedition, which was turned back at Spanish Bluffs, along the Red River, by a Spanish
military force (Flores 1984).
Despite Spain‘s claim, North Texas was too close to the United States not to fall into the AngloAmerican sphere of influence, and settlement continued. The earliest settlements were confined
to the areas immediately adjacent to the Red River, but after 1818, settlement pushed into the
prairies along river tributaries and early roads such as Trammel‘s Trace and Dayton‘s Road.
Trammel‘s Trace, a popular immigrant route into Texas after 1813, crossed the Sulphur River at
Epperson‘s Ferry and continued southwestward through Cass County to Hughes Springs, founded
in 1839, and then south to cross Cypress Creek 2 miles west of modern-day Jefferson (Webb and
Carroll 1952:2:793–794). Dayton‘s Road was a major east–west overland route that ran along the
divide between the Sulphur and Red rivers.
The original Anglo-American settlers in Texas were largely subsistence farmers residing on small
holdings, with an economy based on grain and livestock production (Peter and Cliff 1990a:36).
The commercial production of cotton apparently was not introduced until the 1830s (Fehrenbach
1968), a shift that was accompanied by increasing numbers of slaves in the region. The town of
Jefferson, on Cypress Creek, was a major cotton market, and the antebellum planters throughout
the region undoubtedly sent their cotton there for sale (Peter and Cliff 1990a:39). Other major
industries established about the same time included tan yards and syrup mills; after 1857, railroad
construction also progressed westward (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198, 2:59).
As settlers began to move into Texas, they remained under first Spanish and then Mexican control
until the struggle for Texas independence in 1836. For the most part, North Texas was beyond
the direct sphere of the conflict involving the fight for Texas independence: that conflict played
out primarily in South and Central Texas in 1835 and 1836. The most significant change
thereafter involved decrees by President Mirabeau Lamar, the second president of Texas, to make
the settlers of the Texas Republic safe from marauding Native Americans by adopting an Indian
removal or extermination program. Active efforts to drive off or exterminate the Native
Americans in North Texas had been under way for some time. In one instance in 1837, a group
of Texas Rangers under the command of Lt. A. B. Van Benthuysen camped on Turtle Creek after
conducting raids on Indians to the north (Maxwell 2002). Subsequently, many native groups who
used the Trinity River basin relocated north of the Red River.
Texas traded its independence for U.S. statehood in 1846, entering the union as the twenty-eighth
state, but did not remain a state for long. Sectarian politics were raised to a fever pitch during
that period, and after the presidential election of 1860, Texas began to consider secession. The
sympathies of most of the Anglo-American residents of North Texas lay with the secessionist
southerners; after all, a majority of them had immigrated from the South, the region as a whole
had a substantial slave population, and the cash economy of the area was built on slave-based
agriculture, even though most of the individual farmers could not afford to own slaves. In most
of Northeast and Northcentral Texas anti-Union feelings ran high (Webb and Carroll
42

1952:1:306), and nearly all the counties in the study area voted to secede—though some, like
Delta County, did support Sam Houston‘s Unionist forces during the early part of the war
(McCroskey 1997). Eventually, Texas became a part of the Confederate States of America.
Although the fighting never reached North Texas, the Civil War still inflicted hardships on the
region (WPA 1992:55–58). Because the majority of able-bodied men were away fighting for the
Confederacy, most small towns and villages were left unprotected from and fearful of Native
American raids (Denton County History Page 2001). The result was an eastward retreat of the
frontier. Simultaneously, the region also experienced considerable immigration of Southerners
who were moving west to escape the warfare that ravaged the Deep South. The region gradually
became impoverished as the war progressed, when food and other commodities became
expensive and difficult to obtain (WPA 1992:55–58).
North Texas escaped serious, direct effects from the Civil War, being too far from the centers of
fighting to the east and south to be affected by Union forces, and too far east of the frontier to be
affected by the resurgence of Native American problems that accompanied the withdrawal of
U.S. and Texas military forces (Pool 1975:110–113). The defeat of the South in 1865 brought
with it the end of slavery in Texas, the breakdown of the old slave-based plantation system, and
the presence of a Union army of occupation. The end of slavery brought many changes to the
economy of rural North Texas. Lacking the cheap and dependable labor resources provided by
slavery, the large plantations of the prewar period ceased to be economically feasible and many
were broken up and partially sold off. Most of the land put on the market found its way into the
hands of speculators and investors, with the result that a new system of sharecropping or tenant
farming replaced the old plantation system. Productive land was now often held by absentee
landlords, with the labor supplied by African-American or poor Anglo-American sharecroppers
or tenants. Although this system failed to improve the lot of the sharecroppers and tenants, it was
a successful replacement for the prewar system, and by the beginning of the twentieth century,
the bulk of the rural farms in Northeast Texas were operated by sharecroppers or tenants.
The state re-entered the Union in 1877. After 1870, the population of North Texas began to
increase, and the region began to recover from the worst effects of the war and the subsequent
recession. One of the most important factors in this recovery was the increasing role of the
railroad in the regional economy. A small amount of railroad construction had occurred prior to
the outbreak of the war, when more than 50 miles of track had been laid westward from
Texarkana in 1857 by the Memphis, El Paso, and Pacific Railroad. Following the end of the war,
construction did not resume for four more years. When it finally did, it continued at a relatively
steady rate. In 1871 and 1872, the Texas and Pacific Railroad went through the southern corner
of Upshur County and the eastern portion of Cass and Marion counties. In 1876, the East Line
and Red River Railroad (later part of the Louisiana and Arkansas), building west from Jefferson,
crossed western Marion County and the southwest portion of Cass County. In the piney woods of
northeastern Texas, the Houston, East and West Texas Railway from Houston to Shreveport was
completed in 1882, quickly followed by the Kansas and Gulf Short Line, the Texas Southeastern,
the Grovetop, Lufkin and Northern, the Texas and New Orleans, and the Angelina and Neches
River railroads. In 1901 the Gulf, Beaumont, and Great Northern Railroad as well as the St. Louis
and Southwestern Railway had completed lines through San Augustine County; and by 1902 the
Eastern Texas Railroad was operating from Lufkin to Kennard in southeastern Houston County,
thus connecting the northeastern counties and opening manufacturing/trade/transportation
opportunities.

43

New towns sprang up along these railroad routes and developed as important shipping centers
(Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306). The continuing expansion of the railroads after 1870, and the
improved communications they brought, spurred the development of other local industries as
well. The economic boom caused by the railroads brought many changes to Dallas and Fort
Worth, the two largest towns in the region, both of which were sited on the Trinity. During this
period, lumbering assumed its place as an important industry in many areas of the piney woods of
northeastern Texas (Chandler 1937). The Houston, East and West Texas Railway and the Gulf,
Beaumont, and Great Northern Railroad allowed transportation of lumber from timber-rich Polk,
Angelina, San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Trinity, and Nacogdoches counties. Sawmills to
process this lumber also sprang up throughout these Northeast Texas counties, especially in
Lufkin and Angelina County, which led to innovations for lumber and paper production, and
provided another major source of employment (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:824). These mills
helped supply raw material to factories located in Texarkana and in other large towns (Webb and
Carroll 1952:1:198).
Following the arrival of the railroads, colleges and universities soon made their way to Northeast
Texas. Central College, a Methodist institution, was established in 1881 (renamed Eastman
College in 1895) in Sulphur Springs, the county seat of Hopkins County (Jennings 2001). East
Texas Normal College, later renamed East Texas State University (and now known as Texas
A&M University–Commerce), was established in 1894 in Commerce, located 15 miles from
Greenville. Stephen F. Austin State University was founded in Nacogdoches in 1923. Numerous
universities, colleges, and branches thereof sprang up throughout the increasingly urban areas of
Dallas, Fort Worth, and Texarkana.
In spite of the steady growth in nonagricultural industries during these years, farming continued
to be important in Northeast Texas, with the small, owner-operated farm still prominent. Despite
the inequities of the sharecropper and tenant systems, the participants were not locked into the
system as had been the case under slavery, and in the last three decades of the nineteenth century
increasing numbers of African-Americans achieved the status of small landowners. They often
settled in dispersed rural communities separate from those of their white neighbors.
Between about 1920 and 1935, the rural population seems to have generally declined, although
the population of the region as a whole continued to grow (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198). Some
factors that may have influenced this demographic shift were the continued growth of urban
industries, the declining agricultural productivity of the land, and the depressed regional and
national economy. The discovery of oil in many North Texas counties in the 1930s led to the
development of new industries and increased employment, although the overall population of the
region continued to fall (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306, 2:144, 783).
The period following the end of World War II has been one of general prosperity and
urbanization for the entire region. Demographic changes within this area have been dominated
by the growth of medium-sized urban areas such as Texarkana and Marshall, and larger urban
areas like the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, which has swallowed many lesser
municipalities between and surrounding the city centers. Commercial patterns in the region have
benefited from the construction of several major interstate highways (IH 20 and IH 30) that have
served to link the area to major manufacturing centers to both the east and the west. The
improved infrastructure, as well as the construction of several lakes in the area, also has brought
increased prosperity in the form of tourism and the recreational dollar. In spite of this growth,
agriculture and livestock continue to play a major role in the regional economy (Fox 1980:1). In
44

the piney woods area, the timber industry remains perhaps the major industry. The forests of the
area, along with lumber and paper production, have also created a significant tourist industry.
The Angelina National Forest is a major tourist attraction in Nacogdoches and San Augustine
counties, and San Augustine and Shelby counties are the site of the 188,000-acre Sabine National
Forest. The Old Stone Fort and Sam Rayburn Reservoir bring additional income to Nacogdoches,
and Toledo Bend, which borders Shelby County, is a major recreational facility. In Sabine
County, the Indian Mounds Wilderness area is administered by the United States Forest Service
and, along with timbering, produces substantial revenues.

CHAPTER 4
SUMMARY OF IMPACT EVALUATIONS AND SURVEYS

The current contract for the five TxDOT districts of Atlanta, Dallas, Lufkin, Paris, and Tyler
involved 15 work authorizations covering 35 CSJs: two impact evaluations and 33 surveys
(which include two post-discovery surveys, two surveys with test unit excavations, and one with
an associated impact evaluation). These work authorizations, several composed of multiple CSJ
numbers, were for three bridge rehabilitations, 23 bridge replacements, one pavement
reconstruction, one road realignment with bridge replacement, four road-widenings, one new
temporary haul road construction project, and two post-review discovery survey investigations.
The final work authorization also included the production of this report. During the course of
executing these work authorizations, 14 archeological sites were discovered or revisited within
the project areas. Although the contract covered five TxDOT districts, the current work
authorizations were located in only three of the districts—Atlanta, Dallas, and Paris.

METHODOLOGY
Upon receipt of a work authorization under this contract, background research was conducted
prior to initiation of fieldwork. First, the appropriate 7.5 minute U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic quadrangle was consulted for the given project area. An evaluation of the
construction plans, when available, was made to determine areas of possible impact by the
planned work. A file search for known sites within a radius of 1 km (0.6 mi) of the project area
was conducted at TARL and online at the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) website
maintained by the THC. An examination of the appropriate Bureau of Economic Geology map
and U.S. Department of Agriculture soil survey was then undertaken to place the project area in
the proper geological and pedological contexts. The Texas Historic Overlay: A Geographic
Information System of Historic Map Images for Planning Transportation Projects in Texas
(Foster et al. 2006) was also consulted prior to fieldwork (for projects initiated after the map
overlay‘s distribution) to determine the presence of any historic resources mapped in the project
area. Once the work authorization specifics were known and the proper background research was
completed, the researcher was prepared to formulate an appropriate field methodology.

47

The specifications of the work authorization are critical in the determination of a suitable research
strategy. For this particular contract, the work authorizations were issued under two macrocategories: archeological impact evaluations and archeological surveys. The two categories can
be broken down further by the type of proposed transportation-related project under which they
fall, such as, among others, new construction, road widening and/or realignment, bridge and/or
relief structure replacement/rehabilitation, or a combination of these categories.
The two impact evaluation CSJs undertaken for work authorizations under this contract
concerned bridge replacements. The environmental settings of these projects were in rural
pastureland and forested areas. Upon arrival in each project area, an orientation walkover of the
entire project area of potential effects (APE) was undertaken to physically acquaint the
investigators with the local setting. Then the area was inspected for prior disturbances such as
utilities installations, cut-and-fill sections, and highly eroded areas. In addition to knowledge of
the project area geology, pedology, and construction plans, the visual inspection allowed the
investigators to evaluate the sections of the project area that should be inspected by pedestrian
survey. Settings that the investigators determined to have potential to contain archeological
deposits were more carefully visually inspected. Such potential settings consisted of areas in
floodplains of nonintermittent streams, landforms overlooking watersheds, upland areas with
noneroded soils, and areas with potential for historic-age structures or sites. In addition, areas in
proximity to recorded archeological sites plotted outside but adjacent to the project area were also
visually inspected for surface expression of cultural resources. All observations for the bridge
replacement impact evaluations were noted in daily journal entries. Notations of disturbances and
machinery access locations and any sites discovered or revisited were recorded on the appropriate
field maps. Photographic records were made of the general project area and of any sites or
localities discovered or revisited.
The 33 CSJs involving archeological surveys were conducted for projects that involved bridge
replacements/rehabilitations, road/pavement widenings/realignments, new temporary haul road
construction, post-review discovery investigations, or a combination of these. Again, the
environmental settings were rural, with nearby residential development noted in some areas. In
addition to the research material consulted for both impact evaluations and archeological surveys,
field investigators usually had access to the appropriate impact evaluation report for the project
area. The impact evaluation reports made recommendations for portions of the project area that
required additional investigations beyond those completed during the impact evaluation. The
recommendations usually designated areas where additional shovel testing or backhoe trenching
should be conducted to identify the presence or absence of archeological sites. Most surveys for
these work authorization dealt with road/creek quadrant surveys, although limited linear surveys
were also conducted. Shovel tests were placed judgmentally in high probability areas in
undisturbed contexts within quadrant zones and along the length of linear projects, while
conforming to the Council of Texas Archeologists and the THC guidelines for number of shovel
tests per linear mile or acre. Shovel tests generally were 30 cm (12 in) in diameter and typically
excavated in 20-cm (8-in) levels to a depth of 80 cm below surface (cmbs; 32 in below surface
[inbs]). In some cases, pre-Holocene clays prevented the excavation from reaching an 80-cm
depth. Shovel tests were terminated once the Bt-horizon was encountered. Soil recovered from
shovel test units was screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) metal hardware cloth in wood or
plastic frames to determine if artifacts were present. All shovel test units were recorded on a
standardized form and plotted on the appropriate field map.

48

A majority of the work authorizations for archeological surveys was undertaken for projects that
involved replacement or rehabilitation of bridge structures and/or relief structures and with road
widening or realignment. Survey of the bridge areas generally was carried out in less than 5 acres
around the existing structures. Bridge/relief structure surveys required shovel testing, also using
the same methods described above. The shovel test excavations were carried out on new or
existing ROW areas of bridge/relief structure approaches. Since these project areas were usually
in floodplain locations with recent Holocene alluvial deposits, mechanical excavation of backhoe
trench (BHT) units was conducted at many of these project areas. Based on previous impact
evaluations associated with surveys, mechanically excavated BHT test units were recommended
for specific floodplains and other areas that had the possibility of containing deep, undisturbed
cultural deposits. Trenches were excavated under 10 work authorizations (14 CSJs). The depths
of the BHT units ordinarily ranged from 1–2 m (3.3–6.6 ft) with widths that varied from 1–1.5 m
(3.3–4.9 ft), depending on the size of the bucket of the particular machine employed. During the
process of excavating the BHT units, a sample of the backdirt was screened through 0.635-cm
(0.25-in) metal hardware cloth in a wood or plastic frame, and observations of the excavations
were made to determine if archeological deposits were encountered. The range in length of the
BHT units varied between approximately 3 m and 17 m (10 ft and 56 ft), depending on the
particular setting of the excavation; the majority of the trenches were greater than 5 m (16 ft)
long. After completion of the BHT unit excavation, the unit profile was inspected for cultural
deposits and the soil matrix was described and recorded photographically. The placement of
BHT units was made judgmentally by the investigators to provide the most extensive coverage of
the recommended survey area.
All excavation units were backfilled after documentation. All materials generated by these
investigations (artifacts, documents, photographs, etc.) will be permanently housed at TARL at
the conclusion of this contract.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

National Register of Historic Places
The assessment of significance of cultural resources properties is based on federal guidelines.
The criteria to evaluate properties for inclusion in the NRHP are codified under the authority of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. Based on regulations set forth by the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), any resource that is included in or eligible for
inclusion in the National Register is a ―historic property‖ (36 CFR 800.16[1][1]) According to
federal regulations, ―The term ‗eligible for inclusion in the National Register‘ includes both
properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties
that meet National Register listing criteria‖ (36 CFR 800.16[l][2]). The ACHP has set forth the
following regulations to define significance and to determine eligibility of cultural resources:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
49

(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [39 CFR
Part 60].

Texas State Archeological Landmark
Under the Texas Antiquities Code at the state level, archeological sites may be considered
significant and be recognized or designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following
conditions is met:
(1) The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
(2) The archeological site is situated on private lands that have been specifically designated as an
SAL . . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the site‘s original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter
41.7, Antiquities Code of Texas].

SITE DEFINITION
During this contract, a site was defined on the basis of content and extent. When a shovel test
yielded cultural material, additional shovel tests were excavated in a cruciform (when possible) or
linear pattern within the APE, generally at approximately 10-m (33-ft) intervals, from the initial
test until two sterile shovel tests were encountered in each direction. For surficial materials, a site
was defined as five or more cultural items of at least two different artifact materials or classes
within a 20-m (66-ft) square. The site limit was then delimited within the extent of positive
shovel tests and/or surface artifact scatter. Cultural remains meeting these criteria were
designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted to TARL.
Conversely, the discovery of one or two cultural items (either surface or subsurface) not meeting
these criteria was considered an isolated occurrence of human activity and was simply
documented by location and content as a ―locality‖; likewise, historic-era material representing an
obvious single-event trash dump was not considered a site, with only location and content
documented.

SYNOPSIS OF WORK AUTHORIZATIONS
The 15 work authorizations completed under this contract involved survey and impact evaluations
in the Atlanta, Dallas, and Paris districts and consisted of 35 field investigations (33 surveys [two
of which involved additional testing and trenching] and two impact evaluations) (Figure 5; Table
2). Field investigations, by district, were undertaken within the following counties:
Atlanta District, 22 CSJs: Bowie (n=9), Harrison (n=5), Panola (n=1), Titus (n=3), and
Upshur (n=4, one of which was on the Upshur/Marion county line)
Dallas District, 3 CSJs: Dallas (n=1) and Denton (n=2)
Paris District, 10 CSJs: Delta (n=3 [1 of which was an impact evaluation]), Fannin (n=3),
Grayson (n=1 impact evaluation), Hopkins (n=2), and Red River (n=1)
The work authorizations comprised the following projects:
Atlanta District (22 field investigations): archeological surveys for three bridge
rehabilitations, 14 bridge replacements (two with additional testing or trenching), one
pavement reconstruction with an associated impact evaluation, one road realignment with
bridge replacement, and three road widenings (one with scraping along the outside of a
cemetery fence).
Dallas District (3 field investigations):
surveys for two post-review discovery
investigations (one with no CSJ number, only the work authorization issued), and one for
construction of temporary haul roads and drill pads associated with bridge construction.
Paris District (10 field investigations):
eight archeological surveys for bridge
replacements (one with road widening) and for one road widening only; and two impact
evaluations for bridge replacements
The final work authorization under this contract included the development and preparation of this
report.

IMPACTS AND SITE POTENTIAL
One of the principal concerns of both impact assessments and surveys is the identification of
archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16.[1]) and SALs (13 TAC 26.12). Disturbances,
whether natural or man-made (Table 3), diminish the possibility of finding such properties. In the
impact evaluation phase, assessing disturbances can assist in identifying areas where further
survey is not necessary. Conversely, identifying areas possessing a high potential for containing
archeological historic properties or SALs is facilitated by an awareness of the effects of
disturbance. Whether classified as man-made fill, man-made cut, or naturally occurring, certain
disturbances occur in existing ROWs with such frequency that it is possible to form a few
generalized observations regarding their extent and effect on the landscape.
Cut-and-fill episodes occur when a road or bridge approach is elevated above the floodplain. Fill
for the road berm is often obtained from the margins within the ROW and deposited in the center
of the ROW. The result is a raised road berm bordered by depressed areas, which function to
facilitate drainage runoff. If the slope at the junction of the terrace above the floodplain with the
road or bridge is steep or sudden, a road cut is sometimes used to lessen the incline without
raising the road higher. For roads situated parallel with the slope, a road cut on the high side of

the slope is sometimes necessary for a level road. Fill from the road cut may be deposited on the
low side, or used elsewhere. At the immediate junction of the road or bridge with the terrace, a
variety of methods can be employed to hold the shoulders in place against erosion. These can
include concrete or stone aprons or less formally designed sheet metal or wooden aprons.
Road berms are generally 1–3 m (3–10 ft) in height on narrow rural roads, but can be up to 5–6 m
(16–20 ft) in height on major highways or over wide floodplains. The extent of the raised berm
shoulders can be quite wide, ranging from 10 m (33 ft), which are the limits of the ROW on
narrow, one-lane, rural roads, to 20–23 m (66–75 ft) on larger roads. Borrow areas or drainage
ditches are approximately 0.5–1.0 m (2–3 ft) deep on smaller roads, but can extend up to 1.5 m (5
ft). Both trenching and shovel testing reveal that disturbances from earth-working equipment can
extend 0.5 m (2 ft) and deeper.
Underground utilities are typically placed outside the limits of road berms, near the margins of
the ROW, and can be stacked vertically or spaced horizontally. Telephone, fiber optic, and
electrical lines can be laid shallowly in narrow trenches of approximately 1 m (3 ft) in width.
Fiber optic cables are laid farthest from the road, usually at the outer edge of the ROW and
outside of older phone and electric cables. In addition, gas and water lines exposed at stream
crossings have been observed at depths of more than 4 m (13 ft). Sewer and fire hydrant, as well
as gas and water line, placement is a consideration in residential and industrial areas, though these
are not typically marked. Aboveground utility transmission lines are typically placed toward the
margins of the ROW. Within any given ROW, it is possible that 1–3 m (3–10 ft) of horizontal
utility installation disturbances exist.
Because of their association with floodplains, many of these project areas would naturally
undergo depositional processes due to periodic alluviation. Man-made disturbances, however,
exacerbate the natural effects of erosion by altering drainage patterns. Bridge aprons, road berms,
and drainage ditches channel rain runoff through the ROW, causing intense erosion of surface
soils, cutbanks, and terrace edges adjacent to these features. The barbed-wire fence, a common
feature in rural areas, traps debris in its mesh and thus hinders surface water from draining into
contiguous areas. Another trap along creeks is the wire or slat-and-wire ―fence‖ strung across a
61

creek to trap large debris at bridges and culverts. The backup of large debris tends to cause
extensive erosion at the edges of bridges or culverts compromising the structure as well as the
road crossing it. Utility trenches are typically backfilled with the original matrix, and these
loosened soils erode quickly in areas of heightened runoff.
Other disturbances that have been observed in existing ROWs as well as the adjacent areas and
therefore have the potential to be located in new ROWs are usually associated with residential,
commercial, or rural development. In residential areas, improvements can include landscaping,
improved drainages, culvert driveways, curb cuts, and construction. Commercial improvements
that have been encountered in project areas have been railroad beds, dams and their associated
reservoirs, berms, clear cutting, and trash dumping. In rural areas, evidence of plowing, logging,
ranching, and stock pond construction is apparent. Also note that the first stage of
highway/bridge construction consists of vegetation removal by bulldozer in order to remove both
trees and roots.

SITE INVESTIGATIONS

SITE 41BW166 (WA 578 20 SA001 / CSJ 0085-04-034)

Previous Investigations
Site 41BW166 was previously recorded in 1979 as a prehistoric lithic scatter plotted
approximately 120 m east of the proposed US 259 project APE on the Pleistocene terrace
escarpment above Mill Creek (to the north) and Tanyard Creek (to the southwest). The accuracy
of the plotted location was uncertain because of inconsistencies in the site description on the site
form (McCormick 1979a), but the plotted location seemed plausible considering the overall
information provided on the site form. This site was described as a scatter of lithic debris and
fire-cracked rock (FCR) bisected by a dirt road (possibly CR 3316). No diagnostic artifacts were
noted, but an Archaic temporal affiliation was suggested on the site form, possibly due to the lack
of ceramics at the site. Geographic information system (GIS) data provided by TARL indicated
that 41BW166 extends into the APE. No other information about the site was available, and its
eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL was unknown.

Current Investigations
Site 41BW166 was one of the sites investigated in conjunction with the proposed project to widen
an 11.9-mi segment of US 259 from just south of the Oklahoma/Texas state line to just north of
US 82 in De Kalb, Bowie County, Texas. The site is plotted on the De Kalb NW (33094-F6)
USGS 7.5' quadrangle. The APE is defined as the existing 61-m-wide maximum ROW owned by
the state of Texas. Fieldwork for the 2010 cultural resources survey was undertaken in April and
June 2010.
Site 41BW166 is situated on the Pleistocene terrace escarpment above and south of Mill Creek
(near Mill Creek‘s confluence with Tanyard Creek to the west) in an area dissected by numerous
unnamed tributaries of Mill and Tanyard creeks. This area is characterized by broad, gentle rises.
The site area adjacent to the APE is predominantly open pasture or agricultural fields; a small
wooded area to the north extends into the northern half of the site. Vegetation within the APE
consists primarily of tall grasses. The underlying geology of the site, situated on the northern
edge the Pleistocene terrace escarpment, is mapped as Pleistocene Fluviatile Terrace deposits
(BEG 1975). Soils in the vicinity of the site are mapped as Darden loamy fine sand, 1 to 8
percent slopes (Soil Survey Staff 2010). A representative shovel test revealed 20 cm of very pale
brown (10YR 7/4) fine sandy loam over 80 cm of reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) fine sandy loam.
Within the APE, contextual integrity has been compromised by road construction and
maintenance activities and possibly by agricultural use of the adjacent areas.
Previously recorded site 41BW166 was identified during the current survey when positive shovel
tests were encountered along the northern Pleistocene terrace escarpment landform within the
APE (Figure 6). Forty-one shovel tests were excavated on two linear transects, one along each
side of the highway, to determine the site boundary. Recovered cultural materials extend the
previously recorded site boundary at least 60 m to the west, across the present project APE. CR
3316 intersects the ROW about midway along the eastern side of the site, with a wooded area to
the north within the ROW.

65

The recovery of a total of 60 artifacts in 21 positive shovel tests in the eastern and western ROWs
extends the previously recorded site boundary to the west by at least 60 m, across the APE,
covering an area within the APE of approximately 215 m NW–SE by 60 m NE–SW. The
artifacts collected from site 41BW166 consist of 49 prehistoric lithics, a sample of four charcoal
(nutshell) specimens, and seven historic artifacts. The prehistoric lithics assemblage is composed
primarily of 43 pieces of debitage (biface thinning flakes [n=24], decortication flakes [n=11], and
shatter [n=8]) collected from 0–110 cmbs). Quartzite (n=19) and undifferentiated chert (n=17)
comprise the majority of the debitage raw material, with lesser amounts of novaculite (n=4) and
chalcedony, translucent chert, and quartz (n=1 each). The only tested cobble from the project was
recovered from Transect 1/Shovel Test 75, 60–80 cmbs; the specimen is of quartzite. Four pieces
of FCR were found at 0–20 and 60–80 cmbs). A contracting-stemmed quartzite biface as
collected from Transect 1/Shovel Test 50 (40–60 cmbs), possibly representing a dart point, but
more likely a knife based on the asymmetrical resharpening of the blade, indicating a site
occupation during the Late Archaic period. Also from this same shovel test, the sample of four
pieces of burned nutshell (80–100 cmbs) was collected. The historic artifacts, recovered from
three shovel tests (20–60 cmbs), consist of three pieces of clear bottle glass (post-1880), one
fragment of ash tint vessel glass, and a 4-hole button of compressed paper. The button as cheaply
produced, probably for pants, likely in the mid to late nineteenth century (Winchester Sutler, Inc.,
2010). No intact cultural features were encountered during shovel testing.

Recommendations
Site 41BW166 is situated on a terrace above Mill Creek in an area of broad, gentle rises. As
originally recorded, the site lies primarily to the east of the current APE. However, positive
shovel tests with possible Archaic material, based on the recovered stemmed dart projectile
point/knife, have extended the site boundary westward across the current APE. Although no
intact cultural features were found during shovel testing, the preservation and recovery of burned
nutshell fragments and FCR indicate that such features may be present at this site. Based on the
findings that the site may retain intact cultural features and cultural materials recovered from
survey, the portion of site 41BW166 within the APE may retain research potential relevant to
Archaic settlement and subsistence patterns in the uplands of the Red River basin. Therefore,
additional intensive archeological investigations are recommended in the portion of 41BW166
within the APE to determine the presence, extent, and integrity of intact cultural deposits.

SITE 41BW761 (WA 578 11 SA001 AND WA 578 17 SA001 / CSJ 0919-19-052)

Current Investigations
Site 41BW761 is in the northwest quadrant of Anderson Creek and CR 4320 in Bowie County,
plotted on the 1975 Hodgson 7.5' series USGS quadrangle. The existing ROW is owned by the
state of Texas, but proposed construction easements will extend into privately owned property, to
which right-of-entry access was granted. The APE for the proposed TxDOT project has a
maximum width of approximately 61 m. The site was first identified during fieldwork on August
25, 2009, and additional fieldwork was conducted on October 7 and November 4–5, 2009.

67

The site is situated in the undeveloped, periodically inundated floodplain of Anderson Creek on a
small remnant terrace overlooking the creek to the west and its unnamed tributary to the north of
the knoll. The vegetation in the site vicinity consists of some grasses and forbs, but the majority
is secondary hardwood forest composed primarily of oak, elm, and hickory trees, with a limited
understory vegetation of shrubs and vines. The geology in the area consists of Holocene
Alluvium, flanked to the north and south by undifferentiated deposits of the Upper Cretaceous
Navarro Group (BEG 1979). Soil survey maps indicate that the site area is mapped on Thenas
fine sandy loam, frequently flooded. Onsite Shovel Test 4 revealed 20 cm of sandy loam, over
20 cm of very fine sandy loam, over 10 cm of clay.
During the initial field investigations, a positive shovel test in the northwest quadrant (in the
privately owned proposed construction easement) prompted additional subsurface investigation of
the quadrant to determine if an archeological site was present and, if so, to delineate its boundary
(Figure 7). The initial positive shovel test (Shovel Test 4) yielded one chert flake between 10 and
40 cmbs, instigating a subsequent cruciform pattern of radial shovel tests. The two initial shovel
tests (Shovel Tests 5 and 6) to the northwest of Shovel Test 4 each contained cultural materials.
Negative shovel tests to the northwest and the southeast and CR 4320 to the south, an eroding
channel east of the terrace, and the creek to the west delineated the site boundary, with a site size
of approximately 15-x-10 m within the APE. The three positive shovel tests on the eroding
terrace yielded a piece of charcoal and a chert flake from Shovel Test 4 at 40 cmbs, a chert flake
from 10–40 cmbs in Shovel Test 5, and six chert flakes (four from 20–40 cmbs, and one each at
40–60 cmbs and at 60–80 cmbs) from Shovel Test 6. Because all archeological materials
discovered on this particular project were on privately owned property, all archeological materials
were photographed and reburied in their original shovel tests. To aid relocation of the artifacts,
the materials were placed in plastic zip-lock bags or film canisters prior to reburial. The locations
of the shovel tests were then recorded with a GPS device, and a pace-and-compass map of the site
was drawn.
The overall integrity of the deposits in the APE was considered to be low because the area was
within a dynamic floodplain environment with unstable surfaces. The only area that appeared to
maintain a minimal degree of integrity was the eroding terrace (approximately 15–20 m in
diameter) within the northwest quadrant where site 41BW761 was encountered. Because of the
erosion, the low density of artifacts, the lack of diagnostic materials, and the general floodplain
context, the site was considered not eligible for NRHP inclusion.
Nonetheless, TxDOT subsequently considered additional work was needed at the site to
determine if the low artifact densities and lack of diagnostic artifacts resulting from the original
survey stemmed from the site‘s limited research potential or from the small sample size
recovered. In early November 2009, Geo-Marine archaeologists revisited the site. Five
additional shovel tests were excavated around Shovel Tests 5 and 6, and two 1-x-1-m test units
were excavated: one test unit adjacent to Shovel Test 6 at the top of the terrace, and the other on
the mid-slope of the terrace adjacent to Shovel Test 5.
Two of the additional shovel tests (Shovel Tests 12 and 15) and both test units yielded additional
cultural materials. Shovel Test 12 yielded two chert flakes (one cortical, one interior) from 0–20
cmbs, and Shovel Test 15 yielded a red quartzite cobble that was either a tested quartzite core or a
naturally fractured stream cobble. The two 1-x-1-m test units yielded a total of 124 lithic
artifacts, 20 charcoal fragments, and three FCR. Test Unit 1 located on top of the terrace yielded

68

91 lithic artifacts, 13 charcoal fragments, and three FCR; Test Unit 2 located near the mid-slope
of the terrace yielded 33 lithic artifacts and seven charcoal fragments. The lithic materials
included numerous raw material types, most likely collected from local stream gravels, including
fine and coarse-grained white and pink quartzites, a wide range of black, tan/brown, and gray
cherts, and two translucent chert flakes resembling novaculite or chalcedony. Sixty-eight percent
of the total flakes recovered from both test units combined were classified as interior flakes (73
percent from Test Unit 1 and 63 percent from Test Unit 2) suggesting that the site inhabitants
participated in later stages of tool manufacture and/or rejuvenation of existing tools. No features
or temporally diagnostic cultural materials were recovered; however, an incomplete,
nondiagnostic biface was discovered in Test Unit 1 imbricated among stream gravels at 80 cmbs.
It is possible that this biface was used as a knife because one of the edges was left 4–5
millimeters (mm) below the midline, a trait common to prehistoric cutting implements. Three
scrapers and one retouched flake were recovered from Test Unit 1, suggesting that floral and/or
faunal resources were also procured at the site. Finally, a chert preform was recovered from 30–
40 cmbs in Test Unit 2.
As indicated by the stream gravels recovered in almost every level within both test units
excavated at 41BW761, it is likely that the terrace has formed in association with overbank
flooding of Anderson Creek. This process appears to have occurred often enough through time to
prevent stable surfaces from being established, since no distinct bedding or repeatable structures
were observed within shovel tests or test units. Further compromising the integrity of the cultural
deposits at the site is evidence for significant erosion of the terrace. It appears that the ground
surface near Test Unit 2, excavated 30–40 cm downslope from Test Unit 1, has been removed
through natural erosional processes and that the ground surfaces of Test Unit 1 and Test Unit 2 at
some point in time existed at similar elevations. For example, the majority of the artifacts
recovered from Test Unit 1 (around 65 percent) were found between 40 and 80 cmbs, and the
majority of the artifacts recovered from Test Unit 2 (around 90 percent) were found between 10
and 50 cmbs. Additionally, this 40-cm-thickness range in Test Unit 1 and Test Unit 2 (40–80
cmbs and 10–50 cmbs, respectively), consisted of similar natural soil layers composed of 10YR
5/4 sands and 10YR 6/3 and 10YR 6/4 sandy loams. However, no distinct bedding was observed
within this 40-cm-thickness range and not all of the artifacts recovered were confined within this
range. As a result, it is likely that artifacts have been mixed and translocated throughout the soil
matrix in association with natural processes of erosion and deposition. Further clarifying this
interpretation was the recovery of the nondiagnostic biface imbricated among stream gravels at
80 cmbs in Test Unit 1.
Additional disturbances were evidenced by a highly eroded ditch feeding into the southwest
quadrant and inferred by evidence that CR 4320 was bermed to approximately 1 m above the
natural ground surface during construction. The northwest quadrant has also been affected by
disturbance from construction of a road ditch lined with cobbles (likely to prevent erosion), as
well as buried and overhead utilities within the APE.

Recommendations
An intensive archaeological survey identified site 41BW761 on an eroded, remnant terrace
overlooking Anderson Creek and an unnamed tributary along CR 4320. The lack of distinctive
bedding and absence of buried soils and distribution of artifacts within a thick depth range of
mixed alluvial deposits limit the site‘s research potential for contributing to the cumulative
70

culture history in northeast Texas. Additionally, the integrity of the site has been compromised
through significant erosion that has progressed on the boundary of the terrace and removed a
substantial portion of the upper matrix from the majority of the terrace. Further limiting the site‘s
research potential is evidence that artifacts are being translocated and imbricated within stream
gravel deposits. Based on these findings, site 41BW761 does not retain the contextual integrity
or research potential to warrant consideration for further investigation or for in-place protection
or for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.

SITE 41BW766 (WA 578 20 SA001 / CSJ 0085-04-034)

Current Investigations
Site 41BW766 is one of the several sites identified and recorded during cultural resources survey
in conjunction with the proposed project to widen an 11.9-mi segment of US 259 from just south
of the Oklahoma/Texas state line to just north of US 82 in De Kalb, Bowie County, Texas. The
site is on the USGS De Kalb NW (33094-F6) 7.5' series quadrangle. The APE is defined as the
existing 61-m-wide maximum ROW, which is owned by the state of Texas. Fieldwork for the
cultural resources survey was undertaken in April and June 2010.
Site 41BW766 consists of a low-density lithic scatter situated on a small erosional remnant of the
Pleistocene terrace north of Mill Creek in the Red River valley. Pasture comprises the area
surrounding the APE; within the APE, the groundcover is primarily tall grasses and wildflowers.
The underlying geology of the site area is Undifferentiated Holocene Alluvium (BEG 1975).
Soils in the area are mapped as Ruston fine sandy loam, 3 to 8 percent slopes (Soil Survey Staff
2010). Transect 2/Shovel Test 30 revealed 20 cm of yellowish red (5YR 5/8) fine sandy loam
over 80 cm of red (2.5YR 5/8) fine sandy loam. Modern intrusive features at the site include a
fence and gate, an access road, buried utilities, and US 259.
Site 41BW766 was discovered when cultural material was encountered in two shovel tests on a
low rise along the western ROW (Figure 8). The positive shovel tests are approximately 40 m
apart, separated by a small road, on the western side of the ROW. Six additional shovel tests
were excavated in the area of the positive tests to define the site boundary.
Two shovel tests along the western ROW on the Pleistocene rise encountered six artifacts:
prehistoric lithic debris of siltstone (n=1) and quartzite (n=2) debitage (0–20 cmbs), FCR or
thermally altered rock (n=2; 40–60 cmbs); and one historic clear glass body sherd (0–20 cmbs).
Six delineation shovel tests in both the eastern and western ROWs were excavated in the effort to
define the site boundary, but no additional cultural materials were recovered. Cultural deposits
on the highest portion of the rise (approximately 335 ft above mean sea level [amsl]) are confined
to an area of 55 m NW–SE by 20 m NE–SW. No cultural features were encountered within the
APE.

71

Recommendations
Site 41BW766 is a very small scatter of lithic debris and two possible FCR (as well as one glass
fragment) on a small erosional remnant of the Pleistocene terrace north of Mill Creek. No
diagnostic material was recovered and no features were identified within the APE. The site likely
extends beyond the APE to the northeast and southwest into the adjacent pastures. However,
based on the current findings, the portion of the site within the APE has little research potential
due to the low density of artifacts recovered and the degree of modern disturbance in the area.
Therefore, no further investigation of the portion of the site within the APE is recommended.

SITE 41BW767 (WA 578 20 SA001 / CSJ 0085-04-034)

Current Investigations
Site 41BW767 is another of the several sites identified and recorded during cultural resources
survey in conjunction with the proposed project to widen an 11.9-mi segment of US 259 from just
south of the Oklahoma/Texas state line to just north of US 82 in De Kalb, Bowie County, Texas.
The site is plotted on the USGS De Kalb NW (33094-F6) 7.5' series quadrangle. The APE is
defined as the existing 61-m-wide maximum ROW, which is owned by the state of Texas.
Fieldwork for the cultural resources survey was undertaken in April and June 2010.
Site 41BW767 represents of a late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century domestic site with a
minimal prehistoric lithic scatter situated on a topographic rise on the otherwise flat-lying
Pleistocene terrace. The eastern portion of the site is adjacent to a mixed hardwood forest, and
the western portion of the site is adjacent to a pasture. The underlying geology of the site area
consists of Pleistocene Fluviatile Terrace deposits (BEG 1975). Soils in the area are mapped as
Smithdale fine sandy loam, 8 to 12 percent slopes (Soil Survey Staff 2010). A typical shovel test
consisted of brown (10YR 5/3) sandy loam in the upper 20 cm followed by pale brown (10YR
6/3) sand to a depth of approximately 40 cm over grayish brown (10YR 5/2) clay with reddish
brown (5YR 4/4) mottles. This site has been affected by the construction and maintenance of US
259, agricultural practices along the western margin of the APE, buried utilities along the eastern
margin of the APE, and residential development to the north.
Site 41BW767 was identified when cultural materials were recovered in a shovel test (Figure 9).
Additional shovel tests were excavated in the area of the positive tests to define the site
boundary; 13 tests yielded cultural materials. The positive shovel tests within the eastern and
western ROWs of the APE, southeast of CR 3314, encompass an area of approximately 162 m
NW-SE by 56 m NE-SW.
A total of 84 artifacts was collected: 82 historic artifacts and two prehistoric artifacts.
Architectural items (n=19) recovered include bricks (handmade [n=2] and machine-made [n=3]),
window glass (clear [n=1, post-1880; light green [n=6], and light tint [n=2]), wire nails (n=4,
post-1890), and a roofing nail. Domestic items (n=43) include a piece of natural clay slipped
interior/exterior stoneware (1875–1900), light blue tinted whiteware (n=2, 1880–1930), pure
white whiteware (n=1, post-1890), bottle glass (amber/brown [n=4], clear with ash tint [n=6,
post-1915], and clear [n=20, post-1880]), table glass (clear [n=2, post-1880] and cobalt blue
[n=1]), a light green body sherd, a milk glass jar neck, a possible lid to a coffee percolator, two
73

rolled tin can rims, and one crimped tin can rim (post-1902). Furnishings are represented by a
piece of electric lamp glass. Personal items are represented by a snuff jar fragment and a snap or
grommet for fastening material. Activities-related items consist of a piece of bar iron with two
protruding rivets, interpreted as a machine part. Unidentifiable pieces of iron (n=13), a piece of
rubber, a piece of tar, and a piece of slate are classified as Indeterminate. The majority of the
assemblage (n=80) came from the 0–20 cmbs level; a machine-made brick and a glass fragment
were the only materials from the 20–40 cmbs level. Prehistoric artifacts from the site consist of
jasper debitage (n=1, 0–20 cmbs) and a possible fragment of a ground stone artifact or FCR (n=1,
40–60 cmbs), both recovered in Transect 2/Shovel Test 42 excavated on the eastern margin of a
prairie mound.
Although no historic structure is presently located within the APE or in the immediate vicinity,
the 1951 USGS De Kalb NW topographic map shows a primary structure within the presently
existing US 259 roadway (see inset on Figure 9). A structure is also represented in this location
on a 1918 USDA Bowie County soils map. It is likely that the historic artifacts recovered at
41BW767, adjacent to the former location of this structure, are associated with activities related
to the building indicated on historic maps. This structure was likely demolished prior to or during
construction of US 259 in the early 1960s. No architectural features were encountered within the
APE, but site 41BW767 likely extends to the northeast and southwest beyond the APE.

Recommendations
Site 41BW767 represents a domestic site (with two prehistoric artifacts) situated on a Pleistocene
terrace south of Mill Creek. Based on earlier maps and dateable historic material, the site was
probably occupied in the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, but the structure on historic
maps was likely demolished prior to the early 1960s. Although the site yielded a relatively high
artifact density, the portion of the site within the APE has little research potential due to the
degree of disturbance in the area and the relatively undistinguished artifact assemblage. No
further investigation of the portion of site 41BW767 within the APE is recommended.

SITE 41BW768 (WA 578 20 SA001 / CSJ 0085-04-034)

Current Investigations
Site 41BW768 is the fourth of five sites identified and recorded during cultural resources survey
in conjunction with the proposed project to widen an 11.9-mi segment of US 259 from just south
of the Oklahoma/Texas state line to just north of US 82 in De Kalb, Bowie County, Texas. The
site is plotted on the USGS De Kalb NW (33094-F6) 7.5' series quadrangle. The APE is defined
as the existing 61-m-wide maximum ROW, which is owned by the state of Texas. Fieldwork for
the cultural resources survey was undertaken in April and July 2010.
Site 41BW768 consists of a late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century artifact scatter situated in a
level portion of the Pleistocene terrace south of a low-lying, periodically inundated area (Figure
10). Vegetation in the area is a mixed hardwood-pine forest adjacent to US 259. The underlying
geology of the site area consists of Pleistocene Fluviatile Terrace deposits (BEG 1975). The area
is mapped as Smithdale fine sandy loam, but shovel tests indicated that the northern portion of the
75

site likely consists of a Wrightsville series inclusion. Soils in the northern portion of the site
consist of a thin (5 cm) dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) silt loam over a very pale brown (10YR
8/2) silt loam to a depth of approximately 14 cm, underlain by brown (10YR 5/3) clay with red
(2.5YR 5/8) mottles. Conversely, soils on the southern portion of the site are a more
homogeneous light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4) silt loam. The site has been affected by buried
utilities along its eastern margin, the construction and maintenance of US 259, and the managed
timberland to the south. An inundated area lies to the north, likely associated with an unnamed
tributary of Tanyard Creek.
Artifacts were recovered from 13 shovel tests in the eastern and western ROWs of the APE; the
eastern side of the APE at approximately 40 m north of the positive shovel tests was inundated
and disturbed and thus could not be shovel-tested. The site encompasses an area of
approximately 155 m NW-SE by 60 m E-W. Ten negative shovel tests defined the limits of the
site. A total of 95 historic artifacts was collected at site 41BW768. Architectural artifacts (n=54)
include brick (machine-made [n=1, post-1903] and handmade [n=49, pre-1903]), an iron
escutcheon plate, a cut nail (1840–1880), and two wire nails (post-1890). Domestic items (n=25)
are composed of a piece of Bristol-glazed interior/exterior stoneware (post-1900) and vessel glass
(amber/brown [n=8], aqua [n=1], clear [n=9], light green [n=1], light tint [n=2], and manganese
solarized [n=3]). Activities-related items include a fence staple, four Bakelite (1907–1940s)
fragments, and a modern plastic bottle cap (1942–present; 40–60 cmbs). An unidentifiable piece
of modern plastic (1942–present; 20–40 cmbs), three pieces of wire, two pieces of heavy metal,
and four pieces of thin metal were classified as Indeterminate. The majority of the assemblage
was recovered from the 0–40-cmbs levels. The 13 specimens from the lower 40–80 cmbs levels
(vessel glass fragments, a wire nail, the cut nail, six handmade brick fragments) mixed with the
modern plastic bottle cap suggest a disturbed context.
No historic structure is presently located in or near the APE, and no structures were indicated on
the 1951 USGS De Kalb NW topographic map or the 1918 USDA Bowie County soils map.
However, an old standing barn east of the current ROW is likely evidence that this site was
probably a farmstead. The site may extend outside of the APE to the east and west.

Recommendations
Site 41BW768, a late nineteenth- to early twentieth-century artifact scatter situated in a level
portion of the Pleistocene terrace south of a low-lying, periodically inundated area, may extend
outside of the APE. The site yielded a relatively high-density, but unremarkable, artifact
assemblage. The cultural material, in combination with the lack of features, no known historic
structure, and the degree of disturbance, suggests that the portion of the site within the APE has
little research potential. Therefore, no further investigation of the portion of site 41BW768
within the APE is recommended.

SITE 41BW769 (WA 578 20 SA001 / CSJ 0085-04-034)

Current Investigations
Site 41BW769 is the fifth site identified and recorded during cultural resources survey in
conjunction with the proposed project to widen an 11.9-mi segment of US 259 from just south of
the Oklahoma/Texas state line to just north of US 82 in De Kalb, Bowie County, Texas. The site
is plotted on the USGS Oak Grove (33094-E6) 7.5' series quadrangle. The APE is defined as the
existing 61-m-wide maximum ROW, which is owned by the state of Texas. Fieldwork for the
cultural resources survey was undertaken in April and June 2010.
Site 41BW769 is a prehistoric site (with minimal historic-era artifacts) situated on the north bank
and within the active floodplain of Mud Creek, which traverses through a gently undulating
prairie landscape (Figure 11). The site is in a state-maintained open prairie setting composed of
dense grasses and forbs. Vegetation adjacent to the site is primarily streamside oak and elm trees
with a moderate understory of ivy and vines. Open prairie grasses surround each quadrant.
Elevation at the site is approximately 358 ft amsl, and the site is located at the southern periphery
of a sequence of prairie mounds. Thenas fine sandy loam represents the majority if not all of the
soils at the site. A typical shovel test revealed 50 cm of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine loose
sand over 30 cm of yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) fine loose sand. US 259 has likely cut the site in
half since materials were found in the northwest and northeast quadrants. The US 259 road
crown has certainly affected any intact sediments immediately adjacent to the highway, and
utility lines running along the east side of US 259 may have disturbed the portion of the site in the
northeast quadrant.
The artifact assemblage from the site was recovered from eight positive shovel tests, with the site
boundary delineated within the APE by six negative shovel tests and the northern edge of Mud
Creek. The site covers a total area of approximately 55 m NW-SE by 57 m E-W. The cultural
assemblage consists of 34 artifacts: 29 lithics (two of which are chipped stone tools), two
prehistoric ceramics, a faunal bone, and two historic-era specimens. The lithics are primarily
debitage (biface thinning [n=8], decortication [n=10], indeterminate medial/distal fragments
[n=3], and shatter [n=6]). Raw material represented among the debitage is undifferentiated chert
(n=19), quartzite (5), siltstone (2), and translucent chert (n=1). Debitage was retrieved from 0–80
cmbs, with the majority (n=23) found from 0–60 cmbs. The two chipped stone tools are an
undifferentiated chert uniface with edge modification from Transect 2/Shovel Test 127 and a
quartzite biface fragment from Transect 2/Shovel Test 128; both tools came from the 40–60-cmbs
level. Also found in the same shovel test and level as the uniface were two untyped prehistoric
ceramic body vessel sherds, as well as a calcined animal long bone shaft. The sherds exhibit a
grit/grog temper and a smoothed exterior; wall thickness of both is 7 mm. The final two artifacts
from the site are a modern plastic (1942–present) machine part (Transect 2/Shovel Test 58; 20–40
cmbs) and an unidentifiable iron fragment (Transect 2/Shovel Test 64; 60–70 cmbs). It may be
noteworthy that the ferrous metal fragment was found 40 cm below debitage in Transect 2/Shovel
Test 64. This occurrence seems to indicate some degree of disturbance, although it is unclear
whether mixing is due to construction activities, or the natural translocation of materials vertically
through the sandy matrix because of the site location in the active floodplain of Mud Creek, or,
conversely, the possibility that the metal was actually in the upper horizons, accidently dislodged
from the sidewall of the shovel test unit and recovered at a lower depth. The last situation seems
most likely because no other historic or modern materials were found below prehistoric materials
78

in any of the other shovel tests. Although no intact cultural features were encountered during
shovel testing, charcoal flecking and a charcoal chunk were observed in three shovel tests
(Transect 1/Shovel Test 43, Transect 1/Shovel Test 58, and Transect 2/Shovel Test 64 from 0–70
cmbs). The piece of plastic machine part was found below the flecking in Transect 1/Shovel Test
58, but no prehistoric material was above it in the unit. In addition to hand-excavated units, two
trenches (BHTs 1 and 2) were excavated to 120 cmbs and 140 cmbs, respectively, but no deeply
buried living surfaces were identified in the profiles of either trench. The site, however, likely
extends beyond the APE to the east and west.

Recommendations
Prehistoric site 41BW769, on the north bank and within the active floodplain of Mud Creek, is in
a gently undulating prairie landscape and likely extends beyond the APE. US 259 has likely cut
the site in half since materials were found in the northwest and northeast quadrants and has
affected any intact sediments immediately adjacent to the highway. Additionally, utility lines
running along the east side of US 259 may have disturbed the portion of the site in the northeast
quadrant. Nonetheless, based on the recovery of chipped stone tools, ceramics, and burned bone,
all from 40–60 cmbs, and the possibility of relatively intact deposits—assuming that the
perceived mixing of the two historic artifacts with the prehistoric material is incidental to the
contextual integrity—the portion of the site within the APE may retain research potential relevant
to Archaic/Woodland/Late Prehistoric settlement and subsistence patterns in the uplands of the
Red River basin. Therefore, additional intensive archeological investigations are recommended
in the portion of 41BW769 within the APE to determine the presence, extent, and integrity of
intact cultural deposits.

SITE 41DT272 (WA 578 19 SA001 / CSJ 0136-03-044)

Current Investigations
Site 41DT272 is one of several sites identified during a 10.7-mi survey along SH 24 in Delta
County, plotted on the 1964 Cooper South (33095-C6) USGS 7.5' series quadrangle, to
investigate the plotted locations of mapped historic structures (MHSs). The existing ROW is
owned by the state of Texas; however, the proposed new ROW will extend onto privately owned
property. The APE for this project consists of the existing TxDOT ROW, which varies from
approximately 19 m to 76 m wide, and proposed new ROW that will be acquired primarily north
of the existing ROW. The new ROW will extend approximately 45 m beyond the existing ROW.
Fieldwork was undertaken in February 2010.
Site 41DT272, the location of MHS #15, consists of the remnants of a historic farmstead situated
within the APE in a privately owned plowed field west of CR 2110 and north of SH 24. The site
is in an upland edge setting on a slightly elevated area just east of the Johns Creek floodplain.
Most of the vegetation within the existing ROW consists of grasses and forbs with primarily
honey mesquite and eastern red cedar trees established along the property fence lines, but also
with some pastureland on private property within the APE. Vegetation along the streams is
primarily hardwoods, particularly oak, elm, mesquite, pecan, bois d‘arc, and locust trees, with a
dense understory of vines, briers, and ivy. The Johns Creek floodplain, in particular, is composed
80

predominantly of dense stands of locust trees. The majority of the existing ROW has been
affected by activities associated with the construction and maintenance of SH 24. A buried gas
line is present within the proposed new ROW north of SH 24 within the Johns Creek floodplain.
According to the BEG (1979), the area in the site vicinity is underlain by the Neylandville
Formation from the Hunt-Delta county line to the floodplain of Johns Creek and by Marlbrook
Marl Formation immediately to the northeast of the Johns Creek floodplain. Site 41DT272 is
plotted on Crockett loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Shovel Test 39 at site 41DT272
revealed 20 cm of brown clay over 40 cm of a disturbed soil context of gray clay with brownish
yellow and gray mottling.
Site 41DT272 was identified during a visit to the location of MHS #15 (Figure 12). The site
revealed a clearly visible surface scatter of numerous features and artifacts indicative of an early
to mid-twentieth-century historic farmstead. These features included a brick-lined well or cistern
(located outside the APE), a collapsed outhouse, a plow and associated components, and a
barbed-wire fence line with multiple enclosure areas extending from the foundation of a previous
structure into the adjacent Johns Creek floodplain to the west-southwest. Observed artifacts
consisted of several brick fragments, porcelain fragments, and Fiestaware fragments on the
ground surface surrounding the foundation. Since components of the site were clearly visible on
the surface, shovel testing at the site focused on the plowed field surrounding the foundation area
in order to determine if the site extended beyond the surface scatter and if cultivation practices
had destroyed portions of the site. Shovel Tests 20 and 39 were excavated in the plowed field, to
the east and to the north, respectively, of the foundation. Although no cultural materials were
recovered from the shovel tests, fragments of bricks and Fiestaware were observed scattered in
the plowed field, indicating that the contextual integrity of the site has been compromised to some
degree.
Site 41DT272 likely represents remnants of an early to mid-twentieth-century farmstead based on
some of the features observed within the estimated 150-x-30-m area that the site encompasses
within the current APE. The cultural materials observed on the surface at the site consisted of a
brick-lined well or cistern, a collapsed outhouse, gas line fittings, a fence line extending to the
southwest from the location of the structure foundation into the Johns Creek floodplain, as well as
numerous glass jars, gas drums, a porcelain fragment, a plow and associated metal fittings, and a
Fiestaware fragment. According to Huxford and Huxford (1992), the timeframe for Fiestaware
dates to between 1920 and 1950. The remainder of the observed items were also consistent with
the interpretation that 41DT272 represents an early to mid-twentieth-century historic farmstead.
Archival research, including a review of The Texas Historic Overlay (Foster et al. 2006), did not
yield any information regarding previous landowners or site use.
It is highly likely that site 41DT272 may represent one of the many locations of a former tenant
house dating to the early twentieth century. As such, this site could provide information
regarding the subsistence lifestyle of tenant farmers and their participation in the larger national
and world economies. However, similar historic sites have been documented during numerous
investigations at Cooper Lake (see Fields et al. 1997 for site summaries).

Recommendations
Although no cultural materials were recovered from the shovel tests, fragments of bricks and
Fiestaware were observed scattered in the plowed field, indicating that the contextual integrity of
the site has been compromised to some degree. The disturbed nature of the site within the APE
and the low density of subsurface artifacts limit the research potential (it appears that the most
productive area of the evaluated site potentially lies outside the present APE). Based on the
materials recovered from the portion of the site within the APE, it is unlikely that this site would
offer any research potential that has not been fulfilled by previous investigations. Based on the
findings described above, the portion of site 41DT272 within the APE does not meet the criteria
(36 CFR 60.4) for inclusion in the NRHP or the criteria (13 TAC 26.8) for designation as an
SAL. Therefore, no further investigation of the portion of the site within the APE is
recommended.

SITE 41DT273 (WA 578 19 SA001 / CSJ 0136-03-044)

Current Investigations
Site 41DT273 is the second of several sites identified during the 10.7-mi survey along SH 24 in
Delta County to investigate the plotted locations of MHSs. The site is plotted on the 1964
Klondike (33095-C7) USGS 7.5' series quadrangle. The existing ROW is owned by the state of
82

Texas; however, the proposed new ROW will extend onto privately owned property. The APE
for this project consists of the existing TxDOT ROW, which varies from approximately 19.2 m to
76.2 m wide, and proposed new ROW that will be acquired primarily north of the existing ROW.
The new ROW will extend approximately 45.7 m beyond the existing ROW. Fieldwork was
undertaken in February and March 2010.
Site 41DT273, the locations of MHS #5, was recorded as the remnants of a historic-era farmstead
situated within the APE on privately owned land east of McCombs Hill Road and north of SH
24.. The site is in an upland setting west of the Jernigan Creek floodplain and is located on
private property in a maintained area among scattered historic oak trees. The site is
approximately 50 m southwest of a large pond. The BEG (1979) maps the area in the site vicinity
as underlain by the Neylandville Formation. The site is plotted on Crockett loam, 1 to 3 percent
slopes (NRCS 2010). Shovel tests near the foundation revealed approximately 20 cm of very
dark grayish brown to brown silt loam over approximately 20 cm of yellowish to grayish brown
silty clay with mottles. The majority of the existing ROW has been affected by activities
associated with the construction and maintenance of SH 24.
Site 41DT273 was encountered near the recorded location of MHS #5 (Figure 13). Evidence of a
previous structure at the location of MHS #5 was represented by the presence of a modern tool
shed constructed on top of a concrete foundation with a front porch protruding from the base of
the shed. Conversations with the landowners revealed that this particular area has been occupied
for more than 100 years and that the foundation and front porch indeed belonged to a structure
present prior to 1936. Further attesting to the legitimacy of this communication was the presence
of numerous large oak trees lined with historic-age bricks and a stand of several cypress trees
planted over 100 years ago below the dam of a small man-made lake on the property. A shovel
test (Shovel Test 15) was excavated immediately south-southeast of the front porch to search for
further evidence of MHS #5. The shovel test yielded an iron fragment, a charcoal fragment, and a
carbonized deer-sized bone fragment between 0 and 20 cmbs, and a natural clay slip ceramic
fragment between 20 and 40 cmbs. The B horizon, a brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay with red
(2.5YR 5/6) and light gray (10YR 7/1) mottles, was encountered below this lowest zone. Further
personal communication with the landowners revealed that historic artifacts such as those
recovered from Shovel Test 15 have been observed throughout the area surrounding the modern
residence immediately adjacent to MHS #5. This information prompted the placement of a total
of seven additional shovel tests roughly paralleling SH 24 to the west-northwest and eastnortheast of Shovel Test 15 to determine the lateral extent of cultural deposits. Two positive
shovel tests (Shovel Tests 17 and 18) were excavated 10–15 m to the west-northwest of Shovel
Test 15. Historic materials recovered from these units consisted of nails and glass fragments, and
a single interior chert flake found between 0 and 20 cmbs in Shovel Test 17, excavated 15 m
west-northwest of Shovel Test 16. To expedite the delineation process, the spacing of shovel
tests near MHS #5 was expanded to 20 m and 30 m in order to determine the lateral extent of
cultural deposits in the area. Two shovel tests (Shovel Tests 25 and 26) were placed 20 m and
40 m to the west-northwest of Shovel Test 18, respectively, and both returned negative results,
thus delineating the area in this direction. Next, Shovel Tests 27 and 28 were excavated 20 m and
40 m to the east-northeast of Shovel Test 15, respectively. Shovel Test 27 yielded three nails and
two glass fragments between 0 and 15 cmbs, and a B horizon similar to that encountered in
Shovel Test 15 was found directly below this. Shovel Test 28 did not yield any cultural
materials, and the dam of the small man-made lake was approached immediately to the eastnortheast of this unit, thus delineating the area in that direction. Delineation to the north of
Shovel Test 15 was terminated by the presence of the tool shed and the northern boundary of the

APE, and delineation to the south was terminated by disturbances within the existing ROW; the
estimated site area within the APE is approximately 50-x-20 m. The only dateable item
recovered from 41DT273 was a natural clay slip ceramic fragment that falls within the 1875–
1900 time range. This timeframe is consistent with the oral histories provided by the current
residents of the private property where the site was discovered.
The concrete foundation of MHS #5 is still intact and the front porch is clearly visible; however, a
tool shed has recently been constructed on top of the foundation, compromising the integrity of
the site. Surrounding the historic-era foundation at the site are numerous large oak trees that
according to local residents are around 100 years old. The natural clay slip ceramic fragment
from Shovel Test 15 directly adjacent to the front porch also indicates a timeframe of site use
between approximately 1875 and 1900.
As with site 41DT272, site 41DT273 may represent one of the numerous locations of a former
tenant house dating to the early twentieth century. Although this site could provide information
regarding the subsistence lifestyle of tenant farmers and their participation in the larger national
and world economies, similar historic sites have been documented during numerous
investigations at Cooper Lake (see Fields et al. 1997 for site summaries).

84

Recommendations
The disturbed nature of the site within the APE and the low density of subsurface artifacts limit
the research potential; the most productive area of the evaluated site potentially lies outside the
present APE. Based on the materials recovered from the portion of the site within the APE, it is
unlikely that this site would offer any research potential that has not been fulfilled by previous
investigations. Based on the findings described above, the portion of site 41DT273 within the
APE does not meet the criteria (36 CFR 60.4) for inclusion in the NRHP or the criteria (13 TAC
26.8) for designation as an SAL. Therefore, no further investigation of the portion of the site
within the APE is recommended.

SITE 41DT274 (WA 578 19 SA001 / CSJ 0136-03-044)

Current Investigations
Site 41DT274 is the third of several sites identified during the 10.7-mi survey along SH 24,
plotted on the USGS 1964 Klondike (33095-C7) 7.5' series quadrangle, in Delta County to
investigate the plotted locations of MHSs. The existing ROW is owned by the state of Texas;
however, the proposed new ROW will extend onto privately owned property. The APE for this
project consists of the existing TxDOT ROW, which varies from approximately 19 m to 76 m
wide, and proposed new ROW that will be acquired primarily north of the existing ROW. The
new ROW will extend approximately 45 m beyond the existing ROW. Fieldwork was
undertaken in February 2010.
Similar to site 41DT273, which is approximately 475 m to the southwest, 41DT274 is situated
within the APE on privately owned land east of McCombs Hill Road and north of SH24. The site
is in an upland setting west of the Jernigan Creek floodplain and is located on private property
among scattered historic oak trees. The site is approximately 100 m southeast a large pond. The
BEG (1979) maps the area in the site vicinity as underlain by the Neylandville Formation. The
site is plotted on Woodtell loam, 5 to 12 percent slopes (NRCS 2010). Soil profiles in the shovel
tests excavated at 41DT274 were somewhat similar and consisted of very dark brown (10YR 2/2)
and very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) loamy topsoils grading into sandy clay B horizons,
although the B horizon in Shovel Test 29 was encountered at 60 cmbs as opposed to 30 and 40
cmbs in Shovel Tests 31 and 30, respectively. The majority of the existing ROW has been
affected by activities associated with the construction and maintenance of SH 24.
A visit to the plotted location of MHS #6 prompted the discovery of site 41DT274, which is a
historic-era site with a minimal prehistoric component (Figure 14). Shovel Test 29 was
excavated approximately 5 m north-northwest of the current ca. 1950 residential structure where
MHS #6 is located. The shovel test yielded burned glass fragments, mirror glass, concrete chunks
(one with the embossed letter ―B‖) between 0 and 20 cmbs; and glass, two chert flakes, and a
quartzite flake between 20 and 40 cmbs. Between 40 and 60 cmbs, a single glass fragment was
recovered. It is unclear whether the mixing of historic and prehistoric artifacts was the result of
glass fragments falling into deeper levels from the sidewall of the upper layers, or if the mixing
was the result of disturbances associated with a buried water line that was within 1–2 m of the
shovel test. Shovel Tests 30 and 45 were excavated 15 m and 30 m east-northeast, respectively,
of Shovel Test 29 but did not yield any cultural materials. These two tests delineated the site to

the east-northeast. Shovel Test 31 was then excavated approximately 25 m to the west of Shovel
Test 29. The interval was expanded there to avoid a storm cellar. The shovel test yielded an
unidentified modern, sawed bone fragment in the upper 20 cmbs. At this point, Shovel Test 31
was near the edge of the northern boundary of the APE, so shovel testing ceased in that direction.
Delineation to the north and south of Shovel Test 29 was prevented by the presence of the
northern APE boundary and by the residence south of Shovel Test 29; the estimated site area
within the APE is approximately 25-x-10 m.
Excavations at site 41DT274 produced two positive shovel test results. Shovel Test 29 yielded a
mixed assemblage of historic and prehistoric artifacts. Glass fragments were found in the same
levels as lithic debitage; however, it is unclear whether the glass was intrusive from the sidewall
of upper levels or if disturbances associated with an adjacent buried water line was responsible
for the mixed assemblage. Either way, no temporally diagnostic materials were found, and the
archeological materials appear to be isolated in nature. Oral history documentation from local
residents of the property where site 41DT274 was discovered indicates that the area has been
utilized for over 100 years, although the names of the previous owners remain unclear.
As with sites 41DT272 and 41DT273, site 41DT274 may represent one of the numerous locations
of a former tenant house dating to the early twentieth century. Although this site could provide
information regarding the subsistence lifestyle of tenant farmers and their participation in the
larger national and world economies, similar historic sites have been documented during
numerous investigations at Cooper Lake (see Fields et al. 1997 for site summaries).

86

Recommendations
The disturbed nature of site 41DT274 within the APE and the low density of subsurface artifacts,
as well as the lack of any temporal artifacts, limit the research potential. Additionally, because of
the location of the positive shovel tests at the northern APE boundary, it is highly possible the
most productive area of the evaluated site potentially lies outside the present APE. Based on the
materials recovered from the portion of the site within the APE, it is unlikely that this site would
offer any research potential that has not been fulfilled by previous investigations. Therefore, the
portion of site 41DT274 within the APE does not meet the criteria (36 CFR 60.4) for inclusion in
the NRHP or the criteria (13 TAC 26.8) for designation as an SAL. Thus, no further investigation
of the portion of the site within the APE is recommended.

SITE 41DT275 (WA 578 19 SA001 / CSJ 0136-03-044)

Current Investigations
Site 41DT275 is the fourth and last of the sites identified during the 10.7-mi survey along SH 24
in Delta County, plotted on the USGS 1964 Klondike (33095-C7) 7.5' series quadrangle, to
investigate the plotted locations of MHSs. The existing ROW is owned by the state of Texas;
however, the proposed new ROW will extend onto privately owned property. The APE for this
project consists of the existing TxDOT ROW, which varies from approximately 19 m to 76 m
wide, and proposed new ROW that will be acquired primarily north of the existing ROW. The
new ROW will extend approximately 45 m beyond the existing ROW. Fieldwork was
undertaken in February 2010.
Site 41DT275 is a historic-era site situated east of Jernigan Creek. The site is within the northern
APE on privately owned land in an upland setting. The area surrounding the site is in a
maintained farmhouse yard. The BEG (1979) maps the area in the site vicinity as underlain by
the Neylandville Formation. The site is plotted on Wilson silty loam 0–2, percent slopes (NRCS
2010). The soil profile from the shovel test revealed 0–35 cmbs of very dark grayish brown silty
clay, over 35–80 cmbs of very dark grayish brown clay with yellowish red mottles. The majority
of the existing ROW has been affected by activities associated with the construction and
maintenance of SH 24.
Investigation at the location of MHS #10 produced a single positive shovel test (Shovel Test 19)
(Figure 15). This test yielded artifacts consisting of an unidentified modern, sawed bone
fragment; a portion of a plastic bag; a white plastic fragment; and a clear plastic fragment with
―New York‖ printed on it. These items were determined to be recent refuse, and no other shovel
tests were excavated near MHS #10. However, the area was assigned the site number 41DT275
due to the presence of a storm cellar and a well or cistern likely associated with the historic
structure mapped on the 1936 General Highway Map of Delta County, Texas. No further work
was performed in this area because the highest probability of finding cultural materials was
farther to the north beyond the northern boundary of the APE.

Figure 15. Plan map of site 41DT275 (CSJ 0136-03-044).

Site 41DT275 corresponds to a cistern or well and a storm cellar (within an estimated site area of
approximately 20-x-20 m within the APE), representative of an early to mid-twentieth-century
farmstead likely representing MHS #10. Shovel Test 19 was excavated near the MHS, but only
modern refuse was found in the shovel test between 0 and 20 cmbs. No temporally diagnostic
cultural materials were recovered from 41DT275. Deed history research of the property indicates
that the structure mapped on the 1936 Highway Map of Delta County, Texas was built in 1900
and is currently owned by Anthony Peters; however, no other information was found regarding
the property.
As with sites 41DT272, 41DT273, 41DT274, it is highly likely that site 41DT275 may represent
the location of a former tenant house dating to the early twentieth century, as with many of the
other MHSs along SH 24. As such, these locations could provide information regarding the
subsistence lifestyle of tenant farmers and their participation in the larger national and world
economies. However, similar historic sites have been documented during the numerous
investigations at Cooper Lake (see Fields et al. 1997 for site summaries).

Recommendations
It appears that the most productive area of the evaluated site potentially lies outside the present
APE. The disturbed nature of the site within the APE and the low density of subsurface artifacts
limit the research potential. Based on the modern refuse recovered from the portion of the site
within the APE, it is unlikely that this site would offer any research potential that has not been
88

fulfilled by previous investigations. Therefore, the portion of site 41DT275 within the APE does
not meet the criteria (36 CFR 60.4) for inclusion in the NRHP or the criteria (13 TAC 26.8) for
designation as an SAL. Thus, no further investigation of the portion of the site within the APE is
recommended.

SITES 41HS13 AND 41HS915 (WA 578 1 SA001 / CSJ 0843-07-012)

Previous Investigations
Site 41HS13 was initially recorded in 1962 as a Caddo mortuary site and plotted on the Atlas
west of the Potters Creek Relief channel, immediately north of FM 2625, with the possibility that
part of the site extended into the proposed highway construction APE. Although local relic
hunters had been aware of the site for many years and had looted much of the site prior to its
recording, the site was first recorded as a Protohistoric/historic Caddo mortuary site (Duffield
1962). James Corbin reexamined the site in 1992 during a survey for a gas pipeline and identified
a possibly earlier nonmortuary component consisting of a deposit of lithic flakes, burned rock,
and charcoal flecks. He also speculated that the mortuary component had been largely, if not
completely, destroyed (Corbin 1992b).

Current Investigations
Site 41HS13 was revisited in conjunction with a bridge rehabilitation project at Potters Creek and
Potters Creek Relief along FM 2625. All impacts from the proposed TxDOT project will be
confined to the state-owned existing 44.2-m-wide ROW, which comprises the APE for this
project. The centroid of site 41HS13, on the 1983 Darco, Texas, 7.5' series USGS quadrangle, is
situated in the floodplain west of Potters Creek Relief in Harrison County, approximately 45 m
north of FM 2625. As plotted on the 1992 Atlas site form (Corbin 1992b), the southern boundary
of site 41HS13 likely extends into the northern APE area. Investigators attempted to locate and
evaluate any portion of site 41HS13 within the project APE during survey. At the conclusion of
fieldwork, the excavated cluster of positive shovel tests east of the relief channel and
approximately 145 m east of the plotted location for site 41HS13 was considered to be a separate
site, and this area was assigned the trinomial 41HS915. Geo-Marine, Inc., archeologists
conducted fieldwork on May 7, 2008, and May 27–28, 2008, within the proposed project APE.
According to the present Work Authorization, the Caddo have informed TxDOT that they
consider the area sacred.
Approximately 60 percent of the surveyed area surrounding site 41HS13 is covered with grass,
wildflowers, and blackberry vines. Secondary forest flanks the APE and partially extends into the
ROW to constitute the remaining 40 percent of the major vegetation types. Within the floodplain
is a generalized forest of oak, elm, hickory, sweet gum, and pine on the north side. A moderately
dense understory of poison ivy, Virginia creeper, greenbrier, and other vines occurs within the
tree lines. The underlying geology of the site area consists of Holocene Alluvium within the
floodplain (BEG 1975). The area is mapped as Iuka fine sandy loam, frequently flooded (Golden
et al. 1994). Shovel Test NW 9, approximately 30 m south of the plotted datum for site 41HS13
and just within the northern edge of the APE, revealed 20 cm of brown (10YR 5/3) silty clay
loam, above 30 cm of gray (10YR 6/1) clay with strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) streaks and mottles.
89

Shovel Test SC 4, to the east and south of the highway between the creek and the relief channel
(in the area designated as site 41HS915), revealed dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6) sandy loam
throughout the excavated depth (0–80 cmbs). The ROW is mostly open grass but it extends
approximately 5 m into the tree lines of the forest along both sides of the roadway. The grasscovered roadbed descends sharply into the floodplain, but the portion of the floodplain between
the two creek channels is slightly higher in elevation than the areas flanking the two channels. A
two-track road extends across the east half of the ROW segment (within 41HS915) between the
two channels north of the highway and east of the plotted location of 41HS13. Shovel testing
along both sides of the roadway indicated that within the floodplain the portions of the ROW
outside and often also along the edge of the tree lines are disturbed.
Shovel testing within the floodplain initially focused on the north side of the highway closest to
the recorded location of 41HS13 (Figure 16). The west side of the relief channel where that site
is plotted could only accommodate two shovel tests spaced 20 m apart on the north side of the
road between standing waters and an access road to a gas pipeline (see Figure 16). One unit was
excavated on the south side of the road. None of the three units yielded cultural material.
The remaining 20 shovel tests in the vicinity of site 41HS13 were placed to the east of the relief
channel: eight on the north side of the road and 12 on the south side. The row of shovel tests
spaced 20 m apart was excavated as far to the north of the ROW as possible, usually less than 5 m
south of the property fence. South of the highway, a row of shovel tests was excavated across the
segment between the two creek channels along the edge of the tree line, and shovel test intervals
were widened to 30 m because of the distance from the recorded site location and the absence of
undisturbed artifact deposits to the north. Despite this presumption, a shovel test yielded an
artifact in a relatively undisturbed context and necessitated a series of delineation shovel tests to
the east, west, and south. Delineation shovel tests were generally spaced in 10-m intervals until
artifacts were no longer encountered.
In total, six artifacts, all chert flakes, were recovered from five positive shovel tests east of Potters
Creek Relief within the floodplain southeast of the plotted location of site 41HS13. The positive
shovel tests were typically inside the tree line (see Figure 16). Four shovel tests within the
floodplain between the two creek channels south of the highway (Shovel Test SC 4 and its
delineation tests, Shovel Tests SC4 S5, SC4 S5 W10, SC4 S5 W20) each produced one chert
flake between 20 and 70 cmbs. One shovel test north of the road (Shovel Test NC 2) produced
two chert flakes, but these were recovered from the upper 10 cm of the unit in a mixed context
with three fragments of thin metal from a tin or can. No additional artifacts were identified in the
other shovel tests excavated south of the plotted position of site 41HS13 west of the channel or to
the southeast between the two channels on the north or south sides of the highway.
Previous investigations identified site 41HS13 on a low rise west of the Potters Creek Relief
channel and north of FM 2625. The chert debitage recovered during the present examination of
the area was consistent with the type of archeological materials observed in the nonmortuary
component of the site by Corbin in 1992. Therefore, the positive shovel tests encountered during
the present occupation were initially interpreted as an extension of 41HS13. It was also
considered possible that the relief channel either did not present a year-round obstacle when the
site was occupied/utilized, or the channel did not exist in prehistory. However, the relief channel
and more than 100 m, including 12 negative shovel tests, separated the positive shovel tests
encountered during the present investigation from the documented site location. Thus, TxDOT
revised this same-site interpretation to conclude that the more recently excavated cluster of shovel

90

tests east of the relief channel is a separate site. The new site has been assigned the trinomial
41HS915, with an estimated site area within the APE of approximately 75-x-25 m, stretching
northeast–southwest across FM 2625.
The materials recovered at 41HS915 from the north side of the highway are clearly in a disturbed
context, and those to the south are sparse, lack diagnostic artifacts, and offer little research
potential. The deepest buried artifact was recovered in Shovel Test SC 4 S5 at 70 cmbs. The unit
was excavated to 100 cmbs, but no other artifacts were recovered. The other undisturbed positive
shovel tests were sterile below 60 cmbs, and all were excavated to 80 cmbs. The potential exists
for undisturbed deposits within the privately owned properties adjacent to the ROW where
artifacts were identified during the present investigation; however, this possibility cannot be
explored at present because the material is outside the limits of the present project and not subject
to the National Historic Preservation Act or the Antiquities Code of Texas.

Recommendations
Shovel test results showed that construction of the bridges and present highway alignment has
disturbed part of 41HS915. Artifacts were recovered between the two creek channels on both
sides of the highway, although those encountered to the north were in a disturbed context. A
narrow (approximately 5 m) strip of undisturbed soils south of the highway yielded artifacts, but
these were few in number and limited to debitage, thus offering little research potential. The
potential exists for undisturbed deposits within the privately owned properties adjacent to the
ROW where artifacts were identified during the present investigation, but at present, this area
could not be assessed because it was outside the limits of the present project. The portion of
41HS915 within the APE does not meet the criteria as enumerated under 36 CFR 60.4 and 13
TAC 26.8 to qualify for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL and is recommended
not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Thus, no further
archeological work will be necessary as per 36 CFR 800.5(b) and 13 TAC 26.2 within the
currently investigated portion of site 41HS915.
No indication of material associated with site 41HS13 was found within the current APE.
Nonetheless, should impacts extend beyond the currently investigated ROW, monitoring of the
site 41HS13 area is recommended.

SITE 41HS559 (WA 578 20 SA001 / CSJ 0843-02-012)

Previous Investigations
According to the Atlas, prehistoric site 41HS559 was recorded at the northern end of Little
Cypress Bayou on a low rise above the floodplain by local avocational archeologist Marshall
McIntosh in 1994, and information regarding the site is restricted to his surface observations. As
recorded, the site was a surface scatter of lithic artifacts (dart and arrow projectile points, lithic
flaking debris) and pottery sherds located partially within the FM 450 proposed ROW. The
scatter of artifactual materials was observed in association with the southern dam of a large fish
hatchery near the northern end of Little Cypress Bayou. The recorder suspected that the majority
of the site had been disturbed by construction of the dam, but he suggested that an intact portion
of the site might remain within the proposed ROW APE.
92

Current Investigations
Site 41HS559 was partially investigated—only within the state-owned ROW—during the current
cultural resources survey for the proposed project to realign FM 450 and replace the bridge at
Little Cypress Creek, which is in the center of the Little Cypress Creek valley, in Harrison
County. Site 41HS559 is on the Harleton (32094-F5) USGS 7.5' series topographic quadrangle.
The APE for this project is the existing state-owned ROW, approximately 24.4 m wide from the
centerline of FM 450, but additional proposed ROW will be acquired from private landowners
west of FM 450. The site center is plotted west of the proposed ROW, but the site extends into
the project APE within both the proposed ROW and state-owned land. At the time of survey,
access to the proposed ROW on private property had not been granted, and the site was in an
inundated area. Fieldwork was undertaken March 29–31, 2010.
Site 41HS559 is situated near the northern end of Little Cypress Bayou, on the southern side of a
dam that is part of a large fish hatchery. The overstory along Little Cypress Bayou consists of
pine, oak, and sparse juniper trees. Dense hydrophilic understory vegetation exists over the
majority of the bayou. The site is in the hardwood forest, which itself is within the inundated
bayou. Both the main channel and an intermittent cutoff channel of Little Cypress Creek intersect
the project area near the tight bend in FM 450 approximately 400 m south of the site location.
The underlying geology of the Little Cypress Creek valley is mapped as undifferentiated
Quaternary Alluvium (BEG 1975), and the soil in the site area is mapped as Socagee silty clay
loam, frequently flooded. Shovel Test 20, which is one of the closest shovel tests to the site plot
and excavated to 50 cmbs, revealed 5 cm of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) root mat, over 15 cm of
yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam, over 30 cm of dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy
loam, saturated, gley; water was encountered at 50 cmbs.
An examination of USGS topographic maps indicates that the fish hatchery was constructed
between 1961 and 1978. There do not appear to have been additional significant land
modifications to the area since its construction. The current ROW was found to be moderately
disturbed from a road berm and ditch. All shovel tests within the current ROW were placed at the
edge of the ROW where disturbance was thought to be the most minimal. Shovel tests were
approximately 30 cm in diameter with a planned excavated depth of 80 cmbs or until bedrock or
water was encountered. Shovel test fill was screened through 0.25-inch hardware cloth, and data
about the soils and shovel test contents were recorded on a standardized form. Shovel test
locations were recorded with a handheld GPS unit. During survey current, the ROW was found
to be moderately disturbed from a road berm and ditch, and soils were found to be extremely
saturated; within the immediate area of site 41HS559, the ground was completely inundated
outside of the current ROW.
Due to the proximity of site 41HS559 to the fish hatchery, the northern portion of Little Cypress
Bayou was shovel-tested at 30-m intervals (Figure 17). Shovel Tests 4–20 were all excavated
within the current ROW on both sides of the road near the hatchery and the plotted location of
site 41HS559. Standing water in many shovel tests prevented the practicality of excavating many
of the shovel tests to 80 cmbs. No cultural materials were found in any of the shovel tests.
Nonetheless, the possibility remains that cultural materials from the site exist within the proposed
ROW, which was not investigated because of lack of access to private property.

93

Recommendations
Based on the current observations and previous findings, additional investigation is needed in the
plotted site area within the privately owned proposed ROW when access is obtained and during a
drier season.

SITE 41TT108 (WA 578 1 SA001 / CSJ 3404-01-011)

Previous Investigations
Milton Bell of the former Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation
(SDHPT), now TxDOT, recorded this site in 1978 as an open multicomponent prehistoric
campsite (75-x-90 m) and collected petrified wood, chipped stone flakes, and bone from the
surface (Bell 1978). SDHPT tested the site in 1980. At that time, the site was considered to
consist of two Archaic components and two Caddo components, including a pre-bow-and-arrow
Caddo I occupation (Young 1981), although more recent interpretations would regard the site as
consisting of Late Archaic, Woodland, and Formative/Early Caddo components. Recovered
materials included chipped stone tools and cores, debitage, ground stone tools, burned rock,
pottery, faunal materials, and one human burial (Young 1981). The Atlas indicates that site
41TT108 is a designated SAL.

Current Investigations
Site 41TT108 is plotted just north of state-owned existing highway ROW for AM 3417 in Titus
County on the 1968 (1976) Harvard, Texas, 7.5' series USGS quadrangle. The APE for the
TxDOT bridge rehabilitation project on FM 3417 at Tankersley Creek varies from approximately
49 m to 76 m. Because the southern boundary of the site likely extends into the northern APE
area, investigators attempted to locate and evaluate any portion of the site within the project APE
during survey. The current fieldwork was conducted in May 2008.
As plotted on the Atlas, site 41TT108 extends into or is adjacent to the project APE. The site is
plotted west of Tankersley Creek and north of FM 3417 on the toe of a low, gently sloping terrace
overlooking the floodplain of the creek. Mixed hardwoods and brush line the creek and its
channels to the east. The site, as plotted west of the channel, is at the edge of a forested area of
mixed hardwoods and brush, but vegetation within the ROW to the south of the plotted location is
almost entirely knee high grasses and wildflowers. Elevated areas occur inside the ROW, and
although the slopes of these elevations appear to have been mechanically altered by construction
of the present highway alignment, the tops appear to be largely undisturbed.
The underlying geology of the area is Holocene Alluvium within the floodplain, which is flanked
to the west by the Eocene period Wilcox Group undivided (BEG 1979). Soils in the area consist
primarily of Wolfpen loamy fine sand, 2 to 5 percent slopes (Roberts 1990:103). The profile of
Shovel Test NW 6, near the site center, revealed yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam to 40
cmbs, over 20 cm of light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), over 20 cm of yellowish brown (10YR
5/4) sandy loam, with mottled clay near 80 cmbs. The roadbed is elevated, and ground
disturbance was evident in the open area outside the APE, west of a wooded property.
95

Nineteen shovel tests were placed west of Tankersley Creek on the north side of the highway
closest to the plotted location of site 41TT108 (Figure 18). A single transect of east-to-west
shovel tests was excavated along the visibly undisturbed portion of the landform, typically 1–5 m
south of the property fence. Shovel test intervals, initially to be spaced at 30 m, were reduced to
10 m when stone flakes were encountered in Shovel Test NW 2 in the east. Two delineation
shovel tests spaced at 10-m intervals were also excavated to the east. Intervals to the west of
Shovel Test NW7 were increased to 20 m after several consecutive positive shovel tests
suggested that the site would extend a great distance farther. Shovel testing to the west
terminated after three consecutive sterile shovel tests and the landform began to descend toward a
drainage culvert.
Seven shovel tests yielded cultural materials, indicating that site 41TT108 extends into the
existing highway ROW. All of these materials were recovered from public property inside the
state-owned highway ROW, and all were collected. Lithic debitage constituted the primary class
(76 percent) of the 25 artifacts recovered. Of these 19 flakes, 16 were quartzite, two were chert,
and one was hematite. Burned sandstone (n=5) was the second most common artifact class (20
percent), and a piece of petrified wood of undetermined function constituted the remaining 4
percent of the recovered artifacts. Artifact density averaged 3.6 objects per positive shovel test;
Shovel Test NW 3 and Shovel Test NW 8 contained the highest number of recovered materials
(n=6 each). Artifacts were recovered from depths of 0–60 cmbs with most (n=13) occurring
between 40 and 60 cmbs. All archeological materials were confined to the knoll, which
demonstrated two high areas. Interestingly, the two shovel tests excavated between these high
spots were sterile. Four shovel tests excavated along the south slope of the knoll contained
disturbed soils mixed with modern materials. Fragments of modern bottle glass were recovered
from the two shovel tests excavated south of Shovel Test NW 2, and a piece of plastic, probably
from a drinking tumbler, was observed in the fill of Shovel Test 3 S5. Chunks of asphalt were
present in the bottom of Shovel Test NW 3 S10.
The south slope of the knoll in the northwest quadrant demonstrated compromised integrity
because of artificial contouring during road construction, and shovel tests south of Shovel Test
NW 2 and Shovel Test NW 3 contained mixed soils and modern trash, indicating disturbance in
this area. However, typically 10 m of the landform south of the property fence along the top of
the landform demonstrated intact natural soils that frequently exceeded 50 cm in depth, and this
area indicated contextual integrity. Shovel tests along the knoll on the west side of the private
road indicated sandy loam deposits that ranged from 10–45 cmbs before clay subsoil was
encountered. The thicker deposits were farther to the west and suggest that possibly construction
of the current FM 3417 alignment removed significant portions of the original surface soils.

Recommendations
Site 41TT108 is a designated SAL. Whether disturbance to the portion of the site that extends
into the current project area will affect the site‘s status is presently unclear. Artifact
concentration was low to moderate within the positive shovel tests, and diagnostic materials were
not recovered. However, several shovel tests spanning roughly 100 linear m contained artifacts,
and over half the recovered artifacts were concentrated at depths greater than 40 cmbs, therefore
suggesting intact deposits cover an extensive area. Aside from modern trash, only lithic materials
were recovered and might indicate the Archaic component of the site‘s occupation.
Archeological materials appeared to be restricted within the ROW to an undisturbed 10-m-wide
96

strip along the top of the knoll north of the highway west of the creek. In the event that proposed
construction extends north of the presently disturbed portions of the ROW, further evaluation of
this strip should be undertaken to determine whether it contributes to the overall significance of
site 41TT108 as enumerated under 34 CFR 60.4 and 26 TAC 26.8 and whether any impacts to it
will affect the overall status of the site pursuant to 36 CFR 800.5(a)(1) and 26 TAC 26.8. If it is
determined that the area will not be affected or can be avoided, no further archeological work will
be necessary as per 36 CFR 800.5(b).

CHAPTER 6
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

RESULTS
Fifteen work authorizations were issued under TxDOT Contract No. 578 xx SA001 (see Table 2)
for two impact evaluations and 33 archeological surveys (with two CSJs involving additional
field work, making 35 total field projects); the final work authorization included the production of
this report. The 35 field projects were conducted in the Atlanta (n=22), Dallas (n=3), and Paris
(n=10) districts. The two impact evaluations were for bridge replacements. The archeological
surveys were in conjunction with the following transportation activities:
3 bridge rehabilitations
22 bridge replacements (two of which were impact evaluations; and two with additional test
excavations or trenching)
1 bridge replacement with road widening
1 pavement reconstruction with an associated impact evaluation
1 road realignment with bridge replacement
4 road widenings (one with scraping along outside of cemetery fence)
1 for construction of temporary haul roads and drill pads associated with bridge construction
2 post-review discovery investigations
The fieldwork for these investigations in the three TxDOT districts was undertaken under Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 4815. Individual interim reports were coordinated with the THC
through TxDOT Environmental Affairs Division. Artifact collections taken from state property
and from private property with the landowner‘s consent as well as all associated notes and
materials are curated at TARL, University of Texas at Austin.
Fourteen sites were revisited or newly recorded during this contract. Preliminary archival
research revealed four previously recorded sites plotted within or extending into highway ROWs
within proposed project areas. Two of these sites (41BW166 and 41TT108) were found to extend
into the project APEs. Of the two other sites, no evidence of 41HS13 was found within the APE
because the site did not extend into the ROW, and access to the plotted location of 41HS559 in
the proposed ROW was not granted by the landowner (only the small portion of the site within
the existing state-owned ROW was investigated). The remaining 10 sites—41BW761,
99

41BW766, 41BW767, 41BW768, 41BW769, 41DT272, 41DT273, 41DT274, 41DT275, and
41HS915—were newly recorded during this contract.
Among the 14 sites or portions of sites identified within the project APEs, four (41BW761,
41BW766, 41HS13, and 41HS559) are prehistoric, and three (41BW768, 41DT272, and
41DT275) are historic-era occupations. Six sites yielded both prehistoric and historic remains—
predominantly prehistoric (sites 41BW166, 41BW769, 41HS915, and 41TT108) with very
minimal (one to three) pieces of historic material; and predominantly historic (41BW767,
41DT273, and 41DT274) with limited (one to three) prehistoric artifacts.
Ten of the sites yielded solely subsurface material (41BW166, 41BW761, 41BW766, 41BW767,
41BW768, 41BW769, 41DT273, 41DT274, 41HS915, and 41TT108). Site 41DT272 exhibited
only a historic surface scatter with structural features, and site 41DT275 was identified merely by
structural remains. Site 41HS13 yielded no cultural materials within the surveyed APE but was
originally recorded as a lithic scatter with FCR and charcoal flecks. The landowner did not grant
full access to the plotted location of site 41HS559, which was originally recorded as a surface
scatter of debitage and pottery sherds.
All of these sites likely extend beyond the investigated APEs, but those areas beyond the APEs
were not inspected. Therefore, only the portions of the sites within the APEs can be evaluated for
NRHP and SAL eligibility, and thus, recommendations apply only to the site portions within the
APEs. Further investigations are recommended to determine the presence, extent, and integrity of
intact cultural deposits for the portions of prehistoric sites 41BW166 and 41BW769 within the
APE, because these sites may contain intact features, a relative degree of contextual integrity, or
varied artifact classes and retain research potential. Although no additional investigation of site
41HS13 within the APE is recommended, this site should be monitored if future impacts extend
beyond the currently investigated ROW. Site 41HS559 is partially on property to which access
was not granted, and therefore, since only the site area on state-owned ROW was inspected,
further investigation of this site will be necessary when full access is obtained. In the event that
proposed construction extends north of the presently disturbed and investigated portions of the
ROW at site 41TT108 (a designated SAL), further evaluation of this strip should be undertaken to
determine whether it contributes to the overall significance of the site. Of the remaining sites, the
portions of sites 41BW761, 41BW766, 41BW767, 41BW768, 41DT272, 41DT273, 41DT274,
41DT275, and 41HS915 within the APE do not meet the criteria (36 CFR 60.4) for inclusion in
the NRHP or the criteria (13 TAC 26.8) for designation as SALs, and no further research is
warranted for the portion of these sites within the APE.

EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION OF STRATEGIES
In most cases, impact evaluations are conducted prior to a full archeological survey involving
shovel testing, mechanical trenching, or a combination of both. If observations made during the
evaluation effort reveal extensive natural and man-made disturbances that preclude the presence
of archeological historic properties or state archeological landmarks and thus obviate the
necessity for an intensive survey, the impact evaluation is often the only archeological field
assessment that many project areas undergo. Conversely, when survey is warranted, gathering
information based on impact evaluations expedites intensive survey planning through project
area-specific information, even when large tracts of new ROW necessitate mechanical trenching.
The location of utilities, the number and placement of trenches, soil and geological contexts, and
100

access restrictions—all information germane to the survey—can be predetermined with an impact
evaluation. For impact evaluations to be effective, however, researchers must have specific
project descriptions, scaled drawings, and right-of-entry to any new ROW, which, unfortunately,
is not the case in some project areas. However, for proposed project areas where access has been
denied, the impact evaluation can still be a valuable tool in determining whether or not an
intensive survey is warranted for that property through observations taken from adjacent areas.
An archeological survey usually follows an impact evaluation. Information from the impact
evaluation often results in intensive archeological survey of only short segments of a proposed
highway or road project where there is potential for, or existence of, archeological deposits or
sites rather than an intensive survey of the entire project APE. As with impact evaluations,
specific project descriptions and scaled drawings as well as right-of-entry are necessary,
particularly when conducting investigations in unassessed areas of proposed APEs outside of
preexisting ROWs. All shovel testing and trenching projects are conducted in accord with the
current Council of Texas Archeologists guidelines as approved by THC, and archeological sites
are normally found at this level of investigation. Sites can be assessed and recommendations
made for either no further work or for testing to determine NRHP eligibility and/or SAL
designation.
The survey efforts summarized in this report reinforce two aspects of archeological properties
within existing highway ROWs: (1) the previous disturbance related to road construction, utility
trenches, and maintenance often destroys the contextual integrity of site contexts; and (2) the
plotting of sites recorded long ago is often inaccurate. Of the portions of the 14 sites present with
the proposed APE of these road improvement projects, only five are considered to be potentially
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. The remaining nine sites either
lack contextual integrity due to the many impacts related to road construction or utility
placements, or because the portion of the site within the APE exhibits limited research potential.
The survey of 38.2 miles of ROW or 1,385.6 acres of APE, however, did reveal statistics that
appear to be the norm for northeast Texas. For example, one archeological site was found for
every 98.97 acres surveyed. One archeological site per 100 acres has been the presumed density
for large tract surveys in the area for years. Furthermore, the sites were found in only seven of
the 33 survey projects or in only 21.2 percent of the project areas. This figure is very close to the
23 percent figure that Peter calculated for 437 project areas examined under contracts 570 xx
PD002 (Wurtz et al. 2003), 570 xx PD003 (Peukert et al. 2003), 572 xx SA012 (Largent et al.
2005), 574 xx SA004 (Phillips et al. 2007), and 575 xx SA010 (Allday and Bastis 2008). The
limited impact area of many of the projects and the presence of many of the projects on low-order
streams contribute to this low percentage of project areas containing archeological sites.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Several recommendations can be made to promote a more consistent return of the necessary
information from the field. Some recommendations reiterate similar recommendations offered in
previous summary reports (i.e., Allday and Bastis 2008; Largent et al. 2005; Peukert et al. 2003;
Phillips et al. 2007; and Wurtz et al. 2003), but they bear repeating:
1. Gathering available map and archival information prior to fieldwork and a subsequent
recommendation is essential for a cost-effective approach. Many of the work
authorizations under this contract involved an APE with previously recorded sites that
101

needed to be revisited to determine their existence/condition/eligibility status. Thus,
literature and Sites Atlas research related to site locations is imperative for gathering
known data and identifying plotted locations of previously known sites. Six new historicera sites or major site components were recorded during the current contract. To
facilitate location and identification of potential historic-era sites and structures within
the ROW or APE during fieldwork, a review of The Texas Historic Overlay (Foster et al.
2006) and a review of both current and early editions of topographic, soils, and county
road maps prior to undertaking an impact evaluation or archeological survey remains
essential. Examination of historic aerial photographs of APEs (when available) prior to
survey efforts also helps focus the field investigations.
In instances where historic-era cultural remains are encountered, additional
resources/archives may also warrant careful examination. The continued reliance on
deed/title searches, however, is unwarranted. Deed/title searches only rarely provide the
level of detail that one is looking for to aid in the determination of eligibility for inclusion
in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Interviews with local informants/landowners
often provide more pertinent data.
2. Impact evaluations remain an essential tool for identifying areas for survey, trenching, or
both, as well as for clearing specific areas for additional construction projects. Only two
work authorizations under this contract were issued for impact evaluations solely. It is
our understanding that the impact evaluation can be a part of any survey effort; however,
we feel that there has been a change of focus to conducting intensive survey only. We
feel that the impact evaluation is a valuable first step in focusing intensive survey efforts
on those areas most likely to contain sites. We understand that interested parties may not
favor such an approach, but when investigations are finding sites in only 21 percent of the
project areas, it makes sense to focus survey efforts within a subset of the total project
areas.
3. Survey remains essential in locating sites within project areas. However, survey
conditions were less than ideal for the 2010 spring and early summer season within the
project areas. Heavy rains and significant surface water in northeast Texas precluded
survey within many portions of the projects or caused numerous trips to the project areas.
Geo-Marine personnel persevered in surveying areas when conditions were certainly less
than ideal in order to meet tight deadlines near the end of this contract as specified by
TxDOT personnel. In most cases, the short-term work periods were essential for TxDOT
to meet projected bidding and construction letting dates.
Clear and regular
communications should be maintained between investigators and TxDOT personnel
concerning the timeframe and full scope of what is required in order to conduct adequate
survey and meet TxDOT changes in required deadlines.
4. Experience with mechanical trenching during this contract revealed valuable lessons
concerning examination of trench walls and what can be interpreted concerning the
presence or absence of cultural material. In certain soil conditions, for example in a
fluvial setting or in homogeneous soils where stratigraphic layers may not be evident,
cultural materials of the same color as, or hard to identify in, the soil matrix may not
always be observable when troweling the trench walls. Subsequent excavation of shovel
tests in the same area sometimes reveals cultural deposits. Consequently, mechanical
trenching, in some environmental settings, is only suited for identifying living surfaces
102

and is often only informative concerning the presence or absence of cultural material if
accompanied by screening a sample of the removed soil matrix or the excavation of
additional units, larger than a shovel test, adjacent to the trench.

APPENDIX A
GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS

Adze: Tool whose cutting edge is at a right angle to the handle and that is used in working wood.
Area of potential effects (APE): ―Area of potential effects means the geographic area or areas
within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause changes in the character or use of
historic properties, if any such properties exist. The area of potential effects is influenced by the
scale and nature of an undertaking and may be different for different kinds of effects caused by
the undertaking‖ [36 CFR Part 800.16(d)]. Essentially, the area of potential effects (APE) is the
area of reasonably anticipated project impacts and is actually three-dimensional, consisting of
length, width, and depth.
Arrow point: Point used to tip an arrow, which is propelled by a bow.
Biface: Piece of conchoidally fracturing stone that has had flakes removed from both faces to
create a tool.
Dart point: Point used to tip a throwing spear or dart, which is propelled by an atlatl.
Debitage: Debris generated by the removal through percussion/pressure of flakes, chips, and
chunks to make stone tools.
Eligible for Inclusion in the National Register: ―The term eligible for inclusion in the National
Register includes both properties formally determined as such in accordance with regulations of
the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties that meet the National Register criteria‖ [36
CFR 800.16(l)(2)].
FCR (fire-cracked rock): Rock altered by extreme heat; used in rock-lined hearths or middens, as
a long-lasting heat-source, or as boiling stones dropped in liquids in skin or pottery containers.
Fill section: Introduced fill used to elevate the approaches to a bridge above the surrounding
terrain.
Flake: Generally thin piece of conchoidally fractured stone with a positive bulb of percussion
showing that it was removed from the parent piece by percussion/pressure.
Grog: Crushed fired clay added as temper to clay used in making ceramic vessels.
Historic property: ―Historic property means any prehistoric or historic district, site, building,
structure, or object included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic
Places maintained by the Secretary of the Interior. This term includes artifacts, records, and
remains that are related to and located within such properties. The term includes properties of
traditional religious and cultural importance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization
and that meet the National Register criteria‖ [36 CFR 800.16(l)(1)]. Essentially, a historic
property is a cultural resource included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of
Historic Places.
Impact Evaluation: Onsite inspection as the initial step in determining whether subsequent
survey of a particular area is warranted, given the anticipated impacts of the project, the existing
level of disturbance, and the likelihood of archeological deposits in good context for a proposed
Transportation Activity.
A-3

Megafauna: Particularly large animal such as bison and mammoth, usually associated with the
Pleistocene era and extinct by the beginning of the Holocene era.
Midden: Accumulation of occupational debris, particularly organic remains.
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Eligibility Criteria: The Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation has set forth the following regulations to define significance and to
determine eligibility of cultural resources:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [39 CFR
Part 60].

Post-review discovery survey: Survey consisting of a site visit to rapidly evaluate potential
historic properties discovered during construction
Projectile point: Inclusive term for arrow and dart points.
Scraper: Tool with generally thick, unifacially modified edges used to work hides, bone, and
wood.
Sherd: A piece of broken pottery.
State Archeological Landmark (SAL): The Texas Historical Commission ―uses one or more of
the following criteria when assessing the appropriateness of official landmark designation, and/or
the need for further investigations under the permit process:
(1) the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or
history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
(2) the site‘s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
(3) the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
(4) the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;
(5) the high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to insure [sic] maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected‖ [Texas Administrative Code (13
TAC Part 2.§26.8)]. Essentially, a state archeological landmark (SAL) is the state
equivalent of a historic property.
Survey: Fieldwork to locate archeological remains within the project area for a proposed
Transportation Activity, including on-foot examination of the surface, shovel testing, and
subsurface mechanical trenching (where appropriate) within the area of potential effects.
A-4

Temper: Nonplastic materials added to clay to decrease the risk of cracking when firing ceramic
vessels.
Transportation Activity:
Any proposed project involving the development, design,
construction, or maintenance of the state‘s intermodal transportation system.
