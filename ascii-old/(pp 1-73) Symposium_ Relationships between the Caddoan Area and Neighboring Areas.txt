RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE CADDOAN
AREA AND NEIGHBORING GROUPS

The Caddoan Area: An Introduction to

the Symposium
E. MOTT DAVIS

The Symposium
This paper and those which follow are based on presentations made
at a symposium on "Relationships Between the Caddoan Area and
Neighboring Areas" at the 23rd annual meeting of the Society for
American Archaeology at the University of Oklahoma on May 2,
1958. Robert E. Bell, Chairman of the Program Committee for that
meeting, suggested a session on Caddoan archeology in which the
papers would not be so specialized as to be incomprehensible to the
listeners, almost all of whom would not be specialists in Caddoan
archeology. The symposium was therefore set up with two factors
in mind: the relative ignorance of the audience, and the specialized
interests of the speakers. The general topic of "relationships with
neighboring areas" was chosen because it provided an opportunity to
present not only something about Caddoan archeology, but also about
its place in the culture history of the continent--a subject of interest
to all Americanists, whether Caddoan specialists or not. In addition,
the program was set up to include discussions for each paper, since
this practice, especially when disagreements are voiced, makes technical subjects stimulating for specialists and non-specialists alike. For
this reason also, the discussants were enjoined not simply to echo the
opinions of the main speaker. In addition, the symposium was begun
with a brief presentation of the current state of knowledge of Caddoan
archeology, in order to provide a frame of reference for those unacquainted with the area.
It is acknowledged with regret that one set of relationships, perhaps
the most fascinating of all, is not touched on here: the relationships
between the Caddoan area and Mexico. This is a subject which, to be
treated other than superficially, would alone require an entire symposium, or even several symposia.

Since the symposium took place, in 1958, the authors of the papers
and the discussants have had the opportunity to revise their oral presentations as they have seen fit. In a few cases the papers appear here
essentially as they were given at the symposium; those by Bell, Webb,
and Ielks are in this category. The rest of the papers have undergone
revision; some more, some less. The task of marshalling the written
papers has been carried out by T. N. Campbell, the editor of this
bulletin.
It should also be noted that the Fifth Conference on Caddoan
Archeology was held at the University of Oklahoma just before the
meeting of which this symposium was a part, and some of the matters
treated formally in the symposium had already been discussed informally, and at length, in the Conference. The Proceedings of the
Conference are published in this bulletin, following the present group
of symposium papers. There is .some duplication, but not a great deal.
The combination of symposium and conference provides a good view
of the present status of Caddoan archeology.

The Caddoan Area
Geographical Limits. The area in which Caddoan sites are important
is made up of the adjoining parts of the states of Oklahoma, Arkansas,
Louisiana, and Texas. The northern boundary is the Arkansas River,
with its immediate tributaries, and the eastern boundary is the
Ouachita and its immediate tributaries. On the south, the edge of the
area is about one hundred miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico, and
on the west the border can be drawn at the western edge of the "piney
woods" in Texas--roughly, the Trinity-Brazos divide--and northward
to the vicinity of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Some Caddoan components are
found outside these bounds, but in general they define what we usually
think of as "The Caddoan Area." It is a wooded, well-watered area
without significant natural barriers to movement, and well suited to
native agriculture. Archeologically it is part of the Southeastern area
of North America.
Archeological Characteristics. Caddoan sites are village sites, ceremonial centers with mounds, and burial grounds containing graves
with quantities of distinctive, well-made pottery of a wide variety of
types. On the pottery, which is not painted, engraving and excising o[
polished ware, often with paint rubbed into the engraved lines, is a
favorite form of decoration; and bottles and carinated bowls are (along
with jars) popular vessel forms. The interlocking scroll is a frequent
design motif. The usual tempering material is clay, but twenty to

thirty per cent of vessels are tempered with crushed bone--a trait
which sets Caddoan ceramics off from most others. No shell tempering
occurs until relatively late times in most of the Caddoan area. Pottery
pipe forms are distinctive. One very distinctive trait is a particular
house type in which the archeologist finds a large post mold underneath the central fireplace, signifying the use of a central post as a
temporary scaffold in the building of the structure.
Subdivisions: Aspects and Foci. Archeological nomenclature in the
Caddoan area follows the Midwestern Taxonomic System. The components fal! into two groups: Gibson Aspect or early Caddoan, and
Fulton Aspect or late Caddoan. Transitional sites are known, but most
components are clearly in one aspect or the other. Within the two
aspects a number of foal have been distinguished. They are listed here
alphabetically.

CADDOAN AREA

The components of the Fulton Aspect which contain European trade
material--those in the Alien and Glendora loci and others--are currently being re-examined with an eye to reclassification. This part of
the list will very likely soon be changed.
Gibson Aspect sites include ceremonial centers with platform
mounds containing large deep burial pits with multiple burials and
rich cult offerings, including (in some sites) Southern Cult materials.
Characteristic ceramic traits are very fine-line engraving, bottles with
long tapering spouts, and pipes with very long slender stems and
small bowls.
In the later Fulton Aspect, the whole impression is that of a less
sophisticated culture, except in a restricted area along the bend of the
Red River in southwestern Arkansas, where a number of Gibson
Aspect ceremonial traits survive. In general, Fulton Aspect mound
building is restricted to relatively small mounds and to mantles on
Gibson Aspect mounds. By historic times, mound building is no longer
practiced. Typical Fulton Aspect sites are extensive cemeteries of single
interments with a great deal of pottery, but usually no Southern Cult
objects. Characteristic ceramic traits are red slipped ware, brushed
utility pottery, relatively coarse engraved lines, wide-mouth vessels
with high flaring rims, spurred-line scrolls, the interlocking scroll
motif repeated four times around the vessel, cross-hatched engraving
as a background motif, and conical-bowl pipes.
Some Fulton Aspect sites contain European trade material, as already mentioned, and some of these historic remains have been identified with specific Caddo tribes of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as
Kadohadacho, Cahinnio, Hasinai, and Natchitoches.
Concentration on Ceremonial Sites. The fact that nothing has been
said about village sites, in this description of the two aspects, reflects
the fact that most archeological work in the Caddoan area has been
directed at mounds and cemeteries. Little information is available on
subsistence patterns, settlement patterns, or others of the everyday,
basic facets of Caddoan culture history. The fact that Caddoan culture
is synonymous with horticultural village life in this area is about all
we can say. The reasons for such phenomena as the appearance of
Caddoan traits in the area, certain shifts in the geographical range
of Caddoan materials with time, and the change from the Gibson
Aspect to the Fulton Aspect, are almost entirely unknown. Systematic
studies of prehistoric Caddoan socioeconomic patterns can rightfully
be said to be in their infancy.

Chronology. Concerning the matter of chronology in the Caddoan
area, there are important disagreements. Naturally the European
trade material, which first appears sometime between A.D. 1600 and
1750, provides an anchor at the near end of the sequence. In the prehistoric complexes the chronological evidence takes the form of stratigraphic relationships at a relatively few sites, strong cross-ties and
sequential ties in artifact types, a few radiocarbon dates, and correlations with the relatively well-established central Louisiana sequence
of Marksville-Troyville-Coles Creek-Plaquemine. It is in the critical
matter of the correlations with central Louisiana and the rest of the
Mississippi Valley that the disagreements occur. In simplified terms
there are two schools of thought on this matter:
(1) The first school is made up in the main of persons who have
done their work in the Caddoan area; the name of Alex D. Krieger is
most commonly associated with this viewpoint. According to this point
of view, the whole Caddoan archeological sequence covers a thousand
years or more, beginning around A.D. 700, or perhaps as early as A.D.
400 or 300. The Gibson Aspect is seen as beginning at about the same
time as, or earlier than, the Coles Creek period in the lower Mississippi
Valley.
(2) The second school of thought is made up mostly of persons who
have done their work in the Mississippi Valley, and is frequently
identified with the name of James A. Ford. In this view, the whole
Caddoan sequence is relatively brief, covering perhaps four centuries.
It begins around A.D. 1200 or 1300, at the end of the Coles Creek period
in the lower Mississippi Valley.
Both points of view have good evidence in their favor, as certain of
the papers which follow will make clear. The problem is important~
since it has a bearing on Caddoan origins. The cult material, platform
mounds, and many other items, which are commonly classed as
"Mississippian" and are found in early Caddoan sites as well as
farther east, derive their ultimate inspiration from Mesoamerica. If
Caddoan beginnings go back to A.D. 400, as adherents of the "Krieger"
school think possible, then the Caddoan area could have been the first
to have these Mesoamerican traits, which could have spread thence
eastward to the Mississippi Valley. By the "Ford" chronology, on the
other hand, the Caddoan area would necessarily have been the recip-lent of these traits from the Mississippi Valley cultures, rather than
having donated them to the latter.
Archaic Antecedents. A further aspect of the question of Caddoan

CADDOAN AREA

origins lies in the problem of the relationship of early Caddoan cultures to the Archaic cultures which preceded them in the same area.
Little is known on this subject, because until very recently our knowledge of the Archaic cultures was based almost entirely on studies of
surface collections (a major exception has been Baerreisâ work in
northeastern Oklahoma). However, despite the rudimentary state o[
knowledge, some relevant facts are known. Much of the Archaic stone
inventory continues with little alteration into the early Caddoan complexes, so that the impression of continuity from Archaic to Caddoan
is as strong as that of change. From this circumstance it might be
assumed that the appearance of Caddoan traits in the area was due
more to cultural diffusion than to population movement. Unfortunately
there have been few skeletal studies in the area, so that the question of
population changes remains to be answeredâ.
There are a number of complexes in the area which are postArchaic in the sense that they include pottery, but are pre-Caddoan
because they lack the distinctive Gaddoan style. The Bellevue Focus
in northwestern Louisiana and the upper Fourche Maline Focus of
eastern Oklahoma are examples of these âÂ°pre-Caddoan" ceramic complexes. In some degree these cultures appear to represent a transition
from the Archaic to the fully developed Caddoan cultures, but in
general their role in the development of the latter is not yet clear.
Tazonomic Position in Southeastern Archeology. For the sake of
formal taxonomists, it may be said that the Gibson Aspect and the
Fulton Aspect together make up a unit that, in the strict application
of the Midwestern Taxonomic System, would be called the Caddoan
Phase of the Mississippian Pattern. However, "Caddoan Phase" is not
a term currently in use; mainly because the term "phase" is in widespread use in American archeology in another sense--synonymously
with the Midwestern term "focus"--but also because the concept of
"phase" as employed in the Midwestern Taxonomic System has been
difficult to apply meaningfully in many areas, including this one.
It should further be pointed out that classifying "Gaddoan" as a
segment of something more general called "Mississippian," while a
convenient pedagogical device and not without some meaning in terms
of culture history, leaves much to be explained. "Gaddoan" applies to
the archeological evidences in a particular area, reflecting a particular
segment of culture history. "Mississippian" is a much more generalized concept, signifying certain resemblances, and hence relationships,
among most of the late prehistoric cultures of the Southeast. When an

10

TEXAS AIICIIEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

archeological complex is identified as Mississippian, it naturally remains to be determined how, when, and why it came to have the particular Mississippian characteristics. This is a job which has not yet
been accomplished for the Caddoan complexes. The chronological controversy already discussed points up some of the difficulties involved,
and the contributions to the symposium by Drs. Webb and Griffin and
their discussants elaborate the problem in some detail. Therefore,
when we classify "Caddoan" as part of "Mississippian," this categorization should be taken to signify only that Caddoan materials are primarily related to certain other complexes in the Southeast. The nature
of the relationship, in terms of historical events, is not yet fully understood.
Caddoan Archeology and Caddoan Linguistics. Finally, it should be
noted that the term "Caddoan" is used by both archeologists and linguists, but it has distinct meanings in the two fields. In both cases, it is
true, the term refers to phenomena related to the historic Caddo people.
Archeologically, however, the term applies to the cultures directly
ancestral to the Caddo, whereas linguistically it refers to a far-flung
group of related languages, one of which is that spoken by the Caddo.
The linguistic term is also often applied ethnologically to the historic
tribes who spoke Caddoan languages: not only the Caddo themselves
(who are thought to occupy the original homeland of the whole
group), but also the "Plains Caddoans"--the Wichita, Pawnee, and
Arikara, peoples of the Great Plains whose prehistoric ancestors in
that region did not share in the Caddoan archeological tradition we
have been discussing here. "Caddoan archeology" will doubtless eventually be tied in with the distinct prehistoric remains of the "Plains
Caddoans"; the paper by Dr. Bell in this symposium bears on this
matter. At present, however, the relationship of the Caddo proper to
the Wichita, Pawnee, Arikara, while well demonstrated linguistically,
has not been traced archeologically. "Caddoan archeology," then, applies to the study of the prehistory of only one member of the Caddoan
linguistic group, the Caddo proper.

Relationships Between the Caddoan and
Central Louisiana Culture Sequences1
CLARENCE H. WEBB

The major expressions of the central Louisiana culture sequence-Tchefuncte, Marksville, Troyville, Coles Creek, Plaquemine, Natchez
--lie generally south and east of the Caddoan area. Caddoan sites are
recognized down the Red River to central Louisiana; central Louisiana
occupations are found in northern Louisiana and into Arkansas, examples being the Kirkham site (Lemley and Dickinson, 1939) on
Little Missouri River, the Fredericks site (Ford, 1951 ) in Natchitoches
Parish, Lo~isiana, and the Crenshaw site (Lemley, 1936; Dickinson,
1936) in Miller County, Arkansas. The last two sites are in the Red
River valley.
Trade sherds and vessels have been found in both areas. From the
Gibson Aspect Davis site in eastern Texas (Newell and Krieger, 1949)
Krieger has identified sherds as Marksville Stamped, Marksville Incised, and Chevalier Stamped. Orr (1946, 1952) mentions Coles Creek
types at the Spiro Craig Mound site, arbitrarily equating these with
Spiro 1, but provenience and relationships with Caddoan materials at
this site have not been made available. Harrington (1920: P1. LXVIII,
B) illustrated a French Fork Incised vessel from the Washington site
(Haley Focus) and a cup (ibid.: Fig. 19) with Marksville Incised
decoration from Cedar Glades. From Sycamore Landing on the Ouachita River, Moore (1909: Figs. 104-118) illustrated stone pipes very
similar to Plaquemine pipes from Selsertown (near Natchez, Mississippi), also a vessel of type LâEau Noire Incised (engraved in this
instance), along with Caddoan pipes and vessels. In the late period,
vessels of Fatherland Incised were shown by Moore (1909) from Keno

Caddoan Area and Neighboring Areas," which was a part of the program of the
23rd Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, held at the University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, May 1-3, 1958. On the program this paper
was entitled "Relationships between the Caddoan Area and Louisiana."

and Glendora. Similar Natchezan vessels have been found with late
Caddoan wares at Camden on the Ouachita and at the Battle Mound
site on Red River (these were observed in the collections and from the
excavations of Frank Soday and M. P. Miroir respectively).
Conversely, Caddoan sherds have been found at a number of central
Louisiana sites. From the secondary mantle and surface wash of the
Crooks Mound, a Marksville site in La Salle Parish, Ford and Willey
(1940) have illustrated sherds now identifiable as Caddoan types
Belcher Ridged, Sinner Linear Punctuated, and Maddox Engraved
(Bossier Focus types), as well as Wilkinson Punctated and Harrison
Bayou Incised (Alto and Bossier Focus types). With these Caddoan
sherds were Plaquemine types Sanson Incised, Chevalier Stamped,
Anna Interior Engraved, sherds then called Catahoula Incised but now
assignable to Manchac Incised, and Plaquemine Brushed. Anna Interior Engraved occurs in Natchez in addition to Plaquemine, and
Chevalier Stamped begins in Troyville and extends through Coles
Creek into Plaquemine. The authors lumped all of these Caddoan,
Plaquemine, Coles Creek, and Natchez sherds as a late re-occupation,
discounting their appearance in the secondary mantle as a technical
field error, and stated that
after a period of desertion the structures were once more utilized by
Indians, apparently some time very close to 1700 A.D. This latter occupation seems to have been a brief one, and is indicated by potsherds of late
Caddoan, Natchez, and Tunican types mixed in the wash soil on the slopes
of Mound A.

A priori conclusions of this type, understandable in !940, are no
longer tenable. Two other statements from this report are significant.
(1) The authors stated that, with the error of identification of wash
material corrected, the fill of the secondary mantle ceased to show "appreciable" amounts of the late types. (2) They were at a loss to explain the presence of Sanson Incised and Catahoula Incised sherds in
pre-mound and burial platform levels, and again suggested that field
errors could be responsible. A few sherds of these types in Marksville
deposits should not be too surprising, particularly as a development
from Chinchuba Brushed and diagonal incising in Tchefuncte. I
found sherds of Harrison Bayou Incised, Coles Creek Incised, Manchac
Incised, and one sherd of Plaquemine Brushed in the deeper levels of
the Wiley Mound at Larto Lake, where the dominant sherd types were
Marksville and Troyville Stamped, Marksville Incised, and Churupa
Punctated.

GADDOAr,I AREA AI~qD CENTRAL LOUISIANA

From the Greenhouse site in central Louisiana Ford (i 951 ) reported
trade sherds that were identified by Krieger as Caddoan, including
Crockett Curvilinear Incised, probable Pennington Punctated-lncised,
and Holly Fine Engraved from Alto Focus ceramics, as well as possible
Haley and Texarkana Focus types. Furthermore, Hardy Incised, Wilkinson Punctated, and Harrison Bayou Incised (included in the type
Beldeau Incised, although punctations within the diamonds formed by
cross incising were lacking) are types present in Caddoan pottery of

the Alto and Bossier loci as well as in the central Louisiana ceramics.
The analyses show that these Caddoan sherds and shared types came
from Greenhouse levels assigned to both Troyville and Coles Creek
periods.
On the Plaquemine level, the Medora site (Quimby, i951) included
Hardy Incised and Harrison Bayou Incised as major Plaquemine
types. We have noted that these are also present in the Alto and Bossier foci (Hardy Incised is included by Krieger in type Kiam Incised).
Manchac Incised~ Plaguemine Brushed, Dupree Incised, and Lulu
Linear Punctated are indistinguishable, in my experience, from corresponding types in the Bossier Focus of northern Louisiana. The Bayou
Goula site (Quimby~ 1957) had these same types, as well as Rhinehardt Punctated, which is shared by Bossier Focus and has similarities
to Pennington type of Alto Focus. Therefore seven of the 16 Plaquemine decorated pottery types are generally indistinguishable from
Bossier Focus Caddoan types. Some of these have earlier beginnings in
Coles Greek and Alto in the two areas. One should note that these are
utility wares, tending to be much longer lived than ceremonial or
burial wares.
The Gordon site reported by Cotter (1952), origina!ly the type site
for Coles Creek, reveals Caddoan sherds in the state of Mississippi.
This site goes through the transition from Coles Greek to Plaquemine,
with the Coles Creek early enough to have Marksville and Troyville
Starnped~ Yokena Incised, and Mulberry Creek Cordmarked sherds,
and the Plaquemine lasting long enough to include a few Natchezan
criteria. Hardy Incised was the dominant type and Coles Creek Incised, Manchac Incised, and Rhinehardt Punctated were secondary
types in the early levels, with progressive replacement of Hardy Incised by Plaquemine Brushed in the later periods. Maddo_z" Incised
(Engraved), which reached this area from the Bossier Focus, was well
represented at all levels. Crockett Curvilinear Incised sherds and carl
hated bowl shapes were other Caddoan pottery features. Harrison
Bayou Incised type was present~ and unidentified sherds had engrav-

ing with spurs or triangles, suggestive of Haley Engraved. Circular
houses in the early period were succeeded by rectangular structures,
and the analogy to Davis (Alto Focus) houses was suggested by the
author. Rectangular structures with post holes in trenches, interrupted
at the corners, are very similar to the Haley Focus pre-mound structure at the Belcher Mound site (Webb, 1959). Projectile points included several Archaic types, the "fir-tree" variety of Alba or Scallorn, one Alba type (called Hayes), and the "fish-tail" or "sword-fish"
type found regularly at Plaquemine sites in Louisiana. "Fish-tail"
proiectile points in one of the Gahagan burial pits are more understandable when we note that they were found in the pre-mound Coles
Creek level at the Gordon site.
Cotter (1952) links the Gordon, Medora, Davis, and Greenhouse
sites as manifesting the primary features of Temple Mound I. He suggests that the progression from Troyville to Plaquemine appears to be
of no long duration, with Coles Creek pottery types common to both,
and that the interposition of Coles Creek as a cultural period is unnecessary. He thinks that the Gordon site provides the needed transition between Temple Mound I and Temple Mound II; at the culmination of Temple Mound II Plaquemine gave way to characteristic
Natchezan. He suggests a similar transition in the Gibson Aspect at
Alto, progressing from lingering Marksville and Copena traces toward
true Temple Mound characteristics.
At the historic level Quimby (1942), in his summary of the Natchezan culture, illustrates from Angola the types Wilkinson Incised,
which is a shell-tempered curvilinear incised Glendora Focus type,
and Hodges Engraved, a clay-tempered Belcher and Glendora Caddoan

type.
It may seem surprising that, despite these and many other evidences
of trade and contact between Caddoan and central Louisiana cultures,
there is serious disagreement concerning relationships and chronology.
Ford (1951) and Sears (1958) have compressed the entire Caddoan
sequence into the Plaquemine-Natchez time span, without elimination or compression of the Troyville or Coles Creek periods such as
Cotter suggests. Krieger (Newell and Krieger, 1949) finds convincing
reasons to equate Gibson Aspect inception with Marksville, and is supported by maize typology at the Davis site and C-14 datings. Since the
Plaquemine beginning date is estimated at i.D. 1300 to 1500 by Quireby (1957) and the Marksville-Troyville C-14 datings cluster around
A.D. 500 to 800, the variance of opinion is of serious proportions.
Time does not permit discussion of the many factors which remove

CADDOAN AREA AND CENTRAL LOUISIANA

15

these differences of opinion from the area of intransigence or the maintenance of preconceived ideas. As examples of these factors, one could
cite the conceptual differences expressed by Cotter and Quimby concerning the Plaquemine period, the sweeping movements of ceramic
traits recounted by Ford, differences in typing methods in the two
areas, the long life span of certain pottery and other artifact types, and
spatial as contrasted with temporal variations in ceramic techniques.
I have attempted to clarify Caddoan-central Louisiana interchanges
by a study of surface sherd collections and ten site excavations in the
chief contact zone across northern Louisiana. Our surface collections
include over a hundred sites, but I have particularly studied the 20
larger collections, each of which yields between 100 and 1200 decorated sherds.
The Tchefuncte culture has not been found in northern Louisiana
or the entire Caddoan area. It can be eliminated from direct comparison, but one notes that the linear punctated Tchefuncte type Lake
Borgne Incised looks like a good ancestor for the Bossier Focus type
Sinner Linear Punctated. Our recent finding of Sinner Linear Punctated vessels with Haley and Alto Focus types in Mineral Springs
Mound burials, and the presence of linear punctated sherds at the
Troyville, Crooks, and Wiley sites narrows the gap between these
types.
On the Marksville level, the Fredericks site in Natchitoches Parish
has been termed Marksville or Troyville by Ford (1951). Our sherd
collection includes zoned dentate and rocker stamping which may be
interpreted as both Marksville and Troyville Stamped, as well as
Marksville Incised, Churupa Punctated, Mulberry Creek Cordrnarked,
Mazique and Chase Incised, and plain with notched rims. No Caddoan sherds have been found on this site. Other sites in northwestern
Louisiana on this time level are included in the Bellevue Focus, of
which four mound sites have been excavated. Significant traits are
flexed burials, cremation, primary platforms in small conical mounds,
late Archaic lithic artifacts, and small beads of stone and rolled copper. The preponderantly plain pottery is clay-, sherd-, or bone-tempered. The few decorated sherds are unidentified incised, plain sherds
with transverse or oblique lip incisions, Marksville Stamped, and Churupa Punctated. The Bellevue sites belong to a single culture period,
no Caddoan or Coles Creek pottery types or small projectile points
having been found.
All other pottery-yielding sites in northwestern Louisiana, from
which we have collections, have Caddoan sherds, mainly of Bossier

16

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Focus types (Webb, 1948). Tabulation of some 35 pottery types from
the 20 sites (five mound and 15 village sites), and grouping the sites
in accordance with the combined frequencies of six major Bossier
pottery types which would not be confused with Coles Creek or Alto
types~iaddox Engraved, Belcher Ridged, Sinner Linear Punctated,
Pease Brushed-Incised, Bossier Brushed, and Karnack Brushed-shows three distinct groupings:
(1) Group 1, comprising two mound and six village sites, shows the
combined Bossier types to total 12.4 to 27.6% of the decorated sherds.
Alto Focus wares, judged by the distinctive types Holly and Hickory
Engraved, Weches, Crockett, Pennington, and Davis, are well represented, with combined frequencies of 6.7 to 14% from six sites, 1.6%
at one, and 26% at another. Only a few distinctive Haley Focus sherds
are found.
Six of these eight sites have distinctive Coles Creek sherds, judged
by the types French Fork Incised, Chase Incised, Chevalier Stamped,
Beldeau Incised, and Coles Creek Incised (with subjacent triangles or
incisions along a flat lip), in combined frequencies of 2 to 8% of dec-orated sherds from four sites, less than 1% in the other two. Moreover,
two of these sites have one to two sherds of Churupa Punctated or
Maziquo~ Incised, and one site lacking Cole Creek sherds has three
sherds of Marksville or Troyville Stamped.
(2) Group 2, represented by one mound and six village sites, had 39
to 59% of the decorated sherds represented in the combined Bossier
Focus types. One would assume that these well-developed Bossier sites
are later than Group 1, and this is borne out by the fact that the listed
Alto types total less than 1 ~o from five of the seven sites. One site
has 4% Alto, chiefly Davis Incised. It also (the only instance in Group
2) has Coles Creek sherds, totaling 4% among the listed types, and
one sherd of Marksville Stamped. A second site of Group 2, lacking
Coles Creek types, has three sherds (out of 1948) of Marksville
Stamped. These Group 2 sites have Plaquemine types like Evangeline
Interior Incised and Dupree Incised, whereas Evangeline was lacking
and Dupree rare in Group 1. The broad line incising of Sanson Incised
increases in frequency to as high as 5 % in two of the Group 2 sites.
Sherds with curvilinear incising of grouped lines increase in frequency
to 1 to 4%, compared to less than 1% in all but one site of Group 1.
(3) Group 3 consists of three mound and two village sites in which
the stated Bossier types increase to 70-79% of decorated sherds. Four
of these five sites have no Coles Creek, Marksville, or Troyville types;

CADDOAI~ AREA AND CENTRAL LOUISIANA

17

two of these four have no Alto or Haley, the other two having i % or
less. The fifth site has three sherds of Crockett Curvilinear, one each
of Coles Creek Incised and TroyvilIe Stamped. Dupree and curvilinear
incising continue, there is a considerable increase in brushing, red
filming increases, occasional sherds of shell-tempered or porous light
wares occur, as well as Belcher Engraved and Cowhide Stamped types.
These facts indicate that Group 3 is approaching Belcher Focus times.
The rarity of shell tempering shows that none of the 20 sites are
late Caddoan. From the 20 sites more than 12,000 sherds were examined. Only 55 sherds from six sites are shell tempered, and 42 of
these are from a recognized Glendora Focus component at Smithport
Landing. This leaves 13 shell-tempered sherds among the 11,000
(0.1%) from the other 19 sites. All Group 1 sites except Smithport and
four of the Group 2 sites are totally lacking in shell temper. By comparison, shell tempering totals 3% in Belcher Focus levels at the Belcher site and 50% or more in Glendora Focus sites at Natchitoches and
near Shreveport.
I omitted from the distinctive Bossier, Alto, and Coles Creek sherd
tabulations the types Hardy, Harrison Bayou, Dunkin and Manchac
Incised, Wilkinson and Rinehardt Punctated, because I have found
it impossible to allocate these utility types specifically to Coles Creek,
Plaquemine, Alto, or Bossier ceramics--they generally occur in all.
Hardy Incised shows levels of 14 to 30% in Group 1, dropping to
levels below 10% in Group 2 and below 5 % in Group 3, except in two
sites of Group 2, one of which maintains 4% Coles Creek Incised.
Sherds of Dunkin and Manchac Incised types are generally not separable; they diminish markedly in Group 3. Wilkinson Punctated is
at levels from 5 to 15 % in Group 1, decreasing in most of Group 2 and
Group 3, but is still present from all but one Group 3 site. Sherds of
Rhinehardt Punctated, random punctated, Pennington Punctated Incised and Dupree Incised are often difficult to separate, except when
Pennington appears on the typical bowl form in those Group 1 sites
where Alto is well represented. Punctations were made with pointed,
rounded, fiat-tipped, and circular tools; crescentic, comma-shaped, rectangular, circular, triangular, and nail punctations occur, free or in
zones, alternating with incised areas or plain areas. All punctations
are more frequent in Group 1, progressively declining thereafter;
triangular punctations and typical Pennington are infrequent or absent from Group 2 and Group 3 sites. Although zoned punctations
continue, punctations in single rows between horizontal lines are found
only where Coles Creek and Alto types are present.

In summary, these site studies give evidence that Bossier Focus
ceramics developed in northern Louisiana out of Coles Greek and Alto;
there was close parallelism between the appearance of Coles Greek
and Alto ceramic types in this area in Group 1 sites and their progressive diminution and disappearance in Groups 2 and 3 as Bossier
Focus developed fully. Contemporaneity of Plaquemine and Bossier is
indicated by trade sherds and shared types in Group 2 sites. These
studies and other evidences indicate that Bossier Focus lasted for a
rather long time, was manifested from the Ouachita River in the
Camden area completely across northwestern Louisiana to dip into
eastern Texas, and was at least partially contemporaneous with Haley
Focus, judging by the shared types Maddox Engraved, Sinner Linear
Punctated, and Pease Brushed-Incised (which we found with Haley
ceramics in Mineral Springs Mound burials, Howard County, Arkansas). The intrusion of Belcher Focus down the Red River into northern
Louisiana probably occurred at or near the end of Bossier times.
Excavations at the Mounds Plantation in Caddo Parish, Louisiana,
give an opportunity to check the contemporaneity of Coles Creek and
Alto, which is indicated above in the surface collections. The Sanson
site on Catahoula Lake offers a similar check on Plaquemine and Bossier. At the Mounds Plantation, a large temple-mound-with-plaza site,
a refuse deposit exposed along the sides of a drained borrow pit, therefore presumably pre-mound, yielded over 400 sherds, 33% of which
are bone tempered, all others clay tempered. Many of the bone-tempered sherds are from large, thick-walled plain vessels; 14 sherds are
black polished plain. Decorated types include Coles Creek Incised, triangular punctated, Hardy Incised, Davis Incised, black polished engraved of uncertain type, Wilkinson Punctated, and Sanson Incised.
During 1957 Mound B at this site was trenched by a friend who allowed me to study the sherds removed by approximately one-foot
levels. From the pre-mound level there are Hardy, Coles Creek, and
Davis Incised (one bone tempered), thin burnished, and thick plain
sherds. The mound fill to the six-foot level contained the same types,
as well as Pennington and Hickory. Davis Incised is particularly frequent, as it is in all collections from this site, totaling 22% of the
decorated wares. An occupation level at six feet above the base yielded
many sherds of Holly Engraved, also Hickory, Davis, Crockett, Wilkinson, Hardy, Chase, and Coles Creek Incised (including subjacent
triangles, triangles between incised lines, rim thickening, and lip incising). At the eight-foot level there were Hardy, Davis, Hickory,
Pennington, and Wilkinson types, and these continued to the surface.

GADDOAN AREA AND GENTBAL LOUISIANA

From the surface and mound wash, these same Alto and Coles Creek
types were found, also Harrison Bayou~ Beldeau~ and triangular, circular, and crescentic punctated sherds. An intrusive burial into the
mound had Maddox Engraved and Belcher Ridged pottery, presumably
a later Bossier burial.
The Sanson site on Catahoula Lake, central Louisiana, has evidence along the beach of occupation from Archaic through Plaquemine times. Excavation of a mound by a local resident during the early
1930âs produced many whole vessels and sherds, the vessels associated
with evidences of cremation, along with stone beads, polished stone
artifacts, stone and pottery pipes, and a cache of small projectile points
with pointed stems similar to Bassett and Perdiz types of the Fulton
period. Pottery sherds included Coles Greek~ Plaquemine, and Bossier
types, also Cowhide Stamped sherds which could pertain to Belcher
or Bossier wares. Whole vessels are assignable to Plaquemine and Bossier types, including a number of the type Maddox Engraved (one
incised). The trait of "killing" the vessel was present, some in the
process of manufacture, others by punching a hole in the base after
firing. This site offers convincing evidence of contemporaneity of
Plaquemine and Fulton periods.
A word should be added about the "Pre-Caddoan" burials at the
Crenshaw site, with vessels identified by Ford (1951) as Coles Creek
Plain, Coles Creek Incised, Greenhouse Incised, French Fork Incised,
and Rhinehardt Punctated. Ford (1951) and Dickinson (1936) both
mentioned differences in vessel shape, paste characteristics, and surface
finish from Coles Greek vessels of central Louisiana. Ford attributed
this to temporal lateness in the Coles Greek period, but I submit that
these are characteristics seen often in Gibson Aspect Caddoan ceramics,
especially the insertion of pigment into the decoration lines and red
filming over the entire surface (traits never found in central Louisiana Coles Greek). Other Gibson characteristics of these burials are
the orderly placement of many extended burials in large pits, flooring
of the burial pits with multicolored sands, generous burial offerings,
caches of small projectile points (of a type similar to Hayes), longstemmed pipes, and turtle carapace rattles. This adds up to modified
Coles Greek pottery in typical Gibson Aspect burials, evidence which
is more suggestive of contemporaneity than of Coles Greek antecedence.
In conclusion, I would agree with Cotterâs thesis of close parallelism
between central Louisiana and Caddoan cultural development after
Marksville times~ except that I would prefer elimination of the Troy-

20

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

ville concept, which we cannot identify in the Caddoan area, whereas
we can readily identify Marksville, Coles Creek, Plaquemine, and
Natchez ceramics. The same sweeping changes are seen at the end of
Marksville times in both areas--temple mounds, plaza arrangement,
large circular houses shifting to squared, introduction of small arrow
projectile points, scroll motifs, polished vessel surfaces, and many
others, also closely paralleled by early Mississippian developments.
With clarification of the terminal Marksville-Troyville-Coles Creek
confusion, one should be quite comfortable in equating Coles Creek
with Gibson Aspect Caddoan; Plaquemine with Bossier, Belcher or
other protohistoric Fulton Aspect Caddoan; Natchez with Glendora
Focus contact period Caddoan. This is true whether one judges by general cultural context, by closely related or shared traits, or by actual
trade items.
Addendum. Since completion of this paper, a report has been received from the Humble Oil and Refining Company Research Laboratory, Houston, Texas, of two radiocarbon assays from the Belcher
Mound site, Caddo Parish, Louisiana, which bear on this discussion.
(1) Run No. 320, charcoal from charred timber, House 4, pre-mound
level beneath Mound B, on a Haley-Alto Gibson Aspect level, yielded
a date of 1100 -- 100 years before the present. (2) Run No. 322, charcoal from charred timber, House 7, Primary Mound A, on a Belcher
Focus, Fulton Aspect level, yielded a date of 200 -+- 100 years before
the present. If these dates hold up, this gives a time span of 900 years
or more at this site, with Bossier Focus occupation intervening between
the dated levels, and places the Gibson occupation at a time shortly
after most Marksville-Troyville C- 14 dates.

Discussion
By Alex D. Krieger
Webb has analyzed the relationships between the Caddoan cultural
block and the lower Mississippi Valley with great skill and insight.
His general correlation of Gibson Aspect with Coles Creek, and Fulton
Aspect with Plaquemine, plus the importance of Bossier Focus and

22

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

his qualifications about Troyville, seem to me to be as satisfactory as
is possible in present knowledge; I can do little more than emphasize
some of the points he makes.
Fordâs contention that both the Gibson and the Fulton aspects can
be correlated with Plaquemine can be refuted in many ways, as Webb
has shown; see also my review of Fordâs Greenhouse Site publication
in American Antiquity (Vol. 18, 1952:175-179). It is possible, moreover, that these divergent views might be more or less reconciled if
more emphasis (and future research) were placed on one point mentioned by Webb, namely, that utility wares and "ceremonial or
burial wares" (which I prefer to call "fine wares") present different
chronological problems. As is wel! known, these two general categories are apparent through vast areas in South America, Middle
America, and the Southwest; and wherever chronology has become
well controlled it is also apparent that the coarse or utiltiy wares
underwent stylistic changes much more slowly than the "fine" wares.
Caddoan ceramics likewise reveal this duality, perhaps more so than
any cultures in the United States outside the Southwest. In this case,
however, chronological control over the respective rates of change in
these wares is still crude, but is progressing.
Comparisons between Caddoan and lower Mississippi Valley ceramics now appear to make this matter somewhat clearer, through
Webbâs research as well as, formerly, my own. First, it now seems
rather clear that when a few pottery types are somewhat similar in
Gibson and/or Fulton Aspect loci, and Plaquemine, or still present
knotty problems in type inclusiveness and specific association with
cultural units, these types are in the utility category as Webb has
shown. Second, it seems clear that the identification of specific and
distinctive types of "fine" pottery of the Gibson Aspect, such as Holly
Fine Engraved, in a Plaquemine assemblage, is quite erroneous; a few
years ago Webb pointed out to me how far off these "identifications"
are. The position of Louisiana archeologists that all Caddoan material
belonged at the top of the Louisiana chronological column was understandable as long as no chronological depth had been claimed or demonstrated in Caddoan archeology; but I think the time is long past for
this position to be defensible.
At present it seems more important that we work on the problem of
whether the Gibson Aspect--or more specifically, the Alto Focus-was contemporaneous with all or part of the Coles Creek period, or
with both Troyville and some part of Coles Creek. The identification
of a Troyville complex or period outside of a small area in central

CADDOAIâq AREA At~/D CENTRAL LOUISIAI~A

23

Louisiana has long been a puzzle to everyone concerned. Coles Creek,
on the other hand, spread over a considerable area in central and
northern Louisiana, reaching into southern Arkansas and slightly into
northeastern Texas; trade vessels from it are found as far north as
the Spiro site in Oklahoma.
There are now some 16 radiocarbon dates which Ford has assigned
to Troyville and Coles Creek. They form two distinct groups, that for
Troyville ranging from about A.D. 500 to 1100, and that for Coles Creek
from about A.D. 800 to 1250. It is not surprising that the two series
overlap, for no one has claimed that the change from Troyville to
Coles Creek was abrupt or easy to trace.
In his paper Webb states that he favors elimination of the Troyville
concept, presumably because it has such a small distribution when
compared with Coles Creek. Others have also suggested this, but I donât
know what should be done with it. The term Troyville marks the first
appearance of temple mounds in Louisiana, but it might be feasible
to regard the whole sequence of dates from about A.D. 500 to 1250 as
"Coles Creek," then divide this into "early" and "late" phases~ with
the "early" phase marking the introduction of temple mounds. I would
rather leave this to the people who are working in that area now.
There is but a single radiocarbon date for the Alto Focus at the Davis
site~ 1553---175 years, obtained in 1951, which would be roughly
A.D. 400 ----- 175. Considering the margin of error, this date may not be
very different from the earliest one assigned to Troyville at about
A.D. 500. Even if not completely accurate, it is hard to see how the
actual date could be as late as the block of A.D. 800 to 1250 assigned by
Ford to Coles Creek. I would rather think that an approximate date of
A.D. 500 would apply to the introduction of temple mounds both at
Troyville and at the Davis site. Here we seem to be "stuck" at present.
As for the identification of Marksville and Troyville sherds found
in Texas, I showed the Davis site sherds to several people, among them
Quimby~ Griffin, and MacNeish. Ford was then working in South
America. The aforementioned persons all agreed that some of the
Davis sherds were good examples of Marksville Stamped and Marksville Incised, and another as Chevalier Stamped of the Troyville period.
Griffin also identified two sherds as Montgomery Incised of the Adena
culture. These were all reported as such in the Davis site monograph.
Later, MacNeish identified another rocker-stamped sherd as inseparable from Hopewellian pottery in Illinois and IÂ¥isconsin (see my
review of the Greenhouse publication mentioned above, Fig. 79).
There was no indication of a pre-Alto Focus occupation of the site, so

TEXAS AI~CHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

far as I could tell from Newellâs field notes, which were extremely
painstaking.
We should also remember the common occurrence of Copena
"points" or knives in the Alto, Gahagan, and other Gibson Aspect loci,
the large rectangular graves with rows of parallel skeletons and piles
of offerings in the grave corners, a trait shared only with Hopewell
and the Miraflores complex in Guatemala, and many other interesting
traits which were pointed out in the Davis site monograph and which
are all persistently ignored by those who would have the Alto Focus
begin as late as A.D. 900 or even 1400.
I no longer think that the Alto Focus could have appeared during
Marksville time, but I do think it began soon afterward with the appearance and spread of the temple-mound idea in the Southeast, and
that there were numerous trait survivals from the Hopewell-Marksville period into this early temple-mound horizon. There must have
been some individuals in early Troyville communities who were still
making Marksville pottery, and so on. I prefer to see archeological
situations as fluid rather than "layer-cakes" in which cultures suddenly end and others just as suddenly begin. In the Southeast there are
far too many preconceptions as to how things should be, even to the
point of rejecting all radiocarbon dates which donât suit the preconceptions. This is interesting in itself, because in most parts of the world
the datings have caused a lot of reconsiderations and revisions in
previous thinking.
I have many times said that the Caddoan-lower Mississippi Valley
cultural situation is comparable to the Southwest in area, time depthÂ°
and complexity of interrelationships; but whereas in the Southwest
scores or even hundreds of able students have worked for many years
on its problems, only six or eight have done intensive research in Caddoan archeology. Obviously, much is yet to be learned about it.

This disagreement in cross-dating of the Caddo area boils down to
whether it was an explosive affair of four centuries or a leisurely one
of 12 centuries. The hard remarks about the Midwestern system have
been against those who try to use it to derive information. For the
central Louisiana materials Willey once suggested the term Gulf
Tradition. The argument presented by Webb is based on burial units.
In the Mississippi Valley we have used refuse statistics, so that the

CADDOAN AREA AND CENTRAL LOUISIANA

25

periods are cut from a continuum and are not discrete units as in the
Caddoan Area.
Louisiana and Florida share the meander, negative excising and
later a reversal of this, quadration, and other traits derived from Hopewell and later Mississippi. The Caddoan Area is distinguished by
engraving with pigment and bottle forms, and these are derived from
Mexico. Most of the arguments about contemporaneity are based on
the occurrence of traits shared between Louisiana and Texas. The
problem is whether they came from the Mississippi or the other way.
No carinated bowls are found in Marksville or Troyville; they enter
in late Coles Creek. In the Plaquemine period these Mexican traits
move into the Mississippi area, going up to St. Louis and across to
Alabama and Georgia, becoming part of the Mississippi pattern. This
is a different situation from that of the cult materials, which go all
over the eastern United States. We are arguing matters discussed ten
years ago and we need new information.

Relationships Between the Caddoan Area
and the Mississippi Valley1
dAMES B. GRIFFIN

Some years ago I published "An Interpretation of the Place of Spiro
in Southeastern Archaeology" (Griffin, 1952), which clearly aligned
the ceremonial efflorescence at the Spiro site with the developed Southern Cult. It was clear to me then that Spiro must be regarded as essentially contemporaneous with many cultural elements moving from
the Mississippi Valley to eastern Oklahoma. In that paper I belabored
certain views of Caddoan development which Krieger favored at the
time. Subsequently, I have found that while some archeologists dealing
with the Mississippi Valley have been able to read, and understand,
this paper (Williams and Goggin, 1956), that the Caddoan area students, by and large, have either not read it, or were so disenchanted
with the point of view that they do not even attempt to refute it.
In my preparation for this current Caddoan session I have been
stimulated by Bel!âs (1953) short paper summarizing certain grave
groups from the Craig Mound and Baerreisâ (1957) paper presenting
his views on the relationship between "The Southern Cult and the
Spiro Ceremonial Complex." In this paper Baerreis proposed an admirable method of attack to a developmental sequence within the
Caddoan area and a comparison of Caddoan culture and its ceremonies
with that of the area to the east. His interpretation, however, that there
is a Spiro Ceremonial Complex in eastern Oklahoma which precedes
and is antecedent to the Southern Cult, representing a time level at
which possible Hopewe11 influences are to be sought, is unsound and
unsatisfactory.
It is somewhat difficult to assess adequately the exact temporal position of the burial groups described by Bell, but they are certainly sonaewhere within the Spiro Focus as the term is used by Baerreis.
This paper was presented at a symposium entitled "Relationships between the
Caddoan Area and Neighboring Areas," which was a part of the program of the
23rd Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, held at the University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, May 1-3, 1958.

Burial 7 was a large multiple grave containing about 20 individuals.
It had 8 pottery vessels, 114 flint projectile points and a few other artifacts. There were two bottle forms, one engraved and the other incised.
Vessel B7-8 is a low bowl with incurved rim and lug handles which is
shell tempered. One of the jars has a fiat-bottomed squared base. As a
group the vessels are good Spiro forms.
Burial 9 was a multiple burial containing several skeletons. As grave
offerings there were 9 pottery bowls, and Bell included drawings of
three of them. B9-4 is a red filmed, almost certainly shell-tempered
bowl with a small effigy head projecting" upward and slightly inward
from the upper rim. B9-16 is also an ovoid effigy bowl. Vessels B9-1912-5 and 22 are also red-filmed ovoid bowls, and a hasty examination
before the meeting leads me to believe they are also shell tempered.
The following listing, from Bell, of other grave goods is important because they are primarily items of Baerreisâ Spiro Ceremonial Cult.
There were 2 pottery pipes, 3 stone ear spools, 1 stone disc, 6 polished
flint flared celts, 2 large polished stone spuds, 1 copper needle or bodkin, and a few other items.
Burial 51 was a secondary burial containing 11 skeletons. There
were six associated pottery vessels, three of which are Spiro Fine Engraved and have the contracting bottle neck ascribed to Gibson Aspect
forms. One of the vessels, B51-11, is a shell-tempered, strap-handled
BartorL Incised jar. Other artifacts include: 24 stone ear spools; 8
wooden ear spools; 13 stone discs; 1 copper disc; 1 stone bead; a wide
variety of shell beads; pearl beads; basketry; pieces of wood and
galena; and a few other items.
Burial 99 was a secondary burial of at least one individual. The
grave offerings contained 3 of the major stone effigy pipes, 4 other stone
pipes and a pottery pipe, 2 stone ear spools, and 475 flint projectile
points. A very significant additional trait was a shell-tempered hooded
effigy bottle of clear Middle Mississippi inspiration and origin.
Burial 162, a large secondary burial of 4 individuals, had 10 pottery
vessels. Vessel 162-19, not illustrated by Bell, is a shell-tempered tripod
on a stand. This vessel had strap handles, as did a flat-bottomed jar
with two rows of nodes. Among the other artifacts were 2 engraved
shells, 14 projectile points, 2 clay pipes, i stone ear spool, 1 copper
bodkin, and a few other items.
It has now been established that with a significant number of burials
within the Craig Mound there are pottery vessels which are clearly of
Middle Mississippi origin, either by trade or by some other means. It
would be interesting to learn some day what proportion of vessels and

CADDOAH AREA AHD THE ~IISSISSIPPI VALLEY

29

sherds from the Craig Mound are shell tempered. The hooded effigy
bottle is of a type most common in southeast Missouri and western
Kentucky, while the shell-tempered incised rim jar most closely resembles Barton Incised, which is a type that is very common in northeast Arkansas.
A great many of the projectile points from the Craig Mound are the
small triangular side-notched forms, sometimes also with a basal notch.
These are much more common at Craig than at many other Caddoan
sites. They do not, I think, originate in the Cactdoan area but are connected to similar forms from the Ohio Valley and to the southwest.
In Baerreisâ paper the view is expressed that perhaps there is a Spiro
Ceremonial Complex which may have antedated the Southern Cult
but that some of the following list of traits may have lasted up into the
period of the Southern Cult. These Spiro Ceremonial Complex traits
are ear spools of stone and wood, T-shaped pipes of stone and clay,
human and animal effigy pipes, equal-armed pipes, elongate celts,
caches of delicately manufactured projectile points, copper rods. and
chipped stone blades. The article states that
Â¯ . . these elements crystallized to form a local ceremonial complex which
antedated the Southern Cult. Later, some of the elements combined with
Mexican traits to form the characteristic Southern Cult. Thus, for eastern
Oklahoma the Spiro Ceremonial Complex is the direct antecedent of the
Southern Cult and represents the time level at which possible Hopewell
influences are to be sought (Baerreis, 1.957: 37).
Before commenting on this point of view expressed by Baerreis some
observations from additional sites will be presented. The Norman site
is one usually placed in the earlier part of the Caddoan continuum,
and it is equated approximately in time with the Craig Mound. Indeed, a number of the stone ear spool forms at Craig and Norman are
said to be very similar and may be regarded as essentially contemporary. At the Norman site I noticed in Finkelsteinâs report (!940) mention of 2 copper-plated stone ear spools associated with 2 large clay
discs, cane matting, 3 double-stemmed shell-tempered clay pipes, 1
double-stemmed pipe of stone, a human effigy stone pipe, and a shelltempered bottle. One of the copper effigy plates at Norman was associated with a shell-tempered jar. A second copper plate was associated
with copper-plated stone ear spools, a shell-tempered bottle and a
shell-tempered jar. Additional artifact traits from Norman include a
small hooded human shel!-tempered bottle, a ring-base bottle with a
globular body, shell-tempered elbow pipes, and strap handles on jars.
The Brackett site, which had a small number of stone ear spools

30

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

(all of Baerreisâ Type A), has a ceramic complex which also clearly
equates it with Craig and other suggested "early" Caddoan sites. These
include Spiro Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Crockett Curvilinear
Incised, a French Fork bowl, and a strap-handled Spiro Engraved jar
(Bareis, 1955). There is also a human male effigy vessel which Robert
Bell informed me he thinks is shell tempered. There is a large amount
of shell-tempered pottery at this site which is called Woodward Plain
in the Caddo country. There were two clay elbow pipes, and one of
these is shell tempered.
At the Nagle site near Oklahoma City (Shaeffer, 1957), there were
two stone ear spools of Type A, one with a multiple cross and the other
with the six-pointed star design. Some of the projectile points are similar to the Cahokia side-notched forms. The fiat-bottomed Woodward
Plain jar is also present. Shaeffer has suggested a date of A.D. 1300 for
the Nagle complex.
It is assumed by most Mississippi Valley archeologists that shell
tempering, as a characteristic of Mississippian cultures, originated
somewhere between Memphis and St. Louis and spread out from there.
Under this assumption, which has not yet been proved, the shell
tempering known from the Caddoan area would be viewed as having
spread from east to west. Not only have the sites listed above, Craig,
Brackett, and Nagle, a considerable amount of shell-tempered pottery,
but they also have effigy bowls, human and blank face effigy bottles,
ring-stand bottles, and tripod forms which are much more at home in
the eastern Arkansas and southeast Missouri area than they are in the
Caddo country. Some of these were almost certainly carried in from
the developed Mississippian effigy complex. It is also possible that the
Barton Incised jar with Burial 61 at Spiro is a trade vessel. Williams
and Goggin (1956: 64) regard Barton Incised as a Late Mississippi

type; and while the style of decoration is not necessarily always late
(Phillips, Ford, and Griffin, 1951:114-i 19), its association with strap
handles is bound to be relatively late within the Mississippi period,
if comparative and stratigraphic information is significant in archeological interpretation.
The correlations and identifications made above do strengthen the
position taken in earlier papers (Griffin, 1946: 85-92; Griffin, 1952).
The first of these papers was largely written in 1939 and 1940 and in
no way followed or was stimulated by Ford and Willey (1941). The
second was a presentation designed to point out the impossibility of
Kriegerâs (Newell and Krieger, 1949) interpretations, which I think
Baerreis unfortunately followed in the paper mentioned above. It is

CADDOAlXI AREA AND THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY

31

curious that Baerreis included the spud or elongate celt as a component
of an early Spiro Ceremonial Complex when I thought I had indicated
its presence not only at some of the major sites listed by Baerreis but
also at other sites in the east, including some rather securely within
the mature Mississippi and Southern Cult period. Furthermore, it
should have been clear that Spiro is on the extreme western margin
of the distribution of this form and that Gahagan is on the southwestern margin of its distribution. Baerreis apparently wrote much of his
paper by 1943 and may not have cared to substantially revise or reorient it before publication in ! 957.
Baerreis also included large chipped stone blades, such as those illustrated by Hamilton (1952: P1.46), but it is my understanding that
a significant proportion of these are made from Duck l~iver flint from
western Tennessee, and this same material and form appears at a number of centers in the Southeast of the Southern Cult. It might also be
added that at ]east some of the polished flint celts at Spiro were made
from a whitish flint from the Cahokia area and that these same polished celts are also found at that site.
The Caddoan style ear spools which Baerreis has grouped into a
number of distinctive types are another matter, and somewhat difficult to deal with, because their distribution is largely within a relatively
restricted area of the general Caddoan territory. There may well be a
sequence of development within the Caddoan area, but Baerreis has
not presented it because of the lack of sound stratigraphic or temporal
placement at the time he wrote his paper. We can, however, do something with the designs of the decorated ear spools. The cross and the
excised multipointed star and cross are conspicuous elements of the
Southern Cult, while the six-pointed star and the six-pointed star and
eye are found on painted pottery vessels of the cult period in the central Mississippi Valley. In fact, a significant number of the designs
on the distinctive Caddoan ear spools are ones held in common during
the period of the growth and spread of the So~lthern Cult. The history
of the various types of Caddoan ear spools should not be equated with
the history of the various designs which appear on them. The designs
I have just mentioned are ones which are apparently on the western
margin of their distribution and have moved to the Spiro Focus ear
spools which are a localized Caddoan development. The historic development of the Caddoan ear spools needs to be carefully worked out,
now that an acceptable classification has been provided, and also careful studies made of the historical development of the designs associated
with the Southern Cult.

TEXAS AtlCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

A few years ago, while Gregory Perino was excavating Mound 34
at Cahokia and in the surrounding area, for the Thomas Gilcrease
Foundation, Mr. Gilcrease found a cache of eleven stone ear spools
3" in diameter. Some of these have a circle and square design on the
outer face. They had been covered with copper and were found in the
cemetery area between Mounds 19 and 20. W. K. Moorehead (1929:
Plate XXVII, Fig. 6) illustrates what I take to be a Spiro type ear
spool from the same ttamey property area. In the University of Michigan excavations at Mound 34 we recovered materials which, because
of their quality and variety, we regarded as representative of the
Cahokia "climax." This climax was postulated as taking place at the
close of the Old Village Focus, or to use Kidderâs term "phase," of
Middle Mississippi development at Cahokia. It was also postulated that
this climax occurred after the splinter groups had moved north to
Aztalan, the northern Mississippi Valley, and into the central Mississippi Valley. We found, at Mound 34, examples of Caddoan style
engraving on sherds and an engraved "conch" shell fragment.
In Perinoâs more extensive excavations in the same mound were a
number of Caddoan-like highly polished engraved sherds with shell
temper, additional examples of engraved conch shells, negativepainted sherds suggestive of southeast Missouri and Nashville negative painting (Phillips, Ford, and Griffin, 1951: 173-177), and the
small stemmed points of jasper which are clearly intrusive from the
Caddoan area. At present we can state that on the basis of a radiocarbon date from beneath Mound 34 (M-33, Crane, 1956) at A.D.
1159--+ 200, and on M-635 (Crane and Griffin, 1959) for a "ceremonial" fire in association with activities at the mound after it was
built at A.D. 1289 --+ 200, that the complex with rather clear association
with the Cahokia Climax and with Spiro, will date A.D. 1150 to 1300,
give or take a few years. We can be reasonably certain that the protoChiwere movement north from Cahokia, with its Old Village economy,
took place around A.D. 1000 or a bit earlier (Griffin, 1960).
The pipe complex as presented by Baerreis deserves some comments,
for the varieties of pipe forms in the Caddoan area should be amenable
to both classification and a temporal alignment. Baerreis recognized
that there were a variety of pipes Go which the term "T-shaped" had
been applied and that a number of distinctive variations should be
segregated and described. For the class of pipes with a long base projection beyond the bowl and in the same line and of about the same
length as the stem, he proposed the term "equal arm." This same term
was given by Deuel (1935: 435, and Fig. 5, No. 9) to the elbow pipe

GADDOAIâ~ AI~EA AND THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY

33

form usually made of clay which he called a "determinant" of the
Mississippi Culture. For the "equal arm" pipe of Deuel, Baerreis uses
the term "elbow" pipe. The "T-shape" term he applies only to a form
with a short stem about equal to a basal projection beyond the bowl.
This section of Baerreisâ paper provided a bit heavy going because of
the changes in terminology and the necessity of checking the literature
in order to have an understanding of the grouping he had in mind.
The pipe forms selected by him as representative of the Spiro Ceremonial Complex were the equal arm and T-shape forms as defined
by Bae~eis, the stone pipe with short stem projection, and the human
and animal effigy forms. There can be no question that these forms are
associated with ceremonial activities in the major Spiro sites. Such
common pipe forms as the pottery elbow form and the long distinctive
tubular stem and small bowl set near the end of the tube are eliminated
from consideration on the curious ground that "they are frequently
encountered in ordinary village refuse which may perhaps imply that
they had a more secular than ceremonial function." This decision was
made even though one of the latter forms was with burials at Gahagan,
was found at the Davis site, and with burials at Mineral Springs,
Haley, Norman, and other important Caddoan sites. Why could these
forms not have had different functions at different times?
The effigy pipes at Spiro and at Norman are compared to those at
Gahagan, and Baerreis suggests that the "Caddoan" effigy pipes are a
part of the Spiro Ceremonial Complex. He also recognized that some
effigy pipes were a part of the Southern Cult, "particularly the bird
form," but believes that they were incorporated into it at a later time
than the effigy pipes which are at Spiro and Gahagan. In my discussion
of the Spiro pipe complex (Griffin, 1952: 90-92) it was argued that
the effigy pipes of Spiro and Gahagan were styles which were clearly
Middle Mississippi, in form and in their distribution, and that there
was no reason to attribute temporal priority for them at Spiro or in
the Caddoan area.
The "cloud-blower" pipe at Gahagan (Moore, 1912: 514-519) is,
I think, very clearly a Middle Mississippi form in its sculpturing and
features. From Mooreâs photograph I suggest that the small light spots
may be shell tempering in this pottery effigy pipe. After I had written
the previous sentence, I asked F. J. Dockstader in New York to check
this pipe and see if it were not shell tempered. His reply on March 4.
196t, says:
in answer to your request for information concerning our clay effigy
pipe (] 7/479) from the Gahagan Site in Louisiana, I have examined this

34

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

specimen and in my opinion the tempering is very finely ground shell,
the clay is the usual light brown material with indications of firing, the
particles of shell are quite small and the whole texture of the material
compares quite favorably with most of our Louisiana pottery. There do
not seem to be, numerically, as many shell particles in the composition of
this particular specimen as are found in many of the Louisiana-AlabamaMississippi pieces, but it is not unique in this respect since we also have
many which contain a low percentage of shell in the clay. There are no
large particles of the sort found commonly in large vessels, nor are they
as profuse as, for example, some of those in the material from the Crable
Site. I mention this latter only because I happened to have some of these
on the table at the same time I was examining the C. B. Moore piece and
know you also have a goodly amount of it.
The frog and human effigy pipes at Gahagan are forms which are
well known in Mississippi period sites to the north and east. The best
human effigy pipes similar to the superb group from the Craig Mound
are from the Pittsburgh Landing (Shiloh Battlefield) site in western
Tennessee, and from Moundville (West, 1934: P1. III), which seems
to have a connection with the Southern Cult. A pipe of the same character is illustrated by Thruston (1890:188) from near Kingston, Tennessee, and he also reports a similar pipe from the Oldtown area along
the Harpeth River in central Tennessee.
Williams and Goggin (1956) have discussed the "Big Boy" pipe
from Spiro and pointed out the human face ear plug on both sides of
the head as a representation of the Long Nosed God. This is probably
true, but the sculptured form on the pipe is closer to the small shell
replicas than it is to the specific copper effigy forms with their striking
nose projection. They have employed "The Long Nosed God" as a
horizon marker indicating a short time spread, but we cannot be certain that this is the case. For example, I am sceptical of their assignment of the shell replicas to the same period as the copper forms at
Aztalan. Now it should be noted that "Big Boy" wears a disc-like hair
ornament over his forehead that bears an "ogee" symbol, so intimately
associated with the Southern Cult that Waring and Holder suggested it
was an anus symbol. Attention might also be directed toward the magnificent human effigy pipe from Muskogee County, Oklahoma, which
was formerly in the Whelpley Collection and is now housed in the St.
Louis Art Museum (Fundaburk and Foreman, 1957: P1. 95-96). This
figure is in the act of participating in a chunkee game and holds a fine
discoidal stone of the biconcave type in his right hand. As a result of
these observations on the effigy pipes at Spiro, I reach the conclusion

CADDOAI~ AREA AIND THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY

35

that so far as we can tell at present the pipes are on the same general
time level as many expressions of the Southern Cult and that Â°~Big
Boy" is probably not on the same time level as the copper Long Nosed
God masks.
There must be a temporal sequence of pipe forms in the Caddoan
area, and one of the early forms of the Mississippi period should be
the long tubular stem forms with the small bowl set at, or near, one
end of the tube; some varieties of Baerreisâ T-shaped form and other
varieties of the projecting stem; and perhaps some of the elbow form.
All of these may be viewed as developments from the platform pipe of
I-Iopewell time, with regional styles appearing in the Caddoan area.
They are local expressions of the general shift to the elbow form which
took place all over the eastern area in post-Hopewe!l time. With due
reserve it is proposed that the effigy complex associated with pipe
smoking in Hopewell times evolved through the large steatite and
other stone forms of the Kentucky-Tennessee area into the effigy complex of the Mississippian cultures.

Summary
My purpose at the Caddoan symposium was to suggest that the developed Caddoan ceremonial complex, in so fat as it could be recognized as a complex, was on the same general time level as much of the
Southern Cult. We do not yet have the skill and the techniques to
recognize and clearly differentiate the growing complexity of the ceremonial life of the Southeastern agricultural communities. The artifact styles certainly evolve through time and we will eventually be
able to see segments of the Mississippian culture development and
thus the growth and decline of its ceremonial expression. It is difficult
now to pin-point those traits which are early and those which are
clearly late. Some efforts have been made in that direction. None of
them, however, leads me to the conclusion that the known Spiro Ceremonial Complex is earlier than the Southern Cult, or as A. J. Waring,
Jr., M.D., prefers to call it, the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. I
well remember that at the close of my talk at the symposium that Dr.
Alex Krieger remarked to the audience, "Griffin has proved his point."

Discussion
By Philip Phillips
At the time of the Symposium I felt that Griffin had certainly made
his point. After re-reading his and Baerreisâ paper I still think so, but
I must admit that the questions involved are a little complicated. The
artifact types designated by Baerreis as possibly reflecting an early
"Spiro Ceremonial Complex" show considerable internal development,
presumably involving a fair amount of time. Until the details of such
development are more clearly understood, any conclusions as to
whether there is a Spiro Ceremonial Complex (as distinct from the
Southern Cult), as well as its tempora! relationships to the Cult, will
remain hypothetical, which Baerreis himself admits. The exact nature
of the Southern Cult and the tempora! relationships between the various cult centers in the Southeast are equally nebulous. As Griffin points
out, here also there is considerable development and time depth. Knebergâs (1959) recent study of engraved shell gorgets of the Dallas
culture is an example of the kind of analysis all so.called Southern
Cult artifacts must be given before we can begin to talk about Cult
relationships with any confidence. It has long been my opinion that
if and when such studies are completed the idea of a closely knit and
rapidly disseminated complex will have undergone drastic modification and that the word "Cult" will disappear from the literature.
If we are not ready for a final showdown on the question of the
specific relationships of Spiro to other Cult centers in the Southeast,
nevertheless a good deal can be said about Spiro in the general context

38

Tt~XAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

of chronological relationships between the Caddoan and Lower Mississippi areas. My remarks at the Symposium attempted to summarize in
the briefest possible way these relationships as they appear from that
portion of the Lower Mississippi that I know most about. I have taken
the liberty of deleting some of the most palpable errors and have
altered the chronological estimates in line with recent radiocarbon
dates.
Cultural sequences in the alluvial valley of the Lower Mississippi
begin with the Poverty Point culture, a number of regional phases of
which have now been dated. These range from about 1500 to 500 B.C.
Except for the Calion site on the Ouachita River in Southern Arkansas,
this culture does not seem to have penetrated the Caddoan area, where
at this time there was a relatively undifferentiated late Archaic culture
without Poverty Point elaborations. Towards the end of the period
fiber-tempered pottery appeared in the Lower Mississippi, but so far
we have not found any pure components that would lend a name to a
fiber-tempered phase.
In the succeeding Tchefuncte culture there seem to have been attenuated connections in coastal Texas and possibly here and there in
the Caddoan area. Various speakers at the Fifth Conference on Caddoan Archeology have referred to sand-tempered pottery in an otherwise East Texas Archaic context that might be related to the sandtempered assemblages that have been described as associated with the
predominantly clay-tempered Tchefuncte and Tchula complexes of
Louisiana and Mississippi.
About the time of Christ, perhaps a little earlier, we find the Marksville culture well established in the lower valley. There are almost
certainly undiscovered earlier phases. In a site on the lower Sunflower River in Mississippi, Greengo found sherds closely related to
the Havana ware of Illinois Hopewell, almost certainly older than the
classic Marksville pottery from Louisiana. In the later phases of this
culture, Troyville in Louisiana, Issaquena in Mississippi, we get the
first signs of contact with the Caddoan area. The sherds illustrated by
Krieger (Newell and Krieger, 1949: Fig. 50) as evidence of contact
between the Davis site and Marksville, in my opinion, based only on
inspection of the illustrations, bear no such interpretation. Only one
sherd out of the lot (Fig. 50, Q) looks as though it might have come
from the Lower Mississippi, and this I believe is Troyville. This sherd~
from the primary mound fill, hence Davis 1 or earlier, iust about bears
the whole weight of the Davis-Marksville equation~ upon which in
turn rests a good deal of Kriegerâs contention that the Spiro florescence

CADDOAN AREA AND THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY

39

was in Troyville times. In the main, penetration of Marksville-Troyrifle pottery into the Caddoan area does not seem to have gone very
far--up the Red River to the Shreveport region (Bellevue phase) and
up the Ouachita to the vicinity of Arkadelphia (Kirkham and Cooper
sites). In this period the Caddoan area seems to be in a peripheral
situation vis-a-vis the Lower Mississippi, and the Caddoan culture has
not yet been formed.
Beginning with the onset of the Coles Creek-Plaquemine culture
(we badly need a name to express this continuity), about A.D. 500,
the picture changes. By this time the ~VVeeden Island and Caddoan
cultures must also have been developing in their respective areas and
there are signs of contact along an east-west Gulf coastal axis. There
was a considerable thrust of Coles Creek influence into the Caddoan
area, and possibly actual phases of Coles Creek culture in Crenshaw
I and ~Webbâs "Red River Alto" sites. In the earlier part of this long
continuity, i.e., the part represented by specifically Coles Creek phases
(Williams has been able to distinguish three successive Coles Creek
phases in the Lake George site dating from about A.D. 500 to I000), the
direction of influence still seems to have been from east to west. In the
later Coles Creek-Plaquemine phases, i.e., those represented by the
Plaquemine end of the continuum, there seems to have been, for the
first time perhaps, a real interchange between the two areas. Perhaps
we should say a three-way interchange, because the developing Mississippi culture, especially in its spectacular Cahokia phase, played an
important role. This was the time of big ceremonial centers, of an influx (though not the first) of Middle American elements, the time of
great emphasis on polished pottery, engraving, excising, bottle and
carinated bowls forms, etc., a most exciting moment in the Lower
Mississippi and Caddoan areas.
At the very end of the long Coles Creek-Plaquemine period, exemplified by the Mayersville phase in the Lower Yazoo and by Cotterâs
Plaquemine components in the great Natchezan sites, the first evidences of the Southern Cult appear. ~Â¢Villiams has Mayersville at the
Lake George site fairly well dated at A.D. 1200 to 1400. This, in my
opinion, is the time of the most intense developments at Spiro. It was
followed, in the Lower Yazoo sequence by the first fully developed
Mississippi phase (Lake George), and farther south by the Natchezan, in which, it seems to me, the element of continuity from Coles
Creek-Plaquemine was stronger than the impact of Mississippi culture. In this respect the late Caddoan cultures were more like Natchezan. They were never swamped by Mississippi.

40

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

It is this last point that I would emphasize in closing. I was rather
surprised at the Symposium to hear Caddoan culture so often described
as Mississippi. Perhaps this is nothing more than deference to a
revered but no longer viable system of classification. If I were laboring in the Caddoan vineyard, I would stress the individuality of
Caddoan culture, its independence of, not to say resistance to, the
spread of Mississippi culture.
If my remarks have contributed to Griffinâs assault on the priority
of Spiro over eastern centers of the Southern Cult~ they are in no sense
a disparagement of the essential integrity of Spiro as one of the most
intense and fascinating cultures of the eastern United States.

I shall take this opportunity to clarify some of my comments made
following Griffinâs presentation at the Symposium and to add certain
data and new ideas which Griffinâs revised article and recent developments have elicited.
Griffin certainly has presented a lot of strong evidence for the relatively late date of most of the ceremonial material at Spiro and related Caddoan sites. I find myself in complete agreement with most
of his statements on dating, and surely the time is soon coming (if it
is not already here) when absohlte dating throughout the Southeast
will make any further discussion of Hopewellian (circa 300 B.C.--A.D.
200) connections with Spiro, Craig Mound (circa A.D. 1100--1300),
as obsolete as Mr. Mooreheadâs six-inch soil auger.
With regard to the "Long Nosed God," I agree with Griffin in his
suggestion that the representation on the "Big Boy" pipe is more like
the small shell forms. I also accept his suggestion that there may be a
time differential in the classic form of Long Nosed God representation
which was somewhat lost sight of in our article (Williams and Goggin, 1956), although the temporal position of the later expressions of
a long-nosed being, as on the Walls Engraved vessel (Fig. t8, B), was

CADDOAIâ,7 AREA AIâ~D TI-IE IVIISSISSIPPI VALLEY

41

clearly stated. However, all the copper forms (Big Mound, Gahagan,
Aztalan, Grant Mound) are certainly similar enough to suggest an
horizon marker of rather short temporal dimension. I understand that
another pair of these copper masks has recently been excavated in
Oklahoma (William H. Sears, personal communication), but I am not
certain of their cultural association. As was noted (Williams and
Goggin, 1956: 37), some of the small shell Long Nosed God masks
are surely later and may be ancestral to the large shell mask gorgets
dated by Kneberg (1959) after A.D. 1360. Further evidence for a late
date for the short-nosed form has recently been presented by Griffin
and Morse (1961).
Gregory Perino has recently excavated another pair of small shell
Long Nosed God masks from the Cahokia region in what is presumably
an Old Village context, and this evidence tends to strengthen the temporal placement of the Big Mound specimen (Williams and Goggin,
1956: Table 3).
In the volume cited above (fbfd.: 62), three alternative chronological interpretations were offered:
(1) The Long Nosed God masks and associated traits temporally
precede the inception of the Mississippian culture and its attendant
but slightly later Southern Cult.
(2) The Long Nosed God masks date from an Early Mississippi
period and precede the full development of the Cult.
(3) The masks are on a mature Mississippi time horizon during a
period of developed Southern Cult symbolism, but occur in areas not
strongly affected by the Cult, and as such are just a counterpart to the
better known Cult symbols at the major centers.
Five years later the senior author is still of the opinion that No. 2
is the best, but I feel even more strongly that No. 1 is impossible. A
full exposition and analysis of the third interpretation still awaits
detailed chronological studies in the Caddoan area and at Cahokia.
Some eleven radiocarbon dates recently obtained from the Lake
George site, Yazoo County, Mississippi, make it evident that the Classic
Southern Cult connections, which seem to be on a Plaquemine level
in the Lower Valley, must date well after A.D. 1000 and most probably
at A.D. 1300 --+ 100. A temple structure atop Mound A contained a
vessel with a late Cult rattlesnake design (A. J. Waring identification)
and dated very close to A.D. 1500.
With regard to chronology, it must be remembered that the major
sites usually discussed in relation to the "Southeastern Ceremonial

42

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Complex" (Cahokia, Spiro, Moundville, and Etowah) are all large villages with a considerable time span. Radiocarbon dates at Lake
George show nearly a thousand years of occupation; and certainly
Cahokia, with its various ceramic components, must encompass as
much or more time. The sherd counts from Moundville (Wimberly,
1956) indicate a long occupation of varying intensity, and Etowah
has shown appreciable time depth too, although Mound C is evidently
quite homogeneous and relatively late. Spiro is acknowledged to have
some time depth whether one accepts Orrâs three-part division of the
material or not.
My point is that while it is too easy to think of all these sites and
their associated material as on a single narrow time horizon, and
likewise too easy to wrench single undated items from these complex
situations and fit them into a convenient scheme, nonetheless I do feel
confident that certain horizon style phenomena can be used successfully. I would defend the copper Long Nosed God masks as belonging
to this category, and I feel that certain "Classic Cult" items in copper,
such as the eagle warrior and related forms, are good time markers.
However, because of the long time spans at the sites in question, I am
sure that some of the other items which we may be casually comparing
in our trait lists may be as much as 500 years too early (boat stones?)
or 200 years too late (decadent form of shell gorgets). This statement
is but an expansion of Griffinâs final point, but one which needs
emphasizing.
In terms of space rather than time, the problem of Cahokia-Caddoan
ties is vexing too. The recent discovery of Cahokia-like material in
Arkansas by Gregory Perino, coupled with some Barney Incised sherds
from the Lake George site, gives evidence of northern influence coming
rather directly down the Mississippi. The Red River connections in
these cultural transmissions are at present rather unclear, but it seems
apparent that they are not on the classic Coles Creek time horizon,
A.D. 750 -----100. It is striking that engraving, such an important Caddoan trait, does not appear in the Lower Yazoo Basin until late Plaquemine times, circa A.D. 1300--+ 100. There must have been a strong
cultural barrier preventing the diffusion of this particular trait down
the Red River, whereas highly polished plain pottery, often suggested
as a correlative treatment, appears in late Coles Creek times, or even
earlier.
Thus it appears that, although there remains a vast amount of detailed analysis and area synthesis to be done, certain broad limits can
now be set on the problems involved.

Yes, Griffin has proved the point that shell-tempered pottery may
occasionally turn up in a grave with artifacts typical of Spiro Focus.
The matter has been obscure, but I see no reason to question the validity of Griffinâs careful documentation of grave vessels. The occurrence
of shell-tempered Woodward Plain sherds in some of these sites (but
not in graves) is, however, of questionable meaning in connection with
Spiro Focus because these sites do give evidence of more than one
occupation. The "cloud-blower" pipe from Gahagan may also be shelltempered, but Dockstaderâs statement, quoted by Griffin, suggests caution in that the shell particles are said to be infrequent. In such cases-by no means rare--it may be difficult if not impossible to prove that
such particles were intentionally added as a tempering agent. Otherwise, Griffinâs observations do not change the generality that shell
temper is completely absent or exceedingly rare in all Caddoan foci
except some which date close to the appearance of European trade
goods, or afterward, as in Fort Coffee, McCurtain, and Glendora.
At the outset, Griffin refers to his 1952 paper on the place of Spiro
in Southeastern archeology. In it, as he says, he belabored certain
views of Caddoan development "which Krieger favored at the time,"
and states that most students of the subject either failed to read it or
were so disenchanted that they made no attempt to refute it. In the first
place, this paper was largely devoted to showing that Spiro shares

many more traits with Mississippian cultures than it does with Hopewellian, which no one has ever denied; and in the second place, it was
intended to show the "impossibility" of the second of two alternative
interpretations of the relationships between Gibson Aspect foci-including Spiro--and other Southeastern cultures which I presented
in the Davis site monograph (Newell and Krieger, 1949: 219-224).
The first and more orthodox alternative was not mentioned. If a defense were needed for my !949 study, I can only say that alternative
interpretations are desirable in any situation; and if one or more of
them can be effectively disproved, no one has been hurt, and the disproving evidence (if such it is) is itself a contribution to knowledge.
Anyone interested can read or re-read pages 223-224 of the Davis site
monograph and decide whether the two alternatives were fairly stated.
I think they were and that the second, decidedly unorthodox interpretation served a purpose in stimulating some thought on the subject.
In his 1952 study of Spiro and in the present paper, Griffin has
neglected to account for a number of intriguing resemblances between
Spiro and its close affiliates in the Caddoan area on the one hand, and
Hopewell (or late Hopewell) on the other, such as burial customs,
several kinds of copper artifacts, "napkin-ring" earspools, Copena
"points" or knives, and the near-identify in facial expression as well
as knobs (representing hair-dos?) on human effigy pipes from Spiro
and on Hopewellian clay figurines. Although the ceramics of Spiro
and Hopewell are, of course, totally different, many archeologists
have recognized extensive carry-over of non-ceramic traits from Hopewell to Mississippian or Mississippian-connected cultures, which implies that the latter may have begun to germinate before Hopewell had
disappeared or at any rate that there was no great time lapse between
them. This situation was specifically predicted by Ford and Willey as
long ago as 1940, when they said that
Intensive investigations in the central part of the Mississippi Valley will
very probably show that the widespread Middle Mississippi cultures were
developing at the same time, principally from Hopewellian. One result to
be expected.., is that traits directly comparable to those of Hopewellian
will appear sporadically in peripheral Mississippian cultures and in the
adjacent Woodland cultures...

This passage was quoted in Newell and Krieger (1949: 223) and I
firmly believe it is valid today, not only in the interpretation of Spiro
and other Gibson Aspect foci, but in various situations east of the
Mississippi l~iver, if we use the term "Mississippian cultures" in a

CADDOAiXI AREA AND THE ~ISSISSIPPI VALLEY

very broad sense--of which, more below-. It is also borne out by radiocarbon datings, but here we are up against a very strange attitude
among many eastern archeologists, who now accept the fact that Hopewell is dated by this method at about 400 B.c. to A.D. 100 or 200 (the
ending date is by no means clear), but who fiercelv~ contend that any
datings older than A.D. 900 or even ii00 for Mississippian cultures
(again using this term in the "old" or very broad sense) cannot possibly be valid. This dilemma may, perhaps, be escaped by restricting
the term Mississippian to what has long been called "Middle ~4[ississipplan," but this still leaves us with the question of what went on in the
central parts of the eastern United States during the 800 or i000 years
between Hopewellian and "Middle Mississippian." This dilemma has
recently been pointed out by Caldwell (1958: 64) in respect to the
Southern Cult horizon, which may be taken as coeval with "Middle
Mississippian:"
Willey has recently pointed out that, in a general way, these incised
designs on Santa Rosa pottery are reminiscent of Southern Cult motifs.
The bird, the hand with symbol on or in it, and the sun are among the
three most important features of Southern Cult symbolism. But Santa Rosa
must belong to the first centuries A.D. while the cult is provisionally
datable to more than ]000 years later.

Caldwell (1958: 58) also quotes Willey regarding a fourth element,
i.e., that "the common Mississippian idea of effigy pottery forms occurred on the Florida Coast as early as Santa Rosa times..." To account
for this supposed gap of 1000 years, Caldwell (1958: 59) advances the
hypothesis that many basic "Mississippian" traits were already present
in the Southeast at an earlier time as part of the "Gulf Tradition:"
Present opinion regarding the formation of Mississippian culture is that
it arose in the central portion of the Valley sometime prior to 1000 A.D.
To judge from the cultural mixture represented, it can be proposed that
the Mississippian Tradition represents some kind of fusion of local elements of that area with other elements which had already appeared in
the Gulf Tradition immediately southward (Willey and Phillips 1955).
Temple mound and plaza, ceramic effigy vessels in animal, vegetable, and
human forms, effigy rim adornos and painted vessels are all documented
earlier in the Gulf Tradition, geographically between the Nuclear American area from which they are supposed to have been derived and the
presumptive heartland of the Mississippian area of which they later became most characteristic. That Nuclear America was the ultimate source
of these ideas seems reasonable, but we should also expect them to have

TEXAS AIICHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

been in some degree modified by their residence in the Gulf Tradition

before being reformulated as Mississippian.
Under the older conception of a generalized Mississippian Pattern
or Culture we would have said that the basic traits of presumably
Middle American or Nuclear American origin appeared at some time
in the eastern United States, initiating this Pattern or Culture, and
that "Middle Mississippian" developed out of it in the central sections
of the Mississippi Valley. Now, if we follow Caldwell, these traits are
said to appear first in the Southeast as part of the "Gulf Tradition,"
from where they moved into a "Mississippian Tradition" of much
more limited scope--geographically and temporally--than the former
Mississippian Pattern (or Culture). In other words, the cultural situation is about the same, but a different set of terms is used to describe
it. Caldwell does not attempt a precise dating for the beginning of his
"Mississippian Tradition," except to say that its formation began some
time prior to A.D. 1000. He also thinks that the Southern Cult complex should date at A.D. 1200 or 1300. It is thus apparent from his
own arguments that there are at least two cultural horizons or periods
which bear the label of "Mississippian" in one way or another; one
earlier than the Southern Cult, and a later one which has this Cult.
A third might be added: Mississippian material extending into historic
times, which either has no Southern Cult material or has only greatly
attentuated expressions of it.
Returning to the Caddoan area, I can see no particular reason for
Caldwellâs placement of this entire block of archeological material in
the Gulf Tradition rather than the Mississippian; if a choice had to
be made, I would think the latter more logical. More important, we
may ask whether or not the Caddoan block might also be subdivided
into (A) a period preceding Southern Cult phenomena; (B) one with
this Cult; and (C) one extending into historic times which either lacks
Cult expressions or reveals them only in meager, attenuated form. It
is my opinion that all the analysis of Caddoan archeological material
to date does support three such subdivisions.
Griffin obiects to Baerreisâ analysis of the Spiro material into (A) a
Spiro Ceremonial Complex which has certain "Mississippian" traits
but not the specific elements of the Southern Cult; and (B) a Spiro
Focus in which the Cult is a predominating feature. This subdivision
is called "unsound and unsatisfactory" by Griffin, apparently on the
grounds that some or most of the traits listed by Baerreis for the Spiro
Ceremonial Complex can be found elsewhere in association with specific Cult traits.

CADDOAN AREA AND THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY

47

This objection seems to me to be illogical. In the first place, Baerreis
himself (1957: 34) was quite aware that the temporal isolation of the
traits defining his "Spiro Ceremonial Complex" did not preclude their
also occurring alongside of Cult traits after the Cult developed. Second,
all students of this subject have realized the urgent need for a breakdown of post-Hopewellian archeological material, widely over the
eastern United States, into traits which are of general occurrence in
the "Mississippian" and "Gulf" traditions, and those which may be
specifically assigned to a Southern Cult complex; and Baerreis is one
of the few to attempt such a breakdown or finer distinction in a local
situation. Third, Baerreis, like some other archeologists, was concerned
with reconciling the presence or continuity of Hopewellian nonceramic traits in a site like Spiro with a gap of some thousand years
that is supposed to separate them. Fourth, there are other situations in
the eastern United States which also point to at least two and probably
three periods within the Mississippian and Gulf traditions after Hopewellian times. We have already mentioned Caldwellâs thesis of 1958.
Two years previously, Williams and Goggin (1956) made an exhaustive study of eastern United States prehistory in order to establish
the temporal and cultural position of the Long Nosed God masks of
copper and shell. They likewise arrived at the conclusion (see their
Table 3) that there is evidence for two general periods, the first or
earlier one containing the Long Nosed God masks but not the Southern
Cult; and the later one containing the developed Cult. The two general
periods were called "Early" and "Late" Mississippian. In this case,
too, a third period could have been added, beginning well before historic times but extending into them, during which the Cult was absent
or greatly attenuated. The "Spiro I" phase in Williams and Gogginâs
chart (Table 3) presumably corresponds with Baerreisâ "Spiro Geremortal Complex," preceding the "Spiro II" phase with its Southern
Cult. Williams and Goggin (1956: 52-63) have also stated that
If the supposition that the Long Nosed God mask can act as a horizon
marker is accepted, then it becomes a cultural phenomenon with equivalent temporal import for the archeology of eastern North America as the
classic bird design on pottery of the Hopewellian manifestation, or the
fine repouss6 copper plates showing the human figure in rich ceremonial
paraphernalia, characteristic of the highest development of the Southern
Cult... (italics mine).

If the Long Nosed God motif is, indeed, comparable to the bird
designs of Hopewell in "temporal import," it may not be simply a
"horizon marker," implying a very short duration, but a marker for

48

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

a cultural period which endured for some centuries. This is because
the Long Nosed God masks constitute only one trait--a very readily
recognized one--which is only a small part of the cultural assemblages
in which they have been found.
At any rate, from the time perspectives gained for all eastern United
States culture periods through radiocarbon dating, longer life-spans
for the post-Hopewe!lian periods should no longer be surprising or
combatted as unreasonable: we have only to reflect for a moment on
the many confident statements made during the 1930âs and 1940âs
about the age of eastern United States cultures, with the Archaic
"dated" at 500 B.C. to A.D. 500 (or later), Hopewell "dated" at A.D.
1000 or 1200, and so on!
The radiocarbon datings on post-Hopewellian cultures are, of course,
very confusing at present. I donât know what can be done about it
except to obtain many more datings with all due attention to exact
associations with specific cuhural assemblages. Some of these datings
appear to support the "short" versions of Mississippian chronology,
like those cited by Griffin in his paper. Others, like the measurements
reaching into the centuries before Christ at the Spiro site, are impossibly old. A few, obtained recently, may be more reasonable if only
because they cluster around an intermediate position. In Radiocarbon
Supplement (Vol. 2, 1960: 37-38) there are four datings from sites in
eastern Oklahoma, determined by the University of Michigan laboratory, all on charcoal. These are:
Sample M-816, Craig Mound at Spiro site: 1170 --- 150 years ago
Sample M-817, Hughes site: 1050 - 150 years ago
Sample M-818, Norman site: 1050 -+ 150 years ago
Sample M-819, Reed site: 1 !00 +- !50 years ago
To these may be added an age determination of 1100 -+ 100 years
ago at Level IV of the Belcher Mound in northwestern Louisiana
(letter from C. H. Webb dated November 27, 1959). Belcher Level IV
has nothing to do with the much later Belcher Focus; it is a component
of the Haley Focus, which Webb and I have long regarded as somewhat later in time than the classic Spiro Focus with its spectacular
Southern Cult material. The four other dates just mentioned may or
may not apply specifically to the time of Southern Cult florescence in
eastern Oklahoma~ the published reports on these sites place them in
the Gibson Aspect but focal assignments present difficulties, and the
date of 1100 +-100 B.P. for the Haley component at Belcher possibly indicates that all five dates are relatively late in the Gibson

49
Aspect. The Spiro Ceremonial Complex of Baerreis may then be
earlier than the span of about A.D. 790 Â± 150 to 910 Â± 150 for these
five dates and thus closer to the end of Hopewellian times.
Radiocarbon dates as early as 960 -+ 250 B.P. for the Trappist Focus
and 910 +- 200 B.P. for a grave with cult objects at Etowah have also
CADDOAN AREA AIND THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY

been obtained (Radiocarbon Supplement, Vol. 1, 1959, sample M-670
on page 181 and Sample M-542 on page 188). Younger dates have
been obtained on the same cultural horizons, but I cite these two as
examples of dates which are usually discarded in favor of younger

ones.
So far in this critique I have not questioned the assumption of others
that the Southern Cult was a single, rapidly-spreading ceremonial
phenomenon of comparatively short duration in the prehistory of the
Eastern United States. However, I have long doubted that this was
true. A thorough analysis of the whole Southern Cult concept is long
overdue, not only to separate it from more generalized "Mississippian"
traits, but to define different "chapters" of this Cult, each of which
would show emphasis on different kinds of symbolism even though a
few elements might be common to all. This is not the time or place
to attempt such a study, nor am I close enough to the material any
more to attempt it myself. Williams and Goggin (1956: Table 2) have
itemized scores of culture traits at nine important Mississippian sites,
but aside from removal of the Long Nosed God motif from the Southern Cult and placing it in an earlied period, they made no attempt at
a new and more precise definition of the Cult itself. Their trait list
should, however, provide an excellent springboard for such a further
analysis. My guess is that when more complete datings are available,
significant time differences for Cult expressions will emerge in such
widely separated areas as Oklahoma, the central Mississippi and lower
Ohio valleys, Wisconsin, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, etc.
Returning for a moment to the matter of shel!-tempered pottery,
Griffin states that "it is assumed by most Mississippi Valley archeologists that shell tempering, as a characteristic of Mississippian cultures,
originated somewhere between Memphis and St. Louis and spread out
from there." He admits that this assumption "has not yet been
proved;" it is probably based on the common belief that a trait must
have originated in the area where it reached its greatest popularity:
always a possibility, of course, but never to be taken for granted.
Griffin has apparently overlooked the paper by Proctor (1957) on
the Sam Site in Le Flore County, Oklahoma, the first detailed report
on a component of the Fourche Maline complex (or culture, or focus).

50

TEXAS

ARCHEOLOGICAL

SOCIETY

Orr (1952) considered Fourche Maline as most likely belonging to an
Early Woodland period, less likely to Middle Woodland (using Griffinâs terms). Krieger (!953) thought that it could only belong to the
Middle Woodland. Its pottery suggests some prototypes for Spiro Focus
but otherwise it is rather certainly pre-Caddoan. Proctor (1957: 59)
states that "Shell-tempered pottery which has been considered a
marker for the Fulton Aspect [in this area] appears in varying degrees
at all of the known Fourche Maline sites without altering the basic
trait list. At the Sam Site it occurs in the lowest pottery level and
Â¯ . . is roughly contemporaneous with all of the other types found at
the site." Proctor considers the alternative that shell temper may in
itself make Fourche Maline as late as Fulton Aspect, but nothing else
in the culture would support this position. If, then, as seems most
likely, Fourche Maline was pre-Spiro, the shell-tempered vessels listed
by Griffin in Spiro Focus context are not unexpected. Where, then,
did the shell tempering idea originate: in "Middle Mississippi," in
Fourche Maline, or in some other area which might be revealed by
better chronological control?
In summary, I hope I have made it clear that Griffinâs factual data
on the place of occurrence of various Mississippian traits is not being
questioned. I am, however, concerned with how this and other material is to be interpreted in terms of the whole structure of Mississippian culture. It is amazing that so little organizational progress has
been made since the excellent Burial Mound-Temple Mound scheme
of Ford and Willey in 1941. Griffinâs final paragraph shows his complete awareness of the same problems when he states that "We do not
yet have the skill and the techniques to recognize and clearly differentiate the growing complexity of the ceremonial life of the Southeastern agricultural communities .... It is difficult now to pin-point
those traits which are early and those which are clearly late." I think,
then, that we could do with fewer reassurances that so many relatively
late traits simply "originated in Middle Mississippian," and concentrate more on a general overhauling of post-Hopewellian chronology.

Relationships Between the Caddoan Area
and the Plains1
ROBERT E. BELL

It is my purpose to discuss the interrelationships between the
Caddoan Area and the Plains, focusing attention primarily upon Oklahoma and the states to the north, leaving the Texas side of the story
to my associates. Since Oklahoma lies in a strategic position, being
partly within the Caddoan Area and partly within the Southern
Plains, it is only natural that I should become interested in the relationships between these two areas. I would like to emphasize, however,
that many of the ideas suggested here are speculations based upon
occasional hints or on familiarity with the archeological materials.
Nevertheless, I think it worth while, perhaps an obligation, to occasionally evaluate what has been done, and to reconstruct from
available data something that may help in building an archeological
history. Later, after additional research, such ideas can be evaluated
and accepted, modified, or rejected. With this introduction, then, I
would like to comment upon Plains-Caddoan Area relationships as
I see them at this time.
In this discussion of the Caddoan Area I am referring essentially to
the time periods represented by the Gibson and Fulton aspects. The
Caddoan area is the territory formerly occupied by these peoples. Although earlier occupations are apparently represented in all parts of
this region, they do not become recognizable units until Gibson times.
Moreover, the areas occupied by the Gibson and Fulton groups do not
remain static and are not always identical.
Within eastern Oklahoma there are two nuclear areas: one centering along the Arkansas River and its tributaries, such as the Canadian,
Grand, Poteau, and Illinois in east-central Oklahoma, and another
centering along the Red River valley and its tributaries in southeastern
1 This paper was presented at a symposium entitled "Relationships between the
Caddoan Area and Neighboring Areas," which was a part of the program of the
23rd Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, held at the University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, May 1-3, 1958.

54

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Oklahoma. The rough, wooded country of the Ouachita Mountains
functioned as a natural divide between these two nuclear areas and
was apparently a more sparsely occupied frontier region.
As one moves westward across Oklahoma, the common archeological
materials represent a relatively late prehistoric occupation reflecting
a typical Plains gardening and bison-hunting economy. The Washita
River Focus (Bell and Baerreis, 1961), which is widespread in central
Oklahoma, would be a typical example. Farther to the west, the Custer
Focus (Bell and Baerreis, 1951; Brighton, 1961; Gallaher, 1951) is
found in the area around Clinton, and the Optima Focus (Watson,
1950; Bell and Baerreis, 1961) is found in the Oklahoma Panhandle.
All of these loci share a large number of traits and must be related to
one another in some way. The Optima Focus, by virtue of its proximity to the Southwest, has a number of features, one of which is
architecture, which must be ultimately derived from that region. As
a result of these influences, the Optima materials are the most divergent.
If one examines materials from a continuous series of sites, however,
starting with the Washita l~iver Focus in central Oklahoma and continning westward up the river valleys to the Custer and Optima areas,
there is a gradual transition from one locality to the other. My impression is one of an expansion of peoples moving into the Plains area,
originating in the east and following the main river valleys westward
ultimately to occupy their respective areas of the state. Differences
which occur throughout these areas are a reflection of borrowed ideas,
local specializations, or a taxonomic failure to consider the transitional
intervening areas.
The Washita River Focus is perhaps best known, and several sites
have been described in the literature (Schmitt, 1960; Bell and Baerreis, 1961; Schmitt and Toldan, 1953; Oakes, 1953; Lawton, 1958).
There are many other sites represented by test pit material or surface
collections that have not been published on as yet. The area of distribution and depth of occupation in the sites suggest that some lapse
of time is represented. Moreover, the occasional sherd, projectile point,
or stone artifact representing the Gibson period suggests an origin
from the east during late Gibson times. This eastern origin is further
supported by the lack of older, possibly ancestral, occupations in the
central Oklahoma area. Closely related manifestations in other localities are the Henrietta Focus along l~ed ]~iver in north-central Texas
(Krieger, 1946) and the Great Bend Aspect along the Arkansas River
in central Kansas (Wedel, 1947). These three cultural complexes are

CADDOAI~ AREA AI~D THE PLAII~S

55

closely related to one another and constitute a broad grouping of late
prehistoric peoples that occupied the Southern Plains.
The cultural identification of the Washita River peoples remains to
be proven by further study and excavation. I believe, however, that
all present evidence points to an identification as prehistoric Wichita.
The Wichita are an example of the Caddoan stock who are now"
residents of Oklahoma, located primarily in the region around Anadarko. Their history is not well known, but Harper (1953a, 1953b,
1953c) has been able to trace their movements throughout the last
250 years.
In 1834 the main villages were located at the mouth of Devilâs
Canyon in southwestern Oklahoma (Harper, 1953c). Prior to this
time, their villages were located in the area around Spanish Fort on
Red River, and they are known to have occupied this area during the
latter part of the 18th century, from 1757 to perhaps 1820 (Harper,
1953b). During the period prior to 1757, the Wichita were to be found
along the Arkansas River in Kay County, Oklahoma (Harper, 1953a).
Contact materials from these sites suggest an occupation for at least
the period from !700 to 1750 (Steen, 1953). Wedel (1947) has suggested identification of the Paint Greek culture (Great Bend Aspect)
with Quivira, or the historic Wichita location for the period around
1540. Prior to this date we must rely upon archeological evidence.
For historic times our present evidence suggests that the Wichita
were living in the Great Bend area of the Arkansas around 1540.
Apparently they gradually moved eastward, down the Arkansas River,
to be found living in what is now Kay County, Oklahoma, as early as
1700. As a result of shifting trade interests and Osage pressures, they
moved from their Arkansas River location in 1757 to settle near Spanish Fort on Red River. Although remaining in this area for an indefinite
period of time, they were located in southwestern Oklahoma by 1834.
By 1859 these villages were abandoned, and the tribe moved into the
Wichita Mountains area and ultimately settled on a reservation in the
vicinity of Anadarko, Oklahoma. Thus during a period of over 400
years the Wichita are known to have occupied the southern Plains
area from the Great Bend area of the Arkansas River in Kansas on the
north to the Red River valley on the south.
The archeological materials indicate that the Paint Greek (Great
Bend), Washita River, and Henrietta peoples are closely related. With
the identification of Paint Greek as Wichita, it seems reasonable to
identify the Washita River and Henrietta loci as prehistoric Wichita.
I therefore suggest that in late prehistoric times there was a movement

56

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

of peoples westward out of the Caddoan area, following the main river
valleys, such as Red, YVashita, Canadian, and Arkansas. These peoples
occupied the Plains area and became well adjusted to a Plains semihunting and semi-gardening economy, such as that represented by the
archeological manifestations known as Henrietta, Washita River, and
Paint Creek. In historic times these peoples were represented by the
Wichita or associated bands.
As to when this population began its westward movement out onto
the Plains, we need to look back at the Caddoan Area once again. The
Gibson period is not characterized by traits which we think of as typically Plains. The features which are so typical of the YVashita River
Focus are generally lacking. Nevertheless, some familiarity with and
knowledge of the Plains is manifest in flint specimens at Spiro and
other sites which were derived from quarries considerably westward
beyond the traditional limits of the Caddoan Area. On the other hand;
during the Fulton period, there is a number of traits which reflect
Plains culture--the diamond-shaped beveled flint knife, bison bones
and artifacts made of bison bone, such as the scapula hoe, and storage
pits. There are also similarities in projectile points and other artifact
typology. In short, the southern Plains cultures (Washita River, Henrietta, and Paint Creek) share more features with the Fulton Aspect
than with the Gibson Aspect. Yet the occasional Gibson trait, such as
potsherds and specific projectile point types, suggest a late Gibson association for at least some part of this Plains assemblage.
Thus it appears that a critical time period for Caddoan Area relationships with the Plains is the transitional period from Gibson to
Fulton times. This is, however, a poorly understood phase of Caddoan
Area prehistory. Yet it is perfectly clear that during this transitional
period something happens within the Caddoan Area that is not understood. Bell and Baerreis (1951), in their summary of Oklahoma archeology, comment as follows:
Â¯ . . features of the Gibson Aspect are in marked contrast to the Fulton
Aspect, which follows it. While the marked superiority in some technological processes, particularly ceramics, continues and perhaps is even
surpassed, in general the Fulton Aspect is marked by a decrease in cultural
complexity. The discovery of the factors responsible for this decline, at
least for this transition, constitutes one of the most interesting problems
of the Caddoan Area. The Fulton Aspect appears to be marked by the
decline in importance of the older ceremonial centers and the gradual
disappearance of both burial and temple mounds, with the latter persisting
for a longer period. As a positive contribution to this problem, it may be
noted that in Oklahoma there is a marked shrinkage in the Caddoan Area

during the Fulton Aspect period. Such cultures as the Neosho focus of
Upper Mississippi affiliation appear in the northeastern portion of the
state taking the place of an earlier Gibson Aspect occupation. Complexes
in the east-central portion of the state, such as the Fort Coffee, can no
longer be regarded as "pure" Caddoan units but show strong influences
from the Plains area .... It would appear that during Fulton Aspect
times the Caddoan Area on its northern frontier had been subjected to
increasing external pressure which resulted in both the decrease in actual
size occupied and the dilution of the culture through the acceptance of
many foreign innovations.

Orr (1952:251) also comments upon this transitional period.
"The great change between Gibson and Fulton is especially due to the
disappearance of the Gibson burial complex and associated ceremonialism.
At the same time new elements begin to come in mainly from the Plains
area: triangular proiectile points, scapula hoes, L-shaped pipes, perhaps
derived from some unit like the Great Bend Aspect of central Kansas.
However sharp the changes from Gibson to Fulton, they can be explained
as a rapid change of ceremonialism and the introduction of a relatively
few new items rather than by wholesale cultural replacement.

Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954: 171) consider the Haley Focus as
representing a late Gibson period occupation perhaps evolving directly
into Fulton times. They comment as follows:
Elsewhere in the Caddoan Area, the changes from Gibson to Fulton
Aspect units are on the whole quite radical, indicating not only a break
in continuity but perhaps a period of depopulation. Thus the continuities
from one Aspect to the other appear to have been centered about the
great bend of Red River in the Haley focus, and after a time of lapse in
the surrounding areas, new influences emanated from this center, establishing the Fulton Aspect units in the four states.

I would suggest, then, that the southern Plains groups, such as the
Henrietta, ~rashita River, and Great Bend manifestations, are prehistoric representatives of the Wichita group who split off from the
main Caddoan stock toward the end of Gibson times. The movement
of these peoples out onto the Plains at this time would not only be
compatible with their appearance on the southern Plains but would
help to explain the transition from Gibson to Fulton times within
the Caddoan Area. These people were obliged to adjust to a new way
of life on the Plains, thus sacrificing some of their earlier Gibson
traditions but replacing them with a Plains way of life which had
repercussions within the Caddoan Area homeland during Fulton times.
Manifestations such as the Sanders Focus (Krieger, 1946) may well

58

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

represent an example of one such Gibson group moving out into the
Plains and reflecting this transitional adjustment. Manifestations such
as the Turkey Bluff Focus (Lehmer, 1952) may represent a later
group with Fulton-Plains blending.
The reasons behind this movement out onto the Plains are not
especially clear at this time, although one or two possible factors can
be suggested. One of these would be the developing population pressures brought to bear upon the northern limits of the Caddoan Area
in northeastern Oklahoma. Perhaps other groups to the east were impinging upon the Caddoan Area and forcing an expansion westward.
Another factor, and one which I consider perhaps more important, is
the possible role occupied by the bison. Throughout the Gibson period,
bison bones are rare, often completely lacking, and obviously unimportant to the economy. On the other hand, during Fulton times or its
equivalent, the bison becomes more plentiful and more important. It
would seem quite possible that the bison was of primary importance
in attracting these peoples onto the Plains. The abundance of bison to
the west and increasing competition and population pressures in the
homelands area could well stimulate such a movement westward.
The approximate date for this westward expansion out of the Caddoan Area is not clear. The dating of the Gibson and Fulton aspects
remains unsettled and controversial at this time. Suhm, Krieger, and
:[elks (1954) suggest a range for the Gibson period from around A.D.
500 to 1200; for the Fulton period from around A.D. 1200 into historic
times, although most of the Fulton foci lacks historic materials. Utilizing only the youngest of conflicting radiocarbon dates for two Gibson
sites in Oklahoma, a span from A.D. 1150 to 1350 is suggested. Possible
dates for the Southern Plains cultures (Schmitt, 1950; Suhm et al.,
1954) range from A.D. 1300 to 1600. Thus the period around A.D. 1300
appears as a critical time, and I would suggest that the transition from
Gibson to Fulton times, as well as the accompanying westward movement onto the Plains, took place sometime between A.D. 1200 and
1400.*
Not only did the Wichita move westward out of the Caddoan Area
at this time, but I would also suggest that the related Caddoan tribes,
such as the Pawnee and Arikara, are derived from this locality. These
* We now have one radiocarbon date available from a house post at the Lacy site,
which is an example of the Washita River Focus. This date of 800 _ 150 (Specimen
M-820, Michigan Memorial Phoenix Proiect Radiocarbon Laboratory, University
of Michigan), giving a range from A.D. 1009 to 1309, suggests that my estimates
given above are perhaps a century too late (R. E. Bell, Feb. 1, 1961).

CADDOAN AREA AND THE PLAINS

later groups were derived from the Caddoan nuclear area centering
along the Arkansas River in eastern Oklahoma toward the end of Gibson times, roughly between A.D. 1200 and 1400.
As a summary working hypothesis. I would suggest that the Gibson
Aspect within the Caddoan Area was terminated by a movement of
Gibson peoples out onto the Plains, where they later became identified
as the historic Wichita, Pawnee, and Arikara. This westward movement probably took place sometime between A.D. 1200 and 1400. The
Pawnee and Arikara moved westward and northward ultimately to
occupy the Central and Northern Plains, whereas the Wichita re~
mained in the Southern Plains. This latter group maintained contact
with the Caddo groups remaining in the homeland, and these peoples
were responsible for the Fulton Aspect, which is prehistoric Caddo
proper. Differences which exist between the Pawnee and Arikara in
the Central and Northern Plains and the Wichita in the Southern
Plains may in part be a reflection of different sources from within the
Caddoan Area, the Pawnee-Arikara being derived from the nuclear
area centering along the Arkansas River in eastern Oklahoma, and the
Wichita being derived from the Red River valley in southeastern
Oklahoma.

Discussion
By David A. Baerreis
Robert E. Bellâs stimulating paper provides us with a broad interpretation of southern Plains history which in part differs sharply with
other studies of this area that rank among our early major contributions. Basically we are presented with a picture of steady movement
westward of Caddoan peoples, derived from a Gibson Aspect horizon,
and gradually modified in this western habitat. This split from the
main Gibson stock is postulated as taking place at the end of Gibson
times and culminating in the historic Wichita, Pawnee, and Arikara.
Among the representatives of this group, as prehistoric Wichita, is the
Henrietta Focus described by Alex D. Krieger in his 1946 monograph,

GADDOAN AREA AND TI-IE PLAINS

61

Culture Complexes and Chronology in Northern Texas. Krieger, however, states (and in italics in his report) that "... there is very little
in common between the Plains-like Henrietta Focus and the cultures
of the âCaddo areaâ to the east" (p. 156). He further denies flatly
archaeological support for the obvious linguistic linkage between these
tribal groups in stating:
From archaeological studies, at least, there appears to be practically no
support for a contention that Pawnee material culture can be traced to
"the old Caddoan habitat" to the south or southeast. I cannot recall a
single Pawnee trait which may be said to point specifically in this direction (p. 158).

We are perhaps dealing with a somewhat oversimplified position
in both instances. A major gap in Caddoan research lies in the question
of the origin of the complex and elaborate Gibson Aspect materials.
What was the nature of the ancestral or formative culture from which
it deve!oped? Is there a basic complex which spread over this region
from which both the eastern and western variants developed, and could
this earlier, and probably simpler, complex have been the source of
the more northerly Wichita, Pawnee, and Arikara prior to their assimilation of local Plains straits ?

As a non-Caddoan worker, I believe Dr. Bellâs paper offers a possible solution to certain Central Plains problems. The paper also poses
certain problems.
Workers in a particular area, failing to find a solution to their problems in their immediate region, tend to look to other areas for that
solution. In Nebraska this was a satisfactory arrangement so long as
field work lagged in nearby areas. However, with the acceleration of
research in these adjoining areas during the past ten years, we no
longer have totally unknown areas to which we can attribute our unsolved problems.
Strong in 1935 expressed his opinion that the Upper Republican
culture, as known in Nebraska, probably represented a prehistoric
stage in Pawnee development. He also regarded the materials designated as Lower Loup Focus as proto-historic Pawnee. The Nebraska
Culture, with a geographical distribution largely limited to the eastern third of Nebraska, was regarded as contemporaneous with the

62

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Upper Republican complex, with each definitely influencing the other.
Strong also suggested relationships for the rectangular earthlodge with
the prehistoric Caddoan culture of southwestern Arkansas.
Despite the relatively large amount of field research in the Central
Plains since 1935, I believe that most workers in the area will agree
that the picture has not greatly changed. The Nebraska area has not
produced direct evidence of cultural continuity between the Upper
Republican complex and the Lower Loup. It now seems somewhat more
likely that this sequence can be demonstrated from sites like the Arzberger (Spaulding, 1956) from the Missouri River Valley of South
Dakota. Sites to carry the Lower Loup complex into the historic Pawnee
period may also be lacking in the Nebraska area. It is difficult to extend
our Lower Loup sites much beyond 1700. On the other hand, sites of
the historic Pawnee variety are not known to date before about 1775.
This, of course, does not mean the rejection of Bellâs working hypothesis that the Gibson Aspect within the Caddoan area was terminated
by a movement of Gibson peoples out onto the Plains, where they later
became identified as the historic Wichita, Pawnee, and Arikara. Dr.
Bellâs suggested date for this movement of A.D. 1200 to 1400 does not
seem entirely out of line. However, it seems that some movements into
the Nebraska area may have taken place at an earlier period. Perhaps
the Nebraska Culture and even the Over Focus of South Dakota should
not be removed from consideration in this picture. In any event, it
seems likely that a series of Caddoan area influences over a considerable period of time may have occurred in the Central Plains area.

Dr. Bell has presented a plausible, simple hypothesis that well
accounts for many of the known facts of Plains-Caddoan relationships.
It is not the only hypothesis possible here, but it has some real advantages to recommend it. Not the least of these advantages is its simplic* Submitted with the permission of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

ity. Some may say it is too simple. I incline toward a simple explanation of cultural phenomena, though, whenever possible, and especially as a basic framework upon which to build. Another advantage
is the flexibility within this hypothesis, making it readily adaptable to
cultural movements in several directions at the same, or at varying,
time periods.
Certainly something dramatic took place in the Caddoan area around
the end of Gibson Aspect times, roughly in the period of A.D. Ii00-1300. A shift of some of the bands or other socio-political units of
Caddoans away from the homeland and into the Plains seems a reasonable explanation. It accounts for a partial depopulation of the Caddoan
area and provides an origin in both time and space for the Caddoan
speakers in the Plains after that time. It may also account for the
decline in ceremonialism at the end of Gibson Aspect times.
Assuming that this hypothesis is substantially correct, we would
seem to have Caddoan groups of three kinds to consider. (I) There
would be the groups of major size and importance that moved out
into the Plains, shifting about as Bell has indicated and eventually
becoming completely Plains people. One of these major groups (or
possibly more than one) became the Henrietta-Washita-Great BendWichita peoples that Bell traces rather clearly. Another group (or
groups) became the Lower Loup-Pawnee-Arikara peoples who moved
farthest from the Caddoan homeland, into the central, and later, the
northern Plains. (2) There would be the groups of minor size and
importance that participated to a lesser extent in the Gibson Aspect
break-up, stayed near the Caddoan homeland, and remained more
Caddoan than Plains oriented. One of these minor groups became the
Turkey Buff Focus, another became the Sanders Focus, still another the
Wylie Focus, the latter (Wylie Focus) having some sort of intimate
connection with the larger group that became the Henrietta Focus, as
is suggested by Wylie Focus pottery. (3) There would also be the
groups that remained in the Caddoan area and ultimately became the
Fulton Aspect peoples. These latter would, of course, account for by
far the majority of Caddoan peoples. Such shifting about and realignments would bring the Caddoan culture area into closer contact with
the Plains culture area and help to account for the Plains traits noted
in the Fulton Aspect Caddoan sites.
These cultural shifts may have taken place rather suddenly, even
explosively. If, however, any considerable time elapsed between the
earliest migrations and the latest, I should suggest that the Lower
Loup-Pawnee-Arikara group would have been the earliest to move.

64

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

I would base this suggestion on an age-area concept and on the need
for a maximum span of time for Middle Missouri cultural units (LaRoche, Fort Thompson, Stanley) to develop.
Bell suggests some possible reasons why some of these Caddoan
groups left home to become Plainsmen. I donât feel that these are very
strong reasons. Who would be the "other groups to the east" that would
be impinging on the Caddoan area, and what is the evidence? The importance of bison may be stronger, but there is some evidence that
woodland bison may well have been available to the Gibson Aspect
Caddoans without their having to go to the Plains for them.
Another reason may be suggested, and that is the elaborate Gibson
Aspect ceremonialism itself. A highly developed religious complex
may have been one of the major causes, rather than a result, of some of
the groups moving away from the homeland and of the later de-emphasis of ceremonialism within the Fulton Aspect. Church fights are nothing unusual in either primitive or civilized societies. If in a primitive
society the excessive rituals and ceremonies with their accompanying
heavy demands upon the people had failed to get the expected results,
or if the ceremonial leaders had become too domineering, a revolt may
well have been instigated. This would take the form of splinter groups
moving out of the homeland area, on the one hand, and disruption of
the !ong-established way of life of the groups that did not move away,
on the other. Some of the latter would tend to de-emphasize the ceremonials without actually breaking away from the homeland. Others
would maintain the old customs for a while, but gradually, as minority groups, they, too, would abandon the elaborate rituals. The splinter
groups that moved away may well have completely and at once abandoned the entire complex of offending ceremonialism. Other splinter
groups may have abandoned but parts of the complex.
This, of course, is difficult to demonstrate from archeological evidence, but it does provide an explanation for some of the archeologically and historically demonstrable facts. One way of getting at some
of these things--of tracing Caddoan relationships with the Plains as
well as with other areas--is by both intensive and extensive trait distribution studies. This is a resource that is yet to be exploited, except
for the ceramic studies that have been carried on, and it is a potential
source of answers to many of the Caddoan problems.

Relationships Between the Caddoan Area
and Texas1
EDWARD B. JELKS

This discussion will consider relations between the Caddoan Area
and certain archeological complexes to the west, southwest, and south
in Texas.
On the Archaic level there are three neighboring complexes which,
because of their geographical proximity, might be expected to show
some relationship with the Gaddoan Area. These are the Trinity Aspect
of north-central Texas, the Edwards Plateau Aspect of central and
west-central Texas, and an unnamed Archaic manifestation of the
southeastern Texas Gulf coast.
While Archaic components have been reported in the Caddoan Area,
none of them has been properly excavated, and consequently they are
known almost entirely from surface collections. Small campsites with
no visible evidence of permanent structures are typical. Sites tend to
be on the crests of hills overlooking stream valleys. Traits include
milling stones, pitted stones, grooved and polished stone axes, gouges,
and dart point types Gary, Yarbrough, Wells, Kent, and Ellis.
The Trinity Aspect is centered in the upper Trinity River area,
two loci, Carrollton and Elam, having been recognized. Several distinctive types of dart points are associated with the Trinity Aspect, including three principal dart point types of the Caddoan Area--Gary,
Ellis, and Yarbrough. Certain other types diagnostic of the Trinity
Aspect (types Carrollton and Elam are the most distinctive) seem to
be of local distribution, however, and are absent or extremely rare in
Caddoan Area sites. Other traits of the two areas are not shared; consequently the only apparent evidence of inter-area contact lies in the
sharing of the three dart point types.
This paper was presented at a symposium entitled "Itelationships between the
Caddoan Area and Neighboring Areas," which was part of the program of the Â£3rd
Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, held at the University
of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, May 1-3, 1958.

The Edwards Plateau Aspect of central and west-central Texas
features an impressive variety of chipped stone implements. Some
Edwards Plateau dart point types have been reported from postArchaic sites in the Caddoan area, and they may occur as trade items
in Archaic sites there as well. Caddoan Area artifacts, including arrow points, knives, and ceramics of both the Gibson and Fulton Aspects, have been found in central Texas sites; but in all cases these
trade items appear to have been associated with the later Central
Texas Aspect rather than with the Edwards Plateau Aspect. Several
of the sites involved contain components of both complexes: however,
and although it does not appear too likely at this time, the possibility
remains that there may have been active trade from the Caddoan Area
into central Texas on the Archaic level.
Manifestations of an Archaic occupation south of the Caddoan Area
along the Gulf coast were recognized by Joe Ben Wheat as a result of
excavations at the Addicks Reservoir near Houston. Because of insufficient data the complex has not yet been clearly defined, but it is apparent that considerable mixture of types obtains, some from central
Texas, some from the coast, and others from the Caddoan Area or related complexes in southwestern Louisiana.
In summary, it may be stated that, by and large, Archaic complexes
in north-central, central, and southeastern Texas are quite distinct
from the known complexes of the Caddoan Area. It is true that some
inter-areal contacts are indicated by sharing of certain dart point types
with north-central and southeastern Texas and by occasional trade
items which occur in all the complexes concerned. But there is certainly no evidence to suggest intensive contacts between the Caddoan Area and any of these neighboring Archaic complexes. Unfortunately, the Archaic of the Caddoan Area is little known, and it is to
be hoped that future research will clarify its present obscurity. Despite the incomplete data, however, it is clear that its affiliations lie for
the most part with what may be broadly termed the Southeastern
Archaic to the east.
Caddoan Area complexes of the Neo-American, or Neo-Indian,
Stage, like those of the Archaic, are largely oriented toward the southeast. Nonetheless, there are also strong ties between some of the Caddoan loci and certain complexes to the west, southwest, and south.
These complexes are the Henrietta Focus, the Central Texas Aspect,
and the Galveston Bay Focus.
The Henrietta Focus of north-central Texas is known from a series
of components which seem to represent temporary or semi-permanent

CADDOAÂ£â~ AREA AND TEXAS

67

habitation sites. Traits include hoes made from bison scapulae and
skulls; 4-edge beveled knives; small snub-nosed end-scrapers; a plaint
shell-tempered pottery (Nocona Plain) ; and arrow point types Hattell, Young, Gliffton, Fresno, Scallorn, and Perdiz. Trade items from
the Gaddoan Area (or possibly from some other related southeastern
area) include celts and Alba arrow points.
The Gentral Texas Aspect, as its name implies, is located in the
central portion of the state. Most components of this complex are small
campsites with no evidence of permanent structures. Some of the more
significant traits of the Central Texas Aspect are: a plain, bonetempered pottery (Doss Red Ware); snub-nosed end-scrapers; 4edge beveled knives; and arrow point types Scallorn, Eddy, Perdiz,
Gliffton, and Fresno. Trade material from the Caddoan Area occurs
in small quantity at many sites. Potsherds of Sanders, Alto, and
Frankston Focus types have been found in addition to Copena type
knives and Alba and Bonham arrow points. All excavated and reported
sites of the Gentral Texas Aspect lie along or west of the Balcones
Escarpment and therefore are at least 100 miles removed from the
Gaddoan Area proper. Many sites have been recorded, however, in
the strip of intervening territory between the Balcones Escarpment
and the Gaddoan Area, especially to the east and northeast of Waco.
Surface collections from these sites frequently contain more or less
equal quantities of Gaddoan and Gentral Texas Aspect artifact types,
and it is quite possible that very strong ties between central and eastern Texas may be revealed when some of these intermediate sites
have been excavated and studied.
To the south of the Caddoan Area, on the Texas Gulf coast, are
found archeological remains of what has been termed the Galveston
Bay Focus. This complex is distinguished by a unique kind of pottery
of Woodland shape, with conoidal or rounded base, some vessels being plain while others have simple incised designs around the rim.
These pottery forms have been described by Joe Ben Wheat under
the type names Goose Creek Plain and Goose Creek Incised. Chipped
stone traits of the Galveston Bay Focus include 4-edge alternately
beveled knives, small snub-nosed end-scrapers, and arrow point types
Perdiz, Scallorn, Gliffton, Fresno, and Alba. Like Henrietta Focus
and Gentral Texas Aspect sites, components of the Galveston Bay
Focus seem to represent temporary campsites with no permanent
houses or other structures. An occasional sherd of Gaddoan Area pottery occurs as trade material in components of the Galveston Bay
Focus, both Gibson and Fulton Aspect types being represented. The

68

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

Alba arrow points, which could have derived either from the Caddoan Area or from southwestern Louisiana, appear to be indigenous
rather than an indication of trade, however, since Alba is one of the
dominant types in Galveston Bay Focus sites.
The three Neo-American complexes described above certainly are
closely inter-related. All are characterized by temporary habitation
sites with small midden accumulations, and specific artifact traits are
shared between the three. All possess such generalized Plains Area
traits as small snub-nosed end-scrapers, 4-edge alternately beveled
knives, and triangular arrow points, and such specific traits as arrow
point types Scallorn, Perdiz, Cliffton, and Fresno. Yet each of the
complexes has its own pottery, distinct from that of the others, as well
as other peculiar, unshared traits. In order to make the picture complete, it should be pointed out that the Rockport Focus, which adjoins
the Galveston Bay Focus on the west, also shares the same generalized
Plains traits except for 4-edge alternately beveled knives and has the
same arrow point types. But it has its own distinctive pottery and
other unshared traits. The same assemblage of types, except arrow
point type Scallorn, extends westward from central Texas into the
Trans-Pecos area where, again, it occurs in association with traits
peculiar to that region.
In view of this general situation, one would appear to be on reasonably firm ground in hypothecating the diffusion of certain distinctive traits, at a definite period in time, over a large portion of Texas.
These traits are of a generalized Plains character and include 4-edge
alternately beveled knives, snub-nosed end-scrapers, and triangular arrow points. Diffusion, rather than replacement of the incumbent populations by invaders, must have been responsible, since distinctive local traits survive in all sub-areas from the underlying Archaic complexes into the subsequent period. The regional differences in pottery
types and other traits also suggest that local groups adopted the new
traits and added them to their cultural inventories. This development,
which swept over the entire central and much of the western portions
of the state, extended from Red River to the Gulf coast and westward
well beyond the Pecos River. Its impact was also felt along the western
edge of the southeastern pine belt, but it did not extend farther to the
east.
Turning finally to the Caddoan Area specifically, we find these
same generalized Plains traits appearing in Caddoan contexts. The
Sanders Focus, for example, has 4-edge alternately beveled knives
and snub-nosed end-scrapers, as well as bison scapula hoes similar to

CADDOAIXT AREA AND TEXAS

69

those of the I-Ienrietta Focus. Snub-nosed end-.scrapers are also reported from the Davis site, type site for the Alto Focus. Frankston
Focus, of the later Fulton Aspect, has 4-edge alternately beveled
knives, snub-nosed end-scrapers, and Perdiz arrow points, and most
other loci of the Fulton Aspect include triangular arrow points among
their traits. Plains accretions to the northern part of the Caddoan Area
probably derived from Plains groups in Oklahoma, or possibly Kansas.
But accretions to the Frankston Focus undoubtedly came from central Texas, since that is the nearest possible source not only for the
generalized Plains traits, but also for the Perdiz arrow points which
accompany them in the Frankston Focus. In addition, Frankston Focus
sherds are commonly found as trade items in central Texas Aspect
components. The Toyah Focus (the later of the two loci of the Central Texas Aspect) is thought to be ancestral to the historic Tonkawa
while the Frankston Focus is believed to be the prehistoric equivalent
of the Hasinai Caddo group. Four-edge beveled knives and snub-nosed
end-scrapers are common to both complexes, and Perdiz is the domiinant arrow point type of each. Of considerable interest, then, is
the recently discovered resemblance between the kinship terminology
of the Tonkawa and Hasinai Caddo groups of the post-contact period.
Rudulph C. Troike, who made a detailed linguistic study of the two kinship systems, has pointed out that the Tonkawa kinship terminology
is virtually identical to that of the Hasinai, although their languages
are otherwise dissimilar. He also presents documentary and linguistic
evidence to demonstrate rather conclusively that the adoption of the
I-lasinai terminology by the Tonkawa took place prior to the period
of European contact. This suggests that the Tonkawa and Hasinai
had more than a nodding acquaintanceship in prehistoric times~ a con~ecture which is supported by the archeology.
The development sequence in the Caddoan Area paralleled, in a
general sort of way, that of the three neighboring sub-areas under
consideration. In each case a rather distinctive local Archaic complex
preceded a subsequent Neo-American complex, with carryovers of specific types showing that the Archaic populations were at least partially ancestral to the Neo-American ones. In the Caddoan Area and
in the central Texas area two temporal divisions within the NeoAmerican stage have been recognized: the earlier Austin Focus and
the later Toyah Focus in central Texas, and the Gibson Aspect followed by the Fulton Aspect in the Caddoan Area. Similar divisions
may exist in the north-central and southeastern Texas sub-areas but,
if so, they have not yet been recognized. In the Gibson Aspect and

70

also in the Austin Focus the earliest stemmed arrow points have expanded or rectangular stems, while later arrow points in both areas
have contracting stems. Such parallel development may indicate that
contacts between the areas were established at a relatively early date.
As was pointed out previously, there is an intermediate zone between central Texas and the Caddoan Area where amalgamations of
traits from both areas are suspected. Farther north a similar situation
exists, exemplified by the Wylie, Fort Coffee, and Turkey Bluff foci,
each of which exhibits a more or less equal mixture of Plains and
Caddoan Area traits. Recent salvage excavations at McGee Bend
Reservoir, on the southern margin of the Caddoan Area, revealed several sites where Fulton Aspect material is mixed with artifacts similar
to those of the Galveston Bay Focus. Thus there is a curved strip of
territory skirting the western and southern edges of the Caddoan Area
where Caddoan Area traits are combined with traits of complexes to
the west and south.
In summary, it is clear that Caddoan Area peoples were influenced
prehistorically by neighboring peoples to the west and south. The intensity and duration of the influences are not yet fully known, a defect which may be remedied by additional research. It is suggested
that investigation of the "buffer" territory along the western and
southern margins of the Caddoan Area may hold much of the key data
for tracing these influences as well as for correlating the Caddoan Area
complexes culturally and chronologically with neighboring complexes
to the west and south. Strangely, little evidence of influences in the
other direction--that is, from the Caddoan Area into the neighboring areas-has been detected. Intensive, comprehensive studies of all
facets of the inter-areal relationships should do much to clarify the
picture.

Discussion
By T. N. Campbell
Jelksâ paper on cultural relationships between the Caddoan area
and adjoining areas in Texas is a straightforward, compact, clearly
expressed statement of the status of current knowledge, the main problems that can be recognized today, and what is essential for further
progress in this particular sector. I find little that I can disagree with,

CADDOAkN" AREA AND TEXAS

71

either in general or in specific detail. My remarks will be somewhat
random and of an amplifying nature.
Jelks ignores the evidence of Paleo-Indian occupation in the Caddoan area, which is obviously intentional and certainly reasonable
in view of the tenuous nature of the evidence and the fact that this
symposium is more concerned with the opposite end of the chronological column. However, it is of some interest to note that in local surface collections the most common early types of points are Clovis,
Scottsbluff, Plainview, and Meserve. Other types are stated to be rare
or absent. West and southwest of the Caddoan area Scottsbluff points
appear to be notably rare, a distributional detail that may be of some
significance in tracing movements of early hunting peoples in this
part of North America.
For the Archaic stage in the Caddoan area, particularly in the
southwestern quadrant, one can only deplore the lack of attention
which its apparently numerous components have received. As in
Mesoamerica and elsewhere, the later and more complicated cultures
have been too attractive. This neglect of the Archaic is understandable
but nevertheless regrettable. As Jelks points out, what is known of
the Archaic in the Caddoan area indicates a local distinctiveness that
contrasts with known Archaic units to the west and southwest in
Texas. It appears to be oriented toward the Archaic of the southeastern United States, but it occupies a marginal position with respect to
that region and should share more traits with adjacent areas to the
west than Jelks is able to enumerate. It may be that the western margin of the Caddoan area was a more sharply drawn cultural boundary
during the Archaic than it was in later times. It is also possible, of
course, that the paucity of shared traits is more apparent than real, reflecting imperfect knowledge of Archaic complexes in both areas.
I fear that we cannot expect any early solution to problems connected with the Archaic stage of the Caddoan and adjoining areas in
Texas. Ideally, for the Caddoan area specialist, the first order of business should be concentration on the nebulous East Texas Aspect, followed by definition of Archaic complexes immediately south and
southwest of the Caddoan area. It is pertinent here to note that the
proiectile point typology developed and used in the Texas field greatly
facilitates comparative studies of Archaic units.
Perhaps the most interesting problem in Jelksâ paper is the proper
interpretation of the so-called generalized Plains traits in western
Caddoan complexes and in the late prehistoric and early historic cultures of northern, central, and southern Texas. The most common

72

and widespread artifacts named by Jelks are triangular arrowpoints,
four-edged beveled knives, and small, well-made end-scrapers. These
appear to be related to hunting, butchering, and processing hides, particularly of the bison. 3elks discusses these traits in terms of their occurrence in roughly the eastern half of Texas and merely points to
their probable southern Plains derivation. Documenting the spread of
this cluster of Plains "traits is going to be difficult unless more cultural
units are defined in the southern Plains area itself. Except for certain
Paleo-Indian occupations and the relatively late Antelope Creek and
Optima loci of the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles, very little is
known about the southern High Plains. Between the Canadian River
of the upper Texas Panhandle and the Pecos River to the south virtually nothing is known of both the Archaic and later prehistoric
stages. We must have more excavation in northwestern Texas, eastern
New Mexico, and western Oklahoma before we can begin to talk intelligibly about the southwestward diffusion of specific Plains traits
into the central, southern, and lower eastern parts of Texas..lelks has
phrased for us an interesting problem for further investigation.
The Plains traits in the western Caddo loci are to some extent illuminated by certain ethnographic details concerning the historic
Caddo in Texas, particularly the Hasinai groups, who are linked with
the Allen Focus as well as the preceding Frankston Focus of the Caddoan area. According to Spanish sources, groups of Hasinai frequently
left their forested area to hunt bison in "the grasslands of central Texas.
One account states that the nearest bison were more than 40 leagues
from Hasinai territory. This, of course, is after the Hasinai obtained

horses from Europeans, but lengthy bison-hunting trips to the west
were probably a very old cultural feature in the western portion of
the Caddoan area. The records of the De Soto expedition refer to it. In
this we have a specific local mechanism that helps to explain movement of cultural traits from the Caddoan area to central Texas and
vice versa. For the most part these hunting trips must have been made
into open areas or areas occupied by friendly tribes, and possibly there
were sometimes joint bison-hunting expeditions that involved extended visits to friendly villages in central and north-central Texas.
If so, this may help to explain the Wylie Focus and other mixed assemblages just west of the Caddoan area.
For the late prehistoric and early prehistoric periods, relationships
between the Caddoan area and adjoining areas in Texas would be
much clarified by additional detailed ethnohistorical studies. The unpublished archival records, both Spanish and French, have not been

CADDOA1N AREA AND TEXAS

exhausted~ they have merely been sampled or skimmed, and principally by historians who are concerned primarily with relations between Europeans and Indians, or between one group of Europeans and
their Indian satellites and another similar association. Focusing attention upon each particular Indian group, its movements, and its
relationships with all neighboring groups throughout the early historical period will lead to the accumulation of a significant body of
ethnohistorical data, useful for interpreting archeological situations
and also useful for posing archeological problems. Kelleyâs studies of
the Jumano Indians exemplify this point. Jelks refers to Troikeâs study
of Caddo and Tonkawa kinship terms, which is another example of
how archeological objectives in the Caddoan area may be furthered
without benefit of excavation.
In conclusion, may I say that I heartily endorse Jelksâ suggestion
that the greatest need is for more excavation and publication in the
"buffer" territory along the western and southern margins of the
Caddo area. As so much of our excavation is now determined by the
placement of river basin reservoirs, perhaps we should ask our representatives in Congress to be more scientifically selective about the location of Federal dams on the rivers of eastern Texas.
