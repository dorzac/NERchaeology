ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of a proposed park site consisting of seven acres was
conducted by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on December 15, 2009 and
December 17, 2009 for the City of Flatonia under Antiquities Permit 5481. The City of
Flatonia also proposes to construct a 4000-foot hiking trail, but the area where the trail is to
be constructed was too disturbed to warrant any subsurface investigation. No evidence of
a prehistoric site was observed in the site of the proposed park. The lack of sandy soils
and proximity to a major stream are the probable reasons. According to local informants,
the project area had been used as pasture for cattle in the past. A small shed was
present, and it is reported to have been used for hay storage. Since it is not fifty years of
age, it was not recorded as a historic site. A wooden frame house stands in the southeast
corner of the project area. It was constructed in the early 20th century by the Southern
Pacific Railroad where it was used as a residence for railroad employees. It was moved to
the project area from its original location in the 1950s, and it continued to house railroad
employees. Its eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or for
consideration as a State Archeological Landmark is unknown at this time. It was recorded
with TARL as 41FY557. The city plans to maintain this structure as a storage facility. In
the northeast corner of the project area, a small scatter of modern trash was identified just
below the surface. BVRA recommends that construction be allowed to proceed as
planned. Copies of the final report will be made available to the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department (TPWD), the Texas State Library, and the City of Flatonia.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Flatonia has applied to the Recreation Grants Branch of the Texas
and Wildlife Department for assistance with two projects (city park and hiking trail) in the
city limits of the City of Flatonia (Figure 1). The projects were approved for award of
grant funds provided a cultural resource survey be performed, and the results approved
by the THC and the TWDB.
The park will be constructed within a seven-acre tract. The proposed
improvements consist of a parking lot, two restrooms, a xeriscape garden, walking trail,
skate park, and Frisbee golf course. According to city officials, the proposed
construction will not affect the subsurface below a depth of 18 inches. The upper
reaches of an unnamed tributary traverses the northern portion of the park site in an
east-west direction. This phase of the park construction will not involve the old
Southern Pacific Railroad station house (41FY557), and no grant funds will be utilized
for this site.
The Downtown Trails project will consist of the construction of approximately
4000 feet of trail paralleling the downtown area. Virtually all of the footprint of the
proposed trail is in TxDOT right-of-way and has been disturbed. The maximum depth
of disturbance needed to construct this trail is six inches. The upper reaches of an
unnamed tributary crosses the proposed trail in a north-south direction.
The project area is depicted on the 7.5’ USGS Flatonia topographic quadrangle
(2997-414). According to the engineering firm associated with this project, no federal
agency is involved.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following discussion was taken from the published soil survey for Fayette
County (Ressel and Brown 2004). Fayette County is located in the southeastern part of
central Texas. The county has a total area of 614,100 acres (960 square miles). Of
that total, about 4666 acres is water. The topography in most areas is nearly level to
undulating, but some areas are hilly and steep. Elevation in the county ranges from
200 to 500 feet above sea level.
Fayette County is in the Texas Claypan Area and Texas Blackland Prairie Major
Land Resource areas. Sandy soils are found in the Texas Claypan area, and these
soils were formed under post oak savannah and are mostly light in color. Clayey and
loamy soils are found in the Blackland Prairie. These soils were formed under grass
and are mostly dark. The Colorado River is the major drainage in the county.
Fayette County is hot during the summer months and cool in the winter when an
occasional surge of cold air causes a sharp drop in otherwise mild temperatures.
Rainfall is uniformly distributed throughout the year and peaks in the spring. Annual
total precipitation is normally adequate for cotton, feed grains, and small grains. In
winter, the average temperature is 54 degrees Fahrenheit, and the average daily
minimum temperature is 43 degrees. In summer, the average temperature is 83
degrees, and the average daily maximum temperature is 94 degrees. Total annual
precipitation is about 37 inches. Of this, 22 inches (60%) usually falls in April through
September.
There is only one soil type in the seven acre tract. According to the soil survey
for Fayette County (Ressel and Brown 2004:Sheet 45), this soil is described as Flatonia
loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (FaB). It is described in the soil survey as loamy soil on foot
slopes, low ridges, and upland stream divides. The surface layer consists of dark gray
loam from 0 to 4 inches, and the subsurface is clay from 4 inches to 33 inches. Below
that is silty clay and clay loam containing weakly cemented tuffaceous siltstone. This
soil type is used mainly for pasture.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
General
The project area is located in a region referred to in a statistical overview
compiled by Biesaart et al. (1985:Figure 15) as the Central Coastal Plain CulturalGeographic Region (Figure 3). When the overview was published in 1985, there
were 1067 recorded archaeological sites in the region. This figure represented
5.28% of the state. Of the 13 cultural-geographical regions in Texas, the Central
Coastal Plain was 10th in number of sites recorded. In 1985, there were only 65
recorded sites in Fayette County. This was 6.10% of the region and .32% of the
state. Site types were listed as Paleo-Indian (2), Archaic (19) and Late Prehistoric (6).
Some sites are mentioned as being disturbed due to erosion, construction, and soil
deflation. Four sites are mentioned as being destroyed. No sites had been
excavated, 48 had been tested by hand, and 14 had been surface collected. Hearths
and concentrations of burned rock are also noted.
According to Nightengale and Jackson (1983:6), Fayette County occupies a
transitional zone between east, coastal, and central Texas cultures with the most
influence being from the central part of the state. This statement is based on a
comparison of projectile point types and, in some cases, pottery with those found in
the Central Texas region. This thesis is presented in more detail in a report by
Duford W. Skelton (1977:13-16).
Previous Investigations in Fayette County
The amount of work conducted in Fayette County has increased considerably
in the 20 years since the statistical overview was published. The number of recorded
sites, for example, has increased from 65 to over 500. The earliest work in the area
was conducted by A. M. Wilson who surveyed portions of Bastrop, Fayette, and
Travis counties in June of 1930. An unpublished report is on file at TARL (Wilson
1930). The first systematic study was performed by J. P. Nunley (1963) in the 1960s,
when he surveyed the area to be inundated by the proposed Columbus Bend
Reservoir. Of the 65 prehistoric sites recorded in the county in 1985, one is
Paleoindian, 19 are Archaic, and six are Late Prehistoric. Two individual sites were
investigated in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These are the Frisch Auf! site
(41FY128) which produced the first association of Scallorn arrow points as grave
goods in Central Texas burials (Hester and Collins 1969) and the Meier site (41FY59)
which contained a Paleo-Indian component (Meier and Hester 1972). The Frisch
Auf! site, in contrast to other sites in the county, lies within the Colorado River
floodplain. Typically, sites in Fayette County were found during these studies to be
on the higher sand and gravel terraces above the floodplain. Although these higher
landforms protect sites from flooding, they are subject to sheet erosion and slope
wash, making them appear as surface sites due to a very thin layer of soil, often less
than six inches deep.

In the 1970s, archaeological activity in Fayette County increased as work was
done in conjunction with highway projects and transmission corridors. In the 1980s,
the most extensive survey was conducted over a 13,000 acre tract destined to
become a lignite mine (Nightengale and Jackson 1983). This study identified 56
prehistoric and 34 historic sites. Overall, the prehistoric sites were found to be
adjacent to creeks as only five sites were found on upland interfluves. In the
Cummins Creek Prospect area, 80% of the project area is overlain by Quaternary
fluviatile terrace deposits of gravels containing large quantities of chert and quartzite.
Two percent is overlain by the Manning Formation, which contains quantities of
knappable petrified wood. This tract is located on the divide between the Brazos and
Colorado rivers and, as such, would have been easily accessible to groups from both
basins as well as from the northwest and southeast (Nightengale and Jackson
1983:7). The Texas Highway Department continued work in the county in the 1980s
and into the 1990s when significance testing was conducted at two prehistoric sites
(41FY170 and 41FY509) (Price 1991).
Several studies involving historic sites have also been performed in the
county. These include:


Historic sites research at Biegel Settlement, a German community established
in 1838, by the Texas Archeological Survey as part of the Fayette Power
Project (Carter and Ragsdale 1976)



A study of historic sites located along Baylor Creek recorded during a span of
20 years as a result of projects conducted for the Lower Colorado River
Authority (Utley and Eling 1994). The sites were field checked and archival
research was carried out. The majority of sites are 19 th century farmsteads,
although two cemeteries were part of the study. Most of the houses have
been razed, and the remains are not considered significant.



Archaeological excavations at the Kreische Brewery (41FY128)

In addition to archaeological reports, historical accounts are documented in
local county histories. Those identified during this survey include Fayette County,
Her History and Her People (Lotto 1902); Chronicles of Fayette (Sinks 1975); Early
History of Fayette County, 1822-1865 (Weyand 1932); An Early History of Fayette
County (Weyand and Wade 1936); and Fayette County: Past and Present (Williams
1976).

METHODS
Background Check
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL on the campus of The
University of Texas at Austin were checked for the presence of previously recorded
archaeological sites in the project area and vicinity. The Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas was checked for previous surveys in the area. In addition, a thorough review of
the existing literature for Fayette County was conducted.
The Principal Investigator and three assistants conducted a 100% Pedestrian
Survey of the proposed park site and evaluated the proposed hiking trail. At the site of
the proposed park, the subsurface was examined by shovel tests. The soil throughout
the park site consisted of firm clay that could not be passed through the screen.
Therefore, it was broken apart by hand. The tests were dug in a grid pattern over the
seven acre tract (Figure 4). In all, twenty-nine shovel tests were excavated, and a
shovel test log was maintained (Appendix I). Shovel tests were excavated to depths of
20 to 50 centimeters despite the presence of very firm clay. The deepest tests were
dug in the northeast corner on the only high ground above the creek. Two structures
were observed in the project area. Only one (41FY577) is older than fifty years, and it
was photographed and plotted on the project area map (Figure 3).
In the northeast corner of the project area there is a small ridge of higher ground.
One shovel test produced a glass bottle, pieces of copper wire, and unidentified metal
fragments. Additional tests were excavated in order to delineate a historic site that
might be present. All cultural materials were found within the top ten centimeters, but
the tests were dug to 30 and 60 centimeters to ensure that no buried site was present.
Except for the bottle, the cultural materials are modern and are unidentifiable as to age.
They were described and returned to the shovel tests where they were found.
The footprint of the proposed hiking trail was visited and photographed. The
entire 4000 feet is in a developed area that has been greatly disturbed. The only water
source is a small gully that is depicted on the topographic quadrangle as the upper
reaches of an unnamed tributary. Therefore, no shovel tests were excavated. Figure 5
illustrates the disturbed condition of the site of the proposed hiking trail.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
No prehistoric sites were found in the seven acre tract. The lack of prehistoric
utilization of the project area is probably due to the fact that the entire area consists of
firm clay at the surface, and the nearest water source is a very minor stream that is best
described as ephemeral. According to the soil survey, the soil in this area contains
about four inches of loam on the surface; however, loamy soil was observed at only one
shovel test. The area consisted of a very firm clay throughout. At the time of this
survey, there was no water in the creek. Historic utilization of the project area prior to
acquisition by the City of Flationia was pasture for cattle. A barn and stock pen relating
to this activity had been removed from the landscape, and they were not present at the
time of this survey. Two small structures, believed to be tenant farmer houses, and a
shed were also present in the past, but they had also been demolished. They are
depicted on the topographic map that was prepared in 1965 and photorevised in 1981.
Two standing structures were present. One is a railroad station house that was
constructed for use by the Southern Pacific Railroad that was moved to this site from its
original location adjacent to the railroad siding in Janice west of Flatonia (Figure 6).
The house was constructed for the purpose of housing railroad employees who
controlled the switches at the siding. It was moved to its current location in the 1950s
by the railroad, where it continued to be used as housing for railroad employees. A
small addition was added, and the exterior was covered with asbestos siding. The
house was measured as 30 feet by 30 feet without the porch and an addition to the
back which is 6 feet by 12 feet. It has six rooms plus the addition. This house dates to
the early 20th century and meets the age requirements for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places. There are no plans by the City of Flatonia to remove this
structure. The only modifications planned are the removal of an addition to the back of
the house (circa 1930s), and the house will be used by the city for storage. This
structure was recorded at TARL as 41FY557. Former resident Elton Homesley shared
his knowledge of this house, and this appears in this report as Appendix II. The other
structure is a small wooden shed that was used by a previous landowner to store hay
for cattle. According to local informants, this shed was constructed following the
removal of the barn, and it was used for hay storage. It is less than fifty years of age.
The city plans to demolish it.
In the northeast corner of the project area, a small glass bottle that probably
dates to the early 20th century was recovered from a shovel test near the surface. In an
attempt to delineate a possible historic site seven additional tests were excavated. Of
the ten tests dug in the area, five contained cultural materials. A small clear glass bottle
and a whiteware sherd are the only items that can definitely be dated as older than fifty
years. Therefore, this area is believed to be a small trash scatter or dump.
A portion of the subsurface of the project area was disturbed due to the
placement of buried sewer lines in the southwest portion of the project area where two
travel trailers served as rental property. PVC pipe and a sewer main were observed in
the area. This disturbance was also noted through mixed soils at shovel tests 16 – 18.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed construction will not affect any prehistoric sites eligible for listing
on the National Register of Historic Properties or designation as a State Archeological
Landmark. Historic site 41FY557 will not be affected by the proposed construction.
Therefore, it is recommended that the City of Flatonia be allowed to proceed with
construction as planned including the removal of the shed. If construction plans change
that will incorporate areas not investigated under Antiquities Permit 5481, the THC and
TPWD must be notified. Should cultural materials be encountered during construction
that indicate the presence of a prehistoric or historic site not mentioned in this report, all
work in the area of the find must stop until the situation can be evaluated by the THC
and the TPWD. This project was conducted following the Minimum Survey Standards
defined by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division.

APPENDIX II
Brief History of Site 41FY557
My Mother and Dad (Willie E. Homesley) moved into the old Janice
Section House in 1943. I was four years old. The house was located two miles
west of Flatonia on the south side of the track (across the track from United
States Highway 90). It was about a mile east of what is now the Whistleville
Road. The Janice siding was several miles further west about where the railroad
crosses Peach Creek. We lived in the Janice Section house until 1948 (I finished
the 4th grade in Flatonia). Before us there was another Section Foreman living
there, and his name was Paul Zappe. After us, there was a foreman by the name
of Gilbert Huth that lived there. I'm not sure, but there might have been one more
foreman there before the Janice Section was abolished. The house was moved
into Flatonia by Woodrow Johnson who had purchased it from the railroad. He
located it at it's present site. This was about 1953 or 1954. This occurred when
the railroad was doing away with all the sections. I don't know exactly when it
was built, but it was built at the Janice site. It had four main rooms and a small
hallway that ran parallel to the kitchen. There was a big sleeping porch on the
back of the house that we used in the summers because it was so much cooler.
There was a small square room just off the back entrance that was originally
used as a company store to supply necessities to the Section Hands, and it was
run by the Section Foreman's wife. It wasn't functioning when we moved into the
house, and we eventually made that room into a bathroom (tub and washroom
only). The land the Janice Section house set on was approximately five acres. It
remained as railroad property at least until the demise of the Southern Pacific. I
don't know if the Union Pacific still retains title to that property. The Janice
Section property consisted of those five acres, The Section house, three track
laborers houses (two were two-room houses, and one was a three-room house)
there were two pit privys for all the families to use. And there was a barn of sorts,
mostly for the Section Foreman. The laborers were allowed to build pigpens,
raise pigs and chickens, and keep a garden. There was one well on the property
that had a hand pump. And the section house had gutters and two big
metal cisterns for water. Then there was a railroad tool house where the Section
Gang kept all the needed equipment as well as a motor car and push car. In
1946, my dad had the section House wired for electricity, and that was the only
added utility that we got. There was a big front porch that ran the whole length of
the house across the front and the steps were located about 20-25 feet from the
railroad tracks.
