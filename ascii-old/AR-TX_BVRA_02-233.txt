ABSTRACT
On April 8, 2010, Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) performed a
cultural resources survey on a 14.675-acre tract in central Angelina County
where Davis Penn Mortgage Company plans to construct an apartment complex
using funding from Housing and Urban Development. The heavily wooded
project area was investigated through a 100% Pedestrian Survey and shovel
testing. Twelve shovel tests revealed a sandy loam that varied in depth from 10
cm to 100 cm with much of the sandy loam over wet sandy clay. Much of the
area had been disturbed by logging activities. No archaeological sites were
found, and no artifacts were collected. BVRA recommends that construction be
allowed to proceed as planned. Copies of the report are on file at the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL),
Texas State Library, BVRA, and the client.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area consists of a 14.675-acre tract in central Angelina County
where the client intends to construct an apartment complex (Figure 1). The
apartments will provide housing for low-income individuals, and it will be funded
by Housing and Urban Development. The site is in a heavily wooded area that
slopes gradually to the east and is 270-300 feet above mean sea level. The
nearest major stream is Moccasin Creek, approximately 1000 meters to the
south. There is a minor drainage that passes through the extreme eastern edge
of project area. This tract is viewed as a low probability area for the presence of
a significant prehistoric site due to its distance to a major stream. The project
area is bounded on the east by Farm-to-Market Road 819, and the other
boundaries are within a larger 608-acre tract that is privately owned. The project
area is depicted on the Lufkin 7.5â€™ topographic quadrangle (3194-242) (Figure 2).
This is a Section 106 project that does not require an Antiquities Permit.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This project was performed in order to identify any cultural resources that
might be present within the proposed 14.675-acre tract. Davis Penn Mortgage of
Houston, Texas is the client. The map submitted to the THC contained a larger
608-acre tract that is drained by Moccasin Creek. The THC responded by
requesting an archaeological survey. However, the 14.675-acre project area is
viewed as an unlikely setting for a prehistoric site. Since the client did not have
time to wait for the THC to complete a second review, the decision was made to
proceed with an archaeological survey of the area discussed in this report. The
client retained BVRA to conduct the current archaeological survey. The Principal
Investigator was William E. Moore, and Phillip C. Bishop performed the field
survey. The project was carried out on April 8, 2010 and involved eight person
hours.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL and the Atlas were
checked for the presence of previously recorded archaeological sites and projects
in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting work
in Angelina County were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of
prehistoric and historic sites found in the area. Some of the major works utilized
are reports by Biesaart et al. (1985), Fields (1979), Ippolito (1983), and Kenmotsu
and Perttula (1993). The project area was investigated by a 100% Pedestrian
Survey and shovel tests within the footprint of the proposed apartment complex
(Figure 3). The twelve shovel tests were excavated at all four corners of the project
area, adjacent to the minor drainage, and randomly across the remainder of the
tract. Photographs of the project area were taken with a digital camera.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed no
sites have been recorded in the project area, and a professional archaeologist had
not previously examined the tract. No archaeological sites were found during the
course of this survey. At the time of this survey, the area was heavily wooded
(Figure 4), and the soils encountered consisted of sandy loam over wet sandy clay.
According to the published soil survey for Angelina County (Dolezel 1988), the
project area is located within the soil type described as Alazan very fine sandy
loam, 0 to 4 percent slopes, and this appears to be consistent with what was
observed in the field. This soil is described as a deep to nearly level gently sloping
soil on terraces and uplands throughout the county. The surface layer is sandy
loam to a depth of 16 inches, and the subsoil is loam and clay loam. This soil has a
high available water capacity and is somewhat poorly drained. Disturbance in the
inland portion of the project area observed consisted of stumps and cutover areas
that are evidence of past logging activities. Fireplugs and a culvert at the eastern
edge of the project area adjacent to the farm-to-market road are an indication of
disturbance at least 100 feet from the edge of the road that are probably associated
with utilities along the road. The absence of a prehistoric site is attributed to the
shallow, wet soils and distance (1000 meters) to the nearest major stream. The
stream in the project area was very small and insignificant (Figure 5).

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the absence of archaeological sites in the project area, it is
recommended that construction of the Crowne Ridge Apartments be allowed to
proceed as planned. It is always possible that archaeological sites are missed
during any archaeological survey. Should evidence of a prehistoric or historic
site in the project area be discovered during construction, all work in this area
should cease immediately until the Texas Historical Commission can evaluate
the situation. This survey was conducted according to the Minimum Survey
Standards as outlined by the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division.
