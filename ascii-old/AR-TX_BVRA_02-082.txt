INTRODUCTION
Duke Energy plans to install a 10" natural gas pipeline along an
approximate 22,000 foot route (25 acres) in southeastern Orange County, Texas
(Figure 1). Following a conversation between Stephen M. Swetish at CSC
Engineering and Environmental Services Consultants and William A. Martin at
the Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, it was decided that an
archaeology survey would be necessary for a small segment (1000 feet) of the
proposed pipeline route referred to as Section E. The remainder of the route was
either disturbed or viewed as being a low probability area for significant
archaeological sites. The project area is depicted on the 7.5' topographic
quadrangle, Mauriceville (Figure 2).
When a Notice-of-Intent (NOI) was submitted by CSC Engineering and
Environmental Consultants, Inc., the proposed pipeline was believed to follow a
different route to the south of and parallel to Little Cypress Bayou. This area was
viewed as a potential setting for the presence of significant archaeological sites.
However, when the field crew arrived they were shown a route by Mr. DeCardova
that crossed the bayou from north to south and traveled to the south away from
the creek. This is a much less likely area for archaeological sites.
The area surveyed begins at the north side of Little Cypress Bayou and a
modern canal, constructed to prevent flooding, and proceeds to the south to a
point where it turns to the west to end at a proposed meter pad adjacent to an
existing separator pad. The maximum width of the pipeline route will be 50 feet;
however, the actual ground disturbance or permanent easement will only affect
two feet; the remaining 48 feet is a temporary work area. The projected depth
along the pipeline route is four feet. A portion of this line will be bored beneath
the bayou. All natural vegetation and soils will be left in place during this
directional boring event in order to minimize the impact to the area.
CSC Engineering and Environmental Consultants, Inc. is the
environmental coordinator for this project, providing data relating to endangered
species, wetlands, and archaeological potential of the project area to Duke
Energy.
Adrianne Mraz, Research Assistant at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas was contacted regarding the presence of
previously recorded sites in the project area. After reviewing the Mauriceville
topographic quadrangle, she stated that no archaeological sites have been
recorded at TARL in the project area. There is no evidence that a previous
archaeological investigation has been done in or around the project area.

Overall, the project area is located in a region known to contain significant
archaeological sites. Because of this archaeological potential, a survey by
professional archaeologists was requested by the Texas Historical Commission.
Therefore, BVRA was retained by CSC Engineering and Environmental
Consultants, Inc. of Bryan, Texas to examine the proposed pipeline route for the
presence of significant archaeological sites. The project number assigned by
BVRA is 01-17. The field survey was conducted on August 24, 2001.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Early attempts at locating archaeological sites in the area were conducted
by pioneer archaeologists G. E. Arnold and A. T. Jackson (1940) of the
University of Texas. They travelled about the state and recorded sites, many of
which were considered significant and later revisited by professional
archaeologists. Arnold, for example, is credited with recording over 200 sites in
the general area that includes several East Texas counties.
One of the first major professional archaeological studies performed in the
area was the Toledo Bend Reservoir survey in adjacent Newton County (which
also includes other Texas counties and two Louisiana parishes). Several
investigators played a part in this endeavor. They are Scurlock and Davis
(1962), Scurlock (1964), McClurkan, Field and Woodall (1966), Woodall (1969),
Jensen (1968), Benham, Miller, and Sciscenti (1973). These projects included
both survey and excavation. In general, the prehistoric sites in the Toledo Bend
area are indicative of an Archaic occupation of the area at a early time with small
campsites scattered up and down the river and main tributaries followed by a
Late Prehistoric occupation, presumably Caddo or Caddo-influenced peoples).
Most of the sites for both the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods are situated on
rises or terraces above the floodplain of the Sabine River (Skinner and Cliff
1973:10).
Much of what is currently known concerning the archaeology of Orange
County has been derived from general studies involving broad areas such as that
performed by Lawrence Aten in his excellent book Indians of the Upper Texas
Coast (Aten 1983) and by specific studies usually concentrating on the Sabine
River area (McGuff, Paul R., and Wayne R. Roberson 1974). Testing and
mitigation of sites in the county appear to be rare; however, Espey, Huston &
Associates, Inc. carried out one such study at 41OR58 in 1991 (Rogers et al.). It
was recommended that this site be added to the National Register of Historic
Places (Rogers et al. 1991:55).
A review of the Archeological Bibliography for the Southeastern Region of
Texas (Moore 1989) revealed no major projects in Orange County prior to the
1991 investigation by Rogers et al. (1991). Professional studies are typically
small area projects, many of which failed to locate sites. A check of the
Abstracts in Texas Contract Archeology series published by the Texas Historical
Commission for the years 1987-1992 produced only three additional projects, all
small area surveys with no sites recorded except for a possible historic cemetery
on the Lamar University, Orange campus.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a records check was conducted for BVRA by
Adrianne Mraz, Research Assistant at TARL. Ms. Mraz checked the site files for
previously recorded sites in the project area. In addition, information pertaining
to previous archaeological work in the region was obtained from the library at
BVRA. The field survey crew relied on verbal instruction from Mark DeCardova
of Duke Energy and the 7.5' topographic map Mauriceville. The method utilized
to assess the pipeline route consisted of shovel tests and a surface inspection of
exposed areas. The field survey crew walked the entire route and dug shovel
tests at 100 foot intervals. The testing started at the south side of the bayou
where, according to Mr. DeCardova, the area will be disturbed. No disturbance
will occur on the creek banks due to boring. Since the project area does not
exceed 30 feet (9.15 meters) in width, parallel survey transects were not
necessary. A small raised area containing deeper soils was identified (Figure 3),
and two tests were dug at a closer interval (25 feet). Because of the presence of
large trees in this area it was believed to contain intact soils. The project area
depicting the approximate location of all shovel tests appears as Figure 3. No
soil survey was available for Orange County at the time of this survey.
The survey crew began at station number 226+00 on the south side of
Little Cypress Bayou and worked in a southwesterly direction. Between 226+00
and the Point-of-Intersection the route passes through an area that has been
disturbed through the construction of a power line right-of-way. At the time of the
survey, a three-pole power line was in place and paralleled this part of the project
area. At the Point-of-Intersection, the route turns to the west and passes through
a mixed hardwood forest. No creeks or other drainages were crossed along the
entire route surveyed.
All earth excavated through shovel testing was screened using 1/4"
hardware cloth, and a shovel test log was kept (Appendix I). Profiles of the
shovel tests were sketched in the field, and the tests were drawn on a project
area map (Figure 3). In all, nine tests were excavated.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The records check at TARL revealed no previously recorded
archaeological sites in the project area. No cultural materials were found in
either of the nine shovel tests or observed in eroded or pushed areas along the
disturbed portion of the right-of-way. It is believed that this area is too far from
any creeks or other water sources to be considered anything but a low probability
area for the presence of significant archaeological sites.
BVRA recommends that Duke Energy be allowed to proceed with
construction of the pipeline as planned. It is the opinion of BVRA that no
significant archaeological sites were missed during the examination of the 1000
foot proposed pipeline route. Should, however, cultural materials be exposed
during the construction of the pipeline, all work should cease until the situation
can be evaluated by the Texas Historical Commission in consultation with Duke
Energy Field Services, Inc. and BVRA.
