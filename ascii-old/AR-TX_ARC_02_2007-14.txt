ABSTRACT
In late March 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted a pedestrian
archaeological survey of approximately two miles of the proposed
Western Boulevard Corridor to be constructed in the upland Fort Worth
Prairie. The proposed road begins south of US 380 and runs south to
Airport Road. The survey was done for Teague, Nall and Perkins which is
doing the environmental permitting for the City of Denton. Since the City
of Denton is a political entity of Texas, Texas Antiquities Permit Number
4459 was issued for the archaeological survey.
One site, 41DN548, a historic homestead, was recorded but was
considered ineligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places because it has been modified and it is in such poor shape. Also an
isolated occurrence, a historic pump, was recorded. Otherwise no cultural
materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface or found in
20 shovel tests.
Based upon the results of the survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends
that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted. However, if
buried cultural materials are encountered, work should stop immediately
in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be notified. Work should not continue until
consultations with the Texas Historical Commission have been concluded.

INTRODUCTION

The City of Denton intends to construct Western Boulevard which is approximately 2
miles long and about 200 feet wide. The proposed route begins south of US 380
approximately 4,200 feet of the intersection of US 380 and IH 35W, runs south and
terminates about 1,100 feet west of Corbin Road on the north side of Airport Road
(Figure 1). During late March, 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed road right-of-way. The survey was done
for Teague, Nall and Perkins which is doing the environmental permitting for the City of
Denton.
Since Denton is a political entity of Texas, an antiquities permit was required and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission issued Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4459 for the archaeological survey.
The scope of the project included a records review, an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey and the preparation of a summary report. This report was written in
accordance with the report guidelines adopted by the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission and developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (ND). The
following report presents a brief description of the natural setting of the project area. This
is followed by a short discussion about Denton County archaeology and history. The
research design and methodology follow. The results of the field survey are presented in
the major section of the report. Recommendations conclude the text. A list of references
cited ends the report.

NATURAL SETTING
Denton County is located in North Central Texas. It is bisected by the sandy soil of the
Eastern Cross Timbers. The western portion of the county is covered by the soil of the
Fort Worth Prairie in which the study area lies and the eastern part consists of the rich,
black soil of the Blackland Prairie. The county is drained by the Elm Fork of the Trinity
River and several major creeks. Average rainfall is approximately 33 inches while the
temperature average ranges from 34 degrees in January to a maximum of 96 degrees in
July (Odom 2003).
The Lower Cretaceous-aged undifferentiated PawPaw Formation, Weno Limestone and
Denton Clay underlie the once natural prairie environment (Bureau of Economic Geology
1967). Bedrock decomposition and pedogenesis in the study area have resulted in
creation of the soil associations known as the Sanger-Somervell which consists of gently
sloping to moderately steep upland loams and clays (Ford and Pauls 1980: General Soil
Map).
The upland surface has been cleared of most trees and supports Bermuda and other
grasses that have been invaded by mesquites. The edge of the upland and the valley
support numerous young and old trees including bois d’arc, American elm, cedar elm,
hackberry, honey locust along with various weeds and masses of greenbriars. According
to various authors, including Lynott (1979), the prairie once supported a cover of tall
grasses and was inhabited by now absent herbivores including bison and antelope.
Certainly, deer inhabited the floodplain forests, but this environment is not present in the
survey area.
Paleoenvironmental change is not well documented, but it is summarized by Prikryl
(1993:192-193). Prior to 12,000 B.C., the climate of north central Texas was cooler and
moister than at present. Between 12,000 and 8,000 B.C., the climate became warmer and
this continued to the present, but with brief mesic periods. It is suggested that the
presence of high grass pollen and low arboreal pollen between 5550 and 1050 B.C. show
a drying with a return of arboreal pollen after 1050 B.C. The later change is similar to
today’s environment. High grass pollen also occurs at approximately A.D. 450 and from
A.D. 1550 to 1650, and this also indicates drier periods. The presence of paleosols
between A.D. 1 and 1000 suggest an increase in moisture during this period with a return
to drier conditions after A.D. 1000.

CULTURAL HISTORY
The history and prehistory of Denton County are summarized in several reports prepared
by the University of North Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990; Brown and Lebo 1991; Ferring
and Yates 1998). Prehistoric Native American settlement in Denton County began at least
10,000 years ago as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points (Crook
and Harris 1957) at the Lewisville site and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring 2001).
Moreover, artifact collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff and other
Paleo-Indian points from the surface of sites in the region. The presence of exotic, i.e.,
non-local, lithic resources indicates that these early people traveled a territory where
higher quality lithics were available or were involved in a system of raw material trading.
These early people hunted now-extinct large game, but probably also foraged off the
land.
The subsequent period, the Archaic, lasted from 7,000 to 6,000 B.C. to possibly as late as
A.D. 700 to 800. The Archaic peoples lived throughout the counties but particularly
along the major and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather native
foods. Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are common artifacts
found on Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued using exotic cherts for
dart points, but as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of local lithics for chipped
stone tools. These local materials are described as Uvalde Gravels (Menzer and Slaughter
1971). Large Archaic sites are generally located on terraces or ridges that overlook the
Elm Fork of the Trinity. Smaller lithic scatters have been recorded in upland areas
throughout the county. These sites appear to be Archaic in age, but none have been
thoroughly studied.
Various authors, including Bruseth and Martin (1987) and Peter and McGregor (1988),
have attempted to create a chronology for North Central Texas. The most commonly used
chronology was established by Prikryl (1990) which divides the Late Prehistoric, the time
from the use of the bow and pottery to the Historic Indian, into two periods: Late
Prehistoric I (A.D. 700 to 1200) and Late Prehistoric II (A.D. 1200 to 1700).
During Late Prehistoric I times, pottery appears in sites excavated at Lake Lewisville
(Ferring and Yates 1998), but, interestingly, very little ceramics were recovered from
excavations at Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997). Arrowheads appear about this
same time and apparently the bow and arrow had been added to the hunting tools. From
A.D. 1000 to 1300, pottery appears in North Central Texas that has similarities to
Caddoan pottery as well as Caddoan and Jornada Mogollon ceramics occur on sites in
North Central Texas (Prikryl and Perttula 1995). In addition houses were found at the
Cobb-Pool site, 41DL148, (Peter and McGregor 1988:140) and at Bird Point Island
(Bruseth and Martin 1987:182). Prikryl (1990:77) mentions the use of corn for food in
North Central Texas during this time and Todd (1999) suggests that the presence of
mussel shell hoes in North Central Texas indicates some form of farming.

During Late Prehistoric II times, it is believed that the climate was drier. Possibly bison
may have been utilized more than in Late Prehistoric I times (Dillehay 1974). The
presence of bison-scapula hoes, especially in northern North Central Texas, suggests an
increase in horticulture or, at least, its presence. This concept is supported by the
presence of sites along sandy terraces instead of the floodplain area where Late
Prehistoric I sites are found. There is a marked Plains influence in North Central Texas
during this time also Prikryl 1990:80).
At the end of the Late Prehistoric periods, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of the North Central Texas area. Along the Red River in Montague and
Cooke Counties and across Red River in Oklahoma, there is both archaeological and
ethnographic evidence of historic Taovayas, Wichitas and Yscanis Indians (Bell, Jelks
and Newcomb 1967; John 1992:204; Lorrain 1969) Since the Spanish could not subdue
the Indians, they made them their allies with promises of help against the Osage.
There is tantalizing evidence found on the Trinity River in Dallas County of a possible
visit by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto (Bruseth 1992). Artifacts found consist of a
chain-mail gauntlet, a halberd and a spur. Current research, however, seems to indicate
that Anglo settlers were the first non-Indians to settle in North Central Texas.
The first established European settlement in Denton County began before the mid-1800
with the establishment of the Peter’s Colony after Texas independence. These early
settlers were farmers who selected bottomland along the Elm Fork of the Trinity (Bridges
1978). Commercial farming was not important until after the Civil War, and the early
settlers were essentially self-sufficient. Besides domestic plants and animals, wild
animals and plants were commonly consumed. Denton became the county seat in 1856.
By 1875, cotton, corn, and wheat were the main cash crops. Up to half of these crops
were grown by tenant farmers who either paid rent to the land owner for their house,
tools, and seed or by tenants who gave the landowner a third of the grain and a quarter of
the cotton or other cash crops. By the turn of the century, all of the major communities
had been established and some had passed away.
Previous Investigations
A check of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2007) and the 1918 Denton County Soils
map (Carter and Beck 1918) failed to discover any archaeological sites along the
proposed road route or adjacent to it. However, three residential structures along the route
are shown on the 1936 General Highway Map of Denton County (Texas State Highway
Department 1936). These same structures are plotted on the 1960 Denton West, Texas
7.5’ USGS map.
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2007), site 41DN525 was recorded
west of IH 35W between the frontage road and the railroad prior to the highway
expansion. The site consisted of a historic trash scatter consisting of glass, metal, animal
bone and old bottle tops that might be Bakelite screw caps.

AR Consultants, Inc. has conducted several archaeological surveys in the general area. A
pipeline route was surveyed about 1.5 miles southwest of the proposed Western
Boulevard Corridor (Trask 2001). No cultural materials were seen on the ground surface
or found in four shovel tests. Archaeological testing was done on both banks of Hickory
Creek for a pipeline route west of and adjacent to C. Wolfe Road about 2.7 miles west of
the study area (Todd 2002). The shovel tests were culturally sterile. Another pipeline
route was investigated about a mile west of the proposed road corridor that crosses the
Dry Fork and Jim Christal Road. No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on
the ground surface or found in 11 shovel tests along the Dry Fork’s channel. A water
pipeline route along Milam Creek was investigated by AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd 2005)
about 4.5 miles northeast of the study area. No cultural materials older than 50 years were
found on the ground or in 61 shovel tests along the creek. However, four prehistoric
archaeological sites were discovered during the archaeological survey of an
approximately 500 acre development track about 1.4 miles slightly southwest of the
proposed road corridor (Jennings and Todd 2006). The four archaeological sites, two
shell middens and two extensive rock/hearth features, were discovered along Hickory
Creek and a minor tributary to it. No prehistoric or historic sites were found in the
adjacent uplands.
The gist of these archaeological surveys was that prehistoric archaeological sites were
found adjacent to perennial water such as springs. Since site 41DN525 was recorded
adjacent to IH 35W; historic sites may be present adjacent to roadways.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The research design for this survey focused on two questions. The first dealt with the
distribution of prehistoric sites, while the second dealt with a general question that asks,
“Where are sites located?”
Based primarily on the previously mentioned surveys in the vicinity of the study area, it
has been proposed that occupation in the uplands away from the major drainages was
primarily for the purpose of hunting. The sites were expected to be small in area [less
than 100 meters square], to have a limited tool kit, and be shallowly buried [this is a
degrading environment]. Sites were also expected to be tied to reliable water resources,
and as a result it was expected that no prehistoric sites would be found in the upland
away from a perennial water supply. Historic sites might be present though because the
study area is adjacent to transportation routes.
An even more basic, research problem also guided the survey; simply stated the question
asks “How did past people use the land, and what record of this use did they leave
behind?” Most frequently, limited-area and linear surveys of this type gather information
in response to this more open-ended research question, which guides almost all
archaeological surveys.
Methodology
The proposed road right-of-way is approximately 2 miles long and about 200 feet wide.
The archaeologists surveyed the staked route in transects spaced approximately 20 m
apart.
Shovel testing was done on an as-needed basis as suggested by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (2002). However, site 41DN548 was defined by 6 shovel tests and archival
research was done as suggested by Denton (1999). Shovel tests were excavated to
approximately 35 cm below the surface. The loamy matrices were screened but the clay
matrices were not. The pit walls also were inspected. Notes about the topography,
vegetation and soils were made and photographs were taken.
Backhoe trenching was not done due to the absence of alluvial material to bury cultural
deposits.

RESULTS
This portion of the report describes the survey. Shovel tests are discussed generally in the
text. Specific information can be found in Table 1 and shovel test locations are plotted on
Figure 1. The survey route crosses gently rolling terrain.
Survey began at US 380 and went south. From US 380 to Jim Christal Road, the
proposed road corridor runs through an unimproved pasture (Figure 2). Understory
vegetation includes prickly pear, saw greenbriar, grape vine, bunch grass, bermuda grass
and native grasses. Trees consist of mesquite and hackberry. The trees are fairly young
with 2 to 3 inch diameter trunks. Ground visibility was about 20 percent but occasionally
was 60 percent. Eye-height visibility was excellent.

No shovel tests were excavated in the portion of the road right-of-way from US 380 to
the first fence due to the disturbance from construction of the soil. The proposed road
runs between Friendship Church and a gated area south of US 380. A gas pipeline runs
east-west across the proposed road right-of-way.

The first shovel test (hereafter ST) was excavated approximately 200 m south of US 380
and encountered 37 cm of culturally sterile loamy clay. Shovel test 2 was dug east of the
slight knoll the proposed road route bends around and uncovered 35 cm of culturally
sterile clay. The next shovel test (ST 3) was placed on a slight rise and encountered 17
cm of clay overlying clay subsoil that contained limestone gravel, and ST 4 was
excavated on the north side and close to the bottom the knoll on which site 41DN548 is
located. The shovel test uncovered the same soils as ST 3 but the contact was at 21 cm
and it was terminated at 39 cm below the ground surface. The four shovel tests were
culturally sterile and no cultural materials were seen on the ground surface from US 380
to site 41DN548. The site is discussed in detail below. No shovel tests were excavated
from the site to Jim Christal Road due to disturbance and good ground visibility. The
proposed road route parallels an existing asphalt driveway in this area.
From Jim Christal Road south to Airport Road, the proposed route continues through
unimproved pasture. The vegetation is similar to the previous surveyed area except that
cedars, American elm and winged elm are present. The ground visibility was much better,
ranging from 40 to 100 percent (Figure 3) in places. An intermittent tributary to Dry Fork
will be crossed by the proposed road route. The drainage is approximately 1.5 m deep
and 3 m wide. No buried cultural deposits were seen in the vertical banks (Figure 4). The
proposed route parallels existing dirt two-track roads in places and the area immediately
north of Airport Road has been bulldozed. The road and bulldozed area allowed for
excellent ground visibility.

Shovel test 5 was placed on an elevation overlooking the intermittent tributary and
encountered 18 cm of clay overlying clay that contained sandstone gravel to 35+ cm
below the ground surface. Shovel 6 was placed on the edge of a bench and encountered
37+ cm of clay and ST 7 was placed in a similar location further south and uncovered 15
cm of loamy clay containing sandstone gravel that overlaid impenetrable gravel. The
shovel tests were culturally sterile.
Part of a water pump motor was found approximately 400 m south of Jim Christal Road.
It was designated as Isolated Occurrence (IO) 1 and is described below.
Approximately 75 m north of Airport Road, a wooden shed and two concrete water
troughs/tanks were found. The troughs were approximate 8’11” in diameter, the walls
were 51/2 inches thick and 2 feet high. One of the water troughs had “John O.
Underwood 02-01-1942” engraved on the top of the concrete. A possible house site was
found, but it had been bulldozed and another possible house structure about 50 m north of
the concrete trough was found, but it also had been bulldozed. No historic features except
for the concrete troughs, no signature plants or house foundations were found.
Despite the presence of cultural materials older than 50 years, no historic or prehistoric
archaeological sites were found and no cultural materials were found in the shovel tests
from Jim Christal Road to Airport Road.

Isolated occurrence (IO) 1
The part of water pump motor is mounted on a concrete block (Figure 5) on a ridge that
that has been bulldozed. “Monitor” is engraved on the north side and “Baker Mfg Co”
and “Evansville, Wisc” is on the south side of the pump motor. An internet search
revealed that the Monitor Division of Baker Manufacturing Company began business in
1875 and that large cylindrical pumps were manufactured in 1890. The date when they
were discontinued was not supplied (Baker Manufacturing 2007).
Except for a few cobalt and porcelain pieces found in the vicinity of the pump motor, the
only artifact of any possible antiquity was a red toy wagon with “Western Flyer Rocket”
painted on the side which was found about 300 feet northwest of the pump motor. A
records search failed to provide any information. However, a 1960s model of Western
Flyer Rocket was for sale on EBay and it was manufactured by Western Auto. The
writing on the side of the 1960s wagon is similar to that of the one found at IO 1.
Two residences were plotted on the 1960 USGS map in the area. An intensive survey of
the adjacent area failed to discover any house foundations, signature plants or historic
features. However, the remnants of a house constructed after 1973, the last date the
USGS map was updated, that had been bulldozed (Figure 6) was found about 50 m
northwest of the pump motor. Machine made brick fragments and floor tile fragments
were found in the vicinity of the pump motor that were similar to those in the house
debris push pile. It appears that the historic residences were constructed, removed,

probably for farming practices, and then a modern residence was constructed, which in
turn was bulldozed. Curiously, the pump motor was not disturbed. Shovel tests were not
excavated in the vicinity of IO 1 due to the excellent ground visibility and previous
bulldozing.
Although not recorded as a site, archival research was done which was extremely
difficult. The motor pump is situated in the John Scott Survey Certificate #2029, Abstract
Number 1222, Patent 415, Volume 11, dated October 12, 1886 and the John Bacon
Survey, Abstract Number 1541, Patent 227, Volume 1, dated October 20, 1861. The next
transaction found was in 1985 when it was determined that the property was purchased
from J. Newton Rayzor in 1965 from Ray Crouch (Volume 530, November 15, p. 579).
The record trail became difficult to trace since the study area was one of thirty-one
parcels purchased by Mr. Rayzor (Cornerstone Heritage Preservation Services 2007:2).
Site 41DN548
After the archaeological survey, the Atkinson-Davis site (41DN548) was revisited
(Figure 7). The site consists of a farmstead that includes a frame house, a windmill, a
water tank and storm shelter (Figure 8). The house is a National Folk-Pyramidal Family
Style (McAlester, Virginia and Lee McAlester 1984). This style was used between 1905
and 1930. The building is a one story wood frame house with a cross gable roof and the
exterior was covered with rock at a later time as shown in Figure 9. The windows are one

over one single pane double hung. A hipped roof extension is present on the east and
west facades and the residence contains three brick chimneys. However, the roof is
missing. The entrance may have had a double door or wide door with sidelights
(Cornerstone Heritage Preservation Series 2007:1). The dimensions of the house are
approximately 40 feet east-west and 29 feet north-south. Six rooms constitute the house.
The house is impressive when seen from a distance. However, at close distance, the
deterioration is noticeable (Figure 10). Today, the wooden floor of the deteriorated house
is covered with cow manure (Figure 11).
Modifications have been made to the houses over time. Paneling is adjacent to 1x12 inch
boards that have been added to the house since it was constructed (Figure 12). The
modification is clearly shown by the boards constructed over the eastern chimney and the
plugging of a chimney flue as shown in Figure 13. Further modification is the modern
commode which is in the central back room (Figure 14) and the various type and color of
boards (Figure 15) used in reconstructing the back room. The outside of the house also
has been modified. Various boards have been used to repair the walls below the roof
(Figure 16). Newer shingles (white) have been laid over the older shingles (green) over
most of the house. The difference in the shingles is shown in Figure 17 which is on the
east side of the house. A hole in the roof eave is in the same area (Figure 18).
Interestingly, a long slit hole (Figure 19) was present in each of the walls. The purpose is
unknown to the author.

To determine if buried cultural materials were present, six shovel tests (8 through 13)
were excavated around the boundaries of the site. All the shovel tests encountered loamy
clay that ranged from 9 to 11 cm overlying clay containing limestone fragments that
extended from 13 to 16+ cm below the ground surface. All of the shovel tests were
culturally sterile.
Numerous bricks are adjacent to the house and were used in constructing the chimneys.
The dominant (85 to 90 percent) brick used was Excelsior. This is the brick with a
diamond in the center of the panel. Other brick types include Ferris Light Pink, Acme
Brick Co. La Perla A and Palmer. Three companies, Alabama Clay Products, Pacific
Clay Products and Seaboard Refactories Company, made Excelsior Brick from 1927 to
1942 (Gurcke 1987:232).
Although the type Ferris Light Pink was not dated, Ferris bricks were made between
1901 and 1926 (Gurcke 1987:234). Only one brick was found. The other brick type,
Acme Brick Co, La Perla A, was made from 1935-1942 (Gurcke 1987:194). The Palmer
type brick, of which only one was found, was not listed.
The windmill has AERMOTOR Chicago imprinted on it. The windmill motor is encased
which means that it is self-oiling. The Aermotor self-oiling motor was used at least by
1915 (Day 1979:215).
The concrete storm/root cellar is interesting (Figure 20). Metal pipes and other forms of
metal can be seen eroding out of the concrete. It appears that metal was used as filler
within the concrete and served no other function. The cellar had porcelain pipes for air
holes. Another house may have existed prior to the one that is standing today. The cellar
is approximately 225 feet from the present house. This seems a little far to get to a cellar
during a storm.
In order to determine if a house had been present in the past, seven shovel tests (14
through 20) were excavated around the cellar and their locations are shown on Figure 18.
The shovel tests encountered culturally sterile sandy loam overlying impenetrable gravel
at depths ranging from 7 to 35 cm below the ground surface.
Archival research indicates that the farmstead was originally part of the William Bryan
Survey, Certificate 106 Abstract 148, Patent 851 and dated July 21, 1856, Volume A (2),
page 271 of the Denton County Records. Mr. C. C. Bell and his wife, Alvira, purchased
the property in 1878 (Volume 1, January 5, 1878, pp. 39-44) and then sold it to Mr. J. B.
Watkins in 1896 (Volume 56, January 31, 1896, pp. 517-520). On August 1, 1898, Mr. A.
D. Turner purchased the land from the J. B. Watkins Land Mortgage Company (Volume
66, pp. 316-317) and Mr. Turner sold the land to C. Richey in 1911 (Volume 119, May 3,
1911, pp. 398). The land was then purchased by E. F. Davis in 1914 (Volume 137,
December 24, 1914, p. 396). The property was deeded to Diane Davis and Jack Atkinson
as well as Wallace E. and Mary V. Davis, Jr. on May 13, 1970 as stated in Volume 612,
p. 430 (Cornerstone Heritage Preservation Series 2007:1-2). Unfortunately no
information was available when the house or houses were constructed.

Conclusions
The absence of prehistoric sites is attributed to the absence of perennial water, the low
biotic diversity and the lack of knappable lithic resources. Although historic residences
were present in the past, they have been removed except for the Atkinson-Davis
(41DN548) site. The house site is not considered ineligible for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places or as a Texas State Archaeological Landmark due to its
dilapidated condition due to its use as a cow barn, significant features are missing, its
structural integrity has been compromised and it has been modified over time. Due to the
deteriorated condition of the house, to restore it would be a reconstruction and not a
rehabilitation or restoration. In addition, due to its deteriorated condition, the house can
not be moved.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are
present within the proposed road corridor and none were. Based upon the results of this
archaeological survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resources
are unwarranted in the study area and asks the Texas Historical Commission to agree
with our findings. If buried cultural materials are discovered during the construction of
the roadway, work should stop in that area immediately and the Archeology Division of
the Texas Historical Commission should be notified immediately. Work should not
continue until the necessary investigations have been carried out after consultations have
been completed.
