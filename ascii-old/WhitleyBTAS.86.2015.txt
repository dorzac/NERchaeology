A Late Archaic Multiple Burial at Lake Ray Hubbard
Catrina Banks Whitley and S. Alan Skinner

ABSTRACT
Human skeletal remains were found eroding from the lake bed of Lake Ray Hubbard in September 2011 in the
area of 41DL8. The fisherman that found the remains reported their presence to the local police department.
The Dallas Homicide Squad and a representative from the Dallas Medical Examiner’s Office exhumed some
of the remains. The exhumed skeletal elements were taken to the Medical Examiner’s Office for identification, where they were determined to be human. The following day, Dallas Homicide, a Dallas County Medical
Examiner’s representative, and researchers from the University of North Texas removed additional skeletal
remains. Ultimately, Dallas Water Utilities contracted with AR Consultants, Inc., (ARC) to complete the recovery of all bone fragments from the discovery site and to insure that no further burials were in the immediate vicinity. ARC completed excavations and surveyed the shoreline to explore for the presence of additional
human skeletal remains or burials.
Analysis of the remains and associated artifacts indicates that they are of Native American ancestry and radiocarbon dating of two bone samples, with permission of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, attributes the burials
to the Late Archaic period: cal. 1380-1130 B.C. and cal. 1120-930 B.C. Four adult males were found to have
been interred in a single burial pit; one had a developmental defect resulting in complete external auditory
atresia. All the individuals were middle-aged adults, between 35-45 years-at-death. Seven Late Archaic dart
points were found in association with the remains. The remains and associated artifacts were repatriated to the
Wichita and Affiliated Tribes.

INTRODUCTION
Archeological site 41DL8 was first reported
in 1941 by Robert C. Hatzenbuehler of the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS) during survey
of plowed fields located south of Rowlett Creek,
just upstream from its junction with the East Fork
of the Trinity River (Figure 1). At the time, the
site was described as being 900 ft. from Rowlett
Creek and resting on yellow clay that probably
corresponds to Altoga silty clay (Coffee et al.
1980:Sheet 21). Artifacts on the farmed site
surface included arrow points, blades, scrapers,
flakes, pottery sherds, and mussel shells (Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas 2011). The site was
revisited in the summer of 1963 in conjunction
with the anticipated construction of Forney Reservoir, now known as Lake Ray Hubbard (Harris
and Suhm 1963:17). The site was reported to be a
small Wylie Focus campsite that was badly eroded
and had occupational debris exposed over an area

roughly 300 x 225 ft. in size. No investigation was
recommended at the site. The site was apparently
inundated by the lake and was not visible when
the City of Garland, Texas, was planning to construct John Paul Jones Park (Nunley 1984). The
site was not visited again until the late summer of
2011 when the lake level dropped due to a major
drought. The drought exposed a section of the
lake bed near the John Paul Jones Park boat ramp.
A local fisherman noticed bones and teeth
eroding from the lakeshore near his chosen fishing spot. He discovered the remains around 7:30
p.m. on September 22, 2011, and reported the
location to the Garland Police Department around
6:30 a.m. the following morning. The Garland
Police Department then notified the Dallas Police Department (DPD) as they have jurisdiction
over the land that underlies the city-owned lake.
Thinking that this might be a modern burial site,
the Dallas Homicide Unit (DHU) was notified of
the discovery. Ultimately, an officer with the DHU

and a representative from the Dallas
Medical Examiner’s Office (DMEO)
responded to the scene.
Once on the scene, exploratory
digging by the DHU officer and the
DMEO representative commenced.
The recovered remains were then
taken to the DMEO, where they
were determined to be human in
origin. The DHU and DMEO representative returned to the scene to
complete recovery of the remains
Saturday morning. The DHU detectives set a grid of unknown size that
divided the excavation area into four
quadrants, with the center of the grid
approximately in the middle of the
location of the remains.
Shovels and rakes were utilized
in the recovery process and the remains were collected by quadrant.
Since the quadrants were not established until after the exploratory
digging, the exact provenience of the
bones was not obtained during the
DHU work. Notes or an excavation
map were also not available; however, some excavation pictures were
available. Detective Edgar J. Quirk
(personal communication 2011) saw

(ARC) to gather the bones, records, and other
information and then to conduct additional excavations at the site of the apparent burial in order
to retrieve any remaining bones and artifacts and
to explore the site area from which the bones had
been recovered. The Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, issued an Antiquities
Permit (#6112) to recover the remaining skeletal
remains and associated artifacts from the discovery area.
In September 2011, the location was relatively
dry and photographs of the scene and personal
communication with UNTLFA staff indicated that
the matrix was easily excavated. The lake level at
the time of discovery on September 22, 2011, was
429.93 feet. ARCs excavations were postponed
by several days due to precipitation. The lake
level remained constant in October and November;
however, precipitation in early December resulted
in the gain of 1.01 feet (Lakes On-Line, http://rayhubbard.uslakes.info/Level.asp, accessed January
30, 2012). This resulted in extremely sticky, wet
clay at the site during ARC excavations that commenced on December 8, 2011, and were completed
on December 12, 2011.

A thin layer of ice coated the lake bed surface
and the weather was cloudy and 31 degrees on the
morning of December 8. Upon arrival, it was apparent that the excavated pit had been filled with
some of the back dirt from the previous excavation. Fragments of human skeletal remains were
scattered across the site, although all collected
fragments were found within the barricaded area.
Dense bone fragments were concentrated near the
DHU pit; these were not individually point plotted.
A grid was set using a retaining wall as a baseline
and the northeast corner of the retaining wall as the
main datum point.
All human remains and lithic artifacts outside
the bone concentrations were point-plotted. Several
quartzite flakes were also piece-plotted and may
have been scattered with the bone elements. Most
of the point-plotted items were skeletal fragments
and included small pieces of long bone, crania,
mandible, femur, and possibly the acetabulum.
A 5 x 6 m area was gridded for scraping and
recovery within the dense bone concentrations
(Figure 5). Our initial research design designated
a 3 x 3 m grid for horizontal control, but the extensive bone scatter required the larger grid. Setting

Each unit was hand-troweled to 10

Field screening was impossible,
and thus all sediment was bagged
and brought to the laboratory for water screening. The crew collected approximately four 30-40 pound bags
of sediment per 1 x 1 m unit. The
number of bags collected depended
upon the thickness of piled backdirt
left after the previous excavations.
In unit N2E2, numerous teeth
and several small mandibular fragments were found in a concentrated
pile on the surface. The concentration included molars, incisors, and
pre-molars. Two additional teeth

long bone shafts and a mixture of rib and cranial
fragments. Since the photograph showed a stake in
the general area of the feature and that the feature
was of similar size as the wooden stake used by
DHU, it is highly probable the remains washed
into the hole that remained after DHU collected the
stakes from their grid. No definitive feature outline
could be determined.
Troweling in the center of the gridded area
resulted in the discovery of the pit excavated by
DHU, DMEO, and UNTLFA. The area was delineated and all sediments collected. The pit contained back dirt from prior excavation with bone
fragments mixed throughout the pit fill. The pit
continually filled with water once a depth of 15 cm
was reached; however, sediment removal continued
to 25 cm, at which point a distinct change in the
texture of the sterile soil had been reached. No
additional remains were found at the level of the
sterile sediments or in the pit walls. Remains were
not piece plotted within each unit due to the small
fragment sizes and since skeletal elements were

not in situ but were scattered across the site. Additionally, it was unclear if certain back dirt piles
corresponded with the DHU and DMEO quadrants
since their excavations occurred over several days,
and their grid had only been employed on the second day of excavation.
Between Thursday, December 8, 2011 and
Friday, December 9, 2011, the water level rose
approximately 10-20 cm and encroached upon the
excavation units. Excavation proved difficult due
to the water-logged conditions and texture of the
wet clay and units excavated to 10 cm bs had standing water at the base within 30 minutes.
All excavated sediment was water screened in
the ARC laboratory. An estimated 2,340 pounds
of sediment were brought to the lab for water
screening and, due to the amount of clay, water
screening took two weeks to complete. The collected sediment was mixed with baking soda and
water to dissolve the clay so the slurry could be
easily screened. All material was screened through
1/8-inch mesh in order to recover small bone

Whitley and Skinner—A Late Archaic Multiple Burial at Lake Ray Hubbard
fragments. The process was highly successful,
recovering over 12,900 countable bone fragments,
including a malleus, a middle ear ossicles.
Once the sediment was water screened, the
screened material was dried and re-bagged, according to original unit. Large amounts of calcium
carbonate nodules were present in all screened
material. The skeletal fragments were hand sorted
from the calcium carbonate. Any remains larger
than 1 mm were separated from the debris, trash,
and calcium carbonate. Identifiable fragments that
could be assigned to a skeletal element or category
of skeletal element were then sorted and stored by
unit separate from the remaining unidentifiable
bone fragments. Both identifiable and unidentifiable bone fragments collected via the screening
process were counted and cataloged per collection
bag and the total gram weight per bag tallied: 998
total identifiable fragments and 11,298 unidentifiable fragments collected during screening. Bone
fragments less than 1 mm were not sorted or
counted and the matrix, consisting of small bone
fragments and calcium carbonate nodules, was
combined and saved for repatriation. A total of
12,913 fragments were collected in the ARC, DHU,
DMEO, and UNTLFA work.
All remains collected by ARC were bagged,
counted, and weighed by unit. Due to the disturbed
context, fragments identifiable to a specific element
were matched as best as possible with the bones
collected by DHU, DCME, and UNTLFA. Horizontal control of the identifiable fragments provided no clear indication of body position or orientation, but did provide evidence that the remains
were not in situ and had been highly disturbed.
Without the possibility of identifying individuals,
all remains were analyzed as a co-mingled burial.
Bone fragments were sorted and reconstructed as
best as possible. Minimum number of individuals
was calculated per element: i.e., femora, tibiae,
talus, humerus, etc.

HUMAN REMAINS ANALYSIS
Methods, Reconstruction and MNI
Laboratory methods followed Stodder et al.’s
(2010) recommendation for working with commingled remains. All fragments were sorted according to element, when possible, and counted.
Long bone sorting included categories for bone that

215

could not be identified by element and were sorted
as large long bone fragments (tibia, femur, and
humeral fragments) and small long bone fragments
(radius, ulna, and fibula). Fragments were matched,
when possible, to larger elements. Reconstruction
efforts focused on the bones that would yield the
most information, such as the femur, tibia, and
humerus. Only a few refits were possible on the
crania and very few identifiable cranial fragments
were present.
Minimum number of individuals (MNI) was
calculated after refitting was complete. Non-repeatable skeletal elements for features were counted.
Only one element or feature could be identified
in several cases, but several elements, including
the talus, anterior crest of the tibia, medial deltoid
attachment on the humerus, complete patella, and
right radial notch on the ulna, all indicate a MNI
of four individuals (Table 1). Skeletal elements
could not be matched between individuals; however, skeletal elements could be paired within the
element in many cases. For example, two femora
could be identified as belonging to the same individual, but reconstructing which set of femora
belonged with which set of humeri or tibiae was
not possible.
Reconstruction of most skeletal elements was
also impossible due to the highly fragmented condition of the skeletal elements and trabecular bone.
The bone fragmentation was due to a combination
of the age of the skeleton and the use of shovels
and rakes by DHU and the DMEO. Auricular surfaces were present on some fragments of ilium,
but the surface was either too highly eroded or had
evidence of fresh breaks that precluded analysis.
The extreme fragmentary condition of the ilium,
ischium, and pubis prevented using these bones for
sex or age estimation.
Sex Estimation
The innominates and skull were too highly
fragmented to be reconstructed. Although some
fragments were large, the portions needed for sex
assessment were damaged. The greater sciatic notch
was visible on several ilia fragments, but most were
too small for an accurate identification. On the skull,
only six supra orbital edges were available for analysis, but none were larger than 10 mm in width. Of
the three temporal bones identifiable, two had fresh
breaks through the mastoid processes.
Individual sex was determined using talus

upon volume of the talus, calculated by obtaining the product of the talus length, width, and
height. Only two tali from 41DL8 were complete

Whitley and Skinner—A Late Archaic Multiple Burial at Lake Ray Hubbard
enough for volume measurements (Table 2) and
both indicate the individuals were male. Wilbur
(1998) utilized talus dimension to estimate sex in
prehistoric Native American remains from West
Central Illinois and tested the results against additional populations. Comparisons with Wilbur’s
(1998:185) talus breadth section points indicate
that all tali trochlea breadth measurements are
consistent with males.
One temporal bone had a complete mastoid
process. This mastoid process size is consistent
with a male/probable male, with a score of 4/5.
Scoring was based upon criteria in Buikstra and
Ubelaker (1994). A developmental defect of the
external auditory meatus is present on this bone
and it is unclear if this condition affects the size of
the mastoid process.
Age
The fragmented nature of the remains precluded
the use of typical aging methods. Of the skeletal
elements that could be assessed, the most accurate
post-cranial age that could be identified was “adult.”
The best preserved skeletal elements of these individuals were the teeth. Wear patterns were significant
and the amount of wear on the molars indicated the
individuals were at least in their mid-30s, based upon
Lovejoy’s (1985) criteria. However, using wear patterns for aging is difficult because cultural factors,
such as types of food consumed, texture of the foods,
and tool use of the teeth, can alter the rate at which
teeth wear. Sciulli (1997:231) indicates that Ohio

217

Valley Late Archaic populations had extreme rates
of wear with low frequencies of pathologies. Root
transparency is a more accurate method for aging individuals than tooth wear. Lamendin et al. (1992) and
Prince and Ubelaker (2002) used root transparency
for dental aging and Prince and Ubelaker (2002:114)
found the technique is most accurate for individuals
30 to 69 years of age. Prince and Ubelaker (2002)
also indicated that sex should be taken into account
when employing this method and may result in an
over-estimation of age. Unfortunately, their formulae
correcting for ancestry and sex did not include Native
American root transparency calculations, and therefore Lamendin et al. (1992) calculations are utilized.
Due to the lack of bone preservation, this method of
aging was the best option.
Before age could be estimated, teeth were sorted
by “individual” based upon wear patterns, presence
of alveolar bone in which teeth could be refitted after
being sorted by tooth type, and color. Maxillary and
mandibular molars were also checked for fit, ensuring wear patterns matched. Lamendin et al. (1992)
methods were used on single rooted teeth. Only a
few teeth could be measured for root transparency
since many of the teeth had taphonomic changes in
which calcium carbonate infiltrated the root of the
tooth, starting at the apex. Tooth root transparency
was measured using Mituyoto Digital calipers to the
0.01 mm level. Teeth were placed on a light board
and tooth root transparency was measured on the
labial side of the tooth.
Root height was measured from the apex
to the crown on the labial side of the tooth and

periodontosis height was also measured on the
labial portion. The formula used to calculate age was
(0.18xP)+(0.42xT)+25.53=age estimation. All age estimates fell in the middle adult range, with individuals
in the late 30s (Table 3); they can be categorized as
Middle Adult (30-50 years of age-at-death).
Stature
Stature estimates were calculated on long
bones in which segments of reconstructed bone
could be measured. Complete reconstruction was
impossible on the tibia, femora, and humeri, as
most epiphyses were missing. Femoral heads had
the greatest survival rate of the epiphyses of the
tibia, femora, and humeri, although only two could
be refit. Long bone lengths were reconstructed
from segment analysis, and segment analysis calculations were based on formula found in Steele and
McKern (1969). Their regression formulae were
based upon prehistoric American Indian populations of Mississippian period cultural affinities.
Genovés (1967) stature formulae were used
because the Genovés sample probably most closely
resembles the population under study. Sciulli et al.
(1990:276) also designed stature regression formulae that included Late Archaic skeletal remains and
represented almost half of the skeletal sample. The
stature estimates were similar to those calculated
utilizing Genovés (1967) formulae (Table 4). Bone
numbers for each skeletal element were generated
randomly and do not correlate to each other across
elements. Thus, the humerus under “Bone No. 1”
is not from the same individual listed as “Bone No.
1” femur. No stature estimates could be calculated
for bones 4, 5, 6, and 8 for all elements.

Stature reconstructions from the Genovés
(1967) formula indicate that the males range in
height from 156.77 cm to 172.04 cm. Average
stature of the individuals, including results of all
the tibiae and femora from the Genovés formula,
is 163.81 cm and the use of the Sciulli et al.
(1990) formulae resulted in an average 163.70
cm; stature estimates did not include results from
the humerus as this bone is less reliable for indicating stature. Femora 3 and 7 were matched and
resulted in similar stature reconstructions. Stature
estimates that were based upon more segments
have greater accuracy than those based upon one
segment; thus, there is the potential that some of
the calculations have underestimated the height
of the individuals.
The average stature of the four males at 41DL8
is 164.23 cm using Genové’s formulae; the stature
estimate derived from femur #3 was excluded from
the final average stature since it was determined
femora #3 and #7 were from the same individual.
This average is slightly less than that for other stature estimates for Native American in Texas (Table
5). However, stature ranges indicate that at least
one stature estimate from 41DL8 (158.96 cm) was
less than the shortest stature listed in the ranges
of the other reports, with 41AU36 and 41AU37
reporting the lowest male stature at 163.3 cm. It is
unclear to what degree the use of segment analysis
influenced the stature estimates at 41DL8. It is also
unclear whether the short statured individual was
also the same individual with the external auditory
atresia, and, as a result, was malnourished during childhood due to the developmental defect or
whether there was a condition associated with the
disease that resulted in stunting (see below).

Pathology

to develop. As a result, only a bifurcated slight
depression was present at the location where the
external auditory canal should have developed
(Figure 7). This condition is known as external
auditory atresia and this case is the most severe
expression of the condition. Complete atresia results in a tympanic plate that does not develop and
the styloid process is usually missing or is not fully
formed (Barnes 1994:198). Aplasia of the external
auditory meatus can also result in malformation of
the external ear. Although auditory atresia can be
acquired, complete atresia is generally the result of
congenital defects (Hodges et al. 1990).
Atresia can be associated with many different syndromes and congenital defects, such as
Treacher Collins syndrome. However, the condition can also occur as an isolated phenomenon.
Isolated incidences of the defect are more common
in males than females (2:1) and more commonly
occur on the right (65 percent) than the left ear
(Gorlin et al. 1995). Due to destruction of the
internal structure of the ear, the presence or malformation of the ossicles could not be observed
but the breakage revealed a pneumaticized area
in the location where the internal acoustic meatus
should have been present. The sulcus sigmoideus
was also absent. Atresia of the auditory meatus is

Little pathology was present on the skeletal
remains. There was no evidence of porotic hyperostosis or any changes associated with malnutrition
or nutritional deficiencies. Dental caries were minimal and were present on six of the 54 teeth. Caries
included occlusal and mesial dental caries and were
small, between 1-2 mm in size. One ante-mortem
loss was recorded. Periodontal degeneration was
minimal and could be observed on several molars.
Use of the dental aging technique by Lamendin et
al. (1992) required recording periodontal degeneration. The measurements all indicate minor to
moderate periodontosis. Periodontal disease was
not present on the few fragments of alveolar bone
available for analysis.
Dental wear was moderate to severe on all
teeth. Dental wear patterns were recorded according to the scoring in Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994).
Most first and second maxillary and mandibular
molars were worn until dentin was exposed across
the surface of the tooth. Wear was greatest in
individual 3’s teeth and all had dentin exposure
across the entire surface. Although attrition was
significant on the Molar 1 and Molar 2, secondary
dentin formation was not present and wear had not
exposed the pulp cavity.
Polishing indicative of occupational use was present on the incisors
of individuals 3 and 4. The lingual
portion of the upper incisors was
worn smooth on the lingual surface
and almost obliterated the presence of
shoveling. In individual 4, polishing
was also present on the lingual side of
the maxillary incisors. The maxillary
left canine and right second incisor
also had evidence of wear on the labial surface of the teeth. A flattened
location was evident across the labial
surface, consistent with material being pulled across the surface or filing.
The flattened area was oriented in a
mesial/distal pattern and was present
only on inferior portions of the teeth
closest to the occlusal plane.
The only temporal bone with an
undamaged external auditory meatus
exhibited a developmental defect.
In this case, the external auditory Figure 7. Right temporal bone with a developmental defect of the external
meatus and the tympanic bone failed auditory meatus.

Whitley and Skinner—A Late Archaic Multiple Burial at Lake Ray Hubbard
classified into three conditions, ranked by severity,
with Type III most closely associated with Treacher
Collins Syndrome. This individual must be ranked
a Type II since the deformity of a tympanic cavity
is not able to be observed and radiographs are not
present to evaluate the degree of pneumatization
of the mastoid process (typology defined in Gorlin
et al. [1995:92]). The condition affects Native
Americans at a much higher rate than in the general
population, with a rate at 1:2000 Native American
births as compared to 1:15,000 white births.
With the severe form present in this case, this
individual likely suffered from complete hearing
loss in this ear, which would have made life challenging. Unilateral hearing loss can result in an
inability to localize sound on a horizontal plane
(Humes et al. 1980), as well as communication
issues associated with speech and language delays
(Lieu 2004). There is the potential that this individual suffered from associated syndromes that
could have resulted in further life complications
and challenges; such information would require
DNA analysis since the fragmentary nature of the
bones prevented observations for additional bone
developmental defects. Only a few accounts of
this condition are reported in the archeological
literature and are from seven cases found in Peru,
a cave in New Mexico, and a mound in Arkansas
(Hrdlicka 1933), historic Canada (Swanston et al.
2011), the Late Woodland in Iowa (Hodges et al.
1990), Anglo-Saxon England (Wells 1962), and a
historic case from Slovakia (Masnicova and Benus
2001). The 41DL8 case is the oldest radiocarbondated example of this developmental defect and
possibly the oldest known archeological case. The
only additional case that may date to a similar
period and be from an individual with a huntergatherer subsistence pattern is the New Mexico
case. It is listed by Hrdlicka (1933) as being “collected by Edgar B. Howard” and was found in a
cave west of Carlsbad, New Mexico. Howard did
excavate several Basketmaker Period (2000 B.C.A.D. 500) burials in Burnett Cave (Heffner 1932)
before Hrdlicka’s report was published in 1933.
Radiocarbon Dates and Isotope Results
Five Native American tribes were contacted
about the remains in order to alert them of the remains and potential cultural affiliation. After analysis of the associated dart points, the preponderance
of the evidence indicated the Wichita and Affiliated

221

Tribes and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma were
culturally affiliated with the human remains and
NAGPRA consultation occurred. The Caddo Nation deferred any decisions regarding the remains
to the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes.
With the permission of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, cortical bone from the femora of two
individuals was submitted to Beta Analytic, Inc.
for radiocarbon dating. These bone segments were
chosen due to the good cortical bone preservation
and the fact that the fragments could be specified
as belonging to two different individuals. Beta
Analytic, Inc. reported that bone collagen was
well preserved and each sample provided adequate
amounts of carbon for the analysis and measurements to proceed normally.
Segments of bone were randomly chosen from
two individuals, with samples taken from Femur
No. 5 and No. 7. Each bone sample was washed
with deionized water, the surface was scraped free
of the outer layers, a small portion was crushed
gently, and a cold and dilute hydrochloric acid was
applied until the apatite was removed. Any rootlets
present among the collagen were removed. A sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pretreatment was applied
to be certain no secondary organic acids were present (Beta Analytic collagen extraction protocols,
http://www.radiocarbon.com/pretreatment-carbondating.htm, accessed August 22, 2012).
Radiocarbon analysis results indicate the
remains date to the Late Archaic period (1500
B.C. to A.D. 600; Table 6). The conventional
radiocarbon age on Femur No. 5 was 3010 ± 30
B.P. (Beta-327106), with a two sigma calibration of 1130-1380 B.C. The Femur No. 7 has a
conventional radiocarbon age of 2860 ± 30 B.P.
(Beta-327107), and a two sigma calibrated age
range of 930-1120 B.C.
The lack of overlap in the dates indicates that
these two individuals had not been alive at the
same time. The insufficient contextual data associated with the excavation prevents evaluating
the depositional relationship of the remains. Since
we are unsure of the exact association of the remains and whether the remains were articulated or
disturbed, we offer three scenarios that may have
resulted in the differing radiocarbon ages. One,
the burial pit could have been re-opened for subsequent burial of individuals on multiple occasions.
Due to the good preservation of the cortical bone,
it is more likely that the remains were covered
between burial events if this scenario occurred.

Two, at least one of the individuals, represented by
Femur No. 5, was bundled and retained until being
interred with the individual represented by Femur
No. 7 and the additional two undated individuals.
Since radiocarbon dates were not obtained for the
other two individuals due to financial constraints,
it is unknown if they had been bundled or died at
the same time as the Femur No. 7 individual, and
three, a minor discrepancy in the preservation of
the collagen could have resulted in the 10 year gap
between the beginning and ending of the two sigma
age ranges. It would have been difficult to dig into
a grave without disturbing the original burial. Due
to the dearth of contextual evidence, it is difficult
to assess whether the burials had been disturbed by
multiple interments.
When obtaining radiocarbon dates on bone, it
is important that nitrogen isotope values are also
obtained. This is due to the fact that the consumption of fish can result in a reservoir affect requiring
a correction to radiocarbon dates in individuals with
an aquatic component to the diet (Cook et al. 2001).
Although archeological evidence did not support
an interpretation that fishing was a component of
the Late Archaic diet, little is known regarding the
diet during this period in the North Texas area. Additionally, with the proximity of the burials to the
riverine environment, it is logical to conclude that
there was the possibility that the inhabitants relied
on fish for a portion of their diet and exploited the
aquatic resources near the burial site. Nitrogen isotope analysis was performed on the same portion of
bone removed and treated, as described above, for
radiocarbon dating. Results from δ13C were calculated during the radiocarbon dating analyses.
Nitrogen isotope analysis not only provides
important information needed for the proper

correction of radiocarbon dates on bone, but also
provides significant information on protein consumption and the type of protein being consumed,
whether terrestrial or aquatic. The carbon isotope
δ13C also provides information regarding the types
of plant material being consumed, whether C3
plants (grasses, trees, shrubs, tubers, or walnuts)
or C4 plants (maize, amaranth, and chenopodia).
Consumption of CAM plants (cacti and succulents)
have values that overlap with C3 and C4 plants
and their consumption can be identified as well
(Bousman and Quigg 2006). Ratios of δ13C can be
affected by the type of plants consumed by animals
used as protein sources in humans. For example,
bison and marine animals may consume a diet with
more C4 than C3 plants, resulting in a less negative
δ13C value than animals feeding on a C3 based diet.
This can alter the δ13C values of humans who have
a diet high in these types of protein sources.
Due to the lack of research on faunal isotope
values for North Texas, comparisons and interpretations are based on general published averages of
δ13C values (Larsen 1997; Schoeninger and Moore
1992), δ15N values (Schoeninger and Moore 1992;
Bousman and Quigg 2006; Cook et al. 2001), and
interpretations of values reported from other Archaic
and Woodland burials in Texas (Bousman and Quigg
2006). Enrichment values, differences in the preypredator values of carbon and nitrogen in the bone
collagen, are based on the case studies of Bocherens
and Drucker (2003), indicating δ13C values will
increase 0-2% and δ15N will increase 3-5%.
Isotope values of consumers of a diet based on
C3 plants will generally have δ13C values ranging
from -22% to -38% (Larsen 1997), or -20% to -24%,
averaging approximately -26% (Schoeninger and
Moore 1992). Those with a diet mostly comprised

Whitley and Skinner—A Late Archaic Multiple Burial at Lake Ray Hubbard
of C4 foods will have stable carbon isotope values
that range from -9% to -21% (Larsen 1997) or -9%
to -16%, with a mode of -12% (Schoeninger and
Moore 1992). Consumers of cactus and succulents
will have a range falling somewhere between the
two, with rates closer to C4 (Schoeninger and Moore
1992). Bousman and Quigg (2006) place the division between C3 and CAM/ C4 diets at -14% δ13C.
Nitrogen values for terrestrial diets generally fall
between +8% to +10% δ15N. Evidence of fish or marine protein sources generally results in higher δ15N
values, above +12% (calculated from Schoeninger
and Moore [1992] data). However, data from Katzenberg and Weber (1999) indicates some fish may
have lower δ15N, with one reported as +7.3%, and
that fish δ15N can widely vary (Cook et al. 2001).
Thus, future studies in the isotope values of terrestrial and freshwater resources in the North Texas
region would be extremely useful in interpreting
subsistence patterns since a baseline from the local
animals is needed to accurately calculate enrichment values.
The δ15N values at +9.5% and +9.6% from
Femora No. 5 and No. 7 indicate the neither of the
individuals consumed freshwater fish (Table 7). The
values fall within the typical values of a terrestrialbased diet, in which individuals consumed mammals such as deer and elk. Therefore, although they
resided, or were buried, next to a riverine environment, fish were not exploited by these individuals
for protein resources. If we compare these values to
results found in Shoeninger and Moore (1992), the
meat consumption is consistent with mule deer at
Pecos Pueblo (δ15N between 9-11%). The protein
consumption was likely focused on browsing mammals such as deer and on nuts, both of which were
likely in abundance in the area.
The δ13C data, at -19.6% and -18.4% (see Tables
6 and 7), indicate a dietary concentration on C3
plants and consumption of protein sources that relied
more heavily on C3 plants for their diet. Although
slightly outside the range stated by Schoeninger and
Moore (1992) of -20% to -34%, the values represent
a diet almost purely based on C3 plants with the
individuals from Lake Ray Hubbard probably
consuming some C4 plant materials, CAM (cactus
or succulents), or an occasional bison, resulting in
the slightly higher δ13C values. When compared
to the CAM-based diets reported in Bousman and
Quigg (2006), it is easily discerned that the values
reflect a greater C3 component in their diet. Only
a few individuals from Seminole Sink have δ13C

223

values comparable to the individuals from Lake
Ray Hubbard. Thus, the δ13C and δ15N values for
both individuals indicate they had a hunter-gatherer
subsistence pattern focused on browsing mammals
and wild plant foods.
These results are consistent with the overall
subsistence patterns reported for Cooper Lake sites
in the upper Sulphur River basin dating to the same
time period (Fields 2004). Late Archaic subsistence
patterns from this East Texas area entailed hunting
of animals found in woodland and woodland-edge
areas, with gathering of wild plant foods, including
nuts, tubers, and seeds. Fields (2004) reports use
of aquatic environments within the hunting zone;
however, the isotope values from Lake Ray Hubbard do not suggest the use of freshwater resources.
ASSOCIATED FUNERARY OBJECTS
Besides the presence of several pieces of finegrained quartzite lithic debris, the only artifacts
found directly associated with the grave were seven
dart points (Figure 8 and Table 8). Each point is
almost complete and the tip of dart point 1 was
found during matrix washing. The three incomplete points are missing the tip or the base. The
points were inspected by a variety of authorities
and their consensus is that the points are probably
early Late Archaic in age (Elton Prewitt, personal
communication 2012; Karl Kibler, personal communication 2012; and Dan McGregor, personal
communication 2012). All three reviewers stated
that the points are similar to Untyped Group 1 dart
points described from the Higginbotham site at
Lake Waco (Mehalchick and Kibler 2008:300-307)
that have been dated between 380-1270 B.C. at that
site. However, all three authorities agree that the
stems of the specimens from 41DL8 are too short
for the points to fit into that group of dart points.
Several of the dart points have evidence of
having been reworked. There is no evidence that
the raw materials were heat-treated before they
were manufactured. The raw materials listed in
Table 8 were identified by Larry Banks of Paradise, Texas (personal communication 2012) and
Don Wyckoff of Norman, Oklahoma (personal
communication 2012). Detailed descriptions of the
three raw materials are provided by Banks (1990).
The Edwards chert is from Central Texas and is
distinct from the Uvalde or Ogallala gravel cherts
that are found in the Dallas/Fort Worth area (Banks

Central Texas (Byrd 1971; Menzer and Slaughter
1971; Trask 2005). The Johns Valley chert is from
southern Oklahoma but actually contains older Arkansas River gravels that were mixed in the more
recent Johns Valley formation (Banks 1990:45-47).
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
The discovery of four prehistoric Native
American skeletons associated in a single pit at
41DL8 presents the opportunity to review a wealth
of information about prehistoric burials from sites
in the well-studied East Fork watershed. Burials from 14 sites (Figure 9) in the watershed are
tabulated below (Table 9) based on a compilation
provided by W.W. Crook, III (personal communication 2012) and with the addition of more recent
information from sites along Spring Creek (Peter
and Clow 2000; Linder-Linsley 1996) and Rowlett
Creek (Cliff et al. 1996; Hibbs and Hibbs 2006)
above where it empties into Lake Ray Hubbard.
This sample represents the results of extensive archeological investigations by various professionals
and avocationals of this North Central Texas watershed; all of the sites except 41DL8 and 41DL396
date to the Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 800-1400).
Comparable data are not presently available from
other watersheds in the Trinity River basin, such as
the Elm Fork, West Fork, Mountain Creek, White
Rock Creek, Richland/Chambers Creeks, and
Cedar Creek, although major investigations have
been done in each of these areas. In addition, no
comparable mass of information is available from
the upper parts of the Neches, Sabine, Sulphur, or
Brazos River watersheds.
In part, this opportunity is due to the foresight
of the members of the DAS to get permission to
conduct excavations before lake construction began after World War II throughout the East Fork
valley. Subsequent studies at Lake Lavon and Lake
Ray Hubbard were further facilitated because DAS
members had published the results of their studies
in their journal, The Record. This publication highlighted the presence of sites containing features,
such as Wylie Focus pits and house floors, as well
as site locations that are near the margin of the
Caddo archeological area, and emphasized that site
and artifact preservation was excellent.

Site 41DL8 stands out from the other sites
listed in Table 9 because it is the only site that dates
to the Late Archaic and where seven dart points
are associated with the four adult male skeletons
that were discovered. While evidence of Late Prehistoric occupation was implied for the site when
it was first recorded and again when Lake Ray
Hubbard was surveyed for archeological sites, the
presence of the seven dart points in association
with the radiocarbon-dated remains indicates that
these remains represent the oldest known burial
along the East Fork.
The summary of burials within the Lake Lavon
and East Fork watershed in Table 9 also reveals a
pattern unusual to North Texas. An apparent Late
Prehistoric pattern of interring multiple individuals
within a single pit is demonstrated by the reported
findings of 95 burials at 13 other sites that occur
in the middle reaches of the East Fork watershed
between Interstate Highway 20 and the upper end
of Lake Lavon. The burials contain a combination
of adults or adults and children in flexed positions.
On the East Fork, including 41DL8, 57 individuals were buried individually in flexed positions,
while the remaining 42 individuals were buried in
a total of 12 pits in multiples of from two to seven.
The majority of skeletons were adults and it is
expected that infants are under-represented since
their remains are more friable and do not survive
well and/or may be buried in a separate location
from adults.In rare cases decapitated bodies were
apparently placed in pits but with no grave goods
except that Burial 40 at the Lower Rockwall site
had three dart points in it.
A review of the literature reveals that sites
with burials are not reported for the area upstream
from Lake Lavon nor are any reported at sites south
from Interstate 20 to the Trinity River junction.
Upstream in Dallas County, burials are reported
from the White Rock Spillway site (Kirkland
and Harris 1941; Harris 1949; Hatzenbuehler and
Harris 1949), from the Dalbey site (Skinner et
al. 2005), and from Mountain Creek (Peter and
McGregor 1988:113-115; Skinner et al. 2007:1).
Of these burials, no confirmed multiple burials are
reported; however Feature 1 at the Baggett Branch
site (41DL149) at Joe Pool Lake could have been
a grave with two individuals but the description
is inconclusive (Peter and McGregor 1988). Otherwise, all the reported burials from these areas
are single interments, had few or no artifacts, and
appear to be Late Prehistoric in age. Almost no

57 single interments
12 multiple interments
41 burials without artifacts
28 burials with artifacts

*Burial numbers are arbitrarily assigned.

burials were found and reported at excavations in
the West Fork and the Elm Fork watersheds and
the few found were also single interments with no
associated grave goods. A burial containing two
flexed females and an expanding stem dart point
is reported from the Pecan Springs site (Sorrow
1966:8) at Lake Bardwell, in Ellis County.
To the east, no multiple burials were found
in the Sulphur River watershed despite years of
excavation at nearby Cooper Lake and only single
interments are reported from Lake Fork Reservoir
(Bruseth and Perttula 1981) and the Yarbrough site

(Johnson 1962:220-224) in the upper Sabine River
watershed. No burials were found at the Limerick
site at Lake Tawakoni (Duffield 1961), but it was
noted that artifacts from the site do not show any
affinity to those described from Wylie focus sites
in the adjacent East Fork watershed (Duffield
1961:111-112). Certainly, Late Prehistoric sites in
the East Fork watershed are not considered to be
Caddo by the Caddo Nation or by most authors.
The only comparable data come from the Sanders
site (41LR2) in Lamar County (Krieger 1946:175;
Jackson et al. 2000) where 60 individuals were

232

Texas Archeological Society

uncovered and 12 were in individual graves and the
remaining 48 were in nine graves each containing
from three to eight bodies. Other Red River Caddo
sites and multiple burial graves have been reported
downstream at the Sam Kaufman (Roitsch) site
(Skinner et al. 1969:26-36) and the Belcher Mound
site (Webb 1959:66-116).
In the East Fork, grave goods were found in
less than half of the graves and the common artifact
types are bone tools and marine shell ornaments. No
locally made pottery is reported to have been found
with any of the burials and Caddo Sanders Engraved
pottery (a water bottle and another vessel) is the only
pottery type reported as funerary offerings. Miscellaneous artifacts include dart points but not arrow
points, a boatstone, a mano, a mussel shell paint pot,
a chipped stone knife, calcite crystals, a round stone,
and red ochre. Grave goods are not as prominent as
they are in the Caddo area to the east and northeast.
In summary, the discovery of an early Late Archaic burial pit containing four adult male Native
Americans is consistent with a Late Prehistoric pattern in parts of the Upper Trinity River watershed of
burying multiple individuals in a single burial pit. This
pattern appears to be primarily unique to the East Fork
basin within the Trinity River watershed. Elsewhere,
single interment is the primary burial pattern. However, the grave at 41DL8 appears to be an exception
since the associated dart points and the radiocarbon
dates indicate that at least two of the individuals had
been placed in the ground more than 1500 years before the Late Prehistoric sites (Wylie Focus) listed in
Table 9. This lends support to the argument that the
Wylie Focus is a concept (Bruseth and Martin 1987)
that needs further exploration (Crook and Hughston
2015:158-160). The investigation at 41DL8 supports
an interpretation that Late Prehistoric occupants of the
East Fork valley were linear descendants of earlier Late
Archaic Native Americans
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We wish to thank the following people and
groups for their assistance during this investigation. First we want to thank Steve Wallace for
discovering the bones, recognizing their importance, and notifying the responsible authorities.
The Dallas Police Department (DPD) Homicide
Division is to be thanked for stepping forward in
evaluating the discovery site and contacting the
office of the Dallas Medical Examiner. DPD also
provided security for the discovery location before

and through the excavations done by ARC. The
University of North Texas Forensic Laboratory
conducted preliminary exposure and demonstrated
that the bones were prehistoric and archeological.
Terry Holmes and Bertram Vanderberg of Dallas
Water Utilities arranged to get the discovery site
investigated and assisted with coordination with
the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. Excavation was
done by the senior author who was assisted by
Katy Pocklington. The soil matrix was processed
by the ARC office staff including Rachel Hearn and
Molly Hall. W.W. “Dub” Crook, Jr. of the Houston
Archeological Society provided us with burial
information from a manuscript on Collin County
archeology that he and Mark Hughston have now
published. Terri Parton, President, and Gary McAdams, Cultural Planner, of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, facilitated approval of radiocarbon
dating of two femur fragments and the repatriation
of the bones and funerary artifacts. Radiocarbon
dates were processed at Beta Analytic, Inc. and the
cost was underwritten by ARC. A cedar box for the
remains was made by Justin Boxwell.
