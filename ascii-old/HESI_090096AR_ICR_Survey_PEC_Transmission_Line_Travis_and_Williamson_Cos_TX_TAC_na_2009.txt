Transmission Line Rebuild Project, Travis and Williamson Counties, Texas

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The Pedernales Electric Cooperative, Inc. (PEC), is proposing to rebuild an existing
overhead transmission line between its existing Marshall Ford and Buttercup substations in
Travis and Williamson counties, Texas. The proposed project would involve rebuilding the
existing transmission line, consisting primarily of replacing existing poles, along an
approximately 11.3-kilometer- (km-) (7.0-mile- [mi-]) long segment extending from the existing
Marshall Ford Substation northward to the existing Buttercup Substation. The existing Marshall
Ford Substation is located near the intersection of Ranch-to-Market Road (RM) 620 and Farmto-Market Road (FM) 2222 in Travis County, and the existing Buttercup Substation is located
south of Cedar Park in Williamson County, Texas. All proposed construction would be
undertaken within the existing right-of-way (ROW) of the transmission line, which measures
30 meters (m) (100 feet [ft]) in width. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) consists of the existing
ROW of the PEC transmission line between the existing Marshall Ford and Buttercup
substations, measuring 11.3-km (7.0-mi) in length by 30 m (100 ft) in width, covering a total area
of approximately 34 hectares (ha) (85 acres [ac]).
The proposed undertaking would be sponsored by PEC, a privately owned utilities
provider. As such, the project represents a privately sponsored undertaking on privately owned
lands and currently is not subject to federal or state statutes for cultural resources management.
As part of its due diligence practices, however, PEC subcontracted with Horizon Environmental
Services, Inc. (Horizon), via its design contractor Stanley Consultants, Inc. (SCI), to conduct a
cultural resource inventory survey of the APE associated with the proposed project.
On October 21 and 23, 2009, Horizon archeologists Reign Clark, project archeologist,
and Michael Mudd and Jared Wiersema, Field Technicians, under the overall direction of Jeffrey
D. Owens, principal investigator, performed a cultural resources survey of the APE to locate any
cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking.
The existing ROW of the transmission line traverses a variety of open upland environments as
well as areas that have experienced extensive residential, commercial, and municipal
development. The entire APE had experienced moderate to severe impacts from prior
construction of the transmission line and associated facilities. In addition, the majority of the
APE was situated in upland environments that had experienced at least some degree of
erosion, and Holocene-age soil cover was correspondingly minimal in many areas, resulting in
extensive exposures of limestone bedrock on the modern ground surface. Most of the streams

that cross the APE are erosional features located near the headwaters of the drainages in
eroded upland settings. The only substantial creek traversed by the APE is Butternut Creek,
located toward the northern end of the project area. Pleistocene-age clay sediments and
limestone bedrock are exposed on the modern ground surface on the terraces of Butternut
Creek, and no Holocene-age soils are present here. As a result of these existing conditions, the
APE was considered to possess minimal potential to contain intact, buried archeological
deposits. Any aboriginal or historic-age cultural materials within the APE would likely be visible
on the modern ground surface or contained within relatively shallow, near-surface sediment
deposits that would be detectable via shovel testing.
Horizon archeologists traversed the 11.3-km- (7.0-mi-) long by 30-m- (100-ft-) wide
existing ROW on foot in parallel transects, and the modern ground surface was thoroughly
inspected for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. In addition, the cutbanks and
channels of stream courses and erosional gullies were carefully inspected for evidence of
cultural resources. A total of 112 subsurface probes would be required in the 11.3-km- (7.0-mi-)
long by 30-m- (100-ft-) wide existing ROW. Horizon excavated a total of 90 shovel tests in the
APE; thus, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) requirements
for a project area of this length were not quite met during the survey. However, in consideration
of the relative lack of Holocene-age sediment within the APE, the ubiquity of pre-Holocene
exposures of bedrock on or near the modern ground surface, and the extent of existing
disturbances from prior construction within the APE, the shovel testing density is considered to
be more than adequate to assess the potential for subsurface cultural deposits.
No cultural resources, historic or prehistoric, were identified within the APE as a result of
the survey. The mapped location of 1 previously recorded archeological site within the APE,
41WM759, was thoroughly inspected, but no remains associated with this site were observed.
Site 41WM759 had been described as a surficial aboriginal lithic scatter that was considered to
be ineligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. No
new cultural resources were identified in the APE as a result of survey activities, and no
previously recorded sites occur in the vicinity of the project area. Furthermore, no listed historic
properties are present in the vicinity of the project area that would be adversely affected by the
proposed undertaking.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort
to identify historic properties within the APE. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as Texas State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs) according to 13 TAC 26, and no further archeological work is
recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. It is recommended that the
proposed project be cleared to proceed. However, in the unlikely event that any human remains
or burial furniture are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease
immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of the discovery.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey, PEC Marshall Ford to Buttercup Substations
Transmission Line Rebuild Project, Travis and Williamson Counties, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

The Pedernales Electric Cooperative, Inc. (PEC) is proposing to rebuild an existing
overhead transmission line between its existing Marshall Ford and Buttercup substations in
Travis and Williamson counties, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). The proposed project would involve
rebuilding the existing transmission line, consisting primarily of replacing existing poles, along
an approximately 11.3-kilometer- (km-) (7.0-mile- [mi-]) long segment extending from the
existing Marshall Ford Substation northward to the existing Buttercup Substation. The existing
Marshall Ford Substation is located near the intersection of Ranch-to-Market Road (RM) 620
and Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 2222 in Travis County, and the existing Buttercup Substation is
located south of Cedar Park in Williamson County, Texas. All proposed construction would be
undertaken within the existing right-of-way (ROW) of the transmission line, which measures
30 meters (m) (100 feet [ft]) in width. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) consists of the existing
ROW of the PEC transmission line between the existing Marshall Ford and Buttercup
substations, measuring 11.3-km (7.0-mi) in length by 30 m (100 ft) in width, covering a total area
of approximately 34 hectares (ha) (85 acres [ac]).
The proposed undertaking would be sponsored by PEC, a privately owned utilities
provider. As such, the project represents a privately sponsored undertaking on privately owned
lands and currently is not subject to federal or state statutes for cultural resources management.
As part of its due diligence practices, however, PEC subcontracted with Horizon Environmental
Services, Inc. (Horizon), via its design contractor Stanley Consultants, Inc. (SCI), to conduct a
cultural resource inventory survey of the APE associated with the proposed project.
On October 21 and 23, 2009, Horizon archeologists Reign Clark, project archeologist,
and Michael Mudd and Jared Wiersema, field technicians, under the overall direction of Jeffrey
D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed a cultural resources survey of the APE to locate
any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed
undertaking. The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the APE, and the production of a report suitable for review by the State
Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commissionâs
(THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas
Archeologistsâ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located in western Travis County and in southwestern Williamson
County near the boundary of 2 significant physiographic provincesâthe Edwards Plateau and
the Blackland Prairie. The Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone situated between
the Edwards Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east, is a low, rolling land that
extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River
Valley in northeastern Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of
low topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and
streams flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are
associated with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between
uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer
rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in
others by a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major
ecotone in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life. The
project area is situated in the Balcones Canyonlands and traverses a narrow upland divide,
named the Jollyville Plateau, between the Cypress Creek drainage basin to the west and the
Buttercup and Bull creek basins to the east. Elevations within the project area range from as
low as 271 m (890 ft) above mean sea level (amsl) to as high as 317 m (1,040 ft) amsl,
averaging about 305 m (1,000 ft) amsl.
Hydrologically, the project area is situated within the Colorado River basin. The project
area is situated in a predominantly upland setting, running along a broad upland divide that
separates the Cypress Creek basin to the west from the Buttercup and Bull creek basins to the
east. The APE traverses the erosional headwaters of various unnamed tributaries and crosses
Buttercup Creek near its northern end just south of the Buttercup Substation. Drainage is
predominantly to the west toward Cypress Creek and the Cypress Creek arm of Lake Travis
throughout most of the APE, though drainage in the Buttercup Creek basin near the northern
end of the APE is to the east. All of the lower-order streams in the area eventually discharge
into the Colorado River, which, in turn, flows southeastward across the Blackland Prairie and
the Gulf Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short distance northeast
of Matagorda Bay.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The project area is underlain by a thick sequence of Cretaceous-age, sedimentary rock
strata. Major geologic units that crop out in the vicinity of the project area include the Edwards
Limestone Formation, Glen Rose Formation (upper and lower parts), Pecan Gap Chalk, and
Austin Chalk. Specifically, the project area is underlain by Edwards Limestone (Ked) and the
Fredericksburg Group, undivided (Kfr), of the Fredericksburg Group (Proctor et al. 1974). The
Fredericksburg Group consists of thick deposits of Lower Cretaceous-age limestone and
dolomite.
The project area traverses a mosaic of rocky upland soil units (Table 1) (Werchan and
Coker 1983; Werchan et al. 1974). No deep alluvial sediments with the potential to contain
buried, intact archeological deposits are mapped within the project area. Other things being
equal, any cultural resources associated with the soils mapped in the APE would be expected to
occur on the modern ground surface in deflated, eroded contexts that would lack stratigraphic
integrity.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Travis and Williamson counties are located within the south-central climatic division.
The modern climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters.
The climate is influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it
is modified by polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring,
summer, and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental
climate characterized by considerable variations in temperature.

On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas
manifest regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east
to west and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast
(Larkin and Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to

HJN 090096 AR

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

subtropical subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81 cm (32 in) and temperature
averages 19Â°Celsius (Â°C) (67Â°Fahrenheit [Â°F]) annually, ranging from 36Â°C (96Â°F) in August (the
warmest month) to 15Â°C (59Â°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier
periods lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30 to 64 cm (12 to
25 in), were followed by abnormally wet years with 114 to 127 cm (45 to 50 in) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall.
Two extreme examples are the excess of 91 cm (36 in) of rain that fell within an 18-hour period
in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 56-cm (22-in) deluge that fell in less
than 3 hours near OâHarris, Texas, in May 1935. Lower rainfall amounts are characteristic of
winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so frequently that there is little time for
moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from west to east often dominate over
meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture is derived from the Pacific rather
than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the region, and
rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.4

BIOTA

The project area is situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian
provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943).
Some species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The
boundary, characterized as âapproximate,â between Blairâs (1950) Texan and Balconian
provinces passes through western Williamson County, northwest of the project area. Rainfall in
the Texan province is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified by Thornwaite
(1948) as a C2 (moist subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.
Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica),
and hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this
soil type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas
include the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies. Some characteristic associations of the
Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a mixed stand of loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda) and blackjack and post oak in Bastrop County, as well as a series of peat
and bog marshes distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At

Transmission Line Rebuild Project, Travis and Williamson Counties, Texas

least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert
pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens),
white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern
cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis), ground squirrel (Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana),
hispid pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), blacktailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), 9-banded armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), and jaguar (Felis onca). Both species of Terrapene known from the
Austroriparian provinceâeastern box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle (T. ornata)â
occur in the Texan province. Small herds of bison and antelope were common during the late
prehistoric and early historic periods, but these species are no longer native to this region
(Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).
Sixteen species of lizards, including 7 grassland and 9 forest species, are also found,
including green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates),
common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale), and glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis
[grassland species]), as well as collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Texas spiny lizard
(Sceloporus olivaceous), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Great Plains skink
(Eumeces obsoletus [forest species]). Only 5 species of urodele fauna are known from this
area, including small-mouthed salamander (Ambystoma texanum), tiger salamander
(Ambystoma tigrinum), and eastern lesser siren (Siren intermedia), and the Texan province acts
as a barrier to urodele distribution between the endemic Balconian province fauna to the west
and the Austroriparian fauna to the east.
Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely distributed
species, including eastern spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps), Woodhouseâs toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern
chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea),
North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and narrowmouthed toad (Microhyla carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross from the
Texan into the Austroriparian province include pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia), Streckerâs
chorus frog (Pseudacris streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea). Other reptile
and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include the 6-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis
sexlineata), rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos), rough
green snake (Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), western diamondback
rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Blanchardâs cricket frog (Acris crepitans), diamondback water
snake (Nerodia rhombifer rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis).
Common bird species include the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), killdeer (Charadrius
vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within Prewittâs (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological
Region. Prewitt (1981, 1985) demarcated the southeastern boundary of his Central Texas
Archeological Region at the town of Bastrop in Bastrop County, which borders Travis County on
the southeast. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally
nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of
the rest of North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed
markedly through time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the
PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point

styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late
PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture
shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of
groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most
markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the
Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In
addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute
evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially
accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Ãlvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de

Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as increased participation
on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement
of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was
greatly diminished.
The Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache Indians were well established in Central Texas by
the 14th century, and Comanche and Kiowa tribes arrived in the area by the 18th century 1 . The
first European known to have crossed the region was Domingo TerÃ¡n de los RÃ­os, who made an
inspection tour to East Texas in 1691. When the Spanish moved their missions out of East
Texas in 1730, they relocated the missions of San Francisco de los Neches, Nuestra SeÃ±ora de
la PurÃ­sima ConcepciÃ³n de los Hasinai, and San JosÃ© de los Nazonis to locations near Barton
Springs. In 1827, the Mexican government granted Stephen F. Austin his third colony, Little
Colony, which was located east of the Colorado River and north and west of the Old San
Antonio Road. Mina (later Bastrop) became the headquarters of the colony, and Travis County
developed as an offshoot of Mina. Settlers moving into the area in the early 1830s included
Josiah and Mathias Wilbarger, Reuben Hornsby, Jacob M. Harrell, and John F. Webber. The
onset of the Texas Revolution delayed further settlement activity, and the news of the fall of the
Alamo prompted those settlers already in residence to flee.
Settlement resumed after the revolution, but it proceeded slowly because of the constant
threat of raids by the Comanche Indians. During the 1830s, a chain of small forts extended
from Bastrop northwest along Wilbargerâs Bend, Coleman Branch, Webberâs Prairie, and
Gilleland Creek, to Fort Colorado or Fort Prairie, 8 km (5 miles) east of the site of present-day
Austin. In June 1835, Thomas Jefferson Chambers surveyed part of an 8-league grant covering
the present-day site of Austin and the capitol. Sometime before 1837, William Barton settled
near the springs that were to bear his name. In 1837 or 1838, President Mirabeau B. Lamar
was on a buffalo hunt in the area and commented on its possibilities as a permanent site for the
capital. In 1838, the community of Waterloo (later Austin) consisted of 4 families, and about
20 families established homes at nearby Montopolis in 1839. When the Congress of the
Republic of Texas chose Waterloo as the site of the new capital, opponents were quick to point
out the disadvantagesâthe site's proximity to the frontier, the lack of timber, the poor soil, and
the threat of Indian raids. In spite of this opposition, however, the new capitalârenamed Austin
in honor of Stephen F. Austinâwas approved on 19 January 1840. A few days later, the
Congress established Travis County, naming it in honor of William Barret Travis and making
Austin its county seat. An election for county officials was held in February 1840, at which time
the population was reported to be 856. The initial boundaries of Travis County included roughly

40,000 square miles. Counties that were later carved from Travis County include Callahan
(1858), Coleman (1858), Comal (1846), Gillespie (1848), Hays (1848), Burnet (1852), Brown
(1856), Lampasas (1856), Eastland (1858), Runnels (1858), and Taylor (1858). Sam Houston
moved the government of the Republic of Texas from Austin to Houston when Mexican troops
invaded San Antonio in March 1842. When he tried to have the government archives removed
as well, Austin citizens resisted with the Archives War. The Texas Congress held sessions at
Washington-on-the-Brazos from 1842 to 1845, but the convention that drafted the Constitution
of 1845 met in Austin in July 1845, and by October the rest of the government had returned to
the capital city. The first legislature of the new state convened in Austin in February 1846.
The late 1840s and early 1850s were building years for Austin and Travis County, with
much of the growth fed by the presence of the state governmentâthe Governor's Mansion,
office buildings, hotels, new homes, and newspapers. In 1850, Travis County had a population
of 3,138, of whom 2,336 were white, 791 were slaves, and 11 were free blacks; by 1860, the
number of residents had more than doubled to 8,080, with 4,931 of them white, 3,136 slaves,
and 13 free blacks. Although the city of Austin grew faster than the county as a wholeâits
population rose from 629 in 1850 to 3,494 in 1860âmost county residents lived in small
communities. Pflugerville and Del Valle were the most prominent of these communities, but
rural post offices were also established at Bluff Springs, Webberville, Merrilltown, Gilleland,
Cageâs Mill, and Hornsby Bend. During the 1850s, the amount of land in farms in what was
then Travis County increased from 73,300 acres to 1,363,500 acres. Corn was the primary field
crop, while cattle and sheep were the principal livestock. In 1860, farmers produced
137,700 bushels of corn and 27,900 bushels of wheat and had 58,000 cattle and 11,800 sheep.
The earliest schools in Travis County were private institutions that usually met in private
homes or in space donated by a church or Masonic lodge. More elaborate private facilities
began to appear by the late 1840s, including Colorado Female College in 1848, Austin Male
and Female Academy in 1849, Austin Female Academy in 1850, and Austin Collegiate Female
Institute in 1852. By 1850, Travis County also had 6 public schools serving a scholastic
population of 183. The county was divided into 19 common school districts in 1852. The state
established the Asylum for the Blind in Austin in 1856 and the Deaf and Dumb School in 1857.
Travis County became a center for higher education in the 1880s with the establishment of the
University of Texas in 1881, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute in 1881, and Saint
Edward's University in 1885. Samuel Huston College began holding classes in the 1890s. The
Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary opened in 1902, Texas Wesleyan College Academy
in 1912, Concordia Lutheran College in 1926, and the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the
Southwest in 1952. Austin Community College began operations in 1972. The availability of
schools resulted in a high level of education for a large portion of the countyâs population. In the
1940s, while more rural areas of the state reported that less than 10% of their population over
the age of 25 had high school diplomas, nearly 20% of Travis County residents had graduated.
By 1980, that number had jumped to 75%.
The earliest churches in Travis County were the Catholic missions relocated to the area
by the Spanish in 1730, but these were moved to San Antonio in 1731, and it was more than a
century before any organized religious practices were firmly established. In the 1830s, a variety

14

of religious groups began to appearâMethodist circuit riders held services along Gilleland
Creek in 1837 or 1838; Presbyterians organized a church in Austin in October 1839; Mormons
settled near Fort Coleman, Webberville, and Hornsby Bend in the late 1830s; and Catholic
priests, among them Jean Marie Odin, returned to the area in 1840. A Baptist church and a
Church of Christ were organized in Austin in 1847, a Lutheran church was established in New
Sweden and a Jewish synagogue in Austin began in 1876, and a Christian Science church
formed in Austin in 1889. In the early 1980s, Travis Countyâs 266 churches had an estimated
combined membership of 194,194; Catholic, Southern Baptist, and United Methodist were the
largest denominations.
In spite of the rapid growth that Travis County experienced during the 1850s, the area
was at that time still very much at the edge of the frontier. The absence of railroads meant that
goods had to be shipped by wagon to and from Houston and Port Lavaca, and poor roads
meant that goods sometimes could not be shipped at all. In 1852, the Austin Railroad
Association was established to encourage railroad construction to the area, and considerable
progress had been made by the late 1850s; however, the Civil War intervened, and work on
railroad acquisition was postponed. The Secession Convention convened in Austin on
28 January 1861. Although a group of Austin citizens staged a demonstration in favor of
secession, Unionist sentiment was high, and Travis County residents voted against secession,
704 to 450. Nevertheless, when the Civil War began, Travis County provided several hundred
volunteers, among them the Travis Rifles, the Tom Green Rifles, the Capitol Guard, and the
Austin City Light Infantry. In the 2 months between the end of the war and the arrival of federal
troops in the county, looting of farms and businesses was common. Although the inevitable
clashes between the Unionist forces and the former rebels resulted in the arrest of as many as
30 people per day, the presence of federal troops served to curb much of the lawlessness. By
early 1866, most of the federal soldiers had been mustered out of service, leaving only about
200 men to police the Austin area until the end of the military occupation in 1870. Austin was
the site of the constitutional conventions of 1866 and 1868-69 and witnessed both the removal
of Governor James W. Throckmorton in 1867 and the Coke-Davis Controversy in 1874. In the
gubernatorial election of 1869, Travis County residents favored Andrew J. Hamilton to Edmund
J. Davis by a margin of 798 to 593.
Like most areas in the south, Travis County suffered considerable economic hardship
immediately after the Civil War and throughout the Reconstruction period. Between 1864 and
1866, the county as a whole experienced a 49% loss in property tax receipts. Roughly 2/3 of
this property loss was in slaves, with the rest coming from declines in farm and livestock values,
each of which fell 25 to 40%. The county began to show signs of recovery by 1880. The overall
population rose from 13,153 in 1870 to 27,028 in 1880, and the 1880 census reported
1,912 farms, an increase of 656 over the 1870 totals. The amount of improved land rose from
83,200 acres in 1870 to 139,800 in 1880. Field crops such as corn, cotton, wheat, and oats
took up nearly half of the improved farmland, while livestock dominated the rest.
Economic recovery was facilitated by the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central
Railway, which completed its track to Austin in 1871, and the International and Great Northern
Railroad, which was built between Rockdale and Austin in 1876 and completed from Austin to

Laredo in 1881. The Austin and Northwestern Railroad laid track between Austin and Burnet in
1882, and the Missouri, Kansas and Texas line arrived in 1904. Communities besides Austin
that benefited directly from easy railroad access included Pflugerville, Manor, Oak Hill, and
Manchaca. After the war, many former slaves remained in the area. In the year after the war,
the black population increased by 60%, while the white population rose by only 12%. By 1870,
black residents numbered 4,647, comprising 35% of the county's total population. Clarksville,
Kincheonville, Masontown, and Wheatville were among the communities established by former
slaves. The number of black residents in Travis County continued to increase steadily, reaching
13,299 in 1900. It fluctuated between 13,000 and 15,000 from 1900 to 1930, but increased
rapidly thereafter, rising to 22,493 in 1950, 32,270 in 1970, and 63,173 in 1990. Because other
segments of the population grew at an even faster rate, the percentage of black residents, with
respect to the total population, declined significantly, falling to 20% by 1930 and 11% by 1990.
Contributing to the shift in the ethnic makeup of the county was a variety of immigrant groups,
the most prominent of which were German, Swedish, and Mexican. By the turn of the century,
8% of the population was composed of natives of 1 of these countries. Although the early
Swedish and German settlers contributed to the diversity of Travis County through their religious
and educational institutions, the Mexican influence was also reinforced by the continued arrival
of large numbers of new immigrants fleeing the unrest of the Mexican Revolution in the early
20th century. The 1930 census reported that 10,225 residents, or 13% of the countyâs total
population, were of Hispanic descent; by 1990, the number of Hispanic residents had risen to
121,689, or 21%.
In 1890, Travis County had 36,322 residents. Of these, 14,575 lived in Austin, which
was fast outgrowing its efforts to become a modern city. Innovations and improvements in
progress at that time included a trolley system and water-generated electricity, but most of its
streets remained unpaved. By the turn of the century several hundred assorted businesses
filled the needs of the 22,000 Austin residents. Yet, in spite of this rapid increase in Austinâs
population, the majority of the countyâs residents lived on farms or in smaller towns, and
agriculture dominated the area economy. Cotton became the principal field crop in the late
1880s and remained so for more than 60 years. The 1890 census reported 65,000 acresâ
nearly 30% of the county's improved farmlandâplanted in cotton; by the turn of the century, the
amount of land devoted to cotton had increased to 113,300 acres, or 56% of the improved
farmland. However, as more marginal land was used and the soil became depleted, production
levels fell; in 1930, 143,000 acres produced only 19,000 bales. By the late 1950s, cotton
accounted for only 26% of the total cropland harvested, and by 1980 it had fallen to only 8%.
Farm tenancy had increased steadily since the 1890s and peaked in 1930, with tenants
operating two-thirds of the 3,642 farms. The number of farms fell by more than 1,000 in the
1930s, as many tenant farmers either moved away or turned to other occupations. Farmers
who remained in the area began to devote more of their resources to crops other than cotton
and to livestock. The number of cattle increased from 32,000 in 1920 and to 51,000 in 1950;
the number of sheep and goats increased as well, boosting wool and mohair production from
23,600 and 4,292 pounds, respectively, in 1920, and to 127,800 and 183,600 pounds in 1959.
By the late 1960s, hay and sorghum combined to account for 60% of the cropland harvested.

The Great Depression was slow to hit Travis County, but, by the mid-1930s, many
people were unemployed and very glad of the New Deal programs that resulted in work paving
streets; building bridges, sewers, and parks; and constructing the tower of the University of
Texas campus. In part because of the job opportunities made available through relief projects,
state government, and the university community, the population increased by 43% in the 1930s,
rising from 77,777 in 1930 to 111,053 in 1940. One major job-producing project in the 1930s
was the construction of a series of dams on the Colorado River. Austin and Travis County had
begun efforts to tame the Colorado as early as 1869, when the army built a pontoon bridge
across the river. In 1893, the City of Austin completed a dam designed to provide power for its
water and electrical systems. By 1899, the city was already experiencing power shortfalls, and
a major flood in 1900 destroyed the dam. Another flood in 1915 washed out the repairs that
were underway, and the project was abandoned. The flood of 1935 put much of downtown
Austin under water, and the areaâs interest in a lasting flood-control system was renewed. The
Lower Colorado River Authority was established and a series of dams was built, forming Lake
Austin, Lake Travis, Lake Buchanan, Lake Lyndon B. Johnson, Inks Lake, and Lake Marble
Falls. Travis County also profited from the establishment of several military bases. Camp
Mabry in northwest Austin, established as the main Texas National Guard facility in 1890,
served as an army training center during World War I. After the US became involved in World
War II, the Del Valle Army Air Base, soon renamed Bergstrom Army Air Field, was established
in southeast Travis County. After the war was over, the presence of military personnel
continued to bring changes to the county. Thousands of returning veterans enrolled in the local
colleges and universities, greatly increasing the student population as well as intensifying the
demand for housing and the growth of service industries.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Travis County underwent 2 significant developments. The first
of these was desegregation. The Sweatt v. Painter decision in 1950 pushed the University of
Texas to the forefront in the fight for civil rights, leading it to become the first southern university
to admit blacks as undergraduates, although it was not until 1962 that all of the universityâs
facilities were fully integrated. Public schools in Travis County began to follow suit in 1955.
Local Mexican-American organizations also achieved a measure of success against
discriminatory practices. Some local businesses resisted these changes, prompting strikes and
protests in the 1960s, but in the end desegregation was accomplished without the violence
prevalent in other urban areas of the country. The change became even more visible as blacks
and Hispanics were elected to public officeâWilhelmina Delco to the school board in 1968 and
to the Texas House of Representatives in 1976; Berl Handcox to the Austin city council in 1971;
Richard Moya to the Travis County commissionerâs court in 1970; and Gonzalo Barrientos to the
Texas House of Representatives in 1974.
The second major development was the
establishment of several high-tech industries. In 1951, a small, local company became Texas
Instruments, and in 1955 Tracor, Incorporated, made Austin its base of operations.
International Business Machines opened an Austin branch in 1967, followed by Motorola in
1974. These companies, along with Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation
(1983), Dell Computers (1984), and Sematech (1988), became the countyâs largest employers.
From the end of Reconstruction to the present, most Travis County residents chose to
support Democratic presidential candidates, with exceptions in 1896, 1928, 1952, 1956, 1972,

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

and 1984. Occasionally, a third-party candidate drew a sizable portion of the vote, but only 3 of
themâthe Greenback-Labor candidate in 1880, George Wallace in 1968, and John Anderson in
1984âgarnered sufficient support to affect the countyâs overall election results. In state
elections, Travis County residents were staunchly Democratic. In the early 1980s, 63% of the
land in Travis County was devoted to farms and ranches. About 23% of the farmland was under
cultivation, with sorghum, hay, wheat, and cotton accounting for nearly 70% of the 94,000 acres
harvested; other crops included potatoes, sweet potatoes, peaches, and pecans. Sixty-six
percent of the countyâs $32 million in agricultural receipts came from livestock and livestock
products, the most important ones being cattle, milk, sheep, wool, and hogs. Although
agriculture remained an important aspect of the local economy, farm receipts were greatly
surpassed by the income generated by non-agricultural industries. Professional and related
services, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and government administration involved
70% of the work force in the 1980s; of the rest, 7% were self-employed and 3% employed
outside the county. Since shortly after the turn of the century, the majority of Travis County
residents had resided in the City of Austin. The jobs made available by the growth of the hightech industries reinforced that trend, and, by 1970, 85% of the 295,516 residents lived in the
capital city. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, residential development near Lake Travis
encouraged many people to move away from the city, and although Austin continued to grow at
a rapid pace, the number of residents choosing to live near the lake and in northern and
southern suburbs increased at an even faster rate. By 1990, Lago Vista (2,199), Jonestown
(1,250), Briarcliff (335), Lakeway (4,044), and Pflugerville (4,444) in Travis County, as well as
Round Rock and even Georgetown in Williamson County, had become popular alternatives to
living in Austin. Like the rest of Texas, Travis County weathered a serious economic downturn
in the mid-1980s; newly-built office space sat empty, and many people lost their jobs. Added to
this was news that Bergstrom Air Force Base was scheduled to close. In the early 1990s,
however, plans were underway to convert the Bergstrom site into a new municipal airport, and
the county was looking forward to a period of growth. The population of Travis County was
reported at 576,407 in 1990, an increase of 37% from 1980. Among the areaâs most prevalent
concerns was that future growth should not destroy the ecological balance of environmentally
sensitive areas in the western hills.

4.0 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

The cultural resource survey described in this report was undertaken with 3 primary
research goals in mind:
1. To locate and record cultural resources occurring within the designated project area
2. To provide a preliminary assessment of the significance of these resources regarding
their potential for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or
for designation as Texas State Archeological Landmarks (SALs)
3. To make recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and/or SAL assessments
The first of these goals was accomplished by means of a review of documentation on file
on the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THC) online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the
National Park Serviceâs (NPS) online National Register Information System (NRIS), the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the General Land Office (GLO), and the Texas
State Historical Associationâs and the General Libraries at The University of Texas at Austinâs
Handbook of Texas Online, as well as a program of intensive survey of the project area. No
cultural resources were documented as a result of this survey, so the second and third of these
goals were not pursued. The rest of this chapter presents the methodological background for
the current investigations and the specific survey methods used in the field.

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to conducting the archeological fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed existing
archival documentation to acquire information on (1) previous cultural resource investigations
conducted in the vicinity of the project area, and (2) any previously documented cultural
resource properties in or near the survey corridor. This review consisted of an examination of
locations within 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of each side of the existing ROW (i.e., a 1.6-km- [1.0-mi-] wide
review area along the approximately 11.3-km- (7.0-mi-) long existing ROW). Archival research
conducted on the THCâs online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas indicated that 64 previously
recorded archeological sites occur within the search area (Table 2).
Of the 64 previously recorded archeological sites, only 1 site is located within or
immediately adjacent to the existing ROW. This site, 41WM759, was recorded as an aboriginal

lithic scatter that was considered to be ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP. All other previously
recorded archeological sites are recorded beyond the limits of the existing ROW.
Based on the archival review, the existing ROW itself has not been formally assessed for
cultural resources in the past; however, the existing ROW does pass through at least 6 tracts of
land that were assessed for cultural resources prior to development. These previously
assessed tracts appear to encompass roughly 20% of the existing ROW.

4.2

SURVEY METHODS

On October 21 and 23, 2009, Horizon archeologists Reign Clark, project archeologist,
and Michael Mudd and Jared Wiersema, field technicians, under the overall direction of Jeffrey
D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed a cultural resources survey of the APE to locate
any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed
undertaking. Field conditions were mixed at the time of the surveyâthe fall sky was clear to
overcast and rain was occasional, though ground surface visibility was generally excellent. The
existing ROW of the transmission line traverses a variety of open upland environments as well
as areas that have experienced extensive residential, commercial, and municipal development.
Open uplands characterize much of the southern portion of the APE (Figure 3), while urban and
suburban development is more common toward the northern end (Figures 4 to 5). The entire
APE had experienced moderate to severe impacts from prior construction of the transmission
line and associated facilities. In addition, the majority of the APE was situated in upland
environments that had experienced at least some degree of erosion, and Holocene-age soil
cover was correspondingly minimal in many areas, resulting in extensive exposures of
limestone bedrock on the modern ground surface (Figure 6). Numerous roads as well as
surface and subsurface utility lines cross the APE, and 3 existing substations associated with
the existing transmission line occur within the APEâthe Marshall Ford Substation at the south
end, the Balcones Substation at the midpoint, and the Buttercup Substation at the north end
(Figure 7). Most of the streams that cross the APE are erosional features located near the
headwaters of the drainages in eroded upland settings. The only substantial creek traversed by
the APE is Butternut Creek, located toward the northern end of the project area (Figure 8).
Pleistocene-age clay sediments and limestone bedrock are exposed on the modern ground
surface on the terraces of Butternut Creek, and no Holocene-age soils are present here. As a
result of these existing conditions, the APE was considered to possess minimal potential to
contain intact, buried archeological deposits. Any aboriginal or historic-age cultural materials
within the APE would likely be visible on the modern ground surface or contained within
relatively shallow, near-surface sediment deposits that would be detectable via shovel testing.
In general, intensive cultural resource survey activities entail a pedestrian walkover with
surface inspection as well as subsurface shovel testing. The 11.3-km- (7.0-mi-) long by 30-m(100-ft-) wide existing ROW was traversed on foot by Horizon archeologists in parallel transects
and the modern ground surface was thoroughly inspected for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources. In addition, the cutbanks and channels of stream courses and erosional gullies were
carefully inspected for evidence of cultural resources. The Texas State Minimum Archeological
Survey Standards (TSMASS) for cultural resource surveys state that, for linear projects, a

minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile of 30-m- (100-ft-) wide linear corridor is required unless
field conditions warrant excavation of more shovel tests (e.g., due to the presence of culturally
sensitive areas) or less shovel tests (e.g., due to extensive prior disturbances or cultural lowprobability areas). In the event that a shovel test yields evidence of subsurface cultural
deposits, additional shovel tests may be necessary to determine the horizontal and vertical
extent of the subsurface deposits associated with the cultural resource. In general, shovel tests
measure approximately 30 centimeters (cm) (12 inches [in]) in diameter and are excavated to a
target depth of 1.0 m (3.3 ft) below ground surface, to the top of pre-Holocene deposits, or to
the maximum depth practicable, and all sediments are screened through 6.35-millimeter (mm)
(0.25-in) hardware cloth. Thus, a total of 112 subsurface probes would be required in the 11.3km- (7.0-mi-) long by 30-m- (100-ft-) wide existing ROW. Horizon excavated a total of 90 shovel
tests in the APE; thus, the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this length were not quite
met during the survey. However, in consideration of the relative lack of Holocene-age sediment
within the APE, the ubiquity of pre-Holocene exposures of bedrock on or near the modern
ground surface, and the extent of existing disturbances from prior construction within the APE,
the shovel testing density is considered to be more than adequate to assess the potential for
subsurface cultural deposits. Shovel test data are summarized in Appendix A, and maps of
shovel test locations are presented in Appendix B.
The TSMASS also require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas with
the potential to contain buried cultural materials at depths below those that shovel tests are
capable of reaching (approximately 80 to 100 cm below surface [cmbs] or more in sandy
sediments or 40 to 60 cmbs in clayey sediments). Due to the presence of pre-Holocene
sediments and bedrock at or near the modern ground surface, Holocene-age soils were either
very shallow or absent in most areas of the APE; as such, shovel testing constituted an effective
and adequate technique for penetrating to the bottom of sediments with the potential to contain
cultural resources, and backhoe trenching was not necessary.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a âreasonable and goodfaith effortâ to locate significant archeological sites within the project areas as defined in
36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3, though the TSMASS minimum shovel testing
requirements were not met in all cases due to the extent of existing impacts and the
geomorphological characteristics of the project area that argued against more extensive shovel
testing.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken and a photographic
log was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources.
Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with makerâs marks) and
non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. No cultural materials were collected during the survey. The Universal
Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of all shovel tests and backhoe were determined using
hand-held Garmin ForeTrex Global Positioning System (GPS) devices based on the North
American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).

Transmission Line Rebuild Project, Travis and Williamson Counties, Texas

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

PEC is proposing to rebuild an existing overhead transmission line between its existing
Marshall Ford and Buttercup substations in Travis and Williamson counties, Texas. The
proposed project would involve rebuilding the existing transmission line, consisting primarily of
replacing existing poles, along an approximately 11.3-km- (7.0-mi-) long segment extending
from the existing Marshall Ford Substation northward to the existing Buttercup Substation. The
existing Marshall Ford Substation is located near the intersection of RM 620 and FM 2222 in
Travis County, and the existing Buttercup Substation is located south of Cedar Park in
Williamson County, Texas. All proposed construction would be undertaken within the existing
ROW of the transmission line, which measures 30 m (100 ft) in width. The APE consists of the
existing ROW of the PEC transmission line between the existing Marshall Ford and Buttercup
substations, measuring 11.3-km (7.0-mi) in length by 30 m (100 ft) in width, covering a total area
of approximately 34 ha (85 ac).
On October 21 and 23, 2009, Horizon archeologists Reign Clark, project archeologist,
and Michael Mudd and Jared Wiersema, field technicians, under the overall direction of Jeffrey
D. Owens, Principal Investigator, performed a cultural resources survey of the APE to locate
any cultural resource properties that potentially would be impacted by the proposed
undertaking. The 11.3-km- (7.0-mi-) long by 30-m- (100-ft-) wide existing ROW was traversed
on foot by Horizon archeologists in parallel transects, and the modern ground surface was
thoroughly inspected for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. In addition, the cutbanks
and channels of stream courses and erosional gullies were carefully inspected for evidence of
cultural resources. Horizon excavated a total of 90 shovel tests in the APE; thus, the TSMASS
requirements for a project area of this length were not quite met during the survey. However, in
consideration of the relative lack of Holocene-age sediment within the APE, the ubiquity of preHolocene exposures of bedrock on or near the modern ground surface, and the extent of
existing disturbances from prior construction within the APE, the shovel testing density is
considered to be more than adequate to assess the potential for subsurface cultural deposits.
No cultural resources, historic or prehistoric, were identified within the APE as a result of
the survey. The mapped location of 1 previously recorded archeological site, 41WM759, was
thoroughly inspected, but no remains associated with this site were observed. Site 41WM759
had been described as a surficial aboriginal lithic scatter that was considered to be ineligible for
inclusion on the NRHP.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:

â¢

Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.

â¢

Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.

â¢

Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the APE and to make preliminary determinations of whether or not the
resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with
important historic events and/or personages. Under the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of
Texas, archeological resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the
significance of archeological resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs,
respectively.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory
process.

6.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR Â§60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

6.3

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ARCHEOLOGICAL LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are
located in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any
county, city, or political subdivision of the state are state archeological landmarks and are
eligible for designation.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under
Section 26.8 of Part 2 of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may
designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he siteâs archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

6.4

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

No cultural resources, historic or prehistoric, were identified within the APE as a result of
the survey. The mapped location of 1 previously recorded archeological site, 41WM759, was
thoroughly inspected, but no remains associated with this site were observed. Site 41WM759
had been described as a surficial aboriginal lithic scatter that was considered to be ineligible for
inclusion on the NRHP.

6.5

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. No
new cultural resources were identified in the APE as a result of survey activities, and no
previously recorded sites occur in the vicinity of the project area. Furthermore, no listed historic

HJN 090096 AR

31

Chapter 6.0: Summary and Recommendations

properties are present in the vicinity of the project area that would be adversely affected by the
proposed undertaking.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort
to identify historic properties within the APE. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as SALs according
to 13 TAC 26, and no further archeological work is recommended in connection with the
proposed undertaking. It is recommended that the proposed project be cleared to proceed.
However, in the unlikely event that any human remains or burial furniture are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the THC should be
notified of the discovery.
