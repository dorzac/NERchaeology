FOOD HABITS OF THE TEXAS COASTAL
INDIANS IN THE EARLY SIXTEENTH
CENTURY 1
ALEX

D.

KRIEGER

It has always been very difficult to obtain detailed information on the foods eaten by American Indians while in
their purely native condition; that is, uninfluenced by European civilization. The archeologist may often obtain bones,
shells, and charred vegetal matter, and through laborious
identifications, obtain some insight into what forms of life
were hunted and gathered. Even under the most ideal conditions, however, the human factor is missing and we can
hardly know anything about how the countryside was exploited during the various seasons, or how far the natives
may have traveled to obtain any particular kind of food.

The journals and accounts of early explorers seldom go
beyond the generalities that the natives did or did not practice agriculture, or merely that they did hunt, fish, or collect
wild foods. This tells us little about the food-gathering techniques, the density of population that could be sustained by
the techniques known, the size of the communities, or the
ways in which man himself may have changed the natural
environment :by selecting some foods, thus altering the natural competition between species.
This brief study summarizes certain valuable data left us
by the first Europeans who are known to have lived along
the Gulf shores of Texas. This was during the period 1528
to 1534, only 36 years after the first voyage of Columbus to
the New World. The Texas coast was roughly mapped by a
Spanish navigator, Pineda, in 1519, but if he had any contacts with the natives they must have been very limited.
The data referred to are, of course, those left us by Alvar
Nuiiez Cabeza de Vaca in "Los Naufragios~' ("The Shipwrecks"), first published in 1542; and the paraphrasing of

48

Texas Archeological Society

this narrative by the Spanish historian Oviedo y Valdez in
his "Historia General y Natural de Indias", Vol. III, book
XXV, pp. 582-618, written in about 1546.
An extensive study of the adventures of Ca:beza de Vaca
and his three companions, the sole survivors of the 600-man
expedition of Pamfilo de Narvaez, who lived among the
Texas coastal Indians for some six years before crossing the
continent to emerge on the Gulf of California, is under
preparation by the writer and is to be published in book
form. This will also include new translations of both original documents and will explain numerous conclusions made
about the direction of the route taken by the four survivors.
Therefore, these intriguing and vexing matters will not be
discussed here.
The Narvaez expedition left Spain in 1527 with the intention of colonizing some part of "Florida", which then included the whole northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico from
present Florida west and south to the fort of Panuco, established by Cortes near present Tampico, Mexico. After various disasters, about 250 men left present northwestern
Florida in five barges constructed by themselves and attempted to sail and paddle their way along the coast to
Panuco. In crossing the Mississippi River mouth, currents
and winds separated the five :barges but all were eventually
cast up at different places on the coast of Texas, in November 1528. Two of them, however, including that commanded
by Cabeza de Vaca, were cast up on the same island on successive days. Of the approximately 95 men in these two
barges, all but 15 died of sickness, cold, and hunger the first
winter, and within a year or two only four remained alive:
Cabeza de Vaca, Dorantes, Castillo, and Dorantes' Negro
slave, Estevanico. The occupants of the other three barges
were heard of from time to time as those of the first two
barges made their way along the central coast of Texas; but
all died in one way or another in a short time. Contrary to
popular belief, only a few of the 250 men were killed by
Indians and these were in a relatively small area.

Food Habits of the Texas CoastaL Indians

'11he narratives descr1be certain food habits of the natives
in three areas: (1) the island of Malhado (Bad Luck) where
the first two barges landed and the mainland nearby; (2) the
central coast of Texas in an area which undoubtedly included the shores of Matagorda, Lavaca, and San Antonio
Bays and the lower valley of Guadalupe River; and (3) the
South Texas monte, a great expanse of rolling plains with
little water, covered with thorny brush and cacti, which
stretches from the lower Nueces River southward to the Rio
Grande delta and westward across the Rio Grande into
Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon, Mexico.
MALHADO
This island has often been identified as Galveston Island,
but this is much too large to fit the descriptions. More
likely, Malhado was the present Oyster Bay Peninsula, the
tip of which is a few miles southwest of Galveston Island.
Although this identification requires that what is now a
sandy peninsula was separated from the mainland over 400
years ago, it is becoming well known among geologists that
many alterations in the Texas coast line have occurred in
modern times >b y the actions of currents, sedimentation,
tides, winds and hurricanes.
The Indians of Malhado were called Han and Capoque.
They and those on the mainland nearby lived in a state of
near starvation the year around. Although one would naturally assume that plenty of fish and shellfish were available to them at all times, Cabeza de Vaca tells us that their
main diet consisted of roots collected at great labor. Some
roots were taken from under water and were said to have
tasted like nuts; others were dug from the ground with
sticks. Fish are mentioned several times but always with the
qualification that they were ''few" or "a little". Skates are
the only kind specifically named. No nets or spears are mentioned, but there were weirs and Oviedo states that fish were
killed from canoes. From this it might be inferred that fish
were speared from canoes, :b ut it is also possible that they
were shot with bow and arrow for this weapon is mentioned

50

Texas Archeological Society

repeatedly in other connections and is, in fact, the only
weapon named for any part of the Texas coast.
The roots that tasted like nuts were collected mainly in
November and December. By the end of February .the roots
were beginning to sprout and were then not good to eat. For
the next three months oysters were almost the sole article
of diet. This seems to have been during January, February,
and March but the statements are somewhat confusing and
the season may have been from February through April.
The harvest of oysters must have been considerable, for it
is said that the Indians placed their houses on top of oyster
beds-undoubtedly referring to piles of discarded shells.
The houses were portable, being carried about on canoes
and on human backs. It may be doubted that such dwellings
were substantial enough for the archeologist to find traces
of their postholes; and furthermore they must have stood on
the shell heaps only a quarter of the year.
AHer the oysters, !blackberries were the mainstay for one
month, either April or May. From May to November was
the most desperate time; herbs, roots, and fish were not
enough and the Indians had to turn to spiders, lizards,
snakes, mice, crayfish, etc., to exist.
Although there are no specific statements, one's impression is that these people never traveled very far in search
of food, merely passing back and forth between Malhado and
the mainland according to the season. They were on the island when the Spanish barges landed in November of 1528,
and they went to the mainland during the winter-that is,
during the oyster season. Cabeza de Vaca, having spent four
years in this area as a trader among the ilndians, did travel
considerably along the coast and as much as 50 leagues inland, but he gives no indication that the natives moved about
much, and he specifically states that during the coldest
months they stayed in their houses. Probably this was made
possible because the oysters were available in this season.
I should like to mention briefly certain facts bearing on
the commonly accepted "hokum" that these coastal Indians

Food Habits of the Texas Coastal Indians

51

were fierce cannibals. This notion is always given a big
play in newspaper articles and is perpetuated everywhere
in Texas by public school teachers. It sounds exciting and
it enables Texans to feel some justification for their extermination of these tribes in the 19th century. Anthropologists
and archeologists themselves have done little to counteract
this fallacy, nor have they objected too much to news stories
that report broken human bones as "evidence" of cannibalism. Any archeologist knows that split and broken human
bones are normal in excavated burials, due to the weight of
over-burden, action of plant roots, and other causes.
In some manner which I have never understood, the plain
statements of Cabeza de Vaca on thris subject have become
completely reversed. The narratives of both de Vaca and
Oviedo leave not the slightest doubt that two groups of the
Spaniards ate their own dead during the first terrible winter. Caheza de Vaca furthermore makes it crystal clear that
these Indians not only did not eat human flesh, but on the
contrary were so shocked on learning that the Spaniards had
done this that, if they had known, they would have killed
the 'Spaniards in advance for being so barbarous!
It is also beyond dispute that the Indians of Malhado
treated the shilpwrecked strangers with the greatest kindness they were capable of. The starved, naked, and nearly
frozen castaways were literally carried to the Indians' huts
while fires were built along the way to warm them. What
little food they had was cheerfully shared. The Spaniards
were also touched by the Indians "howling like brutes" at
their (the Spaniards') misfortunes. "Cannibals", indeed!

Other customs mentioned are interesting because they
tended to inc1·ease rather than to decrease starvation among
certain individuals. Thus: "When it happens that someone
marries off his daughter, from that day on everything that
the groom kills in hunting and fishing is brought by the
wife to the house of her father", and "when a son or brother
dies, in the house where he happens to die, during three
months they do not search for food, rather let themselves

52

Texas Archeological Society

die of hunger, and their relatives and neighbors provide
what they are to eat ... so that in the majority of houses
there was great famine on account of keeping this custom".
CENTRAL GULF COAST OF TEXAS
In this area the narratives outline two seasons of comparative plenty. In the late fall, probably November and
December, the Mariames and related tribes went to a river
which was undoubtedly the lower Guadalupe near present
Victoria, to eat pecans in large groves of these trees. During
three summer months, July through September, they made
an annual trip inland to gorge on ripe tunas (prickly-pear
fruit), traveling some 30 to 40 leagues from their homeland
on the coast. The length of these leagues presents a problem
but a figure of three miles to a league cannot be far off;
thus the distance was some 90 to 120 miles and I believe the
tuna grounds were in Atascosa County or thereabouts.
During both seasons other tribes came from far around to
take advantage of these two crops. They met, danced, feasted,
and traded during these times.
The pecan groves provided a great source of food but
possessed the defect that they gave abundant fruit one year,
but little or none the next year; at times two poor years
might pass before the trees again bore heavily. When nuts
were plentiful a further difficulty arose in that "the Indians
were very greedy with them" and people came from 20 to
30 leagues around to harvest them. This massing of Indians
at the groves resulted in all the game being immediately
flushed out and killed, so that all were hungry once more.
Extracting the nut meats is described as very laborious,
which of course is still true of the small native pecans; the
large, thin-shelled commercial pecans are a modern development. Oviedo states that some small grains were ground
up with the nuts.
The prickly pears, on the other hand, provided a constant,
abundant food supply every summer. Anyone familiar with
the tremendous expanses of prickly pear in South Texas can

Food Habits of the Texas CoastaL Indians

53

appreciate what an enormous quantity of sweet, easily digested food the tunas provided. Not only was the fruit eaten,
but pits were dug in the ground and tuna juice squeezed
into them, for there was little surface water in this country
and the Indians were constantly thirsty. It is said that there
was no pottery to hold the juice.2 The squeezed rinds were
dried and ground into a powder. Nothing else was eaten
during this season except large numbers of snails. A bitter
yellow drink was prepared from oak leaves, on which these
people became quite drunk. There was considerable ceremony about its preparation and women were forbidden to
come near during the drinking.
Aside from these two seasons, great hunger was the rule
the rest of the year. During the months before the tuna
season, some deer were killed, and crayfish and the meats
of "cockle shells" were eaten. Other foods were an herb
called yerba pedrera, blackberries, a few fish, spiders, ant
eggs, worms, salamanders, lizards, snakes (including poisonous ones), earth, wood, and deer dung. Cabeza de Vaca slyly
adds that "I verily believe that if there were any stones in
that land they would eat them too", thus revealing that the
Mariames and other tribes who held him and the other survivors had their homeland in a stoneless country. They even
kept the bones of fish, animals, and snakes, grinding them
into a powder which they could eat-a point of importance
to the archeologist when seeking to recover animal remains
in excavations.
In spite of this menu, it is said that roots of two or three
kinds were the main food in this season (the first six months
of the year) and that they "are very bad and swell those
that eat them. It takes two days to roast them and many of
them are very bitter, and on top of this it is very difficult to
dig them out." The women were able to rest only about six
2. This presents an archeological puzzle, for ample pottery is
found along the Texas coastal margin in a period which must have
included the 16th century (see article by T. N. Campbell which
precedes this one). It is possible that these tribes possessed pottery
in their homeland but did not bother to carry it to the tuna grounds,
less possible that the Rockport Focus did not exist until after 1534.

54

hours each night, spending each day searching for and digging out the roots, and stirring fires to dry and roast them
most of the night.
The men caught deer alive by running them down, following them from dawn to dark if need be. Oviedo mentions
an annual deer drive, probably in June as it was done when
the Indians were ready to move to the tuna grounds. At this
time one tribe might kill as many as two or three hundred
deer, but in some years they were unable to kill any in this
particular way. Oviedo describes the method as follows: the
people spread out from the shoreline inland, "like a wing",
and drove the deer toward the sea, using canoes to keep
them in the water until they drowned, after which the tide
washed them ashore. This method was said not to work,
however, if the wind did not blow from the sea toward the
land, "because the deer do not go except against the wind".
Probably this means that if the wind was from the north
instead of the south, the deer would smell the hunters and
could not be driven in the same direction as the wind (i. e.,
southward toward the shore). Thus the years in which no
deerr were killed in this way were probably those in which
the wind was wrong, rather than that the deer themselves
were absent. If the deer could not be driven, the Indians
proceeded to the tuna grounds, living as they could.
Those living along the lower Guadalupe River caught
some fish, but these were few unless the river was in flood.
It is said that the flood came in April and again in May.
During the second flood, a great quantity of very good fish
was killed, but most of it was wasted for they lacked salt or
any other method of preserving it.
The Indians of the central coastal area set fire to the fields
and forests for several reasons: to drive away mosquitos, to
drive lizards and other creatures out of the ground to eat
them, to kill deer by encircling them with fire, and to burn
pasture in some places so the deer would have to go to other
pastures and be easier to find and kill.
Cabeza de Vaca gives the first des,c ription known of the

Food Habits of the Texas Coastal Indians

55

American bison. The details are quite accurate and he must
have seen the animals himself. Robes, "shoes", and shields
were made of the hides. In spite of this, the bison were
probably not very near the coast, or they would have been
more important in the food resources there. Still, they must
have been within 50 leagues of the shore, which is the distance de Vaca says he went inland as a trader.

THE MONTE
In this region, starvation was the rule the year around
except during the summer tuna season. Although prickly
pears of several species undoubtedly grew throughout this
region, the natives moved about considerably within it because the tunas ripen first at the extreme south (in Tamaulipas and the Rio Grande delta area), then progressively
northward; and by the time the season is over in the northern parts (around San Antonio, say) another crop may ripen
in the south where the climate is warmer over a longer
season. At any rate, it is clear from the narratives that the
tribes in the monte shifted repeatedly in search of places
where the tunas would linger. As at the tuna grounds to
which the central coast tribes went in summer, the monte
tribes gathered here and there to visit, dance, trade, and
purchase wives.
Not only were the tunas eaten, but before they were ripe,
the green leaves of prickly-pear cacti were buried in pits
overnight to make them softer and more palatable, then
roasted. The narratives state that in this region there were
no nut trees (pecan, walnut, or oak), no streams or fish, and
nine months out of the year life hung in the balance for
everyone. All manner of insects, grubs, snakes, and creatures of every kind were consumed. Deer were killed occasionally but it is surprising that they were not numerous.
Cabeza de Vaca and his companions remained in this region for eight months after their escape from the central
coast Indians who had taken them to the tuna grounds which
they visited every summer. During these eight months, extending probably from late September 1534 to June 1535,

56

Texas Archeological Society

there was such a dearth of food that the Spaniards were too
weak to try to continue their journey toward Panuco. Although they were treated well enough in this region, and
by now had become venerated as gods through their ability
to "cure" the sick, Cabeza de Vaca says that he welcomed
the opportunity to scrape deer hides for the Indians because
this enabled him to eat the parings.
Here it is said that children were nursed to the age of 12,
after which they had to look for their own food. It is said
that the children would have died during times of famine
if they were not nursed, or at least would have grown sickly
and weak. While it may seem incredible to modern man that
children would be nursed to such an age, anthropologists
have found that this it not unusual among very primitive
people in different parts of the world who must battle constantly against starvation.
·
For about two weeks before the tunas ripened in the South
Texas monte, life was sustained by eating some "small
grains", usually identified as the seeds of the Mexican
ebony, which now grows in small groves about as far north
as Uvalde. A green fruit was also eaten at this time which
burned the mouth and which may have been unripe mesquite beans.
However, it was not until the day before the four survivors
reached the large river which I am sure must have been the
lower Rio Grande3 that the mesquite is definitely mentioned as food. The beans were ground with large wooden
pestles, about six feet long and as thick as a man's thigh,
pounded into pits in the ground. There is no mention of
mortars. The beans were mixed with earth as they were
ground, to sweeten them, and the Indians' bellies swelled
greatly from the mixture of meal, earth, and water.
3. In my extended study of the route, reasons are given for thinking that this river was crossed somewhere between Zapata and Rio
Grande City, Texas. It is quite possible that the Rio Grande was
reached by following either the Arroyo Belefio or the Arroyo Los
Olmos, in Zapata and Starr County, respectively. For the course
of Arroyo Los Olmos, see Figure 2 in the article by Frank Al Weir
in this Bulletin.

Food Habits of the Texas Coastal Indians

57

Elsewhere, as in southern Arizona in historic times, it is
known that mesquite beans provided an enormous source of
food, particularly where some method of storage was used.
Although the Cabeza de Vaca narratives give no indication
of food storage anywhere along the route until much later,
it is undoubtedly of some significance that as soon as they
met these people who ground mesquite beans near the lower
Rio Grande, figures are given on the size of the communities,
indicating that the villages were larger than :those encountered from Malhado up to this vicinity. The first people met
who used these beans had more than 50 dwellings; and the
next day, on the banks of the Rio Grande, a village was
entered which included more than 100 dwellings. In the next
day or two, other villages were seen which must have been
equally populous. Although there is no proof that the use
of mesquite beans was the direct cause of increase in village
size in this area; such a deduction seems reasonable.
SUMMARY
Only the barest details have been mentioned here from the
material in the Cabeza de Vaca narratives. They suffice to
show something of how the Indians of coastal and South
Texas managed to exist, and much of the data agree well
with archeological information from these areas, as will be
brought out in other publications. None of the people mentioned prac't iced agriculture, as Cabeza de Vaca himself
states.
One matter is quite puzzling: The food resources of these
three areas do not at present seem to be as forbidding as
the conditions actually seen by Cabeza de Vaca. This gives
rise to several interesting questions. Have the land and
food resources changed considerably in 400 years? There
are some indications that they have, especially in the mission records of the 18th century, which describe the lower
Rio Grande region as a vast expanse of rich grassland at
that time. Was the perpetual hunger of the early 16th century the result of very poor food resources, or had the population density reached the point where there was not enough

58

Texas Archeological Society

food for all? Whatever the case, it is fascinating to realize
that, despite the most trying physical conditions imaginable,
these primitive natives existed in a happy mental condition.
If there are any psychologists present, I should like to
point out two matters of great interest. One is Cabeza de
Vaca's repeated statement that "despite their hunger and
suffering, these people are the happiest in the world, constantly dancing, singing, and celebrating as though they had
no cares". A similar condition has been noted among other
peoples living a constant battle between life and starvation,
as for example the Eskimos. Gnawing hunger, cold, fatigue,
lack of any possessions to speak of, do not prevent them
from maintaining a constant cheerfulness. Or perhaps it is
the other way around: if they had any different attitude,
they might not be able to exist at all in the particular environments they happen to be in. Conversely, troubles, worries, and mental disturbances seem to increase in proportion
to wealth, possessions, and ease of living.

The other matter is that personal quarrels were settled
among these people by their beating one another to exhaustion, with no weapons allowed. Having thus taken out their
resentments, and their anger having cooled, they went about
their daily business as though nothing had happened. Here
again we have a simple but effective method for achieving
"mental health".
